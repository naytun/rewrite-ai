He stepped out and shouted, ” Lu Ming, I know that you and the saintess came from the same small continent and that you’ve known each other for a long time. However, the saintess ‘talent has not been discovered in that small continent. So, your cultivation base seems to be worthy of the saintess!</p><p>however, now that the Holy maiden’s talent has bloomed, she’s a person from a completely different world from you. The difference between you and the Holy maiden is too great. If you’re sensible, leave the Holy maiden on your own and don’t delay her!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”In other words, you’re saying that you’re very strong and talented?”</p><p>“Of course, how can we be compared to you!”</p><p>Someone sneered in response.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a contemptuous smile and said, I, Lu Ming, have risen from the divine wilderness continent, a small remote continent. I’m 26 years old now, and my cultivation is at the second level of the Martial Emperor realm. As for you, you claim to be the pride of the heavens and were born in the yuan continent. Under such a good environment, at this age, your cultivation is only at your level. How can you have the face to act so high and mighty in front of me? if you give me a few years, I will definitely trample all of you under my feet!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was sonorous and powerful. It spread far and wide, causing the young geniuses of the Tian Yu demon sect to have ugly expressions.</p><p>“Arrogant! Who Do You Think You Are? You even said that you would trample us under your feet!”</p><p>he’s a King on a wild island and thinks he can do the same in the yuan continent. He’s really looking at the sky from a lower position and overestimating his own ability!</p><p>All the young men shouted.</p><p>There was even one person who took a big step forward, releasing his aura as he shouted angrily, ” kid, I’m also at the second level of the martial Royal realm. Do you dare to fight me? ”</p><p>“If you want to fight, then let’s fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming let go of Xie nianqing and strode out.</p><p>kid, even if we’re at the same level, I’ll let you know what combat strength is. I’ll defeat you in ten moves!</p><p>die! the young man shouted coldly. Demonic Qi surged into the sky. He was like a demonic god. With a wave of his hands, a terrifying demonic light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he suddenly took a step forward.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had already cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to its peak. A casual step was like Nine Dragons trampling the sky, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in the air and the void trembled. Then, a Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens. Nine Dragons flew out from under Lu Ming’s feet and pounced at the other party.</p><p>The other party’s demonic light was directly destroyed by the nine Dragons, and then heavily hit the other party’s body.</p><p>The other party let out a blood-curdling screech as the bones in his body crackled. His body was sent flying and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>It flew for over a thousand meters before it finally came to a stop. Disbelief was reflected in its eyes.</p><p>Defeated in one move!</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>He mumbled to himself, finding it hard to bear.</p><p>A moment ago, he had been acting all high and mighty, wanting to teach Lu Ming, an ant from a Savage Island, a lesson in the name of the pride of the yuan continent. He had even said that even if they were of the same level, he would let Lu Ming know what combat power was and defeat him in ten moves.</p><p>However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>In response to what he had just said, he was simply too ashamed to show his face. He wished he could find a crack and hide in it.</p><p>The expressions of the other young men from the sky demon sect changed.</p><p>The young man from before had a low-grade earth spiritual body and his combat strength could crush other martial artists of the same level. However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move. This made them reevaluate Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight? My cultivation is at the early stage of the second level Martial Emperor realm. All of you at or below the fourth level Martial Emperor realm can come and fight me. If you can defeat me, I’ll turn around and leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the entire scene and his voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>“What? Anyone at or below the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm can fight. How arrogant, how arrogant!”</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The young men of the Tian Yu demonic sect roared.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that anyone in the fourth level of the martial Royal realm or below from the Tian Yu demon sect could fight.</p><p>He was merely at the early stage of the LV 2 martial Royal realm, yet he dared to say that Zhan Tianyu demon sect’s LV 4 martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite was arrogant beyond belief.</p><p>kid, don’t think that you’re so great just because you defeated someone at the same level. I’ll fight you!</p><p>you’re courting death! a young man shouted and strode out. A powerful aura burst out, forming a demonic cloud that covered the void.</p><p>This person had a cultivation of the third level of the martial Royal realm!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He took a step forward and it was still the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>With every step Lu Ming took, the sky rumbled, as if a giant was walking in the sky.</p><p>In an instant, he took nine steps in succession, and a huge nine Dragon flew out and pounced at the other party.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The other party roared loudly. His demonic might was vast and mighty. He threw dozens of punches in a row, and black fist gleams were blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the nine Dragons pounced over, and the fist radiance collapsed. It couldn’t withstand a single blow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just like the young man before him, the nine Dragons pounced on the young man’s body. He let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Another move!</p><p>Just like the young man from before, he was defeated in a single move.</p><p>There seemed to be no difference between the third level and the second level of the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The only difference was that Lu Ming had taken a few more steps.</p><p>The young men from the Tian Yu demonic sect looked at each other in shock. Lu Ming’s combat strength was actually so terrifying? Was this still a person from a mere Savage Island?</p><p>Behind them, Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming was getting stronger!</p><p>Hmph, maybe he used all his strength in that move just now. It’s just a show of strength!</p><p>A cold voice came from the crowd.</p><p>It was demonic Jie!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. Perhaps it was true!</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming’s move just now seemed simple, but it was very likely that he had used all his strength and his trump card to defeat his opponent and win.</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached its limit!</p><p>That must be the case, many people thought.</p><p>Otherwise, how could they accept that a lowly ant from a barbaric Island had such strong combat strength?</p><p>“Mojie, my defeated opponent, do you dare to come out and fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at demonic Jie and said coldly.</p><p>Demonic Jie’s face darkened.</p><p>In the great Emperor’s Secret realm, he had indeed fought with Lu Ming before. He was not Lu Ming’s match at all.</p><p>mo Jie, go on. Let this kid know the true power of our Tian Yu demon sect’s Paragon!</p><p>“That’s right. With your combat strength, you can easily take him down!”</p><p>The other young men from the Tian Yu demonic sect spoke, causing mo Jie’s expression to turn even gloomier.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to fight me? Should I just admit defeat? Also, all of you can get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>arrogant! Demonic Jie, teach him a good lesson!</p><p>A young man was furious.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Mojie stepped forward and stared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.”Lu Ming, times have changed. I can defeat you now!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from mojie’s body!</p><p>Peak Lv 3 martial Royal realm!</p><p>It had only been a short while since the end of the great emperor secret realm, but mo Jie’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the third level of the Martial Emperor realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
