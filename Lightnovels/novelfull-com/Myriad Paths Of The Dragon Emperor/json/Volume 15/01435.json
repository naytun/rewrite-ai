There were countless of them.</p><p>Countless heavenly Dao stones formed a stone bridge that was a hundred miles long, leading to the other side of the abyss.</p><p>Heavens, how many heavenly Dao stones were there?</p><p>His heart twitched.</p><p>Was this the work of the great emperor? It was truly too shocking.</p><p>it’s impossible to excavate the heavenly Dao stone on the stone bridge. Someone tried it before, but they were shaken down the abyss!</p><p>The eldest of the three Ruan brothers, ruan Tian, explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had already guessed this. Otherwise, with so many heavenly Dao stones in front of him, this place would have long been covered in blood.</p><p>Many young men had gathered at the head of the bridge. They looked at the stone bridge with worried expressions.</p><p>“Someone’s on the bridge again!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said in a low voice.</p><p>At the end of the bridge, a young man stepped onto the stone bridge.</p><p>When he stepped onto the stone bridge, he seemed to feel a terrifying pressure. His body trembled slightly, but he gritted his teeth and continued forward.</p><p>After walking for a while, his body suddenly trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>He quickly retreated from the stone bridge and let out a long breath.</p><p>“Still no!”</p><p>The young man sighed.</p><p>Hmph, you’re really trash. Let me do it!</p><p>A cold voice sounded. A young man walked out of the crowd and stepped onto the stone bridge.</p><p>“Wang Xiao!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Wang Xiao’s body emanated a sharp aura, like a divine sword that could slice apart anything.</p><p>He walked forward step by step at a very fast speed. Soon, he had covered more than half of the distance. After that, his speed gradually slowed down. However, it didn’t take long for him to cross the hundred-mile stone bridge and disappear from everyone’s sight.</p><p>“A leader-level figure is indeed powerful!”</p><p>“This stone bridge can only be crossed by a heaven’s favorite with a low-tier earth spiritual body!”</p><p>the heavenly Dao aura on it is too strong!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>“As expected, it’s because of the heavenly Dao aura!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>There were too many heavenly Dao stones on the stone bridge. The aura of heavenly Dao on this stone bridge was definitely terrifying.</p><p>The aura of the heavenly path was very useful to both Warriors and inscription Masters. They could use it to comprehend the path and raise their cultivation.</p><p>However, this was only the heavenly Dao aura. Within a certain concentration and range, if the heavenly Dao aura was too dense, not only would it not be beneficial, it would also be harmful.</p><p>The powerful aura of the heavenly Dao could crush people to death!</p><p>The stone bridge in front of them was just like that!</p><p>damn it. It was not easy for me to enter Emperor Cang’s chamber. Am I going to be blocked by a stone bridge? I can’t accept this!</p><p>“I’m really unwilling, but I can’t do anything about it!”</p><p>Many people sighed. This was Emperor Cang’s Palace. Perhaps, as long as they crossed this stone bridge, they would be at the center of Emperor Cang’s Palace. Perhaps, there would be countless treasures and even Emperor Cang’s inheritance waiting for them.</p><p>But now, their path was blocked by a stone bridge. It was hard to accept this.</p><p>Then, more and more people tried, but most of them failed. Some tried to force their way in, but they were crushed to death and fell into the endless abyss.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying, ruan Tian, and the rest did not stop him. They knew how powerful Lu Ming was. This stone bridge could not do anything to him.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and the chaos Domain covered his entire body.</p><p>“What a dense heavenly Dao aura!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>The aura of the heavenly Dao here was too powerful. It was many times stronger than the heavenly Dao engravings that Lu Ming had faced previously.</p><p>This kind of power was far beyond what they could bear at their level. Not only could they not comprehend the Dao from it, but they also felt a strong pressure on their bodies.</p><p>This was the pressure of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain shook and the pressure from the heavenly Dao disappeared without a trace.</p><p>everything in the world comes from the chaos. The chaos realm, the Emperor of thousands of realms, and the aura of the heavenly Dao are useless against the chaos realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, he continued forward.</p><p>The stone bridge was very narrow and could only allow one person to pass. Lu Ming strode forward and very quickly, he had covered half the distance.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming suddenly turned around and went back the way he came.</p><p>“Hmm, what is this person doing? I thought he could pass the test easily. Why did he return now?”</p><p>it doesn’t mean anything if he was relaxed at the start. Perhaps he was more relaxed when he charged forward with all his might. It’s normal for him to be lacking in strength now!</p><p>“That’s true, this stone bridge isn’t something anyone can cross!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s actions caused some people to discuss.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, and the others were also surprised.</p><p>Based on their understanding of Lu Ming, he should have no problem crossing the stone bridge given his abilities. Why did he return the way he came?</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming reached the bridge.</p><p>“Ying Ying, brother Qiu, come up. I’ll bring you over!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>What?</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, and the three Ruan brothers were all stunned.</p><p>The others were also stunned!</p><p>Lu Ming had returned and he actually wanted to bring people over?</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>It would be difficult for anyone to go there alone, and even a genius like Wang Xiao would find it difficult to reach the second half of the journey. And now, Lu Ming was saying that he wanted to bring someone along.</p><p>This was really hard to believe.</p><p>“Yingying …”</p><p>Lu Ming called out again. Qiu Yingying and Qiu Hao finally reacted.</p><p>“Ah, okay!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying was the first to step forward and stood in front of Lu Ming, while Qiu Hao stood behind him.</p><p>Stepping onto the stone bridge meant that their lives were in danger. However, they chose to believe in Lu Ming. He had brought them too many miracles along the way.</p><p>“Brother ruan, I’ll send Yingying and the others over first. I’ll come and find you later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to ruan Tian.</p><p>“Ah, okay!”</p><p>Ruan Tian nodded in a daze, still a little confused.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The chaos Domain enveloped Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao, and the three of them stepped onto the stone bridge.</p><p>Although the chaos realm was wonderful, it was only at level one. Moreover, the stone bridge was very narrow and could only allow one person to walk. Therefore, Lu Ming could not bring too many people at one time. He could only bring two to three people.</p><p>Therefore, he planned to send Qiu Ying Ying and the others over before returning to send the three Ruan brothers over.</p><p>Everyone was looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>Some people sneered, thinking that Lu Ming would play with fire and die Here.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two stepped onto the stone bridge. The powerful heavenly Dao aura outside pressed down on the chaos realm, causing it to tremble. However, it managed to withstand it in the end.</p><p>The three of them walked forward step by step. Very soon, they had covered the distance that Lu Ming had covered and continued to move forward.</p><p>Soon, the three of them successfully reached the other side.</p><p>“Success! This person can actually bring people over!”</p><p>unbelievable! This person must have some kind of treasure that can resist the aura of the heavenly Dao!</p><p>Lu Ming’s success caused a commotion at the scene.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
