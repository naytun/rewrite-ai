There were at least ten of them.</p><p>The few white-haired elders were also slightly stunned.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He had killed many enemies in the great emperor secret realm. These people were all geniuses and many of them had an Emperor spiritual weapon. Lu Ming had many of them.</p><p>The ones he had taken out were all useless to him. There were hammer-type, axe-type, and ring-type Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>These spirit weapons were equivalent to scrap metal in Lu Ming’s hands. He might as well hand them over to the sect in exchange for useful resources.</p><p>a total of fifteen Emperor spiritual weapons, worth fifteen million medium-grade raw stones. Do you want to exchange them for raw stones or sect contribution points? ”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked.</p><p>“Exchange it for sect contribution points!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>There were quite a number of intermediate-grade rough stones in the storage rings of the enemies he had killed. It was enough for Lu Ming to use for a period of time.</p><p>If they were exchanged for sect contribution points, they could be used to exchange for other treasures.</p><p>alright, we’ll register it. Do you have any other treasures to hand over? ”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked again.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and his palm glowed. This time, two weapons appeared.</p><p>One of them was a combat sword. As soon as the combat sword was drawn, there was a shocking sword Qi that broke through the clouds.</p><p>The other item was a small knife the size of a palm. It was surrounded by a green mist and gave off a disgusting smell.</p><p>“Two Saint weapons!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the two Saint weapons.</p><p>Some people’s gazes were burning.</p><p>it’s actually a holy weapon. It seems that the harvest in the great emperor secret realm is really rich!</p><p>“Who is this person? He should be from another continent, but to be able to obtain two Saint weapons, what a great opportunity!”</p><p>Many people discussed animatedly and were extremely envious.</p><p>The great emperor secret realm was something that could only be encountered by chance. Unfortunately, only those below the cultivation of a Martial Emperor could enter, and most people had surpassed this realm.</p><p>The white-haired elders “eyes also lit up. This was the first time someone had handed over a Saint weapon.</p><p>these two are bright Saint weapons. They’re a hundred times more valuable than King spiritual weapons. Would you like to exchange them for contribution points or mid-grade origin stones? ”</p><p>The white-haired elder asked as he took the two Saint weapons and examined them.</p><p>“I’ll exchange them all for contribution points!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, two bright Saint weapons and fifteen Emperor spirit weapons. That’s a total of two million one hundred and fifty thousand contribution points. Is there anything else you want to hand over?”</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at Lu Ming with some hope.</p><p>“No more!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Over two million contribution points should be enough to use for a while.</p><p>“That can’t be right, Lu Ming. The treasures you’ve obtained should be more than this, right?”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice sounded.</p><p>Without looking, Lu Ming could tell that it was yinfeng’s voice.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Yin Feng and said,”I don’t have anything else to hand over!”</p><p>“No more? Who are you trying to fool? where’s that wing-shaped holy weapon of yours? What about the other treasures? You should have gained a lot, why don’t you take it out and hand it over to the sect?”</p><p>Yin Feng sneered.</p><p>I do have other treasures, but I can use them. Elder Hong also said that I can keep those that I can use. If you have a treasure that you can use, will you hand it over? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a cold smile.</p><p>of course I will. I’m doing this for the sect!</p><p>Yin Feng said.</p><p>Oh, I forgot. A piece of trash like you won’t be able to get any treasures. Naturally, you’re willing to hand them over!</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“You … Who are you calling trash?”</p><p>Yin Feng was furious.</p><p>“Are you not? Do you want to have a fight with me to prove that you’re not a waste?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Yin Feng was at a loss for words. He was well aware of Lu Ming’s combat strength. It was extremely terrifying. If they were to fight, he would only be crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You don’t even dare to fight, what are you if not trash?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>Yin Feng’s body trembled with anger, but he couldn’t refute.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I remember that you obtained a Saint breakthrough pill. You have no use for it now. Why don’t you hand it over?”</p><p>At this moment, he Yu, who was standing beside yinfeng, spoke coldly and his voice resounded throughout the entire place.</p><p>“What? A Saint breakthrough pill?”</p><p>At this moment, the entire place fell silent. Countless eyes were fixed on Lu Ming. Many people revealed a burning glow.</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill. Lu Ming had actually obtained a Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Some people’s breathing even became heavy.</p><p>There were many people surrounding the square. Many of them were at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm, but they were stuck there, unable to break through.</p><p>Some people were even at the end of their lifespans. The temptation of the Saint breakthrough pill was too great for them.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that they were in Dragon God Valley, where there were sages, some people would have already started fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He Yu’s move was extremely sinister.</p><p>If he did not hand over the Saint breakthrough pill, there would be countless pairs of eyes staring at him in the Dragon God Valley. In the future, unless Lu Ming did not leave the Dragon God Valley, who knew if someone would secretly attack him?</p><p>This move was ruthless enough!</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you have the Saint breakthrough pill, why don’t you hand it over and make a contribution to the sect? you have no use for such a treasure now. Besides, you might die at any time. Such a treasure is a waste!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed. He could not be bothered with Yin Feng and he Yu. He bowed to the few white-haired elders and said,”Senior, I have nothing else to hand in. Can I register?”</p><p>“Sure, please register!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and was about to register.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from afar. Then, an old man in silver robes suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>When elder Hong and the other white-haired old men saw the silver-robed old man, their expressions changed. They stood up and bowed, saying, ” master of Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>Many people around the square also saluted.</p><p>“What? The master of Silver Dragon Valley? The master of the silver Dragon Valley, one of the seven great valleys?”</p><p>In the middle of the square, the young men who had not yet officially become disciples of Dragon God Valley were all shocked.</p><p>The seven great dragon Valley Masters were all important figures who stood at the peak of Dragon God Valley. Even in the vast Azure region, they were top figures.</p><p>Now, the master of the silver Dragon Valley, one of the seven great dragon Valley Masters, had actually come in person.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>master! seeing the master of Silver Dragon Valley, Yin Feng cried out in surprise, which made many people gasp.</p><p>Yin Feng’s grandfather was the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. Yinfeng’s background was beyond his imagination.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley descended and nodded. “What happened just now?”</p><p>it’s him. That brat from the savage Island obtained a treasure in the great emperor secret realm and wants to pocket it. He has no use for a treasure like the Saint breakthrough pill now!</p><p>Yinfeng pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
