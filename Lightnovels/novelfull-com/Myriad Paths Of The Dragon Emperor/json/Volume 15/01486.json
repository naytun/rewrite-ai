The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile as he said,”I killed Xu long because Xu long wanted to kill me first. Do you think I can’t fight back and let him kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard and everyone fell silent!</p><p>...</p><p>“Nonsense! Xu long has no enmity with you. Why would he want to kill you? ridiculous!”</p><p>Yinfeng scolded.</p><p>“Do I have to ask you this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yin Feng and sneered, as if he was implying something.</p><p>Yin Feng’s expression changed slightly, then he sneered, ” “Lu Ming, Xu long is dead. You can say whatever you want since the dead can’t testify. However, you can’t change the fact no matter how much you say. The fact is that you killed Xu long with your own hands. The evidence is irrefutable. You can’t change that. You must accept your punishment!”</p><p>“Yinfeng, why are you in such a hurry? Since you all want to know the truth, I’ll tell you!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Yin Feng indifferently and said, that time, when we were on a mission, we met a strong enemy. Duan Yan, Fu Xing, and Zhang Kong were all killed by the strong enemy. Xu long even surrendered to the enemy and was controlled by the enemy. He wanted to kill me, so I killed him.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the mission.</p><p>nonsense! As far as I know, Duan Yan and Fu Xing are both at the LV 3 Martial Emperor realm, while Xu long is at the LV 4 Martial Emperor realm. You met a strong enemy and both of them died, but you, a mere ant from a Savage Island, survived. Isn’t that ridiculous? do you really think we’re fools? ”</p><p>Yin Feng sneered.</p><p>“You’re not an idiot, you’re an idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Yin Feng’s expression was ugly.</p><p>let me tell you. There’s only one reason why they’re dead and I’m not. It’s because I’m strong!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Because I’m strong!</p><p>It was a very simple reason but it explained everything. Why did Xu long and the rest die but Lu Ming did not?</p><p>It was because Lu Ming was strong and he was stronger. That was why he did not die.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re strong? Xu Long’s cultivation is at Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm. You’re just an ant from a Savage Island who has just broken through to the Martial Emperor realm not long ago. How dare you say you’re strong? what a joke! I’ll see how strong you are. Men, take him down!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>As soon as Yin Feng’s voice fell, two young men from the Dragon Punishment Hall rushed out from behind him. Each of them held a Dragon lock chain in their hands as they pounced on Lu Ming and shouted,”Surrender!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took a few steps forward.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst forth, and the earth trembled. The ground trembled like waves, and a terrifying force surged toward the two youths of the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two young men of the dragon punishment Palace were shocked. They spat out a mouthful of blood and were sent flying.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>With just a few steps, Lu Ming had injured two third level martial Royal realm youths of the Dragon Punishment Hall. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>how dare you resist arrest? you’re courting death!</p><p>Someone shouted from behind Yin Feng. A few figures rushed out with violent auras. Before they even arrived, their powerful Qi swept towards Lu Ming like a Gale.</p><p>The fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The three Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He shouted and swung his fists continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fist force seemed to be able to penetrate the void and hit the three fourth level martial Royal realm youths.</p><p>The terrifying fist force instantly shattered the attack and defense of the three Dragon punishment halls. The three of them were sent flying like kites with broken strings. They flew out of the cloud Dragon Valley and fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>With one move, three Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts of the Dragon Punishment Hall were injured and sent flying. What kind of combat strength was this?</p><p>Xu long, a Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm martial artist is nothing.</p><p>At this moment, they recalled what Lu Ming said earlier.</p><p>Because I’m strong!</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming was strong. Hence, he did not die, but Xu long and the rest did.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Yin Feng roared in his heart, and his eyes were filled with jealousy.</p><p>Lu Ming had become stronger after not seeing him for a while. How did an ant from a Savage Island become so strong? This caused a chill to appear in the depths of Yin Feng’s heart.</p><p>The stronger Lu Ming was, the greater the danger he would be in. He must not let Lu Ming grow.</p><p>this man is lawless and has harmed his fellow disciples. He’s like an evil demon. Now, he even dares to injure the people of the Dragon Punishment Hall. He deserves to be killed. Everyone, I suggest that we kill him on the spot as a warning to the others!</p><p>Yin Feng’s voice was heard.</p><p>“That’s right, kill him on the spot!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out.</p><p>More than a dozen experts of the Dragon Punishment Hall rushed out from behind Yin Feng, and their powerful auras burst out.</p><p>Two of them were at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm, while the rest were at the fifth and fourth levels.</p><p>So many experts wanted to kill Lu Ming here and now.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A youth at the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm shouted and pounced toward Lu Ming like a true dragon. His violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The cultivation of a peak Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert was much higher than his.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to go all out, a white figure suddenly appeared in front of him and threw a punch at the youth at the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The fist wasn’t big, but it exuded a domineering aura that could destroy everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The arm of the youth at the peak of the LV 6 martial Royal realm exploded. He flew back for thousands of meters and fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, the figure threw a dozen punches in a row. The dozen experts of the Dragon punishment Palace were sent flying with blood-curdling screeches.</p><p>let’s see who dares to be impudent in Cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>A delicate voice rang out.</p><p>“Eighth Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>The person who had suddenly appeared and dealt a heavy blow to the Dragon Punishment Hall’s experts was Lu Ming’s eighth Senior Sister, Xue ningxin.</p><p>That Snow Dragon!</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, are you alright?”</p><p>Xue ningxin asked with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“You … What are you doing? How dare you injure so many people of the Dragon punishment Palace? how dare you …”</p><p>Yin Feng pointed at Xue ningxin and scolded.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xue ningxin shouted angrily, her face was covered with a layer of frost, ” you’ve trespassed Cloud Dragon Valley and captured my Junior Brother. If you take one more step forward, I won’t just hurt them. I’ll break your dog heads!</p><p>An ice-cold killing intent emanated from Xue ningxin’s body.</p><p>Many people swallowed their saliva.</p><p>So domineering. If they took one more step, she would directly smash their dog heads.</p><p>This was lawless.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. He did not expect this Senior Sister to be so overbearing. He suddenly felt that he was too kind.</p><p>Xue ningxin, the Dragon Punishment Hall handles matters impartially. Your Junior Brother has killed a fellow disciple, and the evidence is irrefutable. He must be brought to the Dragon Punishment Hall to be punished!</p><p>A young man from the Dragon Punishment Hall beside Yin Feng spoke. A shocking aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Seventh level Martial Emperor realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
