I had a big fight, but my master took a fancy to me. My master is the sect master of the Tianyu demonic sect, and she took me in as a true disciple. Later, I was tested to have a rare innate demonic body, so I was named the Tianyu demonic sect’s Holy Virgin!</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>...</p><p>innate demon body? is it a type of innate spirit body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This was a possibility. In the divine wilderness continent, the cultivation level was too low. Some heaven-defying talents could not be discovered or discovered.</p><p>However, it was different in the yuan continent.</p><p>Moreover, there were many types of innate spirit bodies.</p><p>For example, Yin Feng’s innate spiritual body was considered the worst among the innate spiritual bodies. After breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm, he could only transform into a low-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>Some powerful innate spiritual bodies could transform into medium grade or even superior grade earth spiritual bodies, or even stronger.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s innate demonic body might be extraordinary, which was why he was named the Holy Virgin of the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming noticed that Xie nianqing’s cultivation was higher than his. He had reached the peak of the third level Martial Emperor realm and was only one step away from the fourth level.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why Xie nianqing did not go to the great Emperor’s Secret realm. It was very likely that Xie nianqing had already broken through to the Martial Emperor realm and could not enter the great Emperor’s Secret realm.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming briefly recounted his experiences along the way.</p><p>“Little Qing, that Liu Yu doesn’t seem to get along with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. She and I are both saintesses and are qualified to compete for the future sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect. She brought you here to see me to ruin my reputation. She has no good intentions!</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>Although there was no rule in the Tianyu demonic sect that the saintess was not allowed to interact with others, under normal circumstances, it was hoped that the saintess would try not to interact with others before breaking through to the Saint realm as it would distract her.</p><p>Liu Yu had intentionally brought Lu Ming in to look for Xie nianqing. She wanted to let the others know that Xie nianqing had a boyfriend and that they were dating. This way, Xie nianqing would have a bad impression on the higher-ups of the Tian Yu demon sect. His chances of competing for the position of sect leader would be reduced.</p><p>This was Liu Yu’s purpose in bringing Lu Ming in.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curved into a smile. if she wants to compete for the sect master’s position, then so be it. I don’t care about the sect master’s position anyway!</p><p>“Little Qing, whether you have a heart or not, you still have to be careful in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming was concerned.</p><p>“Yes, I know!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while.</p><p>At this time, the news that a strange man in the LV 2 martial Royal realm was the boyfriend of the saintess, Xie nianqing, spread throughout the entire Tian Yu demonic sect, causing a huge uproar.</p><p>a second level martial Royal realm thug is actually the saint’s boyfriend. This is preposterous!</p><p>“A Toad lusting after a Swan’s flesh. I want him to understand that he’s not worthy of the Saint.”</p><p>The voices of the young men were filled with anger and jealousy.</p><p>Of course, Xie nianqing and Lu Ming did not know about this.</p><p>The two of them were still in a state of intimacy.</p><p>A few hours later.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s rare for you to come to the Tian Yu demon sect. I’ll show you around. There are some places in the Tian Yu demon sect that are not bad!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two of them walked out of the palace, hand in hand, and strolled around the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>However, he was stopped by a young man after a short while.</p><p>“Audacious fanatic, how dare you take liberties with the Holy maiden, you deserve to die!”</p><p>The young man bellowed. When he saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing holding hands, his eyes burned with jealousy.</p><p>Xie nianqing was a legend in the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>She came from a small continent and was recruited by the emissary of the Tianyu demon sect. As soon as she arrived, she was taken in as a true disciple by the sect master of the Tianyu demon sect. Later, it was found that she had a rare innate demon body and she was immediately conferred the title of saintess.</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing was devastatingly beautiful. Some of the beautiful women in the Tian Yu demon sect couldn’t help but pale in comparison.</p><p>Naturally, Xie nianqing became the goddess in the hearts of countless young men in the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing had a cold personality. He treated everyone with a cold look and had a strange temper. No young man could make him smile.</p><p>But now, Xie nianqing’s boyfriend suddenly appeared, and he was even holding hands with Xie nianqing. This made the young man so angry that his lungs almost exploded. He was so jealous that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cold voice came from his mouth.</p><p>“Holy maiden, this person is a good-for-nothing! You have to think twice and not be deceived!”</p><p>The young man roared.</p><p>“Get lost, you only have three breaths of time!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly as a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The young man’s expression was ugly. He cast a warning glance at Lu Ming, then turned around and left.</p><p>“Little Qing, it seems that you’re very popular in the Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming and smiled flirtatiously. If the young men from the Tian Yu demon sect were to see Xie nianqing like this, they would probably be dumbfounded.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you jealous? Feeling the pressure? I have many suitors in the Tianyu demonic sect, including the geniuses of other sects. Some of them are even at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m a little jealous, but I’m not stressed. I don’t care about these people at all. In a few years, they won’t be my match!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, full of confidence.</p><p>“Really shameless!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled, but his face was filled with happiness.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly looked ahead.</p><p>In front of him, streaks of light streaked across the sky. Even from a distance, Lu Ming could see that they were young men, all flying toward him in anger.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. you said that I’m smug. Then I’ll show you how smug I am!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming wrapped his arm around Xie nianqing’s slender waist and pulled him into his arms.</p><p>“How dare you! Let go of your stinky hands!”</p><p>“Lowly ant, How dare you! I’m going to cripple your hands!”</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>A group of young men appeared in front of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. When they saw that Lu Ming was hugging Xie nianqing, their eyes were about to spit fire. Their faces were red with anger, and they wanted to eat Lu Ming alive.</p><p>How detestable. The Holy, noble, and high and mighty saintess was actually in this guy’s arms. At the thought of this, they wished they could cut Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>“All of you, get lost. It’s not your place to meddle in my business!”</p><p>Xie nianqing scolded coldly.</p><p>“Holy maiden, you’re still young. Don’t be deceived by this man.”</p><p>that’s right. You have unparalleled talent, which is rare in the world. You should find a man with the same talent to date. For example, me. This man is only a second level martial Royal realm trash!</p><p>The young men spoke up one by one.</p><p>“Demonic Jie!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed a familiar face in the crowd. It was mo Jie. He was the leader of the Tian Yu demonic sect who had entered the great emperor secret realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
