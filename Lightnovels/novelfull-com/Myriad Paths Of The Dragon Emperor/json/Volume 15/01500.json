Many people were deeply shocked when they looked at Tian Chui.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was at the third level of the martial Royal realm, could easily crush those at the fifth level.</p><p>Now, Tian Chui, who was at the peak of the fifth level Martial Emperor realm, was suppressing a seventh level Martial Emperor.</p><p>The disciples of the sky cloud Valley were terrifying!</p><p>“This is your combat strength? This is the battle strength of Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm. It’s really rare and ordinary. People of Silver Dragon Valley are all arrogant, despotic, and supercilious, but they’re all trash!”</p><p>Tian Chui lifted his giant hammer and waved it around. A loud whooshing sound rang out as his disdainful voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Ding Mao’s face was unsightly, but he couldn’t argue back. The truth was right in front of him, he was no match for Tian Chui.</p><p>The other disciples of Silver Dragon Valley blushed, but no one dared to say anything.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll let you off this time. Let’s go!”</p><p>Ding Mao glared at Lu Ming coldly before turning to leave the floating platform.</p><p>The other disciples of the silver Dragon Valley, including the Silver City, also wanted to leave.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Ding Mao stopped and turned to Lu Ming.”What else do you want? Don’t think that I’m really afraid of you guys.”</p><p>“I’m not looking for you, I’m looking for him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on Blizzard Silver City. you owe me 500000 contribution points. Pay up before you leave!</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The silver Blizzard city roared.</p><p>Just now, he was forced to kneel in front of Lu Ming in one move. This was a great humiliation, and he wanted to skin Lu Ming alive.</p><p>“Don’t even think? You bet with me and lost 500000 contribution points, and now you want to go back on your word? I’ve said it before, if you don’t pay up today, don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold.</p><p>“I told you, I was just saying it casually!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City said with a cold face.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re just saying? “It turns out that the words of the people of Silver Dragon Valley are all nonsense.” Fine, if you admit it, everyone in Silver Dragon Valley is bullshitting. Then I will pretend that this never happened!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … I …”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City was tongue-tied, how could he admit to this?</p><p>This was not his personal matter, but the entire Silver Dragon Valley’s. In Silver Dragon Valley, there were the valley master, elders and some heaven’s pride experts. How could he represent Silver Dragon Valley? if he really admitted it, he could forget about staying in Silver Dragon Valley in the future.</p><p>“Bet? Are there any witnesses?”</p><p>Ding Mao said coldly.</p><p>“Everyone here is a witness!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the scene.</p><p>“Oh? Was it? Who witnessed this?”</p><p>Ding Mao’s eyes swept across the crowd with a threatening look.</p><p>since you’re all witnesses, you’d better not lie and speak the truth!</p><p>On the side, Tian Chui opened his mouth. His gaze was like that of a wild beast as it swept across the entire place. if I find out who’s lying, this hammer of mine is too slippery, and I often can’t hold it steadily. In the future, if such a big hammer suddenly falls off your head when you’re out, don’t blame me!</p><p>As he spoke, Tian Chui’s hand slipped, and the water tank-like hammer fell to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground rumbled, and a deep pit was smashed into the ground, with cracks like a spider web.</p><p>Many people sucked in a breath of cold air. The ground here was extremely hard, but Tian Chui’s hammer was actually able to smash the ground to such an extent. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>The weight of this hammer was too shocking. If it were to hit a person, it would definitely end up with broken bones and tendons. Those with weak cultivation would be smashed to death.</p><p>“They … They have a bet!”</p><p>A timid voice was heard. It was still the same timid young woman from before.</p><p>Ding Mao’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>that’s right. They made a bet on who would step onto the higher floating platform and who would be the winner. In the end, Lu Ming won!</p><p>“There is such a thing!”</p><p>At this moment, the others also spoke up.</p><p>For one, they were afraid of Tian Chui. For two, the people of Silver Dragon Valley were too overbearing, which made them unhappy.</p><p>The people from the silver Blizzard city started to speak, and their expressions became extremely ugly.</p><p>if you agree to a bet, you must accept your loss. Quickly hand over your contribution points. Otherwise, you can stand still and take a hit from my hammer!</p><p>Tian Chui said with a grin.</p><p>The silver Blizzard city’s entire body trembled. What a joke, taking a hit from the heavenly hammer, wasn’t that courting death?</p><p>“Since you’ve lost, you should give me some contribution points!”</p><p>Ding Mao said coldly.</p><p>Just now, he had suffered some injuries from the battle with Tian Chui and needed to go back to recuperate. Furthermore, those were the blizzard Silver city’s contribution points, not his. He wanted to leave this place as soon as possible to avoid losing face.</p><p>Blizzard Silver City was on the verge of tears. Dante had already spoken. Today, he had to hand over the money, even if he didn’t want to. Otherwise, he really wouldn’t be able to leave this place.</p><p>In the end, the silver Blizzard city had no choice but to transfer 500000 contribution points to Lu Ming’s identity Jade card. Lu Ming’s identity Jade card had an additional 500000 contribution points.</p><p>The blizzard Silver city’s heart was bleeding. He only had a total of 500000 contribution points, and now he was left with only a fraction.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ding Mao snorted and left with his men.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, seventh senior brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Tian Chui.</p><p>“Haha, we’re fellow disciples, what’s there to be polite about?”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed, ” the moment I came back, I heard about Junior brother’s deeds. In front of that old man Yin Zheng, you killed his precious grandson. It’s really satisfying. You’re a man. I originally wanted to find you for a drink, but you weren’t here, so I came to the sky-connecting floating platform to cultivate. I didn’t expect to meet you here, haha!</p><p>Tian Chui laughed out loud, extremely forthright.</p><p>isn’t drinking easy? I’ve just earned a lot of contribution points, so I can drink at any time!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Tian Chui’s personality was similar to Yan kuangtu’s, and Lu Ming had a good impression of him.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be waiting!”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming walked toward the timid woman and said, ” “Thank you for speaking out for justice just now, but I have yet to ask for your name!”</p><p>“I … I’m su Lei!”</p><p>The young woman said. Her voice was still a little timid, very Myanmar.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Lu Ming found out that su Lei was a disciple of the purple dragon Valley.</p><p>Junior Brother, they just said that you won the bet against the silver Blizzard city. Which platform did you step on? ”</p><p>Tian Chui curiously asked.</p><p>“I just passed the sixth platform and I came down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“He passed the sixth platform? Can we continue?”</p><p>Tian Chui curiously asked.</p><p>“I should … I guess so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had integrated the chaos Domain with the thirteen accumulated strikes, which greatly increased his power. It was quite easy for him to cross the sixth platform. Lu Ming estimated that he should be able to handle it on the seventh platform.</p><p>a third-level domain Esper who can step onto the seventh floating platform. What a freak!</p><p>Tian Chui widened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming with an exaggerated expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
