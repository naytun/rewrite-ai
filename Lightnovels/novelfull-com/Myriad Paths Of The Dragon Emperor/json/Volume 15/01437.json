Black wings!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>...</p><p>The bright Saint weapon was the exclusive weapon of the bright Saint.</p><p>Above that, there were great saint weapons and absolute Saint weapons!</p><p>After a round of refinement, Lu Ming had only gained a preliminary grasp of this holy weapon. He could not refine it completely with his current cultivation. He could only refine it slowly in the future and deepen his grasp of the black wings.</p><p>He tossed the black wings and they flew behind Lu Ming, sinking into his back.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>On his back, the black wings spread out, making Lu Ming look as if he had grown a pair of wings out of thin air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flap of the black wings, Lu Ming’s figure disappeared from his original spot at an astonishing speed. Lu Ming circled the stone chamber dozens of times before returning to his original spot.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied with the black wings.</p><p>He had the black wings. If he combined them with the power of the wind elemental technique and the air-frozen bead, his speed would definitely be greatly increased.</p><p>At the same time, the black wings also had a strong offensive power. Moreover, the wings could cover the whole body and have a strong defensive ability.</p><p>This spirit weapon could be said to be one of the very few spirit weapons that had all the functions. If it was sold, the price would be more than ten times more expensive than other spirit weapons of the same level.</p><p>With a thought, the black wings retracted and disappeared into his skin.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked around. Other than the black wings and the passage in front of him, there was nothing else in the stone room.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and walked toward the passage.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>All of a sudden, a screech was heard. A huge black Goshawk appeared at the entrance of the passage and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. Of course, this Goshawk was not real. It was condensed from some kind of energy. Most importantly, it had appeared too suddenly.</p><p>Lu Ming subconsciously retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, he realized that the goshawk did not give chase. Instead, it hovered in the air and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young man, go back. Don’t continue forward, or there will be a great disaster!”</p><p>The goshawk suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it doesn’t matter who I am. Let’s go back. There’s no road ahead!</p><p>The goshawk spoke again.</p><p>“Great disaster? No way out? I don’t believe it. If I don’t try, how will I know there’s no way out?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>They had encountered so many obstacles along the way. How could Lu Ming be blocked by a Goshawk?</p><p>The goshawk seemed to sigh. It flapped its wings and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming activated his Chaos Domain and threw a punch.</p><p>The violent fist force crushed over, causing the stone room to rumble and shake.</p><p>“This is … The chaos Domain?”</p><p>The goshawk cried out in alarm. Then, it flapped its wings rapidly, and a terrifying Gale swept out.</p><p>The strong wind and Lu Ming’s fist force collided, creating a series of explosive sounds. In the end, the strong wind disappeared, and Lu Ming could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>Such powerful strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>“It seems that I have to use my full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>But at this moment, a change suddenly occurred.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p>It was a black shadow that was shrouded in black light. Its appearance could not be seen clearly. The moment it appeared, it pounced at the goshawk.</p><p>The black shadow and the goshawk were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>“Young man, I’ll hold him back. You can go over!”</p><p>An old voice came from the shadow. It sounded gentle and comfortable.</p><p>“Don’t go over, you have to hear me …”</p><p>The goshawk cried out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black shadow pounced on the goshawk and launched an even fiercer attack. The battle was intense.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>What was going on with the goshawk and the black shadow?</p><p>Was it the checkpoint of this place? Or was it a test?</p><p>Why did one of them let him go over, while the other didn’t?</p><p>perhaps it’s just a test. Pass!</p><p>Lu Ming made a decision.</p><p>Since they were already here, Lu Ming could not possibly give up and leave just because of a few words from a Goshawk.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He activated the wind elemental technique and the energy of the air-frozen bead gushed into the air. Lu Ming took advantage of the gap between the goshawk and the black shadow to dash into the passage and disappear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The goshawk and the black shadow exchanged a blow and both retreated.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>The goshawk sighed as it watched Lu Ming leave.</p><p>hehe, Emperor Cang, you want to stop them? impossible. In the end, you have lost this round.</p><p>A cold and ear-piercing laughter came from the black shadow, which was completely different from the gentle voice just now.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could no longer hear these words.</p><p>He followed the passageway and advanced. Soon, light appeared in front of him. He had reached the end of the passageway.</p><p>Clang! BOOM!</p><p>In front of him, there was a violent roar and the sound of metal clashing.</p><p>Someone was fighting!</p><p>Lu Ming slowed down and dashed through the entrance of the passageway.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed out, he saw a small black Flag flying toward him. Demonic Qi was rolling on the small flag.</p><p>“It’s an Emperor spiritual weapon without an owner!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, an overbearing roar came from the front. A huge palm formed entirely of demonic Qi grabbed at Lu Ming and the small flag.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He threw a punch and the huge palm exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the small black Flag.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to stop me!”</p><p>An overbearing voice rang out.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, a young man was staring at him coldly. The demonic aura around him was monstrous.</p><p>“This place is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept past the young man, then he looked elsewhere.</p><p>This was a huge Hall that was extremely wide. In the void, there were many rays of treasure light dancing. Within them, there were many young men chasing after these treasure lights.</p><p>Emperor spiritual weapons and even holy weapons!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>Most of the lights dancing in the air were Emperor spiritual weapons. There were hundreds of them, and there were even Saint weapons and elixirs.</p><p>There were about a dozen young men flying around, chasing after these treasures. From time to time, they would get into a fight over the treasures.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed that these young men were all at the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a few familiar faces among them.</p><p>He Yu, the leader of Dragon God Valley, Wang Xiao, the leader of jiuxiao sword sect, Shi Tian, the leader of tianshen sect, Luo Xiang, the leader of life-and-death Sword sect …</p><p>They were all the leaders of the various sects who had entered this place.</p><p>Indeed, those who could make it this far were all extremely powerful people.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to ignore me?”</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, the young man with surging demonic Qi had a cold look in his eyes. He pointed a finger at Lu Ming.</p><p>A black finger, like the finger of a Demon God, pierced through the void and pointed at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>If he was hit, Lu Ming would definitely die.</p><p>What a domineering person, taking people’s lives.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned cold and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch collided with the other party’s finger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
