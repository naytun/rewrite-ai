We shouldn’t provoke him in the great emperor secret realm for the time being. When my cultivation improves, I’ll be 100% confident!</p><p>He Yu said and then strode forward.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming watched as he Yu and the rest left, not pursuing them.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of he Yu, but he was afraid of causing more trouble.</p><p>Right now, Qiu Ying Ying was trying her best to receive the inheritance. If he were to fight with he Yu, the commotion would be too great, and it would probably affect Qiu Ying Ying’s inheritance.</p><p>Seeing that he Yu and the rest had left, the rest of the spectators did not dare to stay any longer. They all ran away and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Only Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao and Lu Ming were left in the hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have saved us again! Many thanks!”</p><p>Qiu Hao walked to Lu Ming’s side and cupped his fists at him. His eyes were filled with gratitude.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had saved the siblings many times. Otherwise, they did not know what the consequences would be.</p><p>Naturally, he was extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. you don’t have to be so polite. We’re friends, aren’t we? ” Since I’ve encountered it, do you expect me to just stand by and do nothing?”</p><p>Lu Ming said it casually, but Qiu Hao was even more grateful.</p><p>by the way, Lu Ming, I got two holy weapons here. You can take this shield! Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Hao passed the shield to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Qiu, this is your chance, why are you giving it to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled.</p><p>Although holy weapons were very precious, to be honest, Lu Ming was very tempted.</p><p>However, this was Qiu Hao’s opportunity and Lu Ming would not take it away from him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to keep these two holy weapons. The Golden Bell is very compatible with me, but the shield isn’t. Perhaps it’s more suitable for you!”</p><p>Qiu Hao insisted on giving the shield to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to take the shield.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>As he took the shield, he felt his palm sink slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the Dragon God combat body and was extremely powerful. However, he still felt that the shield was a little heavy. Its weight was shocking.</p><p>The shield exuded a mysterious wave, which was similar to the air-frozen bead and the lightning cauldron that Lu Ming had obtained.</p><p>“A holy weapon Shield is definitely a rare treasure!”</p><p>Lu Ming also liked it a little. This shield was priceless in the outside world.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Qiu Hao sat cross-legged on Qiu Ying Ying’s left and right, and began to refine their own Saint weapons.</p><p>Zhen Yuan poured into the shield. The shield hummed and emitted a buzzing sound.</p><p>Not long after, the shield shrunk rapidly and flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>The shield could already be considered to be at the initial stage of refinement.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible for Lu Ming to completely refine it now and he could not unleash the full power of the shield.</p><p>This was a holy weapon!</p><p>Just like the lightning cauldron, Lu Ming had been in possession of it for many years but he could only unleash a small portion of its power.</p><p>The difference in their cultivation levels was too great.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and realized that Qiu Hao was still refining the Golden Bell.</p><p>The Golden Bell hovered above Qiu Hao’s head and shone with a bright light that enveloped him. After a while, the Golden Bell turned into a ray of golden light and disappeared into Qiu Hao’s forehead.</p><p>He had also completed the initial refinement.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Ying Ying’s body emitted a strong wave of energy.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he was facing a Sage when he sensed the fluctuation. The terrifying pressure made him feel suffocated.</p><p>But this fluctuation, the moment it was released, it quickly converged into Qiu Ying Ying’s body and disappeared. At this time, Qiu Ying Ying opened her eyes.</p><p>“Yingying, did you succeed?”</p><p>Qiu Hao looked at Qiu Ying Ying expectantly.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying nodded, and Qiu Hao was overjoyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, although she was receiving the legacy, she still had a vague sense of what was happening in the outside world. She knew that Lu Ming had saved them. Otherwise, Qiu Ying Ying would not have received the legacy. It would be considered good if she could even keep her life.</p><p>you’re welcome, Yingying. Why were you suddenly brought in earlier? what’s going on? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“It’s that Jade token. I obtained it by accident when I first entered the great sovereign secret realm. I didn’t know what it was for, so I kept it with me. I didn’t expect it to be the key to the inheritance here. I obtained the inheritance with this Jade token.”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. This was an opportunity.</p><p>Yingying, did you get any useful information from the inheritance? ”</p><p>Qiu Hao asked curiously.</p><p>I haven’t fully digested the inheritance yet. I’ve only just received it, so I don’t know much. I only know that this is the inheritance of an absolute Saint senior.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Absolute Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Hao were shocked.</p><p>An absolute Saint was an existence that was close to a great emperor. For Qiu Ying Ying to actually obtain the inheritance of an absolute Saint, the two of them were happy for Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>however, in the inheritance, I did obtain an important piece of information regarding Emperor Cang.</p><p>it’s said that the seven inheritances will appear. When the seven rainbow bridges break through the void, Emperor Cang’s bedroom will appear!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Seven different inheritances? Yingying, you’re one of them, but what do you mean by seven rainbow bridges?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying also shook her head, indicating that she did not know.</p><p>let’s go, we’ll go out first. I’m afraid the other places have already been searched!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the three of them went out. After going around here and there, the three of them left the fortress.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the three of them left the fortress, the entire fortress trembled violently and a bright light shone.</p><p>In the end, under everyone’s shocked gazes, the light gathered on the fortress and formed a massive rainbow that pierced through the air, extending to an unknown place and disappearing into the vast sky.</p><p>“Rainbow Bridge, this is the Rainbow Bridge!”</p><p>Qiu Hao exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Rainbow Bridge. Now, they understood.</p><p>It seemed that there were seven kinds of inheritances in this secret realm. Whenever someone obtained an inheritance, a Rainbow Bridge would be activated, leading to the depths of the void.</p><p>Emperor Cang’s bedroom would only appear when the seven rainbow bridges converged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The fortress trembled, causing many of the young men in the fortress to fly out. They looked up at the sky, at the Rainbow Bridge, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people looked at each other.</p><p>“Let’s go and find the next inheritance!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>They naturally wouldn’t explain it to the others.</p><p>The three of them soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Not long after they flew out, a rainbow light suddenly broke into the void in the distant sky.</p><p>Rainbow Bridge, another rainbow Bridge.</p><p>It was obvious that someone had already obtained the inheritance.</p><p>One end of the two rainbow bridges broke into the void, and they were heading in the same direction.</p><p>Not long after, the secret of the Rainbow Bridge was finally revealed. With an extremely fast speed, it spread throughout the entire Mystic realm, causing everyone’s hearts to burn with excitement.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
