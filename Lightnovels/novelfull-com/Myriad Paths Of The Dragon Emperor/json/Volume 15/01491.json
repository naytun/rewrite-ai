His name is elder mo hun. According to him, he was severely injured 80000 years ago and has yet to recover. Otherwise, I would have been in danger!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it must have been 80000 years ago. Sigh, I didn’t expect evil spirit to still have remnants. In addition to that, you met Dharma King annihilating soul in the great emperor secret realm. Is evil spirit religion going to rise again? ”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sighed as his expression became more and more solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. Why did everyone look so shocked when they heard the name evil spirit? even the master of Silver Dragon Valley looked frightened.</p><p>Even someone as strong as his master had such a grave expression.</p><p>“Master, what kind of force is evil spirit? What kind of force was it? Is he very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions out of curiosity.</p><p>“Strong, of course he’s strong. If he was at his peak, he could easily destroy the entire Azure continent!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said solemnly.</p><p>“He can easily destroy the entire Azure continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Azure continent was home to thirteen top-tier sects, each of which had unfathomable power.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming could not tell how powerful the Dragon God Valley was or how many powerhouses were hidden in the depths of the vast Snow Mountain.</p><p>With so many powerful forces, evil spirit could easily destroy them.</p><p>the peak of the evil spirit cult was 80000 years ago. At that time, the evil spirit cult was extremely powerful. The evil spirit cult was the most famous. They had a cult leader and two Deputy cult leaders. They were all the peak experts of the yuan continent!</p><p>in addition, there are thirty-six Guardian Kings and three hundred and sixty elders. Their strength can be said to be terrifying to the extreme!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master explained.</p><p>“Thirty-six Guardian Kings?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He thought of Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>“Master, could it be that The Guardian Kings are all great emperor experts?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his voice was a little dry.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>yes! the origin Dragon Valley master nodded. the evil spirit sect has thirty-six Guardian Kings, all of whom are peerless experts at the great emperor level. The three hundred and sixty elders are all powerful existences in the Saint realm!</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>Evil Spirit’s strength far exceeded his imagination.</p><p>There were actually thirty-six great emperor level Guardian Kings, as well as a sect leader and two vice sect leaders. This kind of strength was truly terrifying to the extreme. Destroying the Azure continent would be as easy as turning over his hand.</p><p>Did he actually offend such a powerful force?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly!</p><p>the key is that the evil spirit cult was born in a very mysterious way. It seemed to have appeared out of thin air. Then, the experts in the evil spirit cult also seemed to have appeared out of thin air. Their power expanded rapidly and shook the entire Yuan continent!</p><p>moreover, evil spirit has a terrifying goal. Their goal is to kill other great emperors and those peerless geniuses who have the potential to become great emperors. 80000 years ago, they caused a storm of blood in the yuan continent!</p><p>The valley master said.</p><p>“Specifically hunting great emperors and peerless geniuses with the potential to become great emperors?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled, but he was puzzled.”Master, why did evil spirit do this?”</p><p>I don’t know. No one knows why evil spirit is doing this. Perhaps some great emperor-level figures know, but they just haven’t announced it!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master shook his head and said, ” thus, evil spirit caused all the forces in Yuan continent to panic. In the end, countless forces, big and small, joined forces to besiege evil spirit. According to the records, that battle was extremely tragic. Countless Saints died in battle, even many emperors. But in the end, evil spirit was completely annihilated and disappeared from the world.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent for a long time after hearing the cloud Dragon Valley Master’s words.</p><p>Evil spirit was definitely a terrifying force.</p><p>They specifically killed great emperors and those with great emperor potential.</p><p>He finally knew why so many people were so frightened when they heard the name of evil spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of many things. He was reminded of his encounter in the Emperor Cang Mystic realm.</p><p>Emperor Cang had disappeared sixty thousand years ago. The truth was that Shakyamuni annihilating soul had entered the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm. Judging from the time, evil spirit cult had already been exterminated. However, it was obvious that Shakyamuni annihilating soul did not die. He had entered the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm and fought against Emperor Cang for sixty thousand years.</p><p>Since Shakyamuni annihilating soul was not dead and elder mo hun had also survived, did evil spirit cult have any other experts who had survived?</p><p>After 80,000 years, would evil spirit be revived?</p><p>A wisp of elder mo Hun’s soul escaped and told Lu Ming to wait for evil Spirit’s revenge. Was evil spirit going to reappear in the world again?</p><p>Lu Ming felt a strong pressure on his body.</p><p>It would be strange if he didn’t feel any pressure when facing such a terrifying force.</p><p>Ming ‘er, go back and cultivate. I’ll report the matter of evil spirit to the valley master and have him inform the other sects for a discussion!</p><p>Finally, the cloud Dragon Valley master instructed.</p><p>“Disciple will take his leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left the cloud Dragon Valley master’s cave abode, returning to his own cave abode.</p><p>After returning to his cave abode, Lu Ming meditated to regulate his breathing. He then took out a pile of raw gemstones and began to devour and refine them.</p><p>Now that his Chaos Domain had broken through to level three, as long as he continued to refine the raw gemstones, his cultivation would improve.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming cultivated in seclusion and refined the rough stone. His cultivation level was improving by leaps and bounds.</p><p>From the early stage of the second level Martial Emperor realm to the middle stage of the second level Martial Emperor realm, then the late stage, the peak …</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming’s cultivation broke through and entered the third level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally stopped devouring the refined raw stone.</p><p>Next, he should focus on comprehending the chaos Domain.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to waste any time. In the yuan continent, he really felt that his cultivation level was too low.</p><p>He had to improve his cultivation as soon as possible.</p><p>However, comprehending the chaos Domain wasn’t something that could be done overnight. He first had to go to the treasure Dragon Palace to exchange for some treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming left the cave abode and headed for the treasure Dragon Hall. Soon, he arrived at the treasure Dragon Hall and went to the counter where he exchanged for the myriad spirit liquid and dragon bones.</p><p>“Senior, do you still remember me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and greeted him.</p><p>“It’s you? Little fellow, are you here to exchange for treasures again?”</p><p>The old man at the counter said with a smile. He had a deep impression of Lu Ming. After all, not every first level Martial Emperor could have two million contribution points.</p><p>“Senior, I need to exchange some treasures for contribution points first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, let’s take a look!”</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming passed a storage ring to the old man.</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan and raised his eyebrows. you’re amazing, little guy. A Sword Saint weapon and five King spiritual weapons!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded.</p><p>The bright Saint weapons and Emperor spiritual weapons in the storage ring were all from mo he’s storage ring. They were of no use to Lu Ming. He might as well exchange them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
