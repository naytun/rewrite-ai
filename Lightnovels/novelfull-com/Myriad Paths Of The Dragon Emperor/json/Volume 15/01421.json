They should be at the Emperor level, but the storage rings were all gone. Lu Ming found nothing.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming walked along the passageway and finally came to a secret room. There were a few boxes in the secret room.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he opened one of the boxes.</p><p>Inside, there were some refining materials.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was overjoyed when he took a closer look.</p><p>This was because these materials were too precious. They could all be used to refine Saint weapons. If they were taken out, they would be worth cities.</p><p>He had finally found something good. Lu Ming smiled and kept the box of refining materials into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming opened the second big box. The second box also contained refining materials. They were all very precious refining materials for refining holy weapons.</p><p>After Lu Ming kept it, he looked at the third box.</p><p>There were only three boxes in total.</p><p>The third box was the smallest.</p><p>“Could it be that they are all forging materials?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He then opened the box. As soon as the box was opened, a strange fluctuation spread out.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>This fluctuation was extremely mysterious. It was like the aura of the heavenly Dao. It was extremely similar to the aura emitted by the heavenly Dao engraving that Lu Ming had seen in the ancient cave mansion.</p><p>This was the aura of the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the box.</p><p>Inside the box were pieces of chaotic-colored stones. Each of them was about the size of a fist, and there were about a hundred of them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He seemed to have thought of something and he looked surprised.</p><p>“Could this be the heavenly Dao stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was thumping.</p><p>The heavenly Dao stone, as its name suggested, contained the aura of the heavenly Dao. It was said that it was born from chaos at the beginning of the world. It contained the great Dao and was extremely precious.</p><p>Martial Royal realm experts could use the heavenly Dao stone to comprehend and upgrade their domains.</p><p>Even sages could use the heavenly Dao stone to comprehend the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p>However, there were too few heavenly Dao stones. They were born at the beginning of the world, so there were very few of them. Moreover, with every piece used, there would be one less. Over the years, the number of heavenly Dao stones had been decreasing, and their prices had also become more and more precious.</p><p>we’re rich, we’re rich! There are so many heavenly Dao stones here!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>There were 108 pieces in total.</p><p>my Primal Chaos Domain is extremely difficult to cultivate and extremely slow to improve. It’s far inferior to other domains. However, with the heavenly Dao stone, my speed won’t be surpassed by others by too much!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>The chaos realm, the Emperor of thousands of realms, was powerful, but it had a disadvantage. It was too difficult to cultivate.</p><p>However, with the heavenly Dao stone, Lu Ming’s comprehension speed would definitely be greatly accelerated.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the heavenly Dao stone in a storage ring. He was afraid that it would be ruined by dandan if he kept it in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After keeping the heavenly Dao stone, Lu Ming left the place and continued to move forward.</p><p>Not long after, there was light ahead, and at the same time, a burst of medicinal fragrance filled the air.</p><p>The smell of herbs, there were spirit herbs!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he strode forward.</p><p>As expected, there was a herb garden in front of Lu Ming. The strong herbal fragrance was rushing into Lu Ming’s nose.</p><p>so many spiritual herbs. This is the thousand opportunity fruit, and the Jade Snow Lotus …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room, and there was a burning glow in his eyes.</p><p>At a glance, they were at least level nine spiritual herbs. Lu Ming could tell that a few of them were half-divine herbs.</p><p>A half-Saint herb would become a saint herb if it advanced one step further.</p><p>Lu Ming had once bought a half-divine medicine that was losing its spirituality and planted it next to the path-understanding ancient tree. Now, it had completely recovered its original Qi.</p><p>However, there were at least seven half-Saint herbs here.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming looked ahead.</p><p>It was a one-meter-tall, crystal-clear tree with brilliant lights and vibrant colors. It had a magical energy fluctuation.</p><p>“Heaven liquid ancient tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with ecstasy.</p><p>This was a Saint herb, a true Saint herb. Even a Saint would break his head if he saw it.</p><p>Every once in a while, a type of spiritual liquid would be produced on the branches and leaves of the heaven liquid ancient tree. It was called heaven liquid, and its value was immeasurable. Its effects were even greater than the water of life.</p><p>Be it recovering true essence or healing injuries, it was extremely effective.</p><p>There was a skeleton half-squatting beside the heaven liquid ancient tree. It held a Jade bottle in its hand and seemed to be collecting the heaven liquid from the ancient tree.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and picked up the Jade bottle. Indeed, there was half a bottle of heavenly liquid on the Jade Screen.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Then, he moved in a flash and put away all the level-nine spiritual herbs and the half-divine herbs.</p><p>Finally, he uprooted the sky liquid ancient tree and planned to plant it in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After keeping the spiritual herbs, Lu Ming had an idea and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>First, Lu Ming went to the second body.</p><p>After a few months of recuperation and the help of a bottle of premium life potion, the second body had finally recovered from the explosion. However, his original Qi had not fully recovered and he needed to rest.</p><p>Lu Ming took out half a bottle of heavenly liquid, took it, and finished it in one gulp. He then closed his eyes and continued to cultivate.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took a step forward and came to the place where dandan and bubbles were.</p><p>The valley was originally filled with spirit herbs, but now, almost all of them had been eaten up. Dandan and bubbles were sleeping soundly.</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s arrival, dandan opened her eyes in a daze and said, ” “Lu Ming, do you have any more spirit herbs? give me some more. I’m about to recover!”</p><p>“Take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than a hundred Supreme-grade level-nine spiritual herbs flew out.</p><p>Every single one of these spiritual herbs was at the Supreme grade of level 9. Furthermore, they had been nurtured in the herb garden for at least 60000 years. Their medicinal strength was astonishing, far exceeding that of ordinary Supreme grade level 9 spiritual herbs.</p><p>so many level-nine spiritual herbs. Boy, it seems that you have encountered another fortuitous encounter!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up as she grabbed two and stuffed them into her mouth.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>A white light flashed and bubbles woke up. She grabbed a few spirit herbs and started gnawing.</p><p>“With these spirit herbs, you guys should be able to recover, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his heart secretly aching. If he were to sell these spiritual herbs, he would definitely be able to sell them for a lot of rough stones.</p><p>well, with these spiritual herbs, it’s almost time. If there are more, I can even advance!</p><p>Dandan muttered, stuffing spiritual medicine into her mouth as she spoke.</p><p>“Oh, then I’ll give you these too!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the seven half-divine herbs.</p><p>If dandan and bubbles were to advance, it would be of great help to him, so he was naturally willing to part with them.</p><p>nest, this is a half-Saint medicine. And seven …</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up. She leaped on all fours and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a flash of white light and a bubble appeared. It kicked dandan away and appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder. It swallowed a half-divine medicine in one gulp.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
