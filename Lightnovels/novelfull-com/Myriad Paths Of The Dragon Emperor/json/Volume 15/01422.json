She gritted her teeth and glared at the bubble fiercely.</p><p>...</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles burped, blinked her big black eyes, and looked at dandan innocently, making dandan so angry that she almost vomited blood.</p><p>come, there are six half-Saint herbs here. Each of you will get three!</p><p>Lu Ming gave the six half-divine herbs to dandan and bubbles.</p><p>“That’s not fair! Why do I only have three while this little guy has four!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>f * ck, how old are you? aren’t you embarrassed to be so serious with bubbles? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of disdain.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles took the three half-divine herbs and stuffed them into her mouth, snuggling in Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>Dandan’s face turned green with anger. She took the three half-Saint herbs with hatred and ran away.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the heaven liquid ancient tree.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he took out the heaven liquid ancient tree, dandan instantly rushed over again. Her eyes were wide open as she said,”Nest, sacred medicine, a true sacred medicine!”</p><p>hey, this is the heaven elixir fruit tree. It’s different from other sacred medicines. It’s a waste to swallow it directly. If you dare to touch it, I’ll cook you!</p><p>Lu Ming stared at dandan and said.</p><p>He was just a little afraid that this fellow would swallow the heavenly liquid ancient tree while he was not around.</p><p>“Haha, why would I? Who am I? Moreover, the heaven liquid of the heaven liquid ancient tree is priceless. I know that there’s no effect in directly swallowing it. ”</p><p>Dandan smiled brightly, but her sneaky eyes still glanced at the heaven liquid ancient tree from time to time.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with dandan. He found a place and planted the heavenly liquid ancient tree.</p><p>Lu Ming then exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>this place is definitely the bedroom of an expert. Even if it’s not a great emperor, it’s still very impressive. Let’s look for it again!</p><p>Lu Ming left the herb garden and walked along the passageway. Soon, he saw many forked passageways. He chose one at random and searched for treasures in the fortress.</p><p>During this time, he saw many skeletons. The bone armor was sparkling and translucent. They were all the bone armor of emperors. However, the strange thing was that these bone armor were completely undamaged. It didn’t seem like they had experienced a great battle when they were alive. He didn’t know how they had died.</p><p>Furthermore, he did not see a single storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming explored along the way and gradually approached the center of the fortress.</p><p>At the center of the fortress was a large hall, where an intense battle was taking place.</p><p>More than a dozen young men and women surrounded the two of them.</p><p>The two people who were surrounded were Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Ying Ying was sitting cross-legged, and her body was covered with a layer of holy light. She looked solemn, as if she had fallen into a kind of ethereal state.</p><p>As for Qiu Hao, he held a shield in his hand and a Golden Bell floated above his head. Both the shield and the Golden Bell emitted rays of light and a mysterious aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two sword radiances, one from the left and the other from the right, pierced towards Qiu Hao at lightning speed and with shocking power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden Bell above Qiu Hao’s head buzzed and two rays of light scattered down, destroying the two sword rays.</p><p>“A holy weapon is indeed powerful!”</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s attack together. The woman has obtained the inheritance of the expert here, and the man has two powerful Saint weapons. One or two of us won’t be able to take him down!”</p><p>A red-faced young man said.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>All of them were at Lv 1 martial Royal realm. Qiu Hao’s face turned serious when he sensed their auras.</p><p>“Brat, you’d better hand over your Saint weapon. You can’t swallow such a treasure. Also, break that woman’s inheritance and make her hand over her inheritance!”</p><p>The red-faced young man said coldly as he looked at Qiu Ying Ying with greed in his eyes.</p><p>This woman’s luck was too good. She had actually obtained the inheritance of this place.</p><p>The owner of this place was definitely an extraordinary expert. Who would not want the inheritance of such an expert?</p><p>don’t even think about it. If you want to interrupt my sister’s inheritance, she will be seriously injured or even killed. If you want to interrupt her, you will have to step over my dead body!</p><p>Qiu Hao bellowed as he held his shield and the Golden Bell above his head buzzed.</p><p>“Hmph, kid, don’t think you’re all that just because you have two Saint weapons. You’ve just obtained them and haven’t refined them yet. Besides, how much power can you use with your cultivation? You can’t stop us!”</p><p>The red-faced young man sneered.</p><p>“Let’s see who dares to touch the people of Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from a passage on the side of the hall.</p><p>Then, with a flash, a group of people appeared in the hall. There were more than twenty people.</p><p>Each of them released their aura. They were all martial emperors.</p><p>Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Qiu Hao’s eyes lit up and he quickly shouted, ” “Senior brothers, save us!”</p><p>“So it’s you guys!”</p><p>A chuckle came from the crowd of Dragon God Valley, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>This person was wearing a silver robe and had a cold and arrogant expression. Who else could it be but Yin Feng?</p><p>“Yinfeng!”</p><p>Qiu Hao’s expression changed.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Yin Feng strode out, and the other young men and women present had ugly expressions.</p><p>It would be difficult to deal with so many people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>the treasures and inheritance here were discovered by all of us. Your Dragon God Valley wants to take it all for yourself? aren’t you too greedy? ”</p><p>The red-faced young man said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Inheritance? A treasure?”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes swept across Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao, and he immediately understood what was going on. A hint of greed flashed across his eyes.</p><p>“The two of you are quite lucky. One of you obtained an inheritance, and the other obtained a Saint weapon. Now, hand over your Saint weapon!”</p><p>Yin Feng said.</p><p>“Leave it to you?”</p><p>Qiu Hao’s expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right, leave it to me. You take it, can you keep it? Also, immediately interrupt your sister’s inheritance. How can she be qualified to accept the inheritance of such a powerful expert?”</p><p>Yin Feng said with slight disdain.</p><p>no, I can give you my treasures, but I can’t interrupt Yingying’s inheritance!</p><p>Qiu Hao gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Can’t?”</p><p>“If you don’t want to hand it over, then you’ll have to deal with this on your own!” Yin Feng’s face turned cold.</p><p>Yin Feng sneered and walked to the side with the other disciples of the Dragon God Valley as if it was none of their business.</p><p>“You guys … The elder said before that the disciples of Dragon God Valley should unite and help each other. You are not helping them!”</p><p>Qiu Hao looked at the red-faced young man and the others warily and shouted at the disciples of Dragon God Valley at the same time.</p><p>“United? We will naturally be United, but you are just a lowly ant from a Savage Island. What qualifications do you have to be United with us? Furthermore, you want to take over the treasures and inheritance. What a joke!”</p><p>Yin Feng sneered.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, Yin Feng’s status seemed to be very high. The others looked at Qiu Hao and Qiu Yingying indifferently and had no intention of helping them.</p><p>The red-faced young man and the others ‘eyes lit up at the sight of this. They slowly approached Qiu Hao, and a dozen powerful auras pressed down on him, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
