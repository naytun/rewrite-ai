Wang Xiao howled in pain as he coughed up another mouthful of blood.</p><p>Just now, Wang Xiao and Shi Tian were the ones who were the most arrogant. Lu Ming decided to just focus on one of them and torture him until he was scared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming picked up Wang Xiao and smashed him down on the mountain peak.</p><p>The mountain peak shook, and gravel flew everywhere. A large piece of the huge mountain peak was shattered.</p><p>When Shi Tian, mojie, and the rest were about to attack, Lu Ming lifted Wang Xiao and attacked them.</p><p>Currently, Wang Xiao was covered by the armour, and was like a sledgehammer. It was easy to use him.</p><p>In the distance, the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Wang Xiao was the leader of the jiuxiao sword sect’s expedition into the great emperor secret realm. But now, he was in such a miserable state. He could not resist Lu Ming’s attack and was completely suppressed by him. He was being smashed by Lu Ming like a hammer.</p><p>Wang Xiao himself even felt like dying.</p><p>He had lost all his face.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Right at this moment, the heavens and earth began to shake violently.</p><p>Furthermore, the shaking was getting more and more intense, as if the entire world was shaking.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, the ground cracked open, and lava that was thousands of feet high rushed out.</p><p>“Not good, this secret realm is going to collapse!”</p><p>One figure after another rushed into the sky, and someone shouted.</p><p>“Maybe it’s because Emperor Cang’s chamber flew away!”</p><p>“What do we do? If the secret realm collapses, we’ll all die Here!”</p><p>The scene was noisy, and someone shouted in fear.</p><p>let’s fly up. When we first entered this secret realm, it looked like a bubble. There must be an end to it in the sky. Let’s fly up and get out of here!</p><p>“Yes, up!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Beams of light flew into the depths of the sky.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>In the sky, the space suddenly cracked open, revealing a pitch-black spatial crack. A few young men screamed as they were swallowed by the space.</p><p>If it was in the continent group of the divine Ruins, martial emperors would be fine if they entered the dark void. However, it was different here. The space was stable, but correspondingly, the power of spatial cracks was even more shocking. If a Martial Emperor entered, he would definitely die.</p><p>the space is about to crack. Be careful of spatial cracks!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>One figure after another flew up at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Shi Tian, mojie, and the rest had ugly expressions. They could not be bothered with Lu Ming and flew up into the sky to escape.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw Wang Xiao into a crack in the ground and into the lava. Then, he flapped his black wings and soared into the sky. In a few breaths, Lu Ming appeared beside Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, and ruan Tian.</p><p>“I’ll take you guys and charge together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His Chaos Domain enveloped Qiu Ying Ying and the rest. He then flapped his black wings and shot into the sky like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The world was shaking more and more violently. Below, the earth cracked open and lava wreaked havoc. It was a scene of doomsday.</p><p>In the sky, streaks of rainbow light flew into the sky.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of miles, they finally saw a light screen.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>Someone rushed into the light curtain, and the light curtain trembled and disappeared.</p><p>“It’s really possible!”</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed and rushed into the light screen.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that mojie, he Yu, Shi Tian, and the others had all rushed into the light screen.</p><p>After that, the others did the same.</p><p>“Yingying, you guys go out first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying asked.</p><p>“Kill a person!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He then waved his hand and sent Qiu Ying Ying and the rest into the light screen, disappearing.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked down diagonally.</p><p>There, a sword light was flying up at an extreme speed.</p><p>It was Wang Xiao.</p><p>He had been beaten half to death by Lu Ming and thrown into the lava. If not for his holy weapon armor, he would have been burned to death.</p><p>He finally managed to rush out and escape to the sky. However, this way, he was at the back.</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, coupled with the wind elemental technique, Lu Ming’s figure turned into a black light and he flew down.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Wang Xiao flew with all his might. The secret realm was crumbling more and more, and if he was one step slower, he would not be able to break out.</p><p>At the same time, he kept roaring in his heart. In his mind, he was planning how to take revenge on Lu Ming crazily after he got out.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw a black light flash and pounce towards him at extreme speed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared.</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed coldly as he looked down from above. He continued to use the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, and the power of his nine steps merged into one, forming a huge footprint that stomped down on Wang Xiao.</p><p>Wang Xiao bellowed in rage as he slashed out with his sword. The sword-light landed on Lu Ming’s footprint, breaking it apart. However, Wang Xiao’s body was still sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming once again chased after Wang Xiao.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re crazy. Do you want to die?”</p><p>Wang Xiao howled in fear.</p><p>He had a holy weapon and armor that could block Lu Ming’s attack. However, if he could not get out of the secret realm before it collapsed, even the Holy weapon and armor would not be able to save his life.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming swooped down, his black wings slashing out like blades.</p><p>A holy weapon armor appeared on Wang Xiao’s body, and with a sword in his hand, he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The combat sword struck the black wings, causing sparks to fly and the force to be unrestrained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was slightly blocked, but Wang Xiao’s body was like a cannonball, falling down.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the earth and sky were shaking even more violently. More and more spatial cracks appeared in the sky. The ground below was completely covered by lava.</p><p>This secret realm could collapse completely at any moment.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. He continued to charge at Wang Xiao.</p><p>madman, you’re a madman. Stop, stop!</p><p>Wang Xiao howled.</p><p>At this moment, he was really afraid. Lu Ming was a lunatic. In order to kill him, he would even throw away his own life.</p><p>If this continued, he and Lu Ming would both die Here.</p><p>It was good that Lu Ming was dead, but he did not want to die.</p><p>Now, he regretted it. He regretted provoking Lu Ming, this perverted lunatic.</p><p>“Humans have to pay the price for their actions!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He flapped his black wings and continued to slash at Wang Xiao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
