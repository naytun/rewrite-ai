Lightning flashed across the sky, eventually extinguishing the jet-black light.</p><p>“An absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul let out an angry roar.</p><p>“Good, a Thunder-attributed absolute Saint weapon is perfect to counter you, Shakyamuni annihilating soul. It seems like the heavens aren’t protecting you. In your current state, a Thunder-attributed absolute Saint weapon is more than enough to deal with you!”</p><p>Emperor Cang’s surprised voice rang out.</p><p>At the same time, Emperor Cang’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind, ” “Little brat, lend me your absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. With a single thought, the lightning cauldron flew forward.</p><p>Emperor Cang flapped one of his wings and the lightning cauldron flew towards him at an extreme speed. Furthermore, it rapidly grew in size until it was almost as big as Emperor Cang’s body. On top of it, there were endless flashes of lightning and it exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Is this the true power of the lightning cauldron?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened.</p><p>He now knew that the lightning cauldron was an absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>In the past, when it was in Lu Ming’s hands, the power it could unleash was simply a drop in the ocean. With Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he could not unleash much of the lightning cauldron’s power.</p><p>But now that the lightning cauldron was in Emperor Cang’s hands, it was completely different. Its power was completely unleashed and it was extremely shocking.</p><p>The huge Thunder cauldron pressed down on Shakyamuni annihilating soul, and countless Thunderbolts as thick as mountains kept bombarding him.</p><p>die! Shakyamuni annihilating soul roared. The black light on his body twisted and even emitted a sizzling sound.</p><p>The cultivation technique he cultivated was countered by lightning.</p><p>However, with his cultivation level, if he was at his peak, he wouldn’t even care about the lightning cauldron.</p><p>But now, he was extremely weak. The threat of the lightning cauldron was even greater. Furthermore, it was under the control of Emperor Cang.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The lightning cauldron slowly pressed down, completely drowning Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>“Emperor Cang, you can’t kill me. You can’t kill me with just an absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul roared.</p><p>“I just need to suppress you temporarily!”</p><p>Emperor Cang’s voice rang out.</p><p>Then, a voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears, ” little brat, I can’t return this lightning cauldron to you for now. However, as compensation, I’ll give you my storage ring!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>There was a flash of light and it shattered the void, appearing in front of Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>It was a storage ring, Emperor Cang’s storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to beat rapidly.</p><p>He grabbed the storage ring.</p><p>little brat, I’m going to take Shakyamuni annihilating soul and leave this place. I’ll use the power of the void to suppress him. You guys should leave quickly!</p><p>Emperor Cang’s voice rang out again. Then, Lu Ming felt a strong force pulling him and he disappeared from the starry sky.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in the void.</p><p>“I’m out!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the huge Goshawk in front of him. It was Emperor Cang’s bedroom. He had exited from it.</p><p>At this moment, the air around Lu Ming rippled and figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>Those who entered Emperor Cang’s bedchamber were all teleported out.</p><p>This included Shi Tian, Wang Xiao, and the others.</p><p>“Damn it, what’s going on?”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared.</p><p>They were blocked by the turtle shell Shield condensed by dandan and were about to break it, but at this time, they were inexplicably teleported out.</p><p>It was the same for the others. Some of them were extremely angry and unwilling to be teleported out just as they were about to get a treasure.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>At that moment, a long cry came from Emperor Cang’s bedchamber. Then, under everyone’s shocked gaze, it flapped its wings and flew into the depths of the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the depths of the sky, space cracked open as Emperor Cang’s bedroom flew into it, vanishing from sight.</p><p>“This is … What’s going on?”</p><p>“Why did Emperor Cang’s chamber suddenly fly away?”</p><p>“No, it’s my treasure!”</p><p>The scene was in a mess. Some people were roaring, while others were shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is it because of you?”</p><p>All of a sudden, a voice rang out and reverberated throughout the entire place. Many people quieted down and could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wang Xiao!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Wang Xiao.</p><p>The person who had shouted just now was none other than Wang Xiao.</p><p>Lu Ming, previously, you used despicable means to stop us. You were the only one who entered the core of Emperor Cang’s bedroom. Not long after you entered, we were teleported out and Emperor Cang’s bedroom flew away on its own. It must be because of you!</p><p>Wang Xiao said coldly.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming was the only one who entered the core of Emperor Cang’s chamber. He actually entered the core of Emperor Cang’s chamber?”</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with surprise and thought.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, did you obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance? is that why Emperor Cang’s bedroom flew away?”</p><p>Shi Tian stepped out, his body was filled with divine light, and he said coldly.</p><p>His words made most of the People’s eyes glow with a burning light. They fixed their gazes on Lu Ming.</p><p>The inheritance of a great emperor!</p><p>When they thought of these words, everyone’s heart burned with passion.</p><p>I didn’t obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“Haha, who would believe that? Lu Ming, you must have obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance. Now, hand over the inheritance. It’s impossible for you to keep it for yourself!”</p><p>Wang Xiao said.</p><p>“That’s right, the inheritance of the great emperor is not something you can swallow alone!”</p><p>Shi Tian followed.</p><p>that’s right. Hand over the inheritance. Otherwise, today will be the day you die!</p><p>it’s best to search his storage ring and his soul. Everything will be clear now, in case he hides anything!</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>The others followed suit and shouted. They stared at Lu Ming coldly and slowly formed a circle, surrounding Lu Ming in the middle.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Do you think that Dragon God Valley is weak? My fellow brothers, help Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the crowd, Qiu Ying Ying cried out.</p><p>“That’s right. Senior brothers, let’s help Lu Ming break out of this encirclement!”</p><p>Ruan Tian chimed in.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. This is a ‘personal grudge’ between Lu Ming and the other sects. Disciples of the Dragon God Valley, listen up. No one is allowed to help Lu Ming. Otherwise, if he offends the other sects because of his personal grudge and causes the Dragon God Valley to be on bad terms with the other sects, you will bear the responsibility!</p><p>Yin Feng shouted, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>When he found out that Lu Ming had actually entered the Emperor Cang core, he was extremely jealous and wished that Lu Ming would die.</p><p>that’s right. Disciples of Dragon God Valley, don’t move!</p><p>As he Yu spoke, his body moved and his powerful aura locked onto Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, ruan Tian and the others.</p><p>“You guys … You’re all despicable! The elders have already said that we should work together!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying called out.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>die! he Yu shouted coldly. His powerful aura pressed down on Qiu Ying Ying’s body, causing her to have difficulty breathing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
