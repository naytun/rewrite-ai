He actually didn’t die in the battle that year!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Could it be that dandan knew this figure?</p><p>“Dandan, you know him?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in a low voice.</p><p>He was now certain that the two giant pythons had retreated most likely because of this figure.</p><p>In the depths of this terrifying forbidden land, there was a mature path-understanding ancient tree. Under the path-understanding ancient tree, there was a towering figure sitting cross-legged. It was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Moreover, dandan seemed to know him.</p><p>“Nonsense, this King would recognize this guy even if he turned to dust!”</p><p>Dandan muttered, her face revealing an angry expression.</p><p>He wouldn’t be a match for this guy dandan, right? Dandan was one of the top ten war beasts, so how terrifying was this towering figure?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heartbeat accelerated!</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles chirped and looked at the figure curiously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the towering figure suddenly opened his eyes. Two bright rays of light shot out from his eyes like two extremely sharp divine swords, as if they were going to split the world in half.</p><p>The towering figure’s gaze first landed on bubbles, then on dandan, and finally on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure on his body when the gaze swept over him. He found it difficult to even breathe, as if his body had been penetrated.</p><p>“Strong, too strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming only had one thought in his mind.</p><p>The figure did not release any shocking aura. It merely swept its gaze across Lu Ming and Lu Ming could feel a terrifying pressure. It was as if he was facing the entire universe and he could not even think of resisting.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that the other party could turn him into ashes with a single thought.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying roar came from the void in the distance. It was filled with brutal intent.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted from the path-understanding ancient tree and the towering figure to the depths of the void.</p><p>There, a huge hole seemed to have been torn open in the space. A huge, pitch-black hole floated quietly in the air.</p><p>It was pitch black inside, as if it led to the abyss of hell.</p><p>And that terrifying roar had come from that abyss-like hole.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Following that, the roars came one after another, getting louder and louder, more and more shocking.</p><p>The sound turned into a terrifying sound wave and charged out, causing Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain to shake violently. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he was forced to retreat, almost spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>What a terrifying sound.</p><p>Lu Ming and the hole were separated by an unknown distance, yet the sound that came out of the hole could still injure Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the towering figure stood up.</p><p>As he stood up, his figure became even more majestic, as if he was as tall as the sky.</p><p>The towering figure flicked his finger and a ray of light flew toward Lu Ming and the others, forming a light screen that blocked them.</p><p>That terrifying sound immediately disappeared.</p><p>The towering figure was actually protecting them. It seemed that he really knew dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The roars shook the sky. At this moment, Lu Ming saw a shocking scene.</p><p>Two tentacles suddenly stretched out from the dark hole.</p><p>These two tentacles were extremely huge, like the tentacles of an octopus. They were pitch-black.</p><p>Two tentacles stretched out and pressed on both sides of the huge hole, supporting it with force, as if trying to let an even larger body behind it come out.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>break! the towering figure coldly spat out a word. The world rumbled as if the great path had been added to them. Two terrifying blades slashed at the two tentacles.</p><p>However, at this moment, two more black tentacles stretched out from the black hole and wrapped around the two blades. With two bangs, the two blades were destroyed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The towering figure stepped forward. His eyes were like lightning, and his body was surrounded by endless light. It was as if the great Dao of heaven and earth was surrounding him.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. What realm was this? the movement of the body and the movement of the great Dao was like the great Dao of heaven and earth. It was his weapon and his slave.</p><p>This level of cultivation was already unbelievable and had reached an unimaginable stage.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The towering figure punched out twice.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two pitch-black tentacles exploded, sending black liquid flying in all directions and scattering on the ground.</p><p>Within the black liquid, wisps of black mist were emitted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Could it be that the black fog and the black mud were formed by the explosion of these tentacles?</p><p>Roar!</p><p>&Nbsp; the tentacle was broken, and an angry roar came out of the pitch-black hole. The terrifying sound waves caused the space around the towering figure to collapse and turn into chaos.</p><p>The terrifying sound waves traversed an endless distance and rushed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. He felt his blood boiling and a stream of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Dandan, who was on Lu Ming’s shoulder, was sent flying.</p><p>f * ck! This guy is definitely doing this on purpose. Since he wants to protect us, why didn’t he isolate the sound waves completely? some of them even seeped in. This guy is doing this on purpose. He’s jealous of me!</p><p>Dandan shouted and glared at the towering figure in the distance.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>&Nbsp; roars came from the hole and a giant head appeared.</p><p>The head was covered in scales, and there were three eyes on the forehead.</p><p>Three eyes!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but recall the three-eyed God he had encountered on a small island in the heaven realm during the war of Providence.</p><p>The giant head appeared, and the third eye between its brows shot out a destructive light toward the towering figure. The towering figure punched out and destroyed the destructive light.</p><p>At this moment, a few more tentacles reached out from the hole and pressed around it. The huge figure seemed to be crawling out.</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p>The towering figure spoke, his voice rumbling. With a punch, heaven and earth were annihilated by the fist force.</p><p>&Nbsp; the tentacles pressing around the hole all exploded.</p><p>The black liquid scattered on the vast land. Some of it even sprayed toward Lu Ming and the rest. Fortunately, the towering figure had set up a light shield for them that blocked the black liquid. Otherwise, it would be a disaster for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the towering figure let out a loud roar and took a step forward, directly charging into the pitch-black hole.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom erupted from the pitch-black hole. The void collapsed and Lu Ming saw the scene inside through the collapsed void.</p><p>A massive figure covered in scales appeared, and it bore some resemblance to the three-eyed God race.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, it was far larger and more imposing than the three-eyed God race, and it had eight pitch-black tentacles growing from its back.</p><p>This figure held two giant axes and fought against the towering figure.</p><p>The towering figure, with the great path on his body, had astonishing combat power. The two of them kept clashing, and the void kept collapsing.</p><p>In the end, the two of them fought through the void and into the starry sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
