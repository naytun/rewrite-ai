Fortunately, he had an innate spiritual body and had now transformed into a low-grade earth spiritual body. He was very powerful and managed to save his life after a hole was pierced through his body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming charged at him again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s claw pierced through the white-robed young man’s territory and grabbed his neck. His essential core shook and almost scattered the young man’s essential core.</p><p>His true essence and domain naturally disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Help me …”</p><p>The white-robed youth screamed in fear as a dense black light shot towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming activated his Chaos Domain and enveloped the white-robed young man, blocking the black light.</p><p>The white-robed young man let out a long breath and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, let me go. My uncle is an elder of the tianshen sect. If you kill me, he …”</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>shut up! Lu Ming shouted coldly. His cold killing intent burst out, causing the white-robed young man to swallow his words.</p><p>“Speak, who asked you to come and kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Yes, yes …”</p><p>Just as the white-robed young man was about to reply, a voice sounded from the other side.</p><p>“You’d better let him go!”</p><p>A voice sounded, and a few young men walked out from the passage.</p><p>The young man in the lead had a slender figure and bright eyes. He was like a god with a very oppressive aura. The aura of the second level of the martial Royal realm emanated from his body.</p><p>There were two other young men behind the young man. They were both at the peak Lv 1 martial Royal realm. The black light could not do anything to them as they covered the area with their territory.</p><p>“That’s the leader of the heavenly God sect, Shi Tian!”</p><p>On the side, other people passed by and whispered. Then, they rushed forward and left this place.</p><p>“Senior Shi Tian, save me!”</p><p>The white-robed young man shouted in surprise when he saw Shi Tian.</p><p>“Kid, let me go, or brother Shi Tian will make you face a life and death situation!”</p><p>Following that, the white-robed young man berated Lu Ming and became arrogant again.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He carried the young man in the white coat and sent him out of the area covered by the territory. Immediately, his body was pierced by seven or eight rays of black light. Blood flowed out and he let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Such great courage!”</p><p>Behind Shi Tian, two young men shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Shi Tian stepped forward, his powerful aura pressing down on Lu Ming. He said coldly, ” “I said, let him go!”</p><p>His tone carried a sense of superiority as he ordered Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? Furthermore, this person has tried to sneak attack me time and time again. He’s already dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“If you kill him, I’ll kill you!” Shi Tian’s eyes were gloomy.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned ferocious, and the killing intent on his body became even colder.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The white-robed young man stood up in fear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power in Lu Ming’s hand suddenly exploded and drowned the white-robed young man. The young man was crushed into pieces by Lu Ming’s terrifying power.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, Shi Tian’s killing intent burst out. His body was bathed in the Holy Light. He took a step forward, and the void rumbled. Shi Tian raised his hand and pressed down. A huge Holy palm pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He stepped forward and struck out with his palm as well. A palm that was the color of chaos blasted out and clashed with his opponent.</p><p>The two palms collided and a bright light burst out. A vibration wave spread out and dispersed the black light around.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, Shi Tian’s divine palm print collapsed, and the chaos palm print continued to attack Shi Tian.</p><p>Shi Tian’s expression changed. The Holy Light on his body became even more brilliant, and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>“God’s spear of punishment!”</p><p>go! Shi Tian shouted. The divine spear cut through the void, as if it could penetrate everything in the world, and stabbed toward Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Shi Tian’s cultivation had reached the LV 2 martial Royal realm, and he had cultivated a medium-grade earth spiritual body. His combat strength was astonishing, and he was a heaven’s favorite on the same level as he Yu, Wang Xiao, and Luo Xiang.</p><p>He stood at the peak of all the heaven’s favorites who entered the secret realm.</p><p>Not many people could take this move of his.</p><p>But he met Lu Ming.</p><p>The chaos Domain covered the area. Lu Ming cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch. The shadow of the prison-suppressing stele flashed on his fist and it hit the tip of the Holy Spear directly.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A deafening sound was heard. The divine spear that Shi Tian thrust out was shaking violently. The terrifying power flowed along the spear and into Shi Tian’s arm, making his body shake.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, the divine spear exploded. Shi Tian’s body trembled and he retreated a few hundred meters, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The other two young men were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even Shi Tian’s combat strength was not Lu Ming’s match. How was this possible?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Shi Tian turned around and left without saying a word.</p><p>“Come and go as you please, how can it be that easy?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and activated the wind element technique, approaching Shi Tian in an instant.</p><p>The terrifying fist force was aimed at Shi Tian.</p><p>Shi Tian roared in anger and used all his strength to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>However, although he was strong, there was still a gap between him and Lu Ming. In less than ten moves, he was beaten to the point where he vomited blood.</p><p>“Senior Shi Tian, we will avenge you!”</p><p>The other young man was so scared that he left these words and ran away.</p><p>“Hehe, so these are your fellow disciples?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Shi Tian let out an angry roar and tried his best to resist.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain crushed him and he retreated.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch broke through Shi Tian’s defense and was about to kill him.</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura burst out from Shi Tian’s body. A shadow appeared on Shi Tian’s body, and an invisible force burst out.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. This energy was very similar to the light sword that Lu Ming had faced in the sword Pagoda.</p><p>It was a power of the same level.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flew backward from the impact of this force.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll definitely kill you next time!”</p><p>Shi Tian left these words and rushed into the depths of the tunnel.</p><p>“It turns out that Shi Tian has also obtained an inheritance!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Shi Tian must have also received an inheritance. Because he had just received the inheritance not long ago, he had not refined it yet. Therefore, this inheritance had the function of automatically protecting the owner.</p><p>After refining it, this function would disappear.</p><p>“Next time, if the inheritance can’t protect its master, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>There was a sharp glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying stepped forward and asked.</p><p>“I’m fine, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
