More than half of them would remain in the great emperor secret realm forever.</p><p>12,000 people. So far, apart from the cloud Dragon Valley, each of the other six Dragon valleys had more than 1000 people joining. Only the cloud Dragon Valley had no one.</p><p>Many people looked at each other. The cloud Dragon Valley was really a wonder.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had come personally, but he had not accepted a single disciple.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stepped forward and walked towards the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“This kid wants to join cloud Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley was the last place he wanted Lu Ming to join.</p><p>Given his status, he had connections in the other six Dragon valleys. If Lu Ming were to join him, he would have a hundred ways to kill him.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming were to join cloud Dragon Valley, it would be difficult.</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley master, that old fellow, has always taken in disciples based on his mood. I hope he doesn’t take Lu Ming in as a disciple!</p><p>Yin Feng thought to himself.</p><p>Many people around the square were also looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had a treasure like the Saint breakthrough pill on him. Naturally, he would attract a lot of attention.</p><p>“Senior, I’m lu Ming. I want to join cloud Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked in front of the cloud Dragon Valley master and bowed.</p><p>Joining Cloud Dragon Valley was Lu Ming’s final decision.</p><p>First of all, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s motto was to be free and unrestrained, like the clouds moving and relaxing. Lu Ming liked this very much.</p><p>Also, Longyuan mountain was also in Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Longyuan mountain was a good person and Lu Ming had a good impression of them.</p><p>Moreover, Longyuan mountain and cloud Dragon Valley master had helped Lu Ming one after another. That was why he chose to join cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>As for the fact that Cloud Dragon Valley was the weakest, he didn’t even consider it.</p><p>He had come to the yuan continent to cultivate.</p><p>As long as there was a stable environment for cultivation, it would be fine.</p><p>“Do you really want to join cloud Dragon Valley? Have you considered this carefully?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled slightly. Unlike the others, he did not directly refuse.</p><p>This made many people’s hearts skip a beat. Was the cloud Dragon Valley master going to take Lu Ming in?</p><p>“This junior has considered it carefully!”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>alright, welcome to Cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled and agreed.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re Lu Ming, right? Are you willing to take me as your master and become my ninth true disciple?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master spoke again.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master actually took the initiative to take Lu Ming as a direct disciple?</p><p>“This guy is really lucky!”</p><p>Yin Feng gritted his teeth.</p><p>If Lu Ming became the cloud Dragon Valley master’s direct disciple, it would be even more troublesome for him to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was famous for being protective of his own. His strength was so terrifying that even his grandfather, the silver Dragon Valley master, was afraid of him.</p><p>At the scene, the other young men looked at Lu Ming with envy.</p><p>To be accepted as a disciple by a Valley master, what kind of glory and opportunity was this?</p><p>Even though Cloud Dragon Valley was the weakest of the seven Dragon valleys, it was still the valley master with an unfathomable cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also stunned. He had not expected that the cloud Dragon Valley master would take him in as a personal disciple.</p><p>“Little guy, what do you think? If you’re not willing, this old master won’t force you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said gently.</p><p>“Disciple Lu Ming greets master!”</p><p>After pondering for a while, Lu Ming bowed.</p><p>He had just arrived in the yuan continent and he needed a backer. This would be of great help to his future cultivation.</p><p>“Good, hahaha!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the cloud Dragon Valley master laughed.</p><p>I don’t know what kind of luck this guy has to be accepted as a disciple by the cloud Dragon Valley master!</p><p>he’s just a lowly ant from a Savage Island. I don’t know what the cloud Dragon Valley master sees in him!</p><p>Some of the local young men were so envious that their eyes turned red, and they let out disdainful voices.</p><p>if your talent isn’t good enough, it’s useless even if you acknowledge a good master. You’ll still be trampled under the feet of others in the future! Someone said sourly.</p><p>Some people were unhappy, while others were happy.</p><p>Qiu Yingying, Qiu Hao, and the Ruan brothers were truly happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At that moment, the cloud Dragon Valley master stood up and scanned the crowd. this disciple of mine might have some treasures on him after entering the great Emperor’s Secret realm. That’s his chance. I don’t care if it’s a competition between peers, but if there’s an old man who dares to have designs on him, don’t blame me for being bad-tempered!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had always been gentle, but at that moment, a cold aura filled the air. The entire square was filled with a terrifying aura. Some of the peak martial emperors felt as if there was a huge stone in their chests, making it difficult for them to breathe.</p><p>“Saint breakthrough pill, forget it!”</p><p>Many people laughed bitterly in their hearts.</p><p>Before this, many people had coveted Lu Ming’s Saint breakthrough pill. However, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley was famous for being protective of his own people. Furthermore, his strength was shocking. Those who coveted the Saint breakthrough pill had put away their thoughts.</p><p>Compared to the Saint breakthrough pill, his own life was more important.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, no, ninth Junior Brother, congratulations! We’re going to be senior and junior brothers from now on!</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed.</p><p>“Greetings, senior brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted long Yuanshan.</p><p>“I’m master’s second disciple, you can just call me second senior brother!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go back to Cloud Dragon Valley!”</p><p>After cloud Dragon Valley master finished speaking, he stepped into the air and left.</p><p>The recruitment of disciples was not over yet. However, after the cloud Dragon Valley master had taken in Lu Ming as a legacy disciple, he clearly did not want to take in any more disciples and left immediately.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, let’s go to cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>Longyuan Shan grinned. He was extremely forthright. Then, he followed the cloud Dragon Valley master and left in the air. Lu Ming followed closely behind.</p><p>The direction they were walking in wasn’t the outer Valley, but the great snow Mountain in the depths.</p><p>As he walked in the air, the snow fluttered in the air. In front of him, there were many huge snow mountains rising from the ground. It was impossible to forget their ends.</p><p>it snows all year round in Dragon God Valley. It’s amazing. Legend has it that there’s a terrifying Ice Dragon sleeping in the depths of the great snow Mountain, which caused such a phenomenon. That terrifying Ice Dragon is the divine beast of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he recalled a legend.</p><p>Below him, he could see many snowy mountains.</p><p>Suddenly, a huge Glacier Valley appeared in front of them.</p><p>This Canyon was very strange. There were clouds in the sky, and snowflakes were falling from the clouds, making the entire Canyon look like a snow paradise.</p><p>Yuan Shan, take Ming ‘er and choose a cave to stay in. Ming’ er must be tired after entering the great emperor secret realm. Let’s rest first!</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley master ordered Longyuan mountain before flying into the depths of the glacier Valley and disappearing without a trace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
