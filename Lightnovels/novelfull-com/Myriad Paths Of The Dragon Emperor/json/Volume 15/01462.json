He even sneered and said, ” “Junior Brother Lu Ming, you’ve just entered Dragon God Valley. Although you’re talented, you don’t have enough combat experience. You need more training. We’ll leave the Feng family head to you. We’ll support you!”</p><p>“There’s indeed a problem!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and there was a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>He originally thought that Duan Yan and Fu Xing had problems, but now it seemed that Xu long also had problems.</p><p>In the beginning, Xu long had hidden his cultivation level and had ulterior motives. Now, he even asked Lu Ming to deal with the Feng family head alone. He was clearly trying to kill Lu Ming with a borrowed knife and use the Feng family head to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>The Feng family head naturally noticed the problem between Lu Ming and the rest. He seized the opportunity and launched a storm of attacks on Lu Ming. He still had a chance to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior brothers, I can’t hold on any longer!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He exchanged a blow with the Feng family head and deliberately retreated to Xu long and the others.</p><p>Ding Ling Ling!</p><p>The Feng family master chased after Lu Ming. The soul-shaking Bell vibrated and invisible waves enveloped Xu long and the other two.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Xu long and the other two roared in their hearts, but they had no choice but to resist.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, senior brothers!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered coldly, causing Xu long and the other two to turn pale.</p><p>Ding Ling Ling!</p><p>The sound of the bell made Xu long and the other two’s faces turn pale. It was obvious that their spiritual gods had been attacked and were injured.</p><p>“Senior brother Xu long, we must take him down as soon as possible!”</p><p>Duan Yan said.</p><p>If this continued, their souls would suffer a lot of injuries. Physical injuries were easy to recover, but soul injuries were hard to recover. The price of spirit herbs that could recover the soul was shockingly high.</p><p>“Attack with all your might!”</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A bright sword light bloomed from Xu Long’s hand and shot toward the Feng family master.</p><p>Duan Yan and Fu Xing fully cooperated with Xu long.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming deliberately wandered around the Feng family head and occasionally attacked.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, what are you doing? Why aren’t you attacking with all your might and capturing this person?”</p><p>Xu long shouted.</p><p>I can’t. Just now, I blocked it alone and my vitality was greatly damaged. My spirit is weak and I don’t have any strength left. I need to recover slowly!</p><p>Lu Ming was making up nonsense.</p><p>Xu Long’s expression turned ugly. He knew that Lu Ming was taking revenge for not attacking them earlier.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not put in any effort, Xu long and the other two could not take down the Feng family head at once. As time passed, their faces turned paler and paler. It was obvious that their souls were severely injured.</p><p>This kind of soul injury would take a few years to heal.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing roared in their hearts. It was all Lu Ming’s fault. If Lu Ming had cooperated with them and attacked with all his might, he would have taken down the Feng family’s family head long ago. How could their souls be injured?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. Black wings suddenly appeared on his back and he slashed horizontally.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black wing was a holy weapon. How could the Feng family head resist it? he was swept away by the black wing. He fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared in front of the Feng family head. He slapped the Feng family head nine times in a row, sealing his essential core.</p><p>The Feng family head immediately fell to the ground.</p><p>“Holy weapon!”</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing’s eyes revealed fear.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why didn’t you use your holy weapon earlier?”</p><p>Duan Yan glared at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>“Do you think you can use a Saint weapon just because you want to? It consumes a lot of true essence. I used too much true essence to resist the Feng family head just now, so I’ve only recovered a little!”</p><p>Lu Ming casually explained.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and his breathing was stable. He did not look like he was running out of essential core. He was clearly lying.</p><p>However, they did not help Lu Ming just now. They could not refute Lu Ming’s words and could not voice their grievances.</p><p>A cold light flashed in the depths of Xu Long’s eyes. Then, he smiled and said, ” I believe that Junior Brother Lu Ming has given it his all. Now that the Feng family head has been captured, let’s ask him why he wants to kill us!</p><p>Then, they walked to the Feng family head.</p><p>“Old man, tell me, why do you want to kill us? If you don’t tell me the truth, I’ll skin you alive and make you beg for death!”</p><p>Duan Yan said ruthlessly, her eyes full of resentment.</p><p>Her soul had been injured by the Feng family head, and it would take a few years to recover. She really wanted to skin the Feng family head alive.</p><p>“AI! If you set up everything and everything is lost, I’ll say it, I’ll confess everything!”</p><p>The Feng family head sighed, looking a little down and out.</p><p>everything starts from an ancient ruin that I accidentally discovered …</p><p>The Feng family head sighed again.</p><p>“An ancient ruin?”</p><p>The eyes of Xu long, Duan Yan, and the others suddenly lit up.</p><p>Usually, when it came to ancient ruins, there was a high chance that treasures would appear, and it would be a great opportunity.</p><p>that’s right. When I was in the six Kong mountain, I accidentally stumbled into an ancient cave abode and obtained a cultivation technique from there. It requires the blood and soul of others to cultivate, and my cultivation can improve by leaps and bounds!</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>no wonder your cultivation is different from the records. You’ve reached Lv 4 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Xu long said, obviously believing him.</p><p>that’s right, I’ve cultivated that cultivation technique. Furthermore, according to the records in that cultivation technique, the younger a heaven’s favorite is, the more effective their blood and soul will be, and the faster their cultivation will improve!</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>so, you planned to attract the disciples of Dragon God Valley to kill you and use their blood and souls to cultivate!</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>“Not bad!” The Feng family head nodded.</p><p>“How dare you! Aren’t you afraid that your entire clan will be killed?”</p><p>Duan Yan berated.</p><p>hahaha, if my plan had succeeded, I would have killed all of you and my cultivation would have improved greatly. By then, I would have taken all the treasures in the ancient ruins and left the Cang region. The yuan continent is so vast, how could the Dragon God Valley find us? it’s a pity that we failed at the last step and were defeated by a first level Martial Emperor!</p><p>The Feng family laughed.</p><p>“You’re saying that there are more treasures in the ancient ruins?”</p><p>Duan Yan caught on to the Feng family head’s words, her eyes filled with greed.</p><p>It was the same for Xu long and Fu Xing.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The Feng family head nodded.</p><p>“Quickly bring us there!”</p><p>Duan Yan said anxiously.</p><p>no, unless you promise to let me go, don’t expect me to take you there. Without me, you can’t find the six void mountain!</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>“Hmph, if you don’t, I’ll kill you right now!”</p><p>Duan Yan’s eyes were cold, and a cold killing intent enveloped the Feng family head.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xu long pointed the long sword in his hand at the Feng family head’s neck and said, ” bring us there, or we’ll die right now. If there really is an ancient ruin, I promise to let you go!</p><p>“You will really let me go, unless you discover the blood oath!”</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Xu Long’s long sword shook, and a sword Qi burst out, cutting off one of the Feng family master’s ears.</p><p>nonsense, I’ll do what I say. If you go overboard, you’ll die now!</p><p>Xu Long’s voice was cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
