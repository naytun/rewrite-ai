Every step he took left a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>It was Yin Feng. The person who retreated was Yin Feng.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yin Feng was pushed back by the attack. He howled into the sky and his body was covered in silver light as if he had turned into a silver person. The power of his territory and spirit body was activated to the extreme. He put on the pair of Emperor gloves again and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The power of this punch made the others turn pale with fright as they felt a powerful shock.</p><p>Yin Feng was too strong. They felt that if they were in his place, they would not even have bones left when they faced Yin Feng’s punch.</p><p>“He is indeed very strong!”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s thought.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that Yin Feng was stronger than di Xian, whom he had encountered before.</p><p>However, what did Lu Ming have to fear?</p><p>The early stage of the chaos realm covered his fist. He punched out, and the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele flashed on his fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fists met for the second time.</p><p>A blinding light burst out from where the two of them were standing.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared at the two of them.</p><p>Who would win?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The light exploded, and a figure was sent flying far away, hitting the ice wall of the valley.</p><p>“It’s yinfeng!”</p><p>“It’s him, he’s lost!”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>On the side, the other young man who came with Yin Feng and Yin feizhang widened their eyes in disbelief. They felt as if they were dreaming and could not believe what was happening.</p><p>Yin Feng was a famous heaven’s favorite in Dragon God Valley. He had an innate spirit body and unparalleled combat strength. There were not many who could match him in the same level.</p><p>But now, he had been defeated by people from a mere Savage Island.</p><p>Furthermore, it was a crushing defeat.</p><p>How could a person from a deserted island be so strong?</p><p>“Kill! I’m going to tear you apart!”</p><p>Yin Feng had gone completely mad. A silver true dragon appeared above his head. Yin Feng performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a silver true dragon that pounced at Lu Ming madly.</p><p>“Is it useful to go crazy?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He soared into the sky and punched out with both fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain, weighing hundreds of millions of catties, struck the silver true dragon.</p><p>The silver Dragon roared and rolled in the sky. However, after a few moves, the body of the silver Dragon trembled and cracks appeared before it exploded.</p><p>Within the silver light, Yin Feng’s main body appeared.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down from above and took nine steps. All nine steps landed on Yin Feng’s face, leaving nine shoe prints.</p><p>Yin Feng’s body crashed heavily onto the ground and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How do you feel about being stepped on the face by the ant you speak of?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>His words made Yin Feng’s chest tighten, and he spat out another mouthful of blood. His aura was extremely weak.</p><p>He was furious!</p><p>Yin Feng’s entire body seemed to be burning with anger and was filled with crazy killing intent.</p><p>He had actually been stepped on by an ant. If this matter were to spread, he would definitely become the laughingstock of Dragon God Valley and be ridiculed by his competitors.</p><p>All of this was due to his defeat to Lu Ming. He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>“Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>If this place wasn’t Dragon God Valley, he wouldn’t have let Yin Feng leave. He would have killed him and left no one alive.</p><p>However, this was Dragon God Valley. Lu Ming had just arrived here. Moreover, Yin Feng’s background was definitely not simple. If Lu Ming killed Yin Feng in front of everyone, he would definitely face revenge and be in danger.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming let yinfeng go.</p><p>“Bastard, just you wait, just you wait!”</p><p>After Yin Feng said that, he left with Yin feizhang and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve offended yinfeng. I’m afraid he’ll take revenge on you!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying walked over and said worriedly.</p><p>it’s fine. I didn’t kill Yin Feng. I only injured him. It’s a fight between peers. The elders won’t be so shameless as to take revenge. They’ll only take revenge between peers. I’ll be more careful among peers. It should be fine!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Haha, I’m finally fine!”</p><p>the blood oath contract has been torn!</p><p>Not far away, laughter could be heard.</p><p>Those who had signed the blood oath contract were even more ecstatic.</p><p>As the blood oath contract had been torn apart by Lu Ming, it naturally had no effect.</p><p>However, when they looked at Lu Ming, fear flashed in their eyes. No one came over to thank him.</p><p>They thought of yinfeng!</p><p>Since Lu Ming had offended yinfeng, yinfeng would definitely take revenge in the future. If they were too close to Lu Ming, they would be implicated.</p><p>Their eyes flickered and they chose to stay away from Lu Ming, returning to their respective cave abodes.</p><p>“These people are truly ungrateful …”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said hatefully.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind.</p><p>This was human nature. Lu Ming had helped them just now and prevented them from being enslaved by Yin Feng. Perhaps, he could save their lives in the great emperor secret realm. However, these people simply ignored all these.</p><p>Compared to facing yinfeng’s revenge, they ignored Lu Ming’s kindness and chose to stay away from him.</p><p>Humans were just that realistic sometimes.</p><p>“Brother, thank you for your help!”</p><p>At this moment, the triplets walked over and one of them thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>The other two cupped their fists.</p><p>“No need to be so polite. May I know how to address the three of you?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming admired the triplets ‘unyielding character.</p><p>I’m the boss, and my name is Yuan Tian. He’s the second brother, Yuan di, and the second brother, Yuan Ren. The two of them can’t speak!</p><p>Ruan Tian introduced.</p><p>“You can’t speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao and the rest were stunned.</p><p>It was rare to see a martial arts powerhouse who could not speak.</p><p>This was because martial arts powerhouses had powerful bodies and had incredible control over their bodies.</p><p>The chronic diseases of mortals were no problem for martial arts powerhouses at all.</p><p>Therefore, mute was somewhat inconceivable to martial Dao powerhouses.</p><p>The few of them chatted for a while more before returning to their cave abodes.</p><p>The Ruan brothers needed to go back and heal their injuries.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he returned to his cave abode and continued cultivating.</p><p>Now, the embryonic form of the chaos realm was getting closer and closer to the limit. Lu Ming believed that he would be able to cultivate to the limit before entering the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>That way, he would be able to break through to the Emperor realm and seize the initiative.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
