Although he was only at the early stage of the LV 4 Martial Emperor realm, he was finally able to fight the Feng family head to a draw with his powerful combat strength.</p><p>“Did he hide his cultivation level?”</p><p>...</p><p>There was a flash of light in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Xu long had been hiding his cultivation all this time, but now he had no choice but to reveal it.</p><p>Xu Long’s outburst shocked the Feng family.</p><p>Feng Yi’s eyes were cold. kid, I’ll kill you first. Then, I’ll think of a way to deal with the others. Die!</p><p>Feng Yi’s pitch-black claws were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at Feng Yi’s claw. With a crack, Feng Yi’s claw was twisted and deformed. The bones in his hand were shattered by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Feng Yi let out a shrill scream.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch at Feng Yi’s dantian. A terrifying force exploded and destroyed Feng Yi’s dantian in an instant. Feng Yi’s figure was like a kite with a broken string. He flew a few hundred meters away and crashed into a small hill. He was no longer breathing.</p><p>Although Feng Yi’s cultivation was at the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm, there was still a big gap between his combat strength and that of the disciples of the Dragon God Valley, not to mention the geniuses like he Yu and Wang Xiao. In Lu Ming’s hands, he could not even put up a fight.</p><p>“Yi ‘er!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! the Feng family head roared, his berserk killing intent erupting.</p><p>“Kill that brat!”</p><p>The Feng family head roared.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>One of the elders who had been surrounding Duan Yan and Fu Xing pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A palm print as black as ink and with a foul smell came crashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The chaos Domain covered his entire body as he cast the prison-suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>The fist force crushed over, and the stench was swept away.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist and the palm collided, and a shocking fluctuation burst out.</p><p>Then, the old man grunted and his body shook violently. He was sent flying by Lu Ming. He was in the air and blood seeped out of his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed towards his opponent. He waved his fists continuously and dozens of fist forces flooded towards his opponent.</p><p>The other party roared and tried his best to resist. However, under Lu Ming’s storm-like fist force, he seemed to be vulnerable.</p><p>When the fist force dissipated, the old man was also smashed into pieces.</p><p>The fact that a third level Martial Emperor was killed by Lu Ming in an instant shocked everyone.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is really so powerful!”</p><p>Duan Yan and Fu Xing’s eyes flickered, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, come and help me kill this man!”</p><p>Xu long roared.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and dashed toward the battlefield between Xu long and the Feng family head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The air buzzed as he threw a punch, and the terrifying force of the punch headed toward the Feng family head.</p><p>After exchanging a blow with Lu Ming, the Feng family head trembled and actually took a step back.</p><p>how can a Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert be so powerful? he must be the peerless genius of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>A look of shock flashed through the eyes of the Feng family head.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xu long also launched a fierce attack. Under the joint attack of Lu Ming and Xu long, the Feng family head was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Ding Ling Ling!</p><p>At this moment, a black bell floated above the Feng family head and rang.</p><p>An invisible fluctuation spread out. Lu Ming felt his spiritual God tremble slightly as it was attacked by an invisible force.</p><p>The sound of the bell could actually attack the spiritual God. To be more precise, it could attack the soul within the spiritual God.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s soul was very powerful. Moreover, the spiritual God was wearing a Jade armor. At this time, the Jade armor was emitting a layer of light that enveloped the spiritual God. Lu Ming’s spiritual God only trembled slightly and was fine.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Long’s expression changed drastically. His body trembled and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The Feng family head seized the opportunity and launched a fierce attack on Lu Ming and Xu long.</p><p>Lu Ming threw out two punches and blocked his opponent’s attack. However, Xu Long’s body trembled and a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, stop this person first. I’ll help Junior Sister Duan Yan and the rest kill those people, then I’ll come and help you!</p><p>At this moment, Xu long bellowed and retreated, leaving the Feng family head to Lu Ming alone, exposing Lu Ming to the Feng family head’s attack.</p><p>haha, it seems that the disciples of Dragon God Valley are also scheming against each other. Then you shall die first!</p><p>The Feng family head sneered. The bell above his head jingled and invisible waves surged toward Lu Ming. At the same time, his palm, which was as black as ink and gave off a disgusting smell, was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. However, he did not say much. His essential core exploded and he fought with the other party.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged dozens of moves with the other party.</p><p>damn it, Why is my soul-shaking Bell useless against this kid? and this kid’s combat strength is too strong.</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked the Feng family head was.</p><p>No matter what he did, he could not do anything to Lu Ming. Lu Ming was like a rock in the sea, standing still.</p><p>On the other side, Xu long rushed to the battlefield where Duan Yan and the others were fighting. With his cultivation of the fourth level Martial Emperor realm and his powerful combat strength, he had the upper hand.</p><p>In a short while, he had killed three elders in a row. The situation had completely reversed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In Xu Long’s hand, a combat sword was flying like a dragon with amazing sword Qi. Duan Yan and Fu Xing cooperated with Xu long and attacked the remaining four old men like a storm.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Another old man was cut in half by Xu Long’s sword.</p><p>The remaining three people were even less of a match for Xu long and the other two.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The remaining three had no intention of staying. They wanted to escape, but Xu long and the other two held them back.</p><p>Soon after, the one who was fighting with Xu long was also killed by him.</p><p>The remaining two old men were killed by Xu long one after another.</p><p>The Feng clan’s patriarch was the only one left at the scene.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>The Feng family head roared.</p><p>The combat power of the people from Dragon God Valley this time was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Based on the difficulty of the mission he issued to Dragon God Valley, he should not have sent a disciple of the Dragon God Valley who was at the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm. However, he did not expect that one of the disciples, Xu long, had hidden his cultivation. His own cultivation was at the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was even more shocking. He was only at the first level of the martial Royal realm, but he was able to stop him.</p><p>Moreover, his scheme had been seen through by Lu Ming. Lu Ming and the rest had not stepped into the formation, which led to the current situation.</p><p>“Dammit, I’m going all out!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Feng family head’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. He spat out a mouthful of blood onto the bell above his head, causing it to emit a layer of bloody light and ring. Its power increased by a level.</p><p>Waves of invisible energy gushed toward Lu Ming and attacked his spiritual God. However, they were all blocked by the Jade armor.</p><p>At this moment, Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing stood aside but did not come to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior brother Xu long, please help us. Let’s kill this man together!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
