He’s back!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of the stone bridge, a figure walked over. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the starting point.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was a young man with a burning gaze.”Kid, take me there now!”</p><p>This young man was the one who sneered the most earlier. He thought that Lu Ming would die on the bridge. Now that he saw that Lu Ming could really bring people over, he was the first to rush forward.</p><p>“Me too, take me there!”</p><p>“Bring me!”</p><p>One by one, the young men stepped forward and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m not free!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>“What do you mean by this? Not free? If you don’t take me there, then you don’t need to go there yourself!”</p><p>The expression of the young man who spoke first turned cold. An ice-cold engine was locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>The other people also looked unfriendly.</p><p>indeed. You want to get the great Emperor’s treasure and leave us here. How can you do that? ”</p><p>Someone said. Lu Ming was so angry that he almost laughed. He did not have the ability to go over and yet he was blaming Lu Ming.</p><p>Since he could not get it, he could not let Lu Ming get it.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>scram! Lu Ming roared. A terrifying blast spread in all directions. Those with weaker cultivation could not help but retreat.</p><p>everyone, let’s join forces. With so many of us, it’s enough to take him down. Let’s control him and let him send us over one by one!</p><p>The young man who spoke first shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Auras burst out one after another. There were at least a few hundred people at the scene. Each and every one of them stared at Lu Ming with unfriendly eyes, and their auras pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“How can you people be like this? how can you force us to bring you along? Lu Ming, don’t worry about us. You can cross the bridge first!”</p><p>Ruan Tian’s deep voice rang out.</p><p>kid, surrender now. If you cross the bridge alone, your friends will fall into this endless abyss!</p><p>It was still the young man who had spoken first. He spoke coldly.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and looked at the young man. “He really brought this upon himself!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared in front of the youth.</p><p>The young man’s expression changed and he wanted to retreat. However, Lu Ming waved his hand and the chaos Domain covered him, forming a huge hand of chaos that crushed the young man’s defense and caught him in his hand.</p><p>“Let me go, what do you want to do? I’m warning you, my senior brother is the leader of the heaven seat King …”</p><p>The young man shouted and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll send you to the abyss to play!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … You dare? Everyone, let’s attack together and capture this person!”</p><p>The young man roared, instigating the others.</p><p>“Put him down!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>More than a dozen people shouted as they charged at Lu Ming. More than a dozen attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lightning origin technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain turned into a Thunder domain. He cast the Thunder elemental technique and thrust his palm forward. Ten lightning Spears appeared in the air and pierced through the air.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>More than a dozen young masters were directly pierced by the lightning Spears and died on the spot.</p><p>The fact that he had killed more than ten first level martial Royal realm young men with a single palm caused the others ‘expressions to change drastically.</p><p>They finally realized that not only could Lu Ming cross the stone bridge by himself, but he could also bring people over with him. He relied on his terrifying abilities.</p><p>After killing more than ten young men as a warning to the others, the rest of them were too afraid to make a move. Lu Ming waved his hand, grabbed the young man’s big hand, and brought him out of the abyss.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>Looking down at the endless abyss, the young man was so scared that he kept screaming.</p><p>“I’ll send you down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and opened his palm. The young man was devoured by the devouring power of the abyss and fell into the endless abyss. Only his shrill screams could be heard faintly.</p><p>“Who else wants to go down? I don’t mind giving you a ride!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the entire venue.</p><p>No one dared to make a sound. Lu Ming’s combat strength could completely crush them.</p><p>“Brother ruan, let’s get on the bridge!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three Ruan brothers nodded and stood in a row with Lu Ming. They walked forward and soon crossed the stone bridge.</p><p>In front of the stone bridge was a stone wall that blocked the way. This stone wall was indestructible and could not be broken.</p><p>On the stone wall, there was a door of light. This was the only way.</p><p>The people who had come over earlier had obviously left through this door of light.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and stepped through the door of light.</p><p>The space trembled. In the next moment, Lu Ming was in a stone room.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and realized that he was the only one in the stone room.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and the others were nowhere to be found.</p><p>It seemed that the door was a teleportation door. It teleported them in and separated them.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a sharp aura coming at him.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming took a step forward and retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the sharp intent was also astonishingly fast. It followed closely behind Lu Ming and slashed at him.</p><p>“What the hell is that?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He could only vaguely see a black light slashing at him. As to what it was, it was too fast and he could not see clearly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and threw a punch.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out. Lu Ming’s violent fist force crushed forward and finally pushed back the thing that was slashing at him. At this time, Lu Ming finally saw what had attacked him.</p><p>A pair of wings!</p><p>It had a pair of jet-black wings. They were not the wings of a demonic beast, but rather, they were made from a strange metal.</p><p>Every feather on the wings was black and shiny. They were sharp like divine swords.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of hai pengtian from the divine Ruins ‘continents. Hai pengtian also had a pair of wings, which was an Emperor spirit weapon.</p><p>However, that pair of wings was trash when compared to the pair in front of him.</p><p>The pair in front of him were holy weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming fell in love with it at one glance.</p><p>“I’m quite lucky. I’ve just teleported here and I’ve already encountered a holy weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took a step forward and pounced toward the black wings. He reached out his hand and was about to grab the black wings.</p><p>Chi Chi ~!</p><p>The black wings spread open like two divine swords, slashing toward Lu Ming. They were extremely sharp.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his fist and activated the prison suppressing heavenly art. He covered it with the chaos Domain and bombarded the wings.</p><p>With a clang, the wing was once again sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Its wings were sent flying, and it actually flapped to escape.</p><p>“You have some intelligence, but you can’t escape from me!”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed forward with one hand and the chaos realm erupted, enveloping the entire stone room. No matter how the black wings flew, they could not escape the range of the chaos realm.</p><p>“Shrink!”</p><p>The chaos Domain began to shrink and finally trapped the black wing.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s essential core surged into the black wings and began to refine them.</p><p>Soon after, the wing shrank slowly and was caught by Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
