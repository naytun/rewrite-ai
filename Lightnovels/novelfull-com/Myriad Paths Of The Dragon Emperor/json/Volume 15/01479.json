However, there were wisps of black mist floating in the air.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>His body-protection genuine vitality was making a sizzling sound.</p><p>The black mist was corroding his true essence.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly cast the chaos realm to cover his entire body and resist the surrounding black mist.</p><p>However, this black mist was extremely shocking. It adhered to the primal Chaos Domain, and even the primal Chaos Domain emitted a sizzling sound.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that even the black wings were the same. The black wings were stuck to the black mist and also emitted the sound of corrosion.</p><p>It could even corrode the chaos realm and holy weapons. Lu Ming’s expression turned ugly and he could not help but stop.</p><p>It was too dangerous to continue.</p><p>“It’s actually this kind of aura?”</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan’s expression was grave and uncertain.</p><p>“Dandan, this aura? What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s not an aura from this world!”</p><p>Dandan said a vague sentence.</p><p>“Not in this world? Could it be the heaven realm?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Dandan shook her head, looked up into the distance, and said nothing more.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Behind him, the earth rumbled, and the figure of a giant black Bull the size of a small hill appeared.</p><p>nest, you’re here again. Is there a need to be like this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. The five experts of the sky demon sect had died, but this black giant was still chasing after them.</p><p>This Big Shot was too powerful. It could easily kill a seventh level Martial Emperor. Similarly, it could also kill Lu Ming easily. Lu Ming could only brace himself and continue to run forward.</p><p>The further he went, the thicker the black mist became. His Chaos Domain and black wings kept making a sizzling sound.</p><p>The giant black Bull suddenly stopped after chasing for a while. It seemed to be a little afraid. After neighing a few times, it turned around and ran away.</p><p>this bull has finally left. What’s going on? it seems to be very afraid!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course he’s afraid. Little brat, run quickly, go forward …”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>At this moment, hissing sounds could be heard from both sides. Then, Lu Ming saw two disgusting pythons crawling over.</p><p>There was a giant python on each side. This giant python had three heads and its body was more than a hundred meters in diameter.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that his body was in tatters, and black liquid was constantly flowing out of it. It was extremely horrifying.</p><p>It was a giant python that Lu Ming had never heard of or seen before. It exuded an extremely evil aura and gave off a feeling that it was ten times more terrifying than the black giant from before.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why the black giant had suddenly escaped. It was because of the two giant pythons.</p><p>The giant python appeared, its Crimson eyes staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Lu Ming sprinted forward without any hesitation.</p><p>Hiss … Hiss …</p><p>When the two pythons saw that Lu Ming had escaped, they hissed with their three heads and twisted their huge bodies to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Its body was a hundred meters in diameter and it was like two mountain ranges. Lu Ming was like an ant in front of it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Black wings flapped continuously. He completely ignored the black mist and flew forward at top speed.</p><p>From time to time, he still needed bubbles ‘help to escape from the two giant pythons’ pursuit. Otherwise, Lu Ming would have been devoured by the two terrifying giant pythons.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the mist around him became thicker and thicker, and the power of corrosion became stronger and stronger.</p><p>As Lu Ming tried to escape, he had to resist the surrounding black mist at the same time. He had expended a lot of energy. At this moment, Lu Ming was already sweating all over and panting heavily.</p><p>As for bubbles, it was almost the same. It was so tired that it was lying on Lu Ming.</p><p>“What is this place? it’s so strange. Am I going to die Here today? Buried in the snake’s stomach? No, I can’t die Here. I promised little Qing that I’ll soar through the clouds with her!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>A light flashed between his eyebrows, and Ming Lian’s second body appeared. He took a step forward, and dense inscriptions appeared. As for his main body, it entered the mountain and river diagram, devouring raw stones and recovering.</p><p>After this period of time, the second body had completely recovered. Moreover, it was a blessing in disguise. His cultivation had improved and he had already lit four lamps of mind.</p><p>The second body hurried on. After a while, when the mental energy fire of the second body was also greatly consumed, the main body appeared and continued to move forward.</p><p>Hiss … Hiss …</p><p>At this time, the two giant pythons suddenly stopped and looked ahead. They seemed to reveal a look of fear, and then directly turned around and slithered away.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to turn cold.</p><p>He thought of the giant bull from before. Could it be that he had entered the territory of an even more terrifying existence and scared the two pythons away?</p><p>Lu Ming stood rooted to the ground. For a moment, he did not know where to go.</p><p>He now knew that this area was a forbidden land full of dangers!</p><p>“Lu Ming, continue forward!”</p><p>Dandan looked into the distance and said.</p><p>“Continue forward? The further we go, the stronger the black mist is. We don’t even know what kind of terrifying existence it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At this moment, the black mist caused his Chaos Domain to tremble. If this continued, Lu Ming would not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>As for the black wings, Lu Ming had already put them away. Otherwise, they might be corroded.</p><p>“Listen to this Lord, that’s right!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll listen to you this once!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and strode forward.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, they did not encounter any danger as they continued to move forward. There were no exotic beasts either.</p><p>After walking for about a thousand miles, Lu Ming suddenly stopped. He widened his eyes and looked ahead. He seemed to be frozen.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming saw a scene that shocked him.</p><p>In front of them, an ancient tree that reached the sky rose from the ground and pierced through the depths of the void.</p><p>This ancient tree was too big, too tall, and too majestic. It was like the legendary tree of the world, as tall as the sky. On the branches, there were wisps of the great Dao’s aura, which was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree!</p><p>Lu Ming recognized it at a glance. It was a path-understanding ancient tree, a fully matured path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>It was said that in the distant past, many top experts would have a path-understanding ancient tree beside them.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a fully matured path-understanding ancient tree here.</p><p>A figure was sitting cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>This figure was extremely tall and majestic. Just by sitting there cross-legged, the top of his head broke into the firmament. Clouds and mist curled around his body. His body was even taller than a towering mountain peak.</p><p>How could he have such a majestic body?</p><p>However, due to the distance and the black mist, Lu Ming could not see the figure’s appearance clearly. He could only vaguely see that there seemed to be two horns on the top of the figure’s head, two horns that looked like bull’s horns.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
