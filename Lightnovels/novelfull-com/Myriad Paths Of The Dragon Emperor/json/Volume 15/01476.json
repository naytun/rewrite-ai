They intertwined with each other and blocked all of Lu Ming’s escape routes.</p><p>five seventh level martial emperors and one sixth level Martial Emperor!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>One of them was a young man with long hair that fluttered in the wind. He carried a demonic blade on his back and looked like a young demonic god with an overbearing aura.</p><p>This person was at the sixth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>The other five people’s faces couldn’t be seen clearly. They were covered in a pitch-black demonic light and their terrifying auras shot into the sky.</p><p>These five people were all at the seventh level martial Royal realm.</p><p>“The Tian Yu demon sect really thinks highly of me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he stared at the young man.</p><p>The blade just now had come from this young man.</p><p>He was a terrifying heaven’s favorite!</p><p>you’ve injured our Tianyu demonic sect’s prodigy and disrespected our Holy Virgin. You think you can leave so easily? you’re too naive!</p><p>The young man spoke, his killing intent as cold as a blade.</p><p>“Hehe, the sky demon sect is one of the thirteen top sects in the Azure continent. Is this all you can do? If your peers can’t beat you, you’ll send someone stronger to kill you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Anyway, you’re dead. No one will know about this!”</p><p>The young man’s face was still cold and calm. He stepped forward toward Lu Ming. With every step he took, an extremely powerful pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. His mind was spinning rapidly, thinking of a way to escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll give you a chance to hand over the cultivation technique you have and I might spare your life!”</p><p>The young man said, a hint of greed flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He was there when Lu Ming and Jin Yu fought in the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Jin Yu’s level five territory with his level two territory. He was very curious as to what technique Lu Ming had cultivated to have such a terrifying territory.</p><p>“Oh? If you want my cultivation method, you have to tell me one question. Who sent you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The young man’s eyes flashed, then he sneered, ” “I just wanted to kill you. Alright, speak!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly roared and rushed toward the young man. He flapped his black wings and a gust of wind swept toward the young man. His two wings were like two heavenly blades, slashing at the other party.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man coldly spoke. He didn’t unsheathe the devil saber on his back, but rather, he slashed out with his palm.</p><p>A shocking demonic blade appeared and slashed forward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The demonic blade slashed at the black wings, causing them to tremble violently. Lu Ming’s body retreated like a cannonball, his qi and blood in his body churning and blood flowing from his mouth.</p><p>Without a doubt, this young man was a top heaven’s favorite. His battle strength was shocking.</p><p>Although his cultivation was at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm, his combat strength could definitely kill a seventh level martial Royal realm expert, or even be comparable to an eighth level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>don’t attack. Seal the area. I’ll kill him!</p><p>The young man said coldly as he stepped forward and closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The young man struck out with his palm, and a terrifying demonic blade slashed down at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a shield appeared. It enlarged and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The demonic blade slashed at the shield and the shield trembled. The shield and Lu Ming were both sent flying.</p><p>holy weapon, it’s a holy weapon again. You have a lot of treasures on you, but it’s a pity that you’re a piece of trash, wasting these treasures for nothing. In the future, I’ll help you keep these treasures. Remember, the one who killed you is mo he of the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>The greed in the young man’s eyes grew even more intense, and the aura around him grew even stronger. With a wave of his hand, a demonic blade appeared behind his back, and a terrifying blade light stirred up the wind and clouds.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted. He flapped his wings and pounced at mo he like a Black Lightning.</p><p>Mo he’s eyes turned cold. Just as he was about to slash out with his saber, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared and enveloped mo he. His body was frozen in place.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>seal! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. Five gates of sealing appeared around mo he and pressed down on him.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Mo he roared madly. His demonic Qi burst out and turned into a shocking blade light along the demonic blade, bombarding the transparent bubble. The transparent bubble rumbled and shook violently. It only lasted for a breath before it shattered.</p><p>The transparent bubble burst, and the five sealing gates pressed down.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Mo he struggled with all his might, and the saber radiance broke through the air. The five sealing gates were also broken one by one.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming had already appeared not far from mo he.</p><p>Godly sword technique!</p><p>Two rays of black light shot out from Lu Ming’s eyes. Like two divine swords, they shot into mo he’s body and went straight to his spiritual God.</p><p>Spiritual God mo he trembled, and his aura became unstable.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. In the sky, a huge chaos seal, like an ancient divine mountain, pressed down on mo he, bringing with it waves of terrifying air.</p><p>Even mo he’s pupils shrank when he saw the might. He couldn’t ignore it.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! mo he roared. His entire body seemed to have turned into a demonic blade as he soared into the sky.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal collided heavily with the demonic blade, producing a deafening boom. At this moment, time seemed to have frozen.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Dandan cried out as her body flew out and flew above the chaos sky-turning seal. Her body rapidly grew in size, and dense inscriptions appeared on her entire body. Her entire body seemed to have turned into a mountain, a turtle-shaped mountain, and she stepped heavily on the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The weight of the chaos sky-turning seal increased sharply in an instant. The saber Light transformed by mo he was shattered, and the chaos sky-turning seal continued to suppress mo he.</p><p>Mo he roared angrily. He raised his palms and bombarded the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal was pierced through, but mo he’s body also fell down like a meteorite because of this force.</p><p>As mo he fell, there was an opening in the encirclement that they had formed.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles screeched and a space-time Tunnel appeared. Lu Ming brought dandan and bubbles into the void tunnel and appeared thousands of miles away. Then, he flapped his black wings and flew forward at top speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Mo he rushed up into the sky again. His eyes were filled with shocking flames as he roared in Fury, ” “Chase!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Mo he and the other five Lv 7 martial Royal realm experts turned into six demonic lights and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of raw gemstones and devoured them to recover his essential core. At the same time, he increased his speed to the maximum and fled at top speed.</p><p>He knew that the attack just now could not do anything to mo he.</p><p>Mo he’s combat strength was too powerful. Just now, mo he had underestimated his opponent and was caught off guard by Lu Ming. Lu Ming had used dandan and bubbles to launch a series of attacks. In the end, he had used the chaos sky-turning seal, dandan’s power, and the divine sword technique to send mo he flying.</p><p>However, it shouldn’t be able to hurt mo he.</p><p>After all, mo he himself was a top heaven’s favorite with powerful combat strength. Lu Ming’s cultivation base was much lower than his. This was already the limit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
