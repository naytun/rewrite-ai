A powerful aura emanated from his body and crushed the auras of the three silver Dragon Valley youths.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>...</p><p>Then, Lu Ming roared.</p><p>With this roar, Lu Ming used the divine sword technique. An invisible wave surged towards the three of them and directly blasted into their spiritual gods.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual gods of the three of them trembled violently as if they had been hit by a hurricane. At the same time, in their eyes, Lu Ming seemed to have turned into a prehistoric giant beast, and a terrifying aura pressed down on them.</p><p>Their bodies trembled violently, and with a loud cry, they actually fell to the ground, their bodies drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>On the side, a few onlookers were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s roar made the three silver Dragon Valley youths fall to the ground. It was unbelievable.</p><p>Of course, they didn’t know that it was because of the miraculous godly sword technique.</p><p>The main purpose of the godly sword technique was to increase one’s soul power and then use it to launch an attack.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming had already cultivated the divine sword technique to an invisible state. With a loud shout, the divine sword technique was activated and it directly attacked the soul of the opponent. It was invisible and extremely mysterious.</p><p>The three silver Dragon Valley young men’s spiritual gods were attacked by Lu Ming. Their spiritual gods trembled and they even had an illusion. They thought that they had seen a prehistoric giant beast. Their bodies and minds were shaken and they fell to the ground.</p><p>After a long while, the three of them finally reacted.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming, what sorcery did you use just now? I’m going to cripple you!”</p><p>The young man in the middle shouted, his face flushed red.</p><p>The other two young men were in a similar state.</p><p>It was too embarrassing. They were so frightened by Lu Ming’s roar that they sat on the ground. If this were to spread, they would definitely become a laughing stock and be laughed at.</p><p>They blamed everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them roared and charged at Lu Ming with a burst of vital essence.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared again. This shout not only contained the divine sword technique’s attack but also powerful vital essence. The vital essence formed a storm and blasted out.</p><p>After reaching the martial Royal realm, the higher the level of the spirit body, not only would the spirit body become stronger, but also the vital essence would become more robust and condensed.</p><p>For a martial Royal realm martial artist, the improvement of his cultivation was the joint improvement of his true essence and spirit body. Therefore, true essence and spirit body complemented each other.</p><p>Otherwise, a spirit body with a high level wouldn’t have such a strong combat power.</p><p>The higher the level of the spirit body, the higher the level of the Zhen Yuan.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation and medium-grade earth spiritual body, he could naturally crush his opponent with his essential core.</p><p>As soon as the three silver Dragon Valley young men pounced, they were hit by the godly sword technique. Their spiritual souls trembled violently and they felt a tearing pain. Then, they were hit by Lu Ming’s vital essence. They wailed and spat out blood. Their bodies flew backward and fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>The surrounding people gasped in shock.</p><p>The three young men of the silver Dragon Valley were sitting on the ground after the shout.</p><p>Now, with a loud shout, the three of them were seriously injured and flew back while spitting blood.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the three of them and strode into the passage.</p><p>The three silver Dragon Valley young men struggled to get up after Lu Ming had left. Their eyes were filled with fear. Then, they walked into the passage.</p><p>After walking through the passageway, there was a counter at the entrance, and it was guarded.</p><p>This place was the real Guardian.</p><p>two hundred thousand mid-grade raw stones are required to get on the sky-connecting floating platform once!</p><p>One of the people at the counter said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and submitted two hundred thousand medium-grade raw stones.</p><p>He then stepped in and looked ahead.</p><p>A shocking scene was reflected in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>This place was in the middle of a few snowy mountains, forming a huge Col. The area was very wide.</p><p>In front of him, there were stone platforms floating in the air.</p><p>There were a total of thirty-six rows, and each row was slanted upward. Every hundred meters, there was a stone platform floating in the air. Just like that, there were thirteen stone platforms that extended into the void.</p><p>This was the sky-reaching floating platform. In short, it had a total of thirty-six rows, and each row had thirteen stone platforms. Each of them was a hundred meters apart and extended into the void.</p><p>At this moment, there were already some figures sitting cross-legged on some of the stone platforms.</p><p>Only one person could enter each row at a time.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that some people were sitting cross-legged on the third stone platform, some were sitting cross-legged on the fourth stone platform, and some were on the fifth stone platform …</p><p>On the stone platform, there were dense inscriptions that covered the person sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Some people stood below and watched.</p><p>It was said that the sky-reaching floating platform was created by the founder of the Dragon God Valley. It was very magical. When a person sat on it, his spirit would escape into the endless void. There was a battlefield opened by the Dragon God Valley’s founder. In it, there were heavenly beasts formed by the laws of the heavenly path. When Warriors fought with them, they could comprehend the heavenly path, domain, and even the laws.</p><p>With every stone platform, the corresponding difficulty level would increase.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward casually.</p><p>A few young men were watching. At that moment, they all looked at Lu Ming, their eyes gleaming.</p><p>At this moment, the three silver Dragon Valley youths who were injured by Lu Ming’s shout walked in and whispered something to the other youths. The other youths ‘eyes gleamed even more.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is getting more and more arrogant with the cloud Dragon Valley master’s support. I’ll go and meet him!” A silver-bubble youth said coldly.</p><p>He then strode toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The silver-bubble youth said coldly.</p><p>“That’s right. What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied casually.</p><p>you should come to the sky-connecting floating platform to cultivate as well. However, judging from your cultivation, you’re only at Lv 3 martial Royal realm. I’m afraid you won’t be able to break through many stone platforms. What a waste of the raw gemstones!</p><p>The silver-robed youth said, his tone carrying a hint of ridicule.</p><p>you don’t have to worry about how many stone platforms I can set foot on and whether I’ll waste the raw gemstones. Besides, you’re only at the LV 5 Martial Emperor realm. You might not be able to set foot on more stone platforms than me!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Not as much as you? “Ridiculous. Lu Ming, I think you’re too arrogant. You’re just a little talented, but you don’t know how high the sky is. There are countless geniuses in this world. There are many more in Dragon God Valley who are more talented than you!”</p><p>The silver-robed youth sneered.</p><p>“Oh, so you’re saying that your talent is very strong? I wonder if you dare to bet with me with your Lv 5 martial Royal realm cultivation?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Bet? How do we bet?”</p><p>The silver-robed youth’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Let’s bet on which of us can reach the higher stone platform!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You want to bet on this with me? Fine, I’ll agree to it. What’s the bet?”</p><p>The silver-robed youth immediately agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>There were a total of 13 stone platforms that extended into the sky.</p><p>Each of them corresponded to a level one territory. The first stone platform was equivalent to a level one territory, the second stone platform was equivalent to a level two territory, and so on.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the third level of the martial Royal realm and had a third level territory. No matter how strong his territory was, it was already not bad that he could step onto the fourth stone platform.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was a Lv 5 martial Royal realm expert, but his territory had reached level six. He could step onto the sixth stone platform to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming could only defeat him if he could step onto the seventh stone platform.</p><p>However, it was impossible for someone with a third-level domain to step onto the seventh stone platform. Therefore, he was sure to win. How could he not agree?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
