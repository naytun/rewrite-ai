He turned into a ray of light and disappeared into Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>The inscription refined secondary body was very rare. It could be considered as one of Lu Ming’s trump cards. In the yuan continent, not many people knew about it.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming would try his best not to expose it. That was why Lu Ming had left Ming Lian in the depths of the canyon to control the array just in case mo he escaped.</p><p>In this way, mo he didn’t know about the existence of the Ming Lian clone.</p><p>In the yuan continent, experts were as common as clouds and as common as rain. Danger was everywhere.</p><p>If he could keep a trump card, he might be able to save his life at a critical moment.</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear about how many dangers he had experienced along the way.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming soared into the sky and flew into the distance.</p><p>It was not safe to stay here for long. There might be experts from the Tian Yu demon sect coming later.</p><p>Very quickly, they had flown millions of miles. At this time, Lu Ming’s speed slowed down.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop for a moment!”</p><p>Dandan suddenly shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and asked dandan what was the matter.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll be taking my leave now!”</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>“You’re leaving?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Dandan nodded and said, ” in the past, in that godforsaken place of the divine wilderness continent, there was no place to go. But it’s different here. There are dangerous places and Forbidden Lands everywhere, but there are also fortuitous encounters everywhere. This is where I roam. I will rise up against the heavens, and if I continue to stay, I will soon be left behind by this little thing!</p><p>At the end of her sentence, dandan glanced at bubbles.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Could it be that this fellow wanted to leave after seeing that he was about to be shaken off by bubbles?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve seen the battle between the creature and the heavenly bull, haven’t you? although the heavenly bull is guarding the place, it’s useless. There’s more than one gap. The battle will come sooner or later, and it’s earlier than I expected!”</p><p>when that time comes, the world will fall apart. If I’m not careful, the entire world will be destroyed. I must improve my strength as soon as possible!</p><p>Dandan’s face was solemn, which was rare, and she said in a heavy tone.</p><p>“Dandan, the battle you often talk about, what exactly is it? Who was the enemy? Could it be that three-eyed creature? what exactly is that three-eyed creature?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a series of questions.</p><p>Dandan shook her head and said, ” your cultivation base is too weak. I can’t tell you for the time being. If I tell you, it will only distract you. You only need to know that the enemies you will face in the future are the real enemies, the real terrifying enemies. Some of the enemies you are facing now are child’s play, small fights.</p><p>that battle will be the peak battle, and it may also be the last battle. Judging from the current situation, it will be here soon. So, you should improve your strength as soon as possible. I’m leaving!</p><p>After saying that, his body turned into a ray of light and rushed into the distance.</p><p>However, in the next moment, there was a flash of light and dandan flew back. She looked at Lu Ming with a wicked smile and said,”Lu Ming, I’m leaving. Aren’t you going to give me some spirit herbs?”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming smacked his palm and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, you heartless guy …”</p><p>Dandan’s voice came from afar and then disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a trace of reluctance.</p><p>Although dandan’s words were unreliable, she had been following Lu Ming for so many years. From the moment Lu Ming left the blazing sun Empire, she had been following him. In the blink of an eye, it had been almost ten years.</p><p>If he were to leave now, he would be somewhat reluctant.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also understood that dandan was right. If this guy followed him, his recovery would be slower. In a place like the yuan continent, dandan might recover faster if she was alone.</p><p>As for dandan’s safety, Lu Ming was not worried. This fellow was sinister and cunning. Furthermore, he was knowledgeable and would be fine.</p><p>“I need to find a place to enter closed-door cultivation and comprehend it!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The scenes of the battle between the Titan longhorn beetle and the three-eyed creature flashed through his mind.</p><p>The scene was too shocking. The Titan longhorn beetle had the great Dao on its body. Its every move seemed to contain the truth of heaven and earth and the aura of the great Dao. Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain seemed to throb at the thought of it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also noticed something. As time passed, the image of the Titan longhorn beetle in his mind became fainter and fainter. The aura of the great Dao and the touch it had on the great Dao also became fainter and fainter.</p><p>It would probably disappear soon.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming wanted to find a place to cultivate in seclusion immediately. Otherwise, it would be a waste.</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming left the place. An hour later, Lu Ming found a hidden place and sat down cross-legged, the scenes of the battle between the Titan longhorn beetle and the three-eyed creature constantly replaying in his mind. Lu Ming’s understanding of the chaos realm was rapidly deepening.</p><p>Time quickly passed. In the blink of an eye, half a month had gone by.</p><p>At this moment, the chaos Domain spread out from Lu Ming’s body and spread in all directions. The area it covered was twice as large as before.</p><p>In the past half a month, the chaos Domain had rapidly improved and advanced at a tremendous pace. Now, it had even broken through and entered level three.</p><p>Third level Primal Chaos Domain!</p><p>At this moment, the battle between the Titan Longhorn and the three-eyed creature still remained in Lu Ming’s mind. However, it had faded and he could no longer sense the aura of the great Dao.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still very satisfied. If he cultivated normally, it would take at least a year or two for his Chaos Domain to break through to the third level.</p><p>But now, he had only used half a month to break through to level three. His gains were already very great.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was still at the early stage of the second level martial Royal realm. He had not made a breakthrough.</p><p>However, with the breakthrough in the chaos Domain, it was much easier to raise one’s cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, a storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>It was mo he’s storage ring. During this period of time, Lu Ming had been focused on comprehending and had not had the time to open it.</p><p>He broke mo he’s brand on the storage ring and scanned it with his spiritual senses. Lu Ming could see everything in the storage ring at a glance.</p><p>There were tens of millions of medium-grade raw stones. Lu Ming had made a huge profit.</p><p>There were also other spiritual herbs and materials. Lu Ming only took a quick glance.</p><p>There were also a few Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on a blue crystal combat sword.</p><p>This crystal sword was filled with a powerful aura.</p><p>Holy weapon, this was a holy weapon. There seemed to be water flowing on it. This was a water-attributed holy weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that mo he was kept in the storage ring because its attributes did not match with mo he’S. Lu Ming had made a fortune from it.</p><p>This Saint weapon could be exchanged for a million contribution points at Dragon God Valley. It could be exchanged for a pile of treasures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
