They were clearly trying to use this method to force Qiu Hao and Qiu Ying Ying to hand over the inheritance.</p><p>It was fine for him to hand over the treasures, but when he was accepting the inheritance, he had to be completely focused. If he were to forcefully interrupt, it would be extremely dangerous, as it would destroy Qiu Ying Ying. This was something he would never agree to.</p><p>Even if he had to die!</p><p>Qiu Hao stood in front of Qiu Ying Ying with the shield in his hand and the Golden Bell floating above his head.</p><p>“Brat, since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The red-faced young man shouted coldly.</p><p>“Who do you want to help?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice sounded in the hall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a shadow flashed and a figure appeared beside Qiu Hao. His speed was so fast that no one could see how he had appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qiu Hao blurted out subconsciously.</p><p>That’s right, the person who had just appeared was Lu Ming.</p><p>He had been walking around aimlessly in the fortress. Just now, he had arrived here and seen the scene in the hall. He used the wind elemental technique and appeared beside Qiu Hao.</p><p>“Yinfeng? The people from Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Yin Feng and the people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The people of Dragon God Valley stood aside, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s like this …”</p><p>Qiu Hao briefly explained what had happened and Lu Ming immediately understood what had happened.</p><p>“How despicable!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Yin Feng.</p><p>“It’s this kid. Hehe, this time, let’s see how you die.”</p><p>When Yin Feng saw Lu Ming, he was stunned at first, then he revealed a cold smile.</p><p>He was not Lu Ming’s match before he reached the martial Royal realm. However, now that he had reached the martial Royal realm and his spirit body had transformed into a low-grade Earth Spirit body, he was confident that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you want to interfere in this matter?”</p><p>The red-faced young man’s gaze fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“What do you think? If you know what’s good for you, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly.</p><p>“Presumptuous! You want to interfere in this matter alone? you’re courting death! I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The red-faced young man shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, a blood-red sword-light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was a disciple of the blood demon tower, one of the thirteen top sects in the Azure region.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his finger and flicked the blood-red sword radiance away. At the same time, he moved and threw a punch at the red-faced young man.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The red-faced young man’s sword gleam was flicked away by Lu Ming’s finger. He was shocked. He waved the long sword in his hand and dozens of sharp blood-red sword gleams bloomed out, stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s fist force crushed over and the red-faced young man’s sword gleam collapsed. Then, the fist force landed on the red-faced young man’s body. The red-faced young man screamed in pain and his body flew out. His body twitched a few times before he stopped moving. There was no sign of life left in him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch had dispersed the spiritual God in the red-faced young man’s body.</p><p>At the side, the other young men were shocked.</p><p>Killing the red-faced young man with one punch shocked him.</p><p>“Which one of you still wants to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the other young men.</p><p>The young men’s expressions changed.</p><p>let’s attack together. I don’t believe that we can’t kill him with more than a dozen of us working together!</p><p>A young man growled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming appeared beside him and threw a punch. This person was dead!</p><p>“Who else is there?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. His cold killing intent filled the air, causing the remaining young men’s faces to turn ugly.</p><p>innate spirit body, this person must be an innate spirit body. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such strong combat power!</p><p>They growled in their hearts, thinking that Lu Ming had an innate spirit body.</p><p>Once an innate spiritual body broke through to the martial Royal realm, the spiritual body would undergo a transformation. At the very least, it could become a low-grade earth spiritual body. Its combat strength would be so strong that it could completely crush other martial artists of the same level.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>At the side, Yin Feng’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>Lu Ming had also broken through to the Martial Emperor realm and his combat strength was extremely strong.</p><p>However, he didn’t really take it seriously. He could now kill a martial artist of the same level with one move.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>The dozen or so young men’s faces were ugly, but they had no choice but to retreat. However, they only walked to the side and did not leave.</p><p>They could tell that Yin Feng and the others were not on good terms with the qiuhao sisters. They would not give up so easily. Perhaps they could take advantage of the situation later.</p><p>“Why aren’t you guys leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to yinfeng and the rest.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s face was gloomy. He snorted and said, ” “Lu Ming, do you think you can keep these treasures and legacies? It’s best if you hand the treasure over to us. We’ll help you bring it out and hand it over to the sect. ”</p><p>hand it over to the sect. We will hand it over ourselves. You don’t have to worry about it!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that you can be so arrogant just because you’re capable. I’ll test your confidence now to see if you can keep the treasure!”</p><p>Yin Feng stepped forward, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“You’ve been defeated, yet you’re looking for a beating again?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“That was then and this is now. Lu Ming, today, I’ll let you see the difference between you and me!” He said.</p><p>roar! Yin Feng’s body glowed with a silver light and a Dragon’s Roar reverberated through the hall.</p><p>His body glowed with silver light and turned into a Silver Dragon that wrapped around his body.</p><p>Silver Dragon combat body!</p><p>A terrifying spirit body!</p><p>“Silver Dragon Blazing Star fist!”</p><p>die! the silver Dragon roared and charged at Lu Ming like a beam of silver light. The silver Emperor spiritual weapon glove on its fist glowed with a dazzling light.</p><p>As the fist force passed by, the space shook violently.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming casually took a step forward and threw a punch.</p><p>There was nothing unusual about this punch. It was ordinary.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two fists collided like two meteors. The terrifying sound waves caused the hall to rumble.</p><p>Then, a figure retreated.</p><p>It was yinfeng!</p><p>He took seven steps back, and with every step, the hall rumbled as if it was shaking violently.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Disbelief flashed in Yin Feng’s eyes.</p><p>After breaking through to the Emperor level, his spirit body had become a low-grade Earth Spirit body and was extremely powerful. With the addition of his territory and the Emperor spiritual weapon, he thought that he would be able to crush Lu Ming. But now, he was completely at a disadvantage in just one move.</p><p>Moreover, it seemed that Lu Ming had not used his full strength.</p><p>low-class earth spiritual body, you lowly ant, how could you cultivate a low-class earth spiritual body? ”</p><p>Yin Feng roared.</p><p>“You think you’re very noble? Do you think you’re so great with a low-class earth spiritual body? I’ll let you know that even if we’re both low-class earth spiritual bodies, you’re not worth mentioning in front of me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and took a step forward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a single step, the hall rumbled. Lu Ming appeared in front of Yin Feng. His body was like a huge Dragon, twisting and swaying. A powerful force flowed through his arm and he threw a punch.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>die! Yin Feng roared as his aura started to increase.</p><p>The peak of the first level Martial Emperor realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
