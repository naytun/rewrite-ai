Now, there were still people who didn’t want to sign?</p><p>They were completely ignoring him.</p><p>“If you don’t sign it, do you know the consequences?”</p><p>Silver flying badge said coldly.</p><p>the great sovereign secret realm is full of danger. You made us sign the contract that we will be at your command in the great sovereign secret realm. We will become your chess pieces. When you encounter danger, you will let us go first and you will reap the benefits, right? ”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said loudly.</p><p>His words caused many people’s expressions to change drastically.</p><p>That was indeed the case. If Yin Feng and the others were in danger in the great emperor secret realm and they were asked to help, they would be in grave danger. At that time, they wouldn’t even be able to keep their lives, let alone an opportunity.</p><p>Some of the people who had signed the contract turned pale.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Silver flying badge shouted.</p><p>This was their original plan. They had come here to find some scapegoats to work for them in the mystic realm.</p><p>He did not expect that Qiu Ying Ying would directly expose him.</p><p>although your combat strength is strong, we have so many people here. If we work together, why would we be afraid of you? ”</p><p>also, the seniors of Dragon God Valley have summoned us over a vast distance. We haven’t entered the great emperor secret realm yet. I don’t believe you can do anything to us.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said loudly.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s words made Yin Feng, Yin feizhang, and the other two’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>“B * tch, don’t think that I don’t dare to touch you. You’re just an ant. Even if I kill you, what can I do?”</p><p>die! silver flying badge shouted angrily, and he threw a palm at Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s expression changed as she hurriedly retreated.</p><p>However, the silver flying badge was extremely fast, like a green lightning bolt, it quickly blasted towards Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“Little sister!”</p><p>no! Qiu Hao cried out. He wanted to help but it was too late.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of Qiu Ying Ying and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This figure’s punch collided with silver flying badge’s palm, and silver flying badge was forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The figure that suddenly appeared in front of Qiu Ying Ying was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had not made a move.</p><p>Because there was no need for him to do so. He didn’t know anyone else at the scene, so why should he make a move?</p><p>However, now that Qiu Ying Ying was involved, Lu Ming had no choice but to take action.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to attack me?”</p><p>The silver flying badge glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“You dare? Who Do You Think You Are? Why would I not dare? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Hearing this, Yin feizhang’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he revealed a ferocious killing intent and shouted, ” “Die!”</p><p>The silver hook reappeared in his hand and he swept it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He decided to kill Lu Ming as a warning to others.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Nine streams of dragon power burst forth as he activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and punched out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying fist force exploded with an ear-piercing sound, shaking the void.</p><p>Silver flying badge’s expression changed drastically. He felt a terrible force rushing toward him with an unstoppable force. His body trembled violently and he was sent flying backward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Silver flying badge’s body hit the ice wall, and he spat out a mouthful of blood with the sound of bones breaking.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>A series of gasps rang out in the venue.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded as they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually injured the silver flying badge with one punch.</p><p>Just now, the silver flying badge’s combat strength was obvious to all. It was definitely powerful. It had cultivated a domain-type martial arts technique and far exceeded the prodigies of the same level. However, it could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming.</p><p>The contrast was too great.</p><p>It turned out that there was such a powerful person among them.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao were also dumbfounded.</p><p>as expected of a person who has awakened the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s beautiful eyes flashed with a Crystal Light.</p><p>“Ah, brat, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>The silver flying badge roared and struggled to get up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, a figure flashed and Lu Ming appeared in front of silver flying badge. He grabbed silver flying badge’s throat and slammed him against the ice wall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ice wall made a violent sound. Silver flying badge was like a Toad that was hit by a brick. It let out a strange scream and blood flowed out of its mouth and nose.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Do you really think you’re strong? You’re the one who calls others trash and ants. In my eyes, you’re the ant!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The silver flying badge struggled desperately in Lu Ming’s hands, but it was as helpless as a weak little chick.</p><p>“You think you’re superior? You’re just born in the yuan continent and have cultivated the domain martial technique. Apart from the domain martial technique, who else here is worse than you?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>This made many people clench their fists, and their confidence, which had been hit hard, returned.</p><p>That’s right, the silver flying badge only cultivated a domain technique. Its talent might not be better than theirs.</p><p>In the future, if they also practiced and comprehended martial arts techniques, how could they be worse than the silver flying badge?</p><p>It was just a temporary advantage.</p><p>These people were the top geniuses of their respective continents. They had tough minds and quickly regained their confidence.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely cold voice came from behind Lu Ming.</p><p>It was yinfeng!</p><p>At this moment, Yin Feng’s body was covered in a layer of silver light. Even his eyes were flashing with silver light. A bone-piercing killing intent was emitted from his body.</p><p>Lu Ming clasped Yin feizhang’s neck and turned to look at Yin Feng with a faint smile.</p><p>you’re quite bold, and your combat strength is not bad. However, since you’ve been so arrogant the moment you came to Dragon God Valley, you’ll have a miserable ending!</p><p>Yin Feng said coldly. He looked at Lu Ming as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p>“Arrogant? Hehe, so you’re saying that I’m going to be bullied by you and I can’t even resist. If I resist, it’s called arrogance. Is that the logic of a pig?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Yin Feng’s face turned even colder and his killing intent was bone-chilling, ” “From the moment you said those words, you’re dead. No one can save you!”</p><p>“Oh? Was it? I don’t know how many people have said this to me since I started cultivating, but in the end, they all became dead fish. I hope you won’t be the next one!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to those ants you’ve met!”</p><p>Yin Feng said.</p><p>hehe, in my eyes, you’re not even as good as an ant. Also, there’s no need to keep this blood oath contract!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the silver flying badge far away and held the blood oath contract in his hand.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>“I’m so scared!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His essential core burst forth and the blood oath contract turned into ashes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
