However, when he realized that Lu Ming was cultivating, his face revealed a look of surprise and ferocity.</p><p>“It’s this brat, even senior brother liuyan wasn’t his match. But it’s really a blessing from the heavens, this brat is currently cultivating. Haha, as long as I kill this brat, the Holy maiden will definitely look at me in a new light!”</p><p>...</p><p>The young man was overjoyed. His vital essence burst forth and he struck out a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was still cultivating and seemed to have forgotten himself.</p><p>The terrifying palm force neared Lu Ming in an instant. At that moment, Lu Ming’s body was filled with chaotic light and his chaotic domain bloomed outward on its own.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man’s palm landed on the chaotic domain, and his body shook violently. His expression changed drastically, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He was sent flying.</p><p>He flew directly out of the entrance of the ancient cave mansion and fell on the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>No one would be in a good mood if they were interrupted at a critical moment in their cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, appearing outside the cave abode.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao were overjoyed.</p><p>At first, they were extremely worried when they saw the other person rush into the cave abode, but they could do nothing about it. Now that they saw Lu Ming coming out unscathed, they heaved a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The young man outside felt his heart skip a beat when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ming from afar when he was transcending the Tribulation. They were terrified to see him now.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without a second thought, they turned and ran. The young man who was injured by Lu Ming did the same.</p><p>“Where do you want to go? Come back!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was in the air and he suddenly sucked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying devouring force burst out from Lu Ming’s palm and enveloped the two young men from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The other party was originally flying forward at high speed, but after being enveloped by the devouring power, his figure seemed to be fixed in place. Then, he was directly pulled back by the devouring power.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The two of them roared and attacked with all their might, trying to break the devouring power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and the chaos realm pressed down.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two of them trembled and spat out mouthfuls of blood as they were pulled back by the devouring power.</p><p>Moreover, their blood essence, essential core, and fresh blood were rapidly flowing away and flying into Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“No, spare my life!”</p><p>This situation made the two of them scream in fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved. The devouring power continued to erupt.</p><p>In just half the time it took to brew a cup of tea, the two young men had turned into two dried corpses.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao both gasped.</p><p>Firstly, they were shocked by Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>The two young men of the tianshen sect had both passed the martial Royal ordeal and entered the martial Royal realm. Moreover, they had both cultivated domain martial techniques and had powerful combat strength. The Qiu family’s brother and sister could not defeat one of them even if they joined forces.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s hands, the other party could not fight back at all. Lu Ming had killed the two of them without even moving a step.</p><p>The second reason was that he was shocked at Lu Ming’s overbearing methods. He directly devoured people and turned them into mummies.</p><p>After devouring their blood essence, Lu Ming began to refine them.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had become a Martial Emperor, he had cultivated the Dragon God combat body and devoured the refining power. He was much stronger than before.</p><p>Very soon, the blood essence energy of both of them was almost completely refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>“As expected, it’s not of much use!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head secretly.</p><p>The devoured energy was still useful in increasing true Yuan and condensing spirit bodies, but it had no effect on improving his territory.</p><p>A domain was different from a concept.</p><p>Intent realm. It has intent realm runes that can be devoured and refined. It can be fused into one’s own intent realm runes to increase one’s own intent realm.</p><p>However, a domain was even more wondrous. It did not have a physical form and was just a form of comprehension of the martial artist. It was ethereal and naturally could not be devoured and refined.</p><p>Therefore, one had to rely on their own comprehension to break through the domain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>He only needed to focus on his domain. His true essence could still be improved by devouring the refining power. This was a huge advantage compared to others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying stepped forward and asked.</p><p>“I’m fine. What about you guys?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“We’re only slightly injured. We’ll be fine after we adjust our breathing!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can continue cultivating. We’ll protect you!”</p><p>Qiu Hao said.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and said, ” there’s no need. The heavenly Dao mark is not too profound. I’ve already comprehended most of it. If I continue to comprehend it, I won’t be able to gain much in a short period of time. You guys should recuperate first!</p><p>After some comprehension, his Chaos Domain had improved a little. Not only was it completely stable, but it also seemed to have reached the middle stage of level one.</p><p>There were nine levels of domains. Lu Ming could only break through to the second level of the Dao Martial Emperor realm if he cultivated the chaos Domain to level two.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao sat down cross-legged, took a healing pill, and began to heal.</p><p>Two hours later, both of their injuries were almost fully recovered. The three of them did not stay any longer and soared into the sky, flying forward.</p><p>Along the way, they came across some other buildings or cave abodes, but they were all one step ahead. The three of them did not stop and kept moving forward.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a vast land.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was a huge building complex in front of them.</p><p>Huge palaces stood on a plain. From a distance, Lu Ming and the rest could see silhouettes flickering in the palaces. Many people were exploring the area.</p><p>such a large group of buildings … Could it be the emperor’s bedroom? even if it’s not, it must be the residence of an important figure. There must be some treasures!</p><p>Qiu Hao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Let’s go down and try our luck!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. The three of them descended and landed in front of a huge Hall.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; an astonishing boom erupted within the palace. The three of them walked up and saw two youths engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The ground was covered with corpses and blood that had yet to dry up.</p><p>“Hand over the treasure!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted and launched a crazy attack on the other young man.</p><p>don’t even think about it. Treasures belong to those who are fated to obtain them. Since I’ve obtained them, it means that I’m fated to obtain them!</p><p>Another young man shouted.</p><p>“Bullsh * t, I’ll kill you and the treasure will be mine!”</p><p>The man from before shouted.</p><p>The two of them fought so fiercely that the palace was cracked and shattered.</p><p>It was obvious that a treasure had appeared here and everyone was fighting for it. The corpses here were all heaven’s favorites who had entered this place, but now, they were all dead.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look elsewhere!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. The three of them turned around and left for the other halls.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Suddenly, a group of people flew out from a Palace. There were more than a hundred of them. They were all young men who had come in. Their faces were pale.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>“Quickly run!”</p><p>The young men shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dense inscriptions suddenly appeared in the palace, and then a large array appeared. A black light cut through the void and stabbed toward the youths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
