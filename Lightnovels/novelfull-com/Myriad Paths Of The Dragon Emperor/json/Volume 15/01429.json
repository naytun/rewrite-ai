He twisted his body and stepped forward, moving tens of meters to the top of the landing zone.</p><p>Immediately after, Luo Xiang also flew over.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Luo Xiang, it was Wang Xiao’s turn. He landed on the ground and looked at Lu Ming with a dark expression.</p><p>As the leader of jiuxiao sword sect’s expedition into the secret realm, he had just been kicked down by Lu Ming, an unknown person. This made his expression turn ugly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze was attracted to the front.</p><p>In front of him, there were three balls of light floating in the air.</p><p>A book was floating in one of the balls of light. It seemed to be made of gold, but it wasn’t. What was strange was that on the surface of the book, there was a figure dancing with a sword. It was a very mysterious sight.</p><p>It was a martial technique, a sword technique.</p><p>The second ball of light only had a sword. The sword was snow-white, and with just a glance, one could feel a terrifying sword light slashing out.</p><p>A holy weapon!</p><p>This sword was definitely a powerful holy weapon.</p><p>The third ball of light was much simpler. There were only a hundred fist-sized stones.</p><p>The heavenly Dao stone!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The three of them moved almost at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming pounced toward the heavenly Dao stone!</p><p>To Lu Ming, the swordsmanship secret manual was not of much use to him. He was not a swordsman and did not cultivate the sword.</p><p>As for the Saint weapon longsword, although it was precious, it wasn’t of much use to him. If he were to take it out, he would only be selling it.</p><p>These were not as attractive as the heavenly Dao stone.</p><p>The heavenly Dao stone was the root of improving one’s strength. As long as one had strength, would one need to worry about not having treasures?</p><p>Lu Ming pounced toward the heavenly stone’s light sphere, Luo Xiang pounced toward the art of swordplay, and Wang Xiao pounced toward his holy weapon sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the ball of light. The ball of light shook but did not break.</p><p>“It really has a protective function!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Following that, the chaos realm covered Lu Ming’s palm. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck the ball of light with his palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ball of light shook violently. Although it didn’t break, the light from the ball of light dimmed.</p><p>Continue!</p><p>Lu Ming launched a series of attacks. The chaos realm combined with the prison-suppressing heavenly technique was extremely powerful. The ball of light shook continuously and flickered.</p><p>In less than ten breaths, Lu Ming had struck more than a hundred times. Finally, the ball of light collapsed with a poof, turning into light spots and disappearing. Lu Ming grabbed down and put more than a hundred heavenly Dao stones into his storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had a smile on his face.</p><p>In total, he had obtained more than two hundred heavenly Dao stones. The heavenly Dao stones were so precious that even sage realm experts would want to look for them. They would be envious if they saw them. Lu Ming’s trip to the great emperor secret realm this time was not in vain.</p><p>After putting away the heavenly Dao stone, he looked around and found that Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao still hadn’t broken through the light.</p><p>Sword light burst out from their hands and continuously slashed at the ball of light. The ball of light trembled and its light dimmed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile as he pounced towards the ball of light Wang Xiao was in. He struck out with his palm, causing the ball of light to tremble violently.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared in anger.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered with him and struck out with his palm.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to fight me for my Saint weapon? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wang Xiao hollered in rage, and the sword in his hand flashed as he slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked out. This kick was also a combination of the prison suppressing heaven technique and the chaos Domain.</p><p>Wang Xiao’s sword light was shattered, and his body was forced back two steps.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck the ball of light with his palm again.</p><p>With a poof, the ball of light was destroyed. Lu Ming grabbed the Holy weapon longsword and kept it in his storage ring.</p><p>“Brat, hand over your Saint weapon!”</p><p>Wang Xiao let out a furious roar as he pounced towards Lu Ming, his sword Qi shooting towards Lu Ming like a rainbow.</p><p>“You want a Saint weapon? let’s see if you have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Wang Xiao had attacked Lu Ming the moment he entered the room. Now that he had the chance to snatch a Saint weapon, how could Lu Ming be polite?</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a blade, slashing down continuously. Under Lu Ming’s palm, Wang Xiao’s sword radiance was destroyed one after another.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Xiao was so angry that he was about to vomit blood. However, he was shocked to find that he could not do anything to Lu Ming at all. In fact, Lu Ming’s attacks were stronger than his, but he was actually being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands, bringing with it his Chaos Domain. In an instant, he sent out a dozen palm strikes, which were like a dozen mountains, pressing down on Wang Xiao.</p><p>Wang Xiao raised his cultivation to the peak of the second level of the Martial Emperor realm, and a sword light burst forth as he tried to break out of the mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, and the sword Qi was extinguished. Wang Xiao used all his strength and finally managed to break through the gap, rushing out of Lu Ming’s attack range. He retreated far away, feeling the qi and blood in his body churning. He looked at Lu Ming with a serious expression.</p><p>At this time, Luo Xiang also broke through the light ball and put away the Kendo manual.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Wang Xiao was so depressed that he almost vomited blood. Originally, there were three of them, so there were exactly three treasures. But in the end, Lu Ming got two, and he did not get a share.</p><p>That was a holy weapon. If he could refine one or two of them, his combat power would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was in Lu Ming’s hands now.</p><p>He glared at Lu Ming viciously.</p><p>“What, you want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Wang Xiao with a murderous look in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, not far in front of the three of them, a spot of light suddenly lit up in the space. The spot of light was resplendent, and slowly, a small sword appeared there.</p><p>The small sword was only the size of a palm, but it was bright and resplendent. The light was like tiny little swords, spreading in all directions.</p><p>Legacy!</p><p>The three men’s hearts moved, and their eyes bloomed with a fiery light. Almost at the same time, the three of them moved and pounced toward the light sword.</p><p>However, the next moment, the three of them changed their expressions and pushed forward with their palms. Then, the three of them retreated in unison.</p><p>what a strong pressure! What a strong sword Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were a little solemn.</p><p>The moment he charged out, he felt a powerful sword Qi emanating from the Sword of Light, as if it was going to tear him apart. If he had not blocked it in time, he would have been injured.</p><p>Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao were probably the same.</p><p>It seemed that it would not be easy to get this light sword.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming covered his entire body with the chaos Domain and walked forward step by step.</p><p>The chaotic realm rippled as it was attacked. Tiny sword Qi, dense and endless, stabbed the chaotic realm.</p><p>As for Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao, they also stepped forward. Of course, they were also attacked, and were doing their best to resist.</p><p>The speed of the three of them became extremely slow.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain covered his entire body. Step by step, he walked forward determinedly. His speed was still faster than Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was several meters ahead of Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
