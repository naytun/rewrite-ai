Wang Xiao, on the other hand, was furious. He gritted his teeth and charged forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>...</p><p>There was a whooshing sound and four figures rushed up from the bottom of the sword Pagoda. They were the four young men who had competed with Lu Ming for the Royal fruit.</p><p>“It’s an inheritance!”</p><p>“The legacy of the sword pagodas!”</p><p>When they saw the light swords, their eyes flashed with greed and they also stepped forward.</p><p>But at the same time, they were also attacked by the sword Qi, and their speed was slower than a snail.</p><p>“The power of the sword Qi is getting stronger and stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression slowly turned serious.</p><p>The further he went, the closer he was to the light sword. The pressure and the power of the sword Qi became stronger and stronger.</p><p>The ripples on the chaos Domain also became more and more intense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used offense as a form of defense and began to use the prison suppressing heaven technique to break the sword Qi.</p><p>In this case, it was indeed better. Lu Ming’s speed suddenly increased.</p><p>Seeing this, Luo Xiang and Wang Xiao also started to attack. Sword Qi burst out from their hands, clashing with the sword Qi that was flying towards them, causing a dense clashing sound to ring out.</p><p>However, their speed was still not as fast as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>The lightsaber was not far away from them to begin with. In a short while, Lu Ming was already close to the lightsaber. He was less than a meter away from it. He could reach it with his hand.</p><p>At this point, the power of the sword Qi light had reached a shocking level.</p><p>“Detestable, no!”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared in his heart. Seeing that the legacy was about to be taken by Lu Ming, he was extremely unwilling.</p><p>He tried his best to move forward, but it was impossible for him to get close to the light sword.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He covered his palm with the chaos Domain and grabbed the light sword, successfully grabbing it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, the light sword trembled slightly, and the light grew brighter. A terrifying sword Qi burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt that the chaos Domain on his palm could not withstand the pressure and was about to break.</p><p>A terrifying sword Qi burst out of Lu Ming’s palm and headed straight for him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body could not help but retreat after being hit by the sword Qi. He slid along the ground for dozens of meters.</p><p>He had failed!</p><p>The lightsaber did not acknowledge him!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. He was not too surprised.</p><p>The inheritance here was obviously a sword technique inheritance. He did not cultivate the sword, so it was normal for him to be rejected by the light sword.</p><p>Previously, he had only wanted to give it a try.</p><p>Even if he could not get the legacy, Lu Ming had a fruitful trip.</p><p>The three Royal fruits and more than a hundred heavenly Dao stones were extremely useful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, there was also a Holy battle sword, which was also very valuable.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming being pushed back by the lightsaber, Wang Xiao laughed in his heart and pushed forward with all his might.</p><p>He and Luo Xiang approached the light sword almost at the same time.</p><p>“Luo Xiang, you want to compete with me? dream on!”</p><p>A small squirrel appeared in Wang Xiao’s hands.</p><p>“Sword rats!”</p><p>Luo Xiang’s expression changed.</p><p>“Go, attack him!”</p><p>Wang Xiao spoke, staring at Luo Xiang.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The squirrel cried out in fear.</p><p>“Wang Xiao, this place is filled with powerful sword Qi. If you ask the swordmouse to attack me, you’ll be killing it!”</p><p>Luo Xiang said.</p><p>“Hmph, hurry up and attack, or I’ll kill you right now!”</p><p>Wang Xiao couldn’t be bothered with Luo Xiang’s words, and stared at the sword rat with killing intent.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The sword rat was so scared that its body trembled. It then nodded, and a look of sorrow flashed through its eyes. With a swish, it rushed towards Luo Xiang.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang was the same as Wang Xiao, he had to use all of his strength to block the sword Qi, and couldn’t even spare a hand to attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword rat struck Luo Xiang’s protective Zhen Yuan and domain, causing his body to shake and retreat.</p><p>But the sword rat was also exposed to the endless sword Qi.</p><p>The sword rat wailed and turned into ashes under the sword Qi.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve finally seized the initiative!”</p><p>Wang Xiao laughed as he reached out to grab the Sword of Light.</p><p>“The inheritance is mine!”</p><p>Wang Xiao grabbed the Sword of Light, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>Of course, he could tell that Lu Ming was repelled by the lightsaber because he was not a swordsman. Naturally, he could not be recognized by the lightsaber.</p><p>However, he was a pure swordsman. He had been practicing swordsmanship since young and was a famous genius in the jiuxiao sword sect. How could he not be recognized by the light sword?</p><p>However, the next moment, his eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>The lightsaber burst forth with a violent force, and just like Lu Ming, Wang Xiao was sent flying.</p><p>“No, how could this be?”</p><p>Wang Xiao couldn’t believe it, and he howled in rage.</p><p>He had also been rejected by the lightsaber. How could this be?</p><p>“Sword cultivators are supposed to be brave, determined, decisive, persistent, sharp, and daring. But you, you’re despicable and shameless. Wang Xiao, you’re not worthy of a sword!”</p><p>Luo Xiang’s indifferent voice sounded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, Luo Xiang took a few steps forward and arrived in front of the light sword. Without any hesitation, he grabbed the light sword.</p><p>When Luo Xiang grabbed the lightsaber, it was surprisingly quiet. The powerful sword Qi disappeared without a trace, just like a docile pet.</p><p>“Luo Xiang has obtained the recognition of the lightsaber!”</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>impossible! The inheritance is mine!</p><p>Wang Xiao couldn’t accept this fact, and with a roar of anger, he pounced towards Luo Xiang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Sword of Light trembled, and a powerful sword Qi burst forth, sending Wang Xiao flying.</p><p>Then, with a flash, the light sword entered the space between Luo Xiang’s eyebrows and disappeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Luo Xiang directly jumped down from the sword Pagoda and rushed out.</p><p>At this moment, the sword Pagoda began to shake.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming jumped down from the sword Pagoda and rushed out of the pagoda. The others followed suit, one by one, including Wang Xiao. However, his face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Pagoda trembled. Then, a Rainbow Bridge broke through the sky and rushed into the boundless void, merging with the other two rainbow bridges.</p><p>In the distance, a sword light flashed and flew into the distance. It was Luo Xiang. He had just received the inheritance and needed time to digest it.</p><p>“Luo Xiang, don’t even think about occupying the sword doctrine inheritance!”</p><p>Wang Xiao’s eyes flashed with a cold light, as he turned into a beam of sword light, chasing after Luo Xiang.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. Wang Xiao was a narrow-minded person. No wonder he couldn’t get the sword Dao inheritance. Compared to Luo Xiang, he was far worse.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with this matter and stepped out.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming rushed past the area of the sword’s tail plate and went back the way he came.</p><p>Lu Ming was not very concerned about the legacy here.</p><p>He had the inheritances of the nine Dragons and the chaos Thearch. The nine Dragons and the chaos Thearch were peak experts in the world. They were peak existences even among the great emperors. Lu Ming did not care about these small inheritances at all.</p><p>Even if he obtained it, it would not be of much use to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted more treasures, such as the heavenly Dao stone, which was of great use to him.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming found Qiu Yingying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s the legacy?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying asked curiously.</p><p>They had just seen the Rainbow Bridge and knew that the inheritance had already appeared. They were just curious about who had taken it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
