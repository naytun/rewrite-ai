At this moment, he kowtowed without any hesitation and said loudly, ” “Junior is willing to join senior and the evil spirit cult!”</p><p>“The evil spirit Holy Church?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>He had never heard of this force before, so why was Xu long so terrified when he heard this name?</p><p>Xu Long’s fear came from the depths of his heart. It was not an act. It meant that Xu long was really terrified when he heard the name evil spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the evil spirit sect might be a big sect outside of the Azure region.</p><p>“Hehe, at least you know what’s good for you. Relax!”</p><p>The skeletal elder sneered. A ray of black light shot out from his brow and disappeared into Xu Kong’s body.</p><p>Xu Long’s face immediately showed respect to the skeletal elder. “Your subordinate Xu long will definitely die for you in the future!”</p><p>“Kid, what about you? Why don’t you relax your mind and join this old man? as long as you help this old man trick more people, this old man will definitely reward you heavily in the future!”</p><p>The skeletal old man said.</p><p>“He’s willing to be your Lackey, but I’m not in the mood!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“What did you just say? Brat, you’re seeking your own death!”</p><p>The skeletal old man coldly shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, you don’t have to scare me. From what I see, you don’t have much strength left, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the skeletal elder and said.</p><p>The skeletal old man’s expression changed slightly. boy, I’m indeed injured, but I can easily deal with a mere Martial Emperor!</p><p>“Oh, really? In my opinion, it’s more like a fox exploiting the Tiger’s might. When we first came in, you shouted and killed Duan Yan and her companion. That method should have directly destroyed their souls, and then you deliberately released the aura of the Saint realm to frighten us!”</p><p>“But if you really have the strength of the sage realm, why do you need to do this? It was too deliberate for you to release the aura of the sage realm. Moreover, you needed the Feng family head to lure us here. So, in my opinion, you can’t use that kind of method too much, or else your injury will worsen. Also, you can’t leave this place, or your injury will worsen. Am I right?”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated slowly and explained.</p><p>The skeletal old man’s gaze changed.</p><p>Xu Long’s face also changed.</p><p>damn it. This Lu Ming knows so much. Why didn’t he say it earlier!</p><p>Xu long roared in his heart.</p><p>If Lu Ming had told him earlier, he would not have joined the skeletal elder. He might have escaped if he had taken the risk.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re very meticulous, but you still have to die. Xu long, kill him!”</p><p>The skeletal old man instructed.</p><p>Xu Long’s expression changed. He had no confidence in dealing with Lu Ming.</p><p>elder, although this person’s cultivation base is weak, but …</p><p>Xu long wanted to explain.</p><p>“Kill him, kill! Kill!”</p><p>The skeletal old man coldly shouted. Xu long let out a miserable shriek as if he was suffering from endless pain.”Elder, please spare my life. I will kill him now!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The skeletal old man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>In the next moment, Xu long pounced on Lu Ming with a ferocious look in his eyes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword radiance bloomed from Xu Long’s long sword and was aimed at Lu Ming’s vital points.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few consecutive punches and broke Xu Long’s sword gleam.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s the point of resisting? you’re destined to die. Even if you escape back to Dragon God Valley, you’ll still die. Yin Feng won’t let you off!”</p><p>Xu long roared.</p><p>“You were indeed sent by yinfeng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>Xu long had been hiding his cultivation level. When Lu Ming and the Feng family head were fighting, he stood by and watched. Lu Ming had already suspected that Xu long wanted to kill him with a borrowed knife.</p><p>It seemed that it was true.</p><p>I was looking for an opportunity to kill you when you’re not prepared. Haha, but it’s the same to kill you now!</p><p>Xu long seemed to have gone crazy as he launched a storm of attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>He had already surrendered to the evil spirit elder. This matter must not be spread. Otherwise, he would die without a doubt. Therefore, Lu Ming must die.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s third bloodline appeared and a surge of energy surged into his body.</p><p>Then, his Primal Chaos Domain burst forth, and he used the prison suppressing heavenly art to punch Xu long.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This punch directly broke through all of Xu Long’s defenses. The terrifying fist force bombarded Xu Long’s chest.</p><p>Half of his body exploded in the air and he flew far away.</p><p>Apart from a few of his trump cards, this punch was almost Lu Ming’s full strength. It was enough to kill a Lv 4 Martial Emperor. Xu long could not withstand it at all.</p><p>After killing Xu long with a single move, Lu Ming’s Black wings appeared. With a flap, he dashed toward the entrance of the tunnel at top speed.</p><p>Primal Chaos Domain, it’s actually the primal Chaos Domain. I didn’t expect that a genius who has comprehended the primal Chaos Domain would appear in the tiny Azure region. Kill, we must kill him!</p><p>The skeletal elder’s eyes were filled with killing intent, and a black light appeared on his forehead.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The skeletal elder suddenly roared. A black ray of light instantly cut through the void and appeared behind Lu Ming, shooting toward him.</p><p>Its speed was unbelievably fast, as if it was teleporting.</p><p>Lu Ming turned pale with fright. He wanted to Dodge but it was too late.</p><p>The ray of light passed through the chaos realm and shot into Lu Ming’s body, heading straight for the spiritual God.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The ray of light landed on the spiritual God. The Jade armor on the spiritual God emitted a bright light and formed a light screen, blocking the black light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body only trembled slightly as he continued to rush outward at high speed.</p><p>a spiritual God defensive treasure. There’s actually such a rare treasure. Damn it, we can’t let this person escape!</p><p>The skeletal old man growled. Cracking sounds came from his body as he floated into the air. He was like a skeleton that had been sitting cross-legged for thousands of years.</p><p>“Elder, help me release my cultivation, and I’ll help you hunt down that brat!”</p><p>The Feng family head called out from the side.</p><p>“There’s no point in keeping a piece of trash like you. Die!”</p><p>The skeletal old man’s eyes were filled with a cold light. He opened his mouth and sucked, and a layer of black light enveloped the Feng family head. The Feng family head suddenly let out a miserable scream, and his body shriveled up at a speed visible to the naked eye, turning into a dry corpse.</p><p>Xu Long’s, Duan Yan’s, and Fu Xing’s corpses had also turned into mummies. Their flesh and blood essence had all been devoured by the old man. At this time, his skin had a slight luster.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He shouted in a low voice and turned into a black light, rushing out of the cave in pursuit of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming flew out of the cave. The energy of the air-frozen bead gushed in. He cast the wind element art and flew wildly into the distance with the black wings.</p><p>However, he didn’t fly very far before he heard a shocking sound behind him. A black ray of light flew over at high speed.</p><p>this old man actually wants to kill me without caring about his injuries!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. He flew at his maximum speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
