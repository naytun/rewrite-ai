Through the collapsing void, he could vaguely see two figures fighting in the outer space. It was as if it was a projection and it was very magical.</p><p>...</p><p>Two huge figures were fighting in the starry sky, and the space was collapsing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the towering figure roared into the sky and transformed into a giant heavenly bull. Its two horns were like two divine blades.</p><p>The towering figure’s true form was actually a huge heavenly bull.</p><p>The sky bull stepped in the air, and with every step, the space collapsed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The heavenly bull roared and the space turned into chaos. Lu Ming even saw the stars in the sky explode like fireworks.</p><p>Lu Ming sucked in a breath of cold air. It was too terrifying. With a roar, the stars exploded. What kind of terrifying combat strength was this?</p><p>Could human strength really reach such a level?</p><p>Lu Ming felt that with the towering figure’s combat strength, it could probably completely wipe out a continent like the divine wilderness continent in one move. One move could make the divine wilderness continent disappear from the world.</p><p>This level of combat strength had exceeded Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>is this the fighting power of a great emperor? but even Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul weren’t this terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>kid, what do you know? even though we’re all great emperors, there’s a huge difference in our battle strength. When I was at my peak, I could kill a bunch of ordinary great emperors with one slap!</p><p>Dandan said with a smug face.</p><p>Lu Ming was skeptical about her words.</p><p>Lu Ming believed that there was a huge difference in combat strength even though they were both great emperors.</p><p>However, ordinary great emperors weren’t that weak.</p><p>When he first saw Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul, it was because the two of them were too severely injured. Furthermore, they had been fighting against each other for sixty thousand years and were already extremely weak.</p><p>Otherwise, Emperor Cang wouldn’t have been able to turn the tide of the battle with the help of an absolute Saint lightning cauldron.</p><p>If Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul were at their peak, they would definitely be extremely terrifying.</p><p>The heavenly bull roared and shattered the stars. The tentacles behind the three-eyed creature also exploded.</p><p>Then, the heavenly bull stomped on the sky. Its two horns turned into two heavenly blades and slashed out. Two pitch-black blade marks appeared in the universe. From a distance, it looked as if the entire universe had been split.</p><p>The three-eyed creature roared as it wielded two battle axes to fight against the two heavenly blades. The space around it was constantly being destroyed.</p><p>If that terrifying attack were to land on the ground, it would definitely be a scene of the heavens collapsing and the earth shattering.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two terrifying existences had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>But in the end, the heavenly bull’s combat power was stronger.</p><p>The heavenly bull stomped in the air and destroyed all of the opponent’s defenses. It crashed into the opponent’s body, blasting a big hole in it. Then, the heavenly blade formed by the horns came down and cut off the opponent’s head.</p><p>But even so, the three-eyed creature still didn’t die. It waved its giant axe and left a deep wound on the heavenly bull’s body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The heavenly bull let out a loud roar, and the void collapsed, turning into primitive chaos. Cracks appeared on the three-eyed creature’s body, and black liquid flowed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>roar! the heavenly bull roared again. The three-eyed creature finally couldn’t take it anymore, and its body exploded in the air.</p><p>But even so, the other party was not dead. His two huge arms held the giant axe and continued to slash at the heavenly bull.</p><p>The broken flesh and blood, as well as the severed head, wriggled rapidly and quickly fused together, trying to be restored.</p><p>How could the heavenly bull let his opponent have his way? he stepped forward in the air, and his body glowed. This was the power of the great path. The terrifying law of the great path enveloped his opponent and began to refine him.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The three-eyed creature’s flesh and blood seemed to be engulfed in flames as it was being refined continuously, turning into black smoke that dissipated.</p><p>you can’t stop my realm. You’re just a defeated Army who’s struggling at death’s door …</p><p>arghh! the severed head roared as the third eye shot out a beam of destruction at the heavenly bull, but it was destroyed.</p><p>the heaven realm is going to be destroyed, and the primordial realm won’t be spared either. You’re just struggling on your deathbed. When our realm opens up the great road and the great army strikes, you’ll all be annihilated …</p><p>The head let out another roar.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The two heavenly blades slashed down, splitting the giant head in half. The laws of the great Dao condensed, and the three-eyed creature turned into black smoke and dissipated.</p><p>“My realm and my clan will take revenge for me …”</p><p>After a few hours, the three-eyed creature was finally refined. The giant heavenly bull turned back into a human. It stepped out and reappeared under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>An earth-shattering battle had come to an end. However, Lu Ming was shocked and could not calm down.</p><p>Such an existence should be a peak expert in the world, right?</p><p>It was truly a world-shattering thought. In a fit of anger, millions of corpses would fall. It was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>tsk, this old bull can’t take it anymore. It took so long to kill such an enemy. It seems that he was also injured in the battle back then!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched as he muttered.</p><p>Such a terrifying combat power was still not enough?</p><p>“Hey, old bull, long time no see. Did you miss me?”</p><p>Dandan shouted at the towering figure.</p><p>The towering figure looked at dandan and a rumbling voice came out, ” “You old turtle, you’re still alive! You’re quite lucky!”</p><p>hahaha, old bull, you’re not dead yet. Who am I? how can I die so easily? old bull, it’s been years since we last met. Give me a gift. What Emperor’s medicine? give me a hundred or so to use first. Or eight or ten Emperor weapons will do!</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This guy really knew how to demand an exorbitant price.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was also looking forward to it. He thought that if the towering figure really gave dandan a few stalks of Emperor’s medicine, he must find a way to get some.</p><p>The towering figure seemed to smile. With a wave of his hand, a ball of light flew through the air.</p><p>However, the ray of light was not flying towards dandan but towards bubbles at an unbelievable speed. In an instant, it had arrived before bubbles.</p><p>Lu Ming did not see what it was clearly. The bubble opened its mouth and swallowed the ball of light in one gulp. It had a look of enjoyment.</p><p>time and space spinel? old bull, you are really generous. What about mine? where are my treasures? ”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The towering figure said.</p><p>hey, wait, my treasure! You old bull, you value your lover over your friends. Are you taking revenge on me for being more handsome than you …</p><p>Dandan cursed and jabbered on.</p><p>The towering figure waved his hand and an invisible force surged. Lu Ming felt his body tighten. Then, he saw the surrounding scenery flash past him like a fleeting shadow. In the next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had already left the dark land and was standing on a mountain peak.</p><p>“Revenge, revenge, this old bull is definitely taking revenge. Damn it, he didn’t give me anything …”</p><p>Dandan was still cursing and swearing before she looked at bubbles with envy and jealousy. it’s over. After getting the time and space spinel, this little guy’s cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds. He’ll definitely leave me far behind. That old bull really values women!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
