Most of the hundred or so people had their bodies pierced by the black light. They fell to the ground, screaming, and no longer made any sound.</p><p>...</p><p>Only a dozen or so people managed to escape with their lives.</p><p>All of a sudden, nearly a hundred people died.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that out of the nearly one hundred people, half of them had already passed the Martial Emperor’s calamity and become martial emperors. The rest were still at the Supreme-level, but they had all died in an instant.</p><p>The great emperor secret realm was indeed not simple. There was danger at all times.</p><p>Not only would they have to face the attacks of others, but the process of exploring would also be dangerous.</p><p>“I just saw someone sitting cross-legged inside!”</p><p>indeed, there seems to be someone there, but there’s no sign of life. He’s already dead!</p><p>“There’s definitely a treasure!”</p><p>The remaining ten or so people didn’t leave, but lingered around.</p><p>this is an array, but it’s no longer complete after so many years. If we find a gap, we might be able to enter!</p><p>A young man who cultivated the Dao of inscription glanced around, trying to find a flaw in the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming did the same as he scanned the surroundings of the hall.</p><p>Although the clone had not recovered and Lu Ming could not inscribe the formation, he shared the knowledge of the clone. In other words, the main body had the knowledge and vision of the clone. Even if he could not break the formation, he could still find the flaws.</p><p>“You guys follow me closely!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>Then, he strode forward, with Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao following closely behind him.</p><p>On the other side, the other young men also began to move, looking for the flaws in the formation and stepping in.</p><p>“Lu Ming, so you know about the Dao of inscription, but I don’t feel your mental energy fire. Strange!”</p><p>As they walked, Qiu Ying Ying sized Lu Ming up curiously. She found it rather strange.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>The three of them walked in circles, and after a while, they finally passed through the formation and entered the hall.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>In the hall, there was a person sitting cross-legged.</p><p>It was a woman who looked to be in her forties. Unfortunately, she had no life force. It was obvious that she was a corpse.</p><p>could this be someone from the great emperor secret realm? Emperor Cang has been missing for 60000 years. Could this person have died 60000 years ago? ”</p><p>Qiu Hao guessed.</p><p>Their hearts trembled. If this person had died 60000 years ago and his body hadn’t rotted yet, then his cultivation must be shockingly high.</p><p>A Saint!</p><p>The three of them thought at the same time that only a Saint realm expert could maintain his body for so many years without rotting. Otherwise, even a peak Emperor’s body would have rotted after 60000 years.</p><p>“How did this person die? There’s no wound at all!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>After a careful examination, he did not find any wounds on the other party’s body.</p><p>his storage ring is also gone. Could it be that he was killed and his storage ring was taken away? but why aren’t there any wounds? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and could not figure it out.</p><p>The few of them looked around. There were some chairs and tables in the hall, but after so many years, they had already rotted and turned into ashes.</p><p>In the end, their gazes fell on the woman.</p><p>She was wearing a purple feather dress, which was obviously a Supreme treasure. Even after so many years, it was still shining with spiritual light.</p><p>This was definitely a valuable treasure. It was worn by a Saint, so it was very likely a Saint weapon.</p><p>Holy weapon! Their eyes lit up.</p><p>At this moment, footsteps were heard, and a few young men rushed in.</p><p>The moment they entered, their gazes fell on the woman.</p><p>holy weapon! This is definitely a holy weapon! Its value is immeasurable!</p><p>The few young men’s eyes were burning with passion. Then, their gazes landed on Lu Ming and the rest, and a ferocious look flashed across their faces.</p><p>“How about we kill these people and split them equally?”</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The few young men charged at Lu Ming and the rest at the same time, unleashing all sorts of powerful techniques.</p><p>These people were all very powerful. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to escape from the formation. When they attacked together, their power was astonishing.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He took a step forward, and a violent aura emanated from his body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch out, and his fist force streaked across the void. The attacks of the few youths were unable to withstand a single blow from Lu Ming’s fist force and instantly collapsed.</p><p>The fist force didn’t stop and continued to bombard the few young men.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically. They wanted to Dodge, but it was too late. Their screams were drowned out by the fist force. When the fist force disappeared, Lu Ming had already pierced through the bodies of the few young men and they died on the spot.</p><p>Yingying, this feather robe is for a woman. Take it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“This … How can I?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying wanted to reject him. After all, they were only following Lu Ming and they were all relying on him. They had also relied on Lu Ming to enter this Hall and kill those few people.</p><p>She didn’t even put in any effort, but the treasure was going to belong to her. How could she accept it?</p><p>it’s fine. We can’t use a woman’s things. Just accept it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying pondered for a moment before nodding her head. She bowed to the woman, then took off the feather clothes on the woman’s body and kept them in her storage ring.</p><p>Then, the three of them followed the original path and left the palace.</p><p>“An underground Palace has appeared in front of us!”</p><p>let’s go and take a look. There’s definitely a valuable treasure!</p><p>As soon as the three of them walked out of the palace, they heard this news. Streaks of rainbow light streaked across the void and flew towards the depths of the buildings.</p><p>“An underground Palace?”</p><p>The three of them looked at each other and saw the intention in each other’s eyes.</p><p>“Shall we go and take a look?”</p><p>Qiu Hao said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The three of them rose into the air and flew toward the depths of the building.</p><p>Below them, the vast buildings flashed past.</p><p>Soon, the three of them saw a dense crowd of thousands standing in the air before them.</p><p>One by one, they exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>More than half of them exuded the aura of martial emperors.</p><p>Most of the young men who had entered this time were originally at the limit of the Supreme-being realm, especially the local young men. Therefore, as soon as they entered, they underwent their tribulation and broke through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The rest had yet to break through because their cultivation had yet to reach the limit of the Supreme-being realm.</p><p>The group of people looked forward.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two stepped forward and looked ahead.</p><p>In front of them, on a plain, there was a place that had caved in. A layer of faint light was spreading out. It was a building in the corner.</p><p>From its shape, it should be a corner of a huge Palace. The other parts of the palace were still buried underground.</p><p>From the conversations of the people around them, Lu Ming and the rest learned that there was a huge battle here previously. The ground caved in and they discovered this Palace.</p><p>“Everyone, this Palace is buried deep underground. It must be extraordinary. How about we dig it out?”</p><p>Someone suggested.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
