I’m afraid there will be a large number of swordtail plates. Ying Ying, brother Qiu …</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu Yingying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>...</p><p>What he meant was obvious. It was too dangerous to continue forward. With Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao’s strength, they would be in danger if they entered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, big brother and I will wait for you outside!” He said.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying was very smart and quickly opened her mouth.</p><p>She knew that if she and Qiu Hao followed Lu Ming, they would only be a burden to him.</p><p>Lu Ming could only move freely when he was alone.</p><p>“Alright, then you guys wait for me outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said worriedly.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and soared into the sky. Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao returned the way they came and left the place.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was alone. His speed suddenly increased, like a Phantom, he flashed past the void.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>After Lu Ming had flown for a while, hundreds of swordtail plates launched attacks at him.</p><p>It was so sudden and so fast that an ordinary Martial Emperor would not be able to survive such an attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was no ordinary Martial Emperor.</p><p>The chaos realm covered his entire body. The sharp spikes of the sword tail disc could not break through Lu Ming’s chaos realm at all.</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain trembled, and the spikes were all shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch and the chaos Domain crushed forward. The swordtail discs exploded under the powerful fist force.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to move forward.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming encountered a few waves of attacks, but he simply dashed past them and blasted them into pieces.</p><p>Soon, a forest appeared in front of them.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze looked into the distance.</p><p>This forest occupied a very large area.</p><p>In the center of the forest, there was a tall tower in the shape of a sword. It was like a divine sword that pierced through the sky.</p><p>Even from far away, he could see it.</p><p>“Is that the land of inheritance?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Not far away, someone was charging forward.</p><p>This person was very strong and should be someone with an innate spirit body. However, at this moment, a large group of swordtail plates flew out from the forest below and attacked this person. This person tried his best to attack, but he couldn’t break through the defense of the swordtail plates. Several big holes were pierced in his body and he almost died here. He could only retreat in a sorry state.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the forest and discovered that there were many corpses.</p><p>This was because all of them had wanted to charge through the forest and had been killed by the swordtail disc.</p><p>Presumably, this forest was the lair of the sword’s tail plate, and no one knew how many sword’s tail plates were living in it.</p><p>If they wanted to enter the sword Pagoda, they had to pass through this forest.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, another group of swordtail plates flew out and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming pressed forward with one hand and the chaos Domain spread out, enveloping the swordtail plates. Then, with a shake, the swordtail plates were shaken to death and fell into the forest like raindrops.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He stepped forward and walked toward the sword Pagoda.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout was heard. Then, two beams of light flashed toward Lu Ming. The beams of light converged and two figures appeared.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>One of them was the young man who had been besieged by the sword’s tail plate and then directed it to Lu Ming and Qiu Yingying.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look for him but he appeared on his own.</p><p>The other person’s aura was also extremely strong. It was obvious that he was a heaven’s favorite of the same level as this person.</p><p>your domain is very mysterious. It can actually restrain the swordtail disc. No wonder you’re not dead. Now, take us there!</p><p>The young man who had dragged Lu Ming and the rest into the water previously said coldly.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with your brain?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>The young man’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>you framed me before and wanted to drag me down to help you escape. Now, you’re actually asking me to bring you over. Is there something wrong with your brain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“If you don’t take me there, you’ll die now!”</p><p>The young man said, his body exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then you … Just go to hell!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, he threw a punch.</p><p>Driven by Lu Ming’s fist force, the chaos Domain crushed toward the young man.</p><p>“You still dare to attack, you’re courting death … Ah, that’s not right …”</p><p>The young man started to shout but soon, he realized that Lu Ming’s fist force was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>He mustered all his strength and slashed with his saber. However, under Lu Ming’s fist force, the saber radiance was shattered and the fist force landed on his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Half of his body exploded.</p><p>Although his combat strength was not weaker than Yin Feng’s, Lu Ming did not use his chaos realm when he fought with Yin Feng previously. Now that he used his chaos realm, he could simply crush Yin Feng.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed half of the young man’s body.</p><p>“Spare me …”</p><p>The young man was not dead yet, and he was begging for mercy in fear.</p><p>“It’s too late to beg for mercy now!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and threw half of the young man’s body into the forest. Instantly, dense sword tail discs flew out of the forest.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The young man roared. In the next moment, he was drowned by the sword tail plate. His whole body was pierced into a hornet’s nest, and he died on the spot.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his body like a stream of light.</p><p>The other young man was almost scared to death when he saw Lu Ming’s combat strength. He fled in fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that he caught up to him in a few breaths. The result was already decided. With one move, the young man was half-dead. Lu Ming followed the same pattern and threw the heavily injured young man into the forest, where he was ‘pierced by ten thousand arrows’.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to walk forward.</p><p>The dense swordtail disc rushed out of the forest and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming covered his entire body with the chaos Domain and cast the wind element technique. His entire person seemed to have transformed into a long spear and he charged forward.</p><p>The swordtail disc exploded wherever Lu Ming passed by, opening a path in the dense cluster of swordtail discs.</p><p>The swordtail disc could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming successfully rushed through the forest and approached the sword Pagoda.</p><p>The strange thing was that as soon as they rushed through the forest, the swordtail plates stopped chasing and all retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not far from the sword Pagoda, a terrifying rumble was heard. Someone was fighting.</p><p>“Get lost! The Royal fruit is mine!”</p><p>“You think you can get the Royal fruit? in your dreams!”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Sword-light, saber-light, and palm-print surged. Four figures were in a chaotic battle in that area.</p><p>These four people’s combat strength was shocking. They were even stronger than Yin Feng.</p><p>No wonder he could break through the encirclement of the sword’s tail plate and rush here.</p><p>“The Royal fruit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and discovered three fruit trees. Each fruit tree had a fruit growing on it. Each fruit was crystal clear and resplendent. The aura of the great Dao lingered around them.</p><p>“It really is the Royal fruit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened instantly. There was a fiery glow that flashed past.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
