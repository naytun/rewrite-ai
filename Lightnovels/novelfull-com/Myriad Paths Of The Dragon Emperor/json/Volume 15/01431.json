As the saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated. In these two years, besides cultivating, we have not been idle. We have investigated some of the major forces in the Cang region and some outstanding geniuses!</p><p>the life-and-death Sword sect is a very special existence among the thirteen top sects. The other sects have many disciples, but the life-and-death Sword sect has very few. They are extremely strict when it comes to accepting disciples!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, the number of people from the life and death Sword sect who entered the great emperor secret realm this time was the least.</p><p>and this Luo Xiang is the most terrifying heaven’s favorite in the life and death Sword sect. It’s said that he started training with the sword at six, reached the spiritual ocean tier at seven, and reached the limit of the Supreme-being at nine!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“He trained in the sword at the age of six, and reached the limits of the Autarch level at the age of nine?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>This kind of cultivation speed was simply too fast. It was simply unimaginable.</p><p>Although this was the yuan continent, it was still too terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was already very shocking after he obtained the nine Dragons bloodline. However, he had spent more than ten years cultivating until now.</p><p>although Luo Xiang’s talent isn’t bad, he looks like he’s already in his 20s. It’s not that exaggerated!</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s the scariest thing about Luo Xiang. It’s said that he could’ve broken through to the Emperor realm long ago, but he’s been suppressing it at the limit of the Supreme realm. His purpose is to nurture his sword soul and temper his sword heart. He’s been suppressing it for 15 years!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a hint of shock.</p><p>In order to nurture his sword soul and temper his sword heart, he was actually willing to suppress himself to the same realm for fifteen years. This kind of person was too terrifying.</p><p>Now that Luo Xiang had made a breakthrough and obtained the inheritance of the sword doctrine, he would definitely rise up in the future and become an absolutely terrifying figure.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly remembered Luo Xiang’s name in his heart.</p><p>Not to mention other things, just that kind of heart was worthy of respect.</p><p>Lu Ming asked himself. He could not suppress himself for fifteen years in one realm.</p><p>However, everyone’s path was different. Lu Ming had his own path. Other people’s paths might not be suitable for him.</p><p>The few of them chatted for a while before leaving.</p><p>Following that, the entire Mystic realm became even more lively.</p><p>Everyone was searching for the remaining inheritance.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>……</p><p>In the secret realm, there was a sea of blood. A Dragon’s Roar could be heard from within. Suddenly, a figure shot up into the sky and stood above the sea of blood with a shocking aura.</p><p>He was the leader of the Dragon God Valley, he Yu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A Rainbow Bridge rose from the blood sea and disappeared into the void.</p><p>The fourth inheritance appeared.</p><p>In a sea of flowers, an extremely beautiful woman stood in the middle. Her entire body was shining with resplendent light, and the light from the sea of flowers converged to form a Rainbow Bridge that shot into the void.</p><p>The fifth legacy had appeared!</p><p>There was also a Rainbow Bridge that rushed out from the desert.</p><p>The sixth legacy!</p><p>In an ancient temple, a young man was bathed in holy light. He only disappeared after a long time.</p><p>After this person rushed out of the divine Hall, there was also a Rainbow Bridge that broke into the sky.</p><p>The seventh inheritance had appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One figure after another appeared beside the young man and bowed respectfully. congratulations, brother Shi! You’ve obtained the inheritance!</p><p>all seven inheritances have appeared. Emperor Cang’s chamber will soon appear. This time, Emperor Cang’s treasures will belong to my Tian Shen sect!</p><p>The young man spoke with a Supreme might, like a Divine Spirit speaking.</p><p>“Emperor Cang’s treasure will definitely belong to my Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>The other young men chimed in.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in the secret realm was looking at the void.</p><p>the seven inheritances have all appeared. Emperor Cang’s bedroom is about to appear!</p><p>On a mountain peak, Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying, and Qiu Hao stood facing the wind, looking at the sky.</p><p>During this period of time, they had been searching for inheritances, but unfortunately, their luck seemed to have run out. They had not found any inheritances.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, seven rainbow bridges rushed into the void from all directions and gathered together.</p><p>The entire secret realm of the great emperor could see it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shaking roar came from the place where the rainbow bridges converged. Then, the cry of an Eagle resounded through the world.</p><p>In the depths of the void, there seemed to be a behemoth that was about to break out of the void.</p><p>“Emperor Cang’s chamber is about to appear!”</p><p>“Charge! I want to seize the initiative!”</p><p>I didn’t get the seven inheritances. The inheritance of Emperor Cang is mine!</p><p>One figure after another flew into the sky from all directions, rushing toward the place where the rainbow bridges converged.</p><p>From below, the scene was extremely magnificent.</p><p>Countless silhouettes were densely packed as they gathered in one place. It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>“Let’s go up too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, they rose into the air and flew to the sky.</p><p>At this moment, another Eagle’s Cry resounded through the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The void shattered, and a giant creature slowly appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>It was a Goshawk, a huge Goshawk.</p><p>To be more precise, it was a building in the shape of an Eagle. From a distance, it looked lifelike, and a vast aura pressed down on everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Was this Emperor Cang’s bedroom?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Legend had it that Emperor Cang was a Goshawk that became the Emperor. He was the Supreme demon Emperor of his generation.</p><p>“There’s a lot fewer people!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, when they entered the great emperor secret realm, there were more than 300000 people. But now, there were less than 200000 people here.</p><p>The others had almost all fallen.</p><p>More than 100000 of them had died. What a shocking number.</p><p>The great emperor secret realm had great opportunities, but it also came with great dangers.</p><p>For example, at least ten thousand people had died to the swordtail disc in the land of sword principle inheritance.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A moment later, the entire Goshawk appeared in everyone’s sight.</p><p>It was huge, too huge. A Goshawk covered the sky and the sun. The entire Goshawk was black and shiny. He didn’t know what material it was made of.</p><p>“Where’s the entrance?”</p><p>Everyone was watching, but they couldn’t see an entrance.</p><p>The outside of the goshawk’s body was smooth, so it was impossible for it to be the real bedroom. The real bedroom must be inside the goshawk.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>At this moment, the cry of a Goshawk resounded through the world. Everyone saw that the goshawk’s mouth had opened, revealing a pitch-black passage.</p><p>Could this be the passageway to Emperor Cang’s bedroom?</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. In the end, some of them gritted their teeth and rushed toward the goshawk’s mouth.</p><p>If this was really a passageway, then entering first would allow them to gain the upper hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
