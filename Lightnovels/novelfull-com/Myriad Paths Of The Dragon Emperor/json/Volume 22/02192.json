A purple beam of light burst out and pierced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, purple light burst forth from his body. A giant axe appeared in his hand, and he slashed upward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming slashed down with all his might. The sword of death hit the purple beam that was shooting out of the evil god tribe member’s third eye.</p><p>The sword of death trembled. The death law and the five laws trembled continuously, forming a terrifying cutting force that directly cut the light beam apart and continued to cut.</p><p>Then, the sword of death collided with the giant axe.</p><p>A violent explosion rang out as the death Sword trembled. However, the opponent s giant axe trembled even more violently. In the end, it exploded and turned into fragments that flew everywhere. Many of the fragments struck the evil god tribe members ‘bodies.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The body of the evil god tribe member was sent flying, and wounds appeared on his body, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>But he didn’t die!</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The evil god tribe was only a four-star void Emperor.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could kill an ordinary four-star illusionary Emperor in seconds with the sword of death.</p><p>Even a five-star void Emperor could be seriously injured with one move.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming had launched a surprise attack and slashed down with his sword, he had not killed the other party. He had only severely injured the other party. The combat strength of the evil god tribe had exceeded Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>“It’s not any weaker than that blue pine stone!11</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>LAN Songshi was also a four-star illusionary Emperor. However, his combat strength was far stronger than the four-star illusionary emperors that Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>“This is the battlefield of the war between the two worlds. These people are all from the military camps of the two worlds. They’ve been fighting on the battlefield all year round, and their battle prowess is stronger than that of beings of the same level!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and came to this conclusion.</p><p>Of course, it only took an instant for Lu Ming to think of all these. He did not stop at ail and continued to kill the injured evil god tribe member.</p><p>However, at this moment, the other members of the evil god race had already reacted. Beams of terrifying purple light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to stop and block. He waved the sword of death to block the purple light beams.</p><p>He discovered that the power of these purple light beams was also very shocking.</p><p>The combat strength of every member of the evil god tribe was stronger than the black-scaled evil god tribe that Lu Ming had encountered in the past.</p><p>These were definitely the elites of the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming broke through a few purple light beams and charged towards a three-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>Even if he could not kill a four-star void Emperor in seconds, he should be able to kill a three-star void Emperor in seconds.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Among the eight evil god tribe members , there were a total of three four-star illusionary emperors. One of them had been severely injured by Lu Ming earlier, and there were two more.</p><p>At that moment, the two members of the evil god tribe were the main force and they launched a storm of attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other three-star illusionary Emperor evil god tribe members were attacking Lu Ming from the periphery.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He focused his attention to resist.</p><p>Although he could kill a three-star illusionary Emperor in seconds, it did not mean that he could ignore the attack of a three-star illusionary Emperor. Moreover, the attack power of these three-star illusionary emperors was very terrifying. Lu Ming would be injured if he was hit.</p><p>“Human ant, how dare you ambush me! Kill! ”</p><p>The evil god tribe member who had been ambushed by Lu Ming had also returned.</p><p>Lu Ming was surrounded by eight members of the evil god race. For the time being, he could only protect himself and could not kill the enemy at all.</p><p>T underestimated the enemy!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>Back in the primordial realm, he had been able to kill a four-star void Emperor in seconds. In addition, his strength had recently increased, so he had not taken a four-star void Emperor seriously before, unless it was a top-notch heaven’s favorite like LAN Yun.</p><p>That was why he made his move and charged out.</p><p>Now, he understood that he had underestimated others.</p><p>This was the two realm battlefield. Those who could fight here were all elites, and there was no lack of experts.</p><p>it seems like 1 can only borrow the power of the third bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Instantly, a surge of energy from his third bloodline gushed into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to borrow too much power. The third bloodline was too strange. If he borrowed too much, his mind would be affected.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming’s strength had increased greatly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The third bloodline contained a strong killing intent. Lu Ming hollered, and a cold killing intent burst forth. All the members of the evil god tribe could not help but shudder.</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such a good opportunity? he took a step forward and slashed his death Sword at the evil god tribe member who had been severely injured by him previously.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This time, the evil god tribe member could no longer resist and was directly split in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming swept his battle sword horizontally and killed a three-star illusionary Emperor from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>After killing two people in a row, Lu Ming charged towards another four-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>The four-star illusionary Emperor roared and used his trump card to block. However, after the combat sword slashed, all his attacks collapsed. His whole body flew out and fell heavily on the ground, unable to move.</p><p>Although he didn’t die, he didn’t have the strength to fight anymore.</p><p>As the number of opponents decreased, Lu Ming’s strength increased. Lu Ming was even more invincible.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>With another two sword strikes, another two three-star illusionary emperors were killed.</p><p>In just a few breaths, only three of the eight were left.</p><p>The remaining three people were finally scared and turned to run.</p><p>How could Lu Ming let the other party escape? his figure flickered and he chased after them. With one slash, he killed the remaining two three-star illusionary emperors. Only the last four-star illusionary Emperor was left, but he had already escaped some distance away.</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase at top speed. After five kilometers, Lu Ming caught up with the other party.</p><p>“We ll die together!”</p><p>Seeing that he couldn’t escape, the evil god tribe member roared as his third eye burst forth with a brilliant light that was like a small purple Sun.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A purple beam of light with terrifying power shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>After shooting out this beam of light, the aura of the evil god tribe’s members immediately weakened.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hair stood on end. This beam of light gave him a sense of danger.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and slashed down.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a huge tremor, the sword of death in Lu Ming’s hand actually exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quickly, feeling his palm go numb.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>The power of his opponent’s desperate attack was truly shocking. At this moment, he had borrowed the power of his third bloodline, but the sword of death was still scattered by his opponent.</p><p>Seeing that he had not managed to kill Lu Ming despite his all-out attack, the evil god tribe member revealed a look of despair.</p><p>human ants, my race will trample you all to the ground. We will exterminate all of you lowly ants, leaving no one alive!</p><p>The evil god tribe member roared.</p><p>“In the future, you will be the ones to be destroyed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. The sword of death was condensed once again. He swung the sword and killed the other party.</p><p>After putting away the other party’s storage bracelet, Lu Ming charged back and killed the heavily injured evil god tribe member.</p><p>Lu Ming would not show any mercy to the evil god tribe. He would kill as many as he could!</p><p>The evil god tribe was bent on breaking through the heaven realm and the primordial realm. When that time came, the people would be plunged into misery and suffering.</p><p>If you don’t kill them, they will kill you!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
