She’ll most likely reveal her true form in this battle!</p><p>The old Emperor smiled.</p><p>Bubbles ‘opponent was an extremely burly man. He was almost three meters tall and his muscles were like dragons. In front of him, bubbles looked like a tiny dot.</p><p>“Little fellow, reveal your true form. Otherwise, I really can’t do anything to such a small thing like you!”</p><p>The burly young man said in a low, muffled voice.</p><p>big guy, don’t think that you can defeat me just because you’re big. If you want me to reveal my true body, it’ll depend on your ability, chirp chirp!</p><p>Pao Pao pouted, her face filled with disdain.</p><p>“Little guy, let’s see how capable you are!”</p><p>The burly young man grinned. In the next moment, he charged towards the bubble like a mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He punched out, and the void trembled.</p><p>This was a child of primordial chaos who controlled primordial chaos laws.</p><p>“I’ll spray!”</p><p>Bubbles called out, opened his mouth, and exhaled. A transparent bubble enveloped the other party.</p><p>At the same time, with a flash of her body, she disappeared. However, ripples appeared in the void as the space shattered like a mirror, transforming into a terrifying sharp sword that slashed towards the burly youth.</p><p>space-time law!</p><p>The burly young man growled and kept punching out with his fists. The transparent bubbles burst and then he hit the space swords.</p><p>However, when he punched out, the speed of his fist became extremely slow, like the speed of a turtle.</p><p>Everyone knew that the burly young man was affected by the power of time. Time in the void had slowed down, so the speed of his fist had become extremely slow.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The burly youth roared as primordial chaos laws erupted.</p><p>Primordial chaos laws were very similar to chaos laws. They were as heavy as mountains, and each move contained infinite power.</p><p>The other party wanted to use absolute power to break the restraints of the bubble’s space-time law.</p><p>Sure enough, the other party burst out with all his strength, and the speed of his fist suddenly increased, blowing up all the space swords.</p><p>The fist energy did not stop as it continued to blast towards Pao Pao.</p><p>However, space-time laws were unpredictable. With a flash of her body, she disappeared and reappeared behind the burly youth, continuing her assault on him.</p><p>After breaking through to the martial Supreme realm, bubbles ‘use of spacetime laws had become even more profound. Her various unfathomable techniques were even more powerful than before.</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse was born with the ability to control space-time laws. The further it advanced, the more terrifying its control over space-time became.</p><p>Otherwise, the space-time spirit rat would not be known as one of the top ten war beasts.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly young man quickly turned around and attacked the back.</p><p>However, bubble’s figure disappeared again.</p><p>Just like that, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves, and the burly young man gradually lost his patience.</p><p>“Little guy, if you continue to waste time with me like this, neither of us will be able to do anything to the other!”</p><p>The burly young man roared.</p><p>“Who said that? chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out and suddenly appeared above the burly man. His hands kept dancing. With the burly young man as the center, the void trembled like water waves, turning into killing power that attacked the burly man.</p><p>Moreover, with the acceleration of the power of time, the power of space was shockingly fast. In an instant, it had reached the burly young man.</p><p>The burly young man was shocked. He set up layers of defense around his body to block the bubble’s attack. There was a series of explosions.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles opened her mouth and continuously spat bubbles.</p><p>More than a hundred transparent bubbles appeared and then disappeared. The next moment, they all covered the burly youth.</p><p>The big bubbles covered the small bubbles, enveloping the burly teenager in layers.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>The burly young man continued to bombard the bubbles, trying to break them.</p><p>When he had shattered all the transparent bubbles, bubbles stopped and smiled at him. “Big guy, you lose, chirp chirp!”</p><p>What?</p><p>The burly young man was stunned for a moment. Then, he looked around and his face turned bitter.</p><p>It turned out that he had unknowingly left the range of the stone platform.</p><p>If he left the stone platform, he would lose.</p><p>“Senior, didn’t you say that she would reveal her true form?”</p><p>Someone asked the senior from before.</p><p>“This … This little fellow is very smart. Under her opponent’s carelessness, she used the law of space and time to move her opponent out of the fighting stage.</p><p>1 originally thought that she could only win by revealing her true form!”</p><p>The old man explained awkwardly.</p><p>bubbles has become stronger. As expected, her presence by my side has restricted her instead. I can’t unleash the potential of the space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Bubbles won and the stone platform flew back. The burly youth’s stone platform turned into dust and dissipated. He could only back out helplessly. This time, he had come to the end of the ten lands battle.</p><p>Every battle that followed was extremely exciting. It could be said to be a battle between the strong.</p><p>There were even children of God who had the same laws fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming watched as Yu He fought against another son of Samsara. The two of them exchanged more than a thousand moves before Yu He won with great difficulty. However, he was also seriously injured. After winning, he quickly healed his injuries.</p><p>The death blade also fought with his opponent for a few hundred moves, but it was also difficult for him to win.</p><p>However, there were a few people who won easily.</p><p>For example, the unscrupulous monk had become even stronger. He had almost crushed a Son of Heaven who had become a martial Supreme.</p><p>Yuan Xin was the same. She was overbearing and ended the battle in less than ten moves.</p><p>However, what made Lu Ming’s face turn grave the most was the child of destiny.</p><p>This time, there was a gathering of heaven’s favorites. There were dozens of children of God, but there was only one who could control the law of fate.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yuan Xin were the only two who had mastered the Laws of Chaos. Among the children of heaven, they were the least in number.</p><p>Destiny’s Child was simply too powerful and unfathomable. It was difficult to measure his battle prowess.</p><p>That was because his fighting style was too unique and shocking.</p><p>He had fought with his opponent, and he had only said one sentence before his opponent had been defeated.</p><p>He said,” you are destined to lose. Then, the other party was inexplicably injured and sent flying off the stone platform.</p><p>This kind of battle method was simply inconceivable and shocked countless people.</p><p>“Controlling the law of fate, can control the fate of all living things in the world!”</p><p>An older great emperor said.</p><p>Countless people were horrified.</p><p>By controlling the laws of fate, one could truly control the fate of all living things in the world.</p><p>Didn’t that mean that whoever he said would die would die?</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn’t it be too terrifying? he would be like a god that ruled over everything.</p><p>However, another great emperor had said that if he wanted to use the mysteries of the laws of fate, he had to rely on his own strength.</p><p>For example, Destiny’s Son was currently at the illusionary Emperor realm. It was impossible for him to kill a true Emperor. The other party’s strength was completely capable of resisting the attack of the law of fate.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This made sense. Otherwise, the laws of fate would be too terrifying.</p><p>But even so, the law of fate was still extremely shocking. Many people believed that this time, the son of fate would win without a doubt..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
