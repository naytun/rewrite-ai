Instead, they would only drag themselves into this mess.</p><p>Not only that, fatty actually challenged Ren qianxing. This simply wouldn’t work, he was definitely not a match for Ren qianxing.</p><p>They knew Fatty’s cultivation. He had not become a saint yet.</p><p>Furthermore, even if fatty were to become a Sage, he wouldn’t be a match for Ren qianxing.</p><p>Ren qianxing had taken Di Shi Tian as his master and was able to cultivate a sacred art. In the divine wilderness, there was no such thing as sacred art.</p><p>If they were at the same cultivation level, they would definitely not be a match for Ren qianxing.</p><p>“Fatty, Xiao Shan, Xiao Rou, you guys should run!”</p><p>Hua Chi roared.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were Lu Ming’s disciples. If something happened to them because of him, how could he answer to Lu Ming?</p><p>“Let’s go. None of them will leave today!”</p><p>Ren qianxing’s voice was ice cold as killing intent flickered in his eyes. A powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The fatty actually dared to provoke him like this. He had to kill the fatty today and let everyone know that his dignity was not to be offended.</p><p>it’s fine. I’ll leave after I beat this guy up and let the world know that he’s a piece of trash!</p><p>Fatty grinned at Hua Chi.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had told him that he just had to make a move and that there was no need to worry about sakra and the other powerhouses.</p><p>Therefore, fatty was not afraid at all.</p><p>Hua Chi, Xia Jiuyang, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>He did not understand why fatty, Zhuang Xiaoshan, and Zhuang xiaorou were so confident today.</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>Even the spectators around them thought that fatty and the others had gone crazy. They were definitely going to die today.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Ren qianxing took a step forward, his killing intent growing even more intense, young master Ren, there’s no need for you to deal with these pieces of trash personally. Wouldn’t you be dirtying your hands? this younger brother can do it on your behalf!</p><p>At this moment, Li Ke stepped out and took the opportunity to suck up to Ren qianxing.</p><p>This act of flattery made Ren qianxing feel extremely comfortable. He nodded his head and replied, that’s good. A few clowns are indeed not worth my time. You can do it on my behalf. Cripple them first. I want them to regret it!</p><p>“Don’t worry, young master Ren!”</p><p>Li Ke nodded and bowed, then stepped toward the fatty and the others, bursting with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Li Ke, 1’11 fight you!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan stepped forward to meet Li Ke.</p><p>“Zhuang Xiaoshan, you piece of trash, you still dare to fight me? “Three months ago, you couldn’t even withstand one of my moves. You’re really courting death. Fine, I’ll let everyone know today that Lu Ming’s disciple is a piece of trash, and so is he. He’s just boasting!”</p><p>Li Ke sneered.</p><p>His words made many people’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>There were many people here who were from the Dragon Alliance back then. Many of them had witnessed Lu Ming’s heaven-defying rise and his dominance over an era.</p><p>But now, Li Ke said that Lu Ming was trash. Did that not mean that they were trash too?</p><p>“How dare you insult my master! 1’11 kill you today!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan was furious. His eyes were full of killing intent. A long spear appeared in his hand, and a powerful aura burst out.</p><p>The first stage of half-Saint!</p><p>“You … How did your cultivation level increase so quickly?”</p><p>Li Ke screamed in disbelief.</p><p>Three months ago, Zhuang Xiaoshan’s cultivation had only been at Lv 8 martial Royal realm. How could he have broken through several levels and entered the first stage of the half-Saint in just three months?</p><p>In the past three months, with the help of the monarch race, he had only broken through one level of cultivation and reached the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan’s improvement was even greater than his.</p><p>However, he quickly reacted. A ferocious look flashed in his eyes as he shouted, ” “You must’ve had some fortuitous encounter or obtained some powerful sacred medicine, but so what? You’ve relied on the powerful medicinal effects to raise your cultivation, but you’re still so weak. 1 can defeat you in one move!” So what if Zhuang Xiaoshan had reached the first stage of half-Saint?</p><p>He was now at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. His master was an Emperor-to-be from the sovereign race who had taught him the domain martial technique. He was confident that he could defeat Zhuang Xiaoshan with one move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura also burst out from Li Ke’s body.</p><p>At the same time, a combat sword appeared in his hand. The sword light burst out, carrying the power of law, and he attacked Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, any other first stage half-Saint who had not cultivated any domain techniques would not be able to take a single blow from him.</p><p>However, although Zhuang Xiaoshan had not had time to practice his domain martial technique, his spiritual body had reached the low-grade sky spiritual body.</p><p>A low-grade heaven spiritual body was considered a genius in the yuan continent.</p><p>Back then, the Azure region did not even have a single low-tier heaven spiritual body.</p><p>On the other hand, Li Ke’s spirit body was just an ordinary spirit body. Zhuang xiaorou’s spirit body’s power was enough to crush Li Ke.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou waved her spear and smashed it down.</p><p>There was no technique to speak of in this spear attack. It was just a simple spear strike. With the infusion of true essence, the long spear rapidly grew in size, like a giant pillar that held up the sky, and smashed down towards Li Ke. Bang! Bang!</p><p>Li Ke’s sword-light was shattered by the spear, and the huge spear smashed into Li Ke’s body.</p><p>Li Ke’s body was like a broken sandbag as he crashed heavily into the fighting ring below, causing it to rumble continuously.</p><p>Li Ke lay on the fighting ring, spitting out blood. His eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>He had actually been crushed by Zhuang Xiaoshan in one move.</p><p>Three months ago, this piece of trash who couldn’t even take a single move from him had actually crushed him with a single move.</p><p>He found it hard to accept!</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings was stunned.</p><p>Li Ke was known as one of the top ten elites of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In other words, other than the top ten heaven’s favorites, no one else was Li Ke’s match. But now, he was defeated by Zhuang Xiaoshan in one move.</p><p>Was this Lu Ming’s disciple?</p><p>If the disciple was like this, how could the master be bad?</p><p>“Brother Xiaoshan is so powerful!”</p><p>Hua Rou called out.</p><p>Hua Chi, Xia Jiuyang, and the others were also stunned.</p><p>They were very clear about Zhuang Xiaoshan’s cultivation and combat power. How did he become so strong after not seeing him for a while?</p><p>you’re cheating! You’re cheating! There are other experts helping you in secret!</p><p>Li Ke shouted crazily.</p><p>He remembered the last time!</p><p>Last time, someone had helped Zhuang Xiaoshan in secret. He was later defeated by Zhuang Xiaoshan, and he was also crushed by Zhuang Xiaoshan’s spear, just like this time.</p><p>“No one is secretly making a move!”</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace said indifferently, and his voice resounded throughout the entire place.</p><p>This time, the divine ox Palace had lost to the sovereign family. They had to give up the precious land of the East barren, which made him very unhappy. Now that he saw the sovereign family suffer a loss, he was naturally happy.</p><p>No one would doubt the words of the master of the divine ox Palace. He was a Martial Emperor realm expert, and an expert among martial emperors at that. “How is that possible?”</p><p>Li Ke found it hard to believe.</p><p>“You’re just a piece of trash, yet you still dare to criticize others!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan said sarcastically..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
