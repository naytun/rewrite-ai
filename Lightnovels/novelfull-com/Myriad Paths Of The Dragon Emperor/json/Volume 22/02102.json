Including him, there were exactly So people.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He did not pay attention for a moment, which allowed Muyang to escape.</p><p>“It’s over, hahaha, it’s over!”</p><p>Mu yang was ecstatic.</p><p>He finally made it to the end and became one of the last 80 people, so he could obtain an opportunity.</p><p>wait until 1 break through to the martial Supreme realm. I’m going to cut you into eight pieces!</p><p>Mu yang stared at Lu Ming and roared in his heart.</p><p>“You’re lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and sized up the remaining people.</p><p>Bubbles, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Qin Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, Luo Xiang, and Luo Tianyi had all successfully remained in the fighting ring.</p><p>Apart from Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli, the others had all entered the Emperor-to-be realm. Moreover, they were in groups of three. Unless they were targeted by the Son of Heaven, it would not be difficult for them to last until the end.</p><p>alright, the eighty of you have passed the selection. Now, 1’11 let you rest for a while. Then, follow me. A great opportunity is waiting for you!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor announced.</p><p>The 8o people on the stage were naturally overjoyed, while those who had been eliminated were sighingin despair, somewhat unwilling.</p><p>On the fighting ring, some of rhe injured people immediately sat down cross-legged and began to heal.</p><p>“Big brother, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the others walked over and cupped their fists to thank Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Of course, his voice had also changed.</p><p>Qiu Yue sized Lu Ming up curiously. She had a feeling that Lu Ming was very familiar. This was her intuition.</p><p>After that, Long Chen, Huang Ling, desolate li, and the rest came over to express their gratitude to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to acknowledge everyone but after thinking about it, he held back.</p><p>It wouldn’t be too late to acknowledge it later.</p><p>“Long Chen, long time no see!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk walked over with a smile. Wuchen and moonless were with him.</p><p>Wuchen’s cultivation was at the peak of Emperor-to-be, and he could control the laws. He was extremely powerful and was a top heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Moonless was a little worse. Although she also had the cultivation of Emperor-to-be, she only had the king body.</p><p>heartless, I haven’t seen you for many years. 1 didn’t expect that you’ve already become an Emperor!</p><p>Long Chen also greeted Wu Liang.</p><p>haha, let me tell you, I’m the reincarnation of the Buddha God. I’m destined to be a man who will fight at the peak. Back in the divine wilderness continent, I just didn’t discover my potential, so I wasn’t your match. Now, be it you or Lu Ming, neither of you are my match!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk laughed and was extremely proud.</p><p>“Hmph, if my master was here, you definitely wouldn’t be his match!”‘</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila was displeased to hear Lu Ming being belittled.</p><p>At the mention of Lu Ming, everyone fell silent. How was he now?</p><p>I’m a rice-haired guy. Don’t worry. Lu Ming is an old fox. He’s very smart and won’t die so easily. Other than me, who can barely suppress him, no one is his match!</p><p>The monk said.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyelids kept twitching. This guy, was he complimenting him or belittling him? why did he feel so uncomfortable listening to him?</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli glared at Wu Liang. If it wasn’t for the fact that they couldn’t beat Wu Liang, they would have beaten him up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, bubbles figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of Lu Ming. She blinked her big eyes and sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>After not seeing each other for a few years, bubbles still looked like she was two or three years old, as if she would not grow up. However, her cultivation base was improving at a rapid pace, and she was about to break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>“You are brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles suddenly said.</p><p>Of course, bubbles was transmitting her voice, so no one else heard her.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. He could not hide it from bubbles. The top ten beasts were no small matter.</p><p>bubble, it’s me. Don’t tell anyone for now!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“I knew you didn’t die!”</p><p>Bubbles transmitted a message, and her large eyes revealed a look of joy. She then ran to Xiangxiang Bella’s shoulder and sat down.</p><p>“Let’s adjust our breathing first!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi said. The battle just now had consumed a lot of energy.</p><p>Everyone sat cross-legged and began to adjust their breathing.</p><p>Not far away, Mu yang glanced at Lu Xiangxiang and the others from time to time with a ruthless expression on his face. He was thinking of some kind of evil plan.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes flashed with killing intent. He was afraid that if his identity was exposed, Muyang would do something to harm Lu Xiangxiang and the rest.</p><p>He seriously suspected that the last assassin from the death god nation was hired by Muyang.</p><p>A day quickly passed, and everyone was almost done recuperating.</p><p>“Come with me!”</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor ordered as he led everyone toward the center of the city.</p><p>The others followed suit. They were all curious about what this so-called opportunity was.</p><p>Soon, a majestic mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>This mountain peak was too majestic and too tall. It pierced through the sky.</p><p>This was the Mountain of Destiny, known as the most majestic mountain in the city of Destiny. Legend had it that it was connected to the sky and could lead to the heaven realm.</p><p>They landed on the destiny mountain.</p><p>He found that there were already many people on the destiny mountain.</p><p>“Has the battle in the southern Warzone ended?”</p><p>A beautiful woman looked over.</p><p>your Eastern Warzone is fast!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor smiled and greeted the other party.</p><p>Obviously, the other side was from the eastern battle region, and they had also selected 80 top heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The paragons on both sides sized each other up.</p><p>“The star River!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw the eternal Star River among the eighty people from the eastern war zone.</p><p>No wonder he had not been seen before. It turned out that he had gone to the eastern Warzone.</p><p>alright, you guys can rest here. When the time comes, the opportunity will naturally appear!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor said.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved as they all guessed what the so-called opportunity was. He could actually help people to become emperors, it made one s heart burn.</p><p>Everyone waited here. One day later, the heaven’s favorites from the North arrived.</p><p>Two days later, the heaven’s favorites from the Western battle region arrived.</p><p>Meanwhile, more and more people gathered near destiny mountain, filling the sky.</p><p>At the highest point, there were many figures standing there. They were shrouded in divine light and their faces couldn’t be seen clearly. However, each of them gave people a feeling of vastness and unfathomability.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. They knew that these people standing at the top and being enveloped by the divine light were all great emperors.</p><p>It wasn’t necessarily a great emperor from the divine fated land. There could be great emperors from other regions.</p><p>Time flew by quickly. In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><p>Suddenly, a ray of light bloomed in the depths of the Sky*</p><p>Then, the light became brighter and brighter.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>An immortal Emperor spoke.</p><p>Everyone’s spirit was roused as they all looked into the depths of the sky.</p><p>He’s here? What’s here?</p><p>Everyone was extremely curious.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky trembled. Then, everyone saw a path that extended all the way here.</p><p>This was an ancient road made of bluestone, filled with the marks of time.</p><p>A path had actually appeared in the sky, causing many people to be dumbfounded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
