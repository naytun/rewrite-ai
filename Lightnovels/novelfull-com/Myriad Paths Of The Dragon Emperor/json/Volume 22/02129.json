I control my own fate. No one can control my fate. If anyone can, I’ll crush them all!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely overbearing.</p><p>He didn’t believe in the so-called fate, that his destiny was in his own hands, not the heavens!</p><p>Only when one was strong enough could one change or even reverse fate.</p><p>the people before didn’t believe it either. They thought that they could go against fate, but in the end, they couldn’t escape fate!</p><p>Tianming didn’t get angry and said indifferently, as if he was in control of everything.</p><p>Oh, then have you seen your fate? the fate of being beaten up by me until you become a pig’s head? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>my fate has already been decided. I won’t lose!</p><p>The heavenly mandate’s whisper.</p><p>“Then I’ll change my fate and let you lose once!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Four types of laws burst out from Lu Ming’s body. The four types of laws fused. Lu Ming’s body was like a cannonball, smashing toward Tianming.</p><p>“You are destined to be injured!”</p><p>Tianming said softly and pointed with his finger.</p><p>There was no energy fluctuation, but at this moment, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end and his pupils constricted. He felt a terrifying force bombarding him and crushing him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming shook the law and the four types of laws converged to form a four-colored river of laws. It surrounded his body and blocked the strange energy attack.</p><p>“Is this the law of fate? It’s just a type of law. Although it’s mysterious and strange, it can’t really decide a person’s fate. It still needs energy to attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming had some understanding of the law of fate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out and broke through the energy attacks in one fell swoop. He then charged toward Tian Ming.</p><p>Tianming, don’t mess with these useless things. Use your divine ability!</p><p>Lu Ming said. His figure was like lightning as he rapidly approached the heavenly mandate realm.</p><p>“As you wish, great fate spell!”</p><p>The light on Tianming’s body became even more intense. His figure was almost invisible as he was covered by the light.</p><p>He pointed his finger and a ray of fate light turned into a combat sword, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming also pointed a finger and cast the chaos finger of tribulation. An extremely condensed finger force burst forth and destroyed the light of fate.</p><p>However, the destiny finger pointed out continuously. Beams of light of fate turned into various weapons and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>These weapons were extremely powerful and had terrifying killing power.</p><p>Tian Ming’s cultivation base was also at the peak of two-star illusionary Emperor, but his battle strength was absolutely amazing. Each ray of fate light could kill an ordinary two-star illusionary Emperor in seconds, and even an ordinary three-star illusionary Emperor in seconds.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the law and covered his palm. He used the chaos Divine palm and struck out continuously.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The rays of fate light were destroyed by Lu Ming and dissipated like fireworks.</p><p>Lu Ming was valiant and invincible. He continuously destroyed the light of fate that was attacking him. His figure was approaching Tianming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming broke through the barrier and pointed his finger. A chaotic finger of tribulation shot toward Tianming.</p><p>Tianming’s pupils constricted. A River of fate formed under his feet, and he was in the middle of it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current attack power was stronger than Yuan Xin’s. The finger of tribulation of chaos crushed over, shaking the river of fate.</p><p>everything is shrouded by the river of fate. Lu Ming, you shall be defeated!</p><p>Tianming let out a long cry and grabbed out a figure from the river of fate.</p><p>That figure looked exactly like Lu Ming, but it looked illusory. It was struggling in the hands of destiny as if Lu Ming’s fate was really in the control of destiny.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He pointed out the finger of destiny, and a ray of light pierced through the body of the shadow.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying force appeared out of thin air and blasted toward Lu Ming, trying to penetrate his body.</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. The four types of power of law shook continuously to block that force.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The four types of nomological laws were constantly shaking and breaking down bit by bit. The power was too ancient and terrifying. No one knew where it came from. Even the fusion of four types of nomological laws was difficult to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming retreated frantically and the four types of laws were pierced through. However, after the force pierced through the four types of laws, he was almost offset. It only left a shallow mark on Lu Ming’s body and he was not injured.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to lose!”</p><p>however, it’s enough to show how terrifying Lu Ming is. Yuan Xin was no match for this move and was seriously injured!</p><p>“However, Tianming’s move is too terrifying!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was forced to retreat, everyone guessed that the final winner of this battle would be Tianming.</p><p>Some of the forces that had a grudge against Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Lu Ming was not that heaven-defying.</p><p>“Fate can not be defied!”</p><p>The heavenly mandate spoke. He stood in the river of fate as if he was about to turn into a deity.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>He pointed out two fingers in a row and pierced through the shadow in his hand.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming suffered a terrifying attack. The laws trembled and Lu Ming retreated rapidly. However, he was blocked in the end and was not injured.</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged toward Tianming.</p><p>Tianming continued to attack with his fingers, and the force of his fingers pierced through the shadow. Lu Ming encountered a terrible attack. There were several terrible forces attacking him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was sent flying a few hundred meters. His body trembled and he felt his qi and blood churning.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I admit that you’re a rare genius. However, it’s difficult for you to defy the heavens. You can’t resist fate!”</p><p>Tianming coldly spoke, his voice high and mighty.</p><p>“You’re so confident, is this all you’ve got?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What?” Tianming frowned.</p><p>“How can you defeat me with this little bit of strength? You can’t hurt me now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Many people were shocked. It was true. Tianming could only force Lu Ming back but not severely injure him.</p><p>Lu Ming could use his strong defense to stall for time and make it difficult to determine the winner of this match.</p><p>Tian Ming’s face darkened. His body glowed with multicolored light and he struck out with his fingers continuously. However, he could only repel Lu Ming but not hurt him.</p><p>“Is this your limit? Then today, let me break fate!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His body was like lightning as he rushed toward Tianming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the process of charging out, the aura on his body became stronger, and the four-colored river of laws turned into five colors.</p><p>With this, the entire scene was ignited.</p><p>Oh my God, five colors, five laws. Lu Ming has mastered five laws. Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“It’s true. It’s too terrifying. There’s no limit. How is this possible?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had displayed four types of laws, which was already shocking enough. Everyone guessed that that was most likely Lu Ming’s limit.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had displayed five types of laws.. What was his limit?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
