How could they dare to stay? in fear, they turned around and ran away.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Another arrow flew over and was aimed at the five-star void Emperor.</p><p>The five-star illusionary Emperor let out a blood-curdling screech before he was shot dead.</p><p>On the other side, the old man continued his victorious pursuit and killed the five-star void emperor he had severely injured.</p><p>There were a total of six people on the other side, one six-star void Emperor and two five-star void emperors. All of them were killed, leaving only three four-star void emperors who were running for their lives.</p><p>The three members of the evil god race had fled in different directions. They knew that if they were to gather together, none of them would be able to escape.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The chubby young man roared and chased after a four-star illusionary Emperor from the evil god tribe.</p><p>The old man and the middle-aged man also chased after one each.</p><p>The evil god tribe member that the chubby young man was chasing happened to run toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, holding a large bow and pointing it at the evil god.</p><p>The evil god race member turned pale with fright and was almost scared to death.</p><p>Just now, it was two arrows that had killed a six-star and a five-star illusionary Emperor. Now that he saw Lu Ming appear with a large bow in his hand, it would be strange if he was not scared to death.</p><p>He was panicking, but the chubby youth had already arrived.</p><p>This kind of purple-scaled evil god race was extremely powerful. However, the chubby youth was a top-tier genius. Although his cultivation was one level lower, his combat strength was not any weaker. In fact, he was even stronger.</p><p>A blade light that was white and bright slashed toward the evil god race.</p><p>The evil god tribe was on guard against Lu Ming. In their panic, they were hit by the chubby young man and were severely injured.</p><p>The chubby youth’s attack had hit its target, and the subsequent attacks were endless. The snow-white blade light slashed out one after another toward the evil god tribe.</p><p>The evil god tribe had been severely injured and was already powerless to turn the situation around. They could only defend and no longer have the power to fight back. Defeat was a matter of time.</p><p>Lu Ming did not draw the bow. He was just scaring the other party.</p><p>Seeing that the matter was settled, he put away his bow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure flashed, and the old man appeared. He had obviously finished off his opponent.</p><p>After a while, the middle-aged man also appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the chubby young man had the upper hand. His blade light flashed and left many wounds on the evil god tribe members ‘bodies.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the end, the chubby young man shouted and cut off his head.</p><p>After killing the evil god tribe members, the chubby young man, elder, and middle-aged burly man turned to look at Lu Ming with shock in their eyes.</p><p>A moment ago, the arrow had instantly killed a six-star and a five-star void Emperor. They had not expected that the owner of the arrow would be so young.</p><p>“This brother, thank you for saving me just now!”</p><p>The chubby guy walked over and cupped his fists in thanks, his attitude sincere.</p><p>you’re too polite. How can I not kill an alien? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“How can 1 not kill you? that’s very reasonable. I’m Liu Hao. How should I address you, brother?”</p><p>The chubby young man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s brother Lu!”</p><p>Liu Hao gave a fist salute.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, little brother Lu!”</p><p>The old man and the burly man also thanked Lu Ming. Lu Ming said a few words of thanks.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you seem unfamiliar. Did you enter this battlefield alone?”</p><p>Liu Hao asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>it’s a little unsafe to come in alone. Right now, the evil god race has also sent a large number of experts into this ancient battlefield. Right now, the people from the heaven realm are gathering not far away. We’re gathering our strength to fight against the evil god race together. Brother Lu, why don’t you come with us?”</p><p>Liu Hao invited.</p><p>Lu Ming was in deep thought.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 go with you!” Lu Ming nodded after a while.</p><p>Lu Ming had his own considerations for agreeing to it.</p><p>First of all, Liu Hao’s group didn’t look like LAN Yun’s group, which was sinister, cunning, despicable, and shameless. Liu Hao’s group looked sincere and didn’t look like cunning people.</p><p>In addition, he couldn’t find the way out by himself. Only with the people of heaven realm could he find the way out and enter the Tai Qing heavenly realm.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, Liu Hao was overjoyed. He gave the six evil god tribe’s storage bracelets to Lu Ming, saying that it was all thanks to Lu Ming’s help this time. Otherwise, they would have all been done for.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and kept all of them.</p><p>Then, they headed in one direction.</p><p>They didn’t encounter any danger along the way. After a few hours, they came to a Bare Mountain range. Inside, there was a Valley. It was quite hidden, and the creatures from the heaven realm gathered here.</p><p>Other than the human clan, there were also divine beasts.</p><p>“There’s quite a lot of people!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they swept their gazes and discovered that there were more than a hundred people.</p><p>However, there were not many young people, only five or six of them. The rest were either middle-aged or old. There were both men and women. Without a doubt, they were all in the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Some of them had extremely profound auras, and the divine light of the world was faintly emanating from them.</p><p>True Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>This ancient battlefield was extremely dangerous. The stronger one’s cultivation was, the more dangerous it would be to enter.</p><p>There was already a certain level of danger when a true Emperor entered. They might be targeted by the marks of the experts.</p><p>Low-rank true emperors were still fine, but high-rank true emperors would definitely die when they encountered those marks.</p><p>Liu Hao greeted the few young men and introduced them to Lu Ming.</p><p>The few young men smiled and nodded at Lu Ming.</p><p>They did not have much reaction when they heard Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>It was obvious that even if they had heard of a peerless cripple in the primordial realm, they would not know Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled and nodded. He then stood by the side with Lu Ming.</p><p>Liu Hao whispered. This time, they had entered this ancient battlefield to try their luck and see if they could get some opportunities or treasures.</p><p>In addition, they had one more thing to do. They had to find out why the ancient battlefield had changed and what exactly had happened. Was it related to the evil god race?</p><p>The higher-ups of the heaven realm took this matter very seriously.</p><p>Therefore, they had gathered together. First, they wanted to exchange information. Second, they would have a higher chance of success if they worked together.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people arrived.</p><p>Not long after, about 150 people gathered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, more beams of light flew over.</p><p>This time, more than ten people came at once.</p><p>“LAN Yun!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. This time, there were more than ten people and the person in the lead was actually LAN Yun.</p><p>Now it seemed that his injuries had already healed.</p><p>LAN Yun and the rest landed in the valley and scanned the entire place. When he saw Lu Ming, his eyes were filled with killing intent as he strode toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, we meet again. This time, let’s see how you die.”</p><p>LAN Yun walked in front of Lu Ming and spoke coldly, his face revealing a ferocious expression.</p><p>The person who had come with LAN Yun also stepped forward, emitting a cold</p><p>aura..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
