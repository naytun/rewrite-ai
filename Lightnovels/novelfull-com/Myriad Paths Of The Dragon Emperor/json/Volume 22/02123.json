He was up against the ancient devil in the first round.</p><p>Just as everyone had expected, the ancient devil was very powerful but it was no match for Lu Ming and was defeated by him.</p><p>This was the second time that the ancient devil had lost to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had achieved three consecutive wins.</p><p>I guess Lu Ming’s winning streak ends here. None of the opponents he’s going to face next are weak. They’re all stronger than him!</p><p>that’s right. Three consecutive wins. 1 reckon he’ll lose six in a row!</p><p>Some people discussed and felt that Lu Ming’s winning streak would end here.</p><p>In the second match of the third round, bubble fought Chela.</p><p>This was a battle of the peak, a fierce battle.</p><p>Although bubble’s cultivation base was slightly weaker, her strength had increased tremendously after transforming into her true form. Her control over the space-time laws had also reached an unimaginable level.</p><p>Although creak was strong, it could not hit the bubble.</p><p>Of course, it would not be easy for bubble to defeat Chek. It could be said to be very difficult.</p><p>In the end, after more than 200 moves, Pinker was accidentally teleported out of the battle stage by a space-time Tunnel opened by bubbles.</p><p>In this battle, paoba had won.</p><p>This made everyone re-evaluate bubble’s strength and re-recognize the power of the top ten beasts.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, even the Son of Heaven was inferior to the top ten war beasts.</p><p>Next, it was Yuan Xin’s battle against the star River.</p><p>Needless to say, the Galaxy had suffered another crushing defeat.</p><p>This made his expression turn uglier and uglier.</p><p>There were already people who were certain that the Galaxy would definitely be ranked tenth. There was no suspense.</p><p>The fourth match, immoral versus virtuous.</p><p>This was yet another battle of the pinnacle.</p><p>Unscrupulously, he displayed the Golden body of Buddhism and various Buddhist divine powers, but his violent virtue broke all Dharma with one force.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves. The unscrupulous monk shouted, but it was useless this time. He was no match for Bao de and was finally defeated and thrown out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Bao de won this round.</p><p>The last match of the third round was Tianming versus Yun Haoge.</p><p>“I can see my own fate in the long river of time!”</p><p>Yun Haoge let out a long howl and used the laws of time and space to fight against destiny.</p><p>The laws of space and time could indeed somewhat counter the laws of fate.</p><p>Because he could see his own fate through the long river of time.</p><p>Of course, fate was changing at every moment. What he had seen was only a small part.</p><p>After that, Tianming used the great fate technique to cut off Yun Haoge’s long river of time and defeated him.</p><p>At the end of the third round, it was still Lu Ming, Tian Ming, and Yuan Xin who won three consecutive rounds.</p><p>However, everyone thought that Lu Ming was just lucky in the first three rounds. He was going to lose in the later rounds.</p><p>Tianming and Yuan Xin, on the other hand, were both earned through fighting.</p><p>After a few rounds, the white-haired elder let everyone rest for half a day. After half a day, the fourth round began.</p><p>The first match of the fourth round was still Lu Ming’s first match. However, his opponent this time was Yun Haoge.</p><p>Yun Haoge looked excited, and the two of them stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming, your luck is running out. You’ll be defeated in this battle. I’ll let you understand that you can’t have the space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>Yun Haoge said coldly.</p><p>your space-time law is too weak. You’re not my match. Admit defeat so that I don’t have to fight!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He told Yun Haoge to admit defeat.</p><p>This stunned everyone. They felt that Lu Ming had exaggerated too much.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had mastered two ultimate maxims and could be said to be unprecedented, he only had the cultivation base of an Emperor-to-be after all. How could he be Yun Haoge’s match?</p><p>Yun Haoge’s cultivation had already reached the level of a two-star illusionary Emperor. Furthermore, even if they were at the same level, he was still one of the best among the children of heaven. With such a huge difference in cultivation, how could Lu Ming be his match?</p><p>“Hehe, you want me to admit defeat? What a joke, I’m going to torture you!”</p><p>Yun Haoge said darkly. As soon as he finished speaking, he charged towards Lu Ming, shuttling through the void at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the process of Yun Haoge’s charge, the void in all directions began to distort. A terrifying force pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This energy contained the power of time and contained the ability to slow time. It made Lu Ming’s speed as slow as a turtle’s.</p><p>There was also the power of space. The space in all directions kept squeezing Lu Ming, trying to bind him.</p><p>On the contrary, Yun Haoge’s speed increased sharply with the help of the space-time law. He closed in on Lu Ming in the blink of an eye. With a point of his finger, the power of space condensed, containing a terrifying tearing force, and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>In the face of such a scene, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He struggled with all his might, and his physical body and Saint power burst out. The void trembled, and the space power on his body kept exploding.</p><p>Then, a long river of two-colored laws appeared.</p><p>This was the fusion of the Laws of Chaos and the laws of death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s arms trembled as he swung his palm. The void exploded, and the power of spacetime that was acting on his body was cut apart. Lu Ming’s palm flew toward Yun Haoge.</p><p>However, Yun Haoge’s body disappeared in a flash and reappeared behind Lu Ming, launching a blow at him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had eyes on the back of his head. He struck his palm backward, clashing with Yun Haoge’S. Yun Haoge’s figure drifted backward. Then, his body trembled, and a dense crowd of figures appeared from all directions. So many figures charged at Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>This was a terrifying killing move. Don’t think that the densely packed figures were all illusions. In fact, these figures were all real. They were all Yun Haoge’s real body.</p><p>He was shuttling through the void and walking in different spaces. This move was a move he used in different spaces.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Facing this move, Lu Ming used the chaos finger of tribulation. He extended both his hands and pointed out repeatedly.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Finger forces burst forth, and each finger force pointed at a figure.</p><p>Those figures exploded one by one and finally turned into one figure.</p><p>After that, Yun Haoge and Lu Ming exchanged dozens of moves, displaying the various profoundness of the space-time law to the fullest.</p><p>However, his control over time and space was not as good as bubbles’. Lu Ming protected himself with two types of nomological laws and remained unmoving, breaking all of Yun Haoge’s attacks.</p><p>Yun Haoge finally lost his patience.</p><p>“I’ll suppress you with my cultivation!”</p><p>Yun Haoge’s eyes were cold. His two-star illusionary divine cultivation was completely unleashed as he charged toward Lu Ming. Wherever he passed, space-time storms were created, engulfing Lu Ming.</p><p>“A head-on confrontation? That’s just what I want!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stood there without moving. When Yun Haoge was about to arrive, a long river of laws appeared on Lu Ming’s body again.</p><p>It was the river of array Dao laws!</p><p>The river of array Dao laws fused with the Laws of Chaos and death, causing the river of laws that surrounded Lu Ming to turn into three colors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased greatly after he had integrated another King path law.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He struck out with his palm, and the force of his palm was like an avalanche as it headed straight for Yun Haoge.</p><p>The spacetime storm around Yun Haoge’s body collapsed instantly. He screamed and retreated, spitting out blood..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
