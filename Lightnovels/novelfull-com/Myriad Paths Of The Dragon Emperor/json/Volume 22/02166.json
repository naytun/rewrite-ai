It was glowing with a crystal-like light, like a Divine Tree.</p><p>On the branches of the tree, there were nine fruits. They were as red as fire Jade, and the smell of medicine assailed the nose.</p><p>This was the Holy Spirit fruit. However, it had not ripened yet.</p><p>Around the mountain peak, figures could be seen flashing from time to time. They were all treasure-hunting groups.</p><p>However, the Holy Spirit fruit had yet to ripen. An unripe Holy Spirit fruit was completely useless. Hence, everyone was waiting for the Holy Spirit fruit to ripen.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also flew forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>“All!”</p><p>In the forest ahead, a fierce battle broke out. It was two treasure hunting groups fighting each other, and people were killed from time to time.</p><p>Not long after, one of the treasure-hunting groups was killed. Their storage rings were taken away, and their corpses would be left here forever.</p><p>The victorious treasure-hunting team also discovered Lu Ming and the rest. They swept a cold glance at them and then left in a flash.</p><p>As they neared Wuyuan mountain, more and more treasure-hunting groups appeared. Lu Ming spread out his spiritual sense and discovered at least a hundred treasure-hunting groups with more than a thousand people.</p><p>These people sized each other up with cold gazes, but they didn’t make a move.</p><p>It was obvious that they were all waiting for the moment when the Holy Spirit fruit ripened.</p><p>Once the Holy Spirit fruit ripened, there would most likely be a brutal battle.</p><p>However, for the sake of the Holy Spirit fruit, everything was worth it.</p><p>A Holy Spirit fruit could create a Saint realm expert.</p><p>Nine Holy Spirit fruits were equivalent to nine Sage state experts.</p><p>Although the world had changed greatly and everyone’s cultivation had skyrocketed, the Saint realm was still very rare. Every Saint realm expert was a top expert.</p><p>Of course, this did not include the experts from the yuan continent. They were only from the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The experts from the yuan continent were too strong. There was no way to compare.</p><p>Suddenly, a group of people walked toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There were more than ten of them, and each of them was an expert.</p><p>This was a very powerful treasure-hunting group.</p><p>how dare a weak treasure-hunting group like you try to snatch the Holy Spirit fruit? you really don’t know what’s good for you. Hand over your storage rings and scram!</p><p>A brawny man in his thirties berated.</p><p>The faces of Han Zhong and the others turned pale.</p><p>This treasure-hunting group was too powerful. It was obviously much stronger than the one that had attacked them before.</p><p>In the face of such a treasure-hunting group, they had no choice but to agree to their request.</p><p>They could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>They hoped that Lu Ming could create a miracle because they were not willing to hand over their storage rings.</p><p>The gains in the storage ring were all exchanged with their lives.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Why aren’t you handing over your storage rings? do you want to die?”</p><p>The burly man’s voice turned cold.</p><p>The other members of the treasure-hunting team sneered as they watched.</p><p>The treasure-hunting team was a profession that had only appeared in recent years. They traveled through all kinds of dangerous famous mountains and rivers and were used to seeing life and death battles.</p><p>Without strength, there was only death.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice sounded.</p><p>It was from Lu Ming!</p><p>The burly man was stunned. He looked at Lu Ming and thought that he had heard wrongly. This kid actually told him to get lost? Was he crazy?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura erupted from his body.</p><p>Seventh level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The brawny man had a cultivation of the seventh level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made the other members of the treasure-hunting group change their expressions. Many of them had grave expressions.</p><p>A Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert was considered a top expert among all the treasure-hunting groups.</p><p>The pressure of a seventh level Martial Emperor kept pressing down on Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were calm and relaxed!</p><p>As for Han Zhong and the other three, their expressions changed drastically and their bodies trembled as if they were being crushed by a huge mountain.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The burly man roared and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>I’m dead,” Lu Ming said faintly. A ray of death flashed in his eyes. Then, a ray of death light suddenly appeared on the burly man’s body and enveloped him.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>The brawny man let out a hoarse roar, and then, under everyone’s shocked gaze, he turned into ashes and disappeared.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps were heard. A Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert had been killed and turned into ashes. More importantly, no one could see how Lu Ming had attacked.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Han Zhong and the other three swallowed their saliva in shock. It seemed that Lu Ming’s abilities far exceeded their imagination.</p><p>“Do you all want to die too?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the remaining members of the treasure-hunting team.</p><p>Those people’s expressions changed and they retreated in a frenzy, disappearing in the blink of an eye. They didn’t dare to attack.</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of respect.</p><p>This was the outcome that Lu Ming wanted. In this way, others would not dare to have any ideas about them. It would save them a lot of trouble.</p><p>“Who is this young man? I’ve never seen him before. Could it be an expert from the yuan continent?”</p><p>that’s impossible. Every one of them from the yuan continent is extremely terrifying. Ordinary Saint realm experts are like ants in front of them. There are no weaklings!</p><p>that’s right, but this young man looks so young, yet he has such strength. Could he be one of the top ten elites of the divine wilderness continent? ”</p><p>no, I’ve seen all of the top ten heaven’s favorites. I don’t think there’s such a person!</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>“The top ten heaven’s favorites?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of interest.</p><p>Everyone continued to wait.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening bull’s roar came from the distant horizon.</p><p>Then, everyone saw five or six giant Bulls the size of mountains running toward them. The void rumbled as they stepped on it.</p><p>They were only five or six Bulls, but they were like an Army of thousands.</p><p>The speed of the five or six giant Bulls was unbelievably fast. In the blink of an eye, they arrived in the sky above Wuyuan mountain. Then, the giant Bulls ‘bodies rapidly transformed into six burly men. Their terrifying auras burst out, causing everyone’s expression to change.</p><p>“It’s the experts from the divine ox Palace!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in fear.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this time, the roars of beasts came from the other side. Everyone saw a few giant wolves pulling a chariot. They arrived in the sky above Wuyuan mountain in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the chariot, there were seven brawny men dressed in animal skins.</p><p>it’s the people from manlong Palace!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Emperor-to-be, absolute Saint in the great circle!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed.</p><p>He could tell the cultivation of these people with a single glance.</p><p>Half of them were Emperor-to-be experts, and the rest were complete absolute Saints.</p><p>This was definitely not a native of the divine wilderness continent. The divine wilderness continent had only been revived for less than ten years, so it was impossible for such a powerful existence to be born.</p><p>Most of these people came from the yuan continent.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, these people were not from the Azure continent, the Emperor continent, or the cloud continent.</p><p>could it be that other than the Azure continent, the cloud continent, and the Emperor continent, there are other places that have teleportation arrays that lead to the continent cluster of the divine Ruins? ”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
