There were too many experts.</p><p>They attacked together and all kinds of attacks fell on the Wind Clan’s Mountain Gate. Instantly, a large number of people from the Wind Clan, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect were killed.</p><p>“I’ll exterminate you all!”</p><p>The wind race’s leader’s eyes were bloodshot. He first stared at the palace Master of the Phoenix Palace. Then, his body soared into the sky, bringing with it an endless Gale as he charged toward the palace Master.</p><p>The Feng clan’s clan leader was a seven-star true Emperor, a peak true Emperor. In ancient Moon sanctuary, he was almost invincible.</p><p>None of the leaders of the other forces had such a cultivation.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord shouted. The cry of a Phoenix resounded from her body and resounded through the firmament. A huge Phoenix pounced toward the wind race’s leader.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>Then, the sound of an elephant trumpeting was heard. Long Chen’s master had made his move.</p><p>Long Chen’s master was a Grand Elder of the divine elephant sect. He was a six-star true Emperor and was on the same level as the palace Master of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>He also made his move. With a punch, a giant elephant that could support the heavens and the earth stepped on the void and rushed toward the Wind Clan leader.</p><p>At the same time, thunder and lightning filled the air as if a Heavenly Tribulation had descended. A figure shrouded in lightning appeared. He used a great Divine Art and charged toward the Wind Clan leader.</p><p>This was the Thunder God sect’s sect master, who was also a six-star true Emperor!</p><p>In addition, the leader of another force also made a move.</p><p>The four great experts fought the Wind Clan’s patriarch together. The two sides engaged in an intense battle, and it was difficult to determine the victor.</p><p>The other places were in a state of intense fighting.</p><p>The WAN family’s head and the purple Extreme sect’s sect head both had their respective powerhouses to fight with them.</p><p>The wind race was caught in the flames of war.</p><p>Furthermore, the wind race, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect were completely at a disadvantage. People were constantly being killed.</p><p>Although the wind race was strong, it was the number one in Gu Yue Holy Land.</p><p>However, this time, the top ten forces had joined forces and sent out all their experts. They had completely surpassed them.</p><p>Experts from the wind race, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect died in battle one after another, their blood spraying into the sky.</p><p>In the sky, the battle between Lu Ming and the goateed Emperor had entered its final stage.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with all his strength. More than thirty percent of his energy had completely surpassed that of a two star great emperor.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not need to defend. He could only attack. His combat strength had undoubtedly become stronger.</p><p>The goateed Emperor spat out a mouthful of blood as half of his body exploded from Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>His hair was disheveled, his body was bathed in blood, and his aura was becoming more and more dispirited.</p><p>He tried his best to escape, but Lu Ming would not let him escape.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about defense. He attacked with all his might. His attacks were like a storm. In an instant, he had slashed hundreds of times, completely cutting off the other party’s retreat.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>The goateed Emperor howled madly.</p><p>Could it be that he was going to die Here today?</p><p>He was indignant. He had come here to kill Lu Ming, not to throw his life away.</p><p>He was a great emperor. As long as he survived the Tribulation, his lifespan would be endless. He would dominate a region and be respected and revered by countless people.</p><p>He didn’t want to die!</p><p>He resisted with all his might.</p><p>But it was useless.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Golden Saber in his hand had been shattered after a series of battles, and its fragments flew everywhere.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to pursue and cut off the goatee’s other arm with one slash.</p><p>The goateed Emperor roared as he tried to recover from his injuries.</p><p>At the great emperor realm, as long as one’s soul wasn’t destroyed, even a drop of blood could heal one’s body.</p><p>However, he couldn’t do it this time. His body couldn’t recover immediately.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s stone sword contained a terrifying destructive power that was constantly destroying his physical body.</p><p>The goateed Emperor’s battle-power was even weaker now that his monarch weapon was destroyed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was still as violent as ever as he slashed his sword at the goateed Emperor’s forehead.</p><p>The glabella was the place where souls were stored. If one was hit, he would die without a doubt.</p><p>The goateed Emperor dodged with all his might, and in the end, Lu Ming managed to avoid his vital point between his eyebrows. However, he was unable to completely avoid it and was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The goateed Emperor controlled the other half of his body to retreat with fear on his face.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. I’m the Emperor of the MU family. If you kill me, the MU family will never let you off!”</p><p>The goateed man roared.</p><p>“You’re a great emperor, but you’re actually threatening me with the MU family at this time. What a joke!”</p><p>“You speak as if the MU family will let me off if 1 let you off. Just die!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His killing intent was extremely strong as he continued to attack the other party.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Battle Sword was as huge as a mountain and it crushed the void.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The goateed Emperor roared hysterically.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the sword pressed down, half of his body exploded. A soul roared and wanted to rush out, but it was crushed by the sword and exploded.</p><p>His soul was destroyed!</p><p>A great emperor had fallen!</p><p>At this moment, everyone who was fighting felt their hearts shake. It was hard for them to calm down.</p><p>A great emperor was at the peak of Mount Yuan. They were Supreme and ruled over an area. With a stomp of their feet, the entire Mount Yuan would shake.</p><p>Such a person was now dead. He was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, he was a two star great emperor!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The morale of Phoenix Palace and the other top ten forces was greatly boosted.</p><p>As for the wind race, the purple Extreme sect, and the WAN family, their morale was greatly reduced. This way, they were even more outmatched and were constantly killed.</p><p>Emperor tianluo was also shocked.</p><p>He was originally no match for uncle Kong, and now that he was struck by uncle Kong’s sword, he immediately spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Emperor tianluo used all his power to rush out.</p><p>He had successfully rushed out, turning into a rainbow light and running for his life.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a cold glint as he threw the celestial Thearch’s sword in his hand.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword turned into a beam of light and flew toward Emperor tianluo at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Emperor tianluo roared and used all his strength to resist. He threw out Emperor weapons one after another, most of which were true Emperor weapons, hoping to block Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>As the sword light passed through, the monarch weapons exploded one by one.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the end, the sword light hit the Emperor of tianluo and almost cut him in half. However, he managed to Dodge it and flew away.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Uncle Kong turned into a beam of sword light and chased after Emperor tianluo.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. He had used up too much energy to kill the goatee Emperor.</p><p>Now, the energy in Celestial Emperor’s body had dropped to less than ten percent. With this amount of energy, he might not be able to kill Emperor tianluo even if he went after him.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the goateed Emperor’s storage ring. At the same time, he recalled the celestial Thearch sword and walked towards the Wind Clan leader.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 surrender. The wind race will never be your enemy. I’m willing to compensate you with a large number of treasures!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Wind Clan was scared out of his wits when he saw Lu</p><p>Ming walking over. He shouted in fear..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
