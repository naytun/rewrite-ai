BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from the two of them, and a long river surrounded them.</p><p>Emperor-to-be, both of them were in the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>it’s one of the king path laws, the law of destruction. The two of them are the same!</p><p>Someone shouted, recognizing the laws of the two.</p><p>The two young men actually controlled the same laws.</p><p>“You’re also in control of the laws of destruction, but you’re not my match!”</p><p>One of them said confidently.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s defeated!”</p><p>The other person was also very confident.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>The two King physiques had both reached the Emperor-to-be realm, and their battle strength was very shocking.</p><p>Furthermore, they had grasped the same type of nomological law, and their cultivation levels were similar. Their combat strength was also not much different. The battle between the two was extremely intense, and it was only after more than two hundred rounds of fighting that the victor was decided.</p><p>In the end, one of them won by a slight margin and defeated his opponent, sending him flying off the stone platform.</p><p>After his victory, his stone platform flew back to the others, while the stone platform of the defeated person turned into dust and dissipated.</p><p>The defeated person was extremely unwilling. He had become the first person to be eliminated in the battle of the ten lands.</p><p>There was a simple rule for this competition.</p><p>That was, they could admit defeat before the competition.</p><p>If he didn’t admit defeat, he would be responsible for his own life and death once the battle started.</p><p>Of course, they could also rush down the stone platform and admit defeat.</p><p>After the first round of the competition ended, the stone platforms began to spin again. Soon, two more stone platforms flew towards the center and collided with each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two young men on the stone platform immediately started fighting.</p><p>Without a doubt, these were also two King physiques.</p><p>In fact, those who could enter the top 80 in each battle zone all had King physiques, and their cultivation wasn’t weak.</p><p>He cultivated in that corner of the world for another two years. Even the worst of them had entered the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Surprisingly, the two King physiques controlled the same laws.</p><p>Could it be because of the stone platform?</p><p>Lu Ming was reminded of the stone platform. Previously, when he stepped onto the stone platform, there was a wave of energy that enveloped him.</p><p>Could that energy sense the laws? Or perhaps, it had other uses.</p><p>Not only Lu Ming, but the others also had the same thought.</p><p>As expected, most of the people who were going to fight next had the same nomological laws.</p><p>This was to determine the winner between two people with the same laws.</p><p>so strong! They are all Emperor-to-be!</p><p>“And it’s at the stage where it’s about to evolve into a small world, and it’s about to verify its Dao and become an Emperor!”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>Indeed, in the past two years, everyone had made great progress. Many of them had not become Saint emperors, but they were close to it.</p><p>Some of the young men were especially envious.</p><p>There were some people whose cultivation levels were similar to theirs before, but now there was a huge gap.</p><p>Some of them were still stuck in the perfected absolute Saint realm. Even though a small number of them had broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm in the past two years, they were still far from being able to evolve a small world.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense. Each battle had a similar cultivation level and the laws were the same. It would take at least a hundred moves to determine the winner.</p><p>Half a day later, only ten pairs of people had started to fight.</p><p>In the eleventh match, Lu Ming saw a familiar face.</p><p>Long Chen!</p><p>Moreover, Long Chen had already broken through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>I’wo years ago, he had already reached the Emperor-to-be realm. It was normal for him to take this opportunity to break through.</p><p>His opponent was also at the Martial Emperor realm. He was also a person who had mastered the Supreme force law. The two of them began to collide with each other.</p><p>However, in the end, Long Chen had cultivated the Archean dragonesque elephant body, which made him more powerful. He defeated his opponent in a violent manner.</p><p>This was the first time that a battle of the same law and level had such a huge difference in strength.</p><p>“The bloodline of the top ten Battle Beasts is indeed extraordinary!”</p><p>indeed. It’s said that the further you advance, the more extraordinary you will be. After you reach the rank of a martial Supreme, you’ll be even stronger!</p><p>Some of the older generation were discussing.</p><p>The battle continued.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming saw desolate power, Luo Xiang, Qiu Yue, and the rest all enter the arena.</p><p>Huang Li, Luo Xiang, Qiu Yue, and the others had all broken through their shackles and reached the Martial Emperor realm. They were now one-star void emperors.</p><p>They had also defeated their opponents.</p><p>However, everyone could see that most of the duels were about the same nomological law, but it was not absolute. There were also duels between different nomological laws.</p><p>It was very exciting. Lu Ming’s eyes were dazzled because he saw all kinds of King path laws.</p><p>Today was indeed a great era. In the past, there were very few King path laws, but now they had all appeared.</p><p>The battles continued for several days, and people were eliminated one after another.</p><p>There were no rules for duels. It wasn’t like you could wait for the others to finish their duels before it was your turn.</p><p>Some people had just finished 10% of the battles, and after a few rounds, it was his turn again.</p><p>It was completely determined by the stone platform’s autonomous movement.</p><p>Some people were unlucky and met a terrifying heaven’s favorite right from the start.</p><p>For example, some people were defeated by Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, and ancient devil in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moll making a move.</p><p>After all, the two of them had only cultivated for a short period of time and were considered to be rising stars. They had not broken through to the martial Supreme realm, but they had already reached the stage of evolving a small world. They were only one step away from the martial Supreme realm. They would be able to break through after consolidating their strength for a while.</p><p>They had also easily defeated their opponents.</p><p>As the stone platform moved, Lu Ming drifted forward and collided with another stone platform.</p><p>Finally, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>Lu Ming’s first opponent was a King physique that was only at the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“Do you want to admit defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have much interest in a King body at the Emperor-to-be realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>“If you want me to admit defeat, we’ll have to see if you have the ability!”</p><p>The other party sneered. He was a young man wrapped in a black robe. His face was pale, and he took out a staff.</p><p>“Curse, weaken!”</p><p>“Curse, poison!”</p><p>“Curse, corrosion!”</p><p>The young man took action immediately. He waved his staff and streams of energy suddenly appeared on Lu Ming’s body, enveloping him.</p><p>“This is … The law of curses!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The law of curses was an extremely rare King path law. It was very strange and powerful. With the power of curses, it could kill people without them noticing.</p><p>There were waves of strange energy on his body, desperately drilling into Lu Ming’s body. An ordinary King’s body would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, this was nothing..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
