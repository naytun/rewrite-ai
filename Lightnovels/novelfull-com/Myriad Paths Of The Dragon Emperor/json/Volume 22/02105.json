All the talents who entered this world had great gains.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On a rock, a two or three-year-old girl’s aura rose dramatically, and her Emperor’s might spread out like the ocean.</p><p>Not long after, a lightning tribulation descended from the sky, but this little girl easily overcame it.</p><p>I’ve finally broken through to the martial Supreme realm, chirping!</p><p>The little girl mumbled. This little girl was bubbles.</p><p>In another Valley, the lightning tribulation was also rumbling. Not long after, the lightning tribulation disappeared and a young man’s figure appeared. It was Mu yang.</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura emanated from his body. It was the emperor’s might. He had also broken through and reached the Martial Emperor realm, hahaha! I’ve finally broken through to the martial Supreme realm! I’ll definitely turn that brat tianyun into ashes the next time 1 see him!</p><p>Mu yang laughed, full of confidence.</p><p>He had broken through to the martial Supreme realm and his abilities had increased tremendously. He was one hundred percent confident that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, he did not know that tianyun was Lu Ming. He only thought that it was tianyun.</p><p>Not only them, but many others had also broken through.</p><p>Royal River, Star River, death blade, and GE long …</p><p>The sons of God were originally in the Emperor-to-be realm, but after accumulating in this world for so long, they broke the shackles and stepped into the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Some of them even had a breakthrough in their King body and became martial sovereigns.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to break through from the Emperor-to-be realm to the Martial Emperor realm. It would take a long time to accumulate energy. It would take a long time to break through if it was in the outside world.</p><p>However, in this world, many people had broken through in just over a year.</p><p>This was a great opportunity.</p><p>Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, who had already reached the Martial Emperor realm, had taken a step further and become even stronger.</p><p>Everyone was improving, and their strength had increased greatly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had been one year and eight months since he had entered this world.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stopped cultivating.</p><p>He felt that his cultivation had reached its limit. He planned to slow down for a while and then try to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>the energy in this world is extremely abundant. I don’t know if there are any natural treasures here. Why don’t I take a look? ”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>Other people could not travel far, but he could, because his physical strength was too strong.</p><p>He wanted to walk around.</p><p>In particular, he found that the place was not flat and had a slope. He was in the middle of the slope and wanted to follow the slope to the top to take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming started to move. He followed the slope and went up.</p><p>The slope was not very steep but it was indeed going upward. Lu Ming realized that the higher he went, the greater the pressure.</p><p>Although the increase was not huge, it was indeed getting stronger slowly. However, Lu Ming’s physical strength was still able to withstand it.</p><p>Lu Ming walked along the slope for three days, but he did not discover anything. It was smooth everywhere and there were no living creatures. He did not see anyone coming in from the outside.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the people who came in from outside might be at the bottom of the slope.</p><p>Lu Ming walked for another day. He suddenly realized that the ground had become flat. He seemed to have reached the highest point.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were many protruding rocks in front of them, like small hills. Of course, there were also some mountain peaks, but there was no vegetation.</p><p>And here, the Qi of origin of heaven and earth seemed to be even denser.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward. He was still unwilling to give up and wanted to search.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at a Valley.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>When he entered the valley, Lu Ming was shocked because he saw two figures.</p><p>Two young men who looked to be in their twenties were sitting cross-legged there.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen these two people before.</p><p>They were not any two of the three hundred and twenty people who had entered.</p><p>When they were waiting on the destiny mountain, the 320 people had sized each other up. With their memory, they could remember each other after seeing each other once.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have any impression of these two young men.</p><p>One of the two young men was wearing a black robe, had black hair, and a cold expression.</p><p>The other young man had long purple hair and was extremely handsome. He had an indescribable temperament that people would not forget after one look. “Who are they? Why are you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled.</p><p>Other than the three hundred and twenty of them, there were others who had entered?</p><p>At the same time, the two young men also saw Lu Ming and looked at him in surprise.</p><p>“Who is he? I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>The black-haired youth said, his voice cold and arrogant.</p><p>The purple-haired young man’s eyes suddenly lit up. could it be a prodigy of the primordial realm? I’ve recently heard that there are some prodigies of the primordial realm that have entered this world to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to hear their conversation.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>The purple-haired young man said that he was a proud Son of Heaven of the primordial realm. Could it be that the purple-haired young man wasn’t from the primordial realm?</p><p>Could it be the heaven realm?</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of the heaven.</p><p>But why would someone from the heaven realm appear here?</p><p>“Where are you from? Heaven realm? Or the primordial realm?”</p><p>The black-haired youth seemed to be interested.</p><p>“Primordial realm, may 1 ask who you are?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>you’re indeed from the primordial realm. 1 didn’t expect someone from the primordial realm to be able to make it here. It looks like your cultivation isn’t weak. I’m really curious. What’s the cultivation of the primordial realm’s prodigies?”</p><p>The one who spoke was still the black-haired youth.</p><p>With that, the black-haired young man stood up, his eyes filled with fighting spirit as he walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. It seemed that these two people really came from the heaven realm.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was speechless. They had just met and this black-haired young man looked like he was about to fight.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black-haired young man stepped forward, and a powerful aura burst out of his body. It was Emperor pressure.</p><p>The black-haired young man was a Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Make your move, let me see your strength!”</p><p>The black-haired young man’s footsteps became faster and faster. In the end, he turned into a black lightning bolt and rushed toward Lu Ming. At the same time, he struck out with his palm. The terrifying power of his palm was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“The power of reincarnation, this is the Son of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This black-haired young man’s palm contained the law of reincarnation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move as well. He also struck out with his palm.</p><p>The two of them struck out with their palms, causing a loud boom that shook the entire Valley.</p><p>“Not bad, again!”</p><p>The black-haired young man continued to strike out with his palms. He struck out dozens of times in a row, and the power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the chaos laws to fight against his opponent. After dozens of moves, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>you’re just an Emperor-to-be, but you’re so powerful. Your body is so strong. That’s impossible. Are you an immemorial body cultivator? no, how can an immemorial body cultivator cultivate laws?”</p><p>The black-robed youth continued to speak, his voice filled with surprise.</p><p>Even the purple-haired young man looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“This guy is so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also rather shocked.</p><p>With his current physical body and Saint energy, as well as his Perfect Chaos laws, his combat power was definitely terrifying. However, he could not do anything to this young man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
