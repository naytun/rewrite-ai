They were the last three young men who had been defeated by Tianming, Yuan Xin, and Bao de respectively.</p><p>The other two people were recognized by everyone. They were also the two people who had met Tian Ming and Yuan Xin.</p><p>A total of five people.</p><p>“What do you have to say?”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked.</p><p>among the ten of them, some of them are not strong enough to enter the top ten!</p><p>that’s right. They’re just lucky. They didn’t meet any strong opponents, so they’re not convinced!</p><p>The young men spoke one after another.</p><p>Everyone understood!</p><p>These young men felt that they were too unlucky to have met Tianming, Yuan Xin, and the others. They had been defeated because Tianming and the others were too strong.</p><p>Among the current top 10, many people had not met Tianming and the others. Therefore, these young men thought that they had lost because of luck and not because of strength.</p><p>Many people had the same thought. Their gazes were especially fixed on Lu Ming, bubbles, and Xinghe.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded and said,” the stone platform under your feet has a special function, so some people did not encounter it in advance. However, 1 believe that you will not be convinced without a fight. How about this? 1 will give you a chance. You can challenge any one of the ten people. If you win, you can replace them!</p><p>As soon as he said that, the young men’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At the same time, their gazes landed on Lu Ming, bubbles, and Xing Chen. They were filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>In fact, they were not convinced by Lu Ming and the other two. They believed that they were stronger than Lu Ming, bubbles, and Xing Chen.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had mastered two ultimate maxims, he was only an Emperor-to-be after all. Although he had defeated Muyang before, which one of them was not stronger than him?</p><p>There was also bubbles, a three to four year old child. She was only a one-star void Emperor, so they were not afraid.</p><p>The same was true for the eternal Star River. It was only a one-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>As for the ancient devil, although it was equivalent to a one-star void Emperor, it cultivated the immemorial devil Dao and had extremely powerful combat strength. They were not confident.</p><p>As for Tian Ming, Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, Bao de, ao ke, and Yun Haoge, they didn’t even consider them. These six people had already become divine emperors two years ago, and they were unfathomable now.</p><p>“I’ll start the challenge!”</p><p>A red-haired young man stepped out.</p><p>why should you be the one to challenge first? I’ll go first!</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>There were a total of five young men, and they all shouted loudly, wanting to challenge him first.</p><p>The first to challenge would definitely have the advantage, and they could choose the weakest.</p><p>In the end, the white-haired old man asked them to draw lots to decide who would go first.</p><p>In the end, a tall and thin young man drew the first to fight.</p><p>Previously, this person had been defeated by Bao de. Now, he was the first to challenge him. His gaze scanned Lu Ming, bubbles, and Xinghe before finally landing on Xinghe.</p><p>“You train in the eternal laws as well. Come out and fight!”</p><p>The tall, skinny youth said. He also trained in the eternal laws.</p><p>“I was just about to fight you!”</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes were bright as he stepped forward, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>The two of them both trained in the eternal laws.</p><p>The two of them were not the only geniuses who cultivated in the eternal laws, but they were undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them began to fight. Eternal laws constantly collided with each other, and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>In the beginning, the two were evenly matched. After exchanging more than a hundred moves, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>However, after more than 100 moves, the Galaxy began to gain the upper hand and suppressed the other party.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Galaxy roared, its aura was wild, its long hair danced in the wind, and its eyes were as bright as the stars.</p><p>Back then, he had been defeated by Lu Ming. He had been lying low and cultivating with all his heart. He had finally transformed and was stronger than before.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng clan laughed heartily. He was extremely carefree.</p><p>After a few dozen more moves, Xing Chen sent his opponent flying off the stone platform and won.</p><p>The first challenge had ended in failure, causing the remaining young challengers to have grave expressions.</p><p>Originally, in their eyes, Xinghe was the weakest person, but he still failed the challenge.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn!”</p><p>The red-haired young man who had been defeated by Tianming stepped forward and his gaze landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come out and fight!”</p><p>The young man with long fiery red hair fixed his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>“And you thought 1 was a pushover!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. With a thought, the stone platform under his feet flew forward and the red-haired young man landed on the stone platform.</p><p>A stone platform was equivalent to a battle platform.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re not a great emperor yet. Although you’ve mastered two ultimate maxims, I can still defeat you …</p><p>The young man with long red hair clamored, trying to provoke Lu Ming.</p><p>“Blowing!”</p><p>Before the fiery-red long-haired young man could finish his sentence, Lu Ming had already rushed at him. He used the chaos laws and the array Dao laws. The two laws merged and he used the chaos Divine palm to strike at the fiery-red long-haired young man.</p><p>The red-haired young man exploded and used all his strength to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fusion of the chaos laws and the array Dao laws was more powerful than the fusion of the death laws and the array Dao laws. After all, the chaos Divine palm was a divine power Technique of the chaos laws.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attacks were like a storm, continuously attacking the red-haired young man.</p><p>In an instant, he had struck out hundreds of palms.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After over a hundred collisions, the red-haired young man’s arm went numb and was almost broken.</p><p>His body trembled continuously as he retreated.</p><p>From the beginning of the fight, he had been suppressed by Lu Ming and was completely at a disadvantage. It was difficult for him to resist and in the end, he retreated from the stone platform.</p><p>you still dare to challenge me? you’re not that great? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and flew back along with the stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the fusion of the chaos law and the death law. Could it be that he really did not fuse the two laws together? ”</p><p>it’s naturally not that easy to fuse two ultimate maxims. However, even so, his strength is still very strong, slightly stronger than Xinghe!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>The remaining challengers ‘expressions turned even uglier.</p><p>Even the weakest among them had such strength. Could it be that they would not succeed in their challenge?</p><p>Then, a young man challenged bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles still did not reveal her true form. Using the mysterious and unpredictable space-time laws, she ‘played’ with her opponent for a hundred to two hundred moves. In the end, she also inexplicably sent her opponent off the stone platform and won.</p><p>The other two challengers looked at each other, sighed, shook their heads, and gave up the challenge.</p><p>Even Lu Ming, bubbles, and Xinghe were so powerful. If they were to challenge the remaining people, they would not have the confidence to do so. They would only be abused. It was better not to challenge them.</p><p>At this point, the top ten were officially born.</p><p>After a round of challenges, no one doubted Lu Ming and the rest’s combat strength anymore. They were worthy of their name. They were the top ten strongest among the younger generation in yuanlu.</p><p>The ten of them sized each other up and collided with each other, creating a brilliant flame.</p><p>Yuan Xin, in particular, glanced at Lu Ming with a cold and sharp gaze..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
