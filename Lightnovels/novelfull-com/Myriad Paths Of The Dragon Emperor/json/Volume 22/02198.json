It’s a good thing that the passageway has collapsed. Otherwise, it would have been really dangerous!</p><p>Dandan’s expression turned serious, which was rare. Then, she glanced at Lu Ming and said,”You’re saying that you’re in control of multiple laws? Show me!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Instantly, the laws in it spread out.</p><p>Dandan was dumbfounded, with a dazed expression.</p><p>After a long time, dandan finally reacted.</p><p>nest, seven maxims and two ultimate maxims. How did you do it? ”</p><p>Dandan said with her eyes wide open.</p><p>“So what if there are seven types of laws? Unfortunately, it’s hard to become a saint Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>it’s indeed difficult to become a saint Emperor. You’re a peerless cripple!</p><p>Dandan muttered and sighed.</p><p>“Dandan, you’re always bragging. Don’t you know there’s a way for me to become a saint Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s bragging! When did I brag?”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes widened in anger, then she frowned and thought carefully.</p><p>After a long while, dandan said,” there have been people like you in the history of the heaven realm who have mastered many types of nomological laws below the martial Supreme realm. However, in the end, no one became a martial Supreme. Everyone failed. They either died on the way to a breakthrough by force or died due to the exhaustion of their lifespans!</p><p>“Is there really no other way? I can’t accept this!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>“Actually, it’s not that there’s no way!”</p><p>Dandan said again.</p><p>“Is there really a way?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>in the ancient times, 1 knew a man. He was a peerless genius, a rare one. He was ambitious and wanted to walk a new path, a path that no one in the ancient times had ever walked!</p><p>I don’t know how he cultivated. Later on, before he became a Saint Emperor, he had mastered many laws. He was invincible among those at the same level. No one was his match!</p><p>unfortunately, his path was cut off and he could not become a Martial Emperor no matter what he did. He spent his entire life studying the secret to becoming a Martial Emperor. It was said that he finally made great progress in his later years, but it was too late. He did not have much time left and his potential had been exhausted. In the end, he died of exhaustion!</p><p>“As long as you know the method he researched, it might help you become a saint Emperor!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>it’s been countless years since the ancient times. How can we find his method? H</p><p>Lu Ming asked. He was not sure.</p><p>After all, so many years had passed. According to dandan, the evil god tribe had not attacked the heaven realm yet.</p><p>that man’s family is still here. They live in seclusion somewhere in the Tai Qing heavenly region. When we leave this place, I will take you there. Don’t worry. I will treat you well if you follow me!</p><p>Dandan had a proud look on her face.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to argue with dandan. At that moment, he was overjoyed.</p><p>There was finally a way. As long as he found the method left behind by that senior, perhaps he could really break the shackles and become a Dao Emperor. “When are we going out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>don’t worry, this is the most famous battlefield in ancient times. There was a terrible war between the heaven realm and the alien race, and many masters died here. Although so many years have passed, there must be some peerless treasures left. It is a rare opportunity, we can’t miss it. We will leave after we collect all the treasures here!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was not in a hurry.</p><p>“Dandan, you didn’t also participate in the battle here back then, did you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“No, I’m at another battlefield. It’s even more tragic there!”</p><p>Dandan said. She seemed to have recalled something but did not say anything else.</p><p>The two of them flew all the way, and after a few hours, dandan suddenly stopped.</p><p>He landed on the ground, and countless symbols spread out from under his feet. After a while, he revealed a happy expression, and said,” there’s something up ahead. Haha, do it!</p><p>Having said that, he sprinted madly with Lu Ming following closely behind.</p><p>After crossing a few Hills, they saw two skeletons under a cliff.</p><p>One of the skeletons was the skeleton of a huge beast. It seemed to have been left behind by a Tiger-shaped divine beast.</p><p>The other skeleton was in the form of an adult, but it had a huge body that was four to five meters tall.</p><p>The human skeleton held a long spear and pierced through the beast skeleton’s skull. The beast skeleton’s claw cracked the human skeleton’s skull.</p><p>It was clear that the human-shaped skeleton was an expert from the evil god tribe, while the beast-shaped skeleton was a divine beast.</p><p>The two experts had died together.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were burning as she looked at the spear in the skeleton’s hand.</p><p>In addition, there was a fist-sized crystal under the beast-shaped skeleton.</p><p>the realm core, haha, so many years have passed, and the realm core is still preserved. As long as it still contains a trace of energy, it’s a great opportunity!</p><p>Dandan grinned and laughed.</p><p>However, the two of them didn’t get close. The things left behind by such a person would probably contain killing intent and would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Dandan stomped on the ground, and endless runes spread out. At the same time, he kept waving his hands, and countless runes also flashed.</p><p>this contains the laws of array Dao, alchemy Dao, and craftsmanship Dao …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Dandan’s rune was very profound. It actually combined the three types of laws derived from the Dao of inscription. Furthermore, it was a perfect combination and was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Dandan flickered in the surrounding area, and countless runes sank into the ground.</p><p>After a moment, dandan returned and said,” “Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ground glowed, and countless runes appeared, forming large characters.</p><p>It was the word ‘exterminate’.</p><p>These demons of destruction flew towards the spear and the world-core.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the word touched the spear, the spear crumbled and turned into dust.</p><p>unfortunately, it has lost all its spirituality and has become useless!</p><p>Dandan shook her head, but the next moment, her eyes lit up.</p><p>That was because the world-core suddenly burst out with light.</p><p>“Kill!…”</p><p>Indistinctly, one could hear battle cries coming from the world core.</p><p>The experts who had died here were all too powerful. Even after such a long time, there was still an undying killing intent.</p><p>An ordinary expert would definitely not be able to do so.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The word ‘exterminate’ covered the world core and began to obliterate the killing intent in it.</p><p>The function of such a formation was very similar to the formation that the evil god race had set up previously. It was able to wipe out the killing intent left behind by experts.</p><p>Not long after, the battle cries from the world core disappeared, and the light on it also dimmed.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Dandan was overjoyed. She grabbed the fist-sized world core in the air and grabbed it.</p><p>Dandan carefully sensed it and said with some pity,” “So many years have passed. The energy is almost exhausted, but it’s still very useful. Lu Ming, you haven’t become a great emperor yet. It won’t be of much use to give you the world core. I’ll keep it!”</p><p>Done talking, dandan was not polite at all and directly put it away..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
