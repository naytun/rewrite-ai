The fusion of the five types of laws caused a commotion.</p><p>Many people could not remain calm. Lu Ming had no limits.</p><p>Now there were five, but no one was sure if he would reveal six later.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moii were so excited that they jumped up and down.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming crossed the void and was close to his destiny in an instant.</p><p>Tianming’s pupils contracted, his eyes extremely serious. His body was almost fused with the river of fate, becoming illusory.</p><p>At the same time, he continuously pointed at the shadow.</p><p>This time, he pointed at the center of the Shadow’s eyebrows.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Shadow’s glabella was pierced through. Lu Ming, who was charging at him, encountered a terrifying attack. An extremely sharp force attacked Lu Ming s glabella.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had fused five types of laws, his combat strength had increased greatly. The laws vibrated and blocked the force. Then, Lu Ming struck our with his palm and bombarded the incoming force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom erupted and the void trembled continuously. The force that was used to attack Lu Ming was very shocking, but it was still defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eat my finger and see!’1</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward and pointed his finger at the same time.</p><p>The energy of heaven and earth exploded, forming a giant chaotic finger of tribulation that crushed toward the destiny River.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>This time, the river of fate couldn’t resist the power of the finger of tribulation of chaos. The river was rolling and shaking, and thousands of waves were raised.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the finger of tribulation of chaos pressed down, the river of fate seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Stadium was silent. Many people didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. This was because they knew that this was the most crucial moment. It was the moment where victory and defeat would be decided.</p><p>Who would win?</p><p>“River of fate slash!”</p><p>Tianming howled. He was absorbing the power of the river of fate, turning into a ray of light and slashing at the finger of tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion occurred in the sky. The light from the Heaven’s Will slash blocked the chaos finger of tribulation and dissipated.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed a few more times. Endless energy gathered and a total of three fingers of tribulation of chaos blasted toward Tianming.</p><p>Tianming could only try his best to resist.</p><p>The situation had been completely reversed.</p><p>Just now, when Tianming cast the river of fate, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage. But now, Tianming was at a disadvantage again. The situation changed rapidly. boom! boom! boom!</p><p>With another three rumbles, the three fingers of tribulation were blocked, but Tianming’s figure retreated rapidly. The river of fate shook, and the light became a little dim.</p><p>“You’ve broken through my defense!”</p><p>Tianming roared.</p><p>you’re still so confident even now. Til break your confidence then!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air and clenched his fist. A huge sword light condensed in the air.</p><p>The sword of death!</p><p>This was a killing move that Lu Ming had created himself. It contained four types of laws-death, devour, array Dao and extremity.</p><p>This wasn’t a simple fusion of laws. Instead, it was a magical power Technique that was constructed by unleashing the various uses of the four laws.</p><p>This kind of sacred art was much more powerful than the simple fusion of laws.</p><p>Although Lu Ming could only unleash the magical effects of the four types of laws at rhe initial stage, he could nor stop it. This divine power had become one of Lu Ming’s strongest killing moves.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and slashed his sword.</p><p>This sword directly cut open the void and cut rhe heavenly fate.</p><p>Tianming tried his best to block it, bur ir was useless. His River of fate trembled madly and was cut in two by the sword of death. Then, it exploded.</p><p>Tianming retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood stained his snow-white robe.</p><p>Tianming had been injured. The river of fate had been broken, and he had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He used the finger of tribulation of chaos and pointed at Tianming with several huge fingers.</p><p>Tianming had not been thrown our of the battle stage, nor had he admitted defeat. The battle had not ended.</p><p>Tianming was unwilling to give up and tried his best to resist. However, he had been severely injured and his combat strength had weakened. Moreover, the river of fate had been cut off. He could not fight against Lu Ming at all.</p><p>After a few moves, he was sent flying a hundred miles away. He spat our a large mouthful of blood and his face was pale.</p><p>He had already been sent flying out of the fighting ring!</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the middle of the fighting ring and spoke indifferently.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The heavenly mandate had lost!</p><p>The audience was silent at first, but when they came to their senses, they were in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming is really heaven-defying. He defeated Tianming with his</p><p>Emperor-to-be cultivation!</p><p>the legend of the law of fate has been broken. Fate can be broken, and man can conquer nature!</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. No one had expected that destiny would be defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated Tianming and stood at the peak.</p><p>In the beginning, no one thought highly of Lu Ming. When they found our that Lu Ming had not broken through to the martial Supreme realm, they were even ridiculed by Muyang. At that time, no one would have thought that Lu Ming would be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>No one would have expected that Lu Ming would come in first!</p><p>my master is invincible! I knew my master was invincible!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang jumped up in excitement, not forgetting to look at rhe elders nearby.</p><p>The few elders were also dazed. When they saw Lu Xiangxiangs eyes, they could nor help but blush.</p><p>“Young master is so amazing!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, Luo Tianyi, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others were also smiling.</p><p>The death blade looked at Lu Ming in silence.</p><p>On the other hand, Heng Xinghe s face was extremely gloomy and even had a trace of fear. Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his imagination. If Lu Ming had used his full strength, he could have killed him in one move.</p><p>“Brother Wuxiang, brother Kong, brother Heng, brother he, I heard that this Lu Ming came from Mount Yuan. I didn’t expect that Mount Yuan would produce such a heaven’s favorite. Congratulations!”</p><p>Some of the great emperors congratulated uncle Kong, Emperor formless, the great emperors of the Heng clan, and the he clan.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Uncle Kong and Emperor notionless laughed heartily.</p><p>Great emperors he and Heng snorted coldly with extremely gloomy expressions.</p><p>They could not wait to slap Lu Ming to death. It would be strange if they looked happy when other people congratulated them.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The ones with the ugliest expressions were rhe Heng family, the he family, and of course, the Gu Yue Holy Land’s golden Crow clan, the WAN family, and other forces.</p><p>Their faces turned pale. Lu Ming s talent was too terrifying. If Lu Ming continued to grow, they would all be annihilated in the future.</p><p>When they thought of this, they were terrified.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yuan Xin bellowed. He was not willing to accept that Lu Ming had actually gotten first place.</p><p>Tianming was also unwilling to give up. His eyes flashed sharply, but he eventually calmed down.</p><p>alright, rhe battle of the ten lands has ended!</p><p>The white-haired old man walked our and said with a smile.</p><p>now, I will announce rhe names of the top ten in rhe batrle of the ten lands!</p><p>“First place, Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Second place, Tianming!”</p><p>“Third place, Yuan Xin!”</p><p>Then, the white-haired old man announced the rankings..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
