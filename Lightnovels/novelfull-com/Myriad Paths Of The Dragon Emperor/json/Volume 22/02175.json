Their auras spread out, revealing their Level 3 Martial Emperor cultivation.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He was not bothered by the third level Martial Emperor.</p><p>you two want to take over the East continent? no way!</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace was a purple-haired middle-aged man. He sneered.</p><p>The divine ox Palace was the first power of the yuan continent to arrive in the East barren. Therefore, it occupied the place with the densest original Qi in the East barren.</p><p>The sovereign family and the manlong temple had always wanted to take over the East barren, but they had never succeeded.</p><p>This time, the sovereign race and the manlong Palace had joined forces to pressure the divine ox Palace. That was why they had said that they would fight today.</p><p>“Where did the divine ox Palace and the barbaric Dragon Palace come from?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows in deep thought.</p><p>These two factions definitely did not come from the Azure continent. They came to the divine wilderness through other means.</p><p>“You’ll know once you compete. At that time, don’t go back on your word, divine ox Palace!”</p><p>Sakra gave a faint smile.</p><p>“How can my divine ox Palace be shameless? tell me, how do you want to compete this time?”</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace said.</p><p>how are we going to compete? we have already agreed on this a long time ago. There is no need for us to fight. Both sides will send out their local elites to fight. How about this, each side will send out three elites and have a team battle and an individual battle. We will rank them according to their battle results. How about it? ”</p><p>Sakra said.</p><p>“Alright, it’s decided then!”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace and the manlong Palace Master both nodded in agreement.</p><p>Not long after, a fighting stage rose in the middle of the square. Three young men from each of the three forces rushed into the arena.</p><p>“Ren qianxing, Ren qianxing!”</p><p>“Ren qianxing!”</p><p>Naturally, the sovereign race sent out Ren qianxing. The moment he stepped onto the stage, many people, including a few ignorant young ladies, started shouting.</p><p>Ren qianxing indeed had the looks of a dog and a graceful demeanor. Many ignorant young ladies didn’t even know how to differentiate between good and evil and brainlessly treated Ren qianxing as their idol.</p><p>Ren qianxing stood with his hands behind his back, exuding the air of a peerless expert.</p><p>nest, he’s really acting tough. I can’t wait to step on his face!</p><p>Kong Jin said unhappily.</p><p>“You’ll have a chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>I’m just unhappy with those brainless young ladies. Ren qianxing has everything he wants. How can he compare to me? those ladies really have no taste!</p><p>Kong Jin pursed his lips. Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“Brother ox, how about we join forces? that Ren qianxing is not easy to deal with!”</p><p>The master of manlong Hall secretly sent a message to the master of divine ox Palace.</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace’s eyes flashed and he said,” alright, let’s join forces and defeat the monarch race first. Then, we’ll see who’s stronger! “Alright, that’s what 1 meant!”</p><p>The manlong Dragon Hall Master nodded.</p><p>After that, the master of manlong Hall and divine ox Palace sent messages to their respective heaven’s favorites.</p><p>At this moment, on the fighting ring, the paragons of the three sides were facing each other.</p><p>Many people were watching nervously.</p><p>From the discussions of the surrounding people, he knew that the nine youths on the battle stage were nine of the top ten elites of the divine wilderness continent. Every single one of them had extremely high cultivation levels.</p><p>Over at the sovereign race’s side, Ren qianxing and Li Ke were both present.</p><p>At this moment, the heaven’s favorites from the divine ox Palace and the Savage Dragon Palace looked at each other and suddenly moved.</p><p>The six young men from both sides charged at the sovereign race genius from two different directions.</p><p>“Damn it, they want to join forces to deal with us first!”</p><p>Li Ke roared.</p><p>“You guys are despicable!”</p><p>Another sovereign race heaven’s favorite roared.</p><p>However, the heaven’s favorites from both sides were extremely fast. They approached in an instant and attacked.</p><p>Li Ke and the other heaven’s favorite roared and charged forward.</p><p>However, Ren qianxing continued to stand with his hands behind his back, not moving an inch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, how could Li Ke and the other young man stop each other? they were knocked back and blood flowed out of their mouths.</p><p>The six youths from the divine ox Palace and Savage Dragon Palace had Ren qianxing surrounded.</p><p>“Ren qianxing, you guys should just admit defeat!”</p><p>One of the heaven’s favorites from the divine ox Palace said. He was ranked second among the top ten heaven’s favorites and had the cultivation of the third stage of half-Saint.</p><p>“Admit defeat? How laughable, you think trash like you can defeat me?”</p><p>Ren qianxing indifferently replied.</p><p>you’re boasting shamelessly. Then I’ll make you get out of here now!</p><p>The chosen roared, and the six of them exploded with powerful auras.</p><p>They were all half-Saints, and the weakest one was at the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, at this moment, a fearsome aura burst forth from Ren qianxing’s body. A vast amount of saintly might permeated the entire area.</p><p>At this moment, Ren qianxing’s bright Saint stage cultivation was fully revealed.</p><p>sage realm! You’ve broken through to the sage realm!</p><p>you’ve actually broken through to the sage realm!</p><p>The six heaven’s favorites from the two forces shouted in disbelief.</p><p>this guy has actually broken through to the sage realm!</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou and Zhuang xiaorou were also surprised.</p><p>The Saint realm was a barrier that was very difficult to cross.</p><p>For example, the fatty was empty. Without Lu Ming’s help, he would have needed a long time to cross.</p><p>At this moment, the crowd in the surroundings was in an uproar. They were all shocked by Ren qianxing’s cultivation base.</p><p>Those ignorant girls were even shouting and screaming in excitement.</p><p>“Now, you’re the ones who have lost!”</p><p>Ren qianxing let out a long howl as streaks of sword light burst forth from his hands.</p><p>His master was sakra, so he naturally also cultivated divine arts, which were extremely powerful.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the two forces were unable to fight back. They were sent flying by the sword light. They fell to the ground and spat out blood.</p><p>A half-Saint was no match for a Saint.</p><p>The paragons of the two forces were defeated in an instant. There was no longer any suspense in the competition.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace roared in anger, his face gloomy.</p><p>The entire arena was in an uproar as countless people were cheering for Ren qianxing.</p><p>amazing, this is really amazing. Ren qianxing has already reached the sage realm at such a young age. This is simply heaven-defying!</p><p>that’s right. As expected of the number one genius in the divine wilderness. It’s rare since ancient times!</p><p>someone actually placed Lu Ming and Ren qianxing on the same level. In my opinion, Lu Ming and Ren qianxing can’t be compared at all. They’re not on the same level at all. Lu Ming is far inferior!</p><p>“Not bad, not bad!”</p><p>The sounds of discussion rang out all around the square.</p><p>“Damn it, what do these people know? How do you know how powerful shizun is!”</p><p>“That’s right, a bunch of foolish people!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were very unhappy.</p><p>These people actually said that Lu Ming was far inferior to Ren qianxing. It was simply ridiculous. They knew how powerful Lu Ming was. In just three short months, he was able to make their abilities soar. He was many times stronger than Ren qianxing.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not mind.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, why would he care about the discussions of these people?</p><p>Many people sighed. They reckoned that there was no longer any suspense in this competition. The sovereign race would definitely win.</p><p>Sakra Azia was all smiles. In order to help Ren qianxing break through to the sage realm, he had paid a huge price. However, everything was worth it.</p><p>The cultivation environment in the East barren was too good. As long as he could occupy the East barren, he planned to move the entire di family here and make this place his base camp. Then, his di family would certainly grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the future, it wasn’t impossible for them to compete with the powerful forces of the sacred lands..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
