There were no fluctuations of laws, but no one doubted the power of this claw. It could definitely tear a one-star void Emperor apart easily.</p><p>I m a rice-haired man, so stubborn. Be careful, or I’ll catch you and stew you with wine!</p><p>The monk shouted.</p><p>The crowd looked at each other. Lu Ming and Long Chen looked at him with disdain again. This was probably the unscrupulous monk’s true thoughts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The monk s body was covered in golden light. Behind him, a golden Buddha statue appeared. The monk stood on the head of the Buddha statue. The Buddha statue waved its hand, and a hand as big as a small mountain smashed toward creak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying vibration was heard as the two exchanged a blow and were evenly matched.</p><p>“Demon God nine strikes!”</p><p>Ao ke let out a long roar and displayed the terrifying attack technique of the immemorial demonic Dao. His body glowed, and his five dragon claws attacked continuously. Each move was extremely terrifying, as it could tear the void and shatter the earth.</p><p>Fortunately, this battle platform was made by a great emperor and was indestructible. No matter how they fought, they couldn’t destroy it.</p><p>“Buddhist Kingdom in the palm!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, with a solemn expression, displayed rhe great Divine Art of Buddhism. He stretched out his hand, and a palm stretched out. It grew rapidly and pressed toward ao ke.</p><p>There seemed to be a Buddhist Kingdom in his palm with 3000 golden Arhats chanting Sutras. The golden light was more dazzling than the sun.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The cultivation of the unscrupulous monk and ao ke had both reached the two-star void Emperor realm. They were extremely powerful when they fought with all their might.</p><p>The Dragon s Roar shook rhe sky, and the sound of chanting Sutras resounded throughout the Mountain of Destiny.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight, exchanging dozens of moves.</p><p>what a terrifying battle strength! With such battle strength, I’m afraid that even an ordinary three-star void Emperor would be torn apart in an instant!</p><p>An illusionary Emperor said with a solemn expression.</p><p>he’s only just broken through to the martial Supreme realm and hasn’t even comprehended any other laws, yet he’s already so terrifying!</p><p>The others also sighed.</p><p>In the Martial Emperor realm, there were many factors that determined one’s fighting strength. However, it was truly shocking to have such fighting strength after breaking through to the void Emperor realm only a few years ago.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle. They used all kinds of Sacred Arts as they began a peak battle.</p><p>This was the fiercest battle since the competition for the top ten. The two of them were evenly matched, and it was difficult to determine the winner in a short time. The battle lasted for more than two hundred rounds.</p><p>I m the reincarnation of a Buddha God. Little bug, come and protect me. In the future, you’ll have good food and drinks. If you have my meat to eat, you’ll have your soup to drink!</p><p>The heartless monk shouted as he fought.</p><p>Pinker was so angry that his nose was almost crooked. He was a purple-gold true dragon, a Royal among true dragons, yet he was called a little worm.</p><p>Also, aren’t the Buddhists vegetarians? why the hell are you eating meat?</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>Some of the Buddhist cultivators who were watching the battle looked solemn as they chanted the name of Buddha, it seemed that… He was a little embarrassed.</p><p>However, although unscrupulous was not reliable, his battle prowess was indeed unbelievably strong, which made people feel terrified.</p><p>From the start of rhe battle until now, his body had bloomed with thousands of rays of Buddhist light. It seemed as if he was getting more and more courageous as the battle progressed. It was as if the Buddha God had really turned around, and his Dharma was boundless.</p><p>Many people were indignant. This guy was so unreliable, but his Buddhist divine arts were unbelievably strong. It really made people envious, jealous, and hateful.</p><p>The battle continued, and both of them were injured.</p><p>The scales on Cheke’s body fell off, and it was covered in blood.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was scratched by the Dragon Claw. A few hideous claw marks appeared, and one of his arms was almost torn off.</p><p>It was a tragic battle.</p><p>you’re too ruthless. Be careful of retribution!</p><p>The heartless man shouted, but he was more ruthless than anyone else. He used all kinds of Buddhist divine powers to hit ao ke’s body, causing a large number of scales to fall.</p><p>these scales are treasures and can’t be wasted. There’s also dragon blood. I’ll take it back and make soup!</p><p>During the battle, the monk did not forget to take the opportunity to collect the Dragon scales and dragon blood.</p><p>Creak was so angry that his lungs almost exploded. He attacked crazily.</p><p>In his anger, he finally revealed a flaw, and the unscrupulous monk seized the opportunity to launch a series of ruthless attacks, causing him to spit our large mouthfuls of blood and retreat.</p><p>In a battle between experts, one step behind would lead to another step behind. Once Pinker was at a disadvantage, it was difficult to reverse the situation. He began to be suppressed and finally was thrown out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Wu Liang won this round!</p><p>I’m a rice-haired man. You’ve let me win, you’ve let me win. That… About the protector that I mentioned before, please consider it…</p><p>The unscrupulous monk’s eyes were glued to Chek. He fantasized about how cool it would be if he had a purple-gold true dragon as his Mount.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Creak roared.</p><p>“You and 1 are really fated!”</p><p>He shouted again.</p><p>“F * eking fate …”</p><p>Creak spat out another mouthful of blood, transformed into his human form, and ran to the side to heal.</p><p>“Little girl, you and 1 are fated to meet!”</p><p>The heartless monk stared at bubbles and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked the monk’s face.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re too cruel. I’m already injured and you still attacked me. 1’11 go and recuperate first!”</p><p>The monk chuckled and retreated to the side to recuperate.</p><p>“Next match, heavenly fate, brutal virtue!”</p><p>The white – haired old man announced.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up, including Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Tianming was going to fight against Bao de.</p><p>Everyone was very curious about what kind of sacred art Tianming would use in this battle.</p><p>Previously, Tianming had defeated his opponent without taking a single step. But now, facing Bao de, could he do it?</p><p>Bao de was an immemorial body cultivator. His strength was extremely powerful, and he was definitely not weaker than ao ke and Wu Liang.</p><p>It would not be easy to defeat Bao de.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Bao de landed heavily on the fighting ring. His dark skin was flowing with black light, full of power.</p><p>He was three meters tall, like an iron tower.</p><p>Tianming, come, let’s fight, i want to see how you can control my fate with your fate laws!</p><p>Bao de shouted. His voice was like thunder, rumbling.</p><p>your fate has already been decided. You will be defeated!</p><p>Tianming stepped down from the sky, his white clothes fluttering, like a banished immortal descending to the mortal world, and landed on the battle platform.</p><p>whether you’re defeated or not isn’t something that you can decide with just your words. Show me your strength!</p><p>Bao de shouted. Then, he took a step forward and rushed toward Tianming like a giant beast.</p><p>“You are destined to be struck by lightning!”</p><p>Tianming said with a gentle smile.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, endless thunder and lightning appeared out of thin air and struck towards Bao de.</p><p>Bao de didn’t care and allowed the lightning to strike his body. He rushed past it and was completely fine.</p><p>The lightning could not break through his defense at all.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got? are you trying to scratch my itch?”</p><p>Bao de grinned. He didn’t stop and rushed toward Tian Ming. He punched out, shaking the void. A fist force was sent toward Tian Ming.</p><p>“It’s destined that you won’t be able to hit me!”</p><p>Tianming said indifferently.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene happened. The fist force crushed over and rushed through Tianming’s body. Tianming’s body was like an illusion. The fist force rushed through him, but he was fine..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
