The law of fate was too invincible!</p><p>He said that he was destined not to be hit, but the other party really couldn’t hit him!</p><p>How could they fight?</p><p>“It’s just that Bao de’s attack power isn’t strong enough. If it was strong enough, it could directly break the law of fate!”</p><p>An expert explained to everyone.</p><p>“It’s destined that you’ll be burned!”</p><p>“It’s destined that you’ll be cut by a blade!”</p><p>Tianming continued to speak very quickly.</p><p>Then, all kinds of attacks fell from the sky and bombarded Bao de.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Bao de waved his fist and instantly destroyed these attacks.</p><p>“I’ve been burning my body with flames and refining my body with lightning since 1 was young. Your attack can only scratch my itch!”</p><p>Bao de’s battle intent grew stronger and stronger. He broke through the layers of attacks and rapidly approached the heavenly mandate realm.</p><p>His muscles wriggled and his bones cracked as he punched out with all his might.</p><p>The power of this punch was even more shocking and powerful than the previous one.</p><p>At this time, Tianming’s face finally became a little serious. He pointed out a finger and said,” “Destiny said, absolute defense!”</p><p>A white wall of light appeared in front of him, and Bao de’s fist force hit the wall of light, causing a terrifying boom that shook the entire fighting ring, haha, you’ve finally made your move. It seems that your strength is also ordinary!</p><p>Bao de laughed and waved his fist, causing the light wall in front of Tianming to shake.</p><p>“Bao de, you are destined to be injured!”</p><p>Tianming spoke again. A bright light bloomed from his body as he pointed with his finger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Bao de roared. He seemed to have encountered an invisible and terrifying attack. His body trembled and he retreated a few steps, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>They didn’t see anything attack Bao de at all. They only said that Bao de was going to be injured, and Bao de was injured. This kind of method was too shocking and unimaginable.</p><p>your attack power is limited. If you have the ability, let’s see if you can kill me directly!</p><p>Bao de roared and once again rushed toward Tianming. His body swelled up, and his already burly body became even more shocking, like a giant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Bao de stomped heavily on the fighting ring, like a Black Lightning, like a demon mountain, and pressed toward Tianming.</p><p>it’s destined that you’ll be injured …</p><p>Tianming opened his mouth again and launched many mysterious attacks.</p><p>“Break, break, one force breaks all techniques!”</p><p>Bao de roared and kept punching out with both fists. The void was directly pierced through. The attacks of Tianming were also destroyed by Bao de one by one. He didn’t have any techniques on him.</p><p>Bao de’s strength is so terrifying. His strength is slightly above Wu Liang’s and ao ke’s!</p><p>he’s a natural-born primordial body cultivator. If such a person were to cultivate in a nomological system, he’d be a piece of trash. However, if he were to cultivate a primordial body cultivator, he’d be a rare genius!</p><p>Experts spoke one after another, shocked by Bao de’s strength.</p><p>Tianming’s face was a little serious, but it was just a little serious.</p><p>“Great fate technique!”</p><p>He spoke softly, and the light on his body became even more dazzling.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He waved his hand, and a divine light slashed toward Bao de.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Bao de kept swinging his fists and bombarding the divine light. However, the divine light was firm and indestructible.</p><p>With every punch, Bao de’s figure was pushed back a bit. After dozens of punches, Bao de had already retreated dozens of miles, out of the fighting stage.</p><p>At this time, that divine light automatically dissipated.</p><p>“Damn it, I haven’t fought enough. Let’s fight again!”</p><p>Bao de roared like a mad beast. Then, his body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Tianming’s face became calm again, and he turned around to leave.</p><p>“Such powerful strength, it’s hard to estimate!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and looked at destiny, the child of destiny.</p><p>Tianming gave people the feeling that he was unfathomable. Although Bao de had forced a part of Tianming’s strength out, no one knew whether this was Tianming’s final strength or whether he was still hiding his strength.</p><p>Not only Lu Ming, but the other paragons such as Yuan Xin, ao ke, Yun Haoge, and the others also had grave expressions on their faces.</p><p>Tianming’s strength gave them a lot of pressure.</p><p>1 really want to fight you. I will prove to everyone who is the number one in the world!</p><p>Yuan Xin murmured, her battle intent exuberant.</p><p>“What a freak! How can we fight him?”</p><p>Wu Liang’s face was bitter.</p><p>alright, the first round of the competition is over. Lu Ming, bubbles, Wu Liang, Yuan Xin, and Tian Ming are the victors. They each have one point!</p><p>next, we will proceed to the second round. Lu Ming versus bubbles!</p><p>The old man announced.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles were stunned. They met each other so quickly. Did the old man do it on purpose?</p><p>I admit defeat. 1 don’t want to fight with brother Lu Ming. 1 admit defeat!</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s neck and refused to come down.</p><p>The people watching the battle were calm and not too surprised.</p><p>They had long known that it was impossible for Lu Ming and bubbles to fight. One of them would definitely admit defeat.</p><p>alright, Lu Ming wins this round. Next round, Yun Haoge versus Yuan Xin!</p><p>The white-haired old man announced once more.</p><p>Yun Haoge versus Yuan Xin.</p><p>This was also a battle of the peak, and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>However, in the end, Yuan Xin used two types of nomological laws and fused them together, defeating Yun Haoge in one fell swoop.</p><p>This shocked everyone, and they had to re-evaluate Yuan Xin’s combat strength.</p><p>Yuan Xin had actually comprehended a second type of law, and it was a King path law at that. The fusion of the two had greatly increased his strength.</p><p>This made people marvel at Yuan Xin’s talent. He had only become a divine Emperor not long ago, but he had already comprehended a second type of nomological law, and his level of mastery was not low.</p><p>In the third match of the second round, creak was up against the Galaxy.</p><p>This was a battle without any suspense. The Galaxy was crushed and lost two rounds in a row.</p><p>The fourth match, ancient devil versus Bao de.</p><p>The two of them both cultivated the ancient cultivation system. Unfortunately, ancient Devil’s cultivation was slightly weaker. He was no match for Bao de and was easily defeated.</p><p>The fifth match, Tianming versus the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk admitted defeat without even going up the stage.</p><p>In his words, he knew that he couldn’t win, but he still fought. Was he stupid?</p><p>The second round of the competition had ended. The only ones who still maintained their winning streak were Lu Ming, Tian Ming, and Yuan Xin.</p><p>After ten matches, the crowd had already begun to predict the rankings of the ten people.</p><p>without a doubt, Tianming is the strongest. He will be the champion this time! it’s hard to say. Yuan Xin isn’t weak either. What he’s showing now might not be his full strength. He might be able to fight against Tianming!</p><p>judging from the current situation, the top two should be Tianming and yuanxin. It’s very likely that Bao de will be in third place, but it’s not certain!</p><p>“All in all, the top five should be Tianming, yuanxin, Bao de, Wu Liang, and ao ke!”</p><p>Everyone made their own judgments and conjectures, but most of them believed that it should not be a problem for Tianming, Yuan Xin, Bao de, Wu Liang, and ao ke to get into the top five.</p><p>as for Lu Ming, he’s not weak either. He has mastered two ultimate maxims!</p><p>he’s not weak. There’s no problem for him to overpower the Galaxy and ancient demons. However, compared to Yun Haoge and bubbles, he’s probably not as strong. 1 estimate that Lu Ming’s final ranking should be seventh!</p><p>“This speculation is reasonable!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
