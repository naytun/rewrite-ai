Similarly, a powerful force could not do without the ancient scripture.</p><p>With the ancient scripture, the Martial Emperor realm experts could continue to advance. Otherwise, they would have no direction and would have to rely on themselves to figure things out. That would be much more difficult.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming was like this now!</p><p>He could now comprehend any new nomological law as he wished. If he had an ancient scripture, he could follow the records in the ancient scripture and deduce it. That way, his cultivation speed would naturally be much faster.</p><p>it’s a pity that the primal Chaos Scripture is incomplete. Moreover, I can’t go to the primal Chaos Palace now!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>Back then, Earth One had told him that as long as he defeated the son of chaos, he would be able to head to the primal Chaos Hall and completely inherit it.</p><p>He had defeated Yuan Xin a long time ago. However, back in the primordial realm, Lu Ming had tried to use the primordial chaos token to enter the chaos Hall many times, but there was no reaction at all.</p><p>If he had the chaos Scripture, he wouldn’t have to figure it out on his own.</p><p>“Dandan, you’ve reached the true Emperor level?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Dandan’s performance was extremely ferocious. Even a true Emperor realm evil god tribe member had been killed by dandan. Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>no, he’s only a peak void Emperor. However, killing a few low-level true emperors is a piece of cake!</p><p>Dandan was pleased with herself. She glanced at Lu Ming from the corner of her eyes and said, kid, don’t think that you’re amazing just because you’ve comprehended seven types of nomological laws. I’ll let you take a look at mine!</p><p>After saying that, dandan waved her hand. In the void, the power of laws gathered madly, filling the air with a brilliant light.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>There were nine types!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded!</p><p>Dandan controlled a total of nine types of laws. Among them, Lu Ming even saw an ultimate law, which was the primordial chaos law. The other eight were all King Dao laws.</p><p>Array Dao, alchemy Dao, weapon Dao, unperishable flame, destructive lightning…</p><p>Furthermore, some of the laws were extremely powerful. At least five of them had already reached the second realm.</p><p>No wonder dandan’s combat strength was so powerful that she could kill a true Emperor when she was only a peak void Emperor.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s dumbfounded expression, dandan’s vanity was extremely satisfied. She laughed strangely and said,”Kid, do you see? I’m unparalleled in the world. I’ve already mastered nine types of nomological laws, and I still have six types of nomological laws that have reached the second realm. Let alone the two-star true Emperor just now, I can even kill a three-star illusionary Emperor!”</p><p>Dandan was very proud, with her hands behind her back, looking unparalleled.</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. At the same time, he felt relieved.</p><p>Dandan hadn’t died at all back then. It was just that he had been severely injured, so he had turned into an egg and was finally reborn. Now that he had recovered all his memories, his cultivation speed was naturally amazing, and no one could compare to it.</p><p>Unlike bubbles, bubbles was a brand new life. One had to comprehend it step by step.</p><p>After being smug for a while, dandan placed her hands behind her back and sized Lu Ming up. kid, since you’ve comprehended the Dao of crafts, the Dao of arrays, and the Dao of alchemy, I can teach you a magical technique. It won’t improve your combat strength much, but it’ll greatly improve your ability to escape!</p><p>“Oh? What kind of divine ability?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>Dandan used to be by his side and was ‘suppressed’ miserably by him. She had not been able to make a name for herself. Now that her cultivation had finally surpassed Lu Ming and her memory had been restored, she naturally wanted to show off in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming would cooperate with him and let him show off more. When he was comfortable with it, Lu Ming could also gain some benefits.</p><p>Sure enough, dandan felt extremely comfortable, and her vanity was greatly satisfied.</p><p>He took out a jade talisman and started to inscribe on it. Then, he threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He discovered that it was a kind of Divine Art.</p><p>The six-feathered divine wings was a type of divine ability.</p><p>This divine power Technique was made up of six types of nomological laws. Only by mastering these six types of nomological laws could one cultivate this divine power Technique to the highest realm.</p><p>Of course, three of them could also be cultivated, but their power was relatively weaker.</p><p>These three were array Dao laws, smithing Dao laws, and alchemy Dao laws, what a wondrous magical power. Unfortunately, it’s not an ancient scripture. It’s just a simple magical power and can’t be used to deduce other laws!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“We’ll leave this place first. You can slowly comprehend it on the way!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the two of them left the place.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming diverted a portion of his attention to travel, while most of his attention was on comprehending the six-feathered divine wings.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming had gained some enlightenment. With a single thought, the three laws of array Dao, smithing Dao, and alchemy Dao filled the air. A pair of transparent wings appeared behind him. With a flap of the wings, Lu Ming’s speed increased exponentially. He flashed in the void non-stop as fast as lightning, and it was difficult to track his trajectory.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. Casting this kind of divine power Technique increased his speed by a few times.</p><p>He had only cultivated with three types of nomological laws. If he could control all six types of nomological laws, he didn’t know how astonishing his speed would be.</p><p>I’ve just finished refining it. As 1 cultivate in the future, my speed will be even faster. Furthermore, the laws of craftsmanship and alchemy haven’t reached perfection yet. If they were perfected, my speed would also increase!</p><p>also, the other three laws required to cultivate the six-feathered divine wings are all King path laws. One of them is the penetration law. Should I cultivate this law after this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking in his mind.</p><p>In the end, he decided to take it slow, because the laws of alchemy and the laws of craftsmanship had not reached perfection yet. He planned to cultivate these two laws to perfection first before considering other laws.</p><p>But even so, his speed had increased greatly, and his ability to survive had greatly improved.</p><p>Very quickly, a few days had passed. Lu Ming’s control of the six divine wings had become more and more proficient.</p><p>In the past few days, they had also made some gains. They had obtained a total of two pieces of the realm core. Although the energy loss was severe, some of it was still preserved. For a Martial Emperor, it was definitely a treasure that could help them improve their cultivation.</p><p>It was rare for dandan to be so kind this time. She gave a piece to Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming kept it without any hesitation. If he became an Emperor in the future, this thing would be of great use.</p><p>“Wait, there’s someone!”</p><p>Suddenly, dandan said in a low voice, and then her aura was restrained to the extreme.</p><p>Dandan had also mastered a technique to conceal her aura and change her appearance, which was no weaker than the divine breath technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He activated the divine breath technique and the two of them hid under a rock.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a streak of light flew by at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“What a strong cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The beam of light swept past, but Lu Ming could still see it. It was an evil god tribe member. He was extremely powerful and definitely not an ordinary true Emperor.</p><p>a peak true Emperor actually dares to fly at such a fast speed. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>She muttered to Lu Ming via voice transmission.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, a battle cry rang out, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Following that, a terrified roar sounded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
