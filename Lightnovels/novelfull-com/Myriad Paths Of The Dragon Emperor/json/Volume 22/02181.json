You can actually kill a one-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Sakra said coldly.</p><p>However, he was still confident and not worried.</p><p>He was a three-star void Emperor!</p><p>The difference between a one-star void Emperor and a three-star void Emperor was too great. He could easily kill a one-star void Emperor in seconds.</p><p>He did not think that Lu Ming could fight him!</p><p>Moreover, he could tell that Lu Ming had not broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>No matter how strong the Emperor-to-be was? How could he be a match for a three-star void Emperor?</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll end you personally!”</p><p>Sakra Azia’s body exuded a cold killing intent, and his aura was monstrous.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming made his move directly. He was too lazy to talk nonsense with sakra and directly attacked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the process of rushing out, the aura on Lu Ming’s body kept exploding and rising. One law after another burst out.</p><p>Five types of nomological laws erupted one after another, forming a five-colored river of nomological laws.</p><p>“This is … The law of chaos and the law of death. How is this possible? impossible! This is impossible …”</p><p>In an instant, sakra Azia’s expression changed drastically as he roared madly, as if he had discovered something unbelievable and unbelievable.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm. The sky and earth rumbled and the space was penetrated.</p><p>“The Emperor sword!”</p><p>Sakra roared. At this moment, he was extremely frightened and exploded with all his strength, hoping to block it.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming released five types of laws, two ultimate laws and three king path laws. He was almost scared to death.</p><p>At this moment, the experts of the divine ox Palace and the barbaric Dragon Palace were almost scared to death as they roared madly.</p><p>The people from the divine wilderness continent did not know how shocking Lu Ming’s display of five types of laws was. However, they, who came from the yuan continent, naturally knew.</p><p>Their hearts were in a state of shock.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and sakra’s attacks collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm force bombarded the Emperor sword that sakra slashed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor sword trembled violently as if it could not bear the burden and finally exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm did not stop and continued to bombard forward, hitting sakra’s chest. Sakra’s chest was directly penetrated, leaving a hole in it. The terrifying power of destruction poured into sakra’s body crazily, destroying his life.</p><p>“You … You … How is that possible …”</p><p>Blood kept gushing out of sakra Azia’s mouth. He stared at Lu Ming with disbelief.</p><p>Even now, he still could not believe that a person could master five types of laws before breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm. Two of them were even ultimate laws.</p><p>This had simply broken his understanding of martial arts.</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying destructive power rushed into sakra Azia’s body. Sakra Azia’s body exploded and turned into ashes. Even his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept sakra’s storage ring.</p><p>At this moment, the scene was in a dead silence.</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded and their eyes widened.</p><p>In their eyes, the Supreme Yuan continent powerhouse, the unrivaled sakra Azia, could not even last one move in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>He was instantly killed in one move.</p><p>If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, it would seem like a fantasy story.</p><p>master is invincible! Master is invincible!</p><p>After a long while, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou finally reacted. They were so excited that they trembled and shouted.</p><p>“The Alliance master is invincible!”</p><p>Then, the members of the Dragon Alliance came back to their senses and started to shout in excitement.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was Supreme and invincible in their eyes.</p><p>The shouts came wave after wave, soaring into the clouds.</p><p>Hua Chi, Xue Lian, Xia Jiuyang, and the others were also trembling with excitement.</p><p>As for those from the sovereign race, divine ox Palace, and manlong Palace, their faces were deathly pale.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and the place quieted down.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Ren qianxing indifferently.</p><p>“Didn’t you just want to crush me with one finger? Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Ren qianxing’s body went limp as he collapsed onto the ground. His face was completely drained of blood, and he was so frightened that he almost cried. Was he courting death by attacking Lu Ming?</p><p>Even sakra Azia was no match for Lu Ming. He was simply an ant in front of Lu Ming. Lu Ming could probably kill him with a single breath.</p><p>such a person still wants to be on par with my master. He even brags that he has surpassed my master and is known as the number one in the divine wilderness. What a joke!</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou mocked.</p><p>Many people also sneered.</p><p>Indeed, Ren qianxing was not qualified to be compared to Lu Ming. They were on completely different levels.</p><p>This was especially so for those who had previously thought that Ren qianxing had already surpassed Lu Ming and regarded him as the number one throughout the ages. Their faces were flushed red and they were too ashamed to show their faces.</p><p>Ren qianxing was not even fit to carry Lu Ming’s shoes.</p><p>“Legend, he’s still a legend!”</p><p>An old man sighed.</p><p>Everyone immediately nodded, greatly moved.</p><p>Yes, a legend was still a legend.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming was a legend of the divine wilderness continent. He rose up from the ground and eventually unified the divine wilderness. He was an unprecedented legend in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Now, after cultivating in the yuan continent for more than ten years, his combat strength had reached an unimaginable realm. Even someone as powerful as sakra di was killed in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming was still a legend.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, the monarch race and the remaining evil god race members finally reacted. They all rushed up into the sky, wanting to escape.</p><p>“You want to leave? All of you, stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>This punch was filled with countless runes. Then, the runes condensed into true dragons that pounced out with a roar.</p><p>The sovereign race’s Martial Emperor powerhouse had already been killed by Lu Ming. Anyone below the Martial Emperor realm would not be able to withstand a single blow.</p><p>When the true dragon pounced, no matter if it was an Emperor-to-be or an absolute Saint, they were all killed in seconds.</p><p>A series of screams rang out, but it soon quieted down.</p><p>The experts of the sovereign race and evil god race were all killed.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>At this moment, Li Ke knelt down and screamed,” “Lu Ming, no, no, no, Alliance Master Lu, please spare my life! Please spare my dog life!”</p><p>Earlier on, his master was killed by Lu Ming. He was scared to death now.</p><p>“Alliance Master Lu, please spare me!”</p><p>Ren qianxing also started pleading.</p><p>“Fatty, Xiao Shan, Xiao Rou, I’ll leave these people to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The fat man carried the battle-axe and rushed out.</p><p>“No, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>Ren qianxing howled as he turned and ran.</p><p>Li Ke was the same.</p><p>However, their combat power was far from that of fatty and Zhuang Xiaoshan, so they were killed in a few moves..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
