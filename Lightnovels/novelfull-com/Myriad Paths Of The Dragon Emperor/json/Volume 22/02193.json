With a single thought, Lu Ming kept the power of his third bloodline.</p><p>“What exactly is this third bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think.</p><p>He had been thinking about this question more than once.</p><p>The third bloodline seemed to be very mysterious and had endless power and killing intent. He didn’t dare to borrow too much power from it.</p><p>This power was not something he could control.</p><p>Furthermore, as his cultivation level grew, his fear of the third bloodline grew even stronger.</p><p>This was because no matter how much he improved, he was still as insignificant as an ant in front of the power of the third bloodline.</p><p>1 don’t care. As long as I can keep getting stronger, I can use this power for myself!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He then put away all the storage bracelets of the evil god tribe, including those of the evil god tribe that had been killed by the large bow.</p><p>These were all Martial Emperor realm powerhouses. To Lu Ming, it was another great harvest.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming started to search through the storage rings one by one.</p><p>“I found it!”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming was overjoyed and a large bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>It was the huge bow that the evil god tribe had obtained previously.</p><p>The bow was one and a half meters long and made of an unknown material. It was extremely heavy and the surface of the bow was covered in rust.</p><p>“Try it!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the bow handle with one hand and pulled the bowstring with the other. He pulled with all his might!</p><p>It didn’t move at all!</p><p>The bow didn’t move at all, and the bowstring didn’t curve at all.</p><p>with my current strength, I can’t move it at all. No wonder those evil god tribe members can’t move it either!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>This bow was no small matter. It was definitely a Supreme treasure. Even after so many years, it still retained its spiritual nature.</p><p>“Let’s try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was unwilling to give up. This time, he unleashed all his power of law.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, the bow vibrated slightly. At the same time, Lu Ming felt the bowstring being pulled.</p><p>Although it was only pulled a little, it was indeed pulled.</p><p>At the same time, the energy of heaven and earth, as well as the Saint energy in Lu Ming’s body, gushed into the bow.</p><p>An arrow that glowed with seven colors appeared.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He released his grip and the arrow shot out like a bolt of lightning. It flew tens of thousands of meters away and landed on a mountain peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A large hole was blasted in the mountain peak, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of excitement.</p><p>This was an ancient battlefield. After the battle of peerless experts, energy and killing intent wreaked havoc, causing the ground and mountain rocks to become extremely hard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s all-out attack could only leave a shallow mark on the ground.</p><p>However, the arrow just now had created a huge hole in a mountain. The power of the arrow was extremely shocking.</p><p>however, the amount of Saint power I’m using up is also shocking. I can’t use it all the time!</p><p>This bow seemed to require many types of laws in order to draw it. The amount of holy power it consumed was also shocking. Lu Ming would not be able to use it many times before his holy power would be completely depleted.</p><p>“With such power, I’m afraid even a seven-star illusionary Emperor would be shot to death by this arrow!”</p><p>Although the Holy power consumption was shocking, Lu Ming was still very satisfied.</p><p>With this bow, he didn’t need to fear anyone below the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Moreover, he had only pulled the bowstring a little, and was far from displaying the bow’s power.</p><p>As his cultivation level increased, the power of this bow would also become stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the big bow excitedly. In a flash, he left the place.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to explore alone without any direction.</p><p>A day later, he had no idea how far he had walked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a roar ahead.</p><p>Someone was fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and hurried over quietly. He then saw that some members of the evil god tribe were besieging three humans.</p><p>A young man, a middle-aged man, and an old man.</p><p>The young man was slightly fat and had a very strong cultivation base. He had reached the three-star void Emperor realm and also mastered an ultimate law. He was obviously a top-tier heaven’s favorite.</p><p>The middle-aged burly man was a five-star void Emperor!</p><p>The old man was a six-star void Emperor, and his battle strength was very strong.</p><p>However, at this moment, they were in grave danger. A total of six members of the evil god race were attacking them.</p><p>These six members of the evil god race were covered in purple scales, and their cultivation bases were extremely profound.</p><p>One of them was also a six-star void Emperor, and his battle strength was not weaker than the old man’s.</p><p>There were also three five-star void emperors and two four-star void emperors.</p><p>Such a lineup had put the three humans in a dangerous situation. Even if they tried their best to defend, they wouldn’t be able to stop it.</p><p>young master, run! We’ll block them!</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>“If we’re leaving, we’ll leave together!”</p><p>The chubby young man roared.</p><p>you want to leave? none of you can. The reward for killing a human heaven’s favorite is quite a lot. Hehehe!</p><p>The six-star illusionary Emperor from the evil god tribe laughed out loud. However, his attacks did not weaken at all as he continued to attack the old man.</p><p>Not only did the old man have to defend against the attack of the six-star void Emperor, but he also had to defend against two five-star void emperors. He was in a very dangerous situation, and a trace of blood had already seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The evil god tribe cried out.</p><p>In the distance, a cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The large bow appeared in his hand, and he sneaked around to another direction.</p><p>He was going to make a move!</p><p>If the people fighting in front were from the heaven realm, he wouldn’t have interfered.</p><p>However, one side was the evil god tribe, and the other side was the human race. That was a different story.</p><p>Similarly, if Lu Ming had not obtained the big bow, he would not have interfered. The other party had a five-star and a six-star illusionary Emperor. With his current combat strength, he would only be courting death if he interfered.</p><p>However, with the bow in his hands, Lu Ming was not afraid.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming had circled to another direction. He pulled the bowstring and aimed it at the six-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>The longbow emitted a faint glow. The energy between heaven and earth and Lu Ming’s Saint energy continuously poured into the longbow. A seven-colored arrow appeared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming released his grip and the arrow flew out. In an instant, it crossed a distance of tens of miles and shot towards the six-star void Emperor at an astonishing speed.</p><p>That six-star xudu reacted and wanted to Dodge, but it was already too late.</p><p>He could only defend with all his might.</p><p>However, his defense was as fragile washi.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The arrow pierced through all of his defenses and shot into the space between his eyebrows. It carried him tens of thousands of meters away, and he stared at a low peak.</p><p>A six-star void Emperor was instantly killed.</p><p>At the scene, both the human race and the evil god race were stunned.</p><p>The evil god tribe, in particular, turned pale with fright.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>How could the old man miss this opportunity? he exploded with all his strength and slashed out a sword light, severely injuring a five-star illusionary Emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
