Furthermore, this generation was known as the golden age. Many paragons emerged, and strong cultivators gathered. Many sons of heaven were reduced to mere foils, attracting worldwide attention.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, stood on top of all the paragons and fought at the peak. He used his abilities to prove to everyone that he was the strongest.</p><p>he’s already so terrifying even before becoming a saint Emperor. His future is limitless!</p><p>with such heaven-defying talent, if he continues to grow, he’ll probably become the strongest person in the world!</p><p>Most of the people were discussing and discussing Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Yuan Xin and Tian Ming were ignored.</p><p>The son of destiny and the Son of chaos were originally brilliant and dazzling, attracting the attention of the world. But at this moment, all the brilliance was snatched away by a single person.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you’re really amazing!”</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s body, reluctant to come down.</p><p>“Master is so powerful!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli also came over and looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was invincible.</p><p>“Lu Ming, congratulations!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the rest also came over to congratulate Lu Ming.</p><p>To be honest, it was beyond their expectations that Lu Ming could defeat Tianming.</p><p>“Everyone, this matter isn’t over yet. Now, it’s time to give you your rewards!”</p><p>At this time, the white-haired old man’s voice rang out again, and the scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>That’s right, all those who had passed the selection before had been rewarded and could enter that corner of the world to obtain great opportunities. What about now? how could there be no reward?</p><p>At the very least, the rewards for the top ten would definitely be shocking.</p><p>Especially the first place!</p><p>Many people looked envious as they looked at the white-haired old man, trying to guess what the reward was.</p><p>However, there was no doubt that the rewards would definitely be more generous than the previous screening.</p><p>the reward this time is a little special. You’ll have to wait for a while. You’ll know when the time comes!</p><p>The white-haired elder came to an ancient altar on the peak of destiny mountain. He waved his hands and beams of light entered the altar. The altar glowed with a bright light. A beam of light broke through the void and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>Everyone was curious, but they didn’t ask much and waited patiently.</p><p>This wait lasted for two days.</p><p>On this day, deep in the sky, there was a dull roar, and then a bright golden light covered half of the sky.</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s a door!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, where the light was the brightest, a door suddenly appeared.</p><p>This wasn’t a door of light. It seemed to be made of solid bronze.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The door was open, and at this moment, roars could be heard from behind the door that shook the world.</p><p>Dragon’s Roar!</p><p>Many people could tell that this was the roar of a true dragon.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the sound of footsteps in the air coming from the gate, and the Dragon’s Roar was getting louder and louder.</p><p>Then, everyone saw nine true dragons rush out of the gate.</p><p>Nine true dragons lined up, pulling a huge chariot, and appeared in the depths of the sky.</p><p>On the chariot, there were many figures. Most of them were young people, looking to be in their twenties. There were men and women, and each of them had an extraordinary temperament.</p><p>There was a middle-aged man on the chariot. He was wearing iron armor and exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>It was the aura of a great emperor!</p><p>At the highest point of the chariot sat a figure. However, this figure was shrouded in divine light and his appearance could not be seen clearly.</p><p>Many people were shocked!</p><p>Who was this person? It had actually appeared from the depths of the sky, and it was being pulled by nine true dragons.</p><p>There were also true dragons in Yuan mountain. At this moment, many of them had ugly expressions.</p><p>It was an insult to the true dragon clan to have nine true dragons pulling a carriage.</p><p>However, the middle-aged man’s aura was too shocking. It was filled with killing intent and boundless killing intent. It was as if he was in hell. Even many emperors had serious expressions.</p><p>The true dragon stepped on the air and came to the sky above the Mountain of Destiny, floating there.</p><p>The white-haired elder and the other great emperors all came forward and cupped their fists. “Greetings, emissaries of the heaven realm!”</p><p>What? Heaven realm emissary?</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>They finally understood that these people were from the heaven realm.</p><p>Some great emperors might not be unfamiliar with the heaven realm, because they should have a way to enter the heaven realm.</p><p>But for those below the great emperor, the heaven realm was a legend.</p><p>Many powerful forces knew that there was a war in the heaven realm, but they had never been to the heaven realm.</p><p>It was even more so for the younger generation.</p><p>Now, they finally saw the people from the heaven realm. Many people’s eyes lit up as they sized up the people from the heaven realm.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He saw two young men on the heaven chariot. He had seen them before.</p><p>Previously, when he had entered the primordial realm, he had seen two youths in the corner of the world that he had left behind.</p><p>The other had purple hair and an extraordinary aura.</p><p>The other one was in a black robe and had mastered the law of Samsara. He was a Scion of Samsara and had fought with Lu Ming before.</p><p>“These two people are indeed from the heaven realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. At this moment, he thought of many things.</p><p>It seemed that not only the prides of the primordial realm had entered that corner of the world, but the prides of the heaven realm had also entered.</p><p>“Could it be that the so-called opportunity is related to the heaven realm?”</p><p>the heaven realm has been passed down for countless years. It’s much older than the primordial realm. Legend has it that it has endless opportunities!</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>Although many people knew that most of the nine Heavens domain in the heaven realm had been occupied by the alien races, there was still the strongest and largest domain in the heaven realm, the Tai Qing heaven domain, which was still under their control.</p><p>It was said that the area of the Tai Qing heavenly region was not smaller than the yuan continent. It also contained all kinds of opportunities that the heaven realm had obtained over countless years.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>who are the top ten prodigies of the primordial realm? come out and take a look!</p><p>The middle-aged man in iron armor stepped out and his voice spread through the entire area.</p><p>Many people retreated. Lu Ming and the rest of the top ten stepped out and appeared in the middle of the destiny mountain.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes were like lightning as he swept his gaze over the ten people.</p><p>Goosebumps rose all over Lu Ming’s body. It was as if the armored man’s gaze could see through them.</p><p>The armored man glanced around and nodded, satisfied, that’s right. It’s said that the primordial realm is also full of prodigies, and they didn’t disappoint me. This time, many of you can enter the heaven realm and obtain great opportunities!</p><p>The armored man said. Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The reward this time was related to the heaven realm.</p><p>general, I heard that the primordial realm has also reached its golden age, and the elites have gathered. The ten strongest elites have been decided, and I’m itching to spar with them. I hope you’ll grant my wish!</p><p>At this time, in the heaven realm, a burly young man stepped out and cupped his fists to the armored man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
