Volcanoes exploded one after another, and lava wreaked havoc.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The cries of pain continued to ring out as the Golden crows were swept by the sword Qi and exploded one after another, their golden feathers flying in the air. “Who is it? You want to kill my golden Crow race I”</p><p>“Let’s escape first!”</p><p>The Golden Crow clan was in complete chaos. One by one, the golden three-legged golden crows shot up into the sky, trying to escape.</p><p>However, in the sky, a figure holding a stone sword stepped through the air. Sword light burst forth, killing one golden Crow after another and falling down.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>A loud roar reverberated in all directions.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, why do you want to kill the Golden Crow clan?!”</p><p>Upon hearing that it was Lu Ming, many golden crows panicked and roared.</p><p>“The Golden Crow Tribe shall be exterminated! ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The stone sword did not stop. With every slash, a golden Crow was killed.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had specifically picked the powerful golden Crow race to kill.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, even a true Emperor could not fight back and was killed with one sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on a golden Crow. This golden Crow had an extremely powerful aura. It was a high-level true Emperor and was very likely a high-ranking member of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>The Golden Crow race’s tribe leader roared. He was truly panicking.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be able to control the celestial Thearch’s physical body. With the celestial Thearch’s sword in hand, he was astonishingly powerful. Even someone as powerful as him felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p>lie could only escape and wait for Emperor tianluo and the MU family experts to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in the next moment, he was in despair. A sword light broke through the void and approached him in an instant.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Golden Crow race’s chief cried out in fear. His entire body was covered in golden flames as if he had turned into a huge sun. He wanted to block Lu Ming’s sword gleam.</p><p>but as the sword light passed, the flame was extinguished. A sword mark appeared on the Golden Crow race chief’s forehead. His soul had been destroyed.</p><p>The chief of the Golden Crow race had fallen!</p><p>This time, the energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s physical body had reached thirty-six percent. Even if Lu Ming controlled the celestial Thearch sword alone, no one below the great emperor realm could block it.</p><p>“The chief is dead!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The Golden crows roared loudly. It was a mess, a complete mess!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to kill as he continuously slashed out sword beams, specifically targeting the true Emperor and empty Emperor realm golden crows.</p><p>The sword light was so fast that it pierced through the void. Even with the Golden crow’s extreme speed, it was difficult to escape.</p><p>One golden Crow after another fell to the ground and died!</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after a long while.</p><p>Almost all the martial sovereigns of the Golden Crow clan had been slaughtered, and only a few of those below the rank of martial sovereign had managed to escape.</p><p>After this battle, the Golden Crow clan could be considered to have declined.</p><p>Lu Ming s figure flashed and he started to collect his spoils of war.</p><p>He put all the dead bodies of the Golden crows into a storage ring.</p><p>After cleaning up, Lu Ming turned and left.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming left, many figures flashed over.</p><p>it was people from the other forces of ancient Moon Holy Land.
