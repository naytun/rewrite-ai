He had not disguised himself.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The scene exploded. It was a complete mess.</p><p>A single person could actually control two ultimate maxims at the same time, and they were below the rank of a martial Supreme. In addition to the array Dao law from before, Lu Ming had mastered three types of ultimate maxims.</p><p>The pot exploded, it completely exploded.</p><p>This was unprecedented.</p><p>Oh my God, this is heaven-defying! Lu Ming is going to defy heaven!</p><p>“How is it possible for a person to control two ultimate maxims at the same time? Even a Martial Emperor can’t do it!”</p><p>the strongest can not be tolerated. This has been a truth since ancient times. Now, the truth has been broken!</p><p>There was a clamor. Many people were shouting. Even many of the older generation were like this. The main reason was that the impact was too great.</p><p>It was as if the truth that he had always believed in had collapsed in an instant, and he could not calm down.</p><p>Even the Emperor could not remain calm. He looked at Lu Ming as if he was a monster.</p><p>how is this possible? how is this possible? ”</p><p>The forces that had a grudge against Lu Ming, such as the Heng family, were all in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Xin, Destiny’s Child, and the other top geniuses could no longer remain calm. A terrifying aura erupted from their bodies.</p><p>invincible! Brother Lu Ming is invincible!</p><p>Bubbles shouted.</p><p>“Master is invincible!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli also joined in.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. He knew that once he revealed his true identity, it would definitely cause an uproar and shock the world.</p><p>However, he still didn’t hide it.</p><p>That was because if he were to face Yuan Xin, Destiny’s Child, and the others later on, he would definitely not be able to hide it and would have to reveal his full strength.</p><p>Whether he was exposed earlier or later, he would still be exposed.</p><p>In addition, the energy in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had already been stored up to thirty-six percent. He had more confidence now, and there were fewer concerns.</p><p>If the MU family wanted to attack him, Xiangxiang, Qiuyue, and the others after the battle of the ten lands ended, he would just take them and run.</p><p>In any case, the defensive power of Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was astonishing, not to mention that there were also Emperor Wu Xiang, uncle Kong, and the others.</p><p>At this moment, uncle Kong, Emperor formless, and the others couldn’t remain calm. They were all stroking their beards with all their might.</p><p>They had lived for countless years, but this was the first time they had seen such a thing.</p><p>“Ah, ah, let me go!”</p><p>At this moment, Mu yang was almost scared to death as he screamed madly.</p><p>A person could actually control two ultimate maxims. No wonder his combat strength was so terrifying. He was about to be scared to death.</p><p>“Muyang, you were the one who asked the death god nation to assassinate me, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please spare me …”</p><p>Mu yang screamed in fear.</p><p>Many people’s hearts skipped a beat. It seemed that it was really Muyang’s doing. He had asked the people of the death god nation to assassinate Lu Ming. They did not know what method Lu Ming had used, but he had actually avoided death and even made the people of the death god nation think that they had killed Lu Ming.</p><p>despicable! You can’t defeat my master, but you secretly ordered an assassin to kill my master. You deserve to die!</p><p>“Master, kill him!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were filled with righteous indignation. They wanted to kill Mu yang personally.</p><p>“Muyang, have a safe journey!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, under Muyang’s frightened gaze, he squeezed hard. The terrifying power directly crushed Muyang’s soul, causing it to scatter.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Emperor from the MU family roared, his eyes extremely sinister.</p><p>A God’s Son was killed just like that. Their hearts were bleeding.</p><p>The king body was said to have the potential of a great emperor, and the Son of God was undoubtedly even stronger. He had a very high chance of breaking through to the great emperor realm, and he could even take a step closer to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Any force would treat such a prodigy as a treasure. However, he was killed by Lu Ming in front of everyone. His soul had been scattered.</p><p>After killing Mu yang, the stone platform that represented him turned into a puff of smoke and dissipated. Lu Ming returned to the stone platform and floated back.</p><p>Many pairs of eyes fell on Lu Ming. Some of them were filled with solemness, while others were filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Previously, everyone did not take Lu Ming seriously. No matter how strong an Emperor-to-be was, he would not pose a threat to them.</p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed Muyang and, for the first time, mastered two ultimate maxims.</p><p>The most important thing was that Lu Ming did not use the chaos law when he killed Mu yang.</p><p>If he used the chaos law and the death law, how powerful would it be when the two were combined?</p><p>Everyone re-evaluated Lu Ming’s combat ability.</p><p>Of course, some people were not optimistic about Lu Ming’s chances. They thought that it was already unprecedented for him to control two ultimate maxims at the same time. It was impossible to merge the two ultimate maxims and increase the power.</p><p>Many people agreed with this view.</p><p>The competition continued as everyone struggled to calm down.</p><p>After the battle between Lu Ming and Mu yang, there were only about twenty people left. It could be said that those who remained were the strongest of the strong. Every battle attracted the attention of the crowd.</p><p>Destiny’s Child, Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, and the others still managed to defeat their opponents.</p><p>The death blade had finally come to an end.</p><p>He had encountered the true dragon, which seemed to have cultivated the primordial demonic Dao. It was extremely powerful. Although the death blade had tried his best, he was still no match for it and was defeated after dozens of moves.</p><p>In the star River, he had also encountered a powerful opponent. However, he was indeed very strong himself. He fought with his opponent for over a hundred moves and won by a narrow margin.</p><p>Bubbles had also defeated his opponent.</p><p>When it was Lu Ming’s turn again, his opponent was not strong. He was slightly weaker than Muyang and was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Slowly, there were only thirteen people left.</p><p>The thirteen stone platforms floated in the air and sized each other up.</p><p>It could be said that each of these 13 people was extremely powerful.</p><p>Among them, the son of fate, Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, the true dragon who cultivated the immemorial demonic Dao, the immemorial body cultivator, and the Son of spacetime were the most popular.</p><p>This was because these people had already reached the Martial Emperor realm two years ago.</p><p>Two years later, he would undoubtedly be even more powerful and his strength would be unfathomable.</p><p>However, these people had yet to meet each other.</p><p>“Could it be related to the stone platform?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. Perhaps the stone platform could roughly distinguish the strength of the people. Hence, some of the strongest people would automatically avoid them.</p><p>This was very possible. If the strongest people had encountered it earlier, it would have been a little unfair.</p><p>The stone platform spun, and then, two stone platforms flew out and collided with each other.</p><p>One of them was Destiny’s Child.</p><p>The person who had collided with Destiny’s Child had an extremely ugly expression.</p><p>He had actually encountered the son of fate.</p><p>The name of the child of destiny was Tianming. It was named after the City of Destiny, which showed that his heart was higher than the sky.</p><p>And he was worthy of this name.</p><p>Tianming was dressed in white, his long hair reaching his waist. He was extremely handsome, just like the legendary Son of God.</p><p>He had a smile on his face the entire time. He stood there, but the surface of his body seemed to be shrouded in a layer of hazy radiance, making him look as if he was not in this world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
