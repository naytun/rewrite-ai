They were all unfathomable.</p><p>However, most people still thought that Tianming should have no problem winning.</p><p>Destiny’s Child was someone who could control one’s fate. In the course of countless years, there had only been a few of them. Every single one of them stood at the peak and became an expert.</p><p>“Do you want to admit defeat?”</p><p>Tianming asked his opponent with a calm and peaceful smile.</p><p>“Of the top ten laws, the fate law faintly suppresses the other laws. I’d like to experience it!”</p><p>Said the young man. He was also a very powerful Son of Heaven. Two years ago, he was about to become an Emperor. After two years of cultivation, his cultivation had reached the peak of one-star void Emperor. How could he surrender without a fight?</p><p>no! Tianming shook his head and said,” from the moment you said that, your fate has already been decided. You are going to lose!</p><p>what Bullsh * t fate? my fate is up to me, not the heavens. No one can control my fate!</p><p>The young man shouted and charged toward Tianming.</p><p>“You are destined to be struck by lightning!”</p><p>Tianming said, still smiling.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, endless lightning appeared out of thin air and struck towards the other party.</p><p>Each bolt of lightning was colorful. There were five colors and they were as thick as an arm. Their power was shocking.</p><p>The densely packed lightning directly drowned the young man.</p><p>The young man let out a long roar and madly used his divine abilities to resist the lightning.</p><p>“Your fate is to be burned!”</p><p>Tianming spoke again.</p><p>Then, endless flames appeared. They were all extremely terrifying flames and drowned the young man.</p><p>“Your fate is to be cut by a blade!”</p><p>“Your fate is to be hammered!”</p><p>Tianming continued to speak, and every word he said came true. All kinds of attacks were launched at his opponent.</p><p>The young man finally could not hold on any longer. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and was sent flying out of the battle stage.</p><p>As for Tianming, from the beginning to the end, he had a smile on his face. He stood on the stone platform in white and did not move a single step. He was extraordinary.</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>The law of fate was too terrifying. Could it really determine a person’s fate?</p><p>If he said that the other party would be struck by lightning, then he would be struck by lightning. If he wanted to be cut by a blade, then he would be cut by a blade.</p><p>It was as if he was in control of the fate of others.</p><p>Even Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>Tianming’s stone platform flew back, and there were still twelve people on the scene.</p><p>As long as another 20% of the competition went on, the top ten would be decided.</p><p>Soon, two more stone platforms flew out and collided with each other.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled again.</p><p>This time, the one who took the stage was Yuan Xin.</p><p>His opponent’s face also darkened.</p><p>In the eyes of others, Yuan Xin was a person who could contend with the heavenly mandate realm. It could only be considered bad luck to encounter him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin attacked directly in a domineering manner.</p><p>His Chaos Divine fist was unparalleled in attack power, crushing his opponent as soon as he made his move.</p><p>Although his opponent was strong, he was still at a disadvantage. He was completely outmatched.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s cultivation is definitely not at the level of a one-star void Emperor. I’m afraid she’s already at the level of a two-star void Emperor!</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>Many people nodded their heads. This was very normal. Two years ago, Yuan Xin had already become a saint Emperor. In the past two years, she had encountered many opportunities. How could she not have improved?</p><p>Not long after, Yuan Xin’s opponent was defeated, coughing up blood and retreating from the fighting ring.</p><p>After Yuan Xin returned, there were still 11 people left.</p><p>Then, two more stone platforms collided with each other.</p><p>“It’s him, an immemorial body cultivator!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with interest.</p><p>One of them was the immemorial body cultivator called Bao de.</p><p>This person was almost three meters tall. He was bald and his entire body was pitch black. He was like a piece of black charcoal, but also like a piece of black steel, as if he was filled with endless power.</p><p>The immemorial body cultivators specialized in cultivating the physical body. They had unparalleled physiques and boundless strength. Their strength could break ten thousand techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming was very interested. His rousen had been tempered five times in a row and contained three wisps of chaos Qi. It was already very powerful.</p><p>But compared to Bao de, there was still a big gap.</p><p>Bao de’s opponent’s expression was also very ugly.</p><p>This was because Bao de was also considered one of the strongest.</p><p>Why did the last three people only encounter the strongest few?</p><p>“Haha, little guy, make your move!”</p><p>Bao de grinned and walked towards the other party like a giant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Bao de attacked. It was simple and direct. He directly punched out.</p><p>This punch directly pierced through the space. His pitch-black fist was like an ancient divine mountain that pressed down on the other party.</p><p>The other party wasn’t weak either. It could be said that he was very strong. He erupted with all his strength and resisted Bao de.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was still no match for Bao de.</p><p>Bao de’s fist landed and directly pierced through the ultimate Maxim. His opponent’s expression changed drastically as he rapidly retreated. He was almost sent flying off the stone platform by Bao de.</p><p>“Little guy, you can’t do it, hahaha!”</p><p>Bao de laughed loudly. His three-meter-tall body directly charged towards the other party at an astonishing speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other party used all his strength to blast out a Divine Art, but it was useless when it landed on Bao de’s body. It didn’t break Bao de’s defense.</p><p>Bao de’s body was like a divine weapon. He broke through the opponent’s attack and then ruthlessly hit the opponent’s body.</p><p>The other party grunted, and a crackling sound came from his body. Then, he spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body flew out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Many people sucked in a breath of cold air. This Bao de was truly terrifying. His strength was boundless, and he had defeated his opponent in just a few moves, what terrifying strength! It’s pure physical strength!</p><p>In the crowd, desolate li and Long Chen’s expressions were extremely serious.</p><p>They cultivated the law of extremity and were known as the ultimate power, but compared to Bao de, they were far from it.</p><p>Bao de defeated his opponent, and there were only ten people left.</p><p>The top ten had been born.</p><p>They were Tianming, Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, Bao de, the true dragon Pinker, the son of time and space Yun Haoge, bubbles, Heng Xinghe, the ancient devil, and Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the ten people.</p><p>All of Mount Yuan was filled with countless chosen, including the ten most powerful chosen, who were the focus of attention.</p><p>alright, now that the top ten have been born, I’ll give you three days to rest.</p><p>Three days later, the final battle will begin!</p><p>The white-haired old man stepped out and announced.</p><p>“Master is too powerful!”</p><p>“And bubbles!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli and the rest cheered in excitement.</p><p>However, most people’s expressions were ugly. The geniuses they had high hopes for had all failed and failed to enter the top ten.</p><p>“Senior, I’m not convinced!”</p><p>At this time, a voice rang out, making everyone quiet down.</p><p>A young man stepped forward and cupped his fists at the white-haired old man.</p><p>“I’m not convinced either!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>A few young men walked out and clasped their hands at the white-haired old man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
