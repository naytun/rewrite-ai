They continued to wander around, relaxing and cultivating at the same time.</p><p>Aeon city, Mu family, a group of people were discussing something in a Hall.</p><p>“According to a reliable source, Lu Ming did not return to Mount Yuan. The only one who returned was that old bastard dan Kong!”</p><p>An expert of the MU clan said.</p><p>however, we have sent people to look for Lu Ming everywhere but we can’t find him. It seems that he has vanished into thin air!</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>“It’s fine. We’ll just wait for him. Lu Ming will return to Mount Yuan sooner or later. We’ll send people to Mount Yuan and wait for him there!”</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming must die. We must avenge Muyang!”</p><p>The experts of the MU clan all spoke.</p><p>“Let me go personally!”</p><p>Finally, a middle-aged man with a goatee walked out.</p><p>This was a great emperor. He was the first one to launch an attack on Lu Ming at the Mountain of Destiny.</p><p>“With you around, we can rest assured!”</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>The goateed Emperor immediately left Aeon city with the two masters of the MU family and headed for Yuan mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming was unaware of all this. They continued to walk and comprehend.</p><p>In the North of the yuan continent, the land of the divine beasts was an extremely desolate and hidden place. The space here was extremely unstable and the original Qi was thin. It was the famous Dead land of the land of the divine beasts.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of divine beasts in the land of divine beasts, but none of them would approach this place.</p><p>On this day, a beautiful Woman in Black was holding the hand of a little boy who was about three or four years old.</p><p>The little boy had bright eyes and white teeth. He was very good-looking.</p><p>“Mother, where are we going?”</p><p>The little boy asked.</p><p>The peerless woman looked at the little boy with a complicated look in her eyes. In the end, she said gently,” “Mother will take you to a better place to teach you cultivation!”</p><p>hehehe, little sister, I haven’t seen you for many years. I didn’t expect that you would even have a child!</p><p>A delicate laugh rang out, and a figure stepped through the air.</p><p>This was also a woman with unparalleled beauty. Her appearance was exactly the same as The Woman in Black from before, but her temperament was slightly different.</p><p>The woman behind him was wearing a white dress. She was covered in holy light and looked very Holy.</p><p>“Thank you, nianjun!”</p><p>The Woman in Black’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>That’s right, The Woman in Black was Xie nianqing, and The Woman in White was Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun looked at the little boy in Xie nianqing’s hands and was surprised, this little doll looks 70 – 80% similar to Lu Ming. Don’t tell me it’s yours and Lu Ming’s? this is really beyond my expectations.</p><p>I can see that you’ve already awakened. It’s even weirder that you’d do such a thing with Lu Ming and not kill him!</p><p>Xie nianjun was very curious.</p><p>“I don’t need you to care about me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>“That’s not right, I can see that your memories from your previous life and current life aren’t fusing. It should mean that your memories from this life aren’t willing to fuse with your memories from your previous life. No wonder, no wonder. However, if you continue like this, your cultivation level will be completely surpassed by me sooner or later!”</p><p>Xie nianjun chuckled as if he had noticed something.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression was complicated.</p><p>Although she had already awakened the memories of her previous life, she was unwilling to merge the memories of this life with those of her previous life. The two types of memories would alternate and control this body.</p><p>“Why do you have to do this? Only when we merge the memories of our past lives can we break through and rise again, surpass our past lives, and step onto the path of supremacy. If you do this, all your efforts will eventually go to waste!”</p><p>In the end, Xie nianjun sighed. Her personality had changed a lot compared to before.</p><p>In the past, she would never speak to Xie nianqing with such an attitude.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing’s expression changed. His eyes and expression changed. They were the same as before.</p><p>She patted the little boy’s head lovingly and said,” I won’t merge them. This life is this life, and the past life is the past life. Why should I awaken and merge them?”</p><p>“It seems that you can’t let go of Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>Xie nianqing remained silent.</p><p>mother, who is she? why does she look like you? ”</p><p>The little boy asked as he sized up Xie nianjun curiously.</p><p>“I’m your aunt. Come, come to me. I’ll take you to the heaven realm and teach you how to cultivate Supreme techniques!”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“I’ll take him there, you don’t need to worry!”</p><p>After Xie nianqing said that, he held the little boy’s hand and walked towards the void turbulence.</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled and followed them into the void. Finally, they disappeared.</p><p>If other people knew about this, they would be very surprised. The void turbulence here could actually lead to the heaven realm?</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue walked and stopped along the way. When they arrived at the ring sea, half a year had passed since the battle of the ten lands had ended.</p><p>In the past six months, the news of the battle of the ten lands had spread all over the world.</p><p>Countless people were shocked. Countless people knew of Lu Ming’s name. Of course, there were also countless people who sighed.</p><p>An unparalleled heaven’s favorite couldn’t become a saint Emperor. This made people sigh.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Qiu Yue arrived at the ring sea, they took the cross-sea warship and returned to the yuan mountain.</p><p>After returning to Mount Yuan, they didn’t disguise themselves and restored their original appearances.</p><p>Lu Ming did not head to the heavenly Emperor City, nor did he return to the ancient Moon sanctuary. The first place he wanted to go to was the ancient Saint clan.</p><p>He was going to the ancient Saint clan to find Xie nianjun and ask about Xie nianqing.</p><p>He felt that Xie nianjun must know what had happened to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Unfortunately, when he arrived at the ancient Saint clan, he was told that Xie nianjun had left the ancient Saint clan a few months ago and had disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to leave the ancient Saint clan and take the teleportation array back to the ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>Emperor notionless had already left. There was no need for Lu Ming to go to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to return to the ancient Moon Holy Land first before returning to the Azure continent.</p><p>It was time to settle the matter at the Azure continent.</p><p>With his current combat strength, he could kill an ordinary void Emperor with a wave of his hand.</p><p>After settling the matters at the Azure continent, it was time for him to return to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>It had been more than ten years since he left the divine wilderness continent. It was time for him to return.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is back!”</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out of the teleportation array outside the ancient Moon sanctuary, he was immediately recognized by the others.</p><p>The area around the teleportation formation was in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name shook the world.</p><p>In the battle of the ten lands, he stepped on the other heaven’s favorites and won the championship. His magnificence made the people of the ancient Moon Holy Land feel proud.</p><p>“Everyone, make way!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. The road was blocked and a large number of people were watching from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue squeezed out of the crowd and flew towards the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Hmph, he’s just a cripple. If he can’t become a divine Emperor, what’s the use of having strong battle prowess at this stage?”</p><p>After Lu Ming left, some people sneered and mocked him.</p><p>Everyone looked over and recognized the WAN family..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
