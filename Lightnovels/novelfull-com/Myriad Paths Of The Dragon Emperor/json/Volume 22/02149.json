Only death awaited him.</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch had given in and was about to admit defeat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved!</p><p>“Treasure? Do you have as many treasures as a great emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>The goateed Emperor’s storage ring was already with him, so why would he need any treasures?</p><p>“Don’t kill me, Lu Ming. As long as you let me go, I’ll lead the wind race and pledge our allegiance to you forever!”</p><p>The wind race’s patriarch shouted out in fear. He didn’t care about anything else in order to survive.</p><p>“No need, just go in peace!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and then slashed with his sword.</p><p>The Wind Clan’s leader tried his best to resist, but it was all in vain.</p><p>Although there wasn’t much energy left in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, it wasn’t difficult to kill a seven-star true Emperor.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A sword light flashed, and the wind Clan’s patriarch was killed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged toward the WAN family’s master and the sect master of the purple Extreme sect.</p><p>Without any suspense, the leaders of the two forces were killed one after another.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming killed several other Masters from the MU family and the Daluo heaven sect. They were all high-level illusionary emperors.</p><p>After killing these people, Lu Ming did not continue to attack. He put away the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body’s energy storage had dropped below ten percent. If he wanted to control it again, he would need to replenish it.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>The strongest experts of the wind race, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect had all been killed. It was difficult for the others to resist. The outcome was already decided.</p><p>This was a day of bloodshed. Not long after, the experts of the Feng clan, Wan family, and purple Extreme sect were almost all killed. The only ones left were those with weak cultivation.</p><p>The people of the top ten forces all smiled.</p><p>The wind race had finally been exterminated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared. It was uncle Kong!</p><p>Tian Luo managed to escape, but he suffered a fatal injury. He won’t be able to recover in a hundred years!</p><p>Said uncle Kong. It was a pity that he couldn’t kill Emperor tianluo.</p><p>that’s good. I’ll personally take the life of that old Tian Luo!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, uncle Kong. This time, an Emperor from the MU clan died. Will they madly seek revenge?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He was going to leave soon. He was afraid that after he left, the MU family would send Masters to deal with Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and other forces.</p><p>the MU family sent a great emperor to Mount Yuan to kill you, but it’s already too much. 1’11 go to the divine land personally. I have an old relationship with one of the Overlord forces in the divine land. 1’11 ask them to take action and restrain the MU family. The MU family is strong, so they won’t dare to act recklessly!</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. In that case, he was at ease.</p><p>Not long after, news of the battle at the wind race spread throughout the entire ancient Moon Holy Land, shocking everyone.</p><p>In fact, not long after, it spread throughout the entire Yuan mountain.</p><p>In this battle, a few powerful forces were annihilated, and even great emperors had fallen. It was truly shocking.</p><p>Most importantly, the great emperor was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s reputation had reached its peak.</p><p>Initially, because of the battle of the ten lands, Lu Ming had climbed to the top. However, he was later determined by the celestial Thearch that it would be difficult for him to become a Thearch. This made everyone in the yuan mountain know about him.</p><p>And now, it was because he had killed a great emperor.</p><p>Countless people were dumbstruck and extremely shocked.</p><p>Previously, there were people who looked down on Lu Ming. They thought that Lu Ming could not become a Martial Emperor because his potential was limited and he would not be able to achieve anything.</p><p>However, no one dared to look down on Lu Ming now.</p><p>So what if I can’t become a saint Emperor?</p><p>He could still stir up a storm and annihilate a few powerful forces in a rage. Blood would flow like rivers and even great emperors could be killed.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming had the celestial Thearch’s physical body, even if he could not become a Thearch, he would be a terrifying existence that even thearchs would be afraid of.</p><p>The outside world was in an uproar. Countless people were heatedly discussing Lu Ming’s name, and Lu Ming was already preparing to return to the Azure region.</p><p>With the destruction of ancient Moon Holy Land, the Wind Clan, Wan family, golden Crow race, Sirius tower, and purple Extreme sect, the resources and territories they left behind were divided up by Phoenix Palace and other sects. There was a relatively big reshuffling in ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming did not participate in any of these.</p><p>He stayed in the great Yan elixir Palace for a few days. A few days later, uncle Kong left for the divine land while Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue, Xue ningxin, and Tian Chui to the Azure continent.</p><p>The grey state, cloud state, and the Emperor state were located in the mountain range of the sea of clouds and were the closest to the sea. They were considered to be extremely remote regions.</p><p>There were very few people from the sacred lands of Mount Yuan who would come to these three states.</p><p>Therefore, there was no public teleportation to this place, and they had to fly.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a puppet that looked like a Goshawk. It was the one that split open had given him back then. Its speed could reach a hundred times that of the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>The four of them sat on the goshawk puppet. The goshawk puppet spread its wings and flew in the direction of the Azure continent at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The speed of the shuttle was so fast that they were like a bolt of lightning. Fortunately, there was a layer of light on the body of the goshawk puppet. Otherwise, they would have been torn apart by the astral wind.</p><p>Below them, there were boundless mountains and rivers. One by one, the Emperor-ranked forces passed by.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming escaped from the cloud Sea Mountain range, he flew for several months and only passed by a few Emperor-level forces. But now, they only used a few days to reach the edge of the cloud Sea Mountain range from ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>After entering the cloud Sea Mountain range, the four of them used the divine breath technique and began to disguise themselves to hide their auras.</p><p>Now, they did not know what the situation in the three states was like. The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others had also fallen into the hands of the other party. Naturally, they could not easily reveal their identities.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was not afraid of the other party at all. However, the best plan was to conceal his identity and rescue the other party first.</p><p>Two days later, they had passed through the cloud Sea Mountain range and arrived at Yunzhou.</p><p>senior brother, Senior Sister, hide your identities and wait here at the cloud plane. Qiuyue and 1 will go back to the Azure plane and see if we can save master and the others!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Alright, be careful, Junior Brother!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin nodded.</p><p>They also understood that they were not powerful enough. They would not be of much help if they followed Lu Ming.</p><p>They were prepared to gather information in Yunzhou.</p><p>The four of them split up. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue headed towards the Azure continent while Tian Chi and Xue ningxin stayed in the clouds Plains to gather information.</p><p>Although they didn’t take the puppet, with Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s current speed, they crossed the entire cloud plane and most of the Azure plane’s territory in an hour and arrived near Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The two of them stood high in the sky, looking at Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Today, Dragon God Valley was very different from the past.</p><p>In the past, snow had covered Dragon God Valley year after year. That was because the Ice Dragon patriarch lived in the depths of Dragon God Valley. The Ice Dragon patriarch was cultivating, and the temperature was too low, causing snow to fill the sky.</p><p>But now, the ice and snow had melted, and the vegetation was flourishing. Dragon God Valley was full of vitality.</p><p>Occasionally, there would be figures coming in and out.</p><p>“The people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and there was a cold glint in them..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
