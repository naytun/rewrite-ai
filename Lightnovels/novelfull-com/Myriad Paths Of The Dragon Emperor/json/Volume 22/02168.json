In the blink of an eye, they were close to the divine Spirit fruit tree.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a hand and with a grab, a huge hand condensed and grabbed one of the Holy Spirit fruits, putting it away.</p><p>Then, he tried to grab the second one.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>One of the sovereign race’s experts shouted and slashed at Lu Ming with his sword.</p><p>This was an expert in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage. In the eyes of everyone in the divine wilderness continent, this sword was extremely terrifying. It was completely impossible to resist. Even if they were hit by a sliver of the sword’s sharpness, they would be crushed to pieces.</p><p>“That brat is dead!”</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>Han Zhong and the other three also shook their heads and sighed.</p><p>But the next moment, their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at it. He slapped out with his palm and shattered the sword light. Then, he grabbed another Holy Spirit fruit with his palm.</p><p>“Block… He blocked it?”</p><p>“No… He didn’t blockit, but shattered the sword light!”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Han Zhong and the other three were the same.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming block the sword gleam, but he also shattered it with one palm. He looked very relaxed.</p><p>The sovereign race expert’s eyes narrowed, and then a cold killing intent burst forth.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He abandoned his opponent and charged at Lu Ming with the Emperor sword in his hand. The sword’s radiance soared into the sky and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Illusionary spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He took a step in the air and countless runes appeared.</p><p>Then, these runes turned into a black shadow. It was like a death god holding a Death Scythe.</p><p>It was really formed from the array Dao laws ‘illusionary spirit scroll.</p><p>The illusionary spirit scroll could create any living being. Lu Ming had used the illusionary spirit scroll to create a death god.</p><p>The Grim Reaper wielded his scythe and slashed at the monarch race expert.</p><p>The first slash caused the monarch race expert to retreat and spit out a large mouthful of blood. The second slash caused his head to be separated from his body and he died a violent death.</p><p>Gulu! “Gulp!”</p><p>The sound of people swallowing their saliva could be heard.</p><p>Everyone was really shocked. The scene was deathly silent.</p><p>An expert in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage was invincible in the eyes of the people of the divine wilderness continent. But now, Lu Ming had condensed a death god and killed him in two strikes.</p><p>What kind of combat strength was this?</p><p>Could this young man be an Emperor-to-be?</p><p>This scene made the people from the other three forces of the yuan continent reveal solemn expressions.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed one of the monarch race’s members, he reached for the third Holy Spirit fruit.</p><p>“Everyone, why don’t we join forces and kill this man first before we fight for the Holy Spirit fruit?”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the monarch race said.</p><p>“That’s what 1 was thinking. This person has no respect for anyone and doesn’t put us in his eyes at all. He should be killed!”</p><p>One of the divine ox Palace’s people said indifferently.</p><p>Very soon, the three parties came to an agreement. They stopped fighting and then suddenly charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you kill the people of my monarch race? die!”</p><p>“You dare to pluck the Holy Spirit fruit?! Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The experts from the sovereign race, divine ox Palace, and manlong Palace all charged at Lu Ming, including the Emperor-to-be. Their power was terrifying.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming was an Emperor-to-be, he would be blown up in an instant.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming was an Emperor-to-be, he was not an ordinary one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exploded and struck out with his palm.</p><p>This palm was like a heavenly blade, even the space was cut open.</p><p>One had to know that the current divine wilderness continent was no longer the same as it was in the past. The current space was extremely stable and was not any weaker than the yuan continent.</p><p>Even an Emperor-to-be couldn’t break the space.</p><p>Everyone’s attacks were completely routed.</p><p>A terrifying power gushed out, and nearly twenty experts were severely injured. Their bodies trembled violently, and they spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>A few of the weaker ones exploded.</p><p>“Illusionary spirit!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stretched out his hand and pointed. Countless runes appeared and turned into dozens of death gods.</p><p>These death gods were not simply condensed from array Dao laws. There were also other laws contained within.</p><p>Dozens of Grim Reapers charged toward the people from the three forces.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and heads rolled!</p><p>The people from the three forces had been severely injured by Lu Ming with one move. How could they withstand the attack of the death god? they were killed one by one.</p><p>In just a few breaths, all the experts from the three forces were killed. Not a single one was left.</p><p>Lu Ming plucked the nine Holy Spirit fruits one by one.</p><p>it seems like the legends were wrong. It’s impossible for a Holy Spirit fruit to directly create a Saint realm expert!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the last Holy Spirit fruit and studied it carefully.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current vision and his understanding of the alchemy Dao laws, he could see the effects of some sacred elixirs very clearly.</p><p>It was impossible for the Holy Spirit fruit to be like the legends, where one could directly create a Saint realm expert after consuming it.</p><p>However, if a person in the third stage of the half-Saint realm took it, it could indeed increase the chances of becoming a saint and condensing the Saint heart.</p><p>Speaking of which, it was also a rare fruit.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was petrified.</p><p>Some of them rubbed their eyes, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>Many of the experts from the three forces of the yuan continent, including many Emperor-to-be, were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Especially Han Zhong and the other three, they were extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had come with them.</p><p>The burly man, who had mocked Lu Ming previously, was in a cold sweat and was filled with fear.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to argue with him, he could blow him to death with a breath. “Qiuyue, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked over with Qiu Yue. When he passed by Han Zhong and the other three, he waved his hand and a wave of energy wrapped around the four of them, bringing them away into the sky.</p><p>The others only reacted after a long while and immediately burst into an uproar.</p><p>They guessed that Lu Ming should be an expert from the yuan continent. Otherwise, he could not be so powerful.</p><p>However, they did not know Lu Ming’s name. Therefore, the name ‘black-faced Grim Reaper’ spread and shook the entire divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Han Zhong and the other three to travel ten thousand miles in an instant. They only stopped after they had left the mountain range. “Alright, this place is safe!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently and then left with Qiu Yue. They disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Han Zhong and the other three were in a daze, and then they sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue headed south. They soon left the Northern Plains and arrived at the central continent.</p><p>The central continent was extremely prosperous, with many large cities standing between heaven and earth.</p><p>This was something that didn’t exist in the past. It was obviously built in recent years.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue found a large city and entered it.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to find out the specific situation of the Dragon Alliance and how the people in the Dragon Alliance were doing.</p><p>The best place to gather information was a restaurant.</p><p>This was a human’s characteristic. In a restaurant, one could reveal many secrets by eating and drinking while chatting.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue entered a large restaurant and ordered some food and wine.</p><p>Lu Ming spread his spiritual sense and listened to the others chatting.</p><p>A series of voices entered Lu Ming’s ears. Not long after, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He had indeed heard some useful information..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
