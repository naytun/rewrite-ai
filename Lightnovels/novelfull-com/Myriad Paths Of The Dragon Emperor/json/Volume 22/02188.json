This place was filled with terrifying killing intent and the immortal marks left by the peerless experts would actively kill the experts who entered this place. Therefore, it was impossible to enter this hell in the past.</p><p>However, not long ago, a change occurred. This area became accessible.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the armored figure he had seen before. He held a spear in his hand and was shouting to kill. Could it be that the figure had died in the battle back then and left behind an inextinguishable mark?</p><p>However, his cultivation was too weak, so the mark did not attack him.</p><p>To those peerless powerhouses in the world, his cultivation base was indeed too weak.</p><p>could the changes in this area be related to the great battle? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it and felt that it was very likely.</p><p>however, this area still has the mark of a peerless expert. Those below the true Emperor realm won’t be in trouble if they enter, but it’s hard to say for those above the true Emperor realm. The higher their cultivation, the more dangerous it is. So, this is our chance!</p><p>The blue-robed young man’s eyes flashed with a fiery light.</p><p>Then, the blue-robed young man looked at Lu Ming with an inexplicable smile at the corner of his mouth, brother Lu, since you’ve come here by accident, why don’t we travel together? if we encounter any opportunities, we can split them equally!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p>He had just arrived in the heaven realm and had many questions to ask. It was best to have a companion.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them moved forward together.</p><p>However, the three of them didn’t dare to move too fast. No one had entered this ancient battlefield since ancient times. No one knew what dangers there would be.</p><p>Not long after, the three of them encountered another inextinguishable imprint.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a human, but a giant bird. Its aura was wild, and its killing intent soared into the sky.</p><p>The bird’s cold gaze swept over the three of them, but it didn’t make a move. After a while, it disappeared.</p><p>The three of them heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, their cultivation wasn’t strong. If it had been a powerful existence, they would probably have been attacked by these marks.</p><p>These imprints were definitely extremely powerful when they were alive.</p><p>Legend had it that this battlefield was one of the most powerful battlefields between the heaven realm and the alien race. Those who could participate in the battle were all unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Therefore, the marks left behind by these powerhouses were also extremely terrifying.</p><p>He had once entered this place with a great emperor and was immediately killed by the imprint. Even a heavenly Emperor had entered this place and died.</p><p>From this, one could see how terrifying these imprints were when they were alive.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming asked around and learned a lot of information.</p><p>The blue-robed young man was called LAN Yun.</p><p>The middle-aged man was called LAN Songshi!</p><p>They were outside the battlefield, training in the camp of the Tai Qing heavenly region and fighting with the alien races.</p><p>This time, many people knew about the changes in the ancient battlefield. In addition to them, many people from the heaven realm army camp had also rushed over.</p><p>After all, the people who had participated in the battle were too powerful. Even though countless years had passed and many things might have rotted, there might still be some treasures left that hadn’t rotted. As long as one could obtain one, it would be a great opportunity.</p><p>It was not surprising that many people came to explore.</p><p>The alien races would probably send people over as well.</p><p>The three of them continued to search the area.</p><p>However, the place was deathly silent and empty. There was nothing there.</p><p>Two hours later!</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Suddenly, their eyes lit up.</p><p>In front of him was a messy pile of rocks. In the middle of the rocks was a skeleton. From his posture, he seemed to be sitting on the ground. In his hand was a Broken Sword.</p><p>Once a martial arts expert reached the Saint realm, it would be extremely difficult for his body to corrode.</p><p>At the Martial Emperor realm, one’s physical body was said to be immortal.</p><p>But everything was relative.</p><p>It could last for a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand years without rotting.</p><p>However, what about a hundred thousand years, a million years, or even longer?</p><p>With the passage of time, everything would eventually corrode.</p><p>The skeleton in front of him might have been a peerless expert when he was alive.</p><p>The few of them glanced at the finger of this expert, but unfortunately, they didn’t see a storage ring.</p><p>Even storage rings would be corroded over the years, and the items inside could be swept into the void.</p><p>It was obvious that this being’s storage ring had already been corroded.</p><p>Then, their eyes fell on the broken sword in skeleton’s hand.</p><p>The broken sword was indeed covered in rust, but after such a long time, even the physical body and storage ring of this unparalleled expert had been corroded. However, the broken sword had remained.</p><p>This was definitely a shocking treasure.</p><p>Especially LAN Yun and LAN Songshi, their eyes were shining with a fiery light.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why don’t you go and get the broken sword?”</p><p>LAN Yun spoke and looked at Lu Ming with a faint smile.</p><p>“I’ll go?”</p><p>There was a glint in Lu Ming’s eyes, but it disappeared in a flash.</p><p>This LAN Yun actually asked him to get the broken sword.</p><p>He definitely did not have good intentions and wanted to give the broken sword to Lu Ming. He wanted Lu Ming to test the waters.</p><p>After the death of such a peerless expert, even though countless years had passed, no one knew what kind of danger would befall them.</p><p>What if the other party had left behind a trace of Qi, or left behind some backup plan? to take his Broken Sword would be courting death.</p><p>“Go quickly and bring me the broken sword!”</p><p>LAN Songshi also spoke, his voice cold.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He finally understood why LAN Yun was so kind to answer his question and even invited him to go with him.</p><p>His goal was to use him as a test stone. If there was any danger, he would be the first to go.</p><p>“Brother Lu, hurry up!”</p><p>LAN Yun urged. At the same time, he moved and formed a corner with LAN Song Shi to block Lu Ming’s retreat.</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go get it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. He stepped forward and walked toward the skeleton.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He was highly focused and his spiritual senses constantly scanned the skeleton and the broken sword. However, he did not find any abnormalities or any danger.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He held the celestial Emperor’s sword in his hand.</p><p>Now that Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had stored more than ten percent of its energy, the celestial Emperor’s sword could burst out with a powerful force. If anything went wrong, he could use the celestial Emperor’s sword to block.</p><p>As he slowly approached the skeleton, he still didn’t sense any danger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual sense was focused on the broken sword.</p><p>The broken sword was undying, so the most dangerous part was definitely the broken sword.</p><p>However, from a close distance, he could feel that the broken sword seemed to have lost its spirituality and was no different from a piece of scrap metal.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed at the air. A palm condensed from Saint energy grabbed at the broken sword.</p><p>“Saint energy? You haven’t become a saint Emperor yet?”</p><p>Seeing the Holy power surging in Lu Ming’s palm, LAN Yun smiled in disdain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
