How was he going to break out of their encirclement, head to the Tai Qing heavenly region, or return to the primordial realm?</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows deeply.</p><p>“I don’t care anymore. 1’11 heal my injuries first!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sat cross-legged, starting to channel his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>Now, his body’s recovery speed was amazing. In less than half a day, his injuries were completely healed and his cultivation was back to its peak.</p><p>“Let’s observe the surroundings first!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to observe and see where he was.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and flew forward.</p><p>Looking around, all he could see was a desolate land.</p><p>Ravines and pits covered the entire land.</p><p>There were no living creatures or vegetation, only the howling wind.</p><p>“Could this be an ancient battlefield?”</p><p>Looking at the ravines and potholes on the ground, it looked like a battle between experts.</p><p>“I wonder if that passageway has been destroyed?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the passageway. Now, he hoped that the passageway had been destroyed. If it was not destroyed and the alien races rushed in, he would be finished.</p><p>However, before Lu Ming was swept away, he saw that the entire passage had exploded and shattered. It should be destroyed!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, a roar rang out, and a shocking killing intent filled the air.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. All the hair on his body stood on end. The Holy power in his body circulated involuntarily. His body turned into a rainbow light and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, no one chased after him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The voice then came from the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look in that direction.</p><p>In the sky, light filled the air, and a figure appeared.</p><p>This figure was clad in iron armor and holding a spear. His entire body was emitting a shocking killing intent as he roared.</p><p>“This is not. real body…”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>He discovered that this figure was not a physical entity. It was not even made of energy. It was just a shadow.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The figure shouted a few times, and a terrifying killing intent soared into the sky. Then, the light distorted, and the figure disappeared like a Phantom.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>The figure was filled with a terrifying killing intent. It gave off the feeling that it was a terrifying expert. However, it had no hostility towards Lu Ming and seemed to not have seen him. After a few roars, it disappeared.</p><p>could it be that an expert who died in battle back then left behind an undying mark?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming observed for a while and did not find anything unusual. He then continued to move forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had not advanced for long when two rainbow lights flew toward him at high speed.</p><p>“Two humans!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see that there were two humans in the two beams of light and not the evil god tribe.</p><p>The fact that the human race could come here meant that Lu Ming’s previous speculation was wrong. This place was not the eight-heaven domain that was occupied by the evil god tribe.</p><p>The two of them had obviously seen Lu Ming and flew toward him.</p><p>As they neared, the rainbow light receded, revealing two figures.</p><p>One of them was a young man in a blue robe. He was tall and strong, and he exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>There was also a burly middle-aged man in battle armor. The aura he gave off was also extremely powerful.</p><p>“A three-star void Emperor and a four-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered slightly.</p><p>That young man was a three-star illusionary Emperor. At such a young age, he had already reached this stage. He was definitely a heaven’s pride figure.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a four-star void Emperor!</p><p>The two of them sized Lu Ming up carefully. The young man looked surprised.</p><p>“Brother, how should I address you? I’ve never seen you in the military camp before!”</p><p>The blue-robed youth cupped his fists.</p><p>“Military camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He then cupped his fists and said,”I’m lu Ming. I’m not from the military camp. I was adventuring in a secret place and was accidentally swept into a void storm and brought here!”</p><p>Lu Ming told a lie.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The young man and the middle-aged man looked at each other, not knowing whether to believe it or not.</p><p>“Excuse me, may I ask where this place is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You really don’t know?”</p><p>The blue-robed man asked.</p><p>“I really don’t know!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>it seems that brother Lu really doesn’t know. Then let me tell you. This is a battlefield between the taiqing heavenly region and the Hunyuan heavenly region!</p><p>The blue-robed youth said.</p><p>“The battlefield between the Tai Qing heavenly realm and the Hunyuan heavenly realm?” he asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and a look of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Brother Lu, don’t you know about the battlefield between the two heaven domains?”</p><p>The blue-robed youth’s eyes were filled with even more doubt.</p><p>I’ve been cultivating on an island overseas and adventuring overseas. Although I’ve heard about the battlefields of the Great War with the alien races, I’m not very clear about them. Please give me some advice!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said politely.</p><p>“So you’re from overseas. No wonder. Let me tell you …”</p><p>The blue-robed young man began to explain.</p><p>as we all know, there are nine heaven regions in the heaven realm. The nine heaven regions are like Nine Worlds. They are connected to each other by passages. However, the passages between heaven regions are not void passages, but the earth!</p><p>the heavenly regions are connected by the earth, like a long and wide road. This is the passage between the Hunyuan heavenly region and the Tai Qing heavenly region. Because of the invasion of the alien tribes, the passage between the two heavenly regions has become a battlefield!</p><p>The blue-robed man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. The Hunyuan heavenly realm had been occupied by the alien tribes. This was the battlefield between the Tai Qing heavenly realm and the Hunyuan heavenly realm. If the alien tribes wanted to invade the Tai Qing heavenly realm, they would have to attack from here.</p><p>No wonder there were alien races and humans here.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and felt more at ease.</p><p>It was better to come to the battlefield between the two heaven domains than to go to the other heaven domains that were already occupied by the alien races.</p><p>the hell we are in now is even more special. It is the most ancient battlefield. Countless years ago, there was a terrible war here. It was said that those who participated in the war were the most terrifying experts in the world. After that war, this ancient battlefield was silent for eternity. No outsiders could enter!</p><p>The blue-robed youth said.</p><p>“Outsiders can’t enter? Then, we …”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>the reason why we couldn’t enter before was that there was a fierce battle between the heaven realm and the top powerhouses of the foreign kinds. Countless peerless powerhouses died in the battle, and this place is filled with endless killing intent. Many peerless powerhouses left behind immortal marks after their deaths!</p><p>those marks can sense the people who come in here. Once they sense a powerful existence, they will attack and kill the powerful existence!</p><p>however, not long ago, there was a huge change in the battlefield. Things have taken a turn for the better. As long as one’s cultivation is not too high, they can enter!</p><p>brother Lu, you’re quite lucky. This is a battlefield of ancient peerless powerhouses. Although countless years have passed, there might still be peerless treasures left behind. Now, many people have come here to explore!</p><p>The blue-robed young man continued to explain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
