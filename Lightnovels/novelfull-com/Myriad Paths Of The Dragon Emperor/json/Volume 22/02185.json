At that time, Lu Ming had just stepped onto the path of cultivation.</p><p>In the early stages of Lu Ming’s cultivation, Mu Lan had been of great help to him.</p><p>However, as time passed, Lu Ming’s cultivation continued to improve. The gap between the two of them grew wider and wider. Their relationship seemed to be growing further and further apart.</p><p>“Senior mu Tian, senior Yan LAN, don’t worry. 1’11 definitely find Senior Sister Mu Lan and bring her back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? You want to enter that passage too? Don’t act rashly, we don’t know where that passage leads to and what dangers it has. If you rashly enter, I’m afraid you’ll put yourself in danger!”</p><p>Yan LAN advised.</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry. I’m confident!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In fact, he had already wanted to explore that passage.</p><p>But previously, he had just returned to the divine wilderness. He wanted to spend more time with Lu Yuntian and Li Ping because he did not know where this passageway led to. If he were to go, it would take a long time before he could return.</p><p>Furthermore, during this period of time, he had let Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body absorb the orirocks, and the energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had already exceeded ten percent.</p><p>Now that he could control Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, he was much more confident.</p><p>Especially now that he heard that Mu Lan had entered that passageway six years ago, Lu Ming was even more determined to go and explore.</p><p>The few of them chatted for a while more before Lu Ming took his leave!</p><p>Before he left, Lu Ming left behind a storage ring. Lu Ming stored a lot of cultivation resources.</p><p>Lu Ming did not enter the passageway immediately. He had to make some arrangements before he left.</p><p>First, he came to the divine Ruins continent and returned to the Azure continent through the teleportation array.</p><p>If he told Cloud Dragon Valley master about the divine wilderness continent, he could let some of the talented geniuses of Dragon God Valley cultivate in the divine wilderness. At the same time, the two sides could take care of each other.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the Imperial Dragon City and told Xie Luan and the others about the Dragon God Valley incident in the Cang region.</p><p>Then, he left the remaining puppets in his hands, one at the Martial Emperor realm and 18 at the Emperor-to-be realm, to guard the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>After that, he bade farewell to his parents and Qiu Yue, saying that he would be leaving for a period of time.</p><p>After making all the arrangements, Lu Ming came to ninedragons once again, at the passageway.</p><p>Now, there was only one dragon vein left!</p><p>More than half a year ago, another dragon vein rushed into the passage and disappeared.</p><p>He didn’t know when the Last Dragon vein would rush in.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, please be alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then took a step forward and rushed into the passage.</p><p>The White mist of the original Qi in the passage greatly hindered one’s vision. Even Lu Ming could only see a few dozen miles ahead.</p><p>This passageway was extremely large, at least a few thousand miles wide.</p><p>Lu Ming found the right direction and flew toward the front of the passage.</p><p>It was silent all around. Lu Ming had been flying for three days but he had yet to reach the end of the passage.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Suddenly, after Lu Ming had flown for a distance, his field of vision suddenly widened.</p><p>The origin Qi here was no longer a mist, but a liquid. The liquid origin Qi floated around like ribbons.</p><p>Without the mist of the original Qi blocking his vision, Lu Ming could see his surroundings clearly.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked at the sight of his surroundings.</p><p>The tunnel was no longer surrounded by stone walls, but pitch-black darkness. Spatial energy storms constantly surged, but the walls seemed to be a barrier that blocked the spatial energy outside the tunnel.</p><p>This was a void passage!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked!</p><p>This place was definitely no longer in the divine wilderness continent. It was in the chaotic void.</p><p>Where did this lead to?</p><p>Lu Ming observed with rapt attention and then continued to move forward.</p><p>He seemed to be traveling through the void. In the void passageway, he had only walked one mile, but in reality, he had already traveled a long distance.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming advanced for another seven days!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a series of rumbles came from the front, as if there were people fighting.</p><p>He was almost at the end!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he sped up.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As Lu Ming moved forward, the rumbling sounds in front of him became more and more intense. It was terrifying.</p><p>Waves of terrifying aura surged from the front, making Lu Ming feel a sense of fear.</p><p>He did not know how far away they were, but Lu Ming already had such a feeling. What was the cultivation of the people who were fighting?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were a little solemn!</p><p>However, since he was already here, there was no reason to turn back. No matter what, he had to take a look in front and see what was ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. The rumbling sounds in front of him continued.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar came from behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Wasn’t the divine wilderness continent right behind him?</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The roars of a Dragon could be heard as a true dragon flew over.</p><p>“It’s indeed a dragon vein!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Behind them was the Last Dragon vein of ninedragons. On the head of the Dragon vein was a huge Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which was flying toward them at an amazing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly stepped aside, or he would be hit by the Dragon vein.</p><p>The Dragon vein whizzed past. Lu Ming seized the opportunity and leaped onto the Dragon vein.</p><p>The Dragon vein itself was a giant dragon-shaped mountain range. It was huge and tens of millions of miles long, but now it had shrunk many times.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the Dragon vein and charged forward with it.</p><p>Not long after, he saw light ahead.</p><p>They had reached the exit!</p><p>But here, an even more shocking explosion came.</p><p>The Dragon vein let out a long roar and rushed out of the cave.</p><p>The moment he rushed out of the cave, Lu Ming leaped into the dragon vein. He realized that outside the cave was a pitch-black land.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the ground and looked into the distance. His pupils dilated rapidly.</p><p>In the void in front of them, there were eight huge true dragons. No one knew how big they were, but they stretched across the sky and earth.</p><p>On top of each of the eight true dragons, there was a huge cauldron that was emitting a bright light.</p><p>At this moment, the ninth dragon vein rushed over and also turned into a giant true dragon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron trembled. The nine Cauldrons emitted a brilliant light and resonated.</p><p>In front of the nine true dragons, there were two huge demonic shadows.</p><p>Their bodies were as tall as the sky, and they were stuck in the clouds.</p><p>The auras given off by the two demonic shadows were earth-shattering. Although they were a great distance away from Lu Ming, he still felt a sense of horror and a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Lu Ming did not feel this feeling even when he was with heavenly Emperor Kong Yin.</p><p>this is the evil god tribe …</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his gaze on them. Although they were very far away, he could roughly judge from their appearance that the two demonic shadows belonged to the evil god tribe.</p><p>such a terrifying evil god race. Could this be the heaven realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine giant true dragons converged, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron glowed as it fought the two demonic shadows. The scene was earth-shattering.</p><p>Each strike gave people the feeling that it could destroy the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
