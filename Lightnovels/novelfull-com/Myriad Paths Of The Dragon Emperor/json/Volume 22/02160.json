He attacked and killed him immediately.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose was lying limply on the ground, no longer breathing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you…”</p><p>At the side, the others were shocked. They did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He took a step forward and a terrifying pressure instantly pressed down.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few of the people who were with the hook-nosed elder didn’t even have time to scream before their bodies exploded and they died on the spot.</p><p>“If you want to die, kill them all!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice caused the remaining people’s faces to change drastically, and they looked extremely frightened.</p><p>Do you want to die Here, or do you want to fulfill your promise and leave the three states?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was sharp as a knife as he looked at the remaining people.</p><p>Those people regretted it so much. If they had known this would happen, they would have followed Lu Ming to attack the DI family.</p><p>However, at that time, they thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. Those people who came with Lu Ming were fools. They were not that stupid.</p><p>Now, it was proven that they were the stupid ones.</p><p>The people who came with Lu Ming were the wisest. From now on, they would divide the three prefectures. How great would that be?</p><p>However, there was no more for them. If they stayed, they would die!</p><p>Lu Ming was obviously not a soft-hearted person.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’re leaving!”</p><p>we will leave the three prefectures. From now on, we will not step into the three prefectures!</p><p>Those people were helpless. In the end, they spoke one after another, then rose up and flew in the direction of the mountain range of the cloud Sea.</p><p>“Good kill!”</p><p>these people are afraid of death and want to take advantage of the situation. How can there be such a good thing?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and company were extremely happy.</p><p>Next, it was time to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>They didn’t show any mercy to the people from evil spirit. They killed all of them, leaving no one alive.</p><p>However, they didn’t kill some of the weaker ones of the DI family, such as those who were below the rank of Martial Emperor. These people posed no threat to them at all.</p><p>Lu Ming looked for some people from the DI family and asked about the whereabouts of sakra.</p><p>However, these people all shook their heads. They were not qualified to know where sakra was going.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little regretful. If he had known earlier, he would have left a few experts behind to inquire.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming left the DI family and traveled around the three states.</p><p>He was afraid that evil spirit cult and di family still had some powerful warriors, and he had to get rid of them all.</p><p>There were indeed some powerful figures from the DI family and evil spirit in the cloud plane. However, there were no martial sovereigns, only a few Emperor-to-be and some absolute Saints. All of them were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming simply sent his puppets to travel around the three prefectures to hunt down people from evil spirit cult and the DI family.</p><p>A few days later, almost all the powerful warriors of evil spirit cult and di family had been killed. The three prefectures were now truly under their control.</p><p>Half a month later, everyone would hold a grand event in Dragon God Valley to celebrate their freedom.</p><p>At the same time, they were discussing how to divide the three prefectures.</p><p>Now, the cloud Emperor mountain and the DI family were all exterminated.</p><p>As for the original 13 sects in the Azure state, the Tian Yu demon sect, Yu Du sect, blood demon tower, intentionless saber sect, and heaven God sect had all been destroyed because they had sided with evil spirit sect.</p><p>Previously, the remaining forces of the jiuxiao sword sect and the heaven seat King did not dare to fight because they were afraid of death. Their higher-ups were killed by Lu Ming and the rest had retreated from the three prefectures.</p><p>Therefore, the remaining major forces were only the Dragon God Valley, Demon Castle, Linglong Palace, life and death Sword sect, and poyuan family.</p><p>The land of the three prefectures was divided among the five of them.</p><p>But this time, it was mainly because of Lu Ming that evil spirit cult and the DI family could be destroyed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was from the Dragon God Valley. Naturally, he would take the majority of the benefits.</p><p>In the end, they decided that Dragon God Valley would occupy the entire Cang region.</p><p>The demon Castle and the Linglong Palace divided the cloud state equally, while the life-and-death Sword sect and poyuan family divided the Imperial state equally.</p><p>On the second day, everyone was on their way to begin the reconstruction.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley also began to gather disciples to rebuild the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming also joined in and carved a large array around Dragon God Valley.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took out two puppets and handed them to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>These two puppets were equivalent to one-star illusionary Emperor realm puppets. They did not have high intelligence, but they already had spirituality. As long as they were ordered to protect Dragon God Valley, they would fight to the end.</p><p>Back at the divine Vulture sect, Lu Ming had purchased a total of three one-star empty Emperor realm puppets and eighteen Emperor-to-be realm puppets.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was shocked.</p><p>After not seeing him for so many years, he knew that Lu Ming had reached a shocking level. He could even take out a Martial Emperor realm puppet.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming had given the two Martial Emperor realm puppets to the cloud Dragon Valley master was mainly because he was afraid that sakra di would appear.</p><p>He could not stay in the Azure continent for long. Soon, he would have to return to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming told Cloud Dragon Valley master the news about the Ice Dragon Valley master and the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>After hearing this, the cloud Dragon Valley master sighed.</p><p>The Ice Dragon Valley master had passed away, and the Ice Dragon patriarch had disappeared. Now, the only high-level figure left in Dragon God Valley was the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>After that, the cloud Dragon Valley master took over the position of Dragon God Valley master and began to rebuild Dragon God Valley. He collected the resources of the entire Azure region and cultivated talented geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming had also left behind a large number of resources.</p><p>Right now, Lu Ming had too many resources on hand. In ancient Moon sanctuary, he had annihilated the Wind Clan, the WAN family, and many others. The number of martial sovereigns he had killed was shocking.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, he could even open the storage rings of the true Emperor and the void Emperor. How many resources were there in them?</p><p>Like Emperor Cang’s storage ring, he could naturally open it now.</p><p>He had also asked uncle Kong to open the storage ring of the MU clan Emperor that he had killed. The amount of resources he had now was shocking.</p><p>He had left a portion for the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>With these resources and the entire Azure continent, he believed that Dragon God Valley would grow stronger quickly and become the true Overlord of the Azure continent.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the Azure continent for three months.</p><p>In the past three months, the entire Cang region had been completely controlled by the Dragon God Valley. The headquarters of the thirteen sects had all become branches of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Some small forces had also joined Dragon God Valley.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue took turns to give lectures. Everyone in Dragon God Valley came to listen and benefited a lot.</p><p>For example, Zi Feng, the number one genius of Dragon God Valley, had already broken through the shackles and reached the bright Saint realm.</p><p>As for the cloud Dragon Valley master, with the help of Lu Ming’s resources, he had also broken through a barrier and his cultivation base had advanced to another level.</p><p>In the past few years, due to the exploitation of resources by the evil spirit cult and the DI family, the cultivation base of the people in Dragon God Valley had not improved much. Now, with the help of all kinds of top-grade resources, many people had made breakthroughs in their cultivation base and realm.</p><p>It was a scene of prosperity!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming bade farewell to the cloud Dragon Valley master. He was about to return to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue stepped into the teleportation array of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The teleportation array flashed and they left Dragon God Valley..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
