Ger out here!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and pointed his finger in the air.</p><p>After that, to everyone’s shock, deep in the DI family’s territory, in the sky, an enormous finger was formed, pressing down on a Palace.</p><p>That finger was like the finger of a God. Its aura was terrifyingly powerful, causing one to have the urge to prostrate in worship.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a tap of his finger, the palace exploded. At the same time, a few earth-shaking roars were heard.</p><p>A tali figure rushed out and punched out, crushing the huge finger.</p><p>Three figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>They were all three-eyed God race beings, and their auras were terrifying.</p><p>The aura of one of rhe three-eyed gods was extremely terrifying, and it was many times stronger than the other martial sovereigns.</p><p>“A three-star void Emperor and two one-star void emperors. I didn’t expect so many three-eyed God race members to escape here!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and a cold glint flashed in them.</p><p>“You’re the son of chaos, but unfortunately, you’re only in the Emperor-to-be realm. How dare you fight me? You’re really looking for death! ‘1</p><p>The three-star illusionary Emperor of the evil god tribe spoke with a cold voice. He took a step forward and approached Lu Ming at great speed.</p><p>Many people from evil spirit cult and di family were overjoyed.</p><p>It turned out that they had so many martial sovereigns here. This was unimaginable.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>This Martial Emperor was obviously many times stronger than the previous one. Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were also shocked.</p><p>Many people were horrified.</p><p>There were so many martial sovereigns. How could there be so many martial sovereigns?</p><p>In the past, there were only two martial sovereigns in the three prefectures. One was Emperor Yun and the other was the martial sovereign of the DI family.</p><p>Later on, evil Spirit’s Guardian Kings were born, and the number of martial sovereigns increased.</p><p>However, martial sovereigns had appeared one after another, and the one who came later was simply terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>Could Lu Ming contend with them?</p><p>Many people started to worry.</p><p>1 don’t know how many evil god tribesmen I’ve killed back then. However, there aren’t many evil god tribesmen at the Martial Emperor realm. I’ll start with the few of you!</p><p>Facing a three-star illusionary Emperor, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm, you’re just an Emperor-to-be. You want to kill me? die!</p><p>The three-star illusionary Emperor said coldly. The aura on his body became more and more violent and he threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>This punch directly shattered the space. It was extremely terrifying as it headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>The others were shocked. This kind of attack power was too shocking. They felt that if it hit them even a little, their souls would be scattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming moved as well. He also threw a punch.</p><p>A fist against a fist!</p><p>In this punch, Lu Ming erupted with five types of laws and fused them.</p><p>The two fists collided heavily.</p><p>Lu Ming s fist was very small. It was much smaller than his opponent s fist, which was the size of a water tank. However, when they collided, his opponent’s fist, which was the size of a water tank, immediately shattered and blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The other party screamed and retreated.</p><p>“How is that possible? Your law …”</p><p>The other party roared in disbelief.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give his opponent a chance at all. He charged forward and waved his hand, a combat sword forming.</p><p>This combat sword was the sword of death that Lu Ming had created himself. It was his strongest killing move now.</p><p>With a slash of his sword, the other party could not resist at all. He was directly split into two and lulled in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>A three-star illusionary Emperor was killed in seconds!</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, if he cast the sword of death, even an ordinary four-star illusionary Emperor would be killed in seconds, let alone a three-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>Of course, if it was an illusionary divine who had comprehended many types of nomological laws and had successfully fused them, it would still be impossible.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>This time, everyone was stunned again.</p><p>An incomparably terrifying void Emperor had been killed by Lu Ming with a single sword strike. This scene was too shocking.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were completely stunned.</p><p>As for the spirit-devouring Shakyamuni and the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts, they were calm at first. Although they were shocked when Lu Ming killed a one-star illusionary Emperor, they were also very calm.</p><p>This was because they knew that there was a three-star illusionary Emperor hiding in the depths of the DI family. He could definitely kill Lu Ming easily.</p><p>However, now that a three-star illusionary Emperor was killed by Lu Ming in one move, they were really frightened.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted and attacked. Her Yin Yang wheel charged at Shakyamuni.</p><p>Qin Yue had long known of Lu Ming’s combat strength, so she was not surprised at all. As for the soul-devouring law, it was completely lost in thought when it saw Lu Ming kill the three-eyed God.</p><p>He was originally only a one-star void Emperor and was not Qiu Yue’s opponent. Now that he was lost in thought, he was directly hit by Qiu Yue, and his body exploded, dying on the spot.</p><p>Then, the Yin Yang wheel moved and attacked the Dharma King of ten thousand ghosts.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Dharmaraja of ten thousand ghosts was furious and started to fight with Qiu Yue. At the same time, he was shivering and was ready to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. He had killed a three-star illusionary Emperor in a second with one move. If Lu Ming had come to kill him, he would have died as well.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue knew what he was thinking. She attacked with all her might and stopped him, making it difficult for him to escape.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the three-star illusionary Emperor, he did not stop at all. His figure flickered and he charged towards the other two one-star illusionary Emperor three-eyed divine race members.</p><p>The two three-eyed gods were horrified and instinctively wanted to escape. However, with a flash of sword light, their heads were separated from their bodies and their souls were annihilated.</p><p>After killing the two three-eyed gods, Lu Ming stepped into the air and charged toward the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>The Dharmaraja of ten thousand ghosts was almost scared to death. He frantically attacked Qiu Yue, trying to escape.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue was not weaker than him. He could not escape at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>“No, I surrender…”</p><p>The Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts shouted hysterically.</p><p>However, as the sword of death fell, the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts was cut in half. Under the remaining power of the sword of death, the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts ‘body was destroyed inch by inch.</p><p>Everyone was shocked beyond words.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>All the martial sovereigns were dead!</p><p>From the moment Lu Ming made his move, he had killed five martial emperors in a row. Everyone thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>In particular, the sect masters of the sky demon sect and the tianshen sect were almost scared to death.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>They roared and called for people to take them away.</p><p>However, in a flash, Lu Ming appeared in front of them.</p><p>I ve said it before. No one can save you today. You will all die!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The sect masters of the sky demon sect and the tianshen sect looked desperate.</p><p>At this moment, they could no longer have any thoughts of resisting. They were truly in despair.</p><p>Previously, they were overjoyed when they saw the Martial Emperor realm powerhouse appear. They thought that a Martial Emperor could easily kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was like a legend. It had far exceeded their expectations. Even martial Supremes were like clay chickens and pottery dogs in Lu Ming’s hands. They could nor even withstand a single blow.</p><p>In just a short while, their mood had fallen from heaven to hell.</p><p>“Lu Ming, my cultivation has already been crippled. Why must you be so ruthless? please spare my life!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect begged..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
