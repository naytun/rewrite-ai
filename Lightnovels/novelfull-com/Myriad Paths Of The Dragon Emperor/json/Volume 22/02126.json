Everything in the world has a fate. Even the birth and destruction of a world have its own fate. Therefore, the Laws of Chaos are also shrouded by fate!</p><p>The heavenly mandate spoke, and his clothes were whiter than snow, untainted by dust.</p><p>“You can’t control my fate. My fate is in my hands, not the heavens! It’s not up to you to kill!”</p><p>Yuan Xin burst out, and his figure was like a Phantom as he rushed toward Tian Ming. Chaotic laws filled the air, and the chaotic divine fist burst out.</p><p>“You are destined to be struck by lightning!”</p><p>Tianming spoke again, as if his words were law.</p><p>As he spoke, all kinds of lightning, flames, ice, poisonous water, swords, and other things were thrown at Yuan Xin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>die! Yuan Xin waved her fist, and all the lightning and flames were destroyed.</p><p>Tianming, you don’t need to test me. Show me your true strength!</p><p>Yuan Xin strode toward Tian Ming. The aura of two nomological laws emanated from his body. The two nomological laws merged and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force pressed forward, stronger than Bao de’s fist force.</p><p>“Great fate technique!”</p><p>Tianming no longer tried to probe and used the divine ability of the laws of fate.</p><p>He stretched out a finger and pointed it forward. A beam of light burst forth like a ray of light and a Divine Blade, blasting toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s fist force was shattered, and the light of fate continued to blast toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Yuan Xin’s fists kept swinging. In an instant, she had thrown hundreds of punches, shattering the space.</p><p>The light of fate had been blocked and finally defeated.</p><p>he blocked it. Yuan Xin is indeed powerful!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Previously, as long as Tianming used the great fate technique, no one could resist it and was directly defeated. Even someone as strong as Bao de couldn’t block it.</p><p>But now, Yuan Xin had blocked the light of destiny.</p><p>Perhaps, heaven’s will could really go against heaven’s will!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After Yuan Xin destroyed the light of fate, she took advantage of the situation to attack Tianming.</p><p>no one can block the light of fate. Fight with me. Your fate is already decided. You will definitely lose!</p><p>Tianming whispered as he continued to point out with his finger.</p><p>in an instant, dozens of destiny lights shot out.</p><p>These lights took on different shapes.</p><p>Some were in the shape of swords, some were in the shape of sabers, and some were in the shape of Spears. They turned into all kinds of weapons and attacked Yuan Xin. Each one of them was shockingly powerful.</p><p>Yuan Xin raised her fist to block, but there were too many rays of fate light. Each one was extremely powerful.</p><p>Yuan Xin was suppressed and retreated continuously.</p><p>“Yuanxin is no match for him!”</p><p>“The laws of fate are truly invincible!”</p><p>Some people sighed.</p><p>If even Yuan Xin was no match for him, then who else could be Tianming’s match?</p><p>no, Yuan Xin can still fight. He’s about to explode!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Xin’s aura rose sharply again.</p><p>His cultivation base was still at the peak of the two-star void Emperor realm, but his aura had truly skyrocketed.</p><p>“Chaotic divine body!”</p><p>Yuan Xin roared. The endless chaos laws between heaven and earth gathered toward Yuan Xin. His body was undergoing a strange change and turned gray, as if his physical body had become a chaos stone.</p><p>Yes, it was a chaos gem!</p><p>When Lu Ming used the chaos Divine palm, his palm would turn gray like a chaos gem.</p><p>And now, Yuan Xin’s body had become like this.</p><p>This was a terrifying secret technique.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body seemed to have really turned into an indestructible rock of chaos. He kept punching out with his fists, destroying all the rays of fate that were bombarding him.</p><p>For the first time, Tianming’s eyes showed a hint of solemness. His body glowed with a myriad of rays of light. He pointed his finger continuously, and the light of fate continued to burst out, blasting toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>However, Yuan Xin’s chaotic body had greatly increased his battle strength. Each punch could destroy a light of fate, and he charged toward Tian Ming, approaching him at an extreme speed.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Could it be that Yuan Xin was really going to change her fate, defy the heavens, and defeat the heavens today?</p><p>Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Yuan Xin approached Tianming and punched out, penetrating Tianming’s chest.</p><p>However, Tianming’s body was like an illusion. It was like nothing happened.</p><p>fate has determined that I will not be defeated. No matter what you do, it is useless. River of fate, come out!</p><p>Tianming spoke, and a huge River appeared under his feet.</p><p>This was not because his nomological laws had reached perfection and formed a long river, but because it was the legendary River of fate.</p><p>The fate of all living things in the world, everyone’s fate, was in the river of fate.</p><p>Everyone’s fate was already determined from birth.</p><p>Tianming stood in the river of fate, as if he was the master of heaven and earth.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin kept swinging his fists, trying to break through the river of fate. However, when his fist force hit the river of fate, it was like a stone sinking into the sea.</p><p>“Everything in the world is in the river of destiny, and you are no exception, yuanxin!”</p><p>Tianming spoke and stretched out a hand. He grabbed at the river of fate and a figure appeared.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, because the figure that Tianming had grabbed from the river of fate was exactly the same as Yuan Xin, but it could be seen that it was just an illusion.</p><p>“You are destined to be defeated!”</p><p>Tianming whispered and pointed out a finger. A beam of light burst out and hit The Phantom, leaving a big hole in the chest of The Phantom.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Xin’s body trembled violently as if he had suffered a terrifying attack. He tried his best to resist, but in the end, he was forced to retreat more than ten steps. Everyone saw a bloody hole appear in his chest, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>The law of fate was too strange. Tianming had only grabbed an image that looked exactly like Yuan Xin from the river of fate. When he attacked the image, Yuan Xin had actually been injured.</p><p>“Those who defy fate will be punished!”</p><p>Tianming continued to speak and pointed out with his finger again. The illusionary figure was pierced through again. Yuan Xin’s body trembled violently and he retreated continuously. Another wound appeared on his body.</p><p>The scene was silent. This was too strange. Furthermore, the heavenly mandate was too strong. Who could match such strength?</p><p>Then, Tianming continued to attack. Every time he attacked, Yuan Xin had to retreat, and a wound appeared on her body. In the end, Yuan Xin spat out a mouthful of blood and was seriously injured.</p><p>“Alright, this battle ends here. Yuanxin, you’ve lost!”</p><p>At this time, the white-haired old man stood up and stopped the duel.</p><p>He was afraid that Yuan Xin’s injuries would be too serious and affect the later battles.</p><p>Yuan Xin was a little unwilling. In the end, she gritted her teeth and left the fighting ring.</p><p>He knew that he had lost. He was no match for Tianming and could not be number one in the world.</p><p>I’m not strong enough yet. I want to be stronger. Legend has it that the chaos Scripture records all kinds of terrifying superpowers based on the chaos laws. I must get them!</p><p>Yuan Xin was unwilling to give up. She looked at Lu Ming with a murderous look.</p><p>As long as he could get the chaos Scripture, he would be able to defeat Tianming and become the number one in the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
