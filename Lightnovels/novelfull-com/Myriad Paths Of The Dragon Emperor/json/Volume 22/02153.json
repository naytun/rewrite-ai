Wherever his sword-light passed, he lulled a few evil spirit disciples.</p><p>The old man was Lu Ming’s master, the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Kill all these bastards!”</p><p>With a roar, a fierce tiger roared and soared into the sky. With a slap, it killed a few evil spirit disciples.</p><p>He was also an absolute Saint, an expert of the demon Castle.</p><p>Then, more people started to riot.</p><p>All these years, they had been controlled by the restriction and bullied. Now that the restriction was gone, everyone immediately rioted and wanted to rush out of this place.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>From the many demon mountains, terrifying auras rose.</p><p>The evil spirit cult and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had arranged many experts here. Other than the old woman and a few others, there were more than ten absolute Saints. However, there were no quasi emperors as they had all been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>More than a dozen absolute Saints charged at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than ten long Spears were condensed in the air.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long Spears turned into streaks of light and shot toward the absolute Saints.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>“No…11</p><p>The absolute Saints felt the danger and wanted to run, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>More than ten absolute Saints were all pierced by the spear. They died on the spot, falling to the ground.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the fierce tiger were shocked as they looked in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>The moment he saw Lu Ming, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes widened and he looked ecstatic.”Ming er!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was truly ecstatic.</p><p>Lu Ming was the one who had shot those long Spears earlier. He had killed more than ten absolute Saints in an instant, leaving him in a daze.</p><p>He understood that after not seeing him for so many years, his disciple’s cultivation had already completely surpassed his.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the Tian Yu demonic sect was in complete chaos.</p><p>The others saw that the absolute Saint of the DI family and evil spirit had been killed in an instant. At this time, there were no more powerful warriors left.</p><p>The people of the major sects took advantage of the situation and launched an attack on rhe people of evil spirit and the DI family.</p><p>The scene was in chaos.</p><p>“Ming er, let s talk later. Let’s kill the enemies first!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said. Then, he turned into a sword light and attacked the people of evil spirit cult and di family.</p><p>There were no absolute Saints in evil spirit cult and di family, so no one was Cloud Dragon Valley master’s match. The situation was one-sided.</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect had gathered more than half of the people from the Azure continent. In terms of numbers, they had already far surpassed the evil spirit cult and the DI family.</p><p>In the past, he had controlled everyone’s souls, so he didn’t need many people to manage them. Now that the soul restriction had been broken and all the absolute Saints had been killed, the situation was completely one-sided.</p><p>“Qiuyue, finish him off!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue.</p><p>Before this, Qiu Yue did not use her full strength at all and was deliberately fighting with her opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After receiving Lu Ming’s voice transmission, Qiu Yue exploded.</p><p>The laws of yin and yang turned into a terrifying destructive force and blasted toward Shaleyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>“The law of yin and yang, you have a King body!”</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul shouted in fear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dharma King annihilating soul was sent flying by Qiu Yue s attack. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his body almost exploded.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>Dharma King annihilating soul turned around and ran.</p><p>Ordinary martial sovereigns were no match for the king body.</p><p>His talent was limited. Although he had been a void Emperor for many years, he was only a one-star void Emperor. His battle strength was not strong, and he was no match for Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted and waved her hands. Two scimitars appeared and turned into a yin-yang wheel. She charged at Dharma King annihilating soul.</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul roared and tried his best to resist, but he couldn’t. The yin-yang wheel directly penetrated his body.</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul dragged his broken body and fled frantically, but the Yin Yang wheel caught up and crushed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul’s body exploded, and his soul let out a shrill scream that resounded throughout the entire Tianyu demonic sect. Then, his soul was also destroyed and turned into ashes.</p><p>“Shakyamuni annihilating soul is dead!”</p><p>“The martial sovereign has been killed!”</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>A martial sovereign had been killed just like that. Everyone was shocked.</p><p>After that, the morale of all the major sects in the Azure continent increased greatly, while the morale of the evil spirit sect and the DI family’s people was greatly reduced, and they began to flee.</p><p>“Junior Brother, we re going to kill the enemy too!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain’s yang tianzong also charged towards the crowd.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and long Spears were condensed around his body. From time to time, a long spear would fly out. Every time the long spear flew out, it would kill an expert of the enemy.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle. Not long after, the people of evil spirit cult and di family were almost all killed, and no one could escape.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue stepped through the air and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Qiu Yue.</p><p>This was a martial sovereign. Such a young and beautiful martial sovereign made people gasp in admiration.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master, the fierce tiger, and a few others were all in the Saint realm. They flew towards Qiu Yue.</p><p>thank you for your help, Lord Martial Emperor!</p><p>thank you, Lord Martial Emperor!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others all bowed to Qiu Yue respectfully.</p><p>In their eyes, martial sovereigns were supreme beings. They guessed that Qiu Yue must be from ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>They were all shocked. Gu Yue Holy Land was indeed a Holy Land, to actually have such a young Martial Emperor. It was truly shocking.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face blushed and she said in a low voice,” you don’t have to thank me. It was young master who asked me to do it. Moreover, you are young master s family and friends. It’s only right for me to help!</p><p>What?</p><p>Young master?</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Qiu Yue was such a peerless beauty, but she was actually someone else’s servant?</p><p>Such a young martial sovereign was her servant?</p><p>What kind of person was rhe young master that Qiu Yue was talking about?</p><p>Many of them started to look around, trying to find the ‘young master’ that Qiu Yue had mentioned.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue quietly came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue called out softly.</p><p>What?</p><p>Nest!</p><p>What did I just hear?</p><p>The scene quieted down at once. Everyone was petrified. Their eyes were wide open and they stared at Lu Ming in a daze. Their eyeballs were about to burst.</p><p>The young master that Qiu Yue was referring to was Lu Ming?</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were also petrified.</p><p>Previously, they had thought that Qiu Yue was an expert that Lu Ming had invited from the ancient Moon Holy Land. Never in their dreams would they have thought that Qiu Yue was actually Lu Ming’s maidservant.</p><p>With such a young martial sovereign as a servant, everyone felt that their brains were frozen. They were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s really Lu Ming!”</p><p>Many people spoke up and finally recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming’s name shook the entire Azure region. He was the number one genius of the Azure region. Everyone knew about him. Now, many people had come to their senses and were even more shocked.</p><p>“Master, second senior brother, third senior brother, although Qiuyue is my maidservant, I’ve always treated her as family!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and smiled.</p><p>Everyone revealed an expression of “I see..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
