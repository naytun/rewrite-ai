A martial Supreme yet so obedient. This was simply what all men dreamed of.</p><p>However, many people immediately thought of Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>Many people had seen Lu Ming’s attack just now. The absolute Saint couldn’t even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming and was killed instantly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had also broken through to the Saint realm or even the Emperor-to-be realm?</p><p>Many people sighed. When Lu Ming was in the Azure continent, he had already displayed his terrifying talent and suppressed the younger generation. After he became a Saint, he could even cross a realm and kill enemies.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had become an absolute Saint, it would be easy for him to kill an absolute Saint.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with respect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current strength was undoubtedly at the peak of the Azure continent.</p><p>master, where is evil Spirit’s headquarters? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the cloud Dragon Valley master and asked.</p><p>He didn’t see the sect master and the others in the sky demon sect.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master still had a smile on his face. When he heard this, he said,” evil Spirit’s headquarters is in the DI family. Many of its people are there!</p><p>“The DI family?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, a murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“Master, are the people from the Azure continent all here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>no, most of them are gathered here, and some of them are scattered in the original sects. However, there are not many Masters of Evil spirit in those sects. Now that the soul restriction has been broken, 1 believe many people will take the opportunity to escape!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Just like Dragon God Valley, there were also some people, but there were not many.</p><p>“Master, everyone, can you spread the news of this place and let everyone gather here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, I’ll spread the news and gather everyone here. Evil spirit has suffered heavy losses in this battle, so they’ll definitely take action!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master nodded.</p><p>Immediately, everyone spread the news.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had sent the message to gather everyone not to gather strength for defense but to attack.</p><p>He was going to attack the DI family. Once the news of this place got out, the DI family and the evil spirit cult would definitely be shocked. In that case, they would gather all their experts and wipe them out at once.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan, to wipe them all out.</p><p>If they split up, Lu Ming would have to go to one place after another. It was too troublesome.</p><p>The others naturally didn’t know what he was thinking. They thought that he was gathering power to defend.</p><p>The news spread quickly, and the Azure continent, cloud continent, and Emperor continent were all shocked.</p><p>The Azure continent’s prodigy, Lu Ming, had returned with a martial sovereign. As soon as he returned, he had killed a discipline King of evil spirit.</p><p>The fall of a martial sovereign shocked everyone in the three states.</p><p>Within the Azure region, most of the people who had surrendered to evil spirit and were under their control were now free from their control and were rushing towards the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Over the next ten days, more and more people gathered in the sky demon sect.</p><p>Back then, there were thirteen Overlord sects and countless small sects in the Azure region. There were many experts, and for a time, the sky demon sect was filled with people.</p><p>Of course, sects like the Tian Yu demon sect, Yu Du sect, and blood demon tower that had long surrendered to evil spirit sect were already considered members of evil spirit sect.</p><p>However, he didn’t see a single person from the heavenly Divine sect.</p><p>In the past ten days, the three states had been in turmoil. Everyone felt a heavy atmosphere.</p><p>Everyone knew that a great battle was about to break out.</p><p>Evil spirit had suffered such a huge loss that they would not let it go just like that. They would definitely make a move.</p><p>The past ten days seemed calm on the surface, but it was actually the calm before the storm. It was very depressing.</p><p>The DI family was located in one of the best areas in the DI state, where the original energy was rich and the land was full of talents.</p><p>Numerous palaces were situated in this area. The palaces were like the heavenly palaces in the legends.</p><p>During this period of time, the palace was not peaceful. Many people were discussing the same thing, and that was the powerful return of Lu Ming and the Martial Emperor.</p><p>In a Palace, a few people were discussing matters. It was the sect master of the God of heaven sect and a few elders.</p><p>In the past few years, the Tian Shen sect had almost completely relied on evil spirit sect. They were devoted to evil spirit sect, so they had obtained a lot of resources. Their cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds in these years.</p><p>sect master, now that Lu Ming has brought the martial Supremes from the outside world back, it seems like he’s going to annihilate evil spirit cult. Now that the soul restriction has been broken, should we take the opportunity to leave evil spirit cult and leave this place? ”</p><p>An elder asked.</p><p>“Silly!”</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect berated him,”I heard that Lu Ming only brought a martial Supreme back. What can a martial Supreme do?” And let me tell you, the waters of evil spirit run deep. Do you think that evil spirit only has a few Guardian Kings on the surface?”</p><p>could it be that evil spirit has other Martial Emperor powerhouses in the dark? n</p><p>The expressions of the few elders of the heavenly God sect changed.</p><p>that’s right. Therefore, Lu Ming is only seeking his own death. Now, not only can we not leave evil spirit, but we also have to show our loyalty to evil spirit. In this way, we will be more valued by evil spirit!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said with a confident look.</p><p>“Sect master is wise!”</p><p>The elders started to flatter him.</p><p>In another Hall, the sect masters of the sky demon sect and the desire poison sect were also discussing some matters.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hehe, I didn’t expect you to really bring an expert back. But so what? you’re just going to die!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect sneered.</p><p>The atmosphere in the three states became more and more solemn. At this time, Xue ningxin and Tian Chui had also arrived at the Tian Yu demon sect. Seeing the cloud Dragon Valley master, everyone was naturally happy.</p><p>Xue ningxin and Tian Chui had also brought the news that the powerful warriors of evil spirit religion and di family in the cloud region had ail gathered in the main camp of di family.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and gathered everyone to start the meeting.</p><p>ladies and gentlemen, today, all the people of evil spirit cult and di family have gathered in di family. Therefore, 1 have decided to attack di family and destroy them in one fell swoop!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“What? Attack the DI family?”</p><p>“He’s looking for death!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is what you said true?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was also in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to attack the DI family.</p><p>Right now, the DI family had gathered all the experts from evil spirit, unlike the Tian Yu demonic sect. There was definitely more than one Martial Emperor. If they attacked, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>that’s right. I’m waiting for them to gather before 1 attack. 1’11 wipe them all out at once!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Many people were speechless.</p><p>Wipe them all out? With just these people?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
