All of them were very powerful and had terrifying commanders. They were the Supreme martial sovereigns who were invincible in the world.</p><p>The three factions each occupied one side, splitting up the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Among them, the divine ox Palace occupied the best position, which was part of the East continent and the central continent.</p><p>Manlong Palace and sovereign race occupied other territories.</p><p>Among them, the imperial family occupied most of the central continent. For example, the Imperial Dragon City of the Dragon Alliance was under their control.</p><p>The monarch race!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes burst out with a brilliant glow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, more beams of light shot over from the sky in the distance, and more figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>A few of them were wearing Emperor robes and Jade crowns on their heads, like emperors.</p><p>There were a few others who were exceptionally burly and covered in a thick layer of iron armor. There was also a black light permeating the air, making it impossible to see their faces clearly.</p><p>“Di family, and evil god clan!”</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified.</p><p>It really was the DI family. It seemed like sakra Dishi had really come to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Others might not be able to see through the people who were covered in armor, but Lu Ming could tell with one glance that they were from the evil god race.</p><p>It was obvious that sakra Azia had brought a group of strong cultivators to the divine wilderness continent and occupied a large area of territory. Even the Imperial Dragon City was occupied by sakra Azia.</p><p>I heard that Di Yi, the Overlord of a region, came from the monarch race!</p><p>Han Zhong said in a low voice.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you guys to be here!”</p><p>A burly man from the divine ox Palace said.</p><p>these nine Holy Spirit fruits are not bad. Our sovereign race will be taking them!</p><p>A person from the sovereign race spoke.</p><p>“You guys want it? What a joke! These nine Holy Spirit fruits belong to our manlong Palace!”</p><p>A burly man from the manlong Hall said.</p><p>Powerful auras erupted from the three sides as they stood in confrontation.</p><p>Everyone in the treasure-hunting team sighed. They knew that with the arrival of the experts from the three great forces of the yuan continent, they had no hope.</p><p>These people were all too strong!</p><p>Any one of them could easily defeat all of them.</p><p>what do these absolute Saints and quasi-emperors want the Holy Spirit fruit for?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>Although the Holy Spirit fruit was rare, it wasn’t of much use to absolute Saints and Emperor-to-be realm cultivators.</p><p>Unless it was used to cultivate the younger generation.</p><p>“These lowly ants are really an eyesore here. Why don’t we get rid of them first?”</p><p>At this moment, a sovereign race member looked at everyone in the treasure-hunting group with a condescending gaze and a hint of disgust.</p><p>The divine wilderness mainland was just a corner of the barren lands. To them, they were as lowly as ants.</p><p>“That’s good, so these people won’t be a hindrance here!”</p><p>One of the divine ox Palace’s people said indifferently.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Everyone in the treasure-hunting team was shocked.</p><p>“Senior, we have no intention of fighting with you for the Holy Spirit fruit. We’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>“Senior, we’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>Many people shouted in fear and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Are you ants qualified to compete with us for the Holy Spirit fruit?”</p><p>A sovereign race expert sneered and stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, a bright sword light burst forth and slashed in a direction.</p><p>“All, help!”</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Screams came from that direction. They couldn’t resist at all. No matter how high or low their cultivation was, they were all killed in an instant. More than a dozen people were killed in an instant.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The sovereign race’s expert laughed.</p><p>To them, the people of the divine wilderness mainland were not humans, but ants that could be killed at will.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The divine ox Palace’s powerhouses also stepped out, planning to attack.</p><p>“Let’s go, Lu Ming. Let’s go!”</p><p>Han Zhong’s expression changed drastically as he roared.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>On top of Wuyuan mountain, the big tree emitted a bright light.</p><p>Among them, nine Holy Spirit fruits were even more brilliant.</p><p>Rays of multicolored light circulated, and the medicinal fragrance was incomparably dense, spreading in all directions.</p><p>The Holy Spirit fruit was about to ripen!</p><p>The sovereign race and divine ox Palace’s powerhouses all stopped in their tracks and looked at the Holy Spirit fruit.</p><p>Everyone let out a long breath. They knew that they were saved. The strong practitioners of the yuan continent no longer had the mood to deal with them.</p><p>“The Holy Spirit fruit is ours!”</p><p>The sovereign race’s experts all pounced towards the divine Spirit fruit tree.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The experts from the divine ox Palace and the Savage Dragon Hall also charged over.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In order to fight for the Holy Spirit fruit, the powerhouses from the three sides entered a chaotic battle. A terrifying battle erupted in the sky above Wuyuan mountain.</p><p>“So terrifying. Is this the peak existence of the sage realm? He’s really too strong!”</p><p>I heard that the Saint realm is divided into bright Saint, great saint, absolute Saint, and Emperor-to-be, which is Martial Emperor. These people are absolute Saint and Emperor-to-be!</p><p>that’s right. An Emperor-to-be can form a River of laws. The experts of the yuan continent are too strong!</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>Back then, no one in the divine wilderness continent knew about this.</p><p>At that time, a Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert would be an Overlord, and a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert would be a legend.</p><p>Not to mention the Saint realm.</p><p>In everyone’s impression, the Saint realm was a legend. No one knew the specific division of the Saint realm.</p><p>But now, the world had recovered and everyone’s cultivation had skyrocketed. At the same time, the powerhouses of the yuan continent had descended. Naturally, the martial arts realm above that was also spread.</p><p>The battle between the three sides was extremely intense.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s take this opportunity and leave!”</p><p>Han Zhong was kind enough to tell Lu Ming and the rest to run away. If the sovereign race and the other two forces won, they would be finished.</p><p>let’s go. We came here for the Holy Spirit fruit. The Holy Spirit fruit has ripened. It would be a pity if we leave without picking a few!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Then, under the dumbfounded gazes of Han Zhong and the rest, he walked towards the divine spiritual fruit tree.</p><p>Qiu Yue followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Han Zhong and the other three were tongue-tied, completely stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to pick the Holy Spirit fruit when he was facing the powerhouses from the three forces. This was an act of courting death. He was definitely courting death.</p><p>The three forces came from the yuan continent and some of them were Emperor-to-be experts. They were so strong that they could be killed with just a breath.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming was, he was no match for an absolute Saint or an Emperor-to-be. It was impossible.</p><p>The strongest native cultivators of the divine wilderness continent had only just broken through to the bright Saint realm. Compared to the people of the yuan continent, they were far too inferior.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming was from the yuan continent, he was so young. How could he compete with an Emperor-to-be?</p><p>Not only them, the other members of the treasure-hunting team also saw Lu Ming and Qiu Yue walking towards the divine Spirit fruit tree. All of them were stunned.</p><p>“What are the two of them doing?”</p><p>don’t tell me you’re trying to fish in troubled waters and pick the Holy Spirit fruit? you’re looking for death! You’re looking for death!</p><p>he’s really blinded by lard. He’s simply crazy!</p><p>Everyone thought that Lu Ming was courting death. He was dead for sure.</p><p>Picking a spirit fruit under the eyes of some absolute Saints and emperors-to-be was courting death.</p><p>Many people did not leave. They wanted to see how Lu Ming and Qiu Yue would be killed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
