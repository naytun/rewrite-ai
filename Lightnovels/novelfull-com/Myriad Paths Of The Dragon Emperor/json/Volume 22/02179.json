BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, all the experts of the monarch family were emitting a shocking aura and cold killing intent.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A sovereign race expert roared, but his eyes were fixed on the divine ox Palace and the barbaric Dragon Palace.</p><p>Anyone who could kill an absolute Saint in the great circle was definitely stronger than an absolute Saint in the great circle. It was very likely that he was an expert in the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>However, the people from the divine wilderness did not have such high cultivation. It was very likely that they were from the divine ox Palace or the Savage Dragon Hall.</p><p>They suspected that it was the divine ox Palace and the Savage Dragon Palace who had secretly made a move.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that. I didn’t send anyone to attack!”</p><p>“I don’t have any either!”</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace and manlong Palace both denied it with innocent faces.</p><p>who is it? come out! Otherwise, these kids will die!</p><p>The monarch race’s quasi-emperors stepped out and their cold killing intent enveloped the fatty and the others.</p><p>However, an aura burst out from the crowd and crushed the killing intent of the monarch race’s quasi-Emperor. Then, a dark-skinned young man stepped out.</p><p>This young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>He had already used the divine breath technique to change his appearance before coming here.</p><p>“Kid, was it you who attacked just now?”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the monarch race said coldly.</p><p>“You’re asking the obvious!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Are you from the divine ox Palace or the manlong Palace?”</p><p>The monarch race quasi-Emperor asked.</p><p>“I’m from the Dragon Alliance!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to smile.</p><p>Many people were astonished, especially Xie Luan and the others, who were somewhat stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming said that he was from the Dragon Alliance. They did not have such a strong expert.</p><p>Obviously, the Emperor-to-be from the monarch race did not believe him. He thought that Lu Ming was playing with him. “You should be from the yuan continent, right?”</p><p>“It can be considered so!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to smile.</p><p>“You’re alone?”</p><p>The monarch race’s quasi-Emperor asked again.</p><p>“Nonsense, which eye of yours saw that 1 have two people?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>The monarch race’s Emperor-to-be’s eyes turned even colder,” “Sir, you killed a member of my di family. Today, you won’t be able to leave!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the monarch race made his move. He stepped forward and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming smiled and took a light step forward. Countless runes appeared and condensed into a god of death.</p><p>The Grim Reaper wielded his scythe and slashed at the monarch race’s quasi-Emperor.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The monarch-to-be of the monarch race was easily cut in half by the Reaper’s Scythe.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was killed in seconds without even a chance to resist.</p><p>Could it be that he was also a martial Supreme?</p><p>I know who he is! The black-faced Grim Reaper! It’s the black-faced Grim Reaper!</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>what? the black-faced Grim Reaper?”</p><p>that’s him! The legendary black-faced Grim Reaper is a dark-skinned young man who can summon the Grim Reaper to fight. He’s extremely terrifying!</p><p>People kept exclaiming. Many people looked at Lu Ming with respect.</p><p>Three months ago, during the fight for the Holy Spirit fruit at Wuyuan mountain, the black-faced Grim Reaper appeared out of nowhere and displayed his terrifying combat strength, killing the experts of the sovereign race, divine ox Palace, and Savage Dragon Hall in one fell swoop. News of this had spread throughout the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Most of them had heard of the black-faced Grim Reaper.</p><p>However, the black-faced Grim Reaper was extremely mysterious. Ever since he showed his face the last time, he had disappeared without a trace. The three great forces had sent experts to hunt down the black-faced Grim Reaper, but to no avail.</p><p>He did not expect the black-faced Grim Reaper to suddenly appear.</p><p>“It’s him, he’s really looking for death!”</p><p>“He dared to kill the people of my divine ox Palace. Today, 1 will get rid of him!”</p><p>Not only the sovereign race, but also the divine bull Palace and the manlong Palace. They all looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had a smile on his face. He did not care at all.</p><p>“So he’s the backer of the fatty and the others!”</p><p>Many people were moved.</p><p>He finally understood why fatty and the others were so bold and dared to cause trouble. It turned out that the backer behind them was the black-faced Grim Reaper.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, sakra stood up from his seat, and a terrifying aura spread out, covering the sky and earth. Many people trembled and almost knelt down.</p><p>so you’re the black-faced Grim Reaper. But since you dare to show off in my territory today, 1 think you’ve come to the wrong place!</p><p>Sakra said coldly.</p><p>“Your territory?”</p><p>“This is the Imperial Dragon City, the territory of the Dragon Alliance. It’s the territory of the leader of the Dragon Alliance, Lu Ming. When did it become your territory?” Lu Ming said with a strange expression. He’s really shameless!” “Lu Ming? What a joke! A little guy who’s not even a Martial Emperor. How could he be qualified to control Dragon Emperor City?”</p><p>Sakra opened his mouth coldly.</p><p>“Don’t you dare insult my master!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou glared at sakra.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. How dare you insult your master? your Master Lu Ming is nothing. He’s already a thing of the past. If he appears again, 1 can crush him with one finger!”</p><p>Ren qianxing taunted and mocked.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Ren qianxing with a strange expression and said,” I’m right here. Come and try crushing me!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s appearance changed rapidly and he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned when they heard Lu Ming’s words. However, when they saw Lu Ming’s appearance, many of them were tongue-tied and completely stunned.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, it could be said that most people had seen Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming unified the divine wilderness and established the Dragon Alliance. He was the Supreme Leader.</p><p>There were portraits of Lu Ming in all the forces, big and small.</p><p>There was also a huge statue of Lu Ming in the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>Now that they saw Lu Ming’s true form, they were all stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming! It’s really Lu Ming!</p><p>Xia Jiuyang, Xie Luan, and the others were the first to react. They cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“It’s really Lu Ming!”</p><p>“The leader of the Dragon Alliance, Lu Ming, is back!”</p><p>my God, it’s true. He’s so much stronger than before. Even an Emperor-to-be was killed in seconds!</p><p>Countless people cried out in alarm.</p><p>It turned out that the famous black-faced God of killing was Lu Ming, the master of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Then, someone thought of more.</p><p>It turned out that the fatty, Zhuang Xiaoshan, and Zhuang xiaorou’s backer was Lu Ming.</p><p>Could it be that their combat strength had suddenly soared because of Lu Ming?</p><p>“Ren qianxing, what qualifications do you have to be mentioned in the same breath as my master? What’s even more laughable is that he even said that the number one genius in the divine wilderness has surpassed my master!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan looked at Ren qianxing in disdain as he sneered.</p><p>“He’s just a piece of trash. What right does he have to compare himself with Lu Ming? Lu Ming only taught me for a few months, but he can’t even take one of my moves. He’s simply a piece of trash!”</p><p>The fat man mocked.</p><p>H j it</p><p>Ren qianxing’s expression turned unsightly.</p><p>Lu Ming could even kill an Emperor-to-be, his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, if what the fatty said was true, it would be even more terrifying. He had only taught the fatty for a few months and he could defeat him in seconds. He was far inferior to Lu Ming.</p><p>There was simply no comparison, it was simply ridiculous!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
