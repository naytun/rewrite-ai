Although Yun Haoge is the son of time and space, he was born with control over time and space as well. However, there’s still a gap between him and the space-time spirit rat. Therefore, he’s being suppressed in terms of the space-time law!</p><p>The great emperor explained once again.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. The space-time spiritual mouse could only display its true strength after revealing its true form. It could fully utilize the space-time law and even control Yun Haoge’s space-time law.</p><p>It could be said that Yun Haoge was no longer bubbles ‘match.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bubbles traveled through space-time. Her body was small, but wherever she went, space-time accompanied her. Space wrapped around her like water, and endless space-time power charged toward Yun Haoge.</p><p>Yun Haoge roared. He was unwilling to give up and wanted to turn the tables.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useless. At this moment, his control of the spacetime laws was no longer effective.

You’re my human pet now. Chirping, chirping ii</p><p>Bubbles yelled excitedly while Yun Haoge was so angry that she wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Many people were speechless. They could tell that compared to the space-time spiritual mouse, bubbles was still in her infancy. She did not mean to humiliate Yun Haoge, but it was her true intention.</p><p>However, to Yun Haoge, this was a blatant humiliation. He roared in anger and hatred, but in the end, he still rushed down the fighting ring in humiliation and admitted defeat.</p><p>He understood that if he continued to fight, he would only be humiliating himself.</p><p>that guy, yes, that guy has a good relationship with the space-time spirit rat. I’ll take revenge on him later!</p><p>Yun Haoge’s heart was filled with anger. He swept his gaze toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He could not defeat bubbles and could only get back at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming noticed Yun Haoge’s gaze and was speechless.</p><p>Why was this guy staring at him with a face full of ‘resentment’?</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and did not take it to heart. If this guy was insensible, he would not mind giving him a beating when they met.</p><p>Bubbles had won this match.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bubble transformed into a human form again and hung around Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I’m awesome, right?

Come, let big sister hug you!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang walked over and looked at the bubble, her eyes shining.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang had seen bubbles ‘original form. They were so cute that her eyes were practically twinkling with stars.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re so rude. You have to call me Auntie! Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Pao Pao pouted and looked at Lu Xiangxiang with ‘disdain’.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang immediately left with a bitter face, causing Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, and the others to laugh.</p><p>The surrounding people looked at Lu Ming with envy.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming have two sons of God as his disciples, but he also seemed to have a good relationship with the space-time spirit mouse.</p><p>Yun Haoge’s eyes were burning with jealousy.</p><p>“The third match, Yuan Xin versus the ancient devil!”</p><p>The white-haired old man announced.</p><p>The scene fell silent and everyone’s attention was pulled back.</p><p>Two figures stepped into the arena. They were Yuan Xin and the ancient devil.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>They didn’t say much and directly attacked, causing a terrifying collision.</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, punched the air with shocking power. Like mountains, he pressed down on the ancient devil.</p><p>The ancient Devil’s body was covered in demonic light. He cultivated the primordial demonic Dao and had amazing offensive power. He fought fiercely with Yuan Xin.</p><p>In the first ten moves, the two were evenly matched.</p><p>After ten moves, Yuan Xin didn’t hold back anymore, and her full strength erupted.</p><p>A two-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>This was Yuan Xin’s strength, and it had already reached the peak of a two-star void Emperor.</p><p>Two years ago, Yuan Xin had just broken through to the Martial Emperor realm. After two years of cultivation, she had already reached the peak of the two-star illusionary Emperor realm. This speed was already very shocking.</p><p>Every breakthrough in the Martial Emperor realm was extremely difficult and required a large amount of time.</p><p>Some martial sovereigns were stuck in a realm for hundreds of thousands of years and could not break through. In the end, they died under the lightning tribulation.</p><p>It was also because she had entered that space that Yuan Xin had been able to break through so quickly.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s full power was extremely terrifying, and she completely suppressed the ancient devil.</p><p>It wasn’t that the ancient devil wasn’t strong. He was very strong. He didn’t have many opponents at the same level. Unfortunately, his cultivation was still a little weak. He was only a one-star void Emperor, so it was difficult for him to fight against Yuan Xin.</p><p>After a few moves, the elder Devil coughed up blood and retreated. He was defeated by Yuan Xin.</p><p>unfortunately, the ancient Devil’s cultivation is still a little weak. If he could reach the two-star void Emperor realm, he might be able to compete with Yuan Xin!</p><p>“The power of the ancient demonic Dao is really amazing!”</p><p>Some people were discussing the ancient Devil’s potential.</p><p>But the next moment, everyone was even more excited.</p><p>There were four people left, Tianming, Wuliang, Bao de, and Zhua ke.</p><p>The four of them were all extremely terrifying geniuses. They had already broken through to the martial Supreme realm two years ago.</p><p>Next, the four of them were going to fight, and it would definitely be a true battle of the peak.</p><p>“You’re heartless, cheater!”</p><p>The white-haired elder announced, and everyone’s hearts immediately rose.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was a heaven’s favorite who had suddenly risen in the Buddhist League in recent years. He had revealed his unparalleled talent.</p><p>He bragged to the outside world every day that he was the reincarnation of a Buddha God and that his predecessor was an unparalleled mighty person who was all-knowing.</p><p>Although his character was sometimes criticized, his talent and combat power were real. He stood at the peak of the yuan continent.</p><p>As for ao ke, a true dragon who had cultivated the immemorial demonic Dao, his demonic body was unparalleled and he was equally powerful. Who would win?</p><p>Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>Two figures stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Almsgiver, you and I are fated. Why don’t you be my Guardian divine beast?”</p><p>The heartless monk said with a serious expression.</p><p>monk, are you insulting me? 1 will twist your head off!</p><p>Creak’s face revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>Chek came from the land of the divine beasts.</p><p>In the land of the divine beasts, there were all kinds of powerful divine beasts, such as true dragons, phoenixes, Qilin, and so on. They could be seen in the land of the divine beasts. He was the number one genius in the land of the divine beasts. Now, the unscrupulous monk had just opened his mouth and wanted to take him in as a Guardian divine beast. How could he not be angry?</p><p>my hair is white. Benefactor, you want to wring my head off as soon as you open your mouth. Your killing intent is too strong. You must return to Buddha and refine your killing intent!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk said with a straight face.</p><p>Long Chen looked at Lu Ming with disdain. This monk was definitely up to no good.</p><p>“I’ll refine your head, kill!”</p><p>die! ao ke roared, and his dragon roar shook the sky.
