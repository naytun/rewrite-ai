Their cultivation bases were also rapidly increasing.</p><p>The resources that Lu Ming brought back were too abundant, especially the Nirvana pills. Lu Ming bought a lot of them. The bloodline level of the disciples of the Dragon Alliance skyrocketed and evolved continuously.</p><p>In addition to the excellent cultivation environment, the strength of the entire Dragon League was also rapidly improving.</p><p>In the past, the divine wilderness continent underwent a huge change, and the cultivation conditions had changed drastically. However, they did not have any cultivation techniques, nor did they have any mystic arts or martial techniques, so it was difficult for them to achieve a huge breakthrough.</p><p>And now, it was the real explosion.</p><p>In order to obtain domain martial arts techniques, magical techniques, and various pills, more people joined the Dragon League.</p><p>The power of the Dragon Alliance expanded rapidly, covering every corner.</p><p>Not only that, but Xie Luan and the others also sent out an Army to subdue the other continents. The continent group of the divine Ruins was all under the control of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Time flew by, and half a year had passed.</p><p>In the past six months, other than helping others to temper their spirit bodies, Lu Ming did not stop cultivating. He focused on understanding the alchemy Dao laws and his mastery of the alchemy Dao laws became deeper and deeper.</p><p>“Let’s go to ninedragons and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Lu Ming had not been to ninedragons since he came back. He was very curious about what had happened there.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through the air at an amazing speed. Soon, he entered the eastern barren territory and flew toward ninedragons.</p><p>The concentration of the original Qi in the East continent was even more shocking, and countless people were cultivating in seclusion all over the East continent.</p><p>The closer they got to ninedragons, the more concentrated the original Qi was. “What a strong killing intent!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned when he arrived outside ninedragons.</p><p>He could feel the murderous intent in ninedragons.</p><p>In this kind of murderous aura, people with insufficient cultivation would not be able to survive in ninedragons. They would be affected by the murderous aura and even go crazy and die.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even a bright Saint would find it difficult to establish a foothold here. One would need to be at least in the eminent Saint realm to do so.</p><p>There was no one in ninedragons at the moment.</p><p>The original residents of ninedragons had long moved out of the city.</p><p>1 heard that this killing intent fluctuates and disappears for a period of time. At that time, countless people will enter ninedragons to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had heard about this long ago.</p><p>No one knew the reason.</p><p>However, this murderous aura had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and entered ninedragons.</p><p>In the past, there had been nine huge dragon veins in ninedragons. At the head of each dragon vein, there was a Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>There were nine dragon veins, six on the outside and three in the middle.</p><p>But now, there were only three dragon veins left in ninedragons.</p><p>The six outside dragon veins had already flown away. It was said that they had flown into the middle of the three dragon veins in the middle and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming made his way to the center of ninedragons.</p><p>In the center of ninedragons, there were three huge dragon veins. The three dragon heads faced each other, and there was a large open space in the middle.</p><p>Back then, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was built at this location.</p><p>But now, the structure of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had long disappeared. In its place was a huge cave.</p><p>Lu Ming stood at the entrance of the cave and looked over with rapt attention.</p><p>In the cave, there was a white mist. This was formed when the original Qi was dense to a certain extent.</p><p>Extremely dense origin Qi continuously spread out from the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that this should be a passageway but he did not know where it led to.</p><p>The rich origin Qi was coming from the opposite side.</p><p>Furthermore, the nomological fluctuations were coming from the other side, causing the divine wilderness continent to stabilize.</p><p>At the same time, a thick murderous aura was emitted from the passage.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar sounded, shaking the world.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked because the Dragon’s Roar came from one of the Dragon veins.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Then, the Dragon’s Roar continued to resound through the sky.</p><p>Then, the earth rumbled and shook. Lu Ming realized that one of the Dragon veins was moving!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A dragon vein trembled continuously. In the end, it was like a real Dragon that moved.</p><p>The Dragon vein, which was tens of millions of miles long, was like a huge real Dragon. It twisted and finally rose into the sky. Its roar resounded through the sky and spread to an endless distance.</p><p>At this moment, outside ninedragons, people could hear the commotion even from thousands of miles away.</p><p>something is wrong with the Dragon vein of ninedragons. I think another dragon vein is going to fly away!</p><p>every time a dragon vein flies away, the killing intent in Nine Dragons city will decrease sharply. Let’s go. We can enter Nine Dragons city to cultivate for a while and find spiritual and sacred herbs on the way!</p><p>At this moment, countless people were rushing to ninedragons.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>In ninedragons, the Dragon’s Roar reverberated. Then, the Dragon’s Vein shrank rapidly, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron on the top of the Dragon’s Vein could be clearly seen.</p><p>Finally, the Dragon vein roared and rushed into the passage, disappearing.</p><p>“Another Dragon’s Vein has flown away. What’s on the other side of this passage?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious. He rushed in to find out the truth but in the end, he held back.</p><p>What if he couldn’t come back after entering?</p><p>Now, he had just returned to the divine wilderness and did not want to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to wait for a period of time, when the situation in the divine wilderness had completely stabilized, before he would leave and enter this passageway to investigate.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s go to the blood pool to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and disappeared. Not long after, he arrived at the blood pool.</p><p>The blood pool was located on a cliff of a huge mountain. On one of the cliffs, there were three large words: The blood pool!</p><p>Beside the words, there was a platform that protruded from the cliff. Behind it was a cave, which was the entrance to the blood pool.</p><p>Looking at the entrance of the blood pool, Lu Ming reminisced.</p><p>Back then, not long after they arrived in ninedragons, they were hunted down. Jian feiliu’s cultivation was crippled and he was on the verge of death. They brought him to the blood pool, but later, Jian feiliu was taken away by a wisp of his remnant soul in the blood pool and had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming was going to explore the blood pool.</p><p>The blood pool contained a strong murderous aura and killing intent. Back then, Lu Ming could not even go deep into it.</p><p>Before Lu Ming went to the yuan continent, his cultivation had reached a high level and he was able to kill a Martial Emperor. Lu Ming had also been to the blood pool once. However, the blood pool was unfathomable. The deeper one went, the stronger the killing intent. Even with Lu Ming’s cultivation at that time, it was difficult for him to explore the bottom.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was many times stronger than it was in the past. Lu Ming wanted to explore it again.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and entered the entrance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was stunned the moment he entered!</p><p>Originally, the blood pool contained an endless amount of blood. But now, all the blood in the blood pool had dried up, leaving only an empty cave..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
