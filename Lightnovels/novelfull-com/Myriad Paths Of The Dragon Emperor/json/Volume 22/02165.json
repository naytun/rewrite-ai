He was probably a third level martial Royal realm expert, and his combat strength was even higher than Han Zhong’s.</p><p>If the two of them could join them, the strength of their treasure-hunting team would be greatly enhanced.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and refused.</p><p>Why would he join such a treasure-hunting group?</p><p>He was with Han Zhong and the others only because he wanted to go to Wuyuan mountain with them to take a look.</p><p>Han Zhong and the others were disappointed when they saw Lu Ming’s rejection.</p><p>brother Lu, I’m old, so 1’11 give you a piece of advice. Although your cultivation base is not weak, now that the world has recovered, everyone has advanced by leaps and bounds, and there are many experts. Especially when you’re looking for Saint herbs and spirit medicines in the vast mountains, you’ll encounter stronger demonic beasts and more danger. You’ll still need others to help you!</p><p>Han Zhong didn’t give up and continued.</p><p>In other words, although Lu Ming’s cultivation level was not bad, the two of you were definitely not enough. You would need to work with others.</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled but still did not agree.</p><p>young people are still too arrogant. I’ve seen many as confident as you, thinking that you’re strong, but they all died in the end!</p><p>A middle-aged man couldn’t help but sneer.</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense!”</p><p>Han Zhong berated, and the burly man shut his mouth resentfully.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please don’t mind him. He didn’t mean it!”</p><p>Han Zhong explained with a smile.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Given his current realm and standing at a high position, he really did not feel anything about these words.</p><p>Furthermore, as long as he obtained the Holy Spirit fruit after reaching Wuyuan mountain, he would not have any interactions with Han Zhong and the others in the future.</p><p>After that, Han Zhong plucked the seven purple orchid.</p><p>brother Lu, thanks for your help this time. There are seven in total. How about three of you?”</p><p>Han Zhong passed the three stalks of Bauhinia to Lu Ming.</p><p>The six of them had seven stalks of amethyst orchid. However, since Lu Ming had put in more effort this time, he had an extra stalk for him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony. With a wave of his hand, he kept the three stalks of Redbud orchids.</p><p>Then, everyone continued to head toward Wuyuan mountain.</p><p>Along the way, they obtained some Saint herbs, which were divided equally.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying beam of light shot toward Han Zhong from the mountain in front of him.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Han Zhong’s expression changed drastically as he retreated rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The place where he was standing just now suddenly exploded, and a huge hole appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>A total of five or six figures were rushing towards them from all directions. Their cold killing intent sent chills down their spines.</p><p>“Not good, it’s the people from the treasure hunting group, quickly leave! Let’s go!”</p><p>Han Zhong roared and retreated with the others.</p><p>The treasure-hunting teams entered various famous mountains and great rivers to search for sacred medicines and spiritual medicines. In fact, their greatest danger was not the demonic beasts, but the people of other treasure-hunting teams.</p><p>If they encountered a powerful treasure-hunting group in the wild, the other party was very likely to kill them and seize the treasure.</p><p>It was obvious that they had encountered such a treasure-hunting group.</p><p>Han Zhong and the others retreated, but the other party’s speed was extremely fast.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying palm print, as large as a mountain, blasted towards them, enveloping Han Zhong and the others.</p><p>Han Zhong, the two burly men, and a middle-aged woman shouted as they joined forces to block the palm. However, when the palm landed, Han Zhong was still fine and only took a few steps back. The others were all violently shaken and forced to retreat while vomiting blood.</p><p>fourth level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Han Zhong roared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Six figures surrounded them from all four directions, each of them exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>Three of them were at the third level, two were at the fourth level, and one was at the fifth level.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily sense the other party’s strength.</p><p>fifth level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Han Zhong was in despair.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The LV 5 martial Royal realm expert wielded a saber and charged at Han Zhong.</p><p>Han Zhong couldn’t block this blade. He definitely couldn’t block it.</p><p>Han Zhong and the others revealed looks of despair.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming suddenly appeared in front of Han Zhong and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>Han Zhong was shocked.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation was not bad, he would definitely not be able to block this attack. He would be courting death if he blocked in front of him.</p><p>But the next moment, he was stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out two fingers and caught the saber between them.</p><p>The saber stopped in Lu Ming’s hand and could not move.</p><p>“This… This…”</p><p>Han Zhong, the two burly men, and the middle-aged woman’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>That was a slash from a fifth level Martial Emperor. A third level Martial Emperor would definitely be killed by that slash, and a fourth level Martial Emperor would be severely injured. However, Lu Ming had extended two fingers and easily caught the saber.</p><p>What kind of cultivation was this? What kind of combat strength was this?</p><p>The other party’s people were also dumbfounded.</p><p>The person at the fifth level Martial Emperor realm was even more terrified.</p><p>He was well aware of the power of his blade. However, Lu Ming’s finger was as steady as Mount Tai. No matter how he unleashed his power, he could not move an inch.</p><p>“Go, go, leave quickly!”</p><p>The LV 5 Martial Emperor realm expert roared. He knew that he had encountered a terrifying expert. If he didn’t leave, he would die.</p><p>He abandoned his saber and retreated.</p><p>“It’s too late to retreat now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly and squeezed his fingers hard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber shattered into six pieces and shot out. Each piece was aimed at one of the opponents.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The six experts, no matter if they were at Lv 3, Lv 4, or Lv 5 martial Royal realm, were all pierced through by the fragments of the saber and died on the spot.</p><p>Han Zhong, the two burly men, and the middle-aged woman were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Among the six experts, the weakest one was not weaker than Han Zhong. However, he was killed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even take a step.</p><p>Their bodies turned cold. They understood that they had encountered a terrifying heaven’s favorite.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s cultivation?</p><p>Seventh level Martial Emperor, eighth level Martial Emperor, or even stronger?</p><p>They only reacted after a long time.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, it’s my fault previously. You’re a magnanimous person, so please don’t hold it against me …”</p><p>One of the burly men’s face was flushed red as he apologized to Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, he was indignant about Lu Ming not joining them and ridiculed Lu Ming for being too arrogant.</p><p>However, they realized that Lu Ming was not arrogant. He clearly had the ability and did not think highly of them.</p><p>With their abilities, they were of no help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not seem to mind.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the storage rings of the six men and said,” “Let’s go to Wuyuan mountain!”</p><p>The group continued on their way to Wuyuan mountain. However, Han Zhong and the rest’s attitude towards Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had changed drastically. They were now extremely reverent.</p><p>After crossing a few mountain ranges, a huge mountain peak appeared in front of them, piercing through the clouds.</p><p>They had arrived at Wuyuan mountain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
