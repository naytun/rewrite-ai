That’s really laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect had almost taken over Xie nianqing’s body for his own selfish reasons. After that, he led the evil spirit cult and forced Lu Ming to escape from the Azure continent.</p><p>Was it possible to beg for his life now?</p><p>The sword of death was swung out, and the sect masters of the sky demon sect, the sky god sect, and the others were all killed in despair.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar as his Saint energy burst out and condensed into long Spears around his body. These long Spears pierced through the air and killed the experts of evil spirit cult and di family one by one.</p><p>Qiu Yue had also made her move. Now, all the martial sovereigns on the other side had been killed. How could anyone below the martial sovereign level fight against Qiu Yue? they would only be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not show any mercy.</p><p>This was the evil spirit cult, created by the alien race, and it specialized in killing the strong practitioners and prodigies of the primordial realm. There was no such thing as ‘unbearable’, only’ kill ‘them all.</p><p>The DI family, the heavenly God sect, and other forces had already joined evil spirit cult, no different from evil spirit cult.</p><p>The screams rose and fell.</p><p>This was a massacre!</p><p>Lu Ming specifically picked Emperor-to-be, absolute Saints, and Supreme Saints to kill. No one could block a single move. As long as one was targeted by Lu Ming, only death awaited them.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming killed all the Emperor-to-be cultivators.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Soon, evil spirit cult and di family had completely lost their will to fight back, and they started to run away in all directions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and attacked crazily. With a wave of his hand, the spear ray pierced through a radius of hundreds of miles. A few absolute Saint realm experts were blown up in the air.</p><p>At the same time, the 18 Emperor-to-be puppets were also hunting madly.</p><p>The scene was like hell on earth.</p><p>The people of evil spirit cult and di family fell to the ground like raindrops, attack! Don’t let the evil spirit religion survivors escape!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master roared. He led the experts of the various major forces of the Azure region and began to hunt down the people of evil spirit cult and di family who had escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had killed almost all of the enemy’s top experts. The rest would be left to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming did not make any more moves. Instead, he let the eighteen puppets help the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley and the others while he himself went deep into the DI family.</p><p>Even though these puppets had not fully developed their own sentience, they already had a hint of consciousness. As long as an order was given, they would do it.</p><p>The puppets of the shenxiao sect could not be compared to Earth One, gold one, and the others in the chaos Hall.</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the others had already developed their own sentience. Their intelligence was no different from that of ordinary people. Even tu Qian, who was behind them, had his own sentience.</p><p>This wasn’t determined by the strength of one’s battle prowess, but by the strength of one’s puppetry.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the deep end of the DI family. He spread out his spiritual sense, covering the territory of the DI family.</p><p>He did not find anything!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It was strange that Di Shi Tian, the patriarch of the DI family, was not here.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and swooped down. He threw a punch and the ground cracked, revealing an underground passage.</p><p>Lu Ming flew in.</p><p>The underground passage was deep and quiet. Lu Ming kept going down and finally realized that there was another universe deep underground, like an underground world.</p><p>Among them, there were all kinds of treasures of the DI family. Lu Ming accepted them without any hesitation.</p><p>This place should be the place where the DI family hid their treasures and the place where sakra was in seclusion, because there was a faint Emperor pressure here.</p><p>However, he didn’t see many Emperor sakra’s figure.</p><p>Lu Ming circled around and took everything that he could.</p><p>Then, he left the place.</p><p>The moment he came out, he found two groups of people confronting each other.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>One of them was naturally the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others, while the other group was the group that had not come with Lu Ming. The leader was the old man with the aquiline nose.</p><p>Wang, you are too despicable. I asked you to come to the DI family together, but you were afraid of death and didn’t dare to come. Now that the DI family and evil spirit cult have been exterminated, you are here to fish in troubled waters and fight for resources and treasures. Do you have no shame? ”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master shouted.</p><p>“Yun ruoxu, your appetite is too big. Do you want to take it all for yourself? Also, all these years, the evil spirit cult and the DI family have been exploiting our resources. It’s only right that we take back some of them!”</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose sneered and said,” also, where are the storage rings of those evil spirit experts? hand them over. Don’t even think about taking them all for yourself!</p><p>“It’s with me. Do you want it?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master revealed a look of joy.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He immediately knew what was going on.</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose and the others were afraid of death and didn’t dare to fight, but they followed them secretly. When they saw the evil spirit sect and di family being exterminated, they wanted to fight for the resources.</p><p>How could there be such a good thing in the world?</p><p>The hook-nosed elder and the rest looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>Their speed was much slower than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>In reality, they had just arrived. They did not witness the battle earlier, nor did they see Lu Ming’s impressive feat of killing martial sovereigns.</p><p>However, back in the sky demon sect, Lu Ming’s abilities still made them very fearful.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a few storage rings appeared in the air.</p><p>these are the storage rings of some of the most powerful people in evil spirit cult, di family. If you want them, come and take them!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose and the others looked solemn. They didn’t dare to step forward, but the greed in their eyes was very strong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you really going to share it with us?”</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose asked.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the old man with the aquiline nose with a faint smile.</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose knew that Lu Ming was toying with him. His expression turned ugly as he said, Lu Ming, di family, evil spirit cult has so many treasures. It’s too much for you to take them all for yourself. We’re also from the Azure region. We should have a share!</p><p>“What right do you have to split these treasures?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued,” also, I’ve given you a chance to participate in the war. You’re too afraid to die and didn’t come. You even said that you wanted to leave the three prefectures and head to other continents. Now, get lost!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you still want to chase us away? Don’t go too far. The land of the three prefectures is not yours …”</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose said angrily.</p><p>Now, the DI family and evil spirit sect had been destroyed. The three prefectures, the Emperor Prefecture, the cloud Prefecture, and the Azure Prefecture, had become ownerless. Only a few forces were left in the Azure Prefecture. Next, they would definitely be the ones to split the loot. How could they bear to leave?</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t go too far. We’re also from the Azure continent. You don’t have the right to ask us to leave. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you’re strong, unless you can kill us all!”</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose shouted.</p><p>“That’s right, I won’t leave even if I die!”</p><p>Some people followed suit and shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a flash of light, blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>The hook-nosed old man’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>A large hole appeared between his eyebrows..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
