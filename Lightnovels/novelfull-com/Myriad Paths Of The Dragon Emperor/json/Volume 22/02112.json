As time passed, the number of platforms decreased.</p><p>After that, there were a few more people who caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>A true dragon was extremely powerful and had unparalleled offensive power. However, there were no nomological fluctuations on its body.</p><p>A great emperor had spoken and deduced that he cultivated the immemorial demonic Dao!</p><p>The immemorial demonic Dao was also a type of the immemorial system.</p><p>There was another person who was pitch-black all over. He was like an iron tower and had immense strength. There seemed to be no energy fluctuations on his body. He only relied on his physical strength to send a Son of God who had reached the Martial Emperor realm flying out of the fighting ring while spitting blood.</p><p>Everyone was extremely shocked. Some great emperors speculated that this should also be a type of immemorial cultivation system, the immemorial body cultivator.</p><p>He had cultivated his physical body, and his physical strength had reached an earth-shattering level.</p><p>Some emperors explained that in the ancient times of the heaven realm, there were unparalleled experts who cultivated the body. They could strike down the stars in the sky with their physical bodies alone and break through all techniques with their power. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>There was a burst of discussion at the scene.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands was really unexpected, there were too many experts.</p><p>Even geniuses from the immemorial cultivation system had appeared one after another.</p><p>The primordial demonic Dao, the primordial demonic Dao, and the primordial body cultivators appeared one after another, suppressing the Son of Heaven.</p><p>Many people speculated that all three of them could enter the top ten.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw that Xinghe had also defeated his opponent.</p><p>When he came out of the lotus World, the star River had disappeared and never appeared. But without a doubt, this person who had been the number one genius of the yuan mountain had become stronger.</p><p>His opponent was also a Son of Heaven, but he still managed to defeat his opponent with a domineering force, attracting the attention of many.</p><p>After Xing Chen defeated his opponent, the stone platform under Lu Ming’s feet moved forward.</p><p>“Is it finally my turn? Eh, Muyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and his expression turned interesting.</p><p>That was because Mu yang was on the other stone platform.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a murderous intent.</p><p>As for Mu yang himself, he was also stunned for a moment. Then, a killing intent as cold as a blade filled the air.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two stone platforms collided.</p><p>“Haha, tianyun, your luck is really bad. This time, I’ll make sure you die a horrible death!”</p><p>Mu yang let out a cold laugh.</p><p>He was too excited!</p><p>He had been looking forward to meeting Lu Ming. He did not expect that he would really meet him.</p><p>This time, he was going to take revenge.</p><p>“Why do 1 feel like I’m very lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Tianyun has encountered Muyang!”</p><p>two years ago, Muyang was defeated by tianyun and was almost eliminated. However, tianyun did not seem to have improved much in the past two years. He did not break through to the martial Supreme realm while Muyang has already become a martial Supreme. His combat strength must be above tianyun’s!</p><p>in a battle between heaven’s favorites, although combat strength is important, potential is just as important. It seems like tianyun’s potential isn’t good enough, and his future achievements will be limited!</p><p>Some people were discussing. Some people felt that although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, his potential was not good enough. Even if he could become a great emperor in the future, it would be difficult for him to achieve much.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Mu yang walked towards Lu Ming, his Martial Emperor realm cultivation was on full display. His aura was like a Gale, sweeping towards Lu Ming.</p><p>in that kind of environment, you still haven’t broken through to the rank of a martial Supreme. You’re really a piece of trash. In the future, you’ll never be my opponent. No, there’s no future. Today, you’re going to die!</p><p>Mu yang sneered, his aura growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted and charged at Muyang. His eyes were filled with the light of death as he launched fierce attacks.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Mu yang still wanted to show off, but he did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly attack. He did not follow the script at all. He roared and retreated. He pushed his hands forward and the void shattered Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>“Even if you sneak attack me, you’re not my match …” Ah!”</p><p>Just as Mu yang was about to mock Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s attack power and speed suddenly increased. He destroyed Mu Yang’s attack with one palm and slapped Mu Yang’s face.</p><p>Mu yang let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew out like a sandbag, almost flying off the stone platform.</p><p>He was too miserable. His face was already a bloody mess and had almost exploded.</p><p>Many people gasped. Was Lu Ming so powerful that he could beat up Muyang?</p><p>“Despicable man, that was just a sneak attack!”</p><p>Some experts of the MU family were reluctant to admit it.</p><p>“All, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>kill! Mu yang roared and charged at Lu Ming like a madman.</p><p>He burst out with all his strength and rushed towards Lu Ming. An ocean formed by the void law enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Initially, he thought that he could easily beat Lu Ming up. He did not expect that he would be beaten up so badly by Lu Ming at the beginning of the fight. He was so mad that he could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still, letting the ocean of nothingness envelop him.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Muyang roared and exploded wildly. His small world revolved. The power of the world and the void law worked together to turn Lu Ming into nothingness.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by a River of laws, which continuously blocked the invasion of the void laws.</p><p>“It’s just a River of laws. It can’t stop me. Kill!”</p><p>attack! Muyang roared. The ocean of nothingness transformed into all kinds of offensive forces and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? What if I add another one?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Suddenly, another river of laws emerged on his body.</p><p>This was a River of laws formed by array Dao laws.</p><p>Two rivers of laws surrounded him.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Mu yang roared in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had not broken through to the martial Supreme realm, had he? How could he control two laws?</p><p>two laws? how is that possible? ”</p><p>he’s not a Martial Emperor yet, but he can actually control two types of laws.</p><p>One is an ultimate law, and the other is a King path law!</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Many people were shouting in shock.</p><p>He had not broken through to the Martial Emperor realm, but he could control two laws. This was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Only the great emperors looked calm and unsurprised. Many of them had seen through Lu Ming’s earlier actions.</p><p>“I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He shook his arms and the two laws fused. Lu Ming struck out with his palm. Muyang’s void sea trembled wildly and then exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming had attained perfection in five types of laws. After five rounds of tempering, his physical body and Saint energy were too strong, far beyond the martial artists of the same level.</p><p>His body and Saint power alone were already extremely powerful. With the fusion of the death law and the array Dao law, he exploded and broke through Mu Yang’s Void Ocean.</p><p>Mu Yang’s body trembled violently and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a bolt of lightning as he approached Mu yang and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Mu yang tried his best to block it, but it was useless. His arm collided with Lu Ming’s and was almost broken. The web between his thumb and forefinger was split and blood flowed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming struck out more than a hundred palms. Mu yang tried his best to block them. However, with each palm strike, the injury on his arm became more serious. After more than a hundred palms, Mu Yang’s hands exploded and blood and flesh flew everywhere..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
