Most importantly, they were disciples of a strong person in the yuan continent and had cultivated powerful domain techniques. Their combat power was unfathomable and they were probably no match for them.</p><p>However, now that it concerned Lu Ming’s reputation, they had no choice but to fight.</p><p>“Let’s go out and fight!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan opened his mouth and then flew out of the window in a flash.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou was also there.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Li Ke’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he flew out as well.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The people in the restaurant also flew out one after another, wanting to watch the show.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go out too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded, and the two of them flew out of the restaurant.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were not Li Ke’s match.</p><p>Now, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s cultivation was at Lv 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Compared to back then, he was already many times stronger.</p><p>Originally, with their talent, it would have been difficult for them to reach this step. But now, the world had changed.</p><p>At the beginning of the world’s metamorphosis, before the yuan continent experts arrived, the Dragon Alliance was the ruler of the divine wilderness continent. They must have obtained many sacred herbs and spiritual roots.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s in-name disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou must have benefited greatly. It was not surprising that their cultivation had reached such a level.</p><p>However, Li Ke was even more powerful. His cultivation was already at the first stage of the half-Saint realm, so he was much stronger than the two of them.</p><p>In the sky, Zhuang Xiaoshan, Zhuang xiaorou, and Li Ke stood opposite each other.</p><p>The surroundings were filled with people.</p><p>When many people heard that one of them was Li Ke, one of the top ten prodigies, and the other was the disciple of Lu Ming, the former leader of the Dragon Alliance, they were immediately interested.</p><p>you two, come at me together. Let’s end this quickly. I still want to go and drink!</p><p>Li Ke said confidently.</p><p>“I’ll deal with you alone!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan stepped forward and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a press of the long spear, the earth domain spread out and crushed toward Li Ke.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Li Ke sneered. The sword in his hand burst into light and shot up into the sky.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan’s earth territory was directly split open by Li Ke’s sword light. Zhuang Xiaoshan’s figure retreated rapidly, but there was a sword wound on his chest, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan was injured in one move!</p><p>hahaha, you’re really trash. You can’t even block one move. This is Lu Ming’s disciple. I can tell from you that Lu Ming isn’t much. You guys even bragged about how powerful he is!</p><p>Li Ke laughed, his voice full of mockery.</p><p>don’t insult my master! I’m not as talented as my master!</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan shouted, his eyes red.</p><p>you’re still bragging. 1 said, you two can come at me together!</p><p>Li Ke looked at Zhuang xiaorou and said in disdain.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou stepped forward and stood next to Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides started fighting again. This time, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou fought together.</p><p>However, they were still no match for him. After a few moves, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were defeated and retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>hahaha, you’re really trash. You can’t even withstand a single blow. Even if your master were here, he wouldn’t be my opponent!</p><p>Li Ke laughed wildly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou shouted.</p><p>you’ve already been defeated, yet you still dare to be so arrogant. I’ll completely cripple the two of you today and turn you into true trash!</p><p>Li Ke’s eyes turned cold as he rushed toward Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou. His sword light burst forth with amazing power.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan roared as he swept his spear out with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>“Xiao Shan, Xiao Rou, your talents are still lacking!”</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming shook his head. Then, he took a step forward and a surge of energy gushed out and silently flowed into Zhuang Xiaoshan’s body.</p><p>Apart from Qiu Yue, no one else noticed this.</p><p>“Small tricks, break!”</p><p>Li Ke shouted arrogantly, and his sword light burst forth. He wanted to break Zhuang xiaorou’s spear momentum with one move and cripple Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the power of Zhuang Xiaoshan’s spear increased dramatically. The spear light was dazzling and turned into a thousand meters long, like a mountain range, pressing down on Li Ke.</p><p>Li Ke’s sword light was like a candle flame that was extinguished as soon as it appeared.</p><p>“How is this possible …? Ah!”</p><p>Li Ke shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Then, Zhuang xiaorou’s spear force pressed down, and Li Ke was smashed to the ground like a dead dog. He smashed a big hole in the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan himself was stunned. He suddenly felt a surge of power flowing into his body, making his power surge.</p><p>“Someone is helping me!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan immediately thought of this.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou was also dumbfounded.</p><p>How did Zhuang Xiaoshan suddenly become so awesome?</p><p>Around them, the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>Just now, Zhuang Xiaoshan was completely suppressed by Li Ke and couldn’t fight back. In the blink of an eye, Zhuang Xiaoshan seemed to have become a different person. He completely crushed Li Ke and injured him with one move.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>How could Zhuang Xiaoshan miss such an opportunity? he took a step forward, and a terrifying force crushed towards Li Ke.</p><p>Li Ke let out a long cry and used all his strength to resist.</p><p>However, Zhuang Xiaoshan was now supported by Lu Ming’s power. How could he resist him?</p><p>The powerful force was like an ancient divine mountain pressing down. Li Ke was like a Toad. His four limbs were on the ground and he kept twisting and turning, but it was useless. Under the pressure, he screamed and spat out large mouthfuls of blood. He couldn’t be more miserable.</p><p>“Who is it? Who is helping him? my master is a quasi-Emperor from the monarch race. Who are you? tell me your name!”</p><p>Li Ke shouted.</p><p>He was not stupid. He immediately thought that there must be a master who was helping Zhuang Xiaoshan in the dark. Otherwise, Zhuang Xiaoshan’s power could not have suddenly increased.</p><p>The surrounding spectators also came to a realization.</p><p>It was likely that someone was helping Zhuang Xiaoshan in secret.</p><p>who is it? if you have the ability, then come out. You won’t have a good end for going against my monarch race!</p><p>Li Ke shouted.</p><p>hehe, you are from the divine wilderness continent. When did you become a member of the sovereign race? perhaps you are just a dog of the sovereign race?”</p><p>A faint voice was heard and Lu Ming stepped out.</p><p>“You were the one who attacked?”</p><p>Li Ke glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, which was equivalent to a silent agreement.</p><p>you dare to go against the DI family? the DI family will not let you off!</p><p>Li Ke roared.</p><p>“Di family, 1 will go there sooner or later. Ask Di Shi Tian to wash his neck and wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his killing intent strong.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was too arrogant. He told sakra to wash his neck and wait.</p><p>What kind of person was sakra?</p><p>A Martial Emperor expert, a peerless expert from the yuan continent. This dark-skinned youth was too arrogant.</p><p>also, three months later, the two of them will challenge you in the Imperial Dragon City and defeat you with their own cultivation. So, 1 won’t kill you today. Get lost!</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming continued. With a thought, a wave of energy spread out. Li Ke screamed and his body flew out tens of thousands of meters. No one knew where he landed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
