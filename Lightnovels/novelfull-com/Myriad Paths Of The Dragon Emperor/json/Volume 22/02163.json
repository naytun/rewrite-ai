There were not many sacred herbs and spirit fruits that could be revived, so the strong practitioners of the yuan continent did not extend their reach here.</p><p>Yuan continent’s expert, Martial Emperor. Could it be sakra? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He suddenly thought of sakra.</p><p>Sakra was not in the yuan continent. It was very likely that he had received some news and came to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn’t the Dragon Alliance be controlled by sakra?</p><p>Then wouldn’t his parents, Xie Luan, and the others fall into the hands of sakra?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could not remain calm.</p><p>He wanted to rush back to the divine wilderness continent immediately.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming asked a few more questions before leaving with Qiu Yue, flying in the direction of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The two of them were very fast, and before long, they had flown out of the divine Ruins continent and into the endless sea.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming discovered that the world was different. The original energy was extremely rich, and some spiritual mountains and treasured lands were filled with spiritual herbs.</p><p>If this was the case for the divine Ruins continent, what would happen to the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>It would definitely be more shocking.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>In the ocean, the sea beasts churned, emitting a shocking aura.</p><p>ninth level martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming found a ferocious shark with a cultivation of Lv 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>The origin Qi in this Sea area was also extremely rich, causing the cultivation of the sea beasts in the sea to soar.</p><p>The two of them were moving at an astonishing speed as they approached the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The closer he got to the divine wilderness continent, the denser the yuan Qi became, and the more stable the space became.</p><p>Lu Ming had the illusion that he had returned to Yuan Lu.</p><p>Not long later, the two of them returned to the divine wilderness continent and landed from the Northern Plains.</p><p>“What a dense Heaven Earth Yuan Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were secretly shocked.</p><p>In the great land of Northern Plains, the origin Qi was extremely dense. The two of them felt that they were approaching ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>One had to know that Gu Yue Holy Land was one of the nine great Holy Lands of Yuan mountain. It was called a Holy Land, so one could imagine the cultivation environment.</p><p>But the divine wilderness mainland was approaching the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>The two of them used the divine breath technique to change their appearance and aura.</p><p>Sakra was likely to be in the divine wilderness continent, and there were other people from the DI family. Lu Ming did not want to alert the enemy, so the best plan was to act in secret.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a dark-skinned young man while Qiu Yue transformed into an ordinary-looking woman.</p><p>The two of them slowed down and walked in the air, observing the changes in the various places.</p><p>On the ground, ancient trees towered into the sky, and many mountains were filled with spirit herbs. There were even Saint herbs growing.</p><p>Many demonic beasts roamed the mountains and forests, and their cultivation was very powerful.</p><p>With a casual sweep, he discovered many demonic beasts of the spiritual ocean, spirit embryo, and spiritual God realms. They practically formed groups.</p><p>There were also many martial Royal realm demonic beasts.</p><p>These demonic beasts fed on spirit herbs, and their cultivation levels skyrocketed.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Even Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>Then, the two of them flew to search for big cities and asked for information.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a large city and learned more details.</p><p>This world had started to change eight or nine years ago. As the Overlord of the divine wilderness continent, the Dragon Alliance had seized the opportunity to obtain large amounts of resources. The number of experts in the Dragon Alliance had increased dramatically, and the strong ones had become even stronger.</p><p>However, a few years ago, an expert from the yuan continent came.</p><p>Facing the experts of the yuan continent, the Dragon Alliance could not resist at all. They were suppressed and occupied.</p><p>There was more than one group of experts from the yuan continent. There were several groups that occupied various regions of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Now, the divine wilderness continent was the ruler of the yuan continent.</p><p>The experts of the Dragon Alliance were completely controlled by the experts of the yuan continent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart felt heavy.</p><p>At the same time, he also heard some other news.</p><p>Over the years, many people in the divine wilderness continent had many speculations about the changes in the world.</p><p>Some people said that the divine wilderness continent must have been a flourishing land in the distant past. This point could be inferred from the countless spiritual herbs that emerged from the depths of the earth.</p><p>In the distant past, the divine wilderness continent was definitely filled with spirit herbs and sacred herbs.</p><p>But later on, for some unknown reason, this world was sealed by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the nine dragon veins. That was why the divine wilderness continent was in a state of exhaustion.</p><p>Now that the passage had been reopened, the entire continent had recovered.</p><p>With a heavy heart, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue rushed to the central continent.</p><p>Along the way, they saw many people wandering in the vast mountains, looking for all kinds of spirit herbs and Saint herbs.</p><p>young master, many people are heading toward the mountain range!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Along the way, they noticed that many people were flying in one direction with burning eyes.</p><p>I’m afraid there’s an incredible treasure coming into being in that place. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued. Then, he and Qiu Yue flew in that direction.</p><p>Soon, they arrived in front of a desolate mountain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The roars of beasts could be heard from time to time in the mountains.</p><p>Monstrous beasts as large as mountains traversed and fought with human martial artists.</p><p>this mountain is really amazing. Sacred medicine is everywhere!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like the stars. He could see a vast territory. The entire mountain and the vast mountain range were reflected in his eyes as he stood high in the sky.</p><p>He found that this mountain range was rich in Origin Energy and spirit herbs and sacred herbs were everywhere. There were even more sacred herbs and sacred herbs than in ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think that the divine wilderness continent might have been very prosperous in the distant past. There were sacred medicine seeds deep underground that had not decayed throughout the ages. Now, they were rich in vital energy and had even taken root and sprouted.</p><p>Otherwise, no matter how rich the origin Qi was, it was impossible to grow so many spiritual and sacred medicines in less than ten years.</p><p>At the same time, countless demonic beasts lived on this vast mountain, and they were all very powerful.</p><p>“Young master, should we step on some sacred herbs too?”</p><p>Qiu Yue asked.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Although Lu Ming had a lot of resources on hand, no one would mind having too many sacred elixirs. Although they had no use for these sacred elixirs, his parents and others would definitely need them in the future.</p><p>The two of them rushed into the forest and saw a ginseng as thick as an arm. It was golden in color and had a fragrant smell.</p><p>This was a sacred medicine, and it was effective even for martial Saints.</p><p>However, this ginseng was guarded by a demonic beast.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A giant wolf with the strength of a second level martial Royal realm pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a burst of energy shot out, killing the giant wolf. He then kept the Golden ginseng.</p><p>After that, Qiu Yue and Lu Ming went around the forest to collect the sacred medicine.</p><p>They couldn’t even be bothered to harvest ordinary spirit herbs.</p><p>In a Valley, Lu Ming casually killed a first level Martial Emperor realm giant snake and plucked a sacred medicine.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. During this period of time, it would be strange if the cultivation of the divine wilderness continent’s people did not skyrocket, as there were too many sacred elixirs.</p><p>If a martial Royal realm expert ate the Saint herb to cultivate, his cultivation would definitely improve rapidly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
