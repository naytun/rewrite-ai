He looked Holy and unparalleled.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his understanding of the Laws of Chaos was deepening.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body suddenly exploded and rose. The Laws of Chaos whistled and filled Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>With a single thought, the chaos laws between heaven and earth were easily controlled by Lu Ming, forming the shape of a large river that circled around him.</p><p>River of laws!</p><p>The Laws of Chaos had finally broken through the shackles and reached the perfect stage, forming the shape of a river.</p><p>Laws forming a River did not mean that laws would really become a River. They were laws at perfection. With a thought, they would condense together like a river.</p><p>Then, the chaos laws continued to pour into Lu Ming’s body, helping him to temper his body and Saint energy.</p><p>The previous time, he had perfected the array Dao laws. Lu Ming already had the experience and this time, he was familiar with the process.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming’s aura had completely stabilized.</p><p>my strength and Saint energy have both increased by a large amount!</p><p>Lu Ming carefully sensed the changes in his body and revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The strongest law formed a River. To become an Emperor-to-be, the tempering of the body and Saint power was much stronger than the king path law.</p><p>The last time he had a breakthrough in the array Dao laws, his physical body and Saint power had improved, but this time, they had improved even more.</p><p>The Saint heart in his dantian was crystal clear and filled with endless Saint power. As the Saint heart rotated, endless Saint power poured into his meridians like a river.</p><p>There was a faint glow circulating in Lu Ming’s body, which was filled with infinite power.</p><p>Strong! He was too strong!</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>1’11 start comprehending the death and devour laws now!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>If the law of death and the law of devouring were both perfected, how strong would his body and Saint power be?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation and he began to comprehend.</p><p>The comprehension of nomological laws in this world was indeed unique and much faster than outside.</p><p>Not only that, but this piece of heaven and earth was a corner left behind when the primordial realm first opened. It was also very helpful in developing a small world.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had yet to reach the stage of breaking through to the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time. As Lu Ming focused on cultivation, time flew by.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another half a year had passed.</p><p>In half a year’s time, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated the death rule and the devour rule to 99%.</p><p>This speed was already shockingly fast. In the outside world, it would definitely not be possible without five years.</p><p>However, after it was raised to 99%, it would be difficult to cultivate it to perfection in one go. It would take time to accumulate.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming began to think. He wanted to cultivate other laws.</p><p>“What laws should I cultivate?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered carefully.</p><p>After all, he could cultivate many types of nomological laws. The nomological laws could merge with each other and greatly increase his strength.</p><p>Furthermore, comprehending nomological laws in this world was too fast. He did not want to miss it.</p><p>He was studying other laws.</p><p>Extreme limit law!</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming decided to cultivate the ultimate law.</p><p>The laws of extremity and extreme power allowed each of his attacks to contain terrifying power.</p><p>Furthermore, Long Chen and desolate power both cultivated the laws of extremity. Lu Ming had sparred with Long Chen and desolate power many times, so he had a better understanding of the laws of extremity. It would be easier for him to comprehend them.</p><p>Furthermore, as more of his laws reached perfection, Lu Ming’s physical body and Saint energy would become stronger. In addition, the Laws of Chaos would be as heavy as a mountain. His attacks would become more and more powerful.</p><p>With the addition of the extreme rule, his attack would be even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming put his thoughts into action and began to seriously comprehend the ultimate law.</p><p>This world was indeed different. In just a few days, Lu Ming had a feeling. He felt that he had touched the door and he was more serious in comprehending it.</p><p>More than ten days later, Lu Ming had really crossed the threshold. He had comprehended the law of extremity. When he threw a punch, it carried extreme power and was shockingly powerful.</p><p>From then on, he began to comprehend the death law, the devour law, and the extremity law at the same time. He would take turns to comprehend each law for a few days.</p><p>Another three months passed, and the law of devouring was finally perfected. The law turned into a River, and Lu Ming’s physical body and holy power were greatly enhanced.</p><p>Three months after the breakthrough of the engulfing rule, Lu Ming had been here for more than a year. He had also made a breakthrough in the death rule. The rule formed a River and achieved perfection.</p><p>His body and Saint power were refined again.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could feel his holy power surging and it was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>His body was filled with explosive power.</p><p>He felt that he could blow up a one-star Martial Emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>This wasn’t an illusion. He was really too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how his combat strength was now.</p><p>Four types of laws had been perfected and formed a River. Two types of Supreme laws and two types of King path laws had tempered his body and Saint power four times.</p><p>The power of the fusion of four laws at perfection was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had also cultivated the extremity law to an extremely profound level. He was not far from forming a River of laws.</p><p>When Lu Ming entered this place, he had achieved a breakthrough in his ultimate limit law in one year and three people. He had attained perfection and his combat strength had soared once again.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the chaos Divine palm and maneuvered. The five types of nomological laws fused and the world rumbled and exploded like a big bell and drum. It was about to explode.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming stopped and heaved a long sigh. His eyes were shining.</p><p>The pressure in this area was extremely huge, but Lu Ming’s physical strength was too strong. He felt that he did not need Saint energy. He could withstand it with his physical body and travel far.</p><p>An ordinary person would definitely not be able to do this.</p><p>“Nomological laws at perfection don’t seem to be truly at perfection!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming considered the problem of the law.</p><p>He had comprehended five nomological laws in a row and had a deep feeling. He realized that the so-called perfection of his nomological laws was only the perfection of a certain stage. It was not the end. He could still continue to break through.</p><p>In reality, he had heard uncle Kong mention before that laws were the foundation of the world. They were extremely profound and far from simple. The so-called perfection of an Emperor-to-be was only the perfection of the first stage.</p><p>The comprehension of laws was divided into several stages.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to break through. It was difficult for an ordinary void Emperor to break through.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only thought about it casually and did not give it much thought. He was still some distance away from breaking through to the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>I’ve been here for a year and three months. There’s not much time left. i won’t comprehend other laws for the time being. i’ll just consolidate the five types of laws I have now and reach the stage where I can break through to the martial Supreme realm as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming set the cultivation direction and continued to cultivate..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
