The cracks on his Saint heart disappeared and finally recovered completely.</p><p>His physical body had also completely recovered, and his injuries were completely healed.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that it was all thanks to the celestial Thearch’s help. The energy contained endless vitality, which was why he could recover so quickly.</p><p>Otherwise, his Saint heart would have cracked and he would have been severely injured. It would have taken him a long time to recover.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and thanked Celestial Emperor Kong Yin solemnly.</p><p>What kind of person was the heavenly Emperor realm? yet, he could help him to break through his cultivation. Regardless of whether he succeeded or not, Lu Ming was very grateful.</p><p>“Sigh, what a pity!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin sighed. It was a pity that a person like Lu Ming could not become a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t force a breakthrough in the future. 1 can save you this time, but no one will be able to save you next time. Take care of yourself!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin said before turning around and returning to his chariot.</p><p>master, Xiangxiang Bella believes that you will definitely break through in the future and create a miracle!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang walked over and looked at Lu Ming with tears in her eyes.</p><p>“I also believe in master!” Ouyang Moli also walked over.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue also walked over, but she didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Then, Huang Ling, Long Chen, Luo Tianyi, Luo Xiang, and the others also came over.</p><p>Looking at these disciples and friends, Lu Ming’s heart warmed. He smiled and said,”Don’t worry, I won’t take any risks!”</p><p>At that moment, the Heng family, the he family, and the other forces who had a grudge against Lu Ming were overjoyed. They laughed in their hearts and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Mu yang was actually killed by a cripple. Hmph, the MU family will definitely take revenge!”</p><p>The MU family expert sneered in his heart as killing intent flickered in his eyes.</p><p>“Alright, it’s getting late. The top 320 heaven’s favorites, follow me to the heaven realm!” He said.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin’s voice was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, one figure after another flashed. One by one, the young heaven’s favorites flew up to the chariot.</p><p>“No, Xiangxiang doesn’t want to go to the heaven realm. Xiangxiang wants to stay with master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shook her head.</p><p>“Young master, I’m not going either!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>bubbles isn’t going either. I want to accompany brother Lu Ming!</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s neck and swayed.</p><p>Previously, heavenly Emperor Kong Yin had said that if Lu Ming could not become a heavenly Emperor, he could not go to the heaven realm.</p><p>The heaven realm would not waste resources on a person who was destined not to become a saint Emperor.</p><p>what are you talking about? go to the heaven realm and cultivate. You can only improve faster in the heaven realm!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Qiu Yue and the rest.</p><p>If the heaven realm wanted to train this group of young talents, they would definitely provide a lot of resources. With the guidance of the heavenly Emperor, their progress would definitely be very fast.</p><p>If he had stayed in the primordial realm and relied on his own exploration, his cultivation speed would have been much slower.</p><p>They did not know when the alien races would invade and when a Great War would break out. The only way was to go to the heaven realm to cultivate. Lu Ming would not let them stay.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Qiu Yue, bubbles, Lu Xiangxiang, and the rest shook their heads.</p><p>At this moment, heavenly Emperor Kong Yin’s gaze turned to bubbles, little guy, you’re a space-time spirit mouse. You’ll only be wasting your talent if you stay in the primordial realm and explore by yourself. Come with me to the heaven realm. There will be a special Celestial Emperor to guide you!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin placed great importance on bubbles!</p><p>The top ten warbeasts were no small matter. Each of them had unparalleled talent. If they were to fully mature, they would be peak experts.</p><p>The top ten Battle Beasts of the ancient era were all terrifying existences with unparalleled battle strength and unparalleled divine might.</p><p>“I’m not going!”</p><p>Pao Pao shook her head like a rattle.</p><p>Many people were green with envy. Bubble did not go despite the good conditions. It was infuriating.</p><p>“All of you, go to the heaven realm to cultivate together!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s face darkened. His sharp gaze swept across bubbles, Lu Xiangxiang, and the rest.’Tm not crippled, so I don’t need you to accompany me. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely become an Emperor in the future, and 1’11 go to the heaven realm to find you!”</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang muttered.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a serious tone.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the rest nodded.</p><p>Bubbles pouted unwillingly as well, looking reluctant to leave. Then, she lay on Lu Xiangxiang’s shoulder weakly and came to the front of the war chariot.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care!”</p><p>Huang Ling, desolate li, and the others also came to the chariot.</p><p>Lu Ming, when you return to the divine wilderness and see nianlin, help me pass on a message. When my cultivation level is high, 1 will definitely go and find her!</p><p>Long Chen said to Lu Ming.</p><p>He also wanted to stay behind and return to the divine wilderness to reunite with Xie nianlin.</p><p>However, he understood that the Great War was not far away. Without cultivation, even if they were temporarily reunited, so what? they could not protect anything in the future.</p><p>He wanted to go to the heaven realm to cultivate. He couldn’t miss this opportunity.</p><p>don’t worry, I will be returning to the divine wilderness soon. I will pass on the message for you. Take care!</p><p>Lu Ming patted Long Chen’s shoulder and smiled.</p><p>Everyone bade farewell to Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>Qiu Yue was the only one who did not move.</p><p>“Qiuyue, go!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu Yue.</p><p>“No, I’m not going. I want to stay by young master’s side!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shook her head. Before Lu Ming could say anything, Qiu Yue continued, even if young master chases me away, 1 will not leave. I want to stay by young master’s side. 1 still want to return to the divine wilderness continent to see old master and Madam!</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at Lu Ming with determination.</p><p>“Alright then!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming sighed and let Qiu Yue stay.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to take care. I’m going to the heaven realm too!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure came to Lu Ming’s side. It was Emperor formless.</p><p>“Director…”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. Could it be that the Emperor of notionless was going to the heaven realm to participate in the war?</p><p>“Huntian and tianhuo have entered the heaven realm. I don’t know if they’re Dead or Alive. I’m worried!”</p><p>Emperor formless explained. Lu Ming understood that Emperor formless was going to look for huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor.</p><p>“Principal, take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I hope that the next time 1 see you, you’ll have already become an Emperor!”</p><p>Wu Xiang smiled and then left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope you can become a saint Emperor. When the twenty years are up, I’ll challenge you. If you don’t become a saint Emperor, everything will be meaningless!”</p><p>In the end, the death blade came to Lu Ming’s side, left him with a few words, and turned to leave.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin spoke, and the nine true dragons roared, shaking the heavens.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The nine Dragons pulled the carriage toward the huge door in the depths of the sky. They rushed into the door and disappeared.</p><p>The other proud Children of Heaven of the primordial realm also entered the gate and disappeared.</p><p>Before Yuan Xin stepped through the door, she cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and turned to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw Luo cangqiong in the crowd. He was also one of the 320 people, and he also cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope you’re still alive. I’ll definitely kill you the next time I see you!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong sneered, turned around, and stepped into the gate.</p><p>“Master, take care…”</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care …”</p><p>The voices of Lu Xiangxiang, bubbles, and Feng Ling could be heard from the door.</p><p>The voice came, but the person had already disappeared.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, tens of thousands of rays of light flashed, and then the door disappeared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
