It turned out that he was waiting for the experts of evil spirit and the DI family to gather and then wipe them out.</p><p>This idea was too crazy!</p><p>“Ming ’er, did you invite any other experts, such as other martial Supremes?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master asked.</p><p>“There’s no one else, just us!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The scene was silent, and many people were stunned.</p><p>hero Lu Ming, it s not that I’m looking down on you, but evil spirit has at least two Guardian Kings. Moreover, Di Shi Tian, the patriarch of the DI family, is a terrifying martial sovereign. If we go, it’ll be like hitting a rock with an egg!</p><p>that’s right. Our current plan is to gather together, break out of the three prefectures, and head to other prefectures!</p><p>A few elders spoke. They were the Grand elders of a few sects and had absolute Saint realm cultivation.</p><p>I’m doing this because Pm confident. Why would I joke around with my life? besides, my master and senior brothers are all together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved. That was indeed the case!</p><p>Lu Ming was such a proud Son of Heaven. How could he be so reckless and throw his life away knowing that he was no match?</p><p>Did Lu Ming still have any trump cards?</p><p>“Alright, Ming ‘er, 1 will go to the DI family with you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was the first to express his stance.</p><p>“I’ll join you too!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain, yang tianzong also spoke.</p><p>“I’ll join you too!”</p><p>Following that, the ferocious Tiger of the demon Castle also spoke.</p><p>Then, many more people agreed to go with Lu Ming to the DI family.</p><p>However, there was a group of people who didn’t speak.</p><p>“What about you guys? what are you going to do if you don’t go and fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming s gaze shifted to those who were silent.</p><p>“I… We’re planning to enter the cloud Sea Mountain range and head to the other continents!”</p><p>An old man with an aquiline nose said.</p><p>This hook-nosed elder was a Grand Elder of the jiuxiao sword sect, and he was also an absolute Saint.</p><p>Oh, that’s good. If you don’t go, and I destroy the DI family and evil spirit cult, you won’t have a share in the three prefectures!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose and the others “faces changed slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming s meaning was clear. If evil spirit cult and di family were exterminated, those who did not participate in the battle would not have the right to stay in the three prefectures.</p><p>Those who didn’t want to go all had gloomy expressions.</p><p>alright, the idea is set. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and waved his hand. Three puppets appeared in the sky.</p><p>One of them was the goshawk puppet that Lu Ming often used. The other two were also flying puppets that Lu Ming had bought when he was at the shenxiao sect. Their speed was not any slower than the goshawk puppet.</p><p>The three puppets rapidly grew in size. Their wingspan was over a thousand meters long, and they filled the sky like three small mountains.</p><p>“Master, all of you can come up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Those who were willing to follow Lu Ming to the DI family all flew up to the puppet.</p><p>A layer of light emanated from the puppets and enveloped everyone. Then, with a thought from Lu Ming, the three puppets broke through the air and disappeared, leaving no trace behind in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The rest of the people were tongue-tied.</p><p>“Brother Wang, what are your plans next?”</p><p>Someone asked the old man from jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>Hmph, that Lu Ming is overestimating himself. The strength of evil spirit cult and di family is definitely beyond our imagination. If they go, they’ll only die!</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose sneered.</p><p>but 1 think Lu Ming is full of confidence. Perhaps he has some trump cards. This person is a peerless genius. He might have some trump cards!</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose s eyes flickered as he thought of all the possibilities.</p><p>how about this? we’ll go to the DI family and observe in the dark. If Lu Ming is defeated and killed, well escape to the cloud Sea Mountain from the Emperor province and go somewhere else. If Lu Ming defeats the DI family and rhe evil spirit cult, well take the opportunity to take action and get some benefits!</p><p>The old man with the aquiline nose said.</p><p>“Brother Wang is wise!”</p><p>“Senior Wang is wise!”</p><p>The others started to flatter him. Immediately, they also started moving towards the DI family.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the three puppets at an astonishing speed. It did not take long for them to enter the Imperial state.</p><p>“What a fast speed!”</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>It hadn’t been long, bur they had already passed through the Azure continent and entered the Emperor continent. This speed was simply astonishing. Ordinary space-breaking flying shuttles couldn’t even compare to it.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming. This was the number one heaven’s pride of the Azure continent back then. He must have been extraordinary in these years.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>He was extremely satisfied with this disciple.</p><p>After a short while, a mountain peak appeared in front of them. On the mountain peak, there were many palaces.</p><p>The DI family had arrived!</p><p>“The DI family!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The DI family had naturally noticed Lu Ming’s arrival. Deafening bell rings were heard. Then, figures flickered in all the palaces.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>A voice rang out.</p><p>The people of rhe DI family and evil spirit were a little shocked.</p><p>They had never expected that Lu Ming would dare to take the initiative to attack. Initially, they were going to send out an Army two days later to annihilate Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would take the initiative to attack.</p><p>On the mountain in front of the DI family, a large number of figures appeared.</p><p>They were all experts from the Emperor family and evil spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the puppet. He stood in the air.</p><p>Among the crowd, he saw the sect master of the sky demon sect, the tianshen sect, and others.</p><p>“Young master, I’ll make the first move!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Okay, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and stepped into the air, heading towards the DI family. Her cultivation of the Martial Emperor realm burst out.</p><p>The vast Emperor pressure pressed towards the DI family like a raging wave.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically as they felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>At this moment, two terrifying auras burst out from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Two beams of light shot up into the sky and destroyed Qiu Yue’s aura.</p><p>The next moment, two figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>They were two old men. They were skinny like two mummies and were wrapped in black robes.</p><p>s p i rit – d e vo u r ing S h a ky a m uni!</p><p>Lu Ming s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen one of them before. It was Shaleyamuni spirit Devourer, who had been suppressed in one of the six Forbidden Lands of the Gang region, the gale plain.</p><p>When Shakyamuni spirit Devourer escaped, Lu Ming had obtained the Tai Chi formation disk there.</p><p>As for the other person, Lu Ming had never seen him before. He must be another Guardian King of evil spirit.</p><p>he he, you’re such a young martial Supreme. Your qi and blood must be very Strong. If 1 devour you, you might be able to help me break through my cultivation!</p><p>Shakyamuni let out a strange laugh and pounced toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue struck out with her palm, and the laws of yin and yang moved with the force of her palm, blasting toward Shakyamuni Shiling.</p><p>The palm force was like a tide, blocking Shakyamuni spirit-devouring’s body.</p><p>His body trembled violently, and he was forced to retreat..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
