The entire place was shocked and clamoring.</p><p>There were only a few Yuan continent experts present. Most of them were from the divine wilderness continent. Lu Ming’s status in the divine wilderness continent was too high.</p><p>More than ten years ago, Lu Ming had left the divine wilderness to cultivate in the yuan continent. Now that he had returned, he had indeed displayed shocking combat power.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, Yan kuangtu, and the rest saluted Lu Ming together.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>Following that, more and more people saluted Lu Ming.</p><p>When the Dragon Alliance had unified the world, there were countless members. There was a large group of Dragon Alliance members present. They were extremely excited to see Lu Ming.</p><p>senior Xie, senior Jiuyang, big brother Yan, Hua Chi, let’s have a drink and chat after we’ve dealt with these people from the yuan continent!</p><p>Lu Ming said and nodded at Xie Luan and the others.</p><p>These words made sakra and the others ‘faces turn cold, and their bodies were filled with a cold aura.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve cultivated in the yuan continent for a period of time and have made some progress. However, you’re still far from being able to go against me alone. You must have someone supporting you from behind. Call out the person behind you!</p><p>Sakra said coldly.</p><p>“I don’t need the help of others to deal with you all by myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Many people were stunned. How was it possible for Lu Ming to deal with sakra alone?</p><p>“I can easily suppress you with a flip of my hand!”</p><p>Sakra opened his mouth indifferently, and his aura became even colder.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Then, sakra took a step forward. This step caused the entire sky to rumble and explode. An incomparably terrifying pressure pressed down on the entire world.</p><p>His body emitted endless golden light, like an invincible Emperor looking down on the world.</p><p>The pressure came in waves. It was too terrifying. Many people with insufficient cultivation directly knelt down. It was difficult to resist.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>Many people roared and knelt down unwillingly, desperately resisting.</p><p>At this time, the master of the divine ox Palace and the manlong Hall Master released an aura that rippled out like water, relieving the pressure on the others.</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief and then looked frightened.</p><p>too strong, sakra is too strong. He’s completely unfathomable and unrivaled!</p><p>indeed. Just the overflowing Qi is enough to make me explode. How can there be such a powerful person in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming is finished. No matter how strong he is, he can’t be sakra’s match!</p><p>Many people were discussing. After feeling the aura overflowing from sakra Azia, many people were terrified of sakra Azia’s strength and thought that Lu Ming could not compete with sakra Azia at all.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was a prodigy, he had only cultivated for a few years. How could he possibly fight against such a person?</p><p>“How dare you, sakra, you dare to attack me!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s loud shout reverberated throughout the entire area, causing many people to be dumbfounded.</p><p>Sakra himself was also stunned.</p><p>Why did he not dare to attack Lu Ming?</p><p>At this moment, a token appeared in Lu Ming’s hand, shining with golden light.</p><p>“Sakra, why aren’t you paying your respects to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Hunyuan sect’s golden inheritance token! So you’re the Golden inheritor of Hunyuan sect!</p><p>Sakra Azia’s eyes burst out with a bright light.</p><p>“It’s good that you know!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at sakra indifferently, his face calm.</p><p>Back then, when he became the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor, he had obtained a name list. On the name list, there was sakra di, a bronze inheritor.</p><p>Be it the bronze or silver inheritors, they had all sworn to follow the orders of the gold inheritors.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Golden inheritance token and waited to see sakra’s reaction.</p><p>Sakra’s face changed, and then he laughed,” Lu Ming, you’re really funny. You actually want to use the Golden inheritor’s token to suppress me. Don’t you know that after reaching the Martial Emperor realm, you have the ability to go against oaths? ordinary blood oaths can’t do anything to me. Today, I’ll kill you and take the Golden inheritor’s token!</p><p>Sakra Azia laughed, full of ridicule.</p><p>these people really don’t know how to keep the oath they made back then!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and kept the Golden inheritance token.</p><p>He had never thought of using the inheritance token to make sakra submit.</p><p>He had only wanted to verify it earlier.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Sakra took another step forward, and the terrifying pressure became even stronger.</p><p>Hua Chi, Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the others all looked nervous.</p><p>Fatty, Zhuang xiaorou, Zhuang Xiaoshan, and the others also looked nervous.</p><p>Although they believed in Lu Ming, the other party was too powerful. He was really too powerful. It was beyond their imagination.</p><p>“Alliance master is very calm. He should be confident!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Based on their understanding of Lu Ming, they knew that he would not fight a battle that he was not confident of winning. He must have something to rely on to be so calm.</p><p>clan master di, leave this kid to me. I can feel that this kid’s hands are stained with the blood of my clan!</p><p>At this moment, an unusually burly figure stepped out from behind sakra.</p><p>This person was covered in heavy iron armor and was four meters tall.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that this was an evil god.</p><p>Although the aura that this evil god tribe member exuded was not as strong as sakra Azia, it was still extremely terrifying. He was a one-star void Emperor.</p><p>Sakra stopped in his tracks. Since someone was doing it for him, he was too lazy to do it.</p><p>“Brat, your hands are stained with the blood of my clan. Die!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s expert held a Mace in his hand and swept it out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space exploded and the mace was swung at Lu Ming with a terrifying force.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The present was different from the past. Right now, the divine wilderness continent’s space was extremely stable. Everyone’s flying speed was many times slower, much less breaking through space.</p><p>But now, the evil god tribe’s Mace had swept out, causing the space to explode. It was clear how powerful this attack was.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were in their throats, worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He reached out with a claw and grabbed outwards.</p><p>A huge hand formed and grabbed the mace.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The mace hit the hand, but the hand didn’t move at all. It grabbed the mace and shook it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mace shook violently, and a terrifying force was sent out.</p><p>The evil god race member screamed out in pain as the thick armor on his body exploded. His arm also exploded, causing blood and flesh to splatter everywhere.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He then shook his hand and the huge Mace flew back, hitting the evil god tribe member.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The evil god tribe member’s entire body was like a huge watermelon that exploded. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere, and his soul was scattered.</p><p>A one-star illusionary Emperor from the evil god tribe was killed by Lu Ming in seconds.</p><p>The entire place quieted down. This scene shocked everyone.</p><p>Earlier on, the aura that the evil god tribe’s expert had revealed was not weak. Although it was not comparable to Di Shi Tian’s, it was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>To the people of the divine wilderness continent, they were unfathomable and unrivaled existences.</p><p>However, such an existence was killed by Lu Ming in one move..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
