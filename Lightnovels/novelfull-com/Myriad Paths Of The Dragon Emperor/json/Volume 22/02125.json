His extremely powerful physical strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>an immemorial body cultivator. I’d like to see how abnormal your physical body is!</p><p>Lu Ming did not Dodge at all. He burst out with three types of laws and cast the chaos Divine palm, blasting it out.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The palm and the fist collided with a deafening howl. The space where the two fists met was like a wave, shaking.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bao de’s bodies trembled at the same time and they retreated a few steps.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>Tyrannical virtue relied purely on the strength of the physical body. It was powerful and terrifying. That punch caused Lu Ming’s three types of laws to shake and they were almost pierced through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had refined three wisps of chaos Qi and was tempered by the river formed by five types of laws. It was already extremely powerful. However, it was still far from being comparable to Bao de.</p><p>It was said that in the heaven realm’s immemorial era, there were great ancient body cultivators who had invincible physical bodies. They could cross the universe and stand on the ground. They could destroy the stars in the sky with a single punch. They were incredibly powerful.</p><p>When one’s physical body was cultivated to the extreme, it would be indestructible and immortal, existing with the heavens and earth.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Bao de roared and charged at Lu Ming like a wild beast. His muscles swelled and his body expanded again.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Three types of laws revolved around him, and the power of his physical body and holy power exploded to the extreme as he fought Bao de. Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The two of them were like two wild beasts, constantly colliding with each other on the fighting ring.</p><p>There was no technique, it was purely a head-on fight.</p><p>Bao de was an immemorial body cultivator. His physical body was indestructible. Even an ordinary sovereign weapon would be blown apart by Bao de’s punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was also very strong, and his holy power was condensed and thick.</p><p>Most importantly, the law of chaos was as heavy as a mountain and could suppress the world. Under the blessing of the law of chaos, Lu Ming had infinite strength.</p><p>The two of them had similar styles. They kept colliding with each other, making the fighting ring rumble.</p><p>If this was a battle outside, it would definitely be a scene of mountains collapsing and the earth cracking.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Seeing the two of them fighting, many people’s faces turned pale. It was too fierce. Under such power, any technique was unnecessary. Even some ultimate maxims would be torn apart.</p><p>Even a two-star illusionary Emperor would be easily blown up.</p><p>The two of them fought for over a hundred rounds.</p><p>“Satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. After an intense battle, he was becoming more and more familiar with the use of the laws, especially the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos formed a River. For the current stage, it was already perfect.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that he had yet to reach the end of the law. There was still a path ahead, but it was blocked by the fog and he could not see clearly. Now, the fog had finally dispersed a little.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that if the law could be improved, its power would increase by leaps and bounds.</p><p>haha, 1 finally met a decent one. This is great!</p><p>Bao de also laughed, and his attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had fought another hundred rounds.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming became more and more courageous as the battle progressed. He finally began to gain the upper hand and suppressed Bao de until he started to defend himself.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the end, Bao de began to retreat. With every step he took, the fighting ring would rumble violently.</p><p>“Stop, stop fighting, stop fighting!”</p><p>At this time, Bao de suddenly shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his hands and retreated.</p><p>Bao de gasped for breath, his whole body drenched in sweat, and it took him a long time to recover.</p><p>you pervert! I’ll admit defeat today. Let’s fight another day!</p><p>Bao de said.</p><p>“Alright, sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was good for him to have a strong opponent to fight with.</p><p>Bao de jumped and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had won!</p><p>Many people widened their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Bao de. In this case, he would definitely be in the top three.</p><p>This was beyond the expectations of many people. Previously, they thought that it would be good enough if Lu Ming could enter the seventh place.</p><p>“Now, the rankings can almost be seen!”</p><p>Many people began to deduce the ranking based on the previous battle results.</p><p>Everyone felt that the first and second place should be between Tianming and Yuan Xin. Lu Ming would be third, Bao de would be fourth, and bubbles would be fifth.</p><p>This was probably the situation for the top five.</p><p>Now, everyone was looking forward to the main event, and that was the Battle of Destiny against Yuan Xin.</p><p>As long as the two of them were able to determine the winner, the top ten rankings would basically be set.</p><p>Hmph, you’ve underestimated my master. Who knows, maybe my master can defeat Yuan Xin and Tian Ming!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang pouted in displeasure when she heard that the people around her thought that Lu Ming could only be ranked third.</p><p>“Hehe, little girl, you’re really blindly confident. Your master is strong, but it’s impossible for him to compete with Tianming and yuanxin. He’s definitely no match for them!”</p><p>we can understand the little girl’s feelings of trusting her master, but you have to see the reality!</p><p>A few white-haired old men ‘kindly’ reminded Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>Hmph, your judgment is never accurate. You even said that my master could only get the seventh place!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang pouted.</p><p>“This … We were wrong before, but this time, we’re definitely not wrong!”</p><p>The few elders were certain.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang pouted and ignored the elders.</p><p>The competition continued as bubbles fought against destiny. Bubbles admitted defeat immediately. According to him, he was too lazy to compete since he couldn’t win anyway.</p><p>After that, ao ke defeated Yun Haoge, Yuan Xin defeated Wu Liang, and ancient devil defeated Xing He.</p><p>With that, Galaxy was already in last place, not even as good as ancient devil.</p><p>In short, other than Lu Ming’s unexpected defeat of Bao de, the rest of the battles were within everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The sixth round ended, and the seventh round began.</p><p>“The heavenly mandate is against Yuan Xin!”</p><p>The white-haired elder said.</p><p>As soon as the voice came out, the scene fell silent, then burst into an uproar.</p><p>The main show was here, the biggest main show was here.</p><p>Tianming versus Yuan Xin!</p><p>This seemed to have been deliberately arranged by the white-haired elder. In the previous rounds, Lu Ming would fight in the first match. Now, the first match of the seventh round was between Tianming and Yuan Xin.</p><p>The atmosphere was ignited.</p><p>Countless people revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>In everyone’s eyes, this was a battle between the champion and the runner-up, a battle between the two strongest geniuses of the primordial realm.</p><p>Tianming and Yuan Xin also emitted a strong fighting will, and their eyes met in the air.</p><p>Although both of them came from the divine land and were known as the peerless duo of the divine land, they had never fought before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>He felt that in the previous battles, neither Tianming nor Yuan Xin had used their full strength. In this battle, he would be able to see how strong they were.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the two of them rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying auras collided in the air, causing a violent boom.</p><p>Just the collision of auras formed a gust of wind that swept across the fighting ring..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
