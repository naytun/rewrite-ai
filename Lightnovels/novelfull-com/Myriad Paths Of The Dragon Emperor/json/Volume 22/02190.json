At the same time, he emitted a Scarlet light. Even his palm was the same.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>LAN Yun threw more than ten punches at Lu Ming in succession. As he swung his fists, a violent lion’s roar was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that on each of LAN Yun’s fists, there was a fiery red Lion roaring. As LAN Yun swung his fist, the fiery red Lions also pounced.</p><p>This was a terrifying magical technique that unleashed the power of the two laws that LAN Yun controlled.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and seven types of laws burst out. He struck more than ten times in an instant.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fist and palm collided continuously, causing a shocking boom and a powerful force to sweep out.</p><p>However, this place had experienced a great battle between peerless powerhouses countless years ago and the ground had become extremely hard. The force of Lu Ming and LAN Yun’s battle could only leave a shallow mark on the ground.</p><p>The two of them attacked at an astonishing speed, and the sky was filled with fist and palm shadows. In an instant, they had exchanged hundreds of moves, and the lion’s roar was endless.</p><p>damn it, this guy is even stronger than the legends say. Didn’t the legends say that he only mastered five laws? ”</p><p>LAN Yun roared in his heart.</p><p>After exchanging hundreds of moves, he still could not defeat Lu Ming. This made him a little impatient.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. This LAN Yun was indeed not weaker than the gray-robed young man back then. However, Lu Ming was also much stronger than he was during the ten lands battle.</p><p>During the battle of the ten lands, Lu Ming had to borrow the power of the third bloodline to fight against the gray-robed young man. However, he did not need the power of the third bloodline to fight against him now.</p><p>The two continued to exchange hundreds of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Tear him apart!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed. The fiery red glow around his body grew even more intense. He waved his hands and the fiery red Lions in his hands combined into one, turning into a huge Red Lion that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this move was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>This was LAN Yun’s ultimate killing move, his trump card ultimate move, its power shocking.</p><p>chaos hammer!</p><p>Lu Ming used the divine ability that he had created, the chaos hammer.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had not stopped exploring the hammer of chaos and the sword of death. The power of these two supernatural powers was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>In particular, Lu Ming had also integrated the laws of alchemy and the laws of equipment.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos and the other five King path laws combined together and exploded at the same time. Their power burst out.</p><p>An enormous hammer formed and smashed towards LAN Yun.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The hammer of chaos and the huge Red Lion collided. The space kept exploding, and the terrifying energy swept in all directions.</p><p>The two of them were locked in a stalemate in the air, constantly fighting against each other. In the end, the Red Lion and the hammer of chaos exploded at the same time.</p><p>The two of them trembled and retreated.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>LAN Yun roared in his heart. He was shocked and furious that he could not take down Lu Ming despite his abilities.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He roared loudly, and an even more intense red light spread out from his body. The space between his brows lit up, and a large seal was about to appear.</p><p>Just as a section of the seal emerged, a shocking lion’s roar rang out, causing the void to constantly explode. Its power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He could sense that this was a terrifying Emperor weapon, or at least a true Emperor weapon.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming’s third bloodline emerged. He had borrowed a portion of the third bloodline’s power to greatly increase his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed toward the blue cloud like a bolt of lightning. He struck with the hammer of chaos.</p><p>LAN Yun did not expect that Lu Ming’s abilities would suddenly increase sharply. In a hurry, he hurriedly blocked it but how could he block it?</p><p>After being struck by the primal Chaos hammer, LAN Yun was sent flying with a blood-curdling screech and vomited a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very decisive in his actions. After injuring LAN Yun with one move, he immediately charged over to kill LAN Yun.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you sooner or later!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared and spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, a fiery red jade token appeared in his hand and he crushed it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the Jade token was crushed, a huge fiery-red Lion appeared. This Lion had a pair of wings. It grabbed LAN Yun and flapped its wings. Its body soared into the sky and flew into the distance at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming chased closely but after a while, he realized that he could not catch up to the other party. The other party flew further and further away and finally disappeared from his field of vision.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>This LAN Yun was definitely a disciple of a major force in the heaven realm. He had many treasures on him, and that Jade tablet was used to save his life.</p><p>Lu Ming went back and kept LAN Songshi’s storage ring. Then, his figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming carefully shuttled through the area alone.</p><p>After a few more times, he encountered two marks.</p><p>Among them, there were alien races and heaven realm experts.</p><p>Other than that, he gained nothing.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming could not tell the direction in this battlefield. He did not know which side was the exit and how to get out. He could only walk around randomly.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He heard a voice coming from the front.</p><p>Other than the sound of the wind, there was no other sound on this piece of land. But now, there were other noises. This meant that there was something up ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately cast the divine breath technique and restrained his aura to the extreme. Then, he landed on the ground and walked along the ground.</p><p>A hundred miles later, Lu Ming was hiding on a low mountain peak. He looked ahead with the help of the rocks.</p><p>In front of them, there was a flat piece of land, and there were many burly figures.</p><p>“Evil god tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>There were more than ten evil god tribes in total. However, there were certain differences between these evil god tribes and the ones that Lu Ming had seen before.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s members were covered in scales as well. However, the evil god tribe’s scales that Lu Ming had encountered in the past were all black. On the other hand, the scales of these evil god tribe’s members were purple.</p><p>Furthermore, they were smaller in size compared to the evil god tribe that he had encountered before. However, they were indeed from the evil god tribe. Every single one of them had a third eye in the middle of their brows.</p><p>Over a dozen purple-scaled evil god tribe members surrounded an area. Their figures flashed continuously, as if they were setting up something.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the area again and realized that it was a skeleton that was surrounded by more than ten evil god tribe members.</p><p>This skeleton held a large bow in its hand. It was obvious that the people from the evil god tribe were here for this large bow, but they didn’t dare to get too close.</p><p>“These guys seem to be setting up some kind of formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming observed carefully and realized that the evil god tribe members should be setting up an array.</p><p>After a moment, the evil god tribe members stopped and retreated.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>One of the evil god tribesmen let out a low grunt, and a purple light emanated from the bodies of the dozen or so evil god tribesmen before they sank into the ground.</p><p>The ground glowed, and black rays of light flashed out.</p><p>Then, these black rays of light actually condensed into large words.</p><p>Lu Ming did not recognize these chess pieces. They were very ancient..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
