He turned around and tried to escape from the stone platform.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not let him have his way!</p><p>He must kill Mu yang!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and caught up with Mu yang in an instant. He struck Mu Yang’s back with his palm. Mu yang screamed in pain as his body was pierced through, leaving a large hole in his back.</p><p>At this moment, both his arms were crippled and his body was pierced through. His combat strength was greatly reduced and he was even less able to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming leaped up and kicked Mu Yang’s face. Mu Yang’s body landed heavily on the stone platform, causing it to rumble. A series of cracking sounds came from his body and dozens of his bones were broken.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped on Mu Yang’s face, rendering him unable to move.</p><p>This was very similar to the first time Muyang challenged Lu Ming. He was also stepped on by Lu Ming and lost all his face.</p><p>“All! Tianyun, i’ll kill you! i’ll make sure you die without a proper burial!”</p><p>Mu yang roared crazily. He was truly crazy.</p><p>Before the battle, he was still acting all high and mighty, wanting Lu Ming to die miserably. He even mocked Lu Ming for being a good-for-nothing with no potential and that he would never be a match for him if he could not break through to the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>But how many moves had it been since the battle started? He was like a wild dog being stepped on by Lu Ming. This kind of humiliation made him go crazy.</p><p>“You still dare to threaten me in this situation!”</p><p>Lu Ming was indifferent. With a wave of his hand, two beams of light struck Mu Yang’s legs, causing them to explode.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Mu yang screamed hysterically.</p><p>With his current cultivation, even if he only had a head left, he could regrow his flesh and recover his body.</p><p>However, the pain was real.</p><p>Now, his four limbs were crippled and his body had been pierced through. He was severely injured and in extreme pain.</p><p>“Tianyun, you dare to kill me? The experts of my mu clan are right here. If you dare to kill me, you’ll have to face the revenge of my mu clan!”</p><p>Mu yang roared. He was certain that Lu Ming would not dare to kill him.</p><p>He glared at Lu Ming viciously. As long as he did not die, he would definitely kill Lu Ming in the future, no matter what.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold. He stomped on Muyang’s head and it burst like a watermelon. Then, a soul flew out and was held in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>This was Mu Yang’s soul. At this moment, the face of Mu Yang’s soul was filled with fear.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to kill him. Was he not afraid of the MU family’s revenge?</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The MU family’s experts were truly enraged. Someone roared, and his aura was so powerful that it seemed as if the entire world was trembling.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was the Emperor of the MU clan.</p><p>Mu yang was done for. His physical body had been completely destroyed, leaving only his soul. Even if he reincarnated, he would not have his previous achievements.</p><p>This infuriated the MU family’s powerhouses. They were about to attack and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at the next moment, at least ten cold gazes swept toward the MU clan’s Emperor Lord. As if a bucket of cold water had been poured on him, the MU clan’s Emperor Lord’s anger instantly died down, and he withdrew his aura.</p><p>This was the battle of the ten lands, where great emperors from all regions gathered. No one was allowed to disrupt it. If he attacked, a group of great emperors would attack instantly and kill him.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’d better let Muyang go!”</p><p>Mu clan Emperor didn’t dare to attack, so he could only threaten.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and could not be bothered.</p><p>“Tianyun, let me go! 1 beg you, let me go!”</p><p>At this point, Muyang was truly afraid. He knew that he had encountered a lawless person, so he was not afraid of him at all.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He had no intention of letting Muyang go.</p><p>With Muyang’s personality, letting him go might be even more dangerous. He would definitely take revenge and not give up.</p><p>Then what was the difference between letting go of Muyang or not?</p><p>“If I let you go, then I’ll find another assassin from the death god nation to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Mu yang was stunned. Then, his face twisted in disbelief. Finally, he cried out hysterically,”You’re Lu Ming, you’re Lu Ming. You’re not dead …”</p><p>Mu Yang’s shrieking voice spread in all directions. Everyone could hear it.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Ming, the son of chaos?”</p><p>“Didn’t the people of the death god nation spread the word that they had already killed Lu Ming? Don’t tell me he’s not dead!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>At that moment, Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes, like two stars.</p><p>The aura of the Galaxy Burst out. It was bathed in white divine light and stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“He is Lu Ming…”</p><p>Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others were all overjoyed.</p><p>“Master, it must be master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were also overjoyed!</p><p>They thought about why Lu Ming had helped them previously. They did not know him at all, but Lu Ming had helped them. They had been puzzled before, but they finally understood now.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“So, he’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Some great emperors whispered. They had long seen through Lu Ming’s true appearance. However, they had never seen Lu Ming before, so they had no idea that he was Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not hide anything. His body began to change and his true appearance was revealed.</p><p>“It’s really Lu Ming!”</p><p>Those who had seen Lu Ming before exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve said it before. How could Lu Ming die?”</p><p>Desolate li laughed.</p><p>“The death god nation really knows how to put gold on their own face!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang also laughed.</p><p>“Young master…”</p><p>Qiu Yue was overjoyed.</p><p>Some people who were familiar with Lu Ming were overjoyed.</p><p>Previously, although they did not believe that Lu Ming was dead, they could not help but worry.</p><p>The assassin organization of the death god nation was too terrifying. They were afraid that it might be true.</p><p>They were finally at ease when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why is he still not dead?”</p><p>Some of the people who had a grudge against Lu Ming had a change in their expressions and their faces turned ugly.</p><p>The Masters of the Heng family, the he family, the Daluo heaven sect, the WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, the Sirius tower, and other forces stood in the crowd. They were very indignant and very pitiful.</p><p>They could not wait for Lu Ming to be killed.</p><p>Especially those forces from ancient Moon Holy Land. Lu Ming was getting stronger and stronger. The pressure he gave them was too great, making them extremely worried.</p><p>“It’s really you!”</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, was shrouded in the light of chaos. He looked like a god of War as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>He had been invincible all his life and rarely suffered losses.</p><p>However, during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment, he had suffered a great loss. He was defeated by Lu Ming and lost the last legacy.</p><p>Moreover, the inheritance of the chaos Thearch was also in Lu Ming’s hands. He and Lu Ming were bound to have a battle.</p><p>that’s not right. How can he be Lu Ming? isn’t he the son of death who controls the death law?”</p><p>Some people calmed down and finally discovered the problem.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had clearly used the death rule. However, Lu Ming was the son of chaos.</p><p>The scene was originally very lively and many people were talking about it. Now, it suddenly quieted down and there was no sound at all.</p><p>Everyone was staring at Lu Ming. Their eyes were wide open and they could not wait to see through Lu Ming.</p><p>Even the great emperors and those close to Lu Ming, such as Huang Ling, were in disbelief.</p><p>Everyone, except Qiu Yue, had long known that Lu Ming had mastered the death rule. No one else had seen it before..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
