I can’t believe you can master the Law of Time and space. How about this? be my beast pet and fight with me!”</p><p>Yun Haoge said. He was indeed burning with passion.</p><p>If he had a pet that could master the laws of time and space with him, it would be of great help to him.</p><p>“You should be my human pet!”</p><p>Bubbles pursed her lips in disdain.</p><p>“I will make you convinced!”</p><p>Yun Haoge said coldly.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, is that person an idiot? He actually wants me to be his beast pet!”</p><p>In a flash, Paopao appeared on Lu Ming’s body. Her small body was like an octopus as she clung onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’s indeed stupid!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. It turned out that Lu Ming and bubbles had such a good relationship.</p><p>Could bubbles be Lu Ming’s pet? Was it raised by Lu Ming?</p><p>That was terrifying. The two of them had entered the top ten.</p><p>Yun Haoge’s face darkened as he cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other side, Bao de, ao ke, and ancient devil also looked at each other, their battle power bursting out.</p><p>The three of them all cultivated the immemorial system and were geniuses. Naturally, they wanted to see who was stronger.</p><p>Among the ten people, only Tianming stood there with a calm face. He always had a smile on his face, as if he was not involved in this.</p><p>At the scene, everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>The battle had not even started, and they were already in a state of mutual hostility. The final battle for the top ten would definitely be very exciting and could be called an epic showdown.</p><p>In the history of the primordial realm, there had never been so many geniuses, and there had never been a battle of the ten lands. This battle was unprecedented.</p><p>Many of the sons of God were reduced to a foil. If this was said decades ago, they would probably be laughed at to death.</p><p>In the past, a Son of God was a legend, a figure that could suppress an era.</p><p>However, in this era, he was reduced to a foil. This made countless people excited.</p><p>This battle was destined to be recorded in the history books and be passed down through the ages.</p><p>“You guys adjust your breathing. We’ll fight in three days!”</p><p>The white-haired old man announced once more.</p><p>Everyone looked for a place to rest and Lu Ming walked towards Qiu Yue and the rest.</p><p>“Young master, I knew you would be fine!”</p><p>Qiu Yue was overjoyed. She threw herself into Lu Ming’s arms, ignoring the strange looks from others.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Huang Ling walked over with a complicated look in her eyes, but it was hidden by her.</p><p>Following that, the others came over one after another to greet Lu Ming.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people at the side did not know that Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were Lu Ming’s disciples. When they saw them, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was young and extraordinary to begin with. Now, he even had two disciples of the Son of God. It was truly shocking. Even the great emperors were very envious.</p><p>“You two, cultivate well and strive to become divine emperors as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli.</p><p>At the same time, he thought of himself. It seemed that it would be very difficult for him to become a saint Emperor. Looking at the current situation, he was probably going to be surpassed by his two disciples. This made his old face blush slightly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saluted Emperor notionless, uncle Kong, and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming, this time, give it your all. After the ten lands battle, there will be great opportunities waiting for you!</p><p>Emperor formless smiled as he sent a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. There was still a great opportunity waiting for them.</p><p>However, thinking about it, it made sense. Previously, they had only been selected, yet they had been able to enter a corner of the world left behind by the primordial realm at the beginning. Their cultivation had rapidly increased, so now that it was the final battle, how could they not have any opportunities?</p><p>“I’ll do my best!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming chose a spot and sat cross-legged in the air. He circulated his energy and adjusted his breathing to his best condition.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>The final battle was about to begin.</p><p>The white-haired old man stood on the peak of destiny mountain. With a wave of his hand, a huge fighting stage appeared on the peak of destiny mountain. It was a hundred miles long and a hundred miles wide. It was purple-gold in color and full of nobility.</p><p>Obviously, the following battles would be held on this fighting ring.</p><p>the final ten ranking battles will be fought in turns. Everyone will have to fight against the other nine and be ranked according to their winning rate!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. As he had expected, it was indeed this hairstyle.</p><p>This method of ranking was the fairest. It was completely based on strength and there was no such thing as luck.</p><p>This method was also the most commonly used method. Lu Ming had encountered this method more than once or twice along the way.</p><p>“Also, you are not allowed to kill anyone in the battle between you two!”</p><p>The white-haired old man added.</p><p>Many people nodded. The last ten people were all extremely talented. If they died because of this, it would be a great loss, which was why there was such a rule.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt that it was a pity. He had wanted to take this opportunity to settle the problem of the Galaxy.</p><p>alright, I’ll arrange the order of the battles. The first battle is between Heng Xinghe and Lu Ming!</p><p>The white-haired elder announced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He did not expect that he would be the first one to fight. Moreover, his opponent was from the stellar River. Could it be that the white-haired elder had the intention?</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up. This was good too. He would start with the star River first.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Xing Chen’s figure also landed on the fighting ring. His eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit, like a flame, burning fiercely.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going to lose this time!”</p><p>Xingxing River shouted, his battle intent soaring.</p><p>“You were already defeated back then. Now, you are even less of a match for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head, his voice silent.</p><p>Many people were stunned and looked enlightened. It seemed that Lu Ming and the star River had already fought.</p><p>Heng Xing River and Lu Ming are both from Mount Yuan. Naturally, they’ve crossed swords before!</p><p>it seems that the Galaxy is not Lu Ming’s match. They have been defeated in the past!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>Hmph, that time, it was Lu Ming who took advantage of the situation!</p><p>The Heng family member explained.</p><p>The cultivators of the various forces in Yuan mountain were watching with full attention.</p><p>Lu Ming and Heng Xing River both came from Mount Yuan. In the past, Heng Xing River had always been known as the number one prodigy of Mount Yuan. Ever since Lu Ming’s rise, this phenomenon changed.</p><p>Whoever won this battle would be the number one genius of the yuan mountain.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, I’ll crush you. I’ll let you understand the difference between us!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, he took a step forward. With each step, a River of laws appeared on his body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
