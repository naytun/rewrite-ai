He did not expect that the mastermind behind this was the great emperor of the MU family.</p><p>The MU clan had actually sent someone to Mount Yuan.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked behind him and saw Emperor tianluo and the others.</p><p>“And the Daluo heaven sect!”</p><p>The cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>He had guessed that it might be the Daluo heaven sect, the Heng family, or the he family that was supporting them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill the MU family’s Mu yang! I’ll make sure you die with him today!”</p><p>The goateed Emperor said coldly. Then, he exploded with a terrifying aura.</p><p>This aura was terrifying and unimaginably powerful.</p><p>“He’s even stronger than the great emperor of the he clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. No wonder the other party was so confident when he knew that he could control the physical body of heaven and earth. It turned out that his cultivation had surpassed that of the he clan’s great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the celestial Thearch’s physical body without hesitation. He turned into a beam of light and entered the body.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body grew rapidly until it was like a giant.</p><p>the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is simply a waste of a heavenly treasure in your hands. Leave it to me!</p><p>The goateed Emperor’s eyes glowed with a scorching light as he took a step forward and extended his hand toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and controlled the celestial Thearch’s physical body. He held the stone sword and slashed out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The goateed Emperor’s Hand was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The goateed Emperor was shocked. Lu Ming’s control of the celestial Thearch body was more powerful than what the Emperor of tianluo had said.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly amazed.</p><p>He had stored up 36% of his energy. Although he had used up some of it, it was not much.</p><p>With so much energy stored, the power of the explosion was too shocking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl as he stepped into the void and charged toward the goateed Emperor.</p><p>With a slash, the stone sword turned into a hundred miles long and ten miles wide, suppressing the sky.</p><p>The stone sword sliced through the air toward the goateed Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The goateed Emperor also exploded with power. His body glowed with bright light, and the entire world was filled with an indescribable pressure.</p><p>The aura of the great Dao filled the air between heaven and earth.</p><p>The goateed Emperor was controlling the Dao, and two golden sabers appeared in his hands.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The saber and the stone sword collided.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle-blade in the goateed Emperor’s Hand buzzed as if it was under great pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming was valiant and invincible. Once again, he charged at the other party.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The goateed Emperor controlled the great Dao and charged toward Lu Ming with two golden blades.</p><p>The two of them fought in the sky.</p><p>However, the goateed Emperor was at a disadvantage as soon as they exchanged blows. He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming, and his body trembled as he retreated with every move.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Emperor tianluo, the Wind Clan leader, and the others were in shock.</p><p>The goateed great emperor was a two-star great emperor, much more powerful than the great emperors of the he clan, and was capable of killing them.</p><p>But now, he was being suppressed by Lu Ming and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Back in the heavenly Emperor City, when Lu Ming controlled the heavenly Emperor’s body, he could barely suppress the he family’s great emperor. Why was he more terrifying now?</p><p>“It’s not good!”</p><p>At this moment, the Feng clan’s patriarch, Wan clan’s patriarch, and the others all turned pale.</p><p>They were relying on the goatee Emperor and the Emperor of Tian Luo. However, the goatee Emperor was at a disadvantage. If he lost, Lu Ming would not let them go.</p><p>Their faces were filled with fear, and some of them were already considering whether they should escape first.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another explosion sounded in the sky, and the goateed Emperor was forced back as blood seeped out of his mouth.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The goateed Emperor roared in rage. He felt like he had been tricked.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. The more he fought, the braver he became. He completely disregarded his own defense and attacked his opponent madly.</p><p>He had to end the battle as soon as possible because the energy in Celestial Emperor’s body was being consumed too quickly.</p><p>If he dragged on for too long, he would be the one who was finished when the energy was exhausted.</p><p>Lu Ming completely abandoned his defense and attacked frantically.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The stone sword swept away the opponent’s saber. Lu Ming kicked out and landed a heavy kick on the goateed Emperor’s body. The goateed Emperor’s body almost exploded.</p><p>The goateed Emperor spat out a mouthful of blood as he retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming chased closely and continued to kill.</p><p>“Heavenly King, come and help me!”</p><p>The man with the goatee shouted for Emperor Tian Luo to help him.</p><p>Emperor tianluo’s expression changed. Finally, he gritted his teeth and took out a great emperor weapon. He charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>He had to get rid of Lu Ming today. Otherwise, he would be finished if the goatee Emperor died.</p><p>But at this moment, a bright sword light lit up the sky and slashed toward Emperor tianluo.</p><p>“Old bastard dan Kong!” Emperor tianluo was shocked and tried to resist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky exploded as uncle Kong’s figure appeared. His sword light was shocking as he continuously slashed toward the tianluo Emperor.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s cultivation base was already at the peak of one star great emperor, not far from two star great emperor.</p><p>Furthermore, uncle Kong had cultivated for countless years, so his battle power was clearly stronger than Emperor tianluo’s.</p><p>The battle power of a great emperor wasn’t just about cultivation, but also other aspects. Uncle Kong was obviously stronger in other aspects.</p><p>Back in the heavenly Emperor City, uncle Kong had been severely injured in the battle with the evil god tribe, which was why he had come to a draw with the great emperor Tian Luo.</p><p>Emperor tianluo was also suppressed. He could only try his best to resist.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Feng clan’s patriarch, the WAN clan’s patriarch, and the others all turned pale.</p><p>The two great emperors that they relied on were at a disadvantage.</p><p>If the two great emperors were defeated, they would be finished.</p><p>retreat! Retreat from here!</p><p>The wind race’s patriarch roared in anger. He had no choice. In order to protect the wind race, they could only retreat.</p><p>“It’s too late if you want to leave!”</p><p>A cold voice came from afar. Then, a large group of people appeared.</p><p>They were the powerhouses of the ten major forces, including Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect.</p><p>it’s you! You dare to attack my wind race? you’re courting death!</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch roared.</p><p>you are the ones who will die. Today, you will all be exterminated. Attack!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The top ten forces attacked the Feng clan’s Mountain Gate from all directions.</p><p>This time, the top ten forces had sent out almost all their powerhouses.</p><p>The dense crowd charged towards the wind tribe. The Martial Emperor realm experts took the lead and unleashed all kinds of terrifying attacks towards the wind tribe..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
