With each step, a River of laws would appear on his body.</p><p>With his first step, the Laws of Chaos formed a River that surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>With his second step, another river of laws appeared. It was the river of the law of death.</p><p>Chaos and death, the two most powerful rivers of laws, surrounded Lu Ming, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>This was because this was a scene that had never appeared in the primordial realm since ancient times. It could be called a miracle.</p><p>Many people even took out their image exterminating stones to record everything.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>The two rivers of laws had actually fused together and turned into a two-colored river of laws.</p><p>it’s fused. The two ultimate maxims have fused together!</p><p>Someone shouted in excitement.</p><p>Oh my God, this is heaven-defying! The two ultimate maxims have really fused together!</p><p>“What a miracle!”</p><p>Countless people shouted. Even the great emperors couldn’t keep calm anymore. Their eyes were wide open.</p><p>The fusion of two ultimate maxims was a legend.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Xin, Bao de, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>“What the f * ck, why is this guy always so perverted!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk chanted the name of Buddha, and his face turned bitter.</p><p>Even Tianming, who had always been calm and collected, had his smile disappear. He was surprised.</p><p>The star river’s mind was also shaken, and it revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>“I’ll defeat you!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward like a bolt of lightning, charging toward the star River.</p><p>“The eternal God Bell!”</p><p>The eternal Star River howled. He was unwilling to give up. He still wanted to fight.</p><p>A divine Bell with ancient patterns on it appeared on his body.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The eternal God Bell trembled and let out a terrifying sound of killing.</p><p>Compared to the past, the power of the eternal God clock of the stellar River was much stronger.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming’s chaos law and death law had merged, in addition to his extremely condensed Saint energy and physical strength, the combat power that erupted was too powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the attack from the Galaxy. He did not stop and continued to attack.</p><p>The sounds of killing landed on Lu Ming’s body but were blocked by the two-colored river of laws. They could not break through Lu Ming’s defense at all.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was close to the Galaxy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used the chaos Divine palm and fused the two ultimate maxims. He struck the eternal God Bell in the stellar River with his palm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The eternal God Bell trembled crazily and exploded with terrifying sound waves that swept in all directions.</p><p>Some true emperors and great sovereigns released a layer of light to block the sound waves. Otherwise, many people would have been injured. Those with weaker cultivation might have even been killed by the sound waves.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A cracking sound came from the eternal God Bell and cracks appeared on it. The cracks were like cobwebs that covered the eternal God Bell.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the eternal God Bell exploded into light spots and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm force did not stop and it bombarded Xinghe’s body. Xinghe’s body was like a rice straw man. He flew out and fell heavily on the ground, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>Xinghe had been defeated in just one move.</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>is the power of the fusion of two ultimate maxims so terrifying?”</p><p>Someone’s voice was hoarse and filled with disbelief.</p><p>Star River was a peerless genius who had made it into the top ten. However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move. The gap between them was shocking and overwhelming.</p><p>since ancient times, no one in the primordial realm has controlled two Supreme laws, nor has anyone fused two Supreme laws. No one knows what kind of power will be produced when two Supreme laws are fused!</p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p>Everyone took a deep breath. That was indeed the case.</p><p>Moreover, they recalled that Lu Ming could control a few types of laws. A few types of laws could form a River and would temper his Saint energy and physical body every time. No wonder Lu Ming’s combat strength was so strong. They finally understood.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his gaze looking at the Galaxy indifferently.</p><p>Xing Chen spat out another mouthful of blood. He could not accept this result.</p><p>Back then, he was the number one heaven’s favorite of Mount Yuan. He was high and mighty, looking down on others.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming, he did not care about him at all. Even though he knew that Lu Ming was the son of chaos, he did not care. He thought that he was strong enough to suppress all enemies and would not be defeated.</p><p>However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in the world of the lotus flower.</p><p>However, at that time, Lu Ming had cast some kind of secret skill. He had always thought that Lu Ming had borrowed external power and that he would not lose if he relied on his own strength.</p><p>All these years, he had been cultivating in seclusion, especially when he found out about the ten lands ‘battle. He cultivated even more arduously. He wanted to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat in the ten lands’ battle. He wanted to completely suppress Lu Ming and trample him under his feet.</p><p>Even though this time, geniuses were as numerous as clouds, exceeding his imagination, he still made it into the top ten.</p><p>Unfortunately, his opponent, Lu Ming, had an even more amazing performance.</p><p>Although he had yet to become a sovereign, he had mastered two ultimate laws. This was unprecedented.</p><p>And now, he had defeated him in one move. His combat strength was so strong that he could look down on him.</p><p>At this moment, his self-confidence and belief had suffered a huge blow. He kept coughing up blood.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family roared. Lu Ming was the nemesis of the Heng family.</p><p>“Master is mighty!”</p><p>“Master is invincible!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were shouting and wrangling. They were even happier than if they had won.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward. The long river of two-colored laws surrounded him, like a god descending to the mortal world.</p><p>The star River had not admitted defeat. If he wanted to fight again, it was exactly what Lu Ming wanted. He could Beat the Star River ruthlessly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Galaxy did not give him the chance.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Xinghe was extremely unwilling, but he could only admit defeat. Otherwise, he would only be tortured.</p><p>I’ve said it before. If I can defeat you once, then 1 can defeat you twice. In the future, you will never be my opponent!</p><p>Lu Ming left behind these words arrogantly and then flew out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression was ugly. He also retreated from the fighting ring, took a pill, and started to treat his injuries.</p><p>This was only his first battle. There were more battles waiting for him.</p><p>the first battle, Lu Ming wins. The second Battle, bubbles versus Yun Haoge!</p><p>The white-haired old man announced.</p><p>Many people’s eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>They realized that every match that followed would be very attractive.</p><p>Bubbles and Yun Haoge had both mastered the space-time law.</p><p>Moreover, according to the great emperor, bubble’s true form was a divine beast with a great origin. It made everyone’s heart itch as they wanted to know what bubble’s true form was.</p><p>“Bubbles, you can do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely beat up that guy who’s so weird! Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Pao Pao cried out.</p><p>Not far away, Yun Haoge’s face darkened.</p><p>What did he mean by being eccentric? when was he eccentric?</p><p>With a cold face, he stepped onto the fighting ring, and so did bubbles..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
