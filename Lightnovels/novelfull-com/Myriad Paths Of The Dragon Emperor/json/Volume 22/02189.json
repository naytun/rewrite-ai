Now that they saw that Lu Ming was using Saint energy and not World Energy, they immediately looked disdainful.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s hand, which was condensed with holy power, had already grabbed the broken sword.</p><p>Nothing happened at all, there was nothing unusual!</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his holy power and held the broken sword in his hand.</p><p>It was cold to the touch, and there was nothing special about it.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Lu Ming would not control the celestial Emperor’s sword to attack. After all, once the energy of the celestial Emperor’s physical body was exhausted, it was too troublesome to replenish it. The amount of resources required was also shocking.</p><p>it’s been too long. The spirituality in the broken sword has long been lost. It’s now a piece of scrap metal!</p><p>Lu Ming scanned it with his spiritual senses and realized that the broken sword was no longer of any use.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had successfully obtained the broken sword, LAN Yun and LAN Songshi smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, hurry up and give me the broken sword.”</p><p>LAN Yun said somewhat impatiently.</p><p>“Brother LAN, I was the one who obtained this Broken Sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around, looked at LAN Yun, and said indifferently.</p><p>brother Lu, leave it to me first. We’ll split the treasures equally when we get more!</p><p>LAN Yun said, his tone somewhat impatient.</p><p>If not for the fact that he wanted to make use of Lu Ming, he would definitely have fallen out with him.</p><p>LAN Songshi was even more direct, it’s a waste to leave such a treasure in the hands of a Saint realm like you. Hand it over to us first. We’ll naturally compensate you later!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart. He deliberately muttered to himself and said,”Alright then!”</p><p>He then tossed the broken sword to LAN Yun.</p><p>LAN Yun was overjoyed, and hurriedly took it and looked at it.</p><p>With a single glance, he revealed a disappointed expression.</p><p>“It has no spirituality at all, just like a piece of scrap metal!”</p><p>LAN Yun shook his head, but he still put away the broken sword.</p><p>“I still have matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>LAN Yun’s face sank.</p><p>that’s right. I still have something to do in my hometown. I have to find the exit and go back first. 1 won’t be accompanying you two in your treasure hunt!</p><p>Lu Ming randomly came up with a reason.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve explained so many problems to you and you’re just saying that you want to leave. It’s not that simple. Come with us!”</p><p>LAN Yun said coldly.</p><p>“Brat, let’s search for treasure together. Otherwise, don’t even think about leaving this place!”</p><p>LAN Songshi appeared behind Lu Ming, exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>They were trying to force Lu Ming to be their Pathfinder.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The other party had explained some problems for him, but he had already taken a risk for them and obtained the broken sword.</p><p>Furthermore, the reason why the other party was explaining the matter to him was because he had ill intentions from the start.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly and he smiled, alright, since that’s the case, I’ll go with you. However, we’ll split the treasures equally! “Naturally!”</p><p>LAN Yun said, but in his heart, he sneered at Lu Ming’s naivety. He wanted to split the loot equally. Even if Lu Ming did not die during the subsequent pathfinding process, they would not keep him after that.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Lu Ming exploded and raised his combat strength to the peak in an instant. He threw a palm at LAN Songshi.</p><p>This move was too sudden.</p><p>LAN Songshi was very strong. He was a four-star illusionary Emperor. In the face of danger, he roared and several laws emanated from his body.</p><p>But he was still a step too late.</p><p>Previously, they had thought that Lu Ming was only a figure below the rank of a martial Supreme and that they could kill anyone below the rank of a martial Supreme with a flip of their hands. Therefore, they were not as wary as before.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly made a killing move. In a hurry, LAN Songshi only had time to control the law and block in front of him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm hit LAN Songshi’s body. The law that covered LAN Songshi’s body trembled wildly and was finally penetrated by Lu Ming’s palm. The terrifying palm force surged into LAN Songshi’s body, creating a large transparent hole in his body.</p><p>LAN Songshi cried out in pain and retreated frantically, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>At that moment, he sensed seven types of laws from Lu Ming!</p><p>Two Supreme laws and five King path laws.</p><p>LAN Songshi was almost scared to death.</p><p>“This person’s combat strength is very strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming had already perfected five types of laws. The laws of alchemy and the laws of craftsmanship had not been perfected. His body had not been tempered, but his combat strength was much stronger than it was during the ten lands battle.</p><p>With his current battle strength, he could kill a five-star void Emperor if he were to unleash his full power.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming launched a sneak attack just now, he did not manage to kill LAN Songshi but only severely injured him.</p><p>LAN Songshi was only a four-star void Emperor!</p><p>He could sense three types of laws from LAN Songshi.</p><p>One king path law and two ordinary laws.</p><p>Furthermore, he had reached the second realm in two of his ordinary nomological laws.</p><p>LAN Songshi’s battle strength was much stronger than that of an ordinary four-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>And at this moment, LAN Yun also reacted.</p><p>“Piece of sh * t, you dare to attack? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed and burst out with his combat strength, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed towards the sand towards LAN Songshi.</p><p>He would deal with one first, then the other.</p><p>The other party wanted to use him as a test, how was that possible?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his palm. In an instant, he had struck dozens of times. Each palm contained seven types of laws and its power was shocking.</p><p>LAN Songshi was severely injured by Lu Ming and kept spitting blood. His strength was less than 20% of his peak. How could he withstand it? after a few moves, the law that protected him was destroyed.</p><p>The surging palm force fell on his body. LAN Song Shi’s body exploded before he could even scream.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After killing LAN Songshi, Lu Ming did not stop. He turned around and threw a palm behind him.</p><p>Because behind him, LAN Yun’s attack had also arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on LAN Yun’s fist, and a violent boom erupted. Lu Ming felt a powerful force surging toward him, and his figure retreated continuously.</p><p>LAN Yun wasn’t any better, his figure also floating back.</p><p>his ultimate Maxim has already reached the second realm. There’s still a King path Maxim!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>LAN Yun was undoubtedly a top heaven’s favorite, not any weaker than the ones who came to destiny mountain with heavenly Emperor Kong Yin.</p><p>A three-star illusionary Emperor could control an ultimate law and a King path law. He was so powerful that he was not weaker than the gray-robed young man who had fought with Lu Ming before.</p><p>And at this time, LAN Yun was even more shocked to the point of no return.</p><p>He could also sense the law that Lu Ming controlled and was extremely shocked.</p><p>it’s you. I remember now. You’re the trash body from the primordial realm, the peerless trash body!</p><p>LAN Yun suddenly roared.</p><p>He was also a top-notch heaven’s pride expert in the heaven realm. Back then, some people had gone to the primordial realm, and when they returned, they said that a peerless cripple had appeared in the primordial realm. He had mastered many kinds of nomological laws below the Martial Emperor realm, and he had even mastered two Supreme nomological laws. However, he could not become a sovereign. Back then, it had caused a commotion in the heaven realm.</p><p>Now that he was fighting with Lu Ming, he immediately remembered.</p><p>you’re a cripple. How dare you kill a member of the LAN family? you’re courting death!</p><p>Immediately, LAN Yunxiao released a cold killing intent and burst out with all his might, charging towards Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
