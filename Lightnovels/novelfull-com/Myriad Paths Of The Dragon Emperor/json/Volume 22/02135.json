Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the level of an Emperor-to-be, so he didn’t pay much attention to him. He never expected Lu Ming to be the number one genius of the primordial realm.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was more powerful than Destiny’s Child?</p><p>The heaven realm’s elites also looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“So it’s you, general. I’ll meet him!”</p><p>A voice was heard. A young man in a black robe stepped out of the chariot and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was dressed in a black robe and had long hair like a waterfall. His face was cold and arrogant, and his eyes were sharp. He was the young man Lu Ming had met in that world. At that time, this person was with the purple-haired young man, and the two seemed to be senior and junior brothers.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had fought with this person. However, the other party seemed to be busy and ignored Lu Ming.</p><p>He had long wanted to make a move. Now that he heard that Lu Ming was the number one prodigy of the primordial realm, he could not wait to make a move.</p><p>“Make your move. Let me see how strong you are!”</p><p>The black-robed young man stared at Lu Ming, his cold arrogance growing.</p><p>The aura on his body soared to the sky. He was a peak two-star void Emperor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Following that, six pitch-black vortexes appeared behind him, spinning non-stop. These were the reincarnation vortexes that wanted to devour people and send them into reincarnation.</p><p>This person was a child of Samsara!</p><p>In fact, after becoming a martial Supreme, there was almost no need to call him a Son of Heaven. This was because after becoming a martial Supreme, some people could cultivate an ultimate Maxim later on. Those who did so later on could not be called a Son of Heaven.</p><p>However, it was also difficult to distinguish who was innate and who was acquired. Therefore, those after the rank of martial Supreme rarely used this form of address.</p><p>However, the black-robed youth’s law of reincarnation was extremely oppressive. The six vortexes seemed to be able to swallow the entire world.</p><p>“Remember, the person who defeated you is called Li You!”</p><p>With that, the black-robed young man pressed down with one hand and six vortexes pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly!</p><p>Li You’s combat strength was definitely above Yuan Xin’s or even Tianming’s.</p><p>His cultivation base was at the peak of the two-star illusionary Emperor realm, which was not weaker than Tianming and Yuan Xin. Moreover, his law of reincarnation had broken through to the second realm, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hold back and exploded with all his strength.</p><p>All five types of nomological laws burst out, and a River of five-colored nomological laws surrounded his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The terrifying palm force hit the six reincarnation vortexes, causing them to tremble continuously. Li You’s body also trembled as he was forced to retreat continuously.</p><p>two ultimate maxims? impossible! How is that possible? ”</p><p>Li You’s shocked voice came out of his mouth.</p><p>He widened his eyes and stared at Lu Ming. He was in disbelief.</p><p>He could actually sense two ultimate maxims from Lu Ming. This was absolutely unbelievable.</p><p>He was not the only one. The other heaven realm’s paragons also widened their eyes and stared at Lu Ming in a daze, as if they had never seen the world.</p><p>“It’s your turn to be surprised now!”</p><p>Some of the primordial realm’s proud sons of heaven were excited. Seeing the heaven realm’s proud sons of heaven shocked them, they felt great.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Even the armored man couldn’t control himself. A terrifying aura burst out from his body, and his eyes were wide open.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying and oppressive aura filled the air. This aura made people feel as if they were facing the might of the heavens. They were unable to resist it, as if they were just an ant.</p><p>The stronger one’s cultivation was, the deeper one could sense it.</p><p>Many great emperors ‘faces changed and they broke out in a cold sweat. They looked at the figure sitting on the heaven chariot. The aura that was like the might of heaven came from this figure.</p><p>This figure had always been shrouded in divine light, so his appearance couldn’t be seen clearly. Before this, he had been very calm and didn’t show any signs of abnormality.</p><p>At this moment, after seeing Lu Ming erupt with two ultimate maxims, the figure fluctuated and revealed a trace of aura.</p><p>“Heavens … The celestial Emperor!”</p><p>An Emperor spoke with great difficulty, causing everyone’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>The celestial Emperor!</p><p>The figure sitting on the chariot was actually the celestial Thearch?</p><p>The celestial Emperor contained the might of the heavens!</p><p>However, as soon as the aura was released, it was retracted, and the terrifying pressure disappeared.</p><p>at the Emperor-to-be realm, you can actually comprehend two strongest laws and three king path laws. Hahaha, I didn’t expect such a person to appear in the primordial realm. Continue, let me experience it!</p><p>Li You was overjoyed instead of shocked. His fighting spirit grew stronger. He laughed and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Along the way, his aura grew stronger, and another law spread out.</p><p>Li You had mastered two types of nomological laws, one of which was the law of reincarnation and the other was the law of kings.</p><p>However, he had not broken into the second realm of the king path law. He was only at the completion of the first realm.</p><p>However, it also improved Li You’s combat strength.</p><p>“Six paths of reincarnation fist!”</p><p>Li You stretched out his arms and threw a punch. The force of the punch was imbued with the power of the law, and it was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Death’s blade!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast one of his strongest killing moves, the sword of death!</p><p>A huge combat sword was condensed in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had used this move to cut off the long river of destiny.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword of death slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out as the sword of death collided with the fist radiance, creating an endless amount of energy.</p><p>The Qi was like wild waves, wave after wave, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them retreated 100 meters after the attack.</p><p>Li You was indeed stronger than Tianming. Previously, Lu Ming could cut off Tianming’s River of destiny with one sword. Now, he could not defeat Li You. “Again!”</p><p>Li You let out a long howl and charged at Lu Ming again. The force of the six DAOs of reincarnation fist covered the sky and the earth as it came at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his eyes filled with excitement and fighting spirit.</p><p>He was indeed excited!</p><p>In the primordial realm, he was already invincible among the younger generation. Once he used the sword of death, even destiny would be defeated.</p><p>However, Li You was able to fight with him now. This would allow Lu Ming to continue perfecting the sword of death.</p><p>The sword of death was only a beginner. Lu Ming could barely unleash the profoundness of four types of laws, but he was still a long way from mastering it.</p><p>Only in the midst of a great battle could it be continuously perfected.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them charged at each other, constantly fighting and clashing. It was extremely intense.</p><p>“I didn’t expect there to be such a person in the primordial realm!”</p><p>The young man from the heaven realm had a serious expression on his face.</p><p>“Lu Ming is indeed powerful. He can fight against the heaven’s pride!”</p><p>The prides of the primordial realm smiled, feeling a little better.</p><p>Previously, the primordial realm’s prodigies had been completely suppressed by the heaven realm’s prodigies. Although the heaven realm had more resources, so the other party was stronger, and in terms of talent, they weren’t bad, they still didn’t feel good.</p><p>Now, there was finally someone who could fight against the heaven realm’s prodigies..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
