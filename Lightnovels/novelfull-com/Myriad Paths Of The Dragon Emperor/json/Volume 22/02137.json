The voice was clear and bright, but it contained Supreme dignity.</p><p>Hearing this voice, the gray-robed young man’s expression changed and he quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped as well. He retracted the power of the third bloodline and the blood-red light on Lu Ming’s body disappeared.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the figure sitting on the chariot, shrouded in divine light. He was the one who had just spoken.</p><p>At this moment, the figure stood up and stepped out of the chariot. The divine light on his body also retracted, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man who looked to be in his forties. He was wearing a long robe and looked quite elegant.</p><p>However, the great emperors of the primordial realm hurriedly saluted and bowed. “Greetings, Lord heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>It was indeed the celestial Thearch!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled violently, and then they followed suit and saluted. Their voices resounded through the sky.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man nodded. He swept his gaze across Lu Ming, then Tian Ming, Yuan Xin, and the rest, the primordial realm has also reached its golden age, and there are many elites. Not bad!</p><p>many of you are very talented. If you enter the heaven realm and receive the cultivation of the heaven realm, you will definitely be able to rise quickly. 1 have decided that this time, the top 320 of the primordial realm can follow me into the heaven realm to cultivate. Those cultivation Holy Lands will open their doors for you. At the same time, there will be heavenly emperors to guide you!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man said.</p><p>“What? The top three hundred and twenty can go!”</p><p>“And the celestial Thearch is personally guiding me!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Especially the top 320 heaven’s favorites, they were all ecstatic and excited.</p><p>This meant that the 320 people who had passed the selection could all go.</p><p>Many of those who hadn’t reached the 320th place had ugly expressions and sighed helplessly.</p><p>The heaven realm’s resources were much better than the primordial realm’s, and there was also the celestial Emperor’s guidance. This was too tempting, of course, when you enter the heaven realm, you will also be allowed to enter the battlefield. There will be some danger in fighting with the alien tribes. If you don’t want to go, 1 won’t force you. If you don’t want to go, you can ask now!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man said.</p><p>Not a single person stood out.</p><p>Who would be willing to miss such a rare opportunity?</p><p>Moreover, if they wanted to rise, they had to rise from the slaughter. These heaven’s favorites are not afraid of slaughter.</p><p>Without tempering himself, how could he reach the peak?</p><p>No one wanted to quit.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man nodded and looked at Lu Ming in surprise. After a while, he said,”The other people in the top 320 can go, but you can’t!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned by his words.</p><p>The celestial Thearch said that Lu Ming could not go?</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was obvious to all. His combat strength was unparalleled. He had yet to become a great emperor, but he had already mastered five types of laws, two ultimate laws, and three king path laws. His combat strength was so frightening that it could be said that it had never been seen before.</p><p>But now, the celestial Thearch actually said that Lu Ming could not go?</p><p>Could it be that there were other arrangements?</p><p>Many people’s imagination ran wild. Even Lu Ming himself was stunned. “Heavenly Emperor, why can’t 1 go?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little indignant. If he could go to the cultivation Holy Lands in the heaven realm to cultivate and even receive guidance from the celestial Thearch, his cultivation would definitely improve by leaps and bounds.</p><p>In the current great era, the foreign races were invading, and he didn’t know when a Great War would break out. He had to improve his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>your physique is unparalleled among those below the martial Supreme realm!</p><p>The celestial Thearch looked at Lu Ming and said slowly.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Even the celestial Thearch described Lu Ming’s unparalleled divine body as unparalleled.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Some people noticed that the celestial Thearch was referring to those below the martial sovereign realm.</p><p>“But at the same time, your body is also a peerless trash body!” The celestial Thearch continued.</p><p>What?</p><p>Countless people were shocked!</p><p>Previously, the celestial Thearch had said that Lu Ming’s physique was a peerless divine body. Why was he calling Lu Ming a peerless trash body now?</p><p>Everyone was at a loss and didn’t know what was going on.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>The celestial Thearch sighed as if he found it a pity, since ancient times, those who cultivate in the nomological system know that those below the Martial Emperor realm can only comprehend one type of nomological law at most. It’s impossible to control two types of nomological laws!</p><p>Many people’s hearts stirred. Lu Ming had mastered many types of laws. They knew that the celestial Thearch was most likely going to reveal some big secret.</p><p>The celestial Thearch continued, however, the heaven realm has been passed down for countless years. At the end of the primordial era, the system of nomological laws emerged. It has been countless years since then!</p><p>in such a long period of time, 1 wonder how many heaven’s favorites have appeared. Many of them have amazing talents!</p><p>in the distant past, there were people who broke the norm. Below the rank of martial Supreme, there were people who could control multiple laws. In fact, there were people who could control more laws than you. It was just that no one could control two ultimate laws at the same time!</p><p>those people below the Martial Emperor realm are extremely talented. Their combat strength is unparalleled and rare. They can easily kill a void Emperor, let alone those at the same realm. However, these people will never be able to break through to the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The celestial Thearch explained in detail.</p><p>Everyone was shocked, and their hearts were in turmoil, unable to calm down.</p><p>It turned out that in the ancient times of the heaven realm, there had been such a heaven-defying figure. Below the Martial Emperor realm, he had mastered many kinds of laws and had unparalleled combat strength.</p><p>However, the most shocking thing was that these people could not break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also shocked and dumbfounded.</p><p>He could not break through to the martial Supreme realm?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned red. He could not accept it.</p><p>At the same time, he remembered that he had tried to break through to the martial Supreme realm in that world, but he had failed and almost torn his Saint heart and body apart.</p><p>as we all know, to break through to the martial sovereign realm, one has to transform the laws in the Saint heart into the world core. Then, the world core will transform the Saint heart into a small world!</p><p>however, it’s very difficult to balance it when you control so many laws. You can say that it’s impossible to balance it at all and can’t evolve the world core. Once you break through by force, the terrifying power of the laws will tear the Saint heart and the person apart!</p><p>in history, geniuses like you all walked the two heaven’s path in the end. One of them was to forcefully break through, and then be torn apart by the power of laws and die!</p><p>the other is to be trapped in the Emperor-to-be realm for the rest of your life. Your life will be exhausted and you will die of depression!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s words were like thunder, exploding in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>This was because the celestial Thearch’s words were too similar to what he was facing. They were exactly the same.</p><p>No! That was impossible!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was dull and his eyes were bloodshot. He could not accept this fact.</p><p>If he could not break through to the rank of a martial Supreme, then what was the point of cultivating?</p><p>that’s impossible. My master will definitely break through to the rank of a martial Supreme. He’s unparalleled in the world!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang cried out. Her little face was pale and she could not accept this.</p><p>“I won’t!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli, Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others all shook their heads in disbelief.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>There was actually such a thing. It really was a magnitude 12 earthquake..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
