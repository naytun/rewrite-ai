Do you want me to live? ”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk’s face became even more bitter.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Those who had a grudge against Lu Ming, such as the Heng family, the he family, the Daluo heaven sect, the WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, and other forces, widened their eyes in disbelief and fear.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the more frightened they were.</p><p>Yuan Xin herself was also extremely shocked.</p><p>He had also comprehended a second type of nomological law and knew how difficult it was to comprehend other nomological laws. It would be even more difficult to fuse them together.</p><p>He had only succeeded in that world.</p><p>However, not only did Lu Ming control two ultimate maxims, but he had also comprehended two other King path maxims. He had comprehended four of them in total and had perfected them. He had fused them together. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Even with his intelligence, he was still shocked.</p><p>“So what if you have four types of laws? I’ll still defeat you!”</p><p>Yuan Xin let out a long howl and charged toward Lu Ming with an imposing aura.</p><p>His body glowed with a dark light, as if he was made of chaos stone. He was firm and immortal.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and used the chaos Divine palm to confront Yuan Xin.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The fighting ring shook again. In an instant, the two had exchanged more than 50 moves.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength had already surpassed Yuan Xin’s after he used four types of laws.</p><p>The more laws he fused, the stronger the power would be, multiplying it.</p><p>After more than fifty moves, Yuan Xin was completely at a disadvantage. She was forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>Yuan Xin was indignant. He roared and fought Lu Ming fearlessly.</p><p>He couldn’t lose!</p><p>This time, it was different from the Hunyuan sect’s assessment.</p><p>This time, it was a real battle. They used all their combat strength without holding back.</p><p>It was also a battle between the Sons of Chaos. If he lost to Lu Ming, he would definitely not be able to obtain the inheritance of the chaos Thearch. Moreover, he would have to live in Lu Ming’s shadow for the rest of his life.</p><p>This would be a fatal blow to his martial path.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 won’t lose if you can’t break my chaotic divine body!”</p><p>Yuan Xin roared.</p><p>“You’re thinking too much!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm continuously and pushed Yuan Xin back. He then hit Yuan Xin’s chest with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body trembled violently, and she was forced to retreat. Her face turned pale, and she almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to swing his palm upwards. In an instant, he struck out hundreds of palm strikes, and the palm prints enveloped Yuan Xin’s entire body.</p><p>Yuan Xin tried his best to resist, but the palm print still hit him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body trembled continuously. In the end, cracks actually appeared on his body, as if he was about to split apart.</p><p>He vomited a mouthful of blood as his body was sent flying and he fell heavily on the fighting ring.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>Yuan Xin had been defeated!</p><p>The entire place was silent!</p><p>Not many people had expected this outcome before the battle.</p><p>Most of the people had always thought that Tianming was first, Yuan Xin was second, and Lu Ming would be third at most. It was impossible for him to be a match for the first two.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had defeated Yuan Xin.</p><p>His next opponent was only destiny.</p><p>“Master is invincible!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shouted excitedly. Then, she looked at the few elders not far away and said,” “1 told you, my master is invincible. No one is his match!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The old men’s faces turned red.</p><p>Previously, they had said that Lu Xiangxiang was blindly confident and wanted her to see the reality that Lu Ming was no match for Yuan Xin and Tian Ming.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had defeated Yuan Xin.</p><p>Even though the few old men had lived for many years, they couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.</p><p>Uncle Kong and Emperor notionless also smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s progress had far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and walked toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>“I didn’t lose, 1 won’t lose to you!”</p><p>Yuan Xin howled wildly, extremely unwilling to give up. He rushed up again and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he was already injured. How could he be Lu Ming’s match? after a few moves, he was sent flying again. His body was about to crack, and his body was covered in cracks, oozing blood.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current abilities, he could shatter the void with one palm and destroy a mountain that was a hundred thousand feet tall. The power was shocking.</p><p>It was already very shocking that his Yuan Xin could survive so many palm strikes.</p><p>Yuan Xin roared angrily and wanted to fight again, but the white-haired old man stepped down from the sky and stopped him.</p><p>“You’ve already lost. You may leave!”</p><p>The white-haired elder said. Yuan Xin finally stopped and looked at Lu Ming with extreme unwillingness. Her eyes were flickering with cold killing intent.</p><p>after today’s defeat, you will never be my match. Also, you are not worthy of controlling the chaos Scripture!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Yuan Xin and turned to leave.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body trembled, and she spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>After that, the competition continued. However, the following matches were all within everyone’s expectations. There was nothing surprising.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to the final round.</p><p>The ninth round, the last round. After this round, each of the ten of them had fought against the other nine.</p><p>In the ninth round, Lu Ming would be going against destiny.</p><p>Before this, no one had any expectations for this battle. They thought that Tianming would definitely win.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming defeated Yuan Xin, everyone changed their minds.</p><p>At the very least, Lu Ming had defeated Yuan Xin and was qualified to compete with destiny.</p><p>After the eighth round ended, they rested for a while, and the ninth round began immediately.</p><p>In the last round, the white-haired elder seemed to have intentionally left the battle between Lu Ming and Tianming to the end. Everyone was itching to fight but they could only wait for the previous battles to end.</p><p>There were no surprises in the previous battles.</p><p>By the time the previous matches were over, everyone already knew the ranking this time.</p><p>Other than the first and second place, which were still unknown, the rest of the rankings had already been confirmed.</p><p>Third place, Yuan Xin. He only lost to Lu Ming and Tianming.</p><p>Fourth place, Bao de!</p><p>Fifth place, bubbles!</p><p>Sixth place, unscrupulous monk.</p><p>Seventh place, Chek!</p><p>In eighth place, Yun Haoge!</p><p>Ninth place, ancient devil!</p><p>10th place, Star River!</p><p>In the star River, he had lost all nine battles and had not won a single one. He had made his expression extremely unsightly.</p><p>Especially when he saw the last battle between Lu Ming and Tianming, his face turned even gloomier.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming had already left him far behind.</p><p>“The last battle, Tianming, against Lu Ming!”</p><p>The white-haired old man finally announced the names of the two people. Countless people’s hearts were in their throats.</p><p>It was finally the final battle. This battle would determine who was the strongest heaven’s favorite among the primordial realm’s younger generation.</p><p>Was it Lu Ming or destiny!</p><p>One had yet to become a sovereign, but he had already mastered two Supreme laws and two King Dao laws.
