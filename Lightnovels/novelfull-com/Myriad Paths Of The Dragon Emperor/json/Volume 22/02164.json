He still needed to comprehend.</p><p>However, it was definitely many times faster than before.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a few figures appeared in the sky above the valley.</p><p>There were a total of four people, an old man, two middle-aged men, and a middle-aged woman.</p><p>The four of them looked at the corpse of the giant snake in the valley and revealed a trace of surprise.</p><p>“You two, did you kill this giant snake?”</p><p>The old man spoke. He was clearly the leader of the four.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>both of you are young, but you’re able to kill a Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm giant snake. Your cultivation must be quite strong. Are you here for the Holy Spirit fruit as well?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“Holy Spirit fruit?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled, but he did not show it on his face.”You guys too?”</p><p>that’s right. We’ve received news that there’s a Holy Spirit fruit tree on Wuyuan mountain that’s about to ripen. A Holy Spirit fruit can give birth to a Saint realm expert. Many treasure-hunting teams have come here to fight for the Holy Spirit fruit!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“A Saint spirit fruit can give birth to a Saint?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He had read a lot of books in the Dayan elixir Hall, but he had never heard of a fruit like the Holy Spirit fruit. It was incredible that it could produce a Saint realm expert.</p><p>It seemed that the recovery of the divine wilderness continent had produced some impressive things. Lu Ming’s interest grew.</p><p>the two of you, are you willing to join us? the more people there are, the stronger we are. We can take care of each other on the road!</p><p>The old man asked again.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>Qiu Yue listened to Lu Ming completely. She would naturally follow whatever Lu Ming did.</p><p>The old man and the others all revealed looks of joy.</p><p>The fact that Lu Ming and his companion were able to move around in the mountains and kill a Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm giant snake meant that they were not weak. If they joined them, their strength would increase a little.</p><p>The main reason why Lu Ming joined them was to look at the Holy Spirit fruits. It would be good if he could pick a few of them and give them to his parents in the future.</p><p>After that, both parties introduced themselves to each other.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the old man’s name was I lan Zhong. The four of them were a treasure-hunting group.</p><p>Ever since the divine wilderness continent underwent a change, and all sorts of spiritual and sacred herbs began to recover, many treasure-hunting groups had appeared.</p><p>As the name suggested, these people traveled through famous mountains and rivers in search of all kinds of spiritual and sacred medicine to exchange for various cultivation resources.</p><p>This time, there were many treasure-hunting groups that came to the five elements mountain.</p><p>After the introduction, the group continued on their way. The old man went deeper into the mountain range.</p><p>As he walked, he looked for spirit herbs and sacred herbs.</p><p>there’s a strong medicinal fragrance ahead!</p><p>Suddenly, Han Zhong’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also smelled the strong medicinal fragrance coming from the front.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly walked forward and immediately saw a small patch of sparkling purple grass.</p><p>“A Bauhinia orchid!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized this type of grass.</p><p>The Amethyst orchid was a low-level Saint herb. It was very useful even for bright sages.</p><p>There were a total of seven stalks here.</p><p>Han Zhong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Seven Saint herbs had appeared ail of a sudden. Their value was not cheap.</p><p>However, it was clearly not that easy to obtain it.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>On the ground, there was a hissing sound, and purple threads were swimming.</p><p>They were tiny snakes the size of chopsticks. Their bodies were sparkling and translucent. Lu Ming took a glance and saw eleven of them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Eleven little snakes shot towards the crowd.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Han Zhong roared and attacked with the others, attacking the n small snakes.</p><p>The 11 snakes had high cultivation. They were all at the martial Royal realm. The strongest one was at the LV 3 martial Royal realm, which was the same as Han Zhong.</p><p>Was this still the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He really had an illusion that he was in the yuan continent.</p><p>Back in the day, in the divine wilderness continent, a first level Martial Emperor was an Overlord. They could create an Overlord force and dominate a region.</p><p>The second level of the martial Royal realm was almost the Dominator and invincible in the world!</p><p>The third level of the martial Royal realm was a legend.</p><p>At his peak, Xie Luan had been a Lv 3 martial Royal realm martial artist, and his reputation was unrivaled.</p><p>But now, a nest of snakes in a mountain was at the martial Royal realm. The strongest was at the LV 3 martial Royal realm.</p><p>It made Lu Ming feel as if time and space were in a mess, as if he was still in Yuan continent.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Han Zhong and the others were fighting the 11 purple snakes.</p><p>Han Zhong fought the third level martial Royal realm snake alone, while the others fought the other snakes.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue attacked as well. Of course, they did not use their full strength. They only used a portion of their strength.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had killed two small snakes in a row. The others were very surprised. Qiu Yue and Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger than they had imagined.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two big men and the middle-aged woman unleashed their full power and used all sorts of killing moves to suppress the small snakes and kill them.</p><p>“He has cultivation, but his combat power isn’t high!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head secretly.</p><p>He realized that although these people had reached the martial Royal realm, their combat strength was far inferior to those of the same level in the yuan continent.</p><p>This was because these people lacked domain martial techniques.</p><p>That’s right, Han Zhong and the others did it by force.</p><p>This was normal. Now that the world had recovered, the original Qi had increased greatly, and many people’s cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds. However, domain martial techniques would not appear out of thin air.</p><p>For example, the two middle-aged men were at the second level of the martial Royal realm. However, they could only barely suppress the first level martial Royal realm expert. It took them a lot of effort to kill him.</p><p>However, Han Zhong was at a disadvantage in the battle with the third level martial Royal realm snake.</p><p>The little purple snake moved like lightning. Its speed was shocking, and its body was as hard as iron, causing Han Zhong to be flustered.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a purple lightning bolt shot toward Han Zhong from another direction.</p><p>It was another purple snake, and its cultivation was also at Lv 3 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The middle-aged woman and the two burly men were shocked.</p><p>There was a third level martial Royal realm purple snake hiding at the side. It suddenly attacked Han Zhong.</p><p>It was already hard for Han Zhong to deal with one alone, and now there was another one that was attacking him. He had no way of avoiding it.</p><p>The two burly men wanted to save him, but it was too late.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming suddenly appeared behind Han Zhong and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The surging palm force directly sent the small snake flying.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not use his full strength. Otherwise, the purple snake would have been dead by now.</p><p>But with this block, the others finally reacted.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The two middle-aged men and the middle-aged woman charged toward the small snake. The three of them joined forces and fought the small snake.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue joined the fight and pretended to attack. Not long after, they killed the little snake.</p><p>Then, he helped Han Zhong to kill the little snake.</p><p>brother Lu’s combat strength is not bad. Why don’t you join our treasure-hunting team in the future and hunt for treasure together? ”</p><p>Han Zhong said with a hopeful expression..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
