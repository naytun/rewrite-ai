He realized that as the battle progressed, the power of his sword of death was getting stronger and stronger. He was also becoming more and more familiar with the use of the four types of laws.</p><p>this kid is using Li You to practice his divine power. What a terrifying talent!</p><p>The burly man in the armor saw through Lu Ming’s intention and was secretly shocked.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Li You roared in his heart. He realized that the more they fought, the stronger Lu Ming became. In the beginning, they were evenly matched, but now, Lu Ming was slowly suppressing him.</p><p>He was furious. He couldn’t be defeated by the primordial realm’s prodigy. He roared and fought Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>I’ll cultivate the chaos hammer!</p><p>Lu Ming could not care less about Li You’s thoughts. He was completely immersed in cultivating the divine power Technique now.</p><p>All of a sudden, his attack changed. The sword of death disappeared, and Lu Ming cast the hammer of chaos to fight with his opponent.</p><p>A giant hammer formed in Lu Ming’s hand and he smashed it at Li You. Each blow was so heavy that it could blow up a mountain and penetrate the earth.</p><p>The two of them engaged in a fierce battle and exchanged hundreds of moves. Lu Ming’s hammer of chaos was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swung the hammer of chaos and the sword of death at other times to hone his super power. Li You, on the other hand, was having a hard time. He was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming was getting stronger and stronger!</p><p>He roared. He didn’t want to be the first person to be defeated by the primordial realm’s proud Son of Heaven. He wanted to turn defeat into victory, but it was all in vain. He was no match.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, he was hit by Lu Ming’s hammer of chaos. Even his six reincarnation vortexes exploded. He was sent flying backward and blood spurted out.</p><p>His face was pale and extremely unsightly.</p><p>He had actually lost. He had lost to someone from the primordial realm.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Many of the youths of the primordial realm cheered, feeling extremely carefree.</p><p>The primordial realm had finally won a battle, but it had not lost so badly.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the rest jumped up in joy.</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming glared at Li You.</p><p>“Fight again!”</p><p>Li You roared, unwilling to admit defeat.</p><p>“Junior Brother, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Then, a figure stepped out. It was the purple-haired young man.</p><p>Li You seemed to be very obedient to the purple-haired young man and stopped.</p><p>Junior Brother, you’re not his match. If you continue to fight, you’ll definitely lose. There’s no need to. Let me do it!</p><p>The violet-haired youth smiled.</p><p>“Senior brother, are you going to make a move?”</p><p>Li You was stunned.</p><p>“I can suppress my cultivation and fight him!”</p><p>The purple-haired youth said.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to do anything. How about you leave this battle to me?”</p><p>Another voice was heard. It was the gray-robed young man who had defeated Yuan Xin earlier. At this moment, he stepped out.</p><p>The purple-haired young man pondered for a moment and said,” “You can make a move!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, right? make your move. Let me see your ability!”</p><p>The gray-robed youth said. A primordial chaos cauldron formed in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. He attacked immediately, the huge chaos hammer smashing towards the other party.</p><p>Since the gray-robed young man dared to attack, he must be stronger than Li You. Lu Ming did not hold back and went all out.</p><p>The gray-robed young man waved his hand and the grandmist cauldron spun, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Two types of laws!</p><p>The gray-robed young man also controlled two types of laws, an ultimate law and a King path law. However, like Li You, he had not reached the second realm of the king path law.</p><p>However, his primordial chaos laws were clearly more mature.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The hammer of chaos and the primordial chaos cauldron collided. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surge through the hammer of chaos. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>However, the primordial chaos cauldron was also sent flying and caught by the gray-robed youth.</p><p>“He’s stronger than Li You!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. The other party’s primordial chaos laws were clearly more profound and powerful.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid. He was only excited.</p><p>Another one for him to train.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the void and charged at the gray-robed young man again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After more than ten consecutive moves, although Lu Ming was at a slight disadvantage, he was not defeated. He became stronger as the battle progressed and he comprehended the divine ability in the battle.</p><p>you want to use me as a Whetstone? impossible! 1 didn’t say that I would suppress my cultivation to fight you!</p><p>The gray-robed young man said coldly. In the next moment, a shocking aura erupted from his body. It was much stronger than before.</p><p>A three-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>This was the gray-robed young man’s true cultivation. He had already reached the peak of three-star void Emperor and was only one step away from becoming a four-star void Emperor.</p><p>The gray-robed young man’s combat strength surged.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man waved his hand and the primordial chaos cauldron smashed toward Lu Ming again. Its power was much stronger than before.</p><p>The primordial chaos cauldron suppressed an area of the void, as large as a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated rapidly, but the primordial chaos cauldron followed him at an alarming speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used the hammer of chaos to blast it. The sky trembled and Lu Ming’s body shook violently as he was sent flying a few thousand meters.</p><p>His arm trembled slightly, and the web between his thumb and forefinger was split open, bleeding.</p><p>In the Martial Emperor realm, there was a huge difference between each stage.</p><p>A three-star void Emperor was much stronger than a two-star void Emperor.</p><p>If it was an ordinary three-star illusionary Emperor, Lu Ming would be able to kill him in seconds. However, the gray-robed young man was a genius among geniuses. He could kill enemies of a higher level than him. In fact, he could kill enemies of a higher level than him. Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The primordial chaos cauldron trembled once more and came crashing down on Lu Ming. Lu Ming was sent flying again. His qi and blood boiled and blood seeped out of the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“I can only use the third bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes. With a thought, the energy of the third bloodline gushed into his body continuously, covering him with a layer of blood-red light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura skyrocketed and his killing intent was endless.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming wielded the chaos hammer and struck the primordial chaos cauldron, sending it flying.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>Countless people looked at Lu Ming, dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming still had energy left. He had not used all his strength earlier. How was this possible?</p><p>They were all shocked.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Tian Ming, Yuan Xin, and the others were also shocked.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had defeated them without using his full strength. They had suffered a huge blow.</p><p>“It’s this secret technique!”</p><p>Xinghe’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Back in the world of the lotus flower, Lu Ming had used this secret skill to defeat him.</p><p>The experts of the Heng family, the he family, and other forces were even more shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying.</p><p>Some of the heaven realm’s geniuses also looked very serious.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man stepped on the primordial cauldron and charged at Lu Ming. Lu Ming welcomed him and fought with him.</p><p>After borrowing the power of his third bloodline, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased greatly. He had the upper hand in the continuous exchanges with the gray-robed young man.</p><p>“Alright, let’s stop here!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
