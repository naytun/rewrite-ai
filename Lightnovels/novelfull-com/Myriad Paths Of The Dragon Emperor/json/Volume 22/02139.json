To the heaven realm and the primordial realm, it was of great significance to nurture and let the peerless prodigies grow and become the pillars of support.</p><p>Therefore, every bit of resources was precious and must be used on the edge of the blade.</p><p>If Lu Ming could not break through to the martial Supreme realm, then he would lose his value in nurturing.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be, no matter how strong he was, was useless in the war with the alien races. The experts of the heaven realm would not waste their resources on a ‘trash’.</p><p>Therefore, if Lu Ming could not become a great emperor, he could only stay in the primordial realm and could not go to the heaven realm!</p><p>“Junior understands!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>alright, get ready. Adjust your condition to the peak!</p><p>The celestial Thearch said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and went to the side. He sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>He wanted to adjust his condition, his essence, Qi, and spirit to their peak.</p><p>The celestial Thearch began to inscribe a formation on the peak of destiny mountain. The peak of destiny mountain glowed with dazzling light.</p><p>Everyone was waiting there, and there were even more people.</p><p>Lu Ming could be said to be the unprecedented heaven’s favorite of the yuan continent. Everyone wanted to see if Lu Ming could become a sovereign.</p><p>Time flew by, and ten days were up!</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming opened his eyes and stepped onto destiny mountain’s peak.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s start!”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor spoke. During this period of time, everyone knew that the heavenly Emperor’s name was Kong Yin. People called him heavenly Emperor Kong Yin!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sat cross-legged on the top of destiny mountain.</p><p>“You must succeed!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the others were all very nervous and clenched their fists.</p><p>The Heng family, the he family, the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, the Skywolf tower, and other forces were also very nervous. However, their hearts were the opposite. They were hoping that Lu Ming would not succeed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A strong aura emanated from Lu Ming’s body. He was about to start his breakthrough.</p><p>The scene was completely silent. There was not a single sound.</p><p>With the celestial Thearch in charge, even those forces that had enmity with Lu Ming, such as the MU family, who wished for Lu Ming’s death, did not dare to make any moves and disturb Lu Ming’s breakthrough.</p><p>Otherwise, if they angered the celestial Emperor, the entire mu clan would be buried with him.</p><p>The Heng family, the he family, and other forces didn’t dare to make any moves.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming began to control the five types of laws and evolved the heart of the world in his Saint heart.</p><p>However, at this moment, the five nomologicai laws erupted. It was difficult for them to exist together. They collided with each other, and a terrifying tearing force burst forth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Just like the last time, it was difficult to succeed.</p><p>Lu Ming, focus your mind and focus on the transformation. I’ll protect your physical body and Saint heart!</p><p>Celestial Emperor Kong Yin said. He stretched out his hand, and the entire peak of destiny mountain was filled with multicolored light. Divine light emerged and enveloped Lu Ming’s body. Then, it seeped into his flesh and covered his Saint heart.</p><p>The formation’s power was protecting Lu Ming’s physical body and Saint heart.</p><p>“Evolution!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. He no longer cared about his physical body and his Saint heart. He controlled the five types of laws with all his might, trying to develop the world core in his Saint heart.</p><p>However, there were too many of the five nomologicai laws and it was difficult to achieve a balance. The forces were colliding and surging with each other. The terrifying forces were attacking outward.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Saint heart and physical body trembled violently as they were bombarded by the destructive power.</p><p>If celestial Thearch Kong Yin had not protected his Saint heart and body, Lu Ming would have been severely injured. His Saint heart might have exploded and his body would have been torn apart.</p><p>“I must succeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. He did not care and went all out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a series of rumbling sounds, as if there were experts fighting inside Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>His body burst out with rays of light like a sieve. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming coughed out a large mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>It could be seen that cracks had begun to appear on his body.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin’s face changed.</p><p>Even with his help, Lu Ming was still injured.</p><p>It was not that he did not have enough power, but when Lu Ming was breaking through, the law was agitated and burst out directly from Lu Ming’s body. In the end, it might attract the power of the heavenly Dao and cause Lu Ming to self-destruct.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Xiangxiang, Qiu Yue, and Feng Ling were all extremely nervous.</p><p>“Breakthrough!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and continued to break through.</p><p>He had to break through. His path of martial arts could not be severed just like that.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Cracks even appeared on Lu Ming’s Saint heart, and more cracks appeared on his physical body. Blood kept oozing out, as if it would fall apart at any moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop. You can’t continue. Otherwise, you’ll die!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin shouted.</p><p>“Breakthrough!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His eyes were filled with determination. He wanted to continue breaking through.</p><p>Many people were touched, and many people sighed. They could understand Lu Ming’s feelings.</p><p>As a peerless heaven’s favorite, how sad would it be if he was trapped in the Emperor-to-be realm for the rest of his life?</p><p>If they were in his shoes, many people would also try to break through at all costs.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>There were more cracks on Lu Ming’s body and blood spurted out from the cracks.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang said softly, tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue felt the same way. Her heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.</p><p>Everyone who was on good terms with Lu Ming could not bear to see this.</p><p>On the other hand, the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, and the other forces were overjoyed. They were shouting in their hearts that Lu Ming should not succeed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>At this moment, a crack appeared between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. It was as if his entire head was about to split open.</p><p>This was extremely dangerous. If it wasn’t handled properly, his body would explode and his soul would scatter.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Celestial Emperor Kong Yin shouted and pressed with one hand. A powerful and terrifying force surged into Lu Ming’s body, taking control of him.</p><p>He understood that if he did not interfere, Lu Ming would only be left with a dead end.</p><p>With the celestial Thearch’s intervention, Lu Ming could not control the law. The law dissipated and he spat out a mouthful of blood, his face pale.</p><p>“I failed!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>He failed again!</p><p>Furthermore, it was with the help of heavenly Emperor Kong Yin. However, he still failed and did not succeed in breaking through.</p><p>Could it be that he really had a peerless crippled body that would make it difficult for him to become a divine Emperor?</p><p>He was extremely unwilling. Along the way, he had experienced countless risks and storms. He had broken through all obstacles and reached today, stepping on the peak of the primordial realm’s younger generation.</p><p>In the end, it was blocked by the great emperor realm, unable to break through!</p><p>If he couldn’t become a saint Emperor, everything would be for naught. If a Great War were to break out in the future, he would be powerless to protect his loved ones.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>A voice roared in Lu Ming’s heart. He was unwilling to give up. He would not give up just like that. He would definitely break the shackles and create a miracle.</p><p>“Lu Ming, heal your injuries first!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Kong Yin spoke and a warm energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>With this energy flow, his injuries were actually rapidly recovering.</p><p>Lu Ming composed himself and circulated his cultivation technique. He controlled the energy and healed his injured body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
