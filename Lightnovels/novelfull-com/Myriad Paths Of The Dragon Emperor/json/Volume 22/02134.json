Moreover, two of them had already reached the second realm. This was simply frightening.</p><p>The heroic-looking woman had an imposing aura. She was dressed in iron armor and held a long spear in her hand, like a female war god.</p><p>She thrust her spear forward, and the wind and clouds changed color. Three laws burst out at the same time, and a terrifying long spear stabbed toward Tianming.</p><p>Tianming’s pupils rapidly contracted, and his eyes became incomparably serious. His entire body shone, and the river of fate appeared. He placed himself in the river of fate and used it to resist.</p><p>However, the huge spear seemed to be able to pierce through the sky. It pierced directly into the river of fate, causing it to shake continuously and stir up huge waves.</p><p>The laws of fate were extremely profound and powerful.</p><p>When he attacked, it was as if his words were law. One word could determine a person’s success or failure, life or death, and fate.</p><p>However, that was only relative to those with weaker cultivation. Once one’s cultivation reached a certain level, one could use strength to break through the laws of fate.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was like this!</p><p>And now, the heroic-looking woman was also the same!</p><p>The long river of fate surged and finally exploded. Tianming’s body trembled and he retreated, spurting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Destiny, defeated!</p><p>The scene was silent. Everyone was dumbfounded and found it difficult to speak.</p><p>Was this the heaven realm’s prodigy? he was only a King, yet he could defeat the primordial realm’s son of destiny. It made people feel like they were dreaming.</p><p>“So what if he’s the Son of God? So what if he was Destiny’s Child? I might have an absolute advantage below the rank of a martial sovereign, but after that, anything is possible. In the future, I’ll also use the king path law to derive the ultimate law and trample all the sons of God under my feet!”</p><p>The heroic-looking lady spoke, her voice filled with confidence.</p><p>She had a King’s body, and below the Martial Emperor realm, it was impossible for her to match the Son of Heaven. However, after she broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, she had comprehended three king path laws and even two of them had entered the second realm. Many of the sons of heaven at the same realm were not her match.</p><p>The heroic-looking woman’s words shook everyone’s hearts. It also made the eyes of many young people with King physiques and even those who cultivated ordinary laws light up.</p><p>Indeed, so what if they were lagging behind now? they still had a chance. After breaking through to the martial sovereign realm, they might be able to erupt and surpass the Son of God, charging all the way up and reaching the peak.</p><p>Some of the older generation shook their heads. It was easier said than done to achieve this.</p><p>Even after breaking through to the martial sovereign realm, it was extremely difficult to comprehend King path laws. It was even more difficult to comprehend an ultimate law. It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>For a heroic-looking woman to be able to reach this stage, she was already a rare heaven’s favorite.</p><p>However, they naturally wouldn’t open their mouths to dampen the young people’s enthusiasm.</p><p>The heroic-looking woman didn’t say anything else and returned to the chariot.</p><p>Tianming’s face turned ugly!</p><p>In the past, he had been invincible and unrivaled in the younger generation.</p><p>But during this period of time, he had suffered a series of defeats.</p><p>First, he lost to Lu Ming, who had not become an Emperor.</p><p>Now, he had lost to a King physique, which dealt a huge blow to his self-confidence.</p><p>At the same time, the young people of the primordial realm also looked dejected.</p><p>The heaven realm’s prodigies were too strong. No one in the primordial realm could defeat them, and they suffered defeat after defeat.</p><p>the heaven realm’s heaven’s pride experts are probably the strongest in the heaven realm. The heaven realm’s resources are better, so it’s normal for them to have such cultivation!</p><p>“That’s right, they must be the strongest group of people in the heaven realm!”</p><p>Some of the young men were discussing. Although they were discussing in low voices, they were still heard by the people of the heaven realm.</p><p>The gray-robed young man from before sneered and said,” you don’t have to comfort yourself. In the heaven realm, we are not the strongest group at all. At most, we are only in the second level. The strongest group of people are much stronger than me!</p><p>What?</p><p>These words stunned the geniuses of the primordial realm. Even many of the older generation were stunned.</p><p>These young people in the heaven realm were actually not the strongest. In the heaven realm, there were people stronger than them, and they could only be regarded as second-grade.</p><p>Many of the primordial realm’s proud Children of Heaven had ugly expressions.</p><p>Even Tianming, Yuan Xin, Bao de, and the others had unsightly expressions and were somewhat discouraged.</p><p>“Is the gap between our primordial realm and the heaven realm that big?”</p><p>“I heard that there’s only one heaven domain left in the heaven realm. How can it still be so terrifying? How strong would he be if he was at his peak?”</p><p>Many people were discussing and became more and more dejected.</p><p>“You guys don’t have to be discouraged!”</p><p>At this time, the armored man stepped out and his voice spread throughout the whole area.</p><p>Many people looked at him!</p><p>your talents are actually not bad. Many people’s talents are no worse than the top heaven’s favorites in the heaven realm. What you lack is resources and training!</p><p>the heaven realm has existed for countless years. Although there is only one heaven domain left, it is the largest heaven domain. The resources, treasures, and various cultivation Holy Lands that have been accumulated over countless years are incomparable to those of the primordial realm. That is why their cultivation is stronger than yours!</p><p>also, the heavenly realm is currently at war with the outsiders. Sometimes, they will step onto the battlefield and fight to the death. Only by tempering themselves through life and death can they become stronger!</p><p>The armored man said.</p><p>His words made the eyes of many of the primordial realm’s proud Children of Heaven light up again, and they regained their confidence.</p><p>That’s right, it wasn’t that they were lacking in talent, it was just that they didn’t have as many resources as the heaven realm’s prodigies.</p><p>How could the Son of God be lacking in talent?</p><p>therefore, this time, I will bring a group of primordial realm’s prodigies to the heaven realm. The resources in the heaven realm will be completely open to you!</p><p>The armored man said.</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites ‘eyes lit up with joy.</p><p>The primordial realm couldn’t compare to the heaven realm’s resources and all kinds of cultivation Holy Lands. They were moved and wanted to go.</p><p>They understood that this was the reward for the battle of the ten lands and it was really tempting.</p><p>It was obvious that the heaven realm was trying to nurture the geniuses so that they could rise up quickly.</p><p>“As long as you obtain the resources of the heaven realm, you might be able to compete with them in the future!”</p><p>The armored man pointed at the heaven realm’s prodigies and encouraged everyone.</p><p>senior, actually, the number one genius of the primordial realm hasn’t made a move yet. If he did, he might not lose!</p><p>A youth from the primordial realm spoke up. Previously, their primordial realm had been continuously defeated, and some of the youths were still feeling uncomfortable. At this moment, someone couldn’t help but say.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The armored man and the heaven realm’s paragons all looked surprised.</p><p>At first, they all thought that Tianming was the number one genius of the primordial realm. They didn’t expect that he wasn’t. The number one of the primordial realm was someone else?</p><p>who’s the first in the primordial realm? ”</p><p>The armored man asked.</p><p>Many people’s gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He did not want to stand out at first because the heaven realm’s proud Children of Heaven had very high cultivation levels. Even if he fought, he might not be able to win. But now, he was pushed out.</p><p>He could only step forward and cup his fists at the armored man, saying,” “Lu Ming of the junior generation greets the senior!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
