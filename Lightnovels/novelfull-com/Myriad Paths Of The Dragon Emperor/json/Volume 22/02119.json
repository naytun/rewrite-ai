We both cultivate the spacetime laws. It’ll be beneficial to both of us!</p><p>Yun Haoge spoke again.</p><p>“It’s the same the other way around, you can just be my human pet!”</p><p>Paopao pouted and said.</p><p>you don’t agree?” Yun Haoge’s face darkened. I’ll beat you up until you agree!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yun Haoge moved. As he moved, the space around him rippled like water. His body seemed to be traveling through space at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>Many people had only just seen him move when Yun Haoge’s body had already appeared in front of her in the next instant. His hand reached out and grabbed at her.</p><p>The bubble did not even have time to Dodge and was caught by the other party’s large hand.</p><p>However, Yun Haoge’s grip on the bubble missed. The bubble’s figure shattered like an illusion.</p><p>It was just a mirror image and bubble had already left the place.</p><p>Just as Yun Haoge grabbed onto bubbles ‘mirror image, bubbles’ figure suddenly appeared behind Yun Haoge. She reached out her tiny hand and attacked Yun Haoge.</p><p>At the same time, Yun Haoge’s figure shattered with a bang. This was also a mirror image, and Yun Haoge’s figure had already left.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In an instant, Yun Haoge’s figure appeared behind Paopao. Not only that, there were more than ten other figures of Yun Haoge in the other parts of the fighting ring.</p><p>“So fun, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles shrieked and disappeared. The next moment, more than a dozen figures appeared and pounced on Yun Haoge.</p><p>In an instant, figures flashed on the fighting ring. One after another, figures appeared, but they were constantly defeated. In the end, they realized that they were all mirror images. Not a single one hit the real one.</p><p>Many people with weaker cultivation were dazzled by the scene.</p><p>It was impossible to see the real body and the mirror image. One could only see that the space on the fighting ring was rippling like water. Figures flashed and attacked. In an instant, dozens or even hundreds of figures were crossing each other.</p><p>And as time passed, their speed was extremely fast. In the end, the two figures could no longer be seen.</p><p>Lu Ming channeled the Holy power into his eyes and finally caught sight of the two of them.</p><p>so powerful. The two of them have reached an extremely profound realm in their use of the space time laws!</p><p>A true Emperor spoke, sighing in admiration.</p><p>Space-time laws were extremely profound to begin with. An ordinary person wouldn’t even be able to touch a person who could control the space-time laws.</p><p>This was the use of time and space, the collision of time and space.</p><p>It had only been a minute, but the two had already exchanged countless moves.</p><p>“Let me break your space-time law!”</p><p>Yun Haoge was getting impatient. All of his silhouettes disappeared, leaving only one figure behind.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His aura became even more violent. The world power surged and rushed out with the spacetime laws. With him as the center, the space kept collapsing and exploding.</p><p>Even time had been thrown into disorder.</p><p>A two-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>This was Yun Haoge’s current realm!</p><p>He wanted to crush bubbles with his powerful realm.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With him as the center, it was as if a Level-12 Gale had been set off and swept toward the bubbles. Wherever it passed, space exploded, time was thrown into chaos, and the bubbles ‘mirror images shattered one by one.</p><p>Bubble’s true form appeared, bobbling in the space-time turbulence.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Yun Haoge said coldly. Taking a step forward, he appeared right before her with a sword in his hand.</p><p>This was a combat sword formed from the power of spacetime. It was extremely sharp as it slashed towards Paopao.</p><p>Bubbles waved her hand and a spacetime sword appeared in her hand, clashing with her opponent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The void trembled. In the end, Pao Pao’s cultivation level was still slightly lacking. She was only a one-star void Emperor. In terms of strength, she was no match for the other party and was sent flying.</p><p>After Yun Haoge had sent bubbles flying, he chased after her relentlessly and once again charged towards her.</p><p>After a few consecutive moves, bubbles was suppressed and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Yun Haoge used his stronger cultivation base to continuously shatter the surrounding space and disrupt the power of time, forcing the bubble to fight him head-on.</p><p>“Bubbles, you can do it!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the rest cheered for bubbles.</p><p>“Be my tamed beast!”</p><p>Yun Haoge’s eyes were cold as he stared at bubbles.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Bubbles cried out, her eyes filled with rage. A White Radiance emanated from her body, and in the next moment, she transformed into her true form.</p><p>It was a small and exquisite spirit mouse. Its fur was snow-white and sparkling, and it flickered with a little luster. It was exceptionally cute.</p><p>“This … Could it be a space-time spirit mouse?”</p><p>one of the top ten war beasts, the space-time spirit rat!</p><p>Someone exclaimed, and the scene was in an uproar again.</p><p>it’s a space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>Yun Haoge’s eyes burned even more fervently, filled with a glint of greed. He could not wait to have all of them for himself.</p><p>In the yuan continent, there were some heaven’s favorites who could awaken the bloodline of the top ten Battle Beasts. The yuan realm was vast and there were many such heaven’s favorites.</p><p>However, the heaven’s favorites who have awakened the bloodline of the top ten beasts are only humans. They have only awakened a trace of their bloodline. The difference between them and the top ten beasts is too great.</p><p>There were countless divine beasts in the world, but only ten of them were in the top ten!</p><p>Every one of the top ten beasts was unique. In this world, it was impossible for two of the same top ten beasts to appear.</p><p>Every single one of them was unique.</p><p>Only after one of the top ten war beasts had fallen would a new one be born.</p><p>In the ancient era, each of the top ten Battle Beasts was a peak expert in the world. One could imagine the power and talent of the top ten Battle Beasts.</p><p>But now, it was a young space-time spirit rat, which was very rare.</p><p>the space-time spirit mouse is mine, mine!</p><p>Yun Haoge roared in his heart.</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse was born with the ability to control time and space. If he could get it, it would be a great help to him.</p><p>“Surrender!”</p><p>Yun Haoge continued to charge towards Pao Pao.</p><p>“Human pet, you’re the one who surrendered!”</p><p>Paoba called out. Her body glowed and white rays of light spread out, causing the void to ripple like water once again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bubble’s figure disappeared as he traveled through space-time without leaving a trace.</p><p>At the same time, the space around him started to shrink, pressing down on Yun Haoge.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Yun Haoge shouted as his two-star illusionary divine cultivation base burst forth. Along with his space-time law, he was about to shatter the space in all directions.</p><p>But the next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>He felt that his spacetime laws were being suppressed. What was even more shocking was that his spacetime laws were being controlled.</p><p>The space-time laws that burst out from him instead pressed down on himself.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yun Haoge’s body trembled violently as the endless power of spacetime pressed down on him, piercing through his world power. His body flew out and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Earlier on, Yun Haoge clearly had the upper hand. How did the situation turn around in the blink of an eye? Yun Haoge was injured by bubble in one move.</p><p>This reversal was too fast..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
