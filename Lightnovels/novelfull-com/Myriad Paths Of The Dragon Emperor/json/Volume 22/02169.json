The world has changed, precious medicine is everywhere, and strong people have emerged in large numbers. This has allowed my cultivation to break through to the martial Royal realm!</p><p>A white-haired old man sighed, his eyes complicated.</p><p>Originally, with his talent, he could only break through to the spiritual God Realm, and his lifespan was limited. However, when he was about to die, the world changed and all living things were revived. His cultivation also advanced by leaps and bounds, and he even entered the martial Royal realm not long ago. His lifespan increased greatly, so how could he not be amazed?</p><p>The origin Qi in this world was rich. Not only did it increase his cultivation speed, but there were also Saint fruits that could transform his bloodline and evolve. It was terrifying.</p><p>However, even though there were only a few of them, there were still many people who obtained them, and their talents increased greatly.</p><p>yes, the cultivation environment today is too good. In the past, it would be hard to imagine. Can’t you see that even the strong people of the yuan continent have come to occupy the territory? ”</p><p>speaking of this, there’s a big event that’s about to start soon. It’s about the three major powers of the yuan continent. I heard that the three major powers of the yuan continent will have a showdown in three months to redivide the territories!</p><p>“There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Many people in the restaurant were shocked.</p><p>“I heard about it from the grapevine. I guess it will be revealed to the public soon. The East barren is undoubtedly the best place now. Many people are coveting it. Now, it has been occupied by the divine ox Palace. The monarch race and the barbaric Dragon Temple both want to occupy the East barren. There will definitely be a battle!”</p><p>that’s right. However, the three major powers of the yuan continent seem to be on par with each other in terms of strength. Once the war starts, there will be heavy casualties!</p><p>no, 1 heard that the three superpowers will use a special method this time. The three superpowers will each send out their young elites to fight, and they must be elites from the divine wilderness continent. The territory will be allocated according to the battle results!</p><p>there’s actually such a thing. It’s a battle between The Young Elites of the divine wilderness. It looks like there will be a good show to watch in three months!</p><p>In the restaurant, many people were interested and gathered around the person who knew the news.</p><p>Being surrounded by people, that person was very pleased and spoke a lot more.</p><p>That person said that the duel in three months would most likely be held at the original headquarters of the Dragon Alliance, the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>And now, the Imperial Dragon City was occupied by sakra.</p><p>“I wonder how’s our parents? are they in Dragon Emperor City?”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He was also worried.</p><p>speaking of elites, the divine wilderness is now filled with elites, especially the top ten. They are all Dragons and phoenixes among themselves, with unfathomable cultivation levels!</p><p>that’s right. I heard that the top 10 heaven’s favorites have all entered the sect of a Yuan continent expert. How can they not be strong? ”</p><p>especially the number one heaven’s favorite, Ren qianxing. He’s an unparalleled heaven’s favorite that’s rarely seen throughout the ages. His talent is unparalleled, and even sakra personally accepted him as a disciple! yes, speaking of Ren qianxing, he’s indeed an amazing person. No one can compare to him today. In my opinion, only the former leader of the Dragon Alliance, Lu Ming, can be compared to Ren qianxing!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The crowd continued their discussion. At the end of the discussion, they actually talked about Lu Ming. They had no idea that the person in question was sitting there.</p><p>“Hmph, a bunch of ignorant people. What do you know?”</p><p>At this moment, a sneer was heard throughout the restaurant.</p><p>Then, a young man walked out of a private room.</p><p>This person was thin and his eyes were long and narrow. When he opened and closed his eyes, a sharp light flashed.</p><p>“Then, young master, what do you think?”</p><p>One of the old men who had been discussing earlier cupped his fists and said.</p><p>a bunch of idiots. How dare they talk about the heroes of the world? who the hell is that Lu Ming? how can he be compared to Ren qianxing? he’s not even fit to carry Ren qianxing’s shoes!</p><p>let’s not talk about Ren qianxing. Which of the top ten heaven’s pride experts Can Lu Ming compare to? ”</p><p>The skinny young man sneered.</p><p>The other people’s faces changed.</p><p>However, thinking about it, times were different now.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s cultivation level back then? They hadn’t even reached the martial Royal realm yet. Now, the top ten talents all had unfathomable cultivation. It was said that many of them had reached the half-Saint realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>The achievements of the paragons today were indeed far above Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Hmph, if Lu Ming were still here, any one of the top ten prodigies would be able to suppress him with a flip of their hands!</p><p>The skinny young man said.</p><p>what a big mouth! The Alliance master of the Dragon Alliance is number one throughout the ages. How can those so-called geniuses be compared to him? what a joke!</p><p>At this time, a cold voice was heard.</p><p>“Who’s there? get out here!”</p><p>The skinny young man shouted coldly.</p><p>Then, footsteps were heard from the stairs of the restaurant, and two young men and women walked up.</p><p>“Xiao Shan, Xiao Rou!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was very surprised.</p><p>The two young men and women were Lu Ming’s in-name disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou!</p><p>What a coincidence, he didn’t expect to meet her here.</p><p>After not seeing each other for more than ten years, the two of them had matured a lot. They looked to be in their twenties and had extraordinary bearings.</p><p>However, both of them had anger on their faces.</p><p>They were furious that Lu Ming was humiliated.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The skinny young man asked with a sneer.</p><p>“Zhuang Xiaoshan!”</p><p>“Zhuang xiaorou!”</p><p>The two of them reported their names.</p><p>“So, it’s you two. The two legendary disciples of Lu Ming. Hehe, why? To seek justice for your master? But I’m telling the truth. Your master might have been good in the past, but now, he’s just average. How can he compare to the ten prodigies?”</p><p>The skinny young man sneered, his voice filled with mockery.</p><p>before the world changed, my master came from an isolated place in the eastern barren territory. He went against the flow and fought against the heroes of the world. In the end, he even defeated all the overlords in the divine wilderness and established the Dragon Alliance. Such a battle record has never been seen before. Who can compare to him?”</p><p>the so-called top ten heaven’s favorites now only have some achievements because of the good environment and the guidance of the strong people in the yuan continent. Compared to my master, they are nothing!</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan shouted.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The skinny young man shouted, and his body was filled with cold killing intent,”Kneel down, slap your own mouth, and take back what you just said!” “Hehe, I’m just speaking the truth. If my master hadn’t left, how could there be any of the ten proud sons of heaven? Back then, when my master was still around, what was Ren qianxing? he didn’t even have the right to meet my master!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan sneered. He stood straight and was not afraid of the other party.</p><p>he really knows how to flatter himself. Today, 1, Li Ke, will experience the skills of the disciple of the Dragon Alliance master!</p><p>The skinny young man’s face turned even colder. His killing intent flashed and his aura turned cold, causing the temperature above the restaurant to drop sharply.</p><p>“What? He’s Li Ke, one of the top ten chosen!”</p><p>After the skinny young man reported his name, someone exclaimed. This skinny young man was actually one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>It was no wonder that Lu Ming was so angry when Zhuang Xiaoshan said that the top ten talents were not as good as him.</p><p>“I heard that li is a staunch supporter of Ren qianxing, and has a very good relationship with him!”</p><p>Someone else whispered.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s faces also became serious..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
