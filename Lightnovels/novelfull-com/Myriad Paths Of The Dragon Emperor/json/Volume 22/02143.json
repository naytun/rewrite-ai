My golden Crow clan can easily send out a high-level void Emperor to suppress him!</p><p>One of the Golden Crow race experts sneered.</p><p>it must be because he has done too much evil. The retribution he received is really satisfying!</p><p>A giant wolf from the Skywolf tower opened his mouth and even grinned.</p><p>The others sighed. It was indeed a pity that Lu Ming could not become an Emperor.</p><p>Very quickly, the news of Lu Ming’s return to ancient Moon sanctuary spread from ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop along the way. Soon, he and Qiu Yue returned to the Dayan elixir Palace.</p><p>“Junior Brother!”</p><p>“Junior Brother!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had been cultivating in the Dayan elixir Palace. Their cultivation levels were not high, so they did not go to the land of divine destiny. When they saw Lu Ming return, they smiled.</p><p>“Junior Brother, Senior Sister believes in you. You will definitely become an Emperor in the future!”</p><p>Xue ningxin came over to comfort him.</p><p>“Not bad, you’ll blind everyone’s eyes when the time comes!”</p><p>Tian Chui also walked over, consoling him.</p><p>“Of course, I will definitely create a miracle!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said half-jokingly. After this period of time, he had adjusted his mood.</p><p>He didn’t give up on the path to becoming an Emperor, and he would slowly search for it in the future.</p><p>However, at the current stage, he could still continue to comprehend new laws, and his strength could continue to increase. He was not in a hurry.</p><p>Furthermore, he had heard that there was a prerequisite for breaking through to the great emperor realm, which was to cultivate all nine types of nomological laws to the perfected Third Realm.</p><p>Then, the nine types of nomological laws would be integrated, and the quantity would become a qualitative change, turning into a great Dao. Only then would one become a great emperor.</p><p>Therefore, he was trying to comprehend more laws and would not do anything useless. In the future, if he really broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, his cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>“Come, let’s drink to our hearts” content!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed as he took out a jar of fine wine, and everyone began to drink.</p><p>Qiu Yue was also by Lu Ming’s side. After drinking a jar of wine, her face turned red, as if she was a fairy from the nine Heavens who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p>The few of them drank and chatted until the next day.</p><p>Lu Ming had intended to take a break, but at this moment, he received a voice transmission that someone had come to the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>“Lady mu, brother ye!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the Dayan elixir furnace and saw a few young men.</p><p>Mu Qingxue and ye Dongfang were among them.</p><p>In the ancient Moon sanctuary, apart from Feng Ling, Long Chen, and a few others, Lu Ming had the best relationship with mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and the others.</p><p>Obviously, they had also heard the news of Lu Ming’s return.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we just heard that you’re back. Lu Ming, we all believe in you. You’ll definitely become an Emperor one day!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and the others also comforted him.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and invited the few of them in to have a seat.</p><p>Lu Ming, the younger generation of the ancient Moon Holy Land has decided to invite you to a banquet three days later to congratulate you on becoming the champion of the battle of the ten lands!</p><p>Finally, ye Dongfang spoke.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll definitely go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The few of them chatted for a while more before mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and the others left.</p><p>Lu Ming rested for a while before he continued to study the alchemy Dao laws.</p><p>During this period of time, he had already cultivated the alchemy Dao laws to 60% maturity. His speed could be said to be extremely fast.</p><p>On this day, the Golden Crow clan, the Skywolf tower, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect all received an invitation to the Wind Clan for a meeting.</p><p>When they arrived at the wind race’s conference hall, they realized that the people sitting in the hall were not the wind race’s leader, but two strangers.</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch and elders were seated below, carefully accompanying them.</p><p>“Clan leader Feng, why have you called us here?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s master was the first to ask.</p><p>there’s no hurry. Let me introduce them to you. They’re from the Daluo heaven sect, the ancient sun Holy Land!</p><p>The clan leader of the Wind Clan pointed at the two people above.</p><p>what? ” the WAN clan leader and the Golden Crow clan leader’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect was a great emperor-level force with great strength that they could not compare with.</p><p>They quickly saluted the two people from the Daluo heaven sect, who nodded slightly.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ll get straight to the point. This time, I’ve brought all of you here for only one purpose-to kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>A middle-aged man from the Daluo heaven sect said coldly.</p><p>The hall suddenly fell silent!</p><p>After a while, the WAN family’s master said,” brother Luo, to be honest, we want to kill Lu Ming too. However, he has the protection of that old man from the Dayan elixir Palace. That old man is a great emperor. If we attack Lu Ming, I’m afraid that old man will kill us directly!</p><p>“That’s right. If it wasn’t for that old man from the Dayan elixir Hall, we would have destroyed Lu Ming long ago!”</p><p>The chief of the Golden Crow race said.</p><p>it doesn’t matter. This time, Emperor Tian Luo of the Daluo heaven sect will take action. The old man of the Dayan elixir Palace will naturally be dealt with by Emperor Tian Luo!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Daluo heaven sect said.</p><p>“Emperor tianluo will take action?”</p><p>The leaders of the WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, the Sirius tower, and other forces were all overjoyed.</p><p>However, they immediately looked worried because they remembered that Lu Ming still had the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming still has the celestial Thearch’s body. Although he was assassinated by the death god nation in the land of divine destiny, he did not use the celestial Thearch’s body. Some people speculate that there are many restrictions to his use of the celestial Thearch’s body, but we have to be careful!</p><p>The WAN clan’s clan head said.</p><p>The others also nodded. This was related to the survival of their entire force, so they had to be cautious.</p><p>we’ve already considered this. That’s why we need you to send someone to assassinate Lu Ming and test if he can control the celestial Thearch’s physical body!</p><p>One of the Daluo heaven sect disciples said.</p><p>“Should we go and test them?”</p><p>The WAN family’s master and the others changed their expressions.</p><p>They had sent people to test the waters. If Lu Ming could control the celestial Thearch’s physical body, the people they sent would be dead. If Lu Ming were to be enraged, all the major forces would be in danger.</p><p>“Don’t worry. We’re only testing him just in case. If Lu Ming can’t control the celestial Thearch’s physical body, we can kill him directly. If he can control it, you’ll only lose a few experts at most. When it’s necessary to do great things, a little loss is necessary!”</p><p>and let me tell you, we’re not the only ones who went against Lu Ming this time. The MU family, the land of divine destiny, has also sent a great emperor to deal with him. So, even if Lu Ming can control the celestial Thearch’s body, he’s still dead!</p><p>however, if this matter is spread out, it will be embarrassing for the MU family or the Daluo heaven sect. So, you need to send someone to assassinate them!</p><p>Another person from the Daluo heaven sect said with great confidence.</p><p>“The MU clan has also sent an expert to the divine land!”</p><p>The eyes of the WAN family’s master and the others flickered, and they finally made a decision.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll send people to ambush Lu Ming. It’ll be best if we can kill him directly!”</p><p>The leaders of the major forces all made their decisions.</p><p>Lu Ming was too much of a threat to them. They had to get rid of him.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming could not become an Emperor, he had to get rid of him as soon as possible. They would only be at ease after he was eliminated.</p><p>This time, with the help of the Masters of the Daluo heaven sect and the MU family, they could not miss such an opportunity..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
