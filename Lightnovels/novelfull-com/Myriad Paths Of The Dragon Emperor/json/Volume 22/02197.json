Bang!</p><p>The Yan clan’s true Emperor’s power of the world was actually broken by the little Daoist. Then, the legs and palms of the sixteen figures all landed on his face.</p><p>The Yan clan’s true Emperor let out a blood-curdling screech and followed in the footsteps of the LAN clan’s members. He was beaten to the ground, convulsing and unable to stand up.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>Many people looked at the little Daoist with their mouths agape.</p><p>This little Daoist’s strength was too terrifying. That was a true Emperor, and he had been defeated so easily.</p><p>Yan Xi’s face turned pale.</p><p>At this moment, the little Daoist looked at Yan Xi.</p><p>Yan Xi broke out in a cold sweat. She forced a smile that was uglier than a crying face and said,” “This brother, it’s a misunderstanding, it’s a misunderstanding. You’ve taken a fancy to LAN Yun’s treasure, so please go ahead, 1 won’t interfere!”</p><p>“Get lost, now this Lord also has his eyes on yours!”</p><p>The little Daoist sneered and rushed towards Yan Xi.</p><p>Then, there was another scream. The people Yan Xi had brought along and Yan Xi herself were also killed.</p><p>Then, the little Daoist began to plunder, taking away all the storage rings of the Yan family.</p><p>The most miserable were Yan Xi and LAN Yun. Their identities were not ordinary. They were the top heaven’s pride experts and were extremely rich. Even the clothes they wore, the things they wore on their heads, and the things they wore on their hands were all rare treasures.</p><p>Therefore, it was naturally taken by the little Daoist priest, under the beautiful name of safekeeping!</p><p>After that, Yan Xi and LAN Yun were stripped by the little Daoist until they were only left with their underpants.</p><p>The others were really covered in cold sweat. They were secretly glad that they didn’t offend the little Daoist. Otherwise, if they were stripped naked in public, it would definitely be a big joke.</p><p>Many people were mourning for LAN Yun and Yan Xi.</p><p>“Today’s harvest is not bad!”</p><p>After the little Daoist kept the items, he grinned and muttered.</p><p>Although he said it very softly, it was still heard by the others, and they all felt their teeth hurt.</p><p>The little Daoist’s gaze swept across the crowd. Then, he put his hands behind his back and put on the appearance of a peerless master, these people are too despicable. They forced others to be their test stones and even wanted to kill them in the end. That’s why they ended up like this. That’s why 1 say we should be kind!</p><p>Many people looked at him with disdain.</p><p>Kind?</p><p>You’re the most unkind one!</p><p>Of course, no one dared to say it out loud. They were only thinking about it in their hearts. Otherwise, they might end up like LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>Finally, the little Daoist looked at Lu Ming and said,” “Little brat, I don’t think you’re welcomed here. I think you’re a talented man, so why don’t you join me? 1’11 take you out of here and let you live a good life. How about it?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded without any hesitation.</p><p>“You’re so straightforward?”</p><p>The little Daoist was suspicious.</p><p>“It’s that straightforward, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then cupped his fists to Liu Hao and the rest. “Brother Liu, Lu Ming will take his leave!”</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>With his hands behind his back, the little Daoist stepped into the air and left the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming followed him. Soon, they were far away from the valley.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming sized up the little Daoist carefully. He looked at him from the beginning to the end and then from the end to the end.</p><p>“Hey, What are you looking at? Don’t tell me you have some special fetishes!”</p><p>The little Daoist felt uncomfortable from being stared at.</p><p>“Have we met before?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly asked.</p><p>The little Daoist’s eyelids twitched and he quickly shook his head,” “No, you’ve never seen me before. Who am 1? how can you meet me just because you want to?”</p><p>“Oh? Was it? You look very familiar to me, like an old friend!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>little guy, don’t think too much. It’s your fortune to meet me. It’s also a great opportunity for you. In the future, follow me and help me run errands. You’ll get some benefits!</p><p>The little Daoist’s expression turned serious. He placed his hands behind his back and stood straight, exuding the air of a peerless expert.</p><p>It was just that he looked too young and tender. He was only a teenager, and no matter how one looked at him, he did not have the demeanor of an expert.</p><p>“Then 1 have to thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and cupped his fists. Then, he suddenly asked,” “Dandan, How did you come to the heaven realm from the primordial realm?”</p><p>“What kind of person am I? It’s invincible throughout the ages, so it’s only natural that it knows about the other passageways …”</p><p>At first, the little Daoist was very proud of himself. However, he seemed to have realized something halfway through his sentence and suddenly stopped. He saw Lu Ming looking at him with a faint smile.</p><p>“You’re dandan indeed. You, this guy, actually dare to not recognize me when you see me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was very unfriendly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to trick me …”</p><p>The little Daoist gritted his teeth. To be more precise, he was angry.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had his suspicions when he first saw the little Daoist.</p><p>Although the little Daoist concealed his aura very well and he could not sense it at all, his character and style of doing things were too similar.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thought of dandan.</p><p>After the little Daoist had defeated LAN Yun and the rest, a series of events made Lu Ming even more certain that this fellow was dandan.</p><p>This also explained why the little Daoist was completely on Lu Ming’s side the moment he appeared. If it was someone he did not know, why would he be on Lu Ming’s side the moment he appeared?</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming left with dandan without any hesitation.</p><p>However, this guy wanted to show off in front of Lu Ming and was immediately exposed by Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>“I haven’t seen you for so many years, but your cultivation has grown so fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>He never thought that he would meet dandan here, and he was also overjoyed.</p><p>“Hmph, Who am 1? It’s the number one beast in history, the head of the top ten Battle Beasts, of course it’ll improve quickly. Unlike you, who hasn’t become a divine Emperor yet.”</p><p>Dandan cast a contemptuous glance at Lu Ming, feeling smug.</p><p>In the past, when he was following Lu Ming, his cultivation was often suppressed by Lu Ming. Now that his cultivation was far higher than Lu Ming’s, he immediately felt refreshed.</p><p>“Dandan, have you recovered your memory?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’s almost there. So, you can follow me in the future. I’ll bring you to all kinds of Forbidden Lands and all kinds of treasures. 1 guarantee that your cultivation will improve rapidly!</p><p>Dandan had a smug look.</p><p>“Why are you dressed like a little Daoist?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>I’ve always looked like this after I transformed. As for this Daoist robe, it’s convenient for me to take it with me. It’s beneficial for my movements!</p><p>Dandan chuckled.</p><p>A quack!</p><p>Two words popped up in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Dandan was dressed like this, and coupled with his style of doing things, he was a typical quack.</p><p>“By the way, How did you come to the heaven realm? I heard that a group of heaven’s favorites came to the primordial realm, but you’re not one of them. Furthermore, they’re all cultivating in seclusion!”</p><p>Dandan asked curiously..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
