The brilliant light suppressed the bow.</p><p>However, at this moment, the large bow emitted a ray of light that was like a light barrier. It covered itself and blocked the large words.</p><p>The bodies of the evil god race’s members began to glow with an even more intense purple light, which gushed into the ground continuously. The power of the formation grew even stronger, and it continued to glow with a dark light. Large, black characters appeared one after another, and they continued to rush toward the bow.</p><p>However, although the light shield around the bow kept shaking, it was not broken.</p><p>this bow still has its spirituality. It s definitely a Supreme divine bow!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. A fiery look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>After a moment, it was still ineffective. It did not break the light shield on the bow.</p><p>our formation is too far away from the bow. It can t display its full power. We have to get close to the bow and set up the formation. Only then will we be able to destroy the killing intent on the bow!</p><p>One of rhe evil god race members said.</p><p>that’s right. This is a treasure left behind from ancient times. Even after so many years, its spirituality still hasn’t completely disappeared. It’s definitely a treasure that can t be missed. Let’s do it!</p><p>The other member of the evil god race also spoke up.</p><p>Then, the evil god tribe members carefully approached the bow. When they were within 1000 meters of the bow, they started to set up the formation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the bow buzzed and emitted a bright light.</p><p>Then, a ray of light shot out from the bow like an arrow.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>One of the evil god tribe members was unable to put up any resistance before his head was pierced through by an arrow, resulting in his violent death.</p><p>“Increase the speed!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members roared.</p><p>The purple light on the bodies of the evil god race members became more and more intense. They increased their speed in setting up the formation, and rays of light entered the ground.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, the bow vibrated again, and another arrow was shot out, killing another member of the evil god race.</p><p>The remaining members of the evil god race were terrified. However, at this point, it was impossible for them to retreat. They could only grit their teeth and continue.</p><p>They increased their speed in setting up the formation.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>in the process of setting up the formation, the huge bow kept vibrating, and arrows were shot out. One after another, the evil god race members were killed, what a terrifying power! This is a killing intent that hasn’t dissipated yet!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were a little solemn.</p><p>He could tell that there was a wisp of killing intent left behind by the bow’s owner when he was alive. Any living creature that got close to the bow would be killed mercilessly.</p><p>This was also the reason why LAN Yun and the rest had asked Lu Ming to Scout the way. If the broken sword still had its own spirit, it would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>The evil god tribe was obviously trying to set up a formation to wipe out the killing intent on the bow.</p><p>in just a short moment, eight members of the evil god tribe had died under the bow.</p><p>And now, there were only nine evil god races left.</p><p>“Success! Retreat!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The remaining nine people retreated in a frenzy. However, at this moment, the bow vibrated and another arrow was shot out, aiming at one of the evil god race members.</p><p>“No…11</p><p>The evil god tribe member roared out in despair, filled with unwillingness.</p><p>He had already succeeded. He had already retreated, but at the last moment, an arrow was shot at him.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Without any suspense, this member of the evil god race was killed, and only eight members of the evil god race were left.</p><p>The remaining eight people retreated with astonishing speed. When they had retreated a certain distance, the large bow no longer emitted light and became silent.</p><p>The eight members of the evil god race all had expressions of lingering fear on their faces.</p><p>If they were unlucky, they would have been dead!</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>The eight of them looked at each other and then started to activate the array.</p><p>This time, the inner and outer layers of rhe formation were activated at the same time, forming ancient and mysterious characters that flew towards the big bow.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that this kind of large array should be one that the evil god tribe had.</p><p>The ancient characters flew towards the bow. The bow glowed and was covered by a layer of light.</p><p>But this time, the power of the ancient characters was obviously much stronger than before.</p><p>The large characters glowed and pressed down on the light shield like weapons.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The light shield trembled continuously and rippled as if it would collapse at any moment.</p><p>After a few minutes, rhe light shield could not hold on any longer. Like a bubble, it burst with a pop.</p><p>The huge words rushed towards the bow and covered it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the bow trembled and released a terrifying killing intent that filled the surroundings.</p><p>The words that covered the bow crumbled one by one.</p><p>However, more words would immediately cover it.</p><p>Every time the character crumbled, the killing intent on the bow would dim and weaken a little.</p><p>This was to use the power of the formation to obliterate the killing intent in the bow.</p><p>As time passed, the killing intent on the bow became weaker and weaker.</p><p>Half an hour later, the killing intent on the bow had completely disappeared.</p><p>“It’s a success, haha!”</p><p>One of the members of the evil god race laughed out loud, and the other members of the evil god race revealed looks of joy.</p><p>They stepped forward and approached the bow, but the bow didn’t react at all.</p><p>In the end, they neared the bow, and one of the evil god tribesmen stepped forward and grabbed the bow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The evil god Clansman grabbed the bow in his hand and tried to pull the bowstring. However, after pulling for a long time, there was no reaction at all. haha, it’s indeed a Supreme treasure. With our cultivation, we can’t open it at all!</p><p>The evil god tribe member laughed out loud, becoming even more excited.</p><p>If they brought such a valuable treasure back and handed it over, they would definitely be rewarded handsomely.</p><p>“Let me see! ”</p><p>The other member of the evil god race was extremely curious. He took the bow and tried to draw it, but it was to no avail.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“Three four-star illusionary emperors and five three-star illusionary emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Earlier on, when the evil god tribe was controlling the array, Lu Ming had already known their strength.</p><p>Among the evil god tribe, there were originally two five-star void emperors. However, they were too unlucky to have been lulled by the big bow. The strongest remaining was only a four-star void Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to take action and kill these evil god tribe members to snatch the big bow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the sky and approached the area where the evil god race was.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine breath technique but did not emit any aura. The other party did not sense it at all and continued to look at the big bow.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming swooped down like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>As he rushed down, a combat sword was condensed in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>This was a divine ability, the sword of death!</p><p>“Not good, there’s someone!”</p><p>The members of the evil god tribe had also noticed Lu Ming. They roared and their bodies were covered in purple light.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and slashed his sword at a four-star illusionary Emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
