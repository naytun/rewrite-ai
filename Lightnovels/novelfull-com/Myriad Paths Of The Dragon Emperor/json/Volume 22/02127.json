Yuan Xin</h1><p>Chapter 2127: Lu Ming vs. Yuan Xin</p><p>Translator: 549690339</p><p>“Tianming is number one in the world, no one can rival him!”</p><p>the ranking is pretty much clear. Tianming is first and Yuan Xin is second. It’s a pity that Lu Ming is only an Emperor-to-be. If he becomes an Emperor, he might be able to compete with Tianming!</p><p>there aren’t so many ‘if s’. Tianming is ahead by one step and he will only become stronger in the future. I’m afraid Lu Ming will never be Tianming’s match!</p><p>The crowd discussed. In the end, someone who was hostile to Lu Ming spoke up and deliberately belittled Lu Ming, causing Lu Xiangxiang, Pao Pao and the others to glare at him.</p><p>In the seventh round, after the battle between Tianming and Yuan Xin, the following battles were not too surprising. Those who were expected to win had all won.</p><p>Lu Ming had also won. He had no conscience in this battle.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk dawdled for a long time. After exchanging a few moves with Lu Ming, he directly admitted defeat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re a freak. I thought that 1 could suppress you after so many years. 1 didn’t expect that I’m still not your match!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk had a bitter expression.</p><p>“Hey, what are you saying? What do you mean by abnormal? this is my talent, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at him.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>Wu Liang stopped talking and stepped aside.</p><p>After the seventh round ended, the white-haired old man let everyone rest for three days. They would fight again after three days.</p><p>This was because some people, like Yuan Xin, were injured, which would affect their combat strength.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye, and everyone had recovered to their peak states.</p><p>“Lu Ming, against Yuan Xin!”</p><p>As soon as the eighth round began, the white-haired old man released the most important battle.</p><p>To be honest, everyone was looking forward to this match.</p><p>This was because this was a battle between the two sons of Chaos, and it was also a battle between the second and third place.</p><p>Most of them thought that Lu Ming would not be Yuan Xin’s match because the abilities that Yuan Xin had displayed previously were too shocking.</p><p>But after all, it was a battle between two Sons of Chaos, which was a rare sight.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes were filled with a fiery light as she stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming also stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, I’ll make you lose miserably!”</p><p>Yuan Xin glared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but 1 have to tell you something. No one has ever been able to surpass me after being defeated by me, not even you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>What did Lu Ming mean by this? Could it be that Lu Ming had defeated Yuan Xin in the past? How was this possible?</p><p>Very quickly, news spread that Lu Ming and Yuan Xin had a battle during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment. Yuan Xin had lost that battle.</p><p>Everyone was surprised that such a thing had happened. It seemed that the two sons of Chaos had a grudge against each other.</p><p>back then, I was only suppressed. If 1 wasn’t suppressed, 1 would have suppressed you with a flip of my hand!</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the chaos Scripture. You’re not qualified to wield it!” Yuan Xin’s face was cold.</p><p>“If I don’t have the right, do you?”</p><p>“You want the chaos Scripture? sure. Why don’t we make a bet?” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What are we betting on?”</p><p>Yuan Xin said coldly.</p><p>let’s bet on this battle. If I lose, I’ll give you the chaos Scripture. If you lose, you’ll listen to me for the rest of your life. How about it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I won’t bet with you!”</p><p>Yuan Xin said coldly.</p><p>“You dare not? Are you afraid of losing?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I won’t lose. I want the chaos Scripture. I’ll just defeat you and take it from you!</p><p>Yuan Xin was very confident. After he finished speaking, he did not say anything else and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of his body, and the Laws of Chaos and another law permeated the air.</p><p>It was a King path law, but it wasn’t very mature yet. However, it still strengthened Yuan Xin’s combat strength.</p><p>“Chaos Divine fist!”</p><p>Yuan Xin made his move. He swung his fists continuously, and the void rumbled. With every punch he threw, a huge mountain would form, crushing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a mountain formed from the Laws of Chaos, and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming moved as well. Three types of laws burst out and went against the flow. He used the chaos Divine palm and struck out several times in a row.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Each palm could shatter a mountain. The mountains evolved from the Laws of Chaos exploded in the air.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>After crushing a few mountains, Lu Ming cast the chaos finger of tribulation again. A huge chaos finger of tribulation formed and crushed toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>Yuan Xin threw a few punches and destroyed the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived. He struck out with the chaos Divine palm in succession, and in an instant, he had struck out hundreds of palms.</p><p>Yuan Xin waved his fist and fought with Lu Ming.</p><p>The two figures moved unhindered as they engaged in a great battle. For a time, it was difficult to determine the victor.</p><p>the Laws of Chaos pervaded the entire stage.</p><p>Yuan Xin was very strong. He was a peak two-star illusionary Emperor. In terms of cultivation, he was much stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body and Saint energy had been tempered five times. Moreover, he had two ultimate maxims and three king path maxims. With the fusion of the three maxims, he had completely made up for the lack of cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming is really strong. He can actually compete with Yuan Xin. However, Yuan Xin still has a secret skill that he hasn’t used yet. Lu Ming is destined to lose!</p><p>Someone spoke up and acknowledged Lu Ming’s combat strength. However, he felt that Lu Ming would still lose.</p><p>yuanxin, bring out your strongest combat power. This is not enough!</p><p>Lu Ming said in the middle of the battle.</p><p>“Since you want to experience it, I’ll crush you!”</p><p>“Chaotic divine body!”</p><p>Yuan Xin let out a long roar, and the Laws of Chaos boiled. His body seemed to have turned into a chaos stone.</p><p>After performing this secret skill, Yuan Xin’s combat strength increased greatly. He threw a punch and clashed with Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming felt his arm go numb and he could not help but take five to six steps back.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yuan Xin took advantage of the situation to pursue and attack. She kept punching out with both fists, forcing Lu Ming to retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re no match for me. Hand over the chaos Scripture!”</p><p>Yuan Xin shouted, and his attacks were wild.</p><p>“Why are you so anxious? It seems that against you, three types of laws are still a bit lacking. Then four types of laws it is!”</p><p>As he spoke, another river of laws flowed out of Lu Ming’s body and fused with the three types of laws from before.</p><p>The next moment, a four-colored river of laws appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>After merging with one more law, Lu Ming’s combat strength increased greatly. He struck out with his palm and exchanged a blow with Yuan Xin. Both of their bodies trembled violently and they retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took two steps back, while Yuan Xin took four steps back, four types of laws. Lu Ming has actually comprehended four types of laws! my God, it’s the law of devouring. Two Supreme laws and two King path laws. This is really heaven-defying!</p><p>“This is too terrifying!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, and someone shouted.</p><p>The main reason was that it was too shocking. Previously, Lu Ming had not used his full strength and had held back.</p><p>Not only had he mastered two ultimate maxims, but he had also comprehended two other King path maxims, both of which had been perfected. How old was Lu Ming? how did he cultivate?</p><p>Many people couldn’t stay calm, and even many emperors were dumbfounded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
