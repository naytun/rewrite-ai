His essence Qi was surging and his blood Qi was like a furnace. Every muscle was filled with explosive power.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and a Dragon’s Roar came from his body. Blood Qi gushed out from every pore of his body like flames. The strange energy that covered his body turned into clouds and smoke in an instant.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The young man who mastered the law of curses had a drastic change of expression. He was about to cast another curse technique to deal with Lu Ming. “Go down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was a punch of pure physical strength. This punch was like a meteorite that rushed into the sea. The space exploded like the sea water, forming circles of ripples that crushed towards the opponent.</p><p>With a muffled groan, his body was sent flying out of the fighting ring, coughing up blood.</p><p>Lu Ming had held back. Otherwise, he would have killed the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming won easily.</p><p>However, even though he had instantly killed his opponent, he did not attract too much attention.</p><p>Although the law of curses was strange and profound, the young man was only an Emperor-to-be. Anyone who had reached the Martial Emperor realm could kill him in one move.</p><p>Humph, you only defeated an Emperor-to-be. I really hope you can meet me!</p><p>Mu yang sneered, his eyes even colder.</p><p>He really hoped that he could meet Lu Ming and then kill him to wash away the shame.</p><p>Lu Ming initially thought that his stone platform would retreat. He did not expect that his stone platform did not retreat. Instead, it moved and met another stone platform.</p><p>He continued to fight!</p><p>Many people were stunned for a moment, and their expressions turned grave.</p><p>This was the first time someone had fought in succession, and they couldn’t help but be wary.</p><p>The stone platform’s operation seemed to indicate that anything was possible. They had to conserve their energy for the upcoming matches. Otherwise, it would be disadvantageous for them if they were to be continuously challenged.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s opponent was a short-haired teenager. His eyes were sharp and he was very valiant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the other party immediately exploded with a terrifying aura. The aura brought about a strong wind that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A martial Supreme!</p><p>His opponent was a Martial Emperor with a King body that had stepped into the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Mu Yang’s eyes lit up. A Martial Emperor with a King physique would most likely be able to test Lu Ming’s strength.</p><p>Not only Muyang, but some of the people from the southern Warzone were also shocked.</p><p>Two years ago, Lu Ming was so powerful that he could defeat Muyang. He was known as a seeded elite. Many people wanted to know what realm he had reached two years later.</p><p>“Burial earth, bury me!”</p><p>The other party made his move. His body moved sideways and in the process of moving, his body seemed to have turned into a stone tablet, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This stone tablet was extremely similar to a gravestone!</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and punched the tombstone. The tombstone shook and flew out, turning into a human figure.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The short-haired teenager roared and attacked again. This time, his body glowed with a layer of black light. With a wave of his hand, tombstones appeared one after another and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“The law of burial earth!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. Today, he had seen some wonderful laws.</p><p>The law of burial earth could bury everything and kill them. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>The short-haired teenager used the law of burial ground to turn it into a tombstone, intending to bury Lu Ming.</p><p>The short-haired youth had reached the great emperor realm and was much stronger than the prodigies who had mastered the laws of curses.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and punched continuously, shattering the tombstones in the air.</p><p>In the end, the short-haired teenager’s attack reached its peak. A huge tomb appeared in the sky, trying to bury Lu Ming.</p><p>The power was extremely terrifying. If someone of the same rank was buried in the tomb, it would be very difficult to come out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body erupted with an even more shocking aura, and the death law spread out.</p><p>This caused the other heaven’s favorites to be stunned.</p><p>The children of heaven were all extraordinary and worthy of attention. They were their opponents to enter the top ten.</p><p>The death Qi on Lu Ming’s body became thicker and thicker. In the end, it turned into a long river that surrounded his body.</p><p>laws form a River. He hasn’t become an Emperor yet. He’s only a quasi Emperor!</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was nothing to be afraid of. He was destined to be a foil.</p><p>hehe, I’ve been in that small world for two years, but I’m still an Emperor-to-be. It seems that my talent is really not good enough!</p><p>Mu yang was overjoyed and couldn’t help but sneer.</p><p>Hmph, even if his cultivation is low, he will still abuse you. Have you forgotten what happened two years ago? ”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang was indignant and taunted him.</p><p>Although she did not recognize Lu Ming, Lu Ming had helped them two years ago. She had a good impression of Lu Ming. When she saw Muyang mocking Lu Ming, she also ridiculed him.</p><p>Muyang’s face turned ugly at the mention of being abused, that was then and this is now. He does have some strength, but if he meets me now, only death awaits him. 1’11 make him die a terrible death!</p><p>one step ahead, one step ahead. I’ve already become an Emperor while he’s still an Emperor-to-be. He’ll never be my opponent!</p><p>Mu yang sneered, full of confidence.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang snorted coldly and did not say anything.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the short-haired teenager were fighting again.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the death rule and his combat strength increased greatly.</p><p>He used death’s eye, and it was as if combat weapons were flying out of his eyes, destroying the enemy’s tomb.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming charged forward like a wild dragon, piercing through his opponent’s defense and sending the short-haired young man flying out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had won this round.</p><p>did you see that? even if he’s not an Emperor yet, he can still defeat a Martial Emperor!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had won, Lu Xiangxiang was overjoyed and looked at Mu yang with ridicule.</p><p>it’s just defeating a King body. It’s nothing.</p><p>Mu yang smiled faintly.</p><p>Even though he said that, he felt a little heavy in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability to defeat a Martial Emperor with a King body was enough to prove how terrifying he was.</p><p>However, he was still confident that he could beat Lu Ming.</p><p>There was still a huge difference between the king physique and the Son of God.</p><p>After the battle, Lu Ming’s stone platform retreated.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day passed.</p><p>Now, there were only half of the original three hundred and twenty stone platforms left. Half of the people had been eliminated.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang met a terrifying opponent.</p><p>Although Luo Xiang had already become a martial Supreme, his opponent had also become a martial Supreme this time. Moreover, he was a Son of God.</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle.</p><p>Although Luo Xiang had used all his strength and displayed the law of speed to the extreme, it was useless. The other party had directly broken his law of speed with terrifying strength and defeated Luo Xiang in a crushing manner.</p><p>However, the other party had no enmity with Luo Xiang, so he only injured him, not killed him.</p><p>The competition after that was getting more and more brutal.</p><p>This was because almost all of the Emperor-to-be realm experts had been eliminated. Only a few of them remained. Those who remained had almost all entered the Martial Emperor realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
