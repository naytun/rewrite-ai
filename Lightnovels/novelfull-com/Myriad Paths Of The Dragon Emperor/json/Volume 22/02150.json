Each and every one of them was dressed like emperors.</p><p>It seemed that although many things had happened in Mount Yuan, the Azure continent, cloud continent, and Emperor continent were not affected at all, because it was simply too remote.</p><p>At this moment, two figures were running in Dragon God Valley, heading towards the former Cloud Dragon Valley. These two people were Lu Ming’s two senior brothers.</p><p>Second senior brother Longyuan mountain and third senior brother yang tianzong.</p><p>The two of them arrived at Cloud Dragon Valley and entered a cave residence before closing the stone door.</p><p>senior brother, our luck is pretty good this time. We’ve obtained two mystical stones. After refining them, our cultivation will definitely improve. We’ll each get one!</p><p>Yang tianzong took out two silver stones. On the surface of the stones, there were strange patterns that looked very mysterious.</p><p>Junior Brother, you should use these two mystical stones. Your talent is higher than mine, so it’ll be a waste if 1 use them to improve my cultivation!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>senior brother, how can we do that? the two of us obtained the mystical stones together, so it’s only right that we each get one. Senior brother, you can take it!</p><p>Yang tianzong passed a mystical stone to Longyuan mountain.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone door of the cave dwelling let out a violent roar. Someone was bombarding the stone door.</p><p>Yang tianzong and long Yuanshan’s expressions changed. Yang tianzong kept the runic stone.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The stone door shook and then exploded with a bang. A few figures walked in from outside.</p><p>There were three people in total, two middle-aged and one old man.</p><p>The three of them looked at Longyuan mountain coldly. Yang tianzong glanced at them and said,” “You two, hand over the runic stones!”</p><p>“What mystical stone? Elder, are you all mistaken?”</p><p>Longyuan Shan’s expression changed slightly before he smiled apologetically, you still want to quibble? it’s not just the two of you who went to the bottom of the sea. Someone saw you obtain the mystical stones. Quickly hand them over. Otherwise, you know the consequences!</p><p>The old man sneered.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong roared in their hearts.</p><p>ever since they were controlled by evil spirit, all their resources had been taken away. Even if they obtained any resources later, as long as evil spirit found out, they would take them.</p><p>This caused their cultivation to become extremely slow.</p><p>All these years, their cultivation had not improved much. The main reason was that all their resources had been taken away. They only relied on absorbing the heaven Earth Yuan Qi to cultivate slowly, which was very slow.</p><p>And some time ago, they had been sent to the sea to carry out a mission. By chance, they had obtained two mystical stones.</p><p>The mystical rock was a rare natural treasure. After refining it, it could greatly increase one’s cultivation level. It was also of great help to one’s comprehension of nomological laws.</p><p>As soon as they returned, they planned to refine it immediately. They were afraid that evil spirit would find out and take the mystical stone away.</p><p>They didn’t expect that the other party would hear the news and rush over so quickly just as they returned.</p><p>“Still not handing it over, do you want to die?”</p><p>Seeing the two hesitating, the old man’s face darkened.</p><p>elder, we’re working for evil spirit, but we’re not their slaves. We have the right to obtain our own treasures to cultivate. What you’re doing is too much!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Hahaha, too much? Let me tell you, you’re evil Spirit’s slaves. You’re going to work for evil spirit with all your heart. Don’t even think about getting your own cultivation resources, do you understand?”</p><p>The old man laughed out loud, and the other two middle-aged men also laughed wildly.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yang tianzong roared and his eyes were filled with ferocity.</p><p>“What are you doing? Are you trying to rebel? As long as I report this, you’ll wish you were dead. Don’t forget, there’s a restriction in your soul!”</p><p>The old man was fearless.</p><p>“Junior Brother, don’t act rashly!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain held yang tianzong down, preventing him from acting rashly.</p><p>Their souls had been sealed by evil Spirit’s powerhouses. Their lives were completely under the other party’s control. If they acted rashly, they would only die.</p><p>Yang tianzong was helpless and could only bear with it.</p><p>a slave will always be a slave, and they should have the responsibility of being a slave. Now, hand over the mystical stones, kneel down, and admit your mistakes. I can let bygones be bygones. Hurry up!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“What? You want us to kneel?”</p><p>Yang tianzong was furious and his eyes were red. Even Longyuan mountain was the same.</p><p>This was bullying.</p><p>kneeling down is already giving you a way out. Hurry up, hurry up, 1 don’t have that much time to spend with you!</p><p>The old man shouted.</p><p>“Since you’re in such a hurry, 1’11 send you on your way!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out from outside the cave.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Hearing this voice, Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong trembled and their eyes revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>They were all too familiar with this voice.</p><p>The old man’s eyes turned cold and filled with cold killing intent. He turned around and shouted,” “Which blind person is courting death!”</p><p>Then, everyone saw a young man and woman walk into the cave.</p><p>The man looked to be in his twenties. He was tall and straight, his eyes were like stars, and he had an indescribable bearing.</p><p>The woman looked like she was in her twenties. She wore a snow-white dress and looked like a fairy from a painting.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, it’s really you!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>The ones who entered were naturally Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Just now, the two of them had checked outside before entering Dragon God Valley and heading towards Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s sharp hearing, he heard the commotion the moment he entered Cloud Dragon Valley. He was instantly enraged.</p><p>“Junior Brother? You’re from Dragon God Valley? I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>The old man said in a deep voice.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and walked towards Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong. He cupped his fists and said,”Two senior brothers, long time no see!” “Little Junior Brother, why are you back? you …”</p><p>When Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong saw Lu Ming, they were both happy and worried.</p><p>They did not know if Lu Ming had any backing. If he showed up like this and did not have any backing, it would be troublesome.</p><p>They had learned from the cloud Dragon Valley master that Lu Ming had escaped and would seek help. They wondered if he had invited any experts.</p><p>kid, it seems like you’re the fish that escaped the net back then. Hahaha, you actually still dare to show yourself. You’re really looking for death!</p><p>On second thought, the old man knew that Lu Ming was not caught back then.</p><p>But since he had already escaped, it was really stupid to show his face like this.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at the old man and the two burly men.”Kneel down and commit suicide!”</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>The old man and the two burly men thought they had heard wrong.</p><p>This kid actually asked them to kneel down and commit suicide? Was he crazy?</p><p>This was evil Spirit’s territory, and their own cultivation was extremely high. This kid didn’t look very old, but he actually asked them to kneel and commit suicide. His arrogant look made them want to laugh.</p><p>They felt that this was the biggest joke in the world.</p><p>But in the next moment, they could no longer laugh.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s body suddenly burst out with a terrifying aura. The terrifying pressure was like hundreds of mountains, pressing down on them. Plop! Plop! Plop!</p><p>The three of them knelt down..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
