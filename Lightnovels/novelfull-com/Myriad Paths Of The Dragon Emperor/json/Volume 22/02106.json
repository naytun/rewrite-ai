His cold and arrogant face darkened, thinking that Lu Ming had underestimated him.</p><p>kid, 1 didn’t use my true strength just now. Do you think you can compete with me? 1’11 use my full strength now and see how many moves you can block!</p><p>The biack-haired youth said coldly, his aura even more oppressive.</p><p>At this moment, the purple-haired young man spoke,” Junior Brother, don’t do anything. It’s almost time!</p><p>The black-haired young man’s expression changed. He cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and said,” “I’ll let you go this time!”</p><p>Then, he turned around and walked into a cave with the purple-haired young man.</p><p>There was a cave in the depths of the valley.</p><p>It seemed that the two young men had been waiting outside the cave for something.</p><p>“It seems like there’s some kind of treasure in this cave!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and considered for a moment. In the end, he did not enter.</p><p>The two young men were obviously peerless talents in the heaven realm. Lu Ming did not want to offend them for no reason.</p><p>“Let’s leave first and look elsewhere!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and then turned to leave the valley.</p><p>At this moment, he found it hard to calm down. It seemed that this place was not simple. There were actually heaven realm geniuses here.</p><p>Could it be that this corner of the world wasn’t taken out by a primordial realm expert, but by a heaven realm expert?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was full of thoughts.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming walked for another two days before he finally discovered a strange land in a Mountain Valley.</p><p>Here, there was a spring that looked like a demonic pool or a spiritual pool. Inside it, innate Qi of origin was constantly emitted, and the energy was shockingly high.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He planned to let the celestial Thearch’s body absorb the energy here. As long as the energy in the celestial Thearch’s body reached a certain level, he would be able to control it. He would not have so many scruples when he did things.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out the celestial Thearch’s physical body and began to absorb the energy here by using the technique to control the physical body of heaven and earth.</p><p>This was the connate Qi of origin, and the energy here was frighteningly abundant. As soon as Lu Ming circulated the technique to control the celestial Thearch’s body, rich energy from all directions gathered toward the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>Moreover, the quality of the energy here was also very high. The energy storage of the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body was rapidly increasing.</p><p>He could feel the energy in the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body increasing and strengthening at all times.</p><p>In just a few days, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body’s energy had reached ten percent.</p><p>Lu Ming could control it when it reached 10%.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. However, he did not stop. He continued to control the celestial Thearch’s physical body and absorbed the energy frantically.</p><p>Since the energy here was so dense, he should absorb more.</p><p>The more energy it stored, the more powerful the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body would be.</p><p>A month later, the energy here had almost dried up. It had been completely absorbed, and the energy in the celestial Thearch’s body had reached a shocking thirty-six percent.</p><p>One had to know that the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body had only stored 16% of its energy previously.</p><p>Thirty-six percent, the power was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“It would be great if 1 could completely replenish the energy of the heaven and earth in my body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was tempted.</p><p>If the energy in the celestial Emperor’s body could reach 100%, he would be able to do whatever he wanted in this era where there were no celestial emperors.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion. He set off immediately to look for other similar spring sources.</p><p>Unfortunately, this kind of spring eye was extremely rare. Lu Ming searched for a few days in a row but could not find it.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give up. He searched for a few more days, more than ten days in a row, but to no avail. Lu Ming finally gave up.</p><p>Time was precious here and he could not afford to waste it. Lu Ming began to prepare to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>He found a hidden place and sat down cross-legged to adjust his state.</p><p>A few days later, he was at his peak. His essence, energy, and spirit were in one. Lu Ming began to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>To break through to the martial sovereign realm, one had to use the Saint heart as the core and the laws as the heart to develop a small world.</p><p>The laws of a world were the foundation.</p><p>With the laws, this world could be continuously perfected.</p><p>Therefore, the first step was to use the laws to form the world core in the Saint heart.</p><p>Then, he would combine the world core and the Saint heart to evolve the world.</p><p>It was like the creation of the world.</p><p>An ordinary person’s breakthrough would use a type of nomoiogical law as the core to evolve the world core. After breaking through to the martial Supreme realm, one would comprehend other nomoiogical laws and add them into a small world. The more nomoiogical laws one added, the more perfect the small world would be.</p><p>However, since Lu Ming controlled five types of laws, he would have to combine the five types of laws to evolve the world core.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to succeed if he were to evolve one type of law.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He controlled the five types of laws and infused them into his Saint heart. He began to evolve the world core.</p><p>However, at this moment, his body trembled violently. He felt as if his Saint heart was about to explode. Even his body was about to be torn apart by a wave of energy.</p><p>He quickly stopped and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was ugly.</p><p>When he broke through just now, the five laws entered his Saint heart and collided with each other, producing a terrifying force that almost burst his Saint heart and tore his body apart.</p><p>could it be that those below the martial Supreme realm have cultivated many laws and can’t break through to the divine realm?”</p><p>“No, I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Lu Ming began to regulate his breathing and heal his injured body. After a few days, his injuries had recovered and he tried to break through to the Martial Emperor realm again. However, he still failed.</p><p>impossible! I’ll try to evolve the world core with a type of nomoiogical law!</p><p>Lu Ming was indignant and decided to change his strategy.</p><p>But he still failed.</p><p>This was because the five types of laws would affect everything. When he controlled one type of law to evolve in the Saint heart, four of the laws actually entered automatically. He could not control it even if he wanted to and injured Lu Ming again.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled in a low voice. He was extremely unwilling to accept this. If he could not break through to the divine Emperor realm, it would be a huge blow to him.</p><p>“I won’t. Maybe my cultivation level isn’t high enough and I need to settle down. There, there might be other ways. 1 can definitely vindicate my Dao and become an Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and took a deep breath to calm himself down.</p><p>Perhaps it was not the time to break through to the Emperor realm yet. He would have to wait for a while.</p><p>However, Lu Ming naturally did not dare to comprehend new laws now. The more laws there were, the more difficult it would be to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>there’s still some time left. Why don’t i comprehend the use of nomoiogical laws? i control five types of nomoiogical laws. If I can create a corresponding magical power Technique, its power will definitely soar!</p><p>Lu Ming put aside the matter of breaking the monarch and began to consider the problem of his own combat strength.</p><p>Now, his divine power techniques were all divine power techniques with a single law, such as the chaos Divine palm, the chaos tribulation finger, the eye of death, and the three scrolls of the array Dao.</p><p>Furthermore, the so-called law fusion was merely a crude fusion of the laws to increase their power.</p><p>This was the crudest way of using the laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
