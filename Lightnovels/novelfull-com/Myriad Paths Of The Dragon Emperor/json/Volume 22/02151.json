In Lu Ming’s eyes, they were no different from ants. He had only released a trace of his aura and the three of them were forced to their knees.</p><p>“All, Who are you?”</p><p>The old man used all his strength and struggled madly, but it was useless. The space seemed to have frozen, and the terrifying pressure seemed to be about to crush his body.</p><p>He was terrified!</p><p>He finally understood that this young man’s cultivation was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Just based on her aura, she was able to force him to kneel on the ground, unable to move. What cultivation level did she have?</p><p>In his impression, even an ordinary lower-tier absolute Saint couldn’t do it unless he was stronger.</p><p>Could this young man be above the initial absolute Saint realm?</p><p>Thinking of this, he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Lu Ming, a disciple of the Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming answered calmly.</p><p>ah, let us go. The entire Dragon God Valley is under our control. If you don’t let us go, you are seeking death. Not only you, but the entire Dragon God Valley must die!</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>He deliberately raised his voice to alert the others. Unfortunately, Lu Ming had already set up a wave of energy at the entrance of the cave abode. The movements here could not be transmitted out at all.</p><p>Qianqian, this time, your evil spirit cult will be completely annihilated!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His killing intent was like a knife.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The old man and the two burly men shouted in fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with the light of death. The three of them were instantly enveloped by the light of death. Then, they turned into ashes and dissipated.</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong sighed. After not seeing each other for so many years, it seemed like their Little Junior Brother had become even stronger and had reached a height that they could not reach.</p><p>The elder had the cultivation of the great sage upper tier, but he could not resist at all in Lu Ming’s hands. He was killed directly, and Lu Ming had not made a move since the beginning.</p><p>This kind of method made them feel somewhat inconceivable.</p><p>Little Junior Brother, you should leave quickly. If you kill them, evil spirit will find out very soon. By then, they’ll send experts over and we’ll be in big trouble!</p><p>At this moment, Longyuan Shan thought of something and said with a serious expression.</p><p>second senior brother, third senior brother, I’ve come back to save you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Save us?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were stunned for a moment before they revealed a look of joy and said,” “Little Junior Brother, could it be that you’ve already called for reinforcements from ancient Moon Holy Land?”</p><p>They thought that since Lu Ming was so confident, he must have invited reinforcements.</p><p>“Reinforcements? It can be considered so!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and asked,’Oh right, where is master? And where are the rest of the people from Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>Little Junior Brother, master is at the original Tianyu demonic sect. In fact, more than half of the people in Dragon God Valley are there. Most of the people from the other sects in the Azure region are also there, doing hard labor to refine a kind of demonic pill for evil spirit!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>the demonic pill in the sanctuary can help evil Spirit’s disciples improve their cultivation. Damn evil spirit, they’re treating us like slaves!</p><p>Yang tianzong said unhappily.</p><p>“They’re all in the Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>A murderous intent flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he continued,” “Second senior brother, third senior brother, let me first break the seal in your souls!”</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, it would not be too difficult for him to remove the restrictions in their souls.</p><p>“Break the restrictive spell? No, as soon as you break our restriction, evil Spirit’s people who set it up will immediately find out, and the others will be in danger!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan quickly said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. This was indeed very troublesome.</p><p>Everyone’s soul had been set up with a restriction. Their life and death could be decided by the other party with a single thought. This problem had to be resolved. Otherwise, no matter how strong Lu Ming’s cultivation was, he would not be able to move freely.</p><p>senior brothers,” he asked,” do you know how many people evil spirit has set up the restriction and where they are? ”</p><p>from what I know, there’s only one person in evil spirit who set up the restriction, and this person is also in the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Only one person!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>If there was only one person, then it would be easy.</p><p>senior brother, let’s go to the Tian Yu demon sect and kill the person who set up the restriction!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>wait a minute, Junior Brother. Don’t act rashly. The person who set up the restriction is in the Emperor-to-be realm. Moreover, there’s a Dharma King from evil spirit in the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>Longyuan Shan quickly said.</p><p>The Shakyamuni of evil spirit were all at the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>If they went over like this, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>it’s fine. He’s just a Dharma King. There’s nothing to worry about!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Junior Brother, did you really get reinforcements from ancient Moon Holy Land? can they suppress a Martial Emperor? ”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were overjoyed.</p><p>it’s enough to kill a martial Supreme. Don’t worry, senior brothers. You just have to bring me to the person who set up the restriction. That’ll do!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, in that case, let’s go!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain made up his mind.</p><p>“Two senior brothers, please wait for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left the cave abode.</p><p>In less than a minute, Lu Ming had returned.</p><p>He had just walked around Dragon God Valley and killed all the evil spirit cultivators above the Saint realm who were stationed there.</p><p>In this way, the person who set up the restriction would be killed, and the Dragon God Valley people’s restrictions would be released. They could then take advantage of the situation to defeat the evil spirit people.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a wave of energy swept Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong up. They left the cave abode and soared into the sky, flying towards the Tian Yu demon sect at an extreme speed.</p><p>“This speed…”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was too shocking. It was beyond their imagination. He was much faster than many absolute Saints they had seen.</p><p>Not long after, the vast stretch of demon mountain could be seen from afar.</p><p>In the Tian Yu demonic sect, on the large demonic mountain, one could occasionally see human figures flashing.</p><p>“Junior Brother, where are the reinforcements you’ve invited?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain asked.</p><p>Yang tianzong was also very curious. They had already arrived at the Tian Yu demon sect but they did not see anyone else. From the beginning to the end, there were only a few of them.</p><p>“Qiuyue, make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded.</p><p>“All? Her? “Junior Brother, you can’t do this. The evil spirit cult’s discipline King is in charge here. The evil spirit cult’s discipline King is an existence at the Martial Emperor realm. You’ll only harm her if you ask this little girl to attack</p><p>Longyuan mountain quickly stopped him.</p><p>Before this, Qiu Yue had been following Lu Ming obediently. Moreover, she was so young. They did not even think about how strong Qiu Yue’s cultivation was.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually asked Qiu Yue to make a move. Was he not sending Qiu Yue to her death?</p><p>“Don’t worry, you two!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled and stepped out, appearing above the demon mountains.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura burst out from Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>This was Emperor pressure, vast and boundless, like the vast ocean, unfathomable.</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were stunned..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
