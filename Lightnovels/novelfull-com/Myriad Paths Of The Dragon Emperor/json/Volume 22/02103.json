It was a jaw-dropping sight.</p><p>Where did this path come from, or rather, where did it lead to?</p><p>Was the so-called opportunity related to this path?</p><p>Everyone looked over carefully and found that this road had an end. At the end of the road, there was a door of light. They didn’t know where the door of light LED to.</p><p>“Everyone, now, let me tell you what the opportunity is.”</p><p>At this moment, a white-haired elder stepped out of the sky. He was obviously a great emperor, and a very powerful one at that.</p><p>the end of this path leads to a corner of the world. Why is it called a corner of the world? that’s because that corner of the world was separated from the primordial realm when it was first created. To this day, it still retains its original appearance!</p><p>the nomological laws there are extremely clear and the connate Origin Energy is rich. Whether it’s cultivating the nomological system or the primordial system, one’s cultivation speed will be shockingly fast there!</p><p>The white-haired Emperor said.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>It was actually a corner of the primordial realm’s world at the beginning of its creation, and it still retained the appearance of the primordial realm at the beginning of its creation. This was definitely an unimaginable opportunity for cultivation.</p><p>This was a great opportunity.</p><p>Countless people, including the martial sovereigns, were looking at him with burning eyes.</p><p>When one cultivated to the Martial Emperor realm, one had to evolve a small world.</p><p>Entering that corner of the primordial realm’s newly-formed world would definitely be a great improvement and advancement for developing a small world.</p><p>No wonder it was said that those who entered had a high chance of breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>this corner of the world was obtained by a powerful figure from the void. This time, it will be used as a reward for the chosen who pass the selection!</p><p>however, this corner of the world is not big after all. Moreover, it has been around for too long. For those below the martial Supreme realm or low-level void Supreme realm, it is very useful. If one’s cultivation is higher, it will not be of much use!</p><p>The white-haired elder’s explanation made many Martial Emperor powerhouses sigh.</p><p>go on in. You only have two years in there. After two years, that Almighty will send you out. How much you can gain in there will depend on you!</p><p>“The battle of the ten lands will only truly begin in two years!”</p><p>The white-haired Emperor announced.</p><p>Two years. They had two years.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He must make good use of these two years.</p><p>now, let’s set off. We’ll follow this ancient path and step on it!</p><p>The white-haired Emperor said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the white-haired Emperor finished speaking, one figure after another stepped onto the ancient road and followed it up.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Qiu Yue, Lu Xiangxiang, and the others also stepped onto the ancient road.</p><p>The star River, Yuan Xin, Mu yang, and the others all stepped on the ancient road one by one, heading into the depths of the sky.</p><p>The person in front had already reached the end. He stepped into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>Countless people were envious.</p><p>Especially those Young heaven’s favorites, their eyes were burning with passion but also helpless.</p><p>This was a great opportunity. They knew that this batch of 320 people would definitely be stronger in two years.</p><p>The gap between them and these people would be further widened.</p><p>The strong were always strong!</p><p>However, no one dared to sneak in. There were so many great sovereigns here. If anyone thought they could sneak in, they would be dreaming.</p><p>Lu Ming also stepped onto the ancient path and walked up step by step.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming reached the end of the ancient path and arrived at the door of light. Without any hesitation, Lu Ming stepped in.</p><p>Soon, all 320 heaven’s favorites stepped into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient road began to withdraw into the light door. Then, the light door disappeared from the sky.</p><p>“Senior, I wonder which major power acquired this corner of the world!”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>Some of the cultivators from the major forces were thinking about how great the benefits would be if they could pay a visit to this powerful figure and let some of the younger generation of their forces cultivate there.</p><p>“From the heavenly realm!”</p><p>The white-haired Emperor said.</p><p>Everyone shut up. It was actually a mighty person from the heaven realm.</p><p>At the same time, everyone was secretly shocked. Could it be that there was a powerful person from the heaven realm paying attention to this battle of the ten lands?</p><p>“Everyone, come back in two years!”</p><p>The white-haired Emperor said. Then, he took a step forward and left.</p><p>“Two years later, who will be the master of the game?”</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>They were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Then, everyone left, and the area around the mountain of Destiny returned to its peaceful state.</p><p>After Lu Ming stepped through the light door, the world spun. The next moment, he found himself on a protruding rock.</p><p>“What a strong pressure!”</p><p>As soon as he appeared, Lu Ming felt an endless pressure coming from all directions.</p><p>It was as if there were hundreds of mountains pressing down on him at all times.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming tried to take a step forward. The earth rumbled and Lu Ming’s body felt as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>“Is this the first corner of the primordial realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and looked around.</p><p>What came into view was a boundless rock.</p><p>There were rocks and barren land everywhere. There was no vegetation or any living beings.</p><p>A desolate and ancient aura came.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered that the connate Qi of origin here was unimaginably dense.</p><p>As he breathed in and out, a dense connate Qi of origin turned into beams of light and rushed into his mouth.</p><p>Also, Lu Ming felt that the laws here were extremely clear. When he released his spiritual consciousness, he felt as if his body was bathed in endless laws.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the Holy power into his eyes and was shocked.</p><p>At that moment, everything that appeared in front of Lu Ming changed. Between the sky and the earth, there were many tiny silk ribbons swimming, emitting various kinds of light.</p><p>It was as if the world was made up of thousands of thin threads.</p><p>These were all nomological threads that could only be formed when the nomological laws were extremely clear and dense.</p><p>the world at the beginning of the world. This is the world at the beginning of the world!</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>Legend had it that when the heavens and earth First opened and everything evolved, the cultivation environment was the best. The laws were clear and the innate Qi of origin was rich. Cultivation would be much faster then.</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor was right. This was an opportunity.</p><p>If an Emperor-to-be cultivated here, their chances of becoming an Emperor would be greatly increased.</p><p>however, the pressure from the world is too great!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>One could not fly here.</p><p>Not to mention flying, even walking for a short distance would probably exhaust the Saint power in his body.</p><p>The best way was to stay in place and cultivate quietly.</p><p>In fact, almost everyone who came in was like this, sitting cross-legged on the ground and quietly cultivating.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity. They only had two years, so they naturally had to cherish it.</p><p>Lu Ming also sat cross-legged on the spot and extended his spiritual consciousness. He could clearly capture various laws in the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
