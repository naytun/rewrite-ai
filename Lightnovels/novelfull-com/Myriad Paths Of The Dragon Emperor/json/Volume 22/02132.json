Now, he was going to fight Yun llaoge, who was at the same level as him.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, don’t regret it!”</p><p>Yun llaoge said. As soon as he finished speaking, he made his move. He pierced through the void and charged toward his opponent at an astonishing speed.</p><p>I’he gray-robed young man’s face remained calm. At that moment, he waved his hand, causing nomological laws to erupt. A huge cauldron appeared in his hand.</p><p>Primordial chaos laws!</p><p>This person was a son of primordial chaos.

Instead, he had suppressed his cultivation to the level of a two-star illusionary Emperor. He was on the same level as Yun Haoge, but he had defeated Yun Haoge with one move. How was this possible?</p><p>Many people found it hard to believe, but this was the truth!</p><p>“He’s too weak!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man shook his head and laughed.
