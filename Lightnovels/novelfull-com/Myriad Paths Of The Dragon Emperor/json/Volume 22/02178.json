After being called trash by fatty time and time again, his killing intent was incomparably thick.</p><p>Ren qianxing’s Saint realm cultivation was completely unleashed. His laws were surging, and Saint energy surrounded his body.</p><p>The Saint power rolled up, stirring up a storm that kept rolling toward fatty.</p><p>However, fatty didn’t react at all. He was still grinning.</p><p>the sage realm is so amazing. He can explode at any time as if no one has ever seen him!</p><p>The fatty was disdainful.</p><p>Many people were roaring in their hearts. The sage realm was indeed impressive at this stage. Not many people in the divine wilderness could reach it, much less the younger generation.</p><p>But the next moment, everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>This was because Fatty’s body was also emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>That was also the aura of a Sage, a Sage might that wasn’t any weaker than Ren qianxing’s.</p><p>the sage realm! This fatty has also reached the sage realm!</p><p>“Nest, 1 couldn’t tell!”</p><p>the heavenly Dao is unfair! This fatty is so fat and ugly, but he has also reached the sage realm. It’s unfair!</p><p>A group of girls shouted.</p><p>The fat man had originally pur on the air of a peerless master, but when he heard this, he was instantly stunned and then furious.</p><p>In his heart, he was scolding these women for having no taste and liking sissies.</p><p>Hence, he decided to vent all his anger on Ren qianxing.</p><p>Ren qianxing was stunned as well. He was extremely displeased. There was actually someone from rhe younger generation who had entered the sage realm like him.</p><p>“So what if you’ve entered rhe sage realm? You’re still weak in my hands. 1’11 defeat you in one move!’1</p><p>“Soaring wind sword!”</p><p>Ren qianxing made his move. The first move he made was an innate technique.</p><p>Rays of sword light appeared in the air and shot towards the fatty at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“Watch me break your Divine Art!”</p><p>The fatty shouted as he swung his battle-axe.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An axe radiance shook the heavens and was incomparably huge. It swept across thousands of troops as if it could split open the sky.</p><p>This was the divine ability that Lu Ming had given him. Although he had only cultivated ir for a short period of time, his mastery was still low.</p><p>However, Fatty’s current spirit body was a medium-grade heaven spirit body. When he burst out, his power was shocking.</p><p>Ren qianxing’s spiritual body was only a mid-grade earth spiritual body. Back in the divine wilderness, it might have been extremely rare. However, when compared to fatty, he was still far from it.</p><p>As the axe radiance swept past, all of Ren qianxing’s sword radiance was completely extinguished. However, the axe radiance didn’t stop and continued slashing towards Ren qianxing.</p><p>Ren qianxing was almost scared to death.</p><p>He roared in fear and retreated frantically.</p><p>In the end, he was almost cut in half by the axe. Although he dodged ir, his chest was still swept by the Axe’s radiance. A deep wound appeared, and blood flowed our.</p><p>The terrifying destructive power gushed into his body, causing him to spit out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>‘This …’</p><p>The entire place fell silent!</p><p>Most of the people were looking at the scene in disbelief.</p><p>Ren qianxing had actually been defeated.</p><p>He was defeated in one move!</p><p>He was the number one prodigy in rhe divine wilderness, and he was also known as rhe number one prodigy since ancient times. Now, he had actually been defeated by fatty in one move.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“Howls this possible? No, this can’t be real!”</p><p>Many ignorant girls shook their heads in confusion. It was hard for them to believe that their idol was so weak.</p><p>“That’s impossible, ah …”</p><p>Ren qianxing howled in disbelief.</p><p>Previously, he had said that he would defeat rhe fatty in one move, but now, he had been defeated by the fatty in one move.</p><p>He was known as the number one heaven’s favorite since ancient times. He couldn’t bear such a blow.</p><p>His eyes were red, and he wanted to cut the fatty into pieces.</p><p>“Bastard, go to hell!”</p><p>He charged at fatty in a frenzy.</p><p>“I’ll play with you!”</p><p>Fatty kept his battle axe and rushed towards Ren qianxing as he sent out a punch.</p><p>This punch was unstoppable, and it directly shattered Ren qianxing’s attack before landing on his face.</p><p>Ren qianxing screamed as he was sent flying. His teeth and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Those ignorant girls were all stunned. They felt like their faith had collapsed.</p><p>it turned our that their idol was not invincible, but completely vulnerable.</p><p>Hua Chi, Xia Jiuyang, Xie Luan, and the others were all stunned.</p><p>They were extremely puzzled. How did Fatty’s combat strength suddenly increase to such a shocking level?</p><p>Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the others had also broken through to the bright Saint realm, but they would still lose to Ren qianxing without a doubt, because they did not have the corresponding sacred art.</p><p>However, this fatty was able to easily suppress Ren qianxing.</p><p>In addition, Zhuang Xiaoshan s cultivation and combat power had also improved greatly.</p><p>What was going on? Could it be that they had encountered a great fortuitous encounter?</p><p>They could not figure it out.</p><p>Ren qianxing couldn’t figure it out either. At this moment, he only had one thought in his mind, and that was to kill fatty.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>However, at the next moment, the fatty punched him in the face again, and he was sent flying again while screaming. His face was so unrecognizable that it was unbearable to look at.</p><p>a piece of trash like you dares to claim to be rhe number one prodigy in history.</p><p>You’re simply shameless. You’re not even worthy to lick Lu Ming’s shoes!</p><p>a piece of trash like you wants to marry niece Hua Rou? you’re even more shameless. If I were you, I’d kill myself. It’s embarrassing to live like this!</p><p>The fat man continued to mock.</p><p>Ren qianxing howled in anger as he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Men, men, skin that fatty and pull out his tendons!”</p><p>Ren qianxing howled.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, an expert from the DI family stepped out and charged at the fatty.</p><p>This person was in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. His aura was earth-shattering.</p><p>Sakra’s face was gloomy, but he didn’t stop her.</p><p>wayaya, how despicable. You can’t beat him, so you call for help. I’ll run!</p><p>Fatty ran off.</p><p>“Let’s see how you can run away from me.”</p><p>The sovereign race’s absolute Saint in the great circle had a cold expression. He extended his hand and grabbed the fatty.</p><p>The giant hand covered the sky, and fatty had nowhere to run.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Hua Chi, Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, Yan kuangtu, and the others expressions changed drastically. They wanted to help, but the difference in their cultivation base was too great. They wanted to help, but they were powerless.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a black light burst out from the crowd. It was thousands of meters long and cut off the big hand.</p><p>Furthermore, the black light did not stop. It was unbelievably fast as it directly slashed through the forehead of the Imperial race absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Imperial race absolute Saint in the great circle was cut in half, and his body fell to the ground.</p><p>Everyone widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>A person in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm had been lulled just like that without being able to fight back at all.</p><p>Who was doing this?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
