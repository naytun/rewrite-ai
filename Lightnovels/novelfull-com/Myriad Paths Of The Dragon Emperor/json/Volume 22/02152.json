The terrifying pressure was like a storm that pressed down on the many demon mountains of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying aura from Qiu Yue, Longyuan Shan and yang tianzong were completely stunned. Then, their bodies started to tremble.</p><p>A martial Supreme!</p><p>Qiu Yue was actually a martial Supreme. The beautiful lady who had been following Lu Ming was actually a martial Supreme.</p><p>Heavens, such a young martial Supreme!</p><p>What did a martial sovereign represent? in the Azure continent, he was the ruler, a Supreme existence.</p><p>The people of the Azure continent basically didn’t know the specific division of martial sovereigns. In their eyes, as long as one reached the rank of a martial sovereign, they would be invincible.</p><p>In fact, many people even referred to ordinary void emperors as great emperors.</p><p>At this moment, the Tian Yu demonic sect was in complete chaos.</p><p>Martial Emperor! It’s the Martial Emperor!</p><p>“A martial sovereign has appeared!”</p><p>Someone shouted. Within the many demon mountains of the Tian Yu demon sect, figures flickered. Some people were terrified.</p><p>This was because this was an unfamiliar Martial Emperor, not one from evil spirit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of light shot out from one of the demon mountains. A figure appeared in the sky, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>Emperor might!</p><p>He was also a martial Supreme!</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul, it’s him! This guy is still alive!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The person who had appeared was actually Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>When Lu Ming first came to the yuan continent, he had once entered the Emperor Gang secret realm. There, he had seen Shakyamuni soul-destroying and Emperor Cang.</p><p>The two of them had fought for sixty thousand years inside.</p><p>Later on, Emperor Gang’s corpse appeared, but Shakyamuni annihilating soul disappeared. Then, there was news that Lu Ming had obtained Emperor Gang’s storage ring and legacy. This incident had almost pushed Lu Ming into a corner.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming had suspected that Shakyamuni annihilating soul was not dead and that he was the one who had leaked the news. Now, it seemed that he was right.</p><p>Furthermore, the injuries caused by the soul-destroying law had already healed.</p><p>“He’s only a one-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed and found that Shakyamuni annihilating soul was only a one-star illusionary Emperor. He was relieved.</p><p>An ordinary one-star void Emperor was no match for Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul said in a serious tone.</p><p>He was shocked that Qiu Yue had broken through to the Martial Emperor realm at such a young age.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly. She waved her hand and hit Dharma King annihilating soul.</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul had no choice but to fight with Qiu Yue. The two of them fought in the sky, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>“Junior Brother, lady Qiuyue is the reinforcement you invited?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain asked.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled but did not answer. He said,” “Senior brother, take me into the Tian Yu demon sect and find the person who set up the restriction!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong nodded. They knew that this was a critical moment and they could only choose to believe in Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them rushed into the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong were also being controlled, so the evil spirit cultivators would not stop them. Lu Ming concealed his aura and followed the two of them. The others also thought that Lu Ming was ‘one of them’, so they naturally did not stop him.</p><p>They shuttled through the demon mountains, searching for the person who set up the restriction.</p><p>Moreover, everyone’s attention was on the Emperor-level battle in the sky. Not many people paid attention to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I see it!”</p><p>Suddenly, yang tianzong revealed a happy expression.</p><p>A group of people stood on a demon mountain in front of them. One of them was a skinny old woman.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized her at a glance because he had seen with his own eyes that the old woman had set up a restriction for others.</p><p>The three of them flew toward the mountain peak.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>Someone looked at the three of them.</p><p>“Sir, we have something to report. It’s about the martial sovereign!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain bowed.</p><p>“Oh, come over and tell me!”</p><p>The skinny old woman looked at the three from Longyuan mountain.</p><p>The three of them flew toward the demon mountain and slowly approached the skinny old woman.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. He had to kill this old woman instantly. Otherwise, Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong would be in danger. The other party could control the restriction with a single thought and destroy Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong’s souls.</p><p>“Do you know who the martial sovereign is? If you have any news, tell me everything!”</p><p>The skinny old woman said.</p><p>Beside him, there were a few elders with profound cultivation. They were all in the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“Sir, 1 accidentally received a piece of news. It’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward, pretending to want to reply. He moved closer to the old woman.</p><p>“What is it? say it. No, wait a minute, you …”</p><p>At that moment, the old woman realized that something was wrong. She did not sense any restriction fluctuations on Lu Ming. In other words, Lu Ming was not controlled by her restriction.</p><p>Except for the DI family, the Tian Yu demon sect, and the disciples of evil spirit, all the other forces who had surrendered were controlled by her.</p><p>Gould it be that this kid was from the evil spirit sect, or the DI family?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, many thoughts flashed through the old woman’s mind.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming exploded and charged at the old woman.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the distance of tens of meters was covered in an instant. It even exceeded the human reaction time.</p><p>Before the old woman could react, Lu Ming had already rushed in front of her and struck her head with his palm.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The old woman’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>He was killed in one move!</p><p>At this time, the others finally reacted.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Brat, kill!”</p><p>Beside the old woman, the other Emperor-to-be flew into a rage and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Old woman, to be able to set up a restriction in another person’s soul requires talent. Not all evil spirit people can do it, and it’s extremely rare.</p><p>Right now, the only person in evil spirit who could do this was the old woman.</p><p>The old woman had a disciple. Although he also had this kind of talent, his cultivation was too weak, and he was not of much use.</p><p>Therefore, the old woman’s death was a huge loss to evil spirit.</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and struck out a palm. The terrifying palm force gushed out like an avalanche. Several Emperor-to-be’s bodies exploded and they died on the spot.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>At that moment, Longyuan mountain and yang tianzong reacted and were dumbfounded.</p><p>That was an Emperor-to-be. A few Emperor-to-be were killed by Lu Ming with one palm without any resistance.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s current realm?</p><p>“Senior brother, have you broken the restriction?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s broken! As soon as the old woman died, the restriction will automatically break!”</p><p>The two of them reacted and revealed looks of joy.</p><p>“The restriction has been broken, our restriction has been broken!”</p><p>At this moment, the entire Tianyu demonic sect was in an uproar.</p><p>At least half of the Azure continent’s surrendered sects were gathered here to help evil spirit refine pills. At this moment, everyone felt that their restrictions had been broken.</p><p>“Everyone, follow me and kill our way out!”</p><p>kill! at this moment, a loud roar was heard. Then, a sword light shot up into the sky and killed a few evil spirit disciples.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
