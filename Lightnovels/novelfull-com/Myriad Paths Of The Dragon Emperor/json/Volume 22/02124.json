He approached Yun Haoge at an alarming speed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming struck out with more than a hundred palm strikes. The void exploded, and more than a hundred palm prints completely enveloped Yun Haoge from all directions, causing space-time to be in chaos.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Haoge could not escape using the space-time law even if he wanted to. He could only take Lu Ming’s palm force head-on.</p><p>He shouted in anger, activating the space-time law and exploding with the power of the world to fight Lu Ming head-on.</p><p>After more than a hundred consecutive palm strikes, Yun Haoge’s body trembled violently as if he had been electrocuted. The space-time law that covered his body was destroyed, and his arm exploded. He could not resist Lu Ming’s palm force.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming slapped Yun Haoge across the face, causing him to fall to the ground and convulse.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kicked Yun Haoge’s face, sending him flying off the stage.</p><p>“You want to abuse me? you’re not just a little bit weaker!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Yun Haoge fell down from the fighting ring, his face swollen like a pig’s head. It took him a long time to come to his senses. When he realized what had happened to him, he was so furious that he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>This time, it was really embarrassing.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, well done! Well done!</p><p>Bubbles was clapping her little hands in celebration.</p><p>The way many people looked at Lu Ming had changed.</p><p>It was beyond many people’s expectations that Lu Ming could actually defeat Yun Haoge.</p><p>that’s right. He has also mastered array Dao laws. 1 didn’t expect him to have already cultivated three types of laws to perfection and even fused them together!</p><p>he’s indeed talented. He’s not even a Saint Emperor, but he can cultivate three types of nomological laws. It’s rare. No wonder he’s so strong!</p><p>Every time a law was fused, its power would increase explosively.</p><p>Even many low-level void emperors would find it difficult to fuse three types of laws.</p><p>Putting aside the fact that Lu Ming had mastered two ultimate maxims, even if he only mastered three ordinary maxims, his talent was shocking.</p><p>Previously, everyone thought that Lu Ming would only be able to get the seventh place and would not be able to compete with people like heartless, Chek, and Bao de.</p><p>But now, they had changed their minds.</p><p>The fact that he could defeat Yun Haoge meant that Lu Ming’s abilities were already at the level of heartless, cheater, Badao, and bubbles.</p><p>They were qualified to compete for the top five.</p><p>He had yet to become a saint Emperor, but he already had such an achievement. It was truly shocking.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming achieved four consecutive victories.</p><p>In the second match of the fourth round, bubbles was up against the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>“I have no hair. Little guy, you and I are really fated!”</p><p>In the fighting ring, the heartless monk looked at bubbles seriously and almost drooled.</p><p>This was one of the top ten war beasts! The unscrupulous monk’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>“Monk, it seems like you’re looking for a beating!”</p><p>Pao Pao could not be bothered to waste her breath on the unscrupulous monk. This was what Lu Ming had taught her. She would attack the unscrupulous monk whenever she saw him.</p><p>“Little guy, you and I are really fated!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk shouted. He didn’t hesitate to attack. His entire body was covered in Buddhist light. Those who didn’t understand the unscrupulous monk would really be deceived by his appearance and think that he was an eminent monk.</p><p>Bubbles did not dare to be careless. He immediately transformed into his true form and controlled spacetime to travel.</p><p>The space-time spirit rat was already very powerful, and its control over time and space was far above Yun Haoge’s.</p><p>This exchange was extremely strange because the unscrupulous monk could not hit bubbles at all. No matter how he used his Buddhist Kingdom palm, Buddhist lion’s roar, Buddhist giant palm imprint, and other divine arts, he could not do anything to bubbles.</p><p>Instead, he was sometimes ambushed by bubbles and was flustered.</p><p>In the end, he was sent flying out of the fighting stage by bubbles.</p><p>“Monk, you’re really thick-skinned!”</p><p>Bubbles pursed her lips.</p><p>The bubble could only send the monk flying out of the fighting ring because the monk’s golden body of Buddha had an extremely strong defense. The bubble could not break through it.</p><p>Of course, it would be a different story if Pao Pao’s cultivation level had improved and she was on the same level as the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>The third match of the fourth round, Yuan Xin versus Chek!</p><p>This was another pinnacle battle-the son of chaos versus the primordial demonic Dao.</p><p>Ao ke transformed into a purple-gold true dragon that was a thousand meters long. Purple light flowed all over his body, and his dragon claws tore through the void. He displayed the magical power of the demon race and fought with Yuan Xin.</p><p>However, although Cheke was very strong, he was still a little weaker than Yuan Xin. Yuan Xin had used two nomological laws and defeated Cheke.</p><p>Then, Tianming versus Heng Xinghe. There was no suspense. Heng Xinghe directly admitted defeat.</p><p>And in the fifth match, Bao de fought against ancient devil. Without a doubt, Bao de won.</p><p>The fourth round ended, and not long after, the fifth round began.</p><p>The first match of the fifth round, Lu Ming versus Chek.</p><p>Pinker’s eyes were solemn. The strength that Lu Ming had displayed earlier was enough to threaten him. Hence, Pinker used all his strength as soon as he made his move. He transformed into a purple-gold true dragon and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed, and a shocking Dragon’s Roar came from within. It made ao ke’s body tremble, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Nine Dragons…”</p><p>Creak’s expression was a little ugly.</p><p>In a battle between experts, every second counted. Creak was slightly stunned, but Lu Ming had already rushed over, erupting with the chaos law, death law, and array Dao law.</p><p>The three laws combined into one and unleashed a storm of attacks, suppressing creak.</p><p>Creak barely managed to block dozens of moves and was blasted off the fighting ring by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming won!</p><p>This made many people reevaluate Lu Ming’s combat ability.</p><p>They thought that he already had the strength to compete for the top three.</p><p>I’m afraid Lu Ming can fight with Bao de. However, compared to Yuan Xin and Tian Ming, he’s still a little weaker!</p><p>that’s right. If there are no accidents, he should be hovering between third and fourth place!</p><p>Some people discussed and re-evaluated the rankings.</p><p>The first match of the fifth round had ended, and the second match was bubbles versus Yuan Xin.</p><p>This battle was extremely intense. In her true form, Paopao had pushed her space time laws to their limits, making them unpredictable.</p><p>However, Yuan Xin was indeed powerful. Just like how Lu Ming had fought Yun Haoge previously, he had used his powerful strength to break the space-time law.</p><p>Ultimately, bubbles did not win this battle. After exchanging many moves, seeing that he was at a disadvantage, he simply admitted defeat.</p><p>The third match was heartless versus ancient devil. Heartless won.</p><p>After that, Tianming and Bao de won, respectively.</p><p>After entering the sixth round, the atmosphere became lively in the first round.</p><p>This was because in the first round, Lu Ming was fighting against Bao de.</p><p>In the eyes of most people, Lu Ming and Bao de were at the same level and they were the most powerful candidates to fight for the third place.</p><p>Whoever won this round would get third place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re impressive. You’re not a Saint Emperor yet, but you already have such combat power. I, old Bao, admire you. However, I’m sure 1’11 win this round!”</p><p>Bao de grinned. His eyes revealed a fierce light, like a big black bear.</p><p>“Big guy, don’t be so full of yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>then let me see how powerful the fusion of two ultimate maxims is!</p><p>Bao de’s expression was ferocious. He took a step forward and his entire body was like a mountain as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>With a punch, the space exploded and was compressed together, turning into a terrifying fist force that crushed toward Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
