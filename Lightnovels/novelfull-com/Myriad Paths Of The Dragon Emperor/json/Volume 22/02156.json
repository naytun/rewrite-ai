It seems like you’re a heaven’s favorite from ancient Moon Holy Land. Just in time to kill you, hehe!</p><p>The other Shakyamuni sneered and a black light burst out from his body. In the light, it seemed like ghosts were wailing and wolves were howling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He rushed towards Qiu Yue, and the black light enveloped Qiu Yue. Within the black light, there seemed to be countless evil ghosts.</p><p>“Two-star void Emperor! ‘1</p><p>Qiu Yue’s gaze was slightly serious. Then, she waved her hand and two curved daggers flew out, turning into Yin Yang wheels.</p><p>The yin-yang wheel spun rapidly and exploded with destructive power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided. The evil spirits in the black light were destroyed, but Qiu Yue’s attack was also blocked.</p><p>“The Guardian King of ten thousand ghosts was also blocked!”</p><p>The evil spirit people s faces changed.</p><p>The discipline King of ten thousand ghosts was an extremely powerful discipline King. He was much stronger than discipline King spirit-devouring, but he was still blocked by Qiu Yue.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Then, Qiu Yue and the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts continued to fight. The two of them were in a fierce battle, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Lu Ming was relieved. The other party was only a two-star illusionary Emperor. With Qiu Yue s combat strength, she was able to stop him.</p><p>If the other party was too strong, Lu Ming would attack directly and suppress the other party. This way, Qiu Yue could train herself.</p><p>little girl, your strength is not bad, but at most, you can only fight me to a draw. But those people must die!</p><p>The ten thousand ghostly King sneered.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s expression was calm. She knew Lu Ming’s strength. These people were just courting death if they wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu Yue and the Shakyamuni of ten thousand ghosts exchanged another blow, and both of them retreated a distance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The soul-devouring law moved and appeared on the other side of Qiu Yue. Its cold aura enveloped Qiu Yue, and together with the thousand Ghoul Dharma King, they blocked Qiu Yue’s path of retreat.</p><p>little girl, how dare a mere martial Supreme like you come here? don’t leave today. But before that, I’ll let you see how those people are killed!</p><p>Shakyamuni sneered and gave an order,” “All of you, attack and kill all these intruders! Leave no one alive!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Many people from the DI family shouted as they stepped out one after another.</p><p>There were people from the DI family, evil spirit, heavenly God sect, and Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Eor example, the sect Masters of the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the tower master of the blood demon tower had their eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Prepare to face the enemy!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>“Master, you guys stay on the outside and kill those who escape later!”</p><p>Lu Ming s words stunned the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others.</p><p>Then, they saw Lu Ming stepping forward alone to meet the sect master of the tianshen sect and the others.</p><p>“Leave this kid to me!”</p><p>die! the sect master of the tianshen sect shouted coldly. His eyes were cold and his body was filled with killing intent. At the same time, the aura he exuded was also extremely shocking. He had reached the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>old dog, it seems like you’ve been working hard for evil spirit all these years. You’ve actually advanced to the Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The sect master of the sky god sect must have received a lot of resources from the evil spirit sect. Otherwise, his cultivation would not have improved so quickly.</p><p>However, the potential of the tianshen sect’s sect master had already been exhausted. It was impossible for him to break through to the Martial Emperor realm in his lifetime.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect shouted coldly. He was filled with killing intent as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a puppet appeared.</p><p>It was a human-shaped puppet with a saber on its back. At this moment, the saber was unsheathed. It also had the cultivation of the Emperor-to-be realm and charged at the sect master of the tianshen sect.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect was immediately blocked.</p><p>this is a puppet of the Emperor-to-be realm. You actually have a puppet of the Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>The sect master of the sky god sect roared. He was extremely shocked and revealed a greedy look at the same time.</p><p>This was a puppet of the Emperor-to-be realm. If he could get his hands on it, it would definitely be a great fighting force.</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect was fighting with the Emperor-to-be puppet. However, the puppet was not afraid of death and was attacking madly. For a moment, the sect master of the tianshen sect was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I m here to kill you!”</p><p>Another figure rushed toward Lu Ming. It was the tower master of the blood demon tower.</p><p>in the past few years, the tower master’s cultivation had skyrocketed and he had reached the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look. He waved his hand and a puppet appeared. It charged at the tower master of the blood demon tower and suppressed him. Another Emperor-to-be puppet!</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded and envious.</p><p>This was an Emperor-to-be puppet. With just one of them, he could do whatever he wanted in the three prefectures.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were also stunned. They had not seen Lu Ming use it before.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 don’t believe that you have so many Emperor-to-be puppets. Die!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not take out a puppet.</p><p>The sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect had deliberately taken Xie nianqing as his disciple back then, but he secretly wanted to let the Shakyamuni of evil spirit take over his body. He had long been on Lu Ming’s must-kill list.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect approached Lu Ming at top speed. He was overjoyed when he saw that Lu Ming had not taken out any puppets. He thought that Lu Ming had used up all his puppets.</p><p>“Die!1”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly.</p><p>“Old hag, no one can save you today!1’</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said calmly. He rook a step forward and appeared in front of the sect master of the sky demon sect in an instant. He pointed his finger.</p><p>A finger force was aimed at the dantian of the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect was at the Emperor-to-be realm, but he was completely useless against Lu Ming s attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming s finger force pierced through the dantian of the sect master of the sky demon sect and shattered her Saint heart.</p><p>arghh! the Grandmaster of the sky demon sect screamed as he retreated. He was caught by an elder of the sky demon sect.</p><p>“Ah, ah, little bastard, you’ve destroyed my cultivation, you’ve destroyed my cultivation, my cultivation!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect screamed in despair.</p><p>With his Saint heart destroyed, all his cultivation would be in vain. He would become a cripple from then on. She almost went crazy.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the heavenly God sect, the tower master of the blood demon tower, and a few others felt their hair stand on end and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>They were well aware of the strength of the sect master of the sky demon sect. He was definitely not weaker than them. However, he could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming and was crippled of his cultivation.</p><p>The two of them could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Where are you guys going?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and pointed two fingers in succession. Two finger forces shot out at an astonishing speed. The sect master of the deity sect and the tower master of the blood demon tower did not even have time to react. Their dantians were pierced and their Saint hearts shattered. They followed in the footsteps of the sect master of the sky demon sect and were crippled of their cultivation.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>The two of them shrieked miserably and were filled with despair.</p><p>They knew that they were finished. Their entire lives of bitter cultivation had turned into flowing water.</p><p>let’s attack together and kill this bastard! Kill this bastard!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect roared madly.</p><p>She was going crazy!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
