Previously, he had helped Zhuang Xiaoshan secretly and was able to crush Li Ke. How strong must his cultivation be?</p><p>However, his tone was indeed too arrogant. He actually wanted sakra to wash his neck clean and wait for death. He was really arrogant without limits.</p><p>Many people secretly shook their heads, thinking that Lu Ming was just spouting nonsense to satisfy his mouth.</p><p>“Many thanks … Senior, please help me!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou came over and thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, they were also very surprised. They had never seen Lu Ming before and did not know why he helped them.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he turned and walked out of the city.</p><p>Qiu Yue followed Lu Ming. Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou looked at each other and then followed Lu Ming obediently.</p><p>Very quickly, they left the city and came to a remote area. There was no one here.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and turned around.</p><p>. It’s been many years since we’ve met. you two little fellows …”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. Now, he did not hide his voice and it returned to his original voice.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s bodies trembled violently. Their eyes widened in disbelief, and then, their disbelief turned into endless joy.</p><p>“MA… Master…”</p><p>“Master, is it really you?”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His appearance began to change and he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s appearance, which had not changed much since more than ten years ago, the two of them trembled even more violently.</p><p>“Master, you … He’s back!”</p><p>The two of them were incoherent, especially Zhuang xiaorou, who was so excited that tears kept falling.</p><p>“You’re still crying? you’re already so old!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and shed tears for Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>After a long time, the siblings ’emotions finally stabilized.</p><p>“Master, when did you return? why didn’t you inform us?”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou smiled.</p><p>I just came back. The moment I came back, 1 found that the world had changed greatly. I was afraid that you would be controlled by the strong practitioners of the yuan continent, so 1 didn’t send a message. 1 wanted to secretly gather information!</p><p>Lu Ming asked,”what’s the situation now?” Are Xie Lun and the others alright? and my parents?”</p><p>senior Xie Luan and the others have always been under the control of the monarch race and forced to work for them. On the other hand, Grand-teacher and Grand-teacher are fine. They’re just nearby!</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan said.</p><p>The great-Grandmaster and great-Grandmaster he was talking about were Lu Ming’s parents.</p><p>“My parents are not far away?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>yes, Grand-teacher and Grand-teacher’s cultivation is relatively weak, so the sovereign race didn’t pay much attention to them. They left the Imperial Dragon City a long time ago, and they still have time to go in with senior mo Tian!</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou said.</p><p>“Senior mo Tian, fatty? Let’s go, take me there!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou took Lu Ming and Qiu Yue and flew towards the South.</p><p>On the way, Qiu Yue had also returned to her original appearance. The Zhuang siblings were so surprised that they almost called Qiu Yue master’s wife.</p><p>He only found out about Qiu Yue’s true identity after that.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming asked the siblings about what had happened in the past few years in detail. The siblings shared their thoughts in detail, allowing Lu Ming to understand more about the situation in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range was majestic and vast. They flew all the way to a Valley.</p><p>In the distance, he could see a few wooden houses in the valley.</p><p>“Great-teacher, great-teacher’s wife…”</p><p>From afar, the Zhuang siblings cried out.</p><p>A figure walked out of the wooden house.</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming could see his parents.</p><p>“It’s Xiao Shan. Xiao Rou has returned …”</p><p>Li Ping smiled. However, at the next moment, Li Ping’s voice stopped abruptly. She saw Lu Ming and could not look away.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Yuntian also saw Lu Ming. Just like Li Ping, he could not shift his gaze away.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, it’s really you. Ming’ er, you’re back. Old man, help me take a look. Am I seeing things? I’m seeing Ming ‘er again!”</p><p>Li Ping mumbled to herself. As she spoke, her tears flowed down.</p><p>“You’re not seeing things, Ming ‘er really is back!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming also felt a lump in his throat. It had been more than ten years since they parted in a hurry.</p><p>Although the concept of time in the world of martial Dao was different from that of ordinary people, and a closed-door cultivation could last a few years, it had been more than ten years since he last saw the two elders. They must have missed him a lot.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was going to the yuan continent alone. The danger was unknown. It would be strange if they were not worried.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and came before the two elders.</p><p>Li Ping pulled Lu Ming and sized him up carefully. She was completely speechless and her tears flowed.</p><p>“I say, why are you crying? It’s a good thing that Ming ‘er is back. Why do you keep crying? you’re really a woman …”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said. However, tears were also welling up in his eyes.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, let your friend come in and have, seat…”</p><p>As Lu Yuntian spoke, he turned to look at Qiu Yue. The moment he saw her, he was stunned.</p><p>“Autumn… Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was in slight disbelief.</p><p>Li Ping’s gaze also turned to Qiu Yue, and she was stunned.</p><p>“Qiuyue, Qiuyue, it’s really you. You’re back too?”</p><p>Li Ping was extremely surprised.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were already filled with tears, and she could not hold it in at this time. She rushed into Li Ping’s arms, and her eyes fell as she said,”Madam, master, Qiuyue is back, Qiuyue is back to see you!”</p><p>“It’s good that you’re back, it’s good that you’re back!”</p><p>Li Ping caressed Qiu Yue’s beautiful hair and was extremely happy.</p><p>In their hearts, Qiu Yue was like their daughter. However, it had been almost twenty years since they last saw her. Now that they had met again, they were naturally excited.</p><p>After a long time, everyone’s emotions finally calmed down.</p><p>Li Ping held Qiu Yue’s hand and asked her all sorts of questions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hahaha, it’s really you!”</p><p>At this moment, two ‘burly’ figures flew over.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and smiled.</p><p>Who else could it be but fatty Kong Jin?</p><p>The other one was the devil Sky Emperor.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across and realized that the devil Sky Emperor was no longer an Emperor. His cultivation had already reached the lower tier of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>Thinking about it, it was true.</p><p>Back when the original energy was scarce, anyone who could break through to the martial Royal realm was definitely the best in terms of talent, wisdom, perseverance, and so on.</p><p>Moreover, at the beginning of the world’s metamorphosis, those martial emperors also had an absolute advantage and could obtain a large amount of resources. Thus, it was not surprising that the demonic sky sovereign had broken through to the Saint realm.</p><p>It was likely that the emperors of that era had all broken through to the Saint plane.</p><p>As for fatty Kong, his cultivation was different from before. He had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>However, his body had become even fatter, and he looked like a meatbail.</p><p>“Fatty!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Hahaha! Come, give me a hug!”</p><p>The fat man rushed over and crashed into Lu Ming like a body. The fat on his body jiggled like waves.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly dodged or he would be suffocated to death..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
