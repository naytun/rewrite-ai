He had suppressed all the paragons and stood at the peak.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lu Ming was the most dazzling in the battle of the ten lands. No one could compare to him.</p><p>He had defeated Yuan Xin, Tian Ming, and even the heaven realm’s pride. This was destined to be recorded in the history books.</p><p>Previously, everyone had thought that Lu Ming had a bright future and that his future achievements were unimaginable. He would become a top expert.</p><p>Some powerful forces had even planned to befriend Lu Ming and build a good relationship with him.</p><p>However, the celestial Thearch had said that Lu Ming could not break through to the Martial Emperor realm and would be trapped in the Emperor-to-be realm for the rest of his life.</p><p>No one would question the celestial Thearch’s words.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming’s outcome was already decided.</p><p>what a pity! A rare heaven’s favorite. What a pity!</p><p>Some of the people from the major forces sighed. They had planned to befriend Lu Ming and build a good relationship with him. However, they had dispelled this idea now.</p><p>If he could not break through to the martial Supreme realm, then no matter how strong he was, he would not be taken seriously by these major forces.</p><p>No matter how strong he was, how strong could he be below the rank of a martial Supreme?</p><p>Any true Emperor would be able to crush them.</p><p>“Hahaha, the heavens have eyes, the heavens have eyes!”</p><p>The Heng family, he family, Daluo heaven sect, ancient Moon Holy Land’s golden Crow clan, Wan family, Sky Wolf tower, and other forces laughed madly in their hearts.</p><p>They were simply too excited. It was as if joy had descended from the heavens. Previously, the abilities that Lu Ming had displayed had made them tremble with fear. They were so afraid that they could die.</p><p>They were afraid that Lu Ming would rise up and seek revenge on them. However, Lu Ming could not break through to the Martial Emperor realm now.</p><p>He would be trapped in the Emperor-to-be realm for the rest of his life. He would not be a threat to them at all.</p><p>No matter how strong an Emperor-to-be was, what could he do?</p><p>“A peerless cripple, hehe!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he family sneered. He had been holding a grudge ever since he was beaten up by Lu Ming who controlled the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>To those who had a grudge against Lu Ming, there was no better news than this.</p><p>However, those who were on good terms with Lu Ming could not remain calm. They sighed one after another.</p><p>“The heavenly Dao is unfair!”</p><p>An old man from the Phoenix Palace sighed.</p><p>Such a proud Son of Heaven, a proud Son of Heaven that had never appeared in the primordial realm since ancient times, was unable to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. It was truly lamentable.</p><p>Emperor formless and uncle Kong were also in disbelief.</p><p>heavenly Emperor, has no one ever broken this shackle and entered the Martial Emperor realm in history?”</p><p>Uncle Kong asked.</p><p>no, never. Those who wanted to break through died. The others were stuck at Emperor-to-be for the rest of their lives!</p><p>The celestial Thearch shook his head. He also felt that it was a pity.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s body trembled, and he seemed to have instantly aged many years, hahaha, good, good. It’s just a piece of trash. I finally don’t have to be afraid! he’s just a piece of trash. To think that 1 even treated him as a peerless genius! The Heng family, the he family, the Golden Crow clan, and other forces all laughed with smiles on their faces.</p><p>Of course, they didn’t dare to say it out loud. They only thought about it in their hearts.</p><p>“Trash, hehe, he’s only strong now. It won’t be long before I surpass him in all aspects!”</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, also sneered.</p><p>At this moment, he was filled with confidence.</p><p>Lu Ming could not break through to the martial Supreme realm. He was no longer qualified to be his opponent.</p><p>1 was thinking of defeating you with my own hands one day. Hehe, 1 actually lost to a piece of trash!</p><p>Tianming sneered in his heart and shook his head.</p><p>“What a pity, he would have been a very good opponent!”</p><p>The purple-haired young man sighed.</p><p>“No, my master will definitely break through!”</p><p>“I don’t believe that Lu Ming can break the shackles!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and the others still found it hard to believe.</p><p>no, 1’11 definitely break through. I’ll definitely become a martial Supreme. Even the heavens can’t stop me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. He clenched his fists tightly and his voice was filled with determination.</p><p>what a joke. The celestial Thearch has already said it, but he still doesn’t believe it. Wishful thinking!</p><p>A middle-aged man from the WAN family couldn’t help but sneer, which immediately attracted angry gazes. He immediately shut up.</p><p>“You want to force a breakthrough?”</p><p>The celestial Thearch looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>yes, I believe in myself. I can break the shackles. The path is created by humans. The ancient people didn’t do it, but it doesn’t mean 1 can’t!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely determined.</p><p>Since ancient times, no one had been able to control two ultimate maxims at the same time. Didn’t he achieve it too?</p><p>there’s a risk of death if you try to break through to the martial Supreme realm forcefully. Are you ready? ”</p><p>The celestial Thearch said with a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p><p>He sighed in his heart. He admired Lu Ming’s talent, willpower, and firm heart in martial arts. If Lu Ming had not been crippled, his future would have been unbelievable. It would not have been impossible for him to break through to the celestial Thearch realm.</p><p>“I will definitely succeed!” Lu Ming’s gaze was firm.</p><p>alright, since that’s the case, 1’11 give you ten days to prepare. After ten days, 1’11 lend you a hand and help you break through to the martial Supreme realm!</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s voice resounded in all directions.</p><p>What? The celestial Thearch was going to help Lu Ming break through to the martial Supreme realm personally. This was definitely a great opportunity. “Detestable!”</p><p>The Heng clan, he clan, ancient Moon Holy Land golden Crow clan, Wan clan and other forces were all shocked, extremely unwilling and envious.</p><p>The celestial Thearch actually wanted to help.</p><p>Initially, they were overjoyed when they heard that Lu Ming could not break through to the martial Supreme realm. Now, they were afraid that Lu Ming would succeed with the help of the celestial Thearch.</p><p>They were all secretly praying that Lu Ming would not succeed.</p><p>As for Lu Xiangxiang and the others, they were ecstatic.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted the celestial Thearch solemnly to express his gratitude.</p><p>He was sincere. He really didn’t expect the celestial Thearch to help him.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Uncle Kong and Emperor formless also bowed.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, and the others also bowed.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>After that, many people in Mount Yuan also bowed to express their gratitude to the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>For example, the Holy Emperor of the ancient Saint clan and some other powers.</p><p>They all knew that when the alien race had wreaked havoc in Mount Yuan, it was Lu Ming and a few great emperors who had risked their lives to seal the void passageway that the alien race had come through. They were grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>In the end, the eternal Emperor of the land of infinite demons, the divine</p><p>Lands, and other powerful beings from other regions expressed their gratitude to the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Most of them were not so narrow-minded and they had no grudge against Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too high. It would be a pity if he remained silent.</p><p>They all had the heart to cherish talents, so they thanked the celestial Thearch. you’re welcome. I have the heart to cherish talents and will not watch the peerless prodigy fall into silence. In the next ten days, I will set up a great formation at this moment to help Lu Ming break through, but…</p><p>The celestial Thearch looked at Lu Ming and said,” “Lu Ming, I’ll make it clear first that the chances of success are not high. Also, if you don’t succeed, you can’t go to the heaven realm. Now that we’re in a war with the alien races, every resource is precious. If you can’t become a saint Emperor, the experts in the heaven realm won’t waste any resources on you.. Do you understand?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
