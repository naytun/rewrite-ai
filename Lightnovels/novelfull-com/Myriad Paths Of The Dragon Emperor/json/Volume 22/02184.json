It had completely dried up, leaving only a pitch-black cave.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>“Could this be related to the world’s metamorphosis?”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the cave and flew down.</p><p>The cave was very deep. Lu Ming kept going down. After sinking for a hundred miles, the cave actually slanted in one direction. That direction clearly led to the center of ninedragons.</p><p>Lu Ming kept flying. At last, he saw a huge passage filled with dense white fog.</p><p>Isn’t this the passageway in the center of ninedragons?</p><p>The blood pool was actually connected to the passageway in ninedragons.</p><p>“Is Jian feiliu in the other world on the other side of the tunnel?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Fie did not go in but returned the way he came.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming returned to ninedragons, he realized that the murderous aura in ninedragons was getting weaker and weaker. He believed that many people would rush into ninedragons to cultivate soon.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He left ninedragons and returned to the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming would occasionally give public lectures. Countless people from the Dragon Alliance would attend his lectures to improve their cultivation.</p><p>At the same time, Qiu Yue would also give lectures occasionally.</p><p>When everyone found out that Qiu Yue was also a martial sovereign, there was another commotion in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>With the help of resources, there were more and more Masters in the Dragon Alliance, and everyone’s cultivation was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>There were people constantly breaking through to the martial Royal realm, and there were also people constantly breaking through to the Saint realm!</p><p>The main reason was that Lu Ming’s resources were too abundant. In addition, Lu Ming also took out a large number of corpses of golden crows and God wolves.</p><p>These were the bodies of the experts from the Skywolf tower of the Golden Crow clan.</p><p>Many of them were absolute Saints, even illusionary emperors, and true emperors. The bodies of such experts would not deteriorate even after thousands of years. They could be kept fresh.</p><p>Of course, the essence Qi of a great Emperor’s body was too dense. They used the Golden Crow meat and divine wolf meat to make meat soup. Even so, it was still very nourishing. Just a bowl of it would make their bodies emit essence Qi.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming would select some people to enter the mountain and river diagram and cultivate under the path-understanding ancient tree. They would comprehend concepts and laws.</p><p>In this way, his cultivation would improve very quickly.</p><p>For example, the siblings Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou had reached the Saint realm very quickly.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s father, Lu Yuntian. Lu Ming had spent a lot of resources to make Lu Yuntian’s cultivation base skyrocket. He had rushed to the Martial Emperor realm and was constantly advancing to the sage realm.</p><p>Li Ping did not have much talent in cultivation, but with Lu Ming’s resources, she had managed to reach the spiritual God Realm. She would not be far from the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The cultivation of Hua Chi and the others had also skyrocketed.</p><p>As for Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, Yan kuangtu, and the others, their talents were already very high. The fact that they had been able to achieve so much in such an environment back then was enough to explain everything.</p><p>Now, under the support of various conditions, their cultivation had also broken through and advanced rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop either. He had been studying the alchemy Dao laws.</p><p>However, the further one cultivated the alchemy Dao laws, the slower the speed of improvement would be.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had comprehended a new law.</p><p>The laws of the artifact Dao!</p><p>The three laws derived from the Dao of inscription were the laws of array Dao, the laws of alchemy Dao, and the laws of craftsmanship!</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had comprehended all three.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the other laws that had reached perfection for the time being. He focused on comprehending the alchemy laws and the equipment laws.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two years had passed since Lu Ming returned to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In the past two years, the Dragon Alliance had been thriving and becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had also improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>The laws of alchemy had reached 90%, and the laws of craftsmanship had also reached 80%.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a huge margin compared to two years ago.</p><p>“It’s time to go to the East continent. 1 haven’t seen you for many years. 1 wonder how Senior Sister Mu Lan is doing.”</p><p>On a mountain peak, Lu Ming looked at the eastern barren territory and muttered.</p><p>In fact, he had wanted to meet Mu Lan for a long time.</p><p>However, he had been hesitating.</p><p>How could he not know Mu Lan’s thoughts? back then, Mu Lan had avoided meeting him and he did not know how to face her, so he had never seen her.</p><p>However, Mu Lan had helped him a lot back then. If it weren’t for Mu Lan’s recommendation, he wouldn’t have been able to enter the Ditian Divine Guard and wouldn’t have had his current achievements.</p><p>Now, he had made up his mind!</p><p>Since he had returned, what was the harm in meeting him?</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and headed toward the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Not long after, he arrived at the MU family’s residence.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>He arrived at the MU family and saw mu Zheng and mu Xiu Yuan.</p><p>The two of them smiled and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, he met Mu Lan’s father, mu Tian, and Mu Lan’s grandfather, Yan LAN!</p><p>“Senior Yan, senior mu!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and greeted them.</p><p>Now, the origin Qi of the eastern barren territory was extremely rich. Even if they were not very talented, their cultivation had soared a lot and could not be compared with what they had been in the past.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not put on any airs as the leader of the Dragon Alliance, they relaxed and set up a banquet to chat with him.</p><p>“Senior mu, I wonder if Senior Sister Mu Lan is here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>These words caused mu Tian, Yan LAN, mu Zheng, and mu Xiu Yuan to become silent.</p><p>Lu Ming had a bad premonition.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, what’s wrong with her?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Sigh, that girl is too stubborn!”</p><p>Yan LAN suddenly sighed.</p><p>“Senior, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. The bad premonition in his heart grew stronger.</p><p>“That girl is too headstrong. She has always wanted to catch up to you and didn’t want to fall behind too much. But with her talent, how could she catch up to you? However, the world’s metamorphosis this time has given her hope!” “Lu Ming, you must have been to ninedragons, right?” he asked.</p><p>Yan LAN sighed and finally asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Every once in a while, the killing intent in ninedragons would weaken, and people would be able to enter.</p><p>whether it’s the original Qi or the killing intent, they all come from that passage. Therefore, some people speculate that the other end of the passage must be a Supreme Holy Land for cultivation. Some people even say that whoever can enter the other side of the passage will be able to obtain a Supreme opportunity!</p><p>Yan LAN explained.</p><p>“Don’t tell me…”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of something and his heart skipped a few beats.</p><p>that’s right. That girl went into that passage alone and never came back. And that was before you came back!</p><p>Yan LAN sighed.</p><p>Mu Tian and the others also sighed.</p><p>It was said that there was an unparalleled opportunity on the other side of the passage, but those were just legends and people’s conjectures. However, Mu Lan wanted to seize this opportunity. She wanted to take a gamble.</p><p>Otherwise, she knew that she would never be able to keep up with Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s been almost six years since I left!</p><p>Mu Tian let out a long sigh. His eyes were filled with longing and worry.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, why do you have to do this?”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. At this moment, all kinds of memories about Mu Lan emerged in his mind..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
