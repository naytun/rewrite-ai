They did not hide their cold killing intent at all.</p><p>“LAN Yun, what are you guys trying to do?”</p><p>Liu Hao stepped forward and said loudly.</p><p>“What are you doing? Cripple this brat!”</p><p>LAN Yun coldly said.</p><p>The surrounding people all cast curious gazes over.</p><p>Liu Hao’s expression changed. LAN Yun, there are rules in two world city. Anyone who enters the battlefield must be United. They are not allowed to kill each other. Those who break the rules will be punished by military law. Do you want to break the rules? ”</p><p>“Haha, breaking the rules? Let me tell you, this kid is the one who broke the rules. Previously, this kid launched a sneak attack and killed an expert of the LAN family. So, I’m going to cripple him and bring him back to two world city to accept his punishment!”</p><p>LAN Yun laughed loudly.</p><p>The two world city was a huge city located at the entrance of the Hunyuan heavenly region and the taiqing heavenly region. It was magnificent and had countless powerful cultivators. It was because of the two world city that the foreign tribes ‘attack was stopped.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Hearing this, Liu Hao was stunned. If it was really as LAN Yun said, he had no reason to interfere.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke indifferently and cast a glance at LAN Yun. you and that LAN Songshi are afraid of death and want to get the treasure. So, you used me as a test stone. When you encountered the remnant soldiers left behind from the ancient times, you didn’t dare to go up to them but asked me to go up instead!</p><p>1 helped you guys take a broken weapon and wanted to leave. You guys didn’t let me go and wanted to kill me. If I don’t do anything, do 1 just wait to be killed by you?”</p><p>His words made many people’s eyes light up. So that was the case!</p><p>If they were in Lu Ming’s shoes, they would probably take action too.</p><p>“LAN Yun, if that’s really the case, then you can’t blame brother Lu for taking action!”</p><p>Liu Hao spoke again.</p><p>you’re lying. The three of us are working together to search for treasures. When we encounter a treasure, one of us naturally has to go up and test it out. If the three of us go up together and encounter danger, wouldn’t we all be annihilated?”</p><p>LAN Yun argued.</p><p>“Then why should 1 go and not you guys?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>you were the one who went up that time. The second time, we’ll definitely go up and take turns. However, you were blinded by greed and suddenly attacked us. You wanted to kill us and take the treasure for yourself. You deserve to die!</p><p>LAN Yun shouted loudly, his eyes revealing a crafty look.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. This LAN Yun was really shameless.</p><p>What taking turns? it’s all dog shit!</p><p>They clearly wanted Lu Ming to be their test. If Lu Ming wanted to leave, they would have the intention to kill him and threaten him.</p><p>1 see. Everything is clear now. This brat was greedy and wanted to kill people to steal their treasures. He killed his own people on the battlefield. This is a serious violation of the rules and must be punished!</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out from the side. It was a young man named Yan Xi, who was also a genius.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Liu Hao didn’t know whether LAN Yun was telling the truth or not, and didn’t know what to say for a moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kneel down and destroy your own cultivation. Do you still need me to do it?”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted.</p><p>“If you have the ability, then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, a large bow appearing in his hands.</p><p>you’re indeed audacious. You still want to resist? attack!</p><p>LAN Yun shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Behind LAN Yun, more than ten figures flickered and surrounded Lu Ming. Their powerful auras pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Two Seven Star void emperors and two six star void emperors …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room, revealing a cold killing intent.</p><p>The people that LAN Yun had brought were very powerful. Lu Ming was definitely not a match for them with his own abilities.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the big bow in his hands and he was not afraid of them.</p><p>If these people were looking for death, he didn’t mind killing them.</p><p>The one who gave him the pressure was Yan Xi, who had a true Emperor realm expert by her side.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, even if he had a large bow in his hands, he could not unleash such a powerful force. He was not a match for a true Emperor.</p><p>However, if he was forced into a corner, Lu Ming could directly use the celestial Thearch’s physical body to kill the other party.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not use it unless he had no other choice.</p><p>All around them, the others looked on coldly. No one said a word.</p><p>LAN Yun, aren’t you going too far? if there’s anything, we can talk about it after we return to two world city!</p><p>Liu Hao said anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming had saved his life. He could not just watch Lu Ming be crippled.</p><p>“Liu Hao, get lost. I won’t let you be captured as well!”</p><p>LAN Yun coldly rebuked.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Liu Hao’s expression was ugly. He was the one who invited Lu Ming to come along but such a thing happened. He felt terrible.</p><p>“Brother Liu, this has nothing to do with you. If they want to deal with me, they will have to pay a heavy price!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly as he poured his holy power into the bow. The bow trembled slightly and a layer of light emanated from it.</p><p>“This is an ancient Emperor weapon!”</p><p>LAN Yun’s gaze landed on the large bow and revealed a greedy expression.</p><p>The bow was full of ancient intent, and there were even spots of rust on it. It was very likely that he had obtained it from this ancient battlefield. The weapons left behind in this ancient battlefield still had spirituality, which was definitely not a small matter. This made him envious.</p><p>LAN Yun was just about to call for action when a disdainful sneer came from the sky at this moment, how despicable and shameless. He forced others to be his test stone and was killed in return. Now, he’s slandering others. The LAN family is really getting worse!</p><p>The voice was filled with disdain, causing LAN Yun and the others to change their expressions.</p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, a 14 – 15-year-old young man wearing a yin-yang Daoist robe of Tai Chi with his hands behind his back was approaching.</p><p>It was a little Taoist priest!</p><p>who are you to insult the LAN family? you’re courting death, do you understand?”</p><p>LAN Yun coldly said.</p><p>“Don’t use the LAN family to pressure me. Others may be afraid of your LAN family, but I’m not!”</p><p>The little Daoist was disdainful, and a mocking smile hung on the corner of his mouth,” “Am 1 wrong? you’re obviously forcing others to be your test stones. They will naturally resist, but you’re still framing them here. Anyone with eyes can see that you’re lying through your teeth. If the LAN family was full of people like you, they would have been destroyed long ago!”</p><p>The little Daoist had his hands behind his back and looked like a peerless expert. He squinted at LAN Yun like an elder reprimanding a junior.</p><p>he has insulted the LAN family time and time again. He’s courting death. In my opinion, this person is Lu Ming’s accomplice. Attack and cripple him first!</p><p>LAN Yun roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A middle-aged burly man from the LAN clan rushed out. He had the cultivation base of a five-star void Emperor.</p><p>With his five-star illusionary divine cultivation, it was a piece of cake to deal with a young Daoist priest.</p><p>Almost everyone thought so, except for one person, Lu Ming.</p><p>“This guy, why does he look so familiar?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the little Daoist curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming was sure that he had never seen the little Daoist’s appearance before. However, he felt that his temperament was very familiar.</p><p>At this moment, there were changes on the battlefield.</p><p>The LAN family’s five-star illusionary divine stage expert’s speed was astonishing. He rushed towards the little Daoist and with a wave of his hand, a huge palm grabbed at the little Daoist, trying to suppress him.</p><p>Just as the hand was about to grab the little Daoist, the little Daoist’s figure flashed and disappeared from his original spot. The next moment, he appeared above the middle-aged man’s head..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
