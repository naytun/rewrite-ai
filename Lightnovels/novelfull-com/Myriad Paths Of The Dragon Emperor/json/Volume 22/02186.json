This earth-shaking Dragon’s Roar actually came from the depths of the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and his eyes widened.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, there was a true dragon. It was impossible to tell how big it was, and its body was circling, covering the sky.</p><p>This true Dragon’s aura was even more shocking and difficult to fathom.</p><p>However, this true dragon had encountered a strong enemy and was fighting with a huge demonic shadow.</p><p>you won’t be able to defend this passage. In the near future, our Army will enter the primordial realm in large numbers!</p><p>A rumbling sound came from the mouth of the demonic shadow in the sky.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The true dragon let out a long roar and fought the demonic shadow.</p><p>That aura was too terrifying. Even though they were far apart, Lu Ming still felt great pressure, as if he was about to kneel down.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and gritted his teeth to withstand it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense.</p><p>“You want to stop me with just a drop of blood? kill!”</p><p>The demonic figure in the sky let out a long roar and attacked wildly, forcing the true dragon to retreat.</p><p>In the distance, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron on the back of the nine-dragon vein was fighting the two demonic shadows. It was very intense, a group of losers who tried to stop us. Kill them all!</p><p>A voice came from the distance.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw another demonic shadow. It was indomitable as it strode over. Its vast and terrifying aura made the entire world tremble.</p><p>As soon as the figure arrived, he attacked the true dragon in the sky.</p><p>The true dragon was no match for the two demonic shadows and retreated.</p><p>The direction that they were retreating in was Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was ugly as he turned to run. He wanted to rush into the void passageway and escape back to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he would encounter a great battle the moment he arrived.</p><p>Every single one of them was terrifying to the extreme. Their combat strength was unbelievably strong, even stronger than heavenly Emperor Kong Yin.</p><p>He was definitely a peerless expert.</p><p>He didn’t run. As long as a wisp of Qi hit him, he would be dead.</p><p>“Little guy, don’t run in that direction. We can’t leave this passage open. I’ll send you out!”</p><p>At this moment, an aged voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears. Then, a wave of energy enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body was thrown out.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He wanted to return to the divine wilderness. Why did he leave him behind?</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a shocking scene.</p><p>The huge true dragon suddenly turned around and slammed its huge claws on the passage. The passage shook violently, then collapsed, cracked, and collapsed.</p><p>Then, the nine huge Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons also smashed down on the passage.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The tunnel continued to collapse, and the space exploded.</p><p>“Don’t even think about destroying the passageway!”</p><p>The demonic shadows roared and suddenly attacked. Heaven and earth shook and endless gales blew.</p><p>The terrifying destructive power swept in all directions and Lu Ming was instantly swept into it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The energy shrouding his body glowed. Two small true dragons swam around continuously, blocking the energy outside. Otherwise, Lu Ming would have turned into ashes in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that even if he used the celestial Thearch’s physical body, it would be useless. He would not be able to block it.</p><p>Even so, there were still traces of vibrating energy that passed through the energy shield and acted on Lu Ming’s body, causing his body to almost explode. Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming’s bone armor made a cracking sound. Some of the bones were broken and some of the muscles were torn.</p><p>Lu Ming was severely injured and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The passageway was filled with constant explosions and Dragon roars. Terrifying energy swept out in all directions, and space was torn apart like paper before being shattered.</p><p>Lu Ming was swept away by the void energy storm. His body could not help but move away from this place. Slowly, the violent rumbles could no longer be heard.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how far he was sent flying and he fell heavily on the ground. The energy on his body had also disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming spat out another mouthful of blood and started to look around.</p><p>This was a desolate land with potholes everywhere. There was no vegetation at all. It was deathly silent and there were no living creatures.</p><p>Other than the sound of the wind, there was no other sound.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very worried.</p><p>As soon as he arrived here, he encountered such a thing. Several Supreme existences were fighting each other. If it wasn’t for that energy that enveloped him, he would have already turned into ashes.</p><p>He wondered what Mu Lan’s situation was like when she came here.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming thought of the few unparalleled existences.</p><p>It was obvious that those huge demonic shadows belonged to the evil god tribe.</p><p>The evil god tribe must have discovered the void passageway and wanted to snatch it. However, they were stopped by the nine dragon veins and the huge true dragon.</p><p>In the end, the true dragon and the nine dragon veins destroyed the passage and stopped the other party from going through.</p><p>it seems like the divine wilderness continent is connected to this place because of that passageway. The yuan Qi here is being pumped into the divine wilderness, causing the yuan Qi in the divine wilderness to be extremely rich!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered because he realized that the original energy here was extremely rich. It was even richer than the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Moreover, the space was filled with a strong killing intent, which was similar to the killing intent he felt in ninedragons.</p><p>from the looks of it, the good days of the divine wilderness continent are over!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>With the passageway destroyed, the two places could not be connected. Without the constant flow of Yuan Qi into the divine wilderness, the yuan Qi in the divine wilderness would quickly dry up and return to its original state.</p><p>However, it was still 1000 times, or even 10000 times, better than the evil god tribe invading the primordial realm through the passage.</p><p>The moment the evil god race invaded, the divine wilderness would be the first to bear the brunt of their invasion through this passageway.</p><p>An existence like that from before was too terrifying. A single slap could probably destroy the entire divine wilderness continent, and no one would be able to escape.</p><p>But now, at most, the cultivation conditions would be worse.</p><p>Moreover, the Dragon League had a large number of resources and raw gemstones left behind by Lu Ming. It was enough to cultivate for a long time.</p><p>Furthermore, the Dragon God Valley of the Cang Prefecture would send people to the divine wilderness. When the cultivation conditions in the divine wilderness became worse, some people from the Dragon Alliance could also cultivate in the Cang Prefecture.</p><p>At least, it was much better than before.</p><p>“Where is this place? Is he not in the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of another problem.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard uncle Kong, Emperor formless, and the others mention this before.</p><p>Now, out of the nine heaven domains in the heaven realm, only the Tai Qing heaven domain was left. The other eight heaven domains were all occupied by the alien races.</p><p>The heaven realm guarded the passage to the Tai Qing heavenly region and fought with the alien races for countless years, but the alien races did not invade the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>That was because out of the nine heaven regions in the heaven realm, only the taiqing heaven region had a passage that was connected to the primordial realm.</p><p>However, if this was the Tai Qing heavenly region, how did the powerful beings of the foreign tribes get in? It would definitely be blocked by the powerhouses of the heaven realm, right?</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming speculated that this was most likely not the Tai Qing heavenly region!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
