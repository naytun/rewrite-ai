He did not expect that she would really succeed and become a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Once he became an Emperor, he would be on two different levels. He would transform and improve greatly in all aspects.</p><p>The saint’s heart began to evolve into a small world, and his lifespan was endless. As long as he could survive the Tribulation of heaven and earth, he would live as long as heaven and earth.</p><p>This was an extreme transformation.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was actually in the Saint realm, the martial Saint realm.</p><p>And to become a sovereign, one would be a martial sovereign.</p><p>“Yuan Xin has proven his Dao and become a monarch. This is too shocking. His combat strength was already invincible. Now that he has proven his Dao and become a monarch, who can defeat him?”</p><p>“He’s going to sweep the world!”</p><p>he might not be. I’ve heard that the son of destiny has already become a saint</p><p>Emperor. There might be other heaven’s favorites who have become Saint emperors as well!</p><p>Some people were discussing, but they were still shocked.</p><p>To become a saint Emperor at such a young age, this was something unimaginable in the past.</p><p>A vast Emperor pressure emanated from Yuan Xin’s body, shocking everyone. Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>it seems like 1 can only reveal my identity!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>Yuan Xin had already become a monarch, so his combat strength would increase dramatically. He had to use all his strength to fight against her.</p><p>In this case, he would have to expose his identity.</p><p>Now that he was exposed, he did not want to.</p><p>After all, there were many people who wanted to kill him. If he was exposed now, Lu Xiangxiang and the others would be implicated.</p><p>Although the battle of the ten lands had already begun and they would naturally be protected by the various experts, one could not be too careful.</p><p>In the face of a high-level illusionary Emperor, Lu Ming did not have the ability to protect himself, let alone a true Emperor or great emperor.</p><p>If the energy in the celestial Thearch’s body was sufficient, Lu Ming would not have so many concerns.</p><p>Now was not the time yet.</p><p>However, facing Yuan Xin, who had become a great emperor, he had no other choice but to fight with all his might.</p><p>hahaha, Yuan Xin, you’ve become a divine Emperor. That’s great! Kill that kid! Mu yang laughed excitedly.</p><p>At the same time, he circulated his cultivation technique with all his might to heal his injuries. The injuries on his body were rapidly healing.</p><p>He then turned his gaze to Lu Xiangxiang and the others. Once he recovered, he would make them pay the price.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Xin took a step forward, and the entire fighting ring shook. A terrifying aura, like Ten Thousand Waves, pressed toward Lu Ming. “Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck with his palm and broke Yuan Xin’s aura.</p><p>“You’re putting up a stubborn resistance!”</p><p>Yuan Xin said coldly. He stood tall and exuded a vast Emperor’s might, which made him even more majestic. He was like an ancient Emperor walking in the mortal world.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>At this time, a Buddhist chant was heard. A monk walked over with a smile.</p><p>With every step he took, a Golden Lotus would appear under his feet. An extremely powerful aura emanated from his body, pressing toward Yuan Xin. This monk was naturally unscrupulous.</p><p>However, what left Lu Ming dumbfounded was that the aura that Wu Liang was emitting was clearly that of a martial Supreme.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk had already proven his Dao and become a divine Emperor. Even with Lu Ming’s wisdom, he could not help but be stunned.</p><p>This unreliable monk had already proven his Dao and become an Emperor. There was an uproar around the fighting ring. Many people were shocked. Another martial sovereign had appeared, and he was so young too. It was truly shocking.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes also revealed a hint of solemness. She looked at Wu Liang and said,” “You want to fight me?”</p><p>“If you let him go, I won’t fight you!”</p><p>Wu Ming pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Wu Liang’s entire body was covered in golden light, and a wheel of Buddhist light flashed behind his head. He put his palms together and looked solemn, like a virtuous monk.</p><p>“You know him?”</p><p>Yuan Xin said.</p><p>1 don’t know him, but he just helped those two little guys!</p><p>Wu Liang pointed at Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli and said,” the master of these two little fellows is Lu Ming. To be honest, Lu Ming and I came from the same place. He’s a little brother 1 took in in the past. So, Do you understand now?”</p><p>The monk said in all seriousness.</p><p>It was fine when he heard the first part, but when he heard the latter part, Lu Ming’s face turned black.</p><p>When did he become an unscrupulous underling?</p><p>Long Chen was also speechless.</p><p>He was old acquaintances with the unscrupulous monk. The unscrupulous monk’s cultivation base had shocked him, but his bragging skills had left him speechless.</p><p>“Then let’s fight!”</p><p>Yuan Xin was very direct as she walked toward the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His aura exploded out, shaking heaven and earth as he punched out, causing heaven and earth to shake.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>The monk chanted the name of Buddha, and his body shone with golden light.</p><p>Behind him, a loo-meter-tall Golden Buddha appeared. It reached out a</p><p>Golden Palm and struck toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a deafening boom and a terrifying energy swept out. The people nearby were sent flying. Even Lu Ming took two steps back.</p><p>the law of karma! Wu Liang has also mastered the law of karma!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>After the unscrupulous monk came to the yuan continent, he definitely had a fortuitous encounter. Or perhaps, he was already extremely talented, but he had not fully discovered it in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Chaos Divine fist!”</p><p>Yuan Xin let out a long roar, and his aura became even stronger. Like an invincible God of War, he charged toward the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>“Golden body of Buddha!”</p><p>The monk put his palms together and muttered. Behind him, the huge golden body of Buddha turned into a golden light and flew into his body. His body shone with a golden light, and even his skin turned golden. He looked like a golden man.</p><p>He used the Buddha’s giant palm print and attacked Yuan Xin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them continued to clash and fought madly on the fighting ring, sometimes on the east side, sometimes on the west side.</p><p>Many people were swept by the aftershocks of their battle and were either seriously injured or blasted off the battle platform.</p><p>Immediately, a large number of people were blasted off the fighting ring.</p><p>Some of the stronger heaven’s favorites used movement techniques to Dodge. Lu Ming, on the other hand, had his eyes on Muyang.</p><p>It was good that he had made an unscrupulous move. At least he didn’t have to be exposed for the time being.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Yang’s face was extremely ugly.</p><p>He had thought that Yuan Xin could kill Lu Ming. He did not expect that an unscrupulous person would appear. His combat strength was so shocking that he could compete with Yuan Xin.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had his eyes on him, he was extremely depressed and could only flee.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going? Why don’t you just roll off the stage yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming chased after Muyang and sneered.</p><p>Mu yang gritted his teeth, he was so angry that he almost vomited blood. He had been moving around the edge of the fighting stage. If he really couldn’t handle it, he would really jump off the fighting stage. After all, his life was more important than the opportunity.</p><p>alright, the competition is over. Everyone, stop!</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged Emperor arrived above the fighting stage.</p><p>His powerful aura made everyone stop.</p><p>The battle between Yuan Xin and Wu Liang had also stopped..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
