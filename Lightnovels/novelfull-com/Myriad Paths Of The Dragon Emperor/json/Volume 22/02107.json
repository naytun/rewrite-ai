He did not unleash the marvelousness of the law at all.</p><p>He had heard from uncle Kong that one could comprehend many laws after reaching the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Different people would naturally have different insights into the laws.</p><p>The fusion of different laws would also produce different sacred art techniques.</p><p>Those sacred art techniques contained several different laws, and their power was astonishing. It was not something a sacred art technique with a single law could compare to.</p><p>A single law sacred art could only be considered a low-grade sacred art.</p><p>Some laws contained many Sacred Arts, and their power was simply earth-shattering.</p><p>There were some ancient Sutras above the rank of a martial sovereign that had corresponding records. However, those ancient Sutras were all shockingly valuable.</p><p>there’s only a single law divine power art in the chaos Scripture. This isn’t right!</p><p>Lu Ming was reminded of the chaos Scripture.</p><p>He guessed that the chaos Scripture he had was incomplete.</p><p>Logically speaking, the chaos Scripture was the inheritance left behind by the chaos Thearch. It should not only contain low-grade superpowers but also different laws and superpowers that were fused with the chaos laws.</p><p>perhaps the chaos Scripture 1 have is really incomplete!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He didn’t have the corresponding sacred art on hand, so he could only rely on himself to explore.</p><p>He spent the rest of his time trying to figure out how to use the different laws.</p><p>Time passed quickly. Two years were almost up.</p><p>After several months of exploration, Lu Ming finally had some gains.</p><p>He realized that it was too difficult to comprehend any supernormal ability from the Laws of Chaos and the laws of death.</p><p>It wasn’t just empty talk that the strongest laws were incompatible.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still managed to create two different divine ability techniques that were shockingly powerful.</p><p>It was a combination of the chaos laws, the array Dao laws, the engulfing laws, and the extremity laws to create a magical power Technique. Lu Ming named it the chaos hammer.</p><p>When he used this move, he could form a giant hammer with shocking power.</p><p>In addition, he had fused the death law, the devouring law, the array Dao law, and the extremity law to create a child prodigy technique. Lu Ming named it the death Sword.</p><p>When it was used, it would form a combat sword that could cut through everything.</p><p>Of course, this was only the initial comprehension. The power of the various laws had not been fully displayed.</p><p>To be able to reach this stage in such a short period of time, Lu Ming’s comprehension ability was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>As he slowly cultivated and comprehended them, they would become more and more perfect. The mysteries of various nomological laws would burst out, and the power of these two moves would become stronger and stronger.</p><p>However, even though it was only an initial comprehension, it was still much stronger than simply relying on the fusion of laws.</p><p>This had greatly increased his combat strength.</p><p>In the two years since he entered this world, Lu Ming’s combat strength had improved tremendously.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful force acted on Lu Ming’s body. With his current strength, he was unable to resist this force at all. His body disappeared from where he was standing. The next moment, he found himself in a void. There was a huge door of light in front of him.</p><p>Beside him, figures kept flashing and appeared one after another.</p><p>He saw Qiu Yue, bubbles, and Feng Ling.</p><p>He also saw Yuan Xin, Mu yang, and the others.</p><p>Mu Yang’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, he was full of confidence. He had become a Martial Emperor and his strength had increased tremendously. He was 100% confident that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with confidence. Everyone had improved greatly.</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>A voice suddenly came from the sky. It sounded very old.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. They knew that the master of this world had spoken. He was definitely a terrifying expert.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of more things.</p><p>He had seen two heaven’s favorites from the heaven realm, so the master of this world must be from the heaven realm.</p><p>Everyone stepped into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>During this period, countless people had gathered on destiny mountain. There were even more people than two years ago.</p><p>That was because the two years were up and the battle of the ten lands was about to begin.</p><p>Also, how much good fortune did the 320 prodigies obtain after entering the world left behind by the primordial realm? how much did their strength increase?</p><p>Were there really many people who had already entered the Martial Emperor realm?</p><p>Everyone was very curious.</p><p>In the sky above the mountain peak, figures shrouded in divine light stood there like gods.</p><p>They were all great emperor realm experts from all over the world.</p><p>At Mount Yuan, uncle Kong had arrived and was standing with Emperor formless.</p><p>In addition, the great emperors from the Heng family, the he family, and the tianluo family had all arrived.</p><p>Not only that, the powerful forces of the various Holy Lands had also sent many experts. For example, the various powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land had sent people to participate in the first battle of the ten lands in history.</p><p>Everyone was waiting quietly.</p><p>Suddenly, a door of light appeared from the depths.</p><p>“It’s coming out!”</p><p>Everyone looked at the door of light with anticipation.</p><p>Not long after, one figure after another walked out of the light door and stood in the void.</p><p>Three hundred and twenty people, not one more, not one less.</p><p>there’s indeed great progress. Many of them have entered the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The great emperors and true emperors were all shocked.</p><p>With the cultivation bases of great emperors and true emperors, it was not difficult for them to see through the cultivation bases of Lu Ming and the rest. They could see through it with one glance.</p><p>alright, the two years are up. The ten lands battle is about to begin. Everyone, back off!</p><p>A white-haired old man stepped out and his voice spread in all directions.</p><p>He was the host of this event, an old monster from the City of Destiny.</p><p>Everyone stepped back, including the great sovereigns, leaving the destiny mountain empty.</p><p>Then, the white-haired old man waved his hand, and light spread over the destiny mountain. Stone platforms emerged out of thin air.</p><p>Each stone platform was huge, like a battle platform.</p><p>It was a total of three hundred and twenty Yuan.</p><p>the next competition is very simple. Each of you can choose a stone platform and step on it.</p><p>a formation has been set up on these stone platforms, and they naturally have their own rules of operation. After you step on them, the stone platforms will rotate and move. Whichever two stone platforms collide with each other will be the two people who will fight until the top ten are decided!</p><p>The white-haired elder announced.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes moved. So this was the rule. However, didn’t such a rule have a large part in luck?</p><p>However, many of them had confidence in their eyes.</p><p>They had enough confidence in their own strength and believed that no matter what kind of opponent they met, they would be able to defeat it.</p><p>This time, everyone had a great harvest. They were already eager to try and show off their strength in front of countless people.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Someone moved. A burly figure rushed onto a stone platform.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Next, everyone moved, each jumping onto a stone platform..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
