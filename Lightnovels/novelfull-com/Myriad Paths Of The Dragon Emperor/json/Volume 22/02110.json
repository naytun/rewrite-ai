This was extremely shocking.</p><p>Two years ago, there were only a few people who had become martial Supremes.</p><p>However, half of them had become martial sovereigns now. One could only imagine how much progress they had made in that world.</p><p>Therefore, everyone could not help but wonder how powerful those people who had become martial Supremes two years ago were.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned to the destined child, Yuan Xin, Wu Liang, and the others. These people were all martial emperors two years ago, and now, they were even more unfathomable.</p><p>They stood calmly on the stone platform. Previously, they had also made a move, but their opponents were too weak, and they were easily killed in seconds.</p><p>Many people began to re-evaluate the seeded Warriors in their hearts. They began to speculate which ten people would be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was excluded.</p><p>In the eyes of others, Lu Ming had not become a martial Supreme and had already withdrawn from the competition.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense. They were all battles between martial emperors.</p><p>Moreover, the opponents were all at least King physiques. Although many of them were one-star void emperors, their King physiques and the battle prowess of the Son of Heaven far exceeded that of ordinary one-star void emperors.</p><p>There were people being eliminated continuously.</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Li, Qiu Yue, Luo Tianyi, and the others were eliminated one after another. They had all encountered terrifying opponents, the children of God.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were also eliminated. Their cultivation was still a little weak. They had not become martial sovereigns, so it was difficult for them to compete with the sons of God who had become martial sovereigns.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all fine. At most, they were injured. Lu Ming was relieved.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Mu yang had stepped out. He was indeed powerful. A Martial Emperor with a King physique was almost blown up by him. Half of the body was turned into nothingness. The king physique struggled to get out of the stone platform and escaped death.</p><p>After Mu Yang’s victory, he threw Lu Ming a provocative look.</p><p>“Tianyun, you better pray that you don’t meet me. Otherwise, you’re dead meat!”</p><p>Mu yang sent a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at Mu yang. He ignored him.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not know if he was lucky or unlucky. For the next few days, he only went out to battle once and defeated a Martial Emperor with a King physique.</p><p>On the tenth day of the battle, there were only 50 people left.</p><p>The reason why it was so slow was mainly because many people with similar cultivation levels were fighting extremely fiercely. It was not easy to determine the winner. Some people even fought for a long time before the winner was decided. It was very tragic.</p><p>At this point, the remaining 50 people were all extremely terrifying heaven’s favorites. The remaining people didn’t have many King physiques, and most of them were the sons of God.</p><p>In the ten lands, other than the forsaken land, the other nine Lands had a few children of God in each of them. There were even more children of God in Divine Lands.</p><p>In total, there were more than 50 sons of God.</p><p>More than 50 sons of God had gathered in an era. This was something that had never happened in the primordial realm.</p><p>Legend had it that such a Grand occasion had only appeared in the heaven realm in the distant past.</p><p>Of the remaining fifty people, Lu Ming was the only one at the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“That Emperor-to-be is called tianyun?”</p><p>that’s right, his name is tianyun. His luck is pretty good, and he hasn’t encountered anyone too strong.</p><p>well, his luck has come to an end. There are almost no weaklings next. His combat strength is amazing among those of the same level, but his cultivation is too weak. He has not broken through to the Emperor realm and will be eliminated in the end!</p><p>In the surroundings, some people were discussing and expressing their opinions.</p><p>At this moment, two more stone platforms collided.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Even Lu Ming had a look of anticipation.</p><p>One of them was an ancient devil.</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that the ancient devil cultivated the primordial diabolism and its combat strength was extremely powerful. After four to five years, the ancient devil must have become even more amazing and its combat strength must be unfathomable.</p><p>The other person was definitely not weak either. He was also a Son of God. Just like Lu Xiangxiang, he had also mastered the laws of life and had also broken through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>This would be a battle between the strong.</p><p>The two of them didn’t waste any words and directly attacked.</p><p>The Son of God controlled the laws of life. With a wave of his hand, vines as thick as arms filled the sky.</p><p>Each vine was incomparably tough, like a divine sword, and their killing power was astonishing.</p><p>But ancient devil was stronger. His body was covered in a layer of demonic light. The demonic light formed a saber in his hand. He killed his way through the sky of vines. As the saber fell, the vines were broken.</p><p>Some of the vines that wrapped around his body were directly shattered by the demonic light on his body.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong!</p><p>The ancient devil had the absolute advantage as soon as he attacked. He broke through all the obstacles and attacked his opponent.</p><p>The other party had used all his strength, but he was also at a disadvantage and was difficult to match.</p><p>This made many people stunned and in disbelief.</p><p>what’s going on with him? why can’t I sense any nomological laws fluctuations from him?”</p><p>Some of the young men who had never heard of the ancient cultivation system cried out in surprise.</p><p>this should be the immemorial cultivation system, the immemorial demonic Dao!</p><p>An elder spoke up and explained, causing many people to be shocked and somewhat dejected. Was the ancient cultivation system so powerful that it actually suppressed the Son of Heaven to the point where he couldn’t even raise his head?</p><p>don’t be discouraged. The current nomological system is flourishing, so it naturally has its advantages. The primordial cultivation system isn’t that easy to cultivate!</p><p>that’s right. The ancient cultivation system has extremely harsh conditions for cultivation. Not every ancient cultivation system is so powerful. Ancient devil is obviously a peerless genius who cultivates the ancient diabolism!</p><p>Some of the older generation explained to prevent the younger generation from being discouraged.</p><p>Ancient Devil’s attacks were getting more and more violent. The demonic light on his body was extremely condensed. It could break anything. It kept breaking through the opponent’s attacks and defenses.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the two exchanged dozens of blows. The other party was no match and was sent flying by the ancient devil.</p><p>A Son of God who had stepped into the Martial Emperor realm had been defeated.</p><p>The Son of Heaven had always been the synonym of invincibility. Apart from the other geniuses who were also a Son of Heaven, no one could match him. But today, he was defeated by a genius of the ancient devil path.</p><p>this ancient devil is too strong. His attack power is unparalleled. He has a high chance of entering the top ten!</p><p>that’s right. He might have a place in the top ten!</p><p>Many people thought highly of ancient devil.</p><p>After a few more battles, the remaining few King physiques all lost and were eliminated.</p><p>“Bubbles is about to make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He saw bubble’s stone platform move forward and collide with another stone platform.</p><p>“Such a small child, he can’t be a human, right?”</p><p>Someone looked at bubbles. She was about two to three years old and looked extremely adorable.</p><p>Some of the young ladies ‘eyes lit up as they looked at her, wishing that they could hug her in their arms and make love to her.</p><p>“She’s not a human. This little girl’s background is very shocking!”</p><p>An elder spoke. He was a great emperor who could see through bubbles ‘true form..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
