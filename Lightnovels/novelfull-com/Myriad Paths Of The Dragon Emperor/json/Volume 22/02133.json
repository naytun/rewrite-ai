He was not confident in facing the gray-robed young man, but he had clearly stated that he wanted to challenge him, so he could not avoid the battle.</p><p>Yuan Xin stepped forward, and the aura on her body burst out. Two types of nomological laws spread out.</p><p>The gray-robed youth seemed to be surprised, you’ve already comprehended two nomological laws and successfully fused them. Not bad. 1 wonder how your combat strength is?”</p><p>1’11 let you see it, chaotic divine body!</p><p>Facing the gray-robed young man, Yuan Xin didn’t dare to be careless. He immediately used his most powerful killing move, the chaotic divine body.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body was covered in the color of chaos, as if he was made of chaos stone. His aura had reached its peak.</p><p>interesting. Make your move and let me see your strength. Don’t worry, 1 will still suppress my cultivation to two-star void Emperor!</p><p>The gray-robed youth’s eyes revealed a faint smile and a trace of interest. However, he did not panic at all.</p><p>Such an attitude was undoubtedly very contemptuous.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes were filled with anger. With a roar, she stepped into the void and charged toward the gray-robed young man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin threw a punch at the gray-robed young man. His fist was like a chaotic stone.</p><p>The gray-robed young man extended his palm. In his palm, another primordial chaos cauldron formed. It rapidly grew to the size of a mountain.</p><p>The gray-robed young man waved his hand, and the primordial chaos cauldron pressed toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s punch landed on the primordial chaos cauldron. The cauldron shook violently, and the sound waves swept out in all directions. Many experts emitted light and blocked the sound waves.</p><p>Yuan Xin had also suffered a terrifying impact. His body trembled and he kept retreating, causing the void to explode.</p><p>not bad. You can block one of my moves. You have some strength. Let’s see how many moves you can block!</p><p>The gray-robed young man said. He seemed to be a little surprised. Then, he pressed down with one hand, and the primordial chaos cauldron blasted toward Yuan Xin.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Yuan Xin roared and kept punching with both fists like a storm.</p><p>However, what was unbelievable was that after each move, Yuan Xin would retreat rapidly. He was completely outmatched and was suppressed. After more than ten moves, he retreated a few hundred meters and blood spurted our of his mouth.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man muttered, and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. He pressed down with one hand again, and the cauldron shook and became even bigger, pressing down on Yuan Xin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Yuan Xin was even more miserable. Her body fell down and smashed into the fighting ring on the top of destiny mountain, causing a violent boom.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>In the primordial realm, many young geniuses shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, was a peerless genius. This time, she ranked third among all the geniuses in the primordial realm.</p><p>Even such an expert had been defeated. Moreover, he had been defeated so easily and easily suppressed.</p><p>The key point was that the other party had already suppressed his cultivation to the level of a two-star illusionary Emperor, but he could still easily suppress Yuan Xin.</p><p>What was going on? The son of chaos was invincible among those of the same level. How could he be suppressed so badly by his opponent?</p><p>second realm of laws. The opponent’s laws have already reached the second realm!</p><p>A powerful true Emperor spoke.</p><p>the second realm of laws? 11</p><p>Some people did not understand.</p><p>Immediately, an elder explained.</p><p>Laws, after cultivating to the level of Emperor-to-be, would reach perfection and become a River of laws.</p><p>However, this so-called perfection only referred to the perfection of a certain stage. To be exact, it was only the perfection of the first realm of laws.</p><p>The cultivation of laws was divided into three realms.</p><p>After breaking through to rhe Martial Emperor realm, some powerhouses could make another breakthrough in their laws and cultivate them to the second or even Third Realm.</p><p>Of course, the difficulty was extremely shocking. However, once one broke through, the power would also be shocking.</p><p>Once he broke through to the second realm, the power of his laws would increase greatly.</p><p>Even if ir was a King path law, after stepping into the second realm, it could contend with an ultimate law.</p><p>The gray-robed youth’s primordial chaos laws had already reached the second realm. In a battle at the same level, he could naturally easily defeat the son of chaos.</p><p>However, according to the older generation, only high-level void emperors could cultivate the laws to the second realm. Some people could not break through in their entire lives.</p><p>As for the other party, he had broken through to the second realm of primordial chaos laws at such a young age. It was truly astonishing.</p><p>the primordial realm’s prodigies are truly flowers in a greenhouse. They can’t even withstand a single blow. How boring!</p><p>The gray-robed young man looked down at Yuan Xin and spoke indifferently, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The prides of the primordial realm were all furious. It was really uncomfortable to be looked down upon like this.</p><p>However, the other party’s combat strength was too shocking. Even Tianming and Lu Ming would be defeated. Therefore, they could do nothing but swallow their anger when they were looked down upon by the other party.</p><p>The gray-robed young man seemed to have lost interest and returned to the chariot.</p><p>At this moment, a woman walked out.</p><p>This woman was wearing a suit of iron armor. She looked heroic and was full of killing intent.</p><p>She glanced at Lu Ming and the rest. 1 heard that the primordial realm has given birth to a child of fate. I’m very curious about how wonderful the nomological laws of fate are. Do you dare to fight me? ”</p><p>Tianming’s eyes flickered. The other party directly challenged the destined child, so he could only accept the challenge.</p><p>Tianming stepped out, his white clothes fluttering in the wind. He looked at the heroic-looking woman and said,” “I am the child of destiny!”</p><p>“What’s your cultivation level?”</p><p>The heroic-looking woman said.</p><p>“Two-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Tianming said.</p><p>“TWo-star void Emperor, just as well, I’m also a two-star void Emperor!”</p><p>The heroic-looking woman spoke, and the aura of laws emanated from her body.</p><p>“The law of the king path, you have a King physique?”</p><p>Tianming was stunned, and a trace of displeasure flashed through his eyes.</p><p>The other party actually had the physique of a King, and the physique of a King actually dared to challenge him. This was underestimating him.</p><p>so what if you have the king physique? even a King physique can defeat you!</p><p>The heroic-looking woman’s aura became even sharper. A long spear appeared in her hand. The long spear stirred up the wind and clouds as she stabbed toward Tianming.</p><p>As the long spear stabbed out, the aura of the heroic-looking woman rose sharply, revealing her sharp edge. She was like an invincible goddess of war. “Great fate technique!”</p><p>Tianming didn’t dare to underestimate his enemy. He used the great fate technique and turned into a rainbow light, attacking the heroic woman.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>feNbsp; the light of fate collided with the spear, creating astonishing ripples.</p><p>The heroic-looking woman was successfully blocked.</p><p>a second realm law. However, a second realm King path law is not my match either!</p><p>Tianming shouted and launched a counterattack.</p><p>He could tell that his opponent’s nomological laws had already reached the second realm. However, he cultivated the nomological laws of fate, while his opponent was only a King’s Dao law. He had no fear and could crush his opponent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>the Heaven’s Will finger continued to point, sending beams of destiny light at the enemy.</p><p>“If one doesn’t work, then two, then three!”</p><p>The heroic-looking woman said coldly. Her aura had become even stronger. Three types of nomological laws burst forth, and she had completely mastered them.</p><p>three kinds of King path laws, and two of them have already reached the second realm. How is it possible at such a young age? ”</p><p>A true Emperor with snow-white hair roared in disbelief.</p><p>He had lived for a long time and knew very well how difficult it was to reach this step..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
