It was all because of Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, everyone’s respect for Lu Ming grew.</p><p>It only took a few months for fatty, Zhuang Xiaoshan, and the others to increase their cultivation and combat power so much that they could easily suppress Ren qianxing and the others. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>They thought of that sentence again!</p><p>A legend was still a legend!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming cast his gaze at the divine ox Palace’s master of the manlong Dragon Hall.</p><p>“We pay our respects to Alliance Master Lu!”</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace and the manlong Hall felt a chill run down his spine. He put on an ugly smile and came over to greet Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, they had wanted to run away. However, Lu Ming was too terrifying. Where could they run to? Lu Ming would probably catch up to them and kill them.</p><p>Therefore, he might as well stay behind and express his goodwill to Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m very curious. Where are you from in the yuan continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the leaders of the two forces.</p><p>“Alliance Master Lu, I’m from the land of the divine beasts!”</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace said.</p><p>“I’m from the land of the heavenly Berserkers!”</p><p>The manlong Dragon Hall Master said.</p><p>“How did you guys get here? Why would he suddenly come to such a remote place like the divine wilderness continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>He was very curious about this, and he wanted to know.</p><p>If they could come, so could the others. Lu Ming was very worried about this.</p><p>It would be troublesome if a stronger existence, such as a high-level illusionary Emperor or a true Emperor, came.</p><p>I once found an ancient map by chance. The ancient map recorded that in the desolate land, there was a paradise. The cultivation environment was much better than many sacred grounds in the yuan continent. I followed the map and found an ancient teleportation array. That was how 1 came to the divine wilderness!</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace said.</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>The master of manlong Hall nodded, similar to the master of divine ox Palace.</p><p>“Where’s your map? let me see!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace and the hall Master of the manlong Hall looked at each other. Then, they each took out a jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>These were the two overlords of the yuan continent. Previously, they were the overlords of the divine wilderness continent. But now, they were like two servants, trembling in fear in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The difference between before and after was too great.</p><p>This made countless people sigh!</p><p>Lu Ming took the two Jade talismans and scanned them with his spiritual senses. Indeed, they were two ancient maps.</p><p>“Other than you guys, no one else knows?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“No, I didn’t tell anyone! He only brought a few of his subordinates to the divine wilderness!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>The two of them shook their heads.</p><p>The two of them were also ordinary Emperor-level forces in the yuan continent, similar to the monarch race.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Alliance Master Lu, since you are back, how about we split the divine wilderness equally with the Dragon Alliance? ”</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace looked at Lu Ming carefully and suggested.</p><p>“You guys still want to split up the divine wilderness?” Lu Ming said with a half-smile.</p><p>The master of the divine ox Palace and the manlong Palace Master both had ugly expressions.</p><p>Finally, the master of divine ox Palace gritted his teeth and said,” Alliance Master Lu, I’m willing to join the Dragon Alliance in the future and serve you!</p><p>“I’m also willing!”</p><p>They had no choice but to lower their heads when they were under the roof.</p><p>“Oh, join the Dragon Alliance?”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his chin and muttered to himself.</p><p>“Yes, that’s good…”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The master of divine ox Palace and man long hall were overjoyed, but a cold light flashed in the depths of their eyes.</p><p>As long as they could stabilize Lu Ming, they would send people back to Yuan continent and invite more experts. By then, they did not believe that they could not kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming made his move.</p><p>It was so sudden that the Masters of the divine ox Palace and the Savage Dragon Palace were caught off guard.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palms twice in a row, hitting the two of them. Their bodies were pierced, and the terrifying destructive power gushed into them.</p><p>The two of them widened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>I still believe in the dead. At the Martial Emperor realm, the power of an oath is already too weak. If you secretly return to the yuan continent later and find stronger experts, I will put myself in danger. So, you should all die!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Then, the power of his palm exploded, and the Masters of the two forces were turned into ashes.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The remaining people of the two forces were shocked. Some of them reacted and tried to escape.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After killing the two forces ‘leaders, Lu Ming did not stop at all. He immediately charged at the two forces’ leaders.</p><p>There were also Martial Emperor powerhouses in these two forces. However, they could not withstand a single blow from Lu Ming and were killed in an instant.</p><p>Following that, those below the martial Supreme realm did not manage to escape either. They were all killed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This scene was shocking!</p><p>The three major powers of the yuan continent that had dominated the divine wilderness for many years had been annihilated because of Lu Ming’s return. “We pay our respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>At this moment, everyone from the Dragon League knelt down to pay their respects to Lu Ming.</p><p>They understood that the Dragon Alliance was about to unify the divine wilderness again.</p><p>No one could match him!</p><p>As for those who weren’t from the Dragon Alliance or those who had betrayed the Dragon Alliance, they were all trembling.</p><p>“From today onwards, the Dragon Alliance will be rebuilt and reorganized!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard by everyone.</p><p>leave all of this to Xie Luan and Xia Jiuyang… Deal with these people, I’ll go and get rid of the remaining forces of the three great factions!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, he took a step forward and rushed into the depths of the Imperial Dragon City. He began to spread out his spiritual consciousness to search for the remnants of the sovereign race and the evil god race. As long as he found them, he would kill them on the spot.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming rushed to the eastern barren territory to kill the remaining members of the divine ox Palace. Then, he came to the southern underworld to kill the remaining members of the manlong Palace.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming rushed to the overseas area.</p><p>The ancient teleportation formation that connected the continents of the divine Ruins to the yuan continent was not only in the ancient city of the divine Ruins. There were also teleportation formations on other continents. Lu Ming wanted to find and destroy all of them to prevent experts from the yuan continent from coming again.</p><p>In the following month, Lu Ming walked around the divine Ruins ‘continents and found more than a dozen teleportation altars. All of them were destroyed by Lu Ming, leaving only the teleportation arrays that led to the Azure continent, cloud continent, and the Emperor continent.</p><p>At this time, the Dragon Alliance had been reorganized. Some people who had betrayed the Dragon Alliance because of the arrival of the yuanlu forces had been dealt with. However, there were more people who joined the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had returned and killed the three major forces of the yuan continent, everyone was shocked.</p><p>It could be said that with Lu Ming in charge of the Dragon Alliance, it was the true Overlord and no one could shake it.</p><p>Many experts had joined the Dragon League.</p><p>The Imperial Dragon City was being rebuilt again. When Lu Ming returned to the Imperial Dragon City, another huge statue of Lu Ming was erected.</p><p>It was bigger and more majestic than before!</p><p>After Lu Ming returned, he held a grand banquet and brought Li Ping, Lu Yuntian, and the others back to the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming took over the Imperial Dragon City and handed over a large number of resources to Xie Luan and the others.</p><p>For example, there were all sorts of domain-level martial arts techniques, divine abilities, orirocks, and pills. Xie Luan and the others were ecstatic. With these, their cultivation speed would skyrocket, and their combat power would also be stronger..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
