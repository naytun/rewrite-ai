Back to the divine wilderness!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and held Qiu Yue’s hand. They flew down the altar and headed south.</p><p>But suddenly, Lu Ming stopped, his face filled with bewilderment.</p><p>“Young master, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Qiu Yue asked in surprise.</p><p>“Qiuyue, have you noticed that there’s something wrong with this place? the origin Qi is too dense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a look of shock on his face.</p><p>the original Qi is indeed rich. It’s not any weaker than that of the Azure continent, cloud continent, and Emperor continent!</p><p>Qiu Yue sensed and said.</p><p>although the origin Qi in the divine Ruins continent is richer than that of the divine wilderness continent, it can not be compared to the yuan continent at all. The difference is huge, but now, the origin Qi concentration here is actually comparable to that of the Azure continent!</p><p>The more he said, the more incredulous Lu Ming felt.</p><p>The continent cluster of the divine Ruins was located in the barren land of the primordial realm’s ten lands. It lacked original energy, and the space was extremely unstable. The difference between it and the primordial land was too great, and they could not be compared at all.</p><p>But now, the concentration of the original Qi here was comparable to that of the Azure region. Lu Ming could not be wrong.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and struck the air. The space rippled like water.</p><p>the space has also become countless times more stable. How is this possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more shocked.</p><p>The continent cluster of the divine Ruins was located at the edge of the primordial realm, and the space was extremely unstable.</p><p>Here, even spiritual God Realm martial artists could break open the space.</p><p>As for those at the martial Royal realm, a casual move from them could destroy the space.</p><p>When Lu Ming was here, he could cross hundreds of millions of miles to kill his enemies.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming did not use much strength when he waved his palm just now, if it were in the past, Lu Ming would have pierced through the endless space.</p><p>But now, it was just a ripple.</p><p>The space was much more stable than before. It was very close to Yuan continent.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sensed the heaven and earth and realized that the laws were many times clearer.</p><p>Cultivating in such an environment, one’s cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Just like the Cang state, cloud state, and the Emperor state, there were many martial emperors. There were even people in the bright Saint, Supreme Saint, absolute Saint, and Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>What had happened in the divine Ruins continent all these years?</p><p>How could there be such a shocking change?</p><p>It was a complete upheaval. A remote and desolate place had suddenly become a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue had also figured out the difference, and she was also dumbfounded.</p><p>the divine Ruins ‘continents must have undergone a huge change. Let’s return to the divine wilderness continent first!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>The two of them rose into the air and flew towards the South of the ancient city of the divine Ruins at extreme speed.</p><p>If it was in the past, they could travel through the void at will. With their current cultivation level, they would probably be able to travel from the divine Ruins continent to the divine wilderness continent in a few minutes.</p><p>But now, the space was much more stable, just like in the yuan continent. They could no longer travel through the void.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After flying for some distance, they heard a deafening battle cry from ahead.</p><p>There seemed to be thousands of soldiers and horses ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed, and the two of them continued to fly. Not long after, they arrived at the edge of the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>He saw countless figures standing on the city wall.</p><p>In the air, some people were fighting.</p><p>“Eh? Seventh level Martial Emperor realm, eighth level Martial Emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and noticed that the people fighting in the air were all experts at the seventh or eighth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Also, there were many martial Royal realm experts among those who had not made a move.</p><p>This would have been unimaginable in the past.</p><p>Before Lu Ming left the continent group of the divine Ruins, the strongest expert on the continent of the divine Ruins was a fourth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Moreover, when Lu Ming left, he had almost killed all the martial emperors at the third level and above.</p><p>But now, with just a casual glance, he could tell that they were at least at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>As expected, this world was different. The origin Qi was rich and the laws were clear. Countless experts had been born.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue did not stop. They continued to fly forward. He finally understood what had happened.</p><p>Outside the ancient city of the divine Ruins, there were also countless silhouettes. Many silhouettes were wearing iron armors, and their battle intent soared to the sky. It was very obvious that these were two groups of people fighting.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not interested in that. He and Qiu Yue stepped out of the city wall.</p><p>hey, you two, which family are you from? don’t wander around. The enemy is outside the city. If you go out, you will die!</p><p>Someone looked at the two of them and reminded them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear him and continued to walk out.</p><p>“I’ve never seen these two before!”</p><p>“I don’t know which family he’s from, he’s really looking for death!”</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue and sneered, but no one stopped them.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue left the ancient city of the divine Ruins and flew South.</p><p>“These two came from the city, take them down!”</p><p>he’s actually so bold. Is he trying to provoke us? ”</p><p>Someone in the Army outside the city said angrily.</p><p>The people outside the city naturally treated Lu Ming and Qiu Yue as people inside the city.</p><p>Now that the two of them had walked out like this, as if they didn’t care about them, it made them furious.</p><p>Immediately, two people flew toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. Each of them extended a large hand to grab Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>These two were Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts. In the past, they would have been overlords.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation level, a casual shout from him contained great power. The two third-level martial Royal realm experts trembled violently and were sent flying back while spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“So it’s two experts. Kill them!”</p><p>how arrogant. Do you think you can challenge us with just the two of you? ”</p><p>Many people in the Army outside the city were furious, and more experts flew out.</p><p>There were at least a dozen of them, and some of them were at Lv 7 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Their eyes were cold, and their killing intent was as sharp as a knife.</p><p>There were even a few people who looked at Qiu Yue with eyes full of passion and greed.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward. The sky rumbled and terrifying energy swept out.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The bodies of the dozen or so people who had rushed over directly exploded and died on the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have a good impression of these people from the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>Back then, all the forces in the divine Ruins continent had joined forces to hunt down Lu Ming in order to seize his primordial chaos token. If Lu Ming’s cultivation was not so high, he would have died long ago.</p><p>Therefore, he did not show any mercy.</p><p>In one move, he had killed more than a dozen experts, shocking everyone.</p><p>“How could this be? Could he be a Sage?”</p><p>“That’s impossible, right? Our Divine Ruins continent has yet to give birth to a Saint realm expert. The strongest is only a half-Saint!”</p><p>is he a half-Saint? ”</p><p>The Army outside the city discussed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
