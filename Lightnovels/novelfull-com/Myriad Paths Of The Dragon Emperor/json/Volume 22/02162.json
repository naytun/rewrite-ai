He shocked the people outside the city and made them look terrible.</p><p>Even the battle in the sky had stopped. The experts from both sides flew back to their respective camps.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you’ve crossed the line!”</p><p>A middle-aged man descended from the sky and stared at Lu Ming. A powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>the second stage of half-Saint!</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly sense the other party’s cultivation.</p><p>it seems that the world’s metamorphosis has been going on for a long time. Even a figure at the second stage of the half-Saint realm has appeared!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“Come here, I have some questions for you!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked at the second stage half-Saint and said indifferently,”</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, a second stage half-Saint was really nothing. His tone naturally did not have any respect. It even sounded like he was giving orders.</p><p>When the other party heard this, his face turned extremely dark.</p><p>“You and I have an agreement that half-Saints can’t interfere. You’ve crossed the line!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“I called you over, I have something to ask you!”</p><p>Lu Ming added, his expression turning cold.</p><p>He did have a stomach full of questions and wanted to find someone to ask.</p><p>“Arrogant. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>The middle-aged man was furious. He unleashed all his strength and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the second stage of the half-Saint realm, he had already mastered the laws. In the eyes of others, he was powerful and terrifying. However, in Lu Ming’s eyes, he was no different from an ant.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a hand and a large hand condensed. He grabbed the middle-aged man and exerted force. The middle-aged man screamed in pain. His body crackled and many bones were broken.</p><p>Both inside and outside the city were silent.</p><p>A half-Saint was like a baby in Lu Ming’s hands. He was vulnerable.</p><p>After that, the people in the city were overjoyed and their morale was greatly boosted.</p><p>“Take this opportunity to attack and exterminate the other party!”</p><p>“That’s right, kill our way out!”</p><p>How could the higher-ups in the city miss this opportunity?</p><p>Lu Ming had walked out of the city and killed the strong opponents in a row. Even a half-Saint could not withstand a single blow. As a result, the morale of the other party must be very low. This was the best opportunity to attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Within the city, a large group of experts charged out, killing their way out of the city.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>He didn’t come to help the city. He attacked because the other party attacked him first and then he wanted to ask some questions.</p><p>However, the people in the city wanted to use his power and treat him as a thug.</p><p>“All of you, get back!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and shouted.</p><p>Waves of terrifying energy burst out of his mouth and rushed toward the Masters in the city.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the city, the Masters who were at the forefront of the charge kept exploding in the air, and dozens of them died in an instant.</p><p>“All, retreat!”</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The rest of the people were almost scared to death. They retreated frantically, their bodies covered in cold sweat.</p><p>Now, everyone understood that Lu Ming did not belong to either side.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming stretched out his large hand into the city and grabbed an elder.</p><p>Everyone gasped. This elder was also a half-Saint, and he was the top powerhouse of the current continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>“You … You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The old man stared at Lu Ming and suddenly shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. In the depths of their memories, a demonic name emerged.</p><p>Lu Ming had shaken the entire Divine Ruins continent more than ten years ago. Who did not know him?</p><p>At that time, the divine Ruins continent’s top group of experts were almost completely wiped out.</p><p>“It’s really Lu Ming. I recognize him!”</p><p>Someone else shouted.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming first appeared, many people did not recognize him.</p><p>After all, more than ten years had passed. Lu Ming’s temperament had changed greatly. Many people had not realized it.</p><p>But now that he had reminded them, many people reacted and their faces turned pale.</p><p>This was a jinx.</p><p>And wasn’t he heading to the yuan continent? Why did he come back?</p><p>Did he just return from the yuan continent?</p><p>Many people had figured it out. This must be the reason why they had appeared in the city.</p><p>“I’ll ask you some questions. If you answer me honestly, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Alliance Master Lu, please ask. We’ll definitely tell you everything we know!</p><p>The old man in the city quickly said.</p><p>“Me too, me too!”</p><p>The middle-aged man also nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current abilities were simply unfathomable. They did not dare to have any disloyal thoughts.</p><p>“Let me ask you, what is going on with this world? Why is the origin Qi so dense, countless times denser than it was in the past?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>As expected, he had just returned from the yuan continent.</p><p>“Alliance Master Lu, it’s like this …”</p><p>The old man in the city quickly answered. He told them everything that had happened in the past few years, and the middle-aged man added some more.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked after hearing that.</p><p>So all of this was because of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>To be more precise, it was because of the divine wilderness continent’s East barren, ninedragons.</p><p>About eight or nine years ago, there was a sudden change in Nine Dragons city in the eastern wilderness. A passage suddenly appeared in the middle of Nine Dragons city. The nine dragon veins and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that suppressed the city flew away one by one into the passage.</p><p>And in that passageway, there was an endless amount of origin Qi that seeped out, causing the origin Qi of the divine wilderness continent to become extremely dense. It even spread to the surrounding continents, such as the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>In fact, with the density of the origin Qi, the laws of heaven and earth in this area became very clear and easy to comprehend.</p><p>At the same time, the space between heaven and earth became extremely stable.</p><p>With every dragon vein and Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that flew away, more original Qi would gush out of the passage.</p><p>In addition, the divine wilderness continent and other continents, deep underground, seemed to have countless spiritual roots or the seeds of sacred medicine. Now that the origin Qi had become more concentrated, these spiritual roots and sacred medicine seeds had all been revived. They bloomed and bore fruit. All over the world, countless spiritual medicines and sacred medicines appeared.</p><p>During this time, the world of martial Dao had also been strengthened explosively.</p><p>Everyone’s cultivation improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Especially in the divine wilderness continent, there were many experts. Not only were there martial emperors, even the Saint realm had appeared one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were dumbfounded.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the change of the world was actually related to the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The entire world had recovered and was full of vitality.</p><p>“Could it be that the legend about the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Legend had it that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was forged by human powerhouses in ancient times to suppress the nine dragon veins.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming speculated that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the nine dragon veins were one and used to suppress the passage.</p><p>“Where does that tunnel lead to?”</p><p>Many thoughts and questions appeared in Lu Ming’s mind..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
