All kinds of attacks were launched at Lu Ming like beams of divine light, trying to drown him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm was enough to destroy these attacks. He walked past them and headed toward the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>Earlier on, Lu Ming could have killed the sect master of the sky demon sect and the others in one move. However, he did not do so. He wanted to let them know what despair was.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, eighteen puppets appeared, all of them at the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>The 18 puppets charged forward with sabers in their hands.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Immediately, a large number of evil spirit and di family people were killed, and their bodies fell to the ground.</p><p>The evil spirit cult and the DI family were horrified. Eighteen Emperor-to-be puppets were too terrifying.</p><p>The 18 Emperor-to-be puppets were not afraid of death. They continued to attack. Even if the other party was also an Emperor-to-be, they couldn’t stop them. People below the Emperor-to-be realm were constantly killed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>At the back, Longyuan mountain and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>They knew that they could not interfere in this battle. Therefore, they did not do anything. They also knew that if they did, they might distract Lu Ming. “Block these puppets!”</p><p>“Let’s join forces to block it!”</p><p>The DI family and the evil spirit cult roared loudly. All their Emperor-to-be had moved out. Together with some Supreme Saints, they finally stopped the eighteen puppets.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and walked toward the sect master of the sky demon sect. “Attack and kill this bastard!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The sect masters of the sky demon sect and the tianshen sect shouted. They were being supported by people. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even be able to fly. Immediately, some people charged at Lu Ming. He stretched out his hand and pointed. Streams of finger force burst forth, piercing the space between their eyebrows.</p><p>Corpses fell to the ground one after another.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect and the others were shocked, and they quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming followed them step by step. His eyes were cold and his cold killing intent was locked on the sect master and the others. He wanted to make them despair.</p><p>Every inch closer he got to the other party, the other party’s face became uglier. “You’re all dead today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Right at this moment, a shocking aura burst out from the depths of the DI family. A beam of black light shot up into the sky, and a vast aura spread out in all directions.</p><p>Emperor might!</p><p>Another martial sovereign had appeared!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A brutal voice was heard. In the next moment, the figure had already appeared above Lu Ming and the others. A terrifying aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three-eyed God race!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The martial sovereign that appeared was not the DI family’s patriarch, Di Shi Tian, but a member of rhe three-eyed God race.</p><p>This three-eyed God was five meters tall and was shrouded in a pitch-black light. Ordinary people would not be able to see his full appearance. However, Lu Ming s eyesight was so good that he could see through the light and see the other party’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to see a three-eyed God at the Martial Emperor realm, looks like the evil spirit religion was indeed created by a foreign race. Looks like this three-eyed God race is a remnant of the evil race that came through that passage!</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it and understood.</p><p>Almost all of the three-eyed God race members who had come through that passage had been killed.</p><p>In particular, those true emperors and void emperors with profound cultivation bases were all slaughtered.</p><p>Even the great emperors were targeting the great emperors, but there was no guarantee that no one would escape.</p><p>It was clear that this three-eyed God was a fish that had escaped the net and escaped here.</p><p>This place was too secluded, so naturally, no one was chasing after him.</p><p>“I wonder if there are even stronger three-eyed gods!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>Logically speaking, the high-level illusionary emperors and true Emperor realm foreign races were almost all killed by the great emperor. There shouldn’t be such a high-level three-eyed God race that would escape here. “Not good, it’s a Martial Emperor!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master, Longyuan mountain, yang tianzong and the others were all shocked.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, could he face a Martial Emperor?</p><p>The sect Masters of the Tian Yu demon sect and the tianshen sect were ecstatic.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to hell. Haha!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect laughed maniacally.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming was, could he be stronger than a Martial Emperor?</p><p>So what if they had some Emperor-to-be puppets? they would still die in the face of a Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three-eyed God bellowed. A huge axe appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm and he had no intention of dodging.</p><p>He had already seen that this three-eyed God race was only equivalent to a one – star void Emperor.</p><p>Just as the huge axe was about to hit him, Lu Ming struck out with his palm. Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck the other party’s battleaxe. The battleaxe trembled and was sent flying, while Lu Ming’s figure remained motionless.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned!</p><p>Lu Ming could actually send a Martial Emperor’s axe flying with a single palm strike. Moreover, he was unarmed.</p><p>The grandmasters of the sky demon sect and the tianshen sect widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were also dumbfounded. Initially, they had ail sorts of speculations. Some guessed that Lu Ming had a backup plan, that he had invited other experts, or that he had some secret treasure. However, no one had guessed that Lu Ming could fight a martial Supreme with his own combat strength.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming was too young. How could he be a match for a Martial Emperor at such a young age?</p><p>This was not realistic!</p><p>However, what happened next made them feel like they were in an illusion, the fish that escaped the net from the evil god tribe will be eliminated today! Lu Ming shouted and soared into the sky, charging at his opponent, die! the other party shouted and used all his strength. A destructive light shot out from his third eye towards Lu Ming, but it was sent flying by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm broke through the opponent’s defense and landed on his body, arghh! the other party screamed as his burly body exploded into pieces.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>Many people’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. They couldn’t believe it and thought they were dreaming.</p><p>A Martial Emperor was directly blown up by Lu Ming’s bare hands. He was smashed into pieces with one palm.</p><p>It was too illusory, like a myth.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect cried out hysterically, unable to accept this.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful that he could kill a Martial Emperor with one move? he did not dare to imagine this.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were also stunned. However, when they came back to their senses, they were ecstatic.</p><p>“Could it be that Ming ‘er has already become a divine Emperor?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said excitedly.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Such a young martial Supreme was truly too terrifying.</p><p>They finally understood that Qiu Yue would be by Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“This is great, this is great! This time, we can annihilate evil spirit cult and di family!”</p><p>Some people were overjoyed and excited.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on the depths of the DI family..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
