Every day, there would be geniuses dying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest did not have any trouble.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had many geniuses. They were very terrifying when they gathered together. Naturally, no one would have any ideas about them for the time being.</p><p>As time passed, many people began to gather and form groups. They joined forces to fight against the strong enemy.</p><p>Even so, there were still powerful heaven’s favorites who killed their way into a certain group and killed them all.</p><p>The atmosphere in the yuan mountain sacred Academy was extremely depressing.</p><p>Under such circumstances, there were some geniuses who left the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, only a small number of people left. The various cultivation grounds of the yuan mountain sacred Academy were too attractive.</p><p>Furthermore, there were great emperors giving Dao lectures.</p><p>Where could he find such cultivation conditions?</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, although it was dangerous, one’s improvement was the fastest.</p><p>If he left the yuan mountain sacred Academy, his cultivation speed would definitely not be able to keep up with his cultivation in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Everyone was a heaven’s pride expert. Once the gap between them widened, it would be difficult to catch up. The path of cultivation was like going against the current. If you didn’t advance, you would fall behind. Once you fell behind, it was likely that you would never be able to catch up with the other heaven’s pride experts in the future. Even your own achievements would be affected.</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, he might be able to continuously tap on his potential and break through. His future achievements were hard to predict. But after leaving, that might not be the case.</p><p>Therefore, only a small number of people left. Most of them stayed.</p><p>Huang Kong was a genius of the Phoenix Palace. He had once fought with Feng Ling for the heart of the Wutong tree, but they had made up.</p><p>On this day, he met up with the Phoenix Palace. A few geniuses of the divine elephant sect came to the divine power purgatory Valley and planned to cultivate their divine powers there. However, they were stopped outside the valley.</p><p>stop! The divine purgatory Valley has been fully occupied by the sky saber Alliance. No one else is allowed to enter!</p><p>Outside the sacred art purgatory Valley, a few young men stopped Huang Kong and the rest.</p><p>“Sky blade Alliance? You’ve reserved it?”</p><p>Huang Kong and the others were stunned.</p><p>“That’s right. Now, get lost!”</p><p>One of the young men on the other side berated him arrogantly.</p><p>“How dare you? the purgatory Valley was created by the great emperor of the sacred Academy. Anyone who enters the sacred Academy can go in and cultivate. What right do you have to occupy it and not allow others to enter?” An elite of the divine elephant sect was furious.</p><p>“That’s right, you should be the ones to get lost!”</p><p>A disciple of Phoenix Palace berated.</p><p>“Since they don’t want to get lost, then behead them!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the purgatory Valley. A young man in a long golden robe with a cold face stepped out with a few other young men.</p><p>The faces of Huang Kong and the others turned ugly.</p><p>“If you want to fight, we’re not afraid. Let’s go!”</p><p>Said Huang Kong. He wanted to retreat and report this to Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>did 1 say you could leave? do it! Kill them all!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man was overbearing. A Golden Saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at Huang Kong and the others.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was very strong, at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>As for Huang Kong and the others, he had the highest cultivation. He was only a Supreme Saint.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>kill them! Huang Kong shouted. He had not expected the other party to be so overbearing. He had attacked them directly to kill them.</p><p>However, the other party had more people. Their figures flashed and they surrounded them.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s saber fell and a disciple of Phoenix Palace was killed.</p><p>Huang Kong’s eyes turned red and he shouted,” you’ve killed a disciple of Phoenix Palace. Lu Ming and the others will never let you off!</p><p>“What? A disciple of the Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth and the others were shocked.</p><p>He had not expected the other party to be a disciple of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace represented Lu Ming and the group of experts on his side.</p><p>At the thought of Lu Ming and the rest’s combat strength, the Golden-robed young man broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>But now that he had already killed one of the other party’s people, it was already impossible to ease the tension.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all, don’t let a single one escape!”</p><p>The gold-robed youth roared.</p><p>Since they couldn’t ease the tension, they would kill them all. This way, no one would know that they were the ones behind it.</p><p>The terrifying attacks continued to attack Huang Kong and the others. Huang Kong and the others were few in number and their cultivation was weaker than Fang’s. They could not resist at all and were killed one by one.</p><p>Soon, only Huang Kong was left.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s blade-light continued to slash at Huang Kong. Soon, a long wound appeared on Huang Kong’s body, and his body was almost cut in half.</p><p>If not for the fact that he had the Phoenix battle body, the Phoenix’s ability to rise from the ashes, and his strong life force, he would not have been able to fight anymore.</p><p>A Phoenix’s cry was heard. A pair of phoenix wings appeared on Huang Kong’s back. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and the blood landed on the Phoenix wings, causing the flames on the wings to burn and emit a bright light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Huang Kong rushed out of the encirclement despite his serious injuries and flew toward the place where Lu Ming and the others were gathered.</p><p>“Not good, chase!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man and the others ‘expressions changed drastically. They chased after Huang Kong, but he had used a secret skill that would put his life on the line. His speed was astonishing, and he disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The gold-robed youth’s face was ashen.</p><p>If Lu Ming and the rest knew that Huang Kong had escaped, what would they do?</p><p>His eyes flashed with fear as he said,” “Quickly report to the Alliance master that Lu Ming and the others are here to fight for the divine power, purgatory Valley!”</p><p>On the mountain where Lu Ming and the others lived, Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and the others were discussing some matters when someone suddenly rushed in to report.</p><p>“Not good, one of our people has been killed!”</p><p>The person who made the report was a genius of the Phoenix Palace. His face was filled with anger.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the others ‘expressions changed. In a flash, they appeared outside the courtyard. They saw Huang Kong sitting cross-legged on the ground, covered in Phoenix Flames and blood.</p><p>Huang Ling’s face darkened. With a wave of her hand, the undying flame enveloped Huang Kong. With the help of the undying flame, Huang Kong’s injuries recovered quickly. After a while, he was fully recovered.</p><p>“Huang Kong, what’s going on?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>“Our people have been killed …”</p><p>Huang Kong immediately told him what had happened.</p><p>“Sky blade Alliance, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s body exploded with cold killing intent.</p><p>it seems that some people have already begun to fight for a cultivation place. Gather our people and let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, Luo Tianyi, Long Chen, desolate li, and the rest made their way towards the sacred art, purgatory Valley.</p><p>He had killed their people, so he must take revenge.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the divine purgatory Valley, there were already hundreds of people gathered outside.</p><p>it’s them! They killed our people without any explanation!</p><p>Huang Kong pointed at the Golden-robed young man in the crowd.</p><p>“Come out and die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he looked at the Golden-robed young man. He shouted, causing the Golden-robed young man’s face to turn pale..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
