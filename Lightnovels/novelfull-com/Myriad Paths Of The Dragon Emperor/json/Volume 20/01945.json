A large number of soldiers were killed by the Dragon Claw, and blood Qi filled the air. “Run!”</p><p>The battle formation was broken, and it was even more impossible to resist the divine Dragon Army. People were constantly killed, and the remaining people were scared out of their wits and fled frantically.</p><p>“Damnit, kill!”</p><p>A loud roar came from Luoshui Kingdom. An armored general rushed out, giving off a shocking aura.</p><p>This person was an eminent Saint stage powerhouse.</p><p>Luoshui country was much stronger than mingyan country. They had many Supreme Saints, unlike mingyan country, which only had the Imperial advisor. “I’ll play with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and waved his hand. A huge palm was formed and pressed down on the other party.</p><p>“All, not good!”</p><p>The other party was so frightened that his soul flew away. He wanted to escape, but he was directly hit by a palm, and his body was torn into pieces. Within the Army, ruan tianjiao was secretly shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply unfathomable. He could kill a great saint with a lift of his hand. What level was Lu Ming at?</p><p>Great sage perfection? Or an absolute Saint?</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was extremely curious, but then he shook his head. How could such a young absolute Saint be possible?</p><p>She estimated that Lu Ming’s cultivation base was at the peak of the great saint realm or the great saint perfection realm. This was already very shocking.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle. The Army of the Luoshui Kingdom was defeated like a landslide. Almost all of the soldiers were wiped out. The remaining people either surrendered or fled. The few huge warships also belonged to the mingyan Kingdom.</p><p>The divine Dragon Army had defeated the Luoshui Kingdom. When the news spread, the entire country celebrated. Ruan tianjiao’s reputation had also reached its peak.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, ruan tianjiao ascended the throne and became the only Empress of Ming Yan country in so many years.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming cultivated in peace. Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>At this moment, the day of the nine nations Alliance had finally arrived.</p><p>The vast sea was the name of this sea. There were nine countries in total, called the nine countries of the vast sea. The country of mingyan and the country of Luoshui were both part of the nine countries of the vast sea.</p><p>The purpose of this meeting was to select the people who would go to divine light Island.</p><p>It was said that if one headed to the divine time Island, there was a high chance that one would be accepted as a disciple by the experts there. That would be a meteoric rise.</p><p>The divine time Island was the most powerful force in the ten thousand sea realm. It was a Holy Land of martial arts in everyone’s heart.</p><p>And the location of this meeting was in the capital of blue water Country, one of the nine countries.</p><p>The blue water Country was the strongest country among the nine countries and had always been the alliance leader of the nine Country Alliance.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao selected a group of strong people and headed to blue water Country with Lu Ming.</p><p>After a dozen days, they arrived at the capital of blue water Country.</p><p>A few days later, the nine nations Alliance was convened.</p><p>In the square in front of the blue water Kingdom’s Imperial Palace, rows of tables and chairs were arranged. The Kings of the nine nations of the vast sea, as well as some experts, were all seated.</p><p>Blue water country’s people sat at the head of the table, representing their status as the alliance leader.</p><p>alright, this time’s Alliance meeting will be the same as before. It’s to select the candidates to enter the divine time Island. Our nine nations will only have a total of 100 slots!</p><p>A deep voice came from the blue water Country.</p><p>It was the king of blue water Country. He looked to be in his fifties. He was burly and full of Majesty.</p><p>in my opinion, there should only be eight countries this time. The mingyan country does not have the right to participate in this alliance meeting at all. They also do not have the right to go to the divine time Island!</p><p>A cold voice came from the right.</p><p>The one who spoke was a thin middle-aged man, the king of Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>The carefully planned plan of the Luoshui Kingdom for many years had been destroyed. Several Supreme Saints had died in a row, and their strength had weakened a lot. At this time, how could they not target the mingyan Kingdom? “My mingyan country does not have the right to make an Alliance? Do you think you have the final say?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao coldly spoke.</p><p>that goes without saying. You, ruan tianjiao, have the ambition of a Wolf. You killed the king of Ming Yan and replaced him. How can such a person be qualified to participate in the Alliance meeting? ”</p><p>The king of Luoshui opened his mouth coldly and continued to sneer,” the nine nations of the vast sea have a long history. The royal family of each nation has a noble bloodline. Who are you, ruan tianjiao? what right do you have to rule the mingyan country?”</p><p>hehe, your Luoshui country colluded with the state preceptor of my mingyan country and wanted to harm the former king, making the mingyan country miserable. Later, you wanted to harm me. How can 1 not resist?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao sneered.</p><p>rebellion is rebellion. No matter how much you say, you can’t escape the fact of rebellion!</p><p>Luo water King shouted coldly. Then, he looked at blue water King and said,” “Brother Cang, does ruan tianjiao from mingyan country have the right to participate in the Alliance meeting? Do 1 have the qualifications to head to the divine time Island?”</p><p>The king of blue water Country remained calm and said,” the divine time Island is a sacred place. Traitors truly do not have the right to go there. Everyone from the mingyan country, please return!</p><p>The blue water Country ruler’s words clearly showed that he was on the side of the Luoshui Kingdom. This made ruan tianjiao’s face turn ugly.</p><p>As for the people from the other countries, they were all gloating.</p><p>With the departure of Ming Yan country, they would have one less competitor, so they were naturally happy to see that.</p><p>“Hehe, what a joke!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled faintly and his disdainful voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? when did it become your turn to interrupt when the country rulers are talking?”</p><p>The king of Luoshui cast a glance at Lu Ming and chided him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even bother to look at the Luoshui Kingdom monarch. He treated him as air.</p><p>“What’s so funny?”</p><p>The king of vast Water Country looked at Lu Ming and asked coldly.</p><p>“Speaking of rebellion, which of the founding fathers of the nine nations are not traitors? If they had not rebelled, how could the nine nations exist today?” Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, there were no nine nations in the canghai ocean. There was only one nation, and that was the canghai nation.</p><p>At that time, the vast sea kingdom ruled the current territory of the nine nations. Later on, the ancestors of the nine nations betrayed the vast sea kingdom and destroyed it, leading to the current vast sea nine nations.</p><p>It could be said that the ancestors of the nine nations were all traitors.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Impudent, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Those who insult our ancestors will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>One by one, the country rulers roared and their powerful auras enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are all traitors, what right do you have to speak of the fire Country? If the Ming Yan country is not qualified, then all of you are not qualified.”</p><p>Lu Ming was still calm and his voice was filled with contempt.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>From the cangshui Kingdom side, an old man flew out, his cold killing intent undisguisable. A terrifying sword light bloomed from his hand, heading towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This person had the cultivation of a great circle bright Saint.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly. The other party’s sword gleam collapsed. His body trembled violently and he flew back at a speed faster than when he came. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>The eyes of the Kings of the various countries and the other experts all narrowed, revealing a trace of seriousness.</p><p>A loud shout had injured a great circle bright Saint.. Could it be that this person had the cultivation of a great saint at such a young age?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
