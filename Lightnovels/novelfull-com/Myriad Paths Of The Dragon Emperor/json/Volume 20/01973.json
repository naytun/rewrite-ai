Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed one of Luo cangqiong’s legs and used him as a weapon. He kept throwing him out. Several Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect were smashed away. One of them was even smashed to death. The others vomited blood and flew back.</p><p>hahaha, awesome! This weapon is really suitable for me!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily, feeling extremely carefree.</p><p>On the other hand, Luo cangqiong was furious. He kept roaring and wanted to rush out and fight with Lu Ming, but he finally held back.</p><p>He was too aggrieved. At first, Lu Ming stepped on his face until his face was stuck in the rock. Then, Lu Ming stepped on his crotch, causing him so much pain that he wished he was dead.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was using him as a weapon to kill the people of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>He was mad with hatred and kept roaring to vent his anger.</p><p>He knew that he had lost too much face. No matter how great his achievements were in the future, even if he were to break through to the great sovereign realm like his grandfather, this matter would still become a shame for the rest of his life. He would be laughed at behind his back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll make you wish you were dead. I swear. Ah, your family, your friends, they’re all going to die …”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s voice sounded like a madman.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? It was you who killed the people of your Daluo heaven sect. I’m just ‘doing it’ for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Luo cangqiong spurted out a mouthful of blood. What did he mean by he was the one who killed the Daluo heaven sect? what did he mean by Lu Ming was just ‘doing it for him’? Don’t use me as a weapon if you have the ability.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved Luo cangqiong and sent another Emperor-to-be flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>As for Luo cangqiong himself, he was also dizzy from the impact.</p><p>“Don’t fight him head on!”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect shouted and retreated, not daring to approach Lu Ming.</p><p>The other emperors-to-be did the same. When they saw Lu Ming, they ran away in a hurry.</p><p>As a result, a funny scene formed at the scene.</p><p>Lu Ming was chasing Luo cangqiong in the sky, while the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect was running around in panic.</p><p>Many people were speechless.</p><p>The young master of the Daluo heaven sect, the grandson of the great emperor, the sovereign who had deprived his King body, and nearly 100 Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect had been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>After Luo cangqiong had been abused, he had become Lu Ming’s weapon. It was really speechless.</p><p>At the same time, everyone was shocked. This also proved Lu Ming’s power.</p><p>hey, don’t run! There are so many emperors-to-be here, but you don’t dare to fight me. The Daluo heaven sect is a great emperor-level force. How disappointing!</p><p>Lu Ming held Luo cangqiong upside down and ran wildly in the air, chasing after the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>The faces of the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect turned green with anger.</p><p>If you have the ability, then put Luo cangqiong down. You’re carrying Luo cangqiong, and you’re still fighting like this?</p><p>The emperors-to-be roared in their hearts.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you have the ability, come and fight me!”</p><p>At this moment, the sound of the stellar River reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>He was also very unhappy. In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, Luo cangqiong had sided with him and was a member of the heaven Emperor Alliance. Now that he was so badly beaten by Lu Ming, he had lost all face.</p><p>At this moment, the star River and the death blade had already exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>The death blade was gradually losing the upper hand.</p><p>After all, the eternal Star River had long broken through to the perfected absolute Saint realm and was very close to the Emperor-to-be realm. In terms of mastery of its nomological laws, it was stronger than the death blade slash. After a long battle, it gradually gained the advantage.</p><p>“Heng Xinghe, your cultivation base is two levels higher than mine, and you’re an eternal Son, yet you’re challenging someone with a lower cultivation base than you. But isn’t the Heng family all like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“If you don’t dare to fight, then just say it?” The star River and the death blade exchanged another blow, forcing the death blade to retreat dozens of miles.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, you don’t have to try to goad me. But today, I’m really going to fight you!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stopped chasing the people of the Daluo heaven sect. He carried Luo cangqiong and walked toward the star River.</p><p>Many people were shocked, including Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others who were Lu Ming’s enemies.</p><p>Was Lu Ming really going to fight against the Galaxy?</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was definitely not a match for the Galaxy.</p><p>Perhaps he was going to join forces with the death blade!</p><p>Many people thought so!</p><p>“Let me go!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and stepped on Luo cangqiong’s crotch. Luo cangqiong shrieked like a eunuch and arched his body.</p><p>Runes kept flowing out of Lu Ming’s palm and covered Luo cangqiong’s armor, sealing him. He could not resist and could only be carried by Lu Ming like a weapon.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Was Lu Ming going to use Luo cangqiong as a weapon to fight against the Galaxy?</p><p>“Death blade, leave the Galaxy to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and came to the death blade.</p><p>“Leave it to you?”</p><p>The death blade’s eyes were filled with doubt.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t believe me? Don’t worry, I’ll help you beat this Galaxy up, you can go help Huang Ling and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>this Lu Ming is so arrogant. He actually wants to fight alone in the Galaxy!</p><p>also, didn’t you hear his tone? he actually ordered the death blade to help Huang Ling and the others. What a joke. With the death blade’s personality, it’s good that he didn’t draw his sword against him!</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>Although many people were still in the midst of a chaotic battle, there was a group of people who had yet to make a move. They stood in the distance and watched the battle. After hearing Lu Ming’s words, they all shook their heads.</p><p>However, what happened next was beyond their expectations.</p><p>The death blade nodded and turned into a terrifying blade light, killing the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family.</p><p>The blade of death was extremely terrifying. With one slash, three Emperor-to-be from the Heng family were killed.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s kill him together!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Heng family was furious. He joined forces and launched a terrible attack on the death blade. However, the death blade was surrounded by the light of death, and the area within 100 meters of him was like a land of death, like a god of death.</p><p>The light of death merged with the saber Light and broke the opponent’s attack, killing an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>An ordinary Emperor-to-be would be killed by the death blade in one move.</p><p>“Death canopy!”</p><p>Then, a terrifying gray gas emanated from the death blade’s body. This was the Qi of death, and it covered at least half of the DA yan elixir furnace.</p><p>The emperors-to-be retreated when they saw the Qi of death.</p><p>In this way, the pressure on Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Ouyang Wushuang was greatly reduced. They could already block the other party’s attack.</p><p>Xinghe’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>His body was shrouded in eternal light, like a god, eternal and immortal.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the Galaxy took a step forward and a terrifying aura pressed down on Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>He did not want to waste any more time. He wanted to end the battle quickly and kill Lu Ming as soon as possible to get back the celestial Emperor’s sword. “Let’s fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His spine was suffused with a blood-red light. A drop of blood appeared, and a powerful and terrifying force gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The third bloodline!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
