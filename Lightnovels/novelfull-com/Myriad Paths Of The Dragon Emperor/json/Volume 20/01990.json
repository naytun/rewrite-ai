At least they can take care of each other!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads. Following that, Luo Tianyi and Huang Li led the other elites of the desolate race and charged into the distance.</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Ling, and Luo Xiang formed a group and ran into the distance.</p><p>bubble, you’ll support from the middle. If any side encounters any danger that they can’t handle, rescue them in time!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Pao Pao.</p><p>“Alright, brother Lu Ming, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles nodded, and her petite figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, led Lu Xiangxiang in a direction.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Not long after, an Emperor-to-be three-eyed God was punched to death by Lu Ming. He kept the God’s third eye and a black bangle.</p><p>This bracelet was used by the three-eyed God race to store items, and its function was similar to storage rings.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, I’ll leave these two to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left the two lower-tier absolute Saints to Xiangxiang Bella. He would deal with the rest.</p><p>The battlefield was the best place to temper himself. He was thinking that when Ouyang Moll’s cultivation was higher, he would also bring him out to temper himself.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella fought two three-eyed God race absolute Saints at the lower-tier absolute Saint realm alone, and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>Not long after, Xiangxiang Bella successfully killed the two three-eyed God race members.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he gave Xiangxiang Beila a three-eyed God who was a late-stage absolute Saint.</p><p>The three-eyed God instantly gave Xiangxiang Xiang a fatal pressure.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella’s shoulder was hit by the other party’s destructive light, and a hole appeared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of helping.</p><p>He had experienced too many life-and-death battles in his life. He knew very well that if he didn’t experience any life-and-death battles, he would just be a flower in a greenhouse. It was useless no matter how strong his talent was.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila called out delicately, her small face pale.</p><p>solve it yourself. As the child of life, do you have to always rely on others?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a cold expression. He killed an absolute Saint in the great circle with one punch.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila gritted her teeth. Her entire body was covered in green light as she circulated her life laws. Her injuries from before were instantly healed.</p><p>The body of life and the law of life contained endless vitality. It was many times stronger than Huang Ling’s law of imperishable flame and had vigorous vitality.</p><p>At the same time, countless vines appeared, like long whips, sweeping towards the other party.</p><p>But without a doubt, Xiangxiang Beila was at a disadvantage.</p><p>She was talented, but she didn’t have much combat experience, so she couldn’t use all her power.</p><p>However, during the battle, Xiangxiang Beila seemed to have found the feeling and was already able to slowly protect herself.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then hunted alone in the surrounding area.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila had been fighting with the other party for a few hundred moves and had been injured many times. Under the life law, she had recovered very quickly.</p><p>“What monster?”</p><p>The more the three-eyed God fought, the more frightened he became.</p><p>The other party was completely unkillable, and his own injuries were getting worse and worse.</p><p>After a few hundred moves, Xiangxiang Beila finally exhausted her opponent to death and then killed her.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila was also heavily injured. However, under the life laws, she was rapidly recovering.</p><p>“Master, I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila came to Lu Ming’s side. Her eyes were much more determined and sharp than before.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad, continue!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said. Then, he gave Xiangxiang Beila another three-eyed God who was an absolute Saint in the late stages.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella’s talent was indeed unparalleled. In a life-and-death battle, she had improved at an astonishing speed. Her display of combat power, her use of the power law, her battle consciousness, and her battle mentality had all undergone a huge change.</p><p>This time, within a hundred moves, Xiangxiang Beila finished off her opponent. Although she was also severely injured, with her Constitution, she was not afraid of being injured.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and brought Xiangxiang Beila to continue hunting the three-eyed God race.</p><p>As for Huang Ling, Long Chen, and desolate li, they were all going through a tough battle.</p><p>Their opponents were naturally Emperor-to-be level.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Huang Li were all at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. They had the power to fight an Emperor-to-be, but it would be difficult.</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s cultivation level was higher, so she was still in a better position, but she was also in a tough battle.</p><p>Everyone was engaged in a life-or-death battle in order to break through their limits and achieve a great leap.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a destructive light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The destructive light cut through the void silently, but Lu Ming’s hair stood on end as he felt a fatal threat.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming pointed in that direction. The power of the chaotic finger of tribulation gathered in his finger and collided with the destructive light.</p><p>boom!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a surge of terrifying power surging towards him. He could not help but take a few steps back and his fingers were numb.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and looked ahead.</p><p>&Nbsp; a five-meter tall three-eyed God riding a strange beast was approaching, his body exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>This three-eyed God wasn’t a great emperor, but he was definitely powerful.</p><p>“Kid, I’ve been watching you for a few days. You’ve killed many of our men. Today is the day you die. Kill!”</p><p>The burly three-eyed God roared and swung his battle axe. The mutant beast roared and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The strange beast roared and spat out a jet-black ray of light from its mouth. It charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the three-eyed God’s battle-ax tore through the air and slashed down at Lu Ming. The massive ax seemed to be able to split the sky apart, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>Holy weapons floated around Lu Ming.</p><p>There were only 37 of them.</p><p>Back in the world of the lotus flower, during the battle with the Emperor-to-be, most of the Saint weapons he had sealed in his meridians had been destroyed. Only a dozen or so absolute Saint weapons were left.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had re-cultivated the ten thousand soldiers art.</p><p>This time, he didn’t seal the bright Saint weapons or great saint weapons, but all of them into Saint weapons.</p><p>There were a total of 36 of them, and the last one was a monarch weapon.</p><p>It was the monarch weapon he got from Luo pokong.</p><p>Although there were fewer of them than before, their power was many times stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and the other 36 absolute Saint weapons floated around him. The Qi of the combat weapon was integrated and blocked the attack of the beast.</p><p>At the same time, he lifted his spear and clashed with the battle-ax.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>&Nbsp; a terrifying shockwave exploded out, and the other party roared as he and the Beast he was riding were forced back a dozen steps.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, his body also retreated.</p><p>what a powerful combat strength! It’s equivalent to the king body of the Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind and his eyes flashed with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>His combat strength was equivalent to the Emperor-to-be King body. This was the strongest Emperor-to-be Lu Ming had ever encountered. Previously, the Emperor-to-be he had encountered could not put pressure on him.</p><p>However, this one was different. It had the ability to threaten Lu Ming’s life.</p><p>This was also the training that Lu Ming wanted. Otherwise, Lu Ming would not be able to train in the big battle..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
