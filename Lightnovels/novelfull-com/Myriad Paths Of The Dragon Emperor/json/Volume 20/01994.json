He would probably have killed him with a slap.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and launched an attack, his figure suddenly pouncing towards Feng wuchen.</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was still the same Lu Ming, the Lu Ming who stirred up a storm in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>He was still so bold as to kill Feng wuchen, the wind race’s King body, in front of the wind race’s martial sovereign.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The wind race’s martial sovereign shouted and pressed down with one hand. A powerful aura was exerted on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>In an instant, the air in the surroundings seemed to have frozen. Lu Ming felt as if hundreds of mountains were pressing down on him. His body came to a halt.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles had been sitting on Lu Ming’s shoulder. At this moment, her small face was flushed red. The light of space-time spread out and her small hand was like a knife, slashing forward.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>The space fluctuated violently as if it was about to split open. A crack appeared on the force that the other party used on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The light of chaos burst out and he pointed with all his might.</p><p>&Nbsp; Primal Chaos energy surged, and the power of the primal Chaos tribulation finger exploded into a single point, combining with the power of the bubble.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space was boiling, and a crack was torn open by the power of the martial sovereign.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Wind Clan’s martial sovereign’s expression changed.</p><p>However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s figure disappeared from where he was standing. He broke through the Martial Emperor’s power and suddenly appeared in front of Feng wuchen. He grabbed at Feng wuchen with his big hand.</p><p>Feng wuchen initially thought that with a Martial Emperor present, he would be safe. He did not expect Lu Ming to break through the barrier of a Martial Emperor’s power and suddenly appear in front of him.</p><p>He wanted to retreat, but it was too late.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed his neck with his large hand. A violent force surged in and sealed his cultivation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed Feng wuchen and smashed him onto the ground.</p><p>The ground rumbled. The ground of the Feng clan’s Palace was made of solid black Gold stone, but it was all cracked. Feng wuchen was embedded into the black gold stone.</p><p>He spat out mouthfuls of blood, his body twitched, and his eyes turned white like dead fish.</p><p>The people from the other forces were all dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>First, she was shocked that Lu Ming could break through the barrier of a martial Supreme’s power.</p><p>Under the suppression of a Martial Emperor’s power, an ordinary Martial Emperor would find it difficult to move at all.</p><p>Secondly, she was shocked that Lu Ming really did what he said. He seriously injured Feng wuchen in front of the Wind Clan’s Martial Emperor in the Wind Clan’s Palace. It looked like he really wanted to kill Feng wuchen.</p><p>A fiend! A true fiend!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and the others watched with their blood boiling.</p><p>“I advise you to let Feng wuchen go!”</p><p>The wind race’s martial sovereign’s face was extremely gloomy, and a terrifying killing intent was brewing.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually managed to take down Feng wuchen despite being blocked by his power. This made him lose all face.</p><p>Moreover, Feng wuchen couldn’t die. He had the unparalleled King body, and his future was unpredictable. He had the potential to become a great emperor.</p><p>Although the wind race was an ancient race with deep foundations and astonishing strength, they didn’t have a great emperor.</p><p>A great emperor was too important to a force.</p><p>“Let him go and let him continue to take revenge on me? 1 won’t give him a second chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He stepped on Feng wuchen’s face, causing his body to Twitch again.</p><p>“If you kill him, your friends will die too!”</p><p>A few more voices came from the Wind Clan’s Palace, each of them exuding an extremely shocking aura.</p><p>Martial Emperor, they were all martial emperors!</p><p>One of them had a vast aura and was surrounded by the divine light of the world. He was a true Emperor.</p><p>It seemed like the wind race was no longer calm. Martial Emperor powerhouses appeared one after another.</p><p>The one who had just spoken was the true Emperor, and he looked sharply at Lu Xiangxiang and the others.</p><p>the true Emperor is actually threatening me with a few juniors. What a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>let Feng wuchen go now. Otherwise, none of you will be able to escape. I know that you have an old saying behind you, but you can scare others, but you can’t scare the wind race!</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor said coldly. A powerful aura enveloped Lu Xiangxiang and the others. With a single thought, Lu Xiangxiang and the others would die.</p><p>“Master, don’t worry about us. Kill that guy!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang called out.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor shouted coldly. He raised his hand and pressed down, causing a huge hand to grab Xiangxiang Bella.</p><p>Right at this moment, the space in front of Xiangxiang Beila suddenly split open, and a walking stick flew out. With a single sweep, it destroyed the wind race true Emperor’s giant hand.</p><p>Then, the walking stick expanded rapidly, turning into an ancient tree that reached the sky. It then smashed down toward the wind true Emperor.</p><p>“Uncle Kong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He naturally recognized that this walking stick belonged to uncle Kong.</p><p>“It’s Grandpa Kong!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang cried out.</p><p>The true Emperor of the wind race’s expression changed drastically as he felt a terrifying pressure from the staff.</p><p>He let out a long roar, and the time of the world burst out, blasting out the power of the world. Endless gales whistled and swept towards the crutch.</p><p>However, the wind dispersed as the walking stick pressed down. The huge walking stick landed on the wind race’s true Thearch’s body and sent him flying for a hundred miles. His face was pale as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. A true Emperor was injured in one move. This was truly terrifying.</p><p>“It’s the one from the great Yan elixir Palace!”</p><p>his strength is truly unfathomable and difficult to estimate!</p><p>The experts from the other forces of ancient Moon Holy Land discussed in shock.</p><p>In the Skywolf tower, the WAN family’s people had very ugly expressions.</p><p>This was because two of their true Emperor experts had been killed by uncle Kong.</p><p>a few years ago, I said that the elders should not interfere in the matters of the younger generation, especially now that they are just a group of sage realm experts. If your void Emperor and even the true Emperor want to attack, don’t blame me for bullying the young!</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice resounded from the walking stick.</p><p>“Senior, it’s better to squash enmity than keep it alive. Feng wuchen has also suffered. Let Lu Ming let him go and we’ll let this matter go. The Wind Clan won’t ask about it anymore. What do you think?”</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“I don’t care about the matters of the younger generation. Let them decide for themselves whether to kill or not. It’s best if you great emperors don’t get involved!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Senior, so you’re going to interfere? it won’t do you any good to start a war with my Wind Clan!”</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“I’d like to see how you’re going to make it so that I won’t get any benefits!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice sounded.</p><p>The wind race’s martial sovereigns all had unsightly expressions. It was obvious that uncle Kong was going to interfere.</p><p>“Quickly send a message to the chief!”</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor sent a voice transmission to a void Emperor of the wind race.</p><p>The void Emperor nodded and secretly sent out the news.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just do what you want. There’s no need to worry!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice rang out from within the cane.</p><p>His words made the experts of the wind race change their expressions.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The members of the wind race roared.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Feng wuchen started to struggle crazily as if he could feel death approaching..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
