They were all shocked. Lu Ming would definitely die if he entered.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s expression was very cold. Lu Ming is very terrifying and unpredictable. Moreover, there’s another person who understands the Law of Time and space going in with him. He might not die!</p><p>These words caused the hearts of the others to tremble.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming was very terrifying to begin with. In addition, he had a person who knew the space-time law. Even if he entered the pitch-black Vortex, he might not be in any trouble.</p><p>In that case, Lu Ming was the one who took the initiative to go in just now.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was ugly, but they had no confidence in going in to pursue. After all, the danger was unpredictable.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, even if he doesn’t die, I’ll kill him sooner or later!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong snorted coldly. They did not leave, but guarded the place in case Lu Ming came out.</p><p>They had guessed correctly. Lu Ming had indeed entered the dark vortex on his own accord.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t dare to fight. He still had a trump card. However, he was worried about Qiu Yue’s safety.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s injuries were too severe. She had to be treated as soon as possible, or she would be in real danger.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered the pitch-black Vortex, a terrifying destructive cutting force surged towards him from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his holy power and controlled the chaos laws at the same time, covering his entire body to resist the attack.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>The cutting force kept hitting Lu Ming’s body, causing the chaos laws to tremble as if they were about to collapse.</p><p>“This cutting power is indeed amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the chaos laws at full force to resist.</p><p>At the same time, there was a void storm in the Black Vortex, pushing Lu Ming aimlessly into the distance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Not long after, there was a flash of light and bubbles appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Bubbles controlled spacetime and had already cultivated the spacetime light. The void storm could not do anything to her.</p><p>Bubbles appeared beside Lu Ming. They set up space-time laws around them, blocking the void storm outside.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, the Dayan elixir furnace flew over and was put away by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking about Qiu Yue. With a thought, Qiu Yue came out of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue was unconscious and her breathing was weak.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s attack was too powerful. He had hidden at the side and used the law of deprivation to deprive the outside world of energy. He had accumulated a terrifying amount of power and had intended to kill Lu Ming in one blow.</p><p>In a hurry, Qiu Yue only wanted to block that move for Lu Ming. She was too seriously injured.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He could not wait to crush Luo cangqiong’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I won’t let anything happen to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and took out a healing pill. He melted the pill with his holy power and fused it into Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue’s injuries were still not getting better.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, try the fruit of the divine Tree of time!”</p><p>The bubble opened its mouth and the divine Tree of time appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The divine Tree of time originally had two milky-white fruits. Bubble had swallowed one and there was still one left.</p><p>Since the divine Tree of time could double A martialist’s longevity, it was actually equivalent to increasing their vitality. This meant that the fruit of the divine Tree of time contained powerful vitality.</p><p>This fruit might be able to save Qiu Yue!</p><p>Lu Ming plucked the fruit and refined it into Qiu Yue’s body with holy power.</p><p>As expected, the fruit of the divine time tree contained boundless vitality that seeped into Qiu Yue’s limbs and bones. The injuries on her body were rapidly recovering, and her aura had also stabilized.</p><p>However, he did not wake up!</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, it seems like sister Qiuyue’s injuries are too severe. Just a fruit of the divine Tree of time is not enough to wake her up!”</p><p>Pao Pao sized up Qiu Yue before saying.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his Saint energy throughout Qiu Yue’s body. After a while, he sighed.</p><p>Even though Qiu Yue’s life force had stabilized, it was just as bubbles had said. It was not easy to wake her up.</p><p>Lu Ming caressed Qiu Yue’s face and wiped the blood off the corner of her mouth. He said softly, Qiuyue, no matter what, I won’t let anything happen to you. I won’t let go of Luo cangqiong and the Daluo heaven sect!</p><p>At the end of his sentence, Lu Ming’s voice turned cold and a cold killing intent burst forth.</p><p>It had been far too dangerous this time. Fortunately, he had the fruit of the divine Tree of time. Otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>If anything happened to Qiu Yue, Lu Ming would never be at ease.</p><p>Qiu Yue was still the same as before. She did not say much and did not have many requests. She only stayed by Lu Ming’s side silently and was willing to give up everything for him, including her life!</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s small hand as he recalled the scenes of their childhood. After a long time, Lu Ming sent Qiu Yue back into the mountain and river diagram and placed her under the path-understanding ancient tree, hoping that it would be of help to her.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a look at his surroundings. They were still in the chaotic void storm.</p><p>The bubble enveloped the surroundings with spacetime laws and broke through the void storm.</p><p>“Bubble, how do we get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>In the aspect of space, nature bubbles were more skilled.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, with my current cultivation, I can’t force my way out of this space. I need to wait. I need to find a weak point in the space and rush out in one fell swoop!”</p><p>Bubbles explained.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>They continued to wait while observing their surroundings, looking for an opportunity.</p><p>As time passed, bubble’s power grew weaker and weaker. If this continued, they would be in danger when bubble’s power was exhausted.</p><p>“I don’t even know where they’re floating to!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. It was very dangerous to drift in the void like this. It would be fine if he drifted to other worlds. However, if he drifted to the void of eternal nothingness, he would die without the cultivation of a martial Supreme. “Brother Lu Ming, I got it. Look over there!”</p><p>Bubbles suddenly pointed to the right.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw that there were some fluctuations in the void, let’s attack with all our might and break out! Chirp chirp!</p><p>Bubbles cried out as he controlled the laws of time to change direction and fly towards the source of the fluctuation.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength and pointed his finger.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s chaos finger of tribulation had reached ninety-four percent completion. The power of a full-force point was astonishing.</p><p>At the same time, the bubbles cooperated with Lu Ming to bombard the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void trembled violently. Then, there was a hiss and a crack appeared. Lu Ming was overjoyed and he rushed over with the bubble.</p><p>As soon as he rushed through the crack, Lu Ming realized that he had appeared in a cave.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A loud roar came from behind Lu Ming. The stench assailed his nostrils, and it was accompanied by a scorching aura.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, there was a burly man who looked at Lu Ming and bubbles with a dumbfounded expression..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
