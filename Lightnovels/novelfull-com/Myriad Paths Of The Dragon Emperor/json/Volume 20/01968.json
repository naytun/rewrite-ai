It was the legendary ninth world, the world where the undying lived.</p><p>At this moment, many figures were gathered at the edge of the heavenly abyss.</p><p>These people were all experts from various forces in the outside world. Most of them were Emperor-to-be.</p><p>There were also some heaven’s favorites with monarch weapons who could also pass through the spatial turbulence.</p><p>On the edge of the heavenly abyss, there was a huge platform that seemed to be built with some kind of huge stone. In the middle of the platform, there was a huge altar. Around the altar, there were dense inscriptions.</p><p>In front of the altar, there was a young figure sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.</p><p>However, everyone seemed to be afraid of this figure, and no one dared to approach the platform.</p><p>Because this person was the stellar River!</p><p>The eternal Son, Heng Xinghe, was too terrifying. Previously, there was an Emperor-to-be who had disrespected him and was killed by him in seconds.</p><p>Even if the other party had many Emperor-to-be experts, they were still far from being a match for the star River.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be could only be killed in seconds in the face of the Galaxy. He couldn’t even withstand one move.</p><p>What was shocking was that his cultivation in the Xing Xing River realm had yet to reach the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Moreover, there were also Emperor-to-be experts from the Heng family.</p><p>Therefore, the stellar River occupied the ancient platform that looked very important, and the others could only watch from the outside.</p><p>Of course, there were also people with killing intent in their eyes, and that was the he family.</p><p>They wished they could kill the Galaxy, but they were no match for the Galaxy here. They could only hide far away, not daring to get close.</p><p>“Young master Xinghe, you’ve been studying it for days. Do you know how to cross this abyss and head to the Ninth World?”</p><p>Finally, someone asked.</p><p>Xinghe didn’t make a sound, as if he was ignoring that person. It was only after a long while that Xinghe opened his mouth and said,” “I already know the method!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“What method is it?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“It’s not the time to say it yet!”</p><p>In the Galaxy.</p><p>“If it’s not time to say it, then when will it be time to say it!”</p><p>The man asked.</p><p>“Are you questioning me?”</p><p>Xing Chen suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were like two divine swords, piercing toward the man.</p><p>The man was shocked as he felt a cold killing intent covering him. He couldn’t help but retreat. His face turned pale and he quickly said,” “1 don’t dare, 1 don’t dare!”</p><p>“I’ll naturally say it when I should!”</p><p>After saying that, the eternal Star River closed its eyes again.</p><p>The person from before heaved a long sigh of relief, but his back was already drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>the eternal Son is too terrifying. He’s not even an Emperor-to-be, but he’s already so terrifying. If he becomes an Emperor-to-be, he’ll be able to compete with martial sovereigns!</p><p>Many people had the same thought and were shocked.</p><p>The people of the he family looked gloomy.</p><p>A chosen like the eternal Son was a disaster for the he clan.</p><p>In the future, if the Heng family’s two great emperors joined forces and the Heng family broke through to the great emperor realm, the he family would definitely be destroyed.</p><p>Therefore, the people of the he family were thinking about how to get rid of the star River.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed.</p><p>On this day, the star River that had been sitting there suddenly opened its eyes and looked into the distance. Its eyes were sharp as it muttered,”It’s finally here!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>They’re finally here. Who’s here?</p><p>Everyone’s gaze followed the direction of the stellar River and saw a group of people walking in the Air.</p><p>They were led by a few young men.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming, the son of chaos, Lu Ming!</p><p>Someone exclaimed in a low voice as he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>This made many people’s hearts tremble. Could it be that the eternal Star River had been waiting here all this while for Lu Ming?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The star River Rose and took a step forward, heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the Heng family’s experts also followed beside the Heng family.</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the rest stopped.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally here. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!”</p><p>Said Xing Chen indifferently.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He knew that he would face the stellar River when he came here.</p><p>Lu Ming, you killed the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family. Today, I’ll use your blood to pay tribute to them!</p><p>Behind the star River, a figure shouted. It was an eternal stone.</p><p>“They wanted to kill me, so why can’t 1 fight back?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course you can. In the world of martial Dao, everything is decided by strength. Those who are strong live, and those who are weak die. They’re not as strong as you, so they deserve to die!</p><p>Xing Chen said indifferently as if he didn’t care about the death of a few Emperor-to-be from the Heng family.</p><p>however, they’re from the Heng family, and so am 1. You killed them, so I’m going to kill you. Lu Ming, hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword and I’ll give you a quick death!</p><p>The Galaxy continued.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, I knew you were here for the sword of Celestial Emperor. Back then, you couldn’t do anything to me in the yuan mountain Saint Academy. Today, you can’t do anything to me either!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his eyes slowly filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“This place isn’t the yuan mountain sacred Academy!”</p><p>Heng Shan said coldly.</p><p>His meaning was clear. Back then at the yuan mountain sacred Academy, Lu Ming had fought alongside many experts in the Heng Xing River. However, today, there were experts from the Heng family here. They would not let Lu Ming and the others have this chance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Heng family had been around for countless years and was an Emperor-level power with too many experts.</p><p>There were more than a hundred Emperor-to-be here today. When they gathered together, their momentum was terrifying.</p><p>A terrifying aura pressed down on Lu Ming and the rest, causing their expressions to change.</p><p>“We’re here to help you!”</p><p>Not far away, a voice could be heard. A group of people came behind Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>They were the Emperor-to-be of Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, Thunder God sect, and other forces.</p><p>“We are your opponents!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. A giant wolf stepped in the air, a golden Crow let out a long cry, and the Qi of a combat weapon soared into the sky.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Golden Crow clan, the Sirius tower, the WAN family, the purple Extreme sect, and other forces stepped on the air and pressed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>A beautiful woman came to Lu Ming’s side with a group of experts. It was Luo Tianyi and the Emperor-to-be of the Jade pool immortal Palace.</p><p>Following that, many scattered experts joined Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>For example, the Emperor-to-be of the shenyuan Empire and other sects.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming and the rest were far from capable.</p><p>Most of the forces on Lu Ming’s side were from the ancient Moon Holy Land. At most, they could only compete with the Golden Crow clan and the Sirius tower, which were also forces from the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Even with the addition of the shenyuan Empire, it would be useless.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s really lively. Lu Ming, 1 have to say that you’re really lucky!”</p><p>With a sneer, Luo cangqiong led the powerhouses of the Daluo heaven sect to the side of the Heng family’s powerhouse.</p><p>Then, the Masters of the wind race also came to the side of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, many people’s expressions changed. The other party was too powerful. The difference in strength between the two sides was too great..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
