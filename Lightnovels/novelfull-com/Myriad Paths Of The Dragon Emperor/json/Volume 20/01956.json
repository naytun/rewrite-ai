There are three altars in the entire time mountain. As long as one of them is broken, the power of time in the mountain will be greatly reduced. If all three altars are broken, the mountain will be free to move!</p><p>The sagemaster said, his eyes revealing a trace of fiery anticipation.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The group continued to move forward. In the end, including Lu Ming and bubbles, there were more than ten people who came to the front of the altar. The rest could not withstand the attacks and retreated.</p><p>“I’ll blast him to pieces!”</p><p>A brawny man held a giant axe and swung it at the altar.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant axe landed on the altar, causing it to shake violently. However, a terrifying time power also rushed out and hit the burly man. The burly man’s body instantly shriveled up, and some white hair appeared on his black head.</p><p>“Dammit, my longevity!”</p><p>The burly man bellowed. In that instant, he felt as if he had been deprived of tens of thousands of years of life. This made him furious.</p><p>“This altar has such powerful time power. How do we break it?”</p><p>Some people glared at the sagemaster.</p><p>if you want it, you have to pay a price. As long as you bombard it a little longer, you can break the altar!</p><p>The sagemaster spoke.</p><p>The rest of the people fell silent.</p><p>if I retreat, my lifespan will be taken away. Even if I obtain a treasure that can increase my lifespan, it’s useless. The gains do not make up for the losses!</p><p>Some people shook their heads and retreated.</p><p>The rest of the people also shook their heads.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. Under the control of bubbles ‘space-time law, he punched the altar.</p><p>The altar rumbled and shook violently. A strong power of time rushed toward Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming’s chaos law and the space-time law of the bubbles successfully blocked the power of time.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>The eyes of the sagemaster and the others all lit up.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s fists continued to bombard the altar with terrifying fist forces.</p><p>The altar kept shaking, and a strong power of time rushed out. An ordinary Emperor-to-be wouldn’t be able to resist it and would be turned into bones.</p><p>However, they were blocked by Lu Ming and bubbles.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>When Lu Ming threw dozens of punches, the altar let out a cracking sound.</p><p>The sagemaster’s eyes bloomed with brilliant light.</p><p>After a few more punches, the entire altar exploded with a boom, sending debris flying everywhere.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the time energy of the entire mountain of time was rapidly weakening.</p><p>“The power of time has weakened!”</p><p>“Those plants are mine!”</p><p>Many people couldn’t hold back anymore and rushed toward the time God mountain and the plants.</p><p>&Nbsp; the power of time in the time God mountain had weakened, so many people were able to rush out far away.</p><p>Lu Ming and Paopao moved and rushed to the top of the canyon.</p><p>The others did the same and rushed to the top of the canyon one by one.</p><p>“Lu Ming, destroy the other two altars in the other two directions!”</p><p>The sagemaster’s eyes glowed with a dazzling light as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“We’ll talk later!”</p><p>Lu Ming left these words and dashed towards the peak of the divine mountain.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The sagemaster bellowed in his heart. He then continued to shout,”Lu Ming, the other two altars are still intact. You won’t be able to reach the peak. Go and destroy the other two altars first!” He ordered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with the sagemaster.</p><p>He had a faint feeling that the sagemaster had an unspeakable motive for asking them to destroy the sacrificial altar.</p><p>It was very likely that it would be disadvantageous to them.</p><p>It was enough to destroy one. Lu Ming would not be so foolish to destroy the other two.</p><p>“Damn it, you guys go and destroy the other two!”</p><p>The sagemaster ordered the experts of the divine time Island.</p><p>Those people’s expressions changed, but they had to listen to the sagemaster’s orders. They all rushed to the other two altars.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was approaching the top of the mountain. He picked the plants he encountered along the way.</p><p>oh no, Lu Ming is reaching the top of the mountain. That Divine Tree of time is mine!</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the Emperor-to-be experts also rushed to the top of the mountain.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, even though the time energy of the time God mountain had been greatly weakened, it was still very strong near the peak.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be’s speed became slower and slower. They could not keep up with Lu Ming’s speed at all. In the end, they could not even move an inch because the power of time had exceeded the limit of their resistance.</p><p>we’ll stop him from below. Even if he has the divine Tree of time, he’ll have to come down!</p><p>“That’s right, we’ll wait for him down there!”</p><p>Several voices rang out in succession. It was the wind race’s quasi-Emperor, the Golden Crow race’s zhundu, and the others.</p><p>They also stopped near the top of the mountain. They had already reached their limits.</p><p>“These people should be killed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept across the wind race’s Emperor-to-be and the rest. Then, he sent a voice transmission to Paopao.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly stopped. He turned around abruptly and pounced toward the wind race’s Emperor-to-be and the others.</p><p>His body was shrouded in the power of space time, and his speed was extremely shocking. Moreover, he was moving from top to bottom, so he was even faster.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s figure appeared next to the wind race’s Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Time acceleration!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out as a spacetime law enveloped the wind race quasi-Emperor.</p><p>There was already a terrifying power of time in this place. Coupled with the bubble’s time acceleration, the wind race’s quasi-Emperor felt as if his life was being taken away and his essence Qi was rapidly flowing away.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he charged at the wind race’s Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to kill me? the Wind Clan is an ancient clan…”</p><p>The wind race’s Emperor-to-be roared, but the next moment, the combat sword slashed down and the man’s body was split into two.</p><p>This person was truly laughable. Previously, he had targeted Lu Ming and wanted to kill him. Now, in the face of Lu Ming’s counterattack, he even brought up the wind race to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the Emperor-to-be of the wind race, he did not stop and charged at another giant wolf from the Sirius tower.</p><p>It was exactly the same as the wind race’s Emperor-to-be.</p><p>They had to resist the power of time with all their might. They were no match for Lu Ming and bubbles. They did not have the power to fight back and were killed by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>As for their storage rings, they were naturally kept by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the remaining giant wolf, the quasi-emperors of the Golden Crow race, and the purple Extreme sect were all terrified as they madly rushed down the mountain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was even faster. In a flash, he appeared in front of the Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Golden Crow race’s quasi-Emperor roared, but as the sword fell, the man was also killed.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming charged toward the Emperor-to-be of the purple Extreme sect and killed this person.</p><p>After killing so many people, he had finally wasted some time. At this moment, the other giant wolf had already charged down the time mountain.</p><p>Without the power of time, it would not be so easy to kill him.</p><p>&Nbsp; the giant wolf ran down the time God mountain, trembling in fear. It didn’t dare to stay any longer. With a furious roar, it actually shot up into the sky and left.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to rush towards the peak of the time mountain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
