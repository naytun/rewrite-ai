He planned to head to the residence of the vast sea nine nations and bring ruan tianjiao and the rest away.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, none of you can escape, none of you can escape!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was about to leave, the sagemaster went crazy and started shouting madly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the sagemaster shouted, the time God mountain rumbled and shook violently.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>The sagemaster roared, his entire body emitting endless black light.</p><p>The divine time mountain continued to explode and shatter.</p><p>Then, the entire time God mountain cracked from the middle.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>Everyone could hear the clanging of chains coming from the time God mountain.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly focused.</p><p>This was because he saw a huge and majestic figure in the crack of the time God mountain.</p><p>This figure was in the form of an adult, but it was extremely huge. It was shrouded in a layer of black light, and its specific appearance could not be seen clearly.</p><p>His four limbs and neck were each shackled by a huge iron chain.</p><p>At this moment, the sagemaster turned into a black light and entered the huge black shadow.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The black shadow let out a loud roar, and his voice was actually the same as the sagemaster’s.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>The chains, the god of time mountain, and even the entire God of time Island were shaking.</p><p>&Nbsp; a terrifying time energy surged out of the massive black shadow, spreading in all directions.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Help!</p><p>Some of the absolute Saints let out shrill cries as the power of time passed through them. The next moment, their bodies withered and turned into skeletons.</p><p>Even some Emperor-to-be were the same.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The remaining Emperor-to-be’s expression changed and they fled frantically.</p><p>“Die, all of you must die!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” break! the massive black figure roared as it began to struggle, sending even more time energy surging outward in waves.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Some emperors-to-be were rushed by the power of time and let out roars of unwillingness. In the midst of their roars, they turned into bones.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles increased their speed to the maximum and charged towards ruan tianjiao and the rest.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was suddenly enlightened about many things.</p><p>He finally knew why the sagemaster had told him to destroy those altars.</p><p>That was because the sagemaster was the massive figure of the time God mountain. It was the soul power that had split off from that massive figure. The giant figure was obviously sealed here, and the three altars were the key to the seal.</p><p>The sagemaster had asked Lu Ming to destroy the three altars so that he could free himself.</p><p>As Lu Ming had destroyed an altar, the power of the seal had weakened. That was why the other party was able to destroy the divine mountain and reveal himself.</p><p>However, there were still two more altars, and the other party might not be able to come out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was secretly glad that he did not destroy the two altars. Otherwise, they would be in danger when the huge figure appeared.</p><p>That sagemaster really had a good scheme.</p><p>It was said that the divine light sacred island was built by the sagemaster.</p><p>Every three years, he would recruit a batch of powerful geniuses to cultivate on the divine time Island.</p><p>Lu Ming suspected that the sagemaster had established the divine time Island, gathered the paragons, and nurtured these people. His goal was to wait for these people to become stronger so that they could destroy the altar.</p><p>However, an ordinary Emperor-to-be would not be able to do so. This time, Lu Ming and the rest came to help the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fluctuations of the time God mountain grew more and more violent as the terrifying power of time burst forth in all directions. The area it covered was getting wider and wider. If this continued, the entire time God Island would probably be enveloped.</p><p>bubble, spacetime tunnel!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Pao Pao.</p><p>Bubbles nodded. With a wave of her hands, a space-time Tunnel appeared. Lu Ming entered the space-time Tunnel and in the next moment, he appeared at ruan tianjiao and the rest’s residence.</p><p>At this moment, the quaking of the time God mountain had also alarmed the other side. Many figures had gathered together and looked in the direction of the time God mountain in confusion.</p><p>Lu Ming’s sudden appearance by ruan tianjiao’s side gave them a huge shock.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>Ruan tian jiao asked subconsciously.</p><p>“There’s no time, I’ll take you guys away!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the mountain and river diagram. A beam of light enveloped ruan tianjiao and the rest, and they were kept into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“You guys hurry up and escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted at the others. Then, he soared into the sky and rushed out of the divine time Island.</p><p>As for the others, they couldn’t care so much. Whether they could escape with their lives would depend on their luck.</p><p>Those people were stunned, not knowing what had happened.</p><p>Hmph, I guess this person offended the sagemaster and is being hunted down. We’ve come to the sacred island with great difficulty. How can we leave just because of his words?”</p><p>The people from xuanling Kingdom snorted coldly. Lu Ming had killed so many of their experts. Why would they believe his words?</p><p>The people from the other countries nodded and agreed with what the man from mysterious spirit high land said. They felt that Lu Ming must have offended the sagemaster and was running for his life.</p><p>But following that, the rumbling sounds from the depths of the divine time Island grew more and more intense.</p><p>Following that, they saw streaks of light shooting out of the divine time Island with astonishing speed.</p><p>They were all foreign emperors-to-be, and some of them had been able to escape here.</p><p>it seems like something extraordinary has really happened!</p><p>Some people’s faces were pale.</p><p>In the next moment, screams rang out from the depths of the divine time Island. One figure after another shot up into the sky, wanting to escape.</p><p>However, an invisible fluctuation spread out and those people were fixed in the air. Then, their bodies shriveled up as if time had been deprived of them.</p><p>The older ones directly decayed!</p><p>The younger ones also aged in an instant, then rotted and turned into dry bones.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>These people were finally scared and rushed out like crazy.</p><p>However, they hadn’t flown very far when the terrifying power of time swept over them. Their bodies froze in the air and then rapidly aged, turning into bones that fell to the ground. Even their bones began to rot and turn into powder.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles opened up a spacetime tunnel once again. The two of them rushed out of the spacetime divine island’s boundary and flew into the distance at top speed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A terrifying roar came from the temporal Island. It was filled with anger and unwillingness.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming saw a streak of rainbow light rushing out of the divine time Island in a panic and rapidly disappearing into the distance.</p><p>They were several Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>The others who didn’t escape were probably dead.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and flew to the distance to observe from afar.</p><p>After that, a few more indignant roars rang out from the divine time Island before dying down.</p><p>It seemed that the huge figure had not escaped.</p><p>However, in the entire temporal divine Island, other than those who had managed to escape, no one else had managed to escape..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
