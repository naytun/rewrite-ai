Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>He Qian was a true Emperor expert. What matter did he have to discuss with him?</p><p>&Nbsp; when Ice Dragon Valley master heard this, his expression suddenly changed, and deep worry flashed through his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming and he Qian left their residence and came to a quiet place.</p><p>“It’s better for you to return to your original appearance. There’s no effect in changing your appearance in front of this old man!”</p><p>He Qian was the first to speak. He looked at Lu Ming with his bright eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change. He had long known that he Qian would definitely be able to tell.</p><p>He Qian was a true Emperor expert. At such a close distance, even the divine breath technique couldn’t hide from him.</p><p>Moreover, when he saw Tian Chui and ice Dragon Valley’s master earlier, the two of them were initially stunned, but they were soon overjoyed. From this point alone, it was not difficult to guess that Lu Ming had disguised himself.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming returned to his original appearance and cupped his fists.”Senior, junior had his own reasons for doing so and didn’t mean to hide it!”</p><p>“What’s your name? You don’t need to hide it from me, it’s not difficult for this old man to find out your background!”</p><p>He Qian’s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>“Junior’s name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered his real name after a moment of silence.</p><p>Just as he Qian had said, since he had revealed his true appearance, with the other party’s ability, it would be easy to find out who he was.</p><p>Moreover, the he family and the Heng family had a grudge. They wouldn’t tell the Heng family, right?</p><p>After hearing Lu Ming reveal his real name, he Qian’s expression changed, you’re Lu Ming, the son of chaos from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. The Lu Ming who pulled out the celestial Thearch sword and led the Kings to fight against the eternal Star River? ”</p><p>“If senior says so, then it’s junior!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>More than a year ago, Lu Ming had caused a huge commotion. Even now, the Heng family had Emperor-level experts guarding outside the yuan mountain Saint Academy. That incident had even triggered a battle between Emperor-level experts. Lu Ming’s name had long spread throughout the heavenly Emperor City. Anyone with some cultivation had heard of his name, haha, I’ve long heard of your great name. Now that I’ve seen you, you’re truly a peerless heaven’s favorite, a true dragon among men!</p><p>He Gao chuckled.</p><p>“Senior is too kind. I wonder why senior has called me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and asked.</p><p>He Qian didn’t specifically look for him just to ask about his true identity, right?</p><p>“I heard that you are Xiangxiang’s master?” He Qian spoke.</p><p>“That’s right, Xiangxiang Bella is my true disciple!” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I won’t hide it from you. Xiangxiang Bella’s physique is very suitable to inherit my legacy. Therefore, I also want to take her as my last disciple. However, Xiangxiang Bella said that it’s up to you. So, you’d better persuade her to take me as her master!”</p><p>He Qian went straight to the point and spoke his thoughts.</p><p>“Senior, are you asking me to persuade my disciple to switch sides?” Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>I’m just giving her a better choice. Lu Ming, I’m the true Emperor. Xiangxiang will be able to unleash her potential better if she’s under my tutelage. Furthermore, you’re in a precarious situation now. You’re surrounded by the Heng family. Xiangxiang is with you. Do you want her to take the risk with you?”</p><p>He Gao said.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming looked pensive.</p><p>Lu Ming, if you’re doing this for Xiangxiang, you should persuade her to join my family. She can only reach the peak with the he family’s resources supporting her!</p><p>He Qian continued.</p><p>senior, the matter of acknowledging a master is purely personal. 1 can go and persuade Xiangxiang, but whether she is willing or not will depend on her!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in the depths of he Qian’s eyes, and then he smiled and said,” that’s good. You go and persuade her first. Since you’ve reunited with an old friend, you can stay at the he family for a few more days!</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and he Qian called for someone to bring Lu Ming back to where Xiangxiang Bella was staying.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, a cold murderous intent flashed in he Qian’s eyes.</p><p>“Hmph, you want to brush me off, you really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>He Qian snorted coldly.</p><p>Based on his experience, he could tell at a glance that Lu Ming was just brushing him off. He did not really want to persuade Xiangxiang to be his master!</p><p>“I didn’t expect the master Xiangxiang Bella mentioned to be that brat Lu Ming. As long as that brat is dead, Xiangxiang Bella will still have to obediently acknowledge me as her master and cultivate the Four Seasons technique!” “Moreover, this kid is very valuable now!”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in he Qian’s eyes. Then, he took a step out of the he clan and headed in another direction of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Not long after, a vast palace complex appeared in front of them.</p><p>This was the Heng family.</p><p>He Qian wanted to kill with a borrowed knife, the Heng family’s knife!</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>He Qian’s arrival at the Heng family naturally alerted the Heng family’s experts.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura of a true Emperor erupted from he Qian’s body, enveloping the entire Hall of the Heng family.</p><p>“Get your true Emperor to come out and see me!”</p><p>He Qian’s voice rang out.</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying aura erupted from the Heng family’s Palace complex. A middle-aged man stepped out and stood in the air, looking at he Qian.</p><p>“He Qian, you old fogey, why have you come to my Heng family?”</p><p>The true Emperor expert from the Heng clan said coldly.</p><p>The Heng family and the he family had never been on good terms since ancient times, so he naturally didn’t treat he Qian well.</p><p>“I’m here to make a deal with you!”</p><p>He Qian said with a slight smile.</p><p>“What deal?”</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor said.</p><p>“It’s regarding Lu Ming’s deal!”</p><p>He Gao said.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Isn’t he in the yuan mountain sacred Academy? don’t tell me you have a way to enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy and capture Lu Ming?” The Heng family’s true Emperor sneered in disdain.</p><p>There were three great emperors in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Even the great emperor from the Heng family had no way of entering the yuan mountain sacred Academy directly to capture Lu Ming. He didn’t believe that the other party had a way.</p><p>who said that Lu Ming is in the yuan mountain sacred Institute now? ”</p><p>He Qian smiled.</p><p>not at the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Impossible. Our Heng family has always had experts guarding the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor’s expression changed.</p><p>Hmph, that’s because you Heng family people are useless. Lu Ming has already left the yuan mountain sacred Institute!</p><p>He Gao sneered.</p><p>“He Qian, do you know where Lu Ming is?”</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor’s eyes lit up.</p><p>that’s right, but i can’t give you the information for free. You have to pay a price!</p><p>He Gao said.</p><p>“What do you need?” The Heng clan’s true Emperor’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Divine tribulation clothes!”</p><p>He Qian slowly opened his mouth.</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor’s expression changed drastically as he shouted,” divine clothing for tribulation transcendence. He Qian, you’re simply asking for an exorbitant price. This is impossible!</p><p>To a Martial Emperor, the divine clothes for tribulation transcendence were shockingly valuable.</p><p>This was because the divine robe could help martial sovereigns transcend their tribulations. It was several times more valuable than ordinary tribulation-transcending heavenly treasures.</p><p>An ordinary tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure was completely useless to a Martial Emperor powerhouse.</p><p>However, the divine clothing for tribulation transcendence was extremely useful to even void emperors and true emperors. It could increase the success rate of transcending the Tribulation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
