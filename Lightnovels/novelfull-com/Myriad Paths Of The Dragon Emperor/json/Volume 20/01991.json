At the same time, his third eye would shoot out a destructive light from time to time. Its power was astonishing.</p><p>The strange beast would also attack Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; the spear trembled, and hundreds of spear lights shot toward the three-eyed God.</p><p>At the same time, he pointed out a finger with his left hand.</p><p>Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying finger force condensed into a thread and pierced out.</p><p>This finger wasn’t aimed at the three-eyed God, but at the beast beneath it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The strange beast s combat strength was equivalent to that of an ordinary Emperor-to-be, so it couldn’t resist it at all. It was pierced through between its eyebrows and died on the spot, its corpse falling to the ground.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The three-eyed God bellowed in rage, his killing intent growing even colder as he launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in his right hand. Dense runes appeared on it.</p><p>Soon, the symbols covered the long spear. Then, the long spear was thrust out, forming a true dragon that whistled out.</p><p>Lu Ming was using the long spear to cast rhe illusionary spirit scroll of the nine scrolls of the array Dao.</p><p>However, the true dragon was dispersed by the other party’s axe.</p><p>This was within Lu Ming’s expectations. The long spear shook and a destructive force burst out.</p><p>This was the annihilation manual of rhe nine scrolls of rhe array Dao.</p><p>Lu Ming was using his opponent to train his nine scrolls of array Dao, striving to merge the sealed scroll, the destruction scroll, and the illusionary spirit scroll together as soon as possible.</p><p>To be honest, the king physique of the Emperor-to-be realm was very powerful and required Lu Ming to go all out.</p><p>Lu Ming was undoubtedly at a disadvantage when he used the nine volumes of the array Dao alone. He was being suppressed by his opponent.</p><p>However, this was exactly what Lu Ming needed. In the face of adversity, his nine scrolls of array Dao had progressed at a rapid pace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, hundreds of moves had been exchanged!</p><p>“Yes, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes suddenly lit up and he thrust his spear.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A true dragon flew out and pounced at the other party.</p><p>“This move again, break!”</p><p>The three-eyed God roared as he cleaved the true dragon into two.</p><p>However, the true dragon immediately exploded and turned into countless runes. They enveloped the other party’s battle axe and spread along the battle axe to the other party’s entire body, forming a powerful sealing force.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming had successfully combined the illusionary spirit scroll and the sealed scroll with that move.</p><p>Two of the nine scrolls of the array Dao were contained in one move.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The three-eyed God roared as he unleashed his full power. The black light around his body intensified, and the runes dimmed before collapsing.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear again. Another true dragon flew out and collided with his opponent’s battle-ax. This time, there was a shocking boom and his opponent’s battle-ax buzzed and vibrated.</p><p>This move was a combination of the illusionary spirit scroll and the annihilation scroll. Its power was greatly increased and it successfully blocked the opponent s attack.</p><p>“If I combine the three volumes, the power will be even stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. At rhe same time, he kept stabbing with his long spear but he failed in the end.</p><p>Fusing three volumes was much more difficult than fusing two.</p><p>“If I can combine the annihilation manual with the primal Chaos tribulation finger, wouldn’t the power of the primal Chaos tribulation finger increase exponentially?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly had an idea and his eyes lit up.</p><p>The primal Chaos tribulation finger was already very powerful, but with the array Dao laws destruction scroll, its power would definitely be even stronger.</p><p>However, this involved the fusion of two types of nomological laws, which was even more profound.</p><p>Lu Ming tried a few times but he did not succeed.</p><p>However, this was a direction. As long as Lu Ming kept trying, he would eventually succeed.</p><p>“Now, I’ll finish you off!”</p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He kept stabbing with his long spear, using the illusionary spirit scroll and the sealed scroll’s fusion technique, &Nbsp; at the same time, he used the primal Chaos tribulation finger with his left hand to attack from both sides.</p><p>boom! boom! boom!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves and Lu Ming finally gained the upper hand. His opponent s body was wrapped in a layer of dense runes and his strength was affected.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and the chaotic finger of tribulation pierced through the other party’s body. Half of the body exploded.</p><p>The other party roared, turned around, and ran.</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase, but the other party was indeed very strong and could stand shoulder to shoulder with Lu Ming. He risked his injuries and ran away at top speed, escaping far away.</p><p>Lu Ming could only give up on the pursuit.</p><p>The combat strength of an Emperor-to-be King body was indeed very powerful. Lu Ming had to use his full strength and the combination of two types of laws to defeat the other party. However, he still could not kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and brought Xiangxiang Bella with him to continue hunting the three-eyed God.</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Luo Xiang were fighting a life-and-death battle with two Emperor-to-be.</p><p>It was very difficult for the three of them to fight against two Emperor-to-be experts. It was a real life-and-death battle where their lives were in danger at any time.</p><p>Huang Ling used the law of the undying fire to cast the undying cage. While she attacked, she also achieved a defensive effect.</p><p>As for Long Chen, his entire body swelled up like a giant. Every attack he made was accompanied by the trumpeting of elephants and the stomping of divine statues as he attacked his opponent.</p><p>As for Luo Xiang, he was wandering around with an iron sword in his hand, it looked rusty, but it was extremely sharp. His body was sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and the speed of his sword was also sometimes fast and sometimes slow, making it impossible to guard against.</p><p>Even so, under the terrifying attack of the other party’s Emperor-to-be, they were still in a dangerous situation and facing a fatal crisis.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be suddenly pounced at Luo Xiang with all his might. The terrifying power sealed the space around Luo Xiang, making it difficult for him to move at his maximum speed.</p><p>Then, a violent attack was launched at Luo Xiang.</p><p>Among the three of them, Luo Xiang’s cultivation was the lowest. They had to kill him first before killing the others.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen’s expressions changed. They wanted to help but were blocked by the other Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be’s eyes were filled with ferocity as he charged at Luo Xiang.</p><p>In the face of a life and death crisis, Luo Xiang was very calm. He squinted his eyes, which were shining with a terrifying sharpness.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the sword soul was shaking, and the iron sword in his hand was buzzing.</p><p>At this moment, he circulated all of his power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword light burst out and lit up the sky. It was extremely stunning.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The three-eyed God s attack was broken through.</p><p>“These kids must die!”</p><p>The three-eyed God roared in his heart. These young men were too strong. When they matured in the future, they would definitely be the greatest enemies of their race.</p><p>He once again charged towards Luo Xiang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The iron sword in Luo Xiang’s hand trembled and emitted a dazzling light. At this moment, a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>At the critical moment, Luo Xiang broke through.</p><p>His cultivation had been at the limit of the upper-tier of the absolute Saint realm, and now, facing a life-and-death crisis, he broke through and entered the peak of the absolute Saint realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
