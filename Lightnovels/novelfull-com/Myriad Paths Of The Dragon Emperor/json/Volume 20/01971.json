Compared to the chaos finger tribulation, it was still a little weaker.</p><p>However, if he were to combine the annihilation manual, the iilusionary spirit manual, and the sealed manual together, the power would definitely increase exponentially.</p><p>One could only imagine how powerful the attack would be if it transformed into a true dragon that contained both the power of destruction and the power of sealing.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it.</p><p>At this moment, Luo cangqiong’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually kill the burly man, who was a top-notch</p><p>Emperor-to-be. Unless one had a King physique, he was invincible among his peers. The fact that Lu Ming could kill such an existence sent chills down his spine.</p><p>Lu Ming s cold eyes swept towards Luo cangqiong. He did not stop and continued to charge at Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Men, kill Lu Ming. Kill him!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared as he frantically retreated.</p><p>Luo pokong also retreated with him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; WhooshL..</p><p>In an instant, at least ten Emperor-to-be rushed toward Lu Ming with all kinds of terrifying attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming simply ignored these attacks.</p><p>His chaotic light surrounded his body, and as he charged forward, all the attacks that landed on his chaotic light were ail blocked.</p><p>The light of chaos could be used to attack and defend, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>boom! boom! boom!</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed through the attacks, he threw a few punches in a row. His fist radiance tore through the air and the three Emperor-to-be exploded in the air.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming pointed out the fingers of tribulation of chaos in succession. Six fingers of tribulation of chaos shot toward the six Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Although the power of the six fingers had been dispersed, it was enough to deal with an ordinary Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The six Emperor-to-be were blown away by the six finger forces. Their faces were pale and they spat out blood.</p><p>In the beginning, he killed three Emperor-to-be, and then he injured six. This kind of combat strength was shocking.</p><p>Luo cangqiong and Luo pokong were even more shocked.</p><p>The two of them retreated frantically. They did not have the courage to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Luo cangqiong retreated even faster because his cultivation was stronger.</p><p>“You guys can’t escape!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said coldly. He dashed out like a bolt of lightning and avoided several powerhouses of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming caught up to Luo pokong.</p><p>Luo pokong was shocked. The long spear in his hand pierced through the void and went straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a monarch weapon. Combined with Luo pokong s law of penetration, its power was indeed terrifying.</p><p>However, Luo PC’s cultivation base was only at the upper tier of the absolute Saint realm, the same as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, no matter how strong he was, he was not strong enough to face Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it hit the tip of the long spear.</p><p>Luo pokong s penetration law was useless against Lu Ming.</p><p>The long spear buzzed and even bent. Then, it bounced out fiercely, and the tail of the spear hit Luo pokong s body. Luo pokong let out a blood-curdling scream, and his body retreated frantically.</p><p>In his heart, there was a strong sense of disbelief. He felt like he was dreaming.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming had to do his best to defeat him.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could defeat him and injure him with a casual move.</p><p>As time passed, the gap between the two of them grew bigger and bigger.</p><p>Luo pokong, who claimed to be a peerless genius, found it hard to accept.</p><p>Lu Ming s figure did not stop as he charged towards Luo pokong. His cold killing intent sent chills down Luo pokong1 s spine.</p><p>Lu Ming, how dare you touch me! I’m the Daluo heaven sect’s pride. If you touch me, no one in Yuan mountain can save you!</p><p>Luo pokong roared.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect had a great emperor in charge. He did not believe that Lu Ming would dare to touch him.</p><p>If he touched him, Lu Ming would also die.</p><p>in my life, many people have threatened me, but in the end, they all died, and I’m still alive!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His Saint power burst out, and the law of chaos buzzed. He threw a punch, and a Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele pressed toward Luo pokong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo pokong was directly sent flying to the ground, smashing heavily on the ground, creating a huge pit that was ten miles deep.</p><p>Luo pokong lay in the pit, twitching and spitting out blood.</p><p>That attack had broken all his bones and armor, and even his Saint heart had cracked.</p><p>At this moment, he was extremely terrified. Endless fear enveloped him.</p><p>If Lu Ming really wanted to kill him, he was not just saying it. He was not afraid of the Daluo heaven sect at all.</p><p>At this moment, he was scared to death.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming s body appeared in the huge pit and he looked down at Luo pokong coldly.</p><p>“Don’t… Don’t…”</p><p>Luo pokong shouted as he vomited blood.</p><p>stop! Lu Ming, if you dare to kill him, the Daluo heaven sect will not let you off!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect shouted.</p><p>Luo pokong was the king body of the Daluo heaven sect, so he couldn’t die.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect would not let him go? Even if the Daluo heaven sect would let him go, he would not let them go. This was the oath he made to Qin Yue.</p><p>In the future, he would definitely trample on the Daluo heaven sect, no matter what price he had to pay.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed Luo pokong s monarch weapon spear.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Luo pokong shouted in fear and tried to escape.</p><p>However, the spear radiance pierced through the air. The monarch weapon spear pierced through Luo pokong’s forehead and nailed him to the ground.</p><p>Luo pokong s eyes were wide open, full of unwillingness.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were also shocked.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect’s King physique, Luo pokong, was killed by Lu Ming just like that. The people of the Daluo heaven sect would go crazy if this news spread.</p><p>However, the murderous intent in Lu Ming’s eyes was still as cold as a knife.</p><p>“This is only the beginning!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and pulled out his monarch weapon spear. He soared into the sky and looked into the distance.</p><p>At this moment, Luo cangqiong was fleeing frantically. He did not dare to stay there at all.</p><p>“Bubble, give me a hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Under the Dayan elixir furnace, the bubble responded. It waved its hands and the power of space-time laws enveloped Lu Ming’s body through the void.</p><p>Lu Ming s body moved as if he was traveling through the void, and he chased after Luo cangqiong at an extreme speed.</p><p>With the help of bubbles space-time law, Lu Ming’s speed was even more astonishing. He was approaching Luo cangqiong at a rapid speed.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect stopped their attacks on Feng Ling and Long Chen and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Luo pokong was still fine, but if Luo cangqiong was killed by Lu Ming, the great Emperor’s Fury would descend upon them and they would all die.</p><p>They chased after Lu Ming crazily, but their speed was too far behind Lu Ming’s and they could not catch up at all.</p><p>Lu Ming s figure was like a flickering light and a passing shadow as he approached Luo cangqiong very quickly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed with his finger. T he force of the chaotic finger of calamity condensed into a line and pierced through Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A battleaxe appeared in Luo cangqiong’s hand.</p><p>This battle-axe was extremely powerful. It was definitely a monarch weapon, and not an ordinary one at that.</p><p>The battle axe slashed out and blocked Lu Ming’s finger force. However, his body was also sent flying and his face was flushed.</p><p>Although his cultivation base had broken through to the perfected absolute Saint realm, his combat strength was much weaker than Lu Ming’s..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
