They groaned and flew back, landing beside Lu Ming. Their faces were pale and blood was flowing out of their mouths.</p><p>“Qiuyue, Feng Ling, are you guys alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked worriedly.</p><p>“Young master, it’s fine. 1 want to fight alongside you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth. She stood beside Lu Ming with a determined look in her eyes.</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling didn’t speak, but the imperishable flame on her body burned even more fiercely.</p><p>“Hehe, how can you stop me with just two girls?”</p><p>Xing Chen sneered and continued to walk forward. The aura on his body became more and more terrifying.</p><p>“I’m the one who’s cursing! ”</p><p>A burly figure appeared beside Huang Ling. It was desolate power.</p><p>The muscles on his body bulged as he circulated his laws. He wore a pair of pitch-black gloves on his hands, which were also sovereign weapons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another figure flashed by. Long Chen appeared beside Qiu Yue. His arms were bulging, and his aura was terrifying.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, Huang Li, and Lu Ming-four King physiques and one son of chaos-stood side by side. All of them were at the initial success stage of the absolute Saint realm. Their auras combined to resist the aura of the eternal Star River.</p><p>“Add us in!”</p><p>Behind them, the other elites of the desolate race, as well as mu Qingxue and company, also wanted to step forward.</p><p>“Don’t come up!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and asked the desolate land and the rest to stop.</p><p>When facing an opponent like the stellar River, numbers did not mean anything. If one’s combat power was insufficient, it would be useless no matter how many people they had.</p><p>“You want to bully me with your numbers? Do you think we don’t have people?”</p><p>Another genius of the Heng family shouted and stepped forward. The other geniuses of the Heng family also followed.</p><p>“All of you, back off. You don’t need to interfere in this matter! ”</p><p>Xing Chen waved his hand and said to the other geniuses of the Heng family.</p><p>He was a proud person. With his cultivation, he did nor need the help of others to deal with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Ills gaze swept across Lu Ming’s group of five and he said indifferently, ” you think that you can contend with me with just the five of you? how naive!</p><p>Around them, the others also sighed.</p><p>The lineup of Lu Ming’s team could be said to be luxurious.</p><p>The four King bodies and the Son of chaos had all reached the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, they were facing the eternal Son, Heng Xinghe, who was ranked first on the Saint King rankings. No one had any objections.</p><p>He was publicly acknowledged as the strongest expert of the younger generation in Yuan mountain.</p><p>Even the death blade, the son of death, was unable to shake the position of the Galaxy.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s team of five was Grand, their cultivation was weaker.</p><p>Could they really fight against the eternal Star River?</p><p>“What if I’m included?”</p><p>At this time, a deep voice rang out. A tall and slender figure stepped out from the crowd.</p><p>“It’s Ouyang Wushuang!”</p><p>Someone recognized the person.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang came to Lu Ming s side and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Absolute Saint!</p><p>Obviously, Ouyang Wushuang had also reached the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>“Then let’s add little sister!”</p><p>At this time, another voice sounded.</p><p>A graceful figure stepped through the void and landed beside Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Luo Tianyi!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and Luo Tianyi both helped Lu Ming. Are they familiar with him?”</p><p>six King physiques and one son of chaos. This lineup is truly astonishing!</p><p>Many people gasped and found it hard to calm down.</p><p>Luo Tianyi and Ouyang Wushuang were actually familiar with Lu Ming. They attacked at this time and wanted to fight against the star River with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>very good, very good. Then I’ll see how strong you are!</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes were filled with battle intent. He took a step forward and the void space under his feet trembled.</p><p>“Heavenly illusion!’”</p><p>Luo Tianyi shouted. Her eyes turned into two black vortexes.</p><p>She cast the sky illusion technique and enveloped the eternal Star River, trying to make the eternal Star River fall into an illusion.</p><p>At this time, Luo Tianyi’s cultivation was revealed. She had reached the absolute Saint realm and seemed to have reached the limit of the absolute Saint realm. She was not far from the peak of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>As expected, Xinghe’s body trembled slightly, and he stopped.</p><p>The moment Luo Tianyi made her move, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, Huang Li, Long Chen, and Ouyang Wushuang also made their moves.</p><p>Six terrifying super powers exploded at the same time and blasted towards the star River.</p><p>The shockwaves created by the six of them were earth-shaking and shook people’s minds.</p><p>“A mere illusion can’t stop me. Break!”</p><p>Xing Chen’s indifferent voice rang out. His eyes were as bright as the stars. Two terrifying sword lights burst out from his eyes and slashed at the void.</p><p>Luo Tianyi cried out. Her body trembled and she retreated. Her face turned pale and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Her illusion had been broken by the Galaxy and suffered a backlash, causing her to be injured.</p><p>At the same time, a sword light condensed in Xing Chen’s hand and he slashed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This sword radiance was like a fairy from beyond the heavens. It cut through the void and turned into eternity. It was unparalleled and breathtaking.</p><p>boom! boom! boom!</p><p>The sword radiance slashed across and the attacks of Lu Ming and the other five were all shattered in the air.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The six of them retreated rapidly to avoid the aftermath of the sword light.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The combat power of the Galaxy was indeed terrifying and unrivaled.</p><p>The main reason was that their cultivation level was too low, far inferior to that of the eternal Star River.</p><p>“What’s the use of having so many people?”</p><p>The Galaxy’s palm clenched into a fist and the eternal law condensed into a sword beam, pressing toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming s glabella glowed and the Tai Chi formation disk floated out.</p><p>Qiu Yue and the others also took out their monarch weapons^</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming took the lead in attacking. He used all his might to launch a chaotic finger of tribulation. At the same time, he moved and rushed toward the Galaxy at top speed. Countless runes filled his left hand and formed a sealing force that spread toward the Galaxy.</p><p>At the same time, the Tai Chi yin and yang pattern appeared on the Tai Chi formation disk and turned into two Yin Yang fish swords, slashing toward the star River.</p><p>The series of attacks was like a storm. Even an ordinary absolute Saint in the perfection stage would be killed by Lu Ming s wave of attacks.</p><p>At the same time as Lu Ming launched his attack, the others also launched their attacks.</p><p>“It’s both real and illusionary!”</p><p>die! Luo Tianyi shouted. Butterflies appeared in the sky, flapping their wings and flying toward the star River.</p><p>These butterflies were formed by an illusion. They could be real or fake, and their power was astonishing.</p><p>The attacks of Qiu Yue and the others also headed towards the Galaxy.</p><p>“What a terrifying attack!”</p><p>The surrounding geniuses were all shocked. With so many people joining forces, no one else was confident that they could stop them, not even the geniuses who were ranked high on the Saint King ranking.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression did not change. lie slashed out the sword gleam in his hand. In an instant, nine sword gleams slashed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Three of the sword gleams slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The other seven people each had one Dao..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
