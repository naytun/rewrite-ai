I’ll leave the divine Dragon Army in your hands for this period of time!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao looked at the generals.</p><p>“Marshal, let’s just rebel!”</p><p>One of the officers said.</p><p>that’s right. His Majesty is fatuous and infatuated with Consort Qing. He doesn’t care about the state affairs and all the power is controlled by the state preceptor. The people are in misery and suffering. Why don’t we rebel and replace him?”</p><p>the Marshal is the goddess of war and has contributed greatly to the Ming Yan Kingdom. The people will definitely welcome the Marshal to replace her!</p><p>A few of the generals spoke out one after another, persuading ruan tianjiao to rebel and kill his way to the capital.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted, and everyone shut up.</p><p>the ruan family has been loyal generals for generations. How can we rebel? in the future, there is no need to mention such things again. Otherwise, we will be punished by military law!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted, his eyes like lightning, causing the generals “expressions to turn ugly and indignant.</p><p>Marshal, we’ll go with you to the capital tomorrow. If the Yan family has any schemes, we’ll be able to look out for them!</p><p>One of the officers said.</p><p>“No need. Your mission is to guard the divine Dragon Army. 1 have the power to protect myself!”</p><p>Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“I’ll go with you tomorrow!”</p><p>A voice was heard. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming had seen everything that happened just now.</p><p>He was originally going to the capital, so he was going with ruan tianjiao.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao looked at Lu Ming and then nodded.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming and ruan tianjiao each rode a strange beast and headed towards the capital of mingyan country.</p><p>This Island was very vast, but the strange beasts they were riding on were astonishingly fast. Like a gust of wind, they arrived at the capital of Ming Yan in three days.</p><p>On the way, ruan tianjiao explained the situation in mingyan country.</p><p>Ever since Ming Yan country’s Emperor fell in love with consort Shan Qing, he abandoned the government and the Imperial advisor took control.</p><p>For the sake of his own cultivation, the Imperial advisor plundered the treasures of the entire mingyan country, causing the people to live in poverty and the country’s strength to decline day by day.</p><p>Now, the most powerful person in Ming Yan country was the Imperial advisor.</p><p>The capital of the mingyan Kingdom was huge and lively. However, Lu Ming had seen the prosperity of the heavenly Emperor City. Compared to the heavenly Emperor City, the capital of the mingyan Kingdom was like a wild village.</p><p>The two of them rode on their strange beasts and entered the capital, heading towards the palace.</p><p>greetings, Marshal Tian Jiao!</p><p>“Greetings, Heavenly Serpent female war god!”</p><p>The moment they entered the capital, the people on the road all saluted ruan tian jiao when they saw him.</p><p>“It seems like you’re loved by the people!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sent a voice transmission to ruan tianjiao.</p><p>“I’m only doing my part!” Ruan tianjiao nodded to everyone and continued forward.</p><p>sigh, such a peerless person like general Tian Jiao actually has to marry that bastard Yan Song. What a pity!</p><p>“Isn’t that so? But now that the Yan family is so powerful that even his Majesty listens to them, what can we do?”</p><p>it’s just a pity for Marshal Heavenly Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming could hear the People’s laments and discussions.</p><p>Not long after, they came to a stretch of Palace halls. This was the Imperial Palace, but they were blocked outside the Imperial Palace.</p><p>general Tian Jiao, please forgive us. His Majesty has ordered that we will not see anyone for the next two days!</p><p>A general who was guarding the gate cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Go and report that I’ve returned!” Ruan tianjiao said with a frown.</p><p>His Majesty has said that if Marshal Tian Jiao returns, there is no need to inform him. His Majesty will prepare a banquet three days later to welcome the Marshal. Marshal, please come back three days later!</p><p>The general at the gate said.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao frowned. He did not say anything else and left the palace with Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived in front of a mansion with the words ” The ruan residence.</p><p>This was ruan tianjiao’s residence in the capital.</p><p>They were temporarily staying at the ruan residence.</p><p>After arranging a room for Lu Ming, ruan tianjiao left the ruan residence for an unknown reason.</p><p>A day later, ruan tianjiao returned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve brought you the information you wanted about the ancient monument!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao found Lu Ming and handed him a Jade tablet.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. Indeed, he found some ancient relics in the ten thousand seas realm.</p><p>“Heavenly Serpent, where is the most famous relic in the ten thousand sea realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked after a while.</p><p>of course it’s the time God mountain. Legend has it that the time God mountain has existed for countless years and was left behind by an undying!</p><p>Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“Undying?!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>During this time, he had a deeper understanding of the martial arts cultivation and realms in the ten thousand sea realm.</p><p>The realms and titles in the ten-thousand sea realm were the same as those in the outside world. They went all the way to the Martial Emperor, then the bright Saint, the Supreme Saint, and the absolute Saint.</p><p>However, after he became an absolute Saint, there were changes.</p><p>Above absolute Saint, the ten thousand sea realm was called Saint Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that a Sacred Emperor was equivalent to an Emperor-to-be in the outside world.</p><p>According to the ancient records and legends of the mingyan country, the Holy Emperor was the highest realm in the world.</p><p>Further up was the undying.</p><p>Immortality, endless lifespan, undying and imperishable.</p><p>But in the ten thousand sea realm, it was a legend. It had never appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the immortal in the ten-thousand sea realm was the Martial Emperor in the outside world.</p><p>The time God mountain was left behind by an undying being. Could it be the celestial Thearch?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had to go and take a look at the time God mountain. It might have something to do with the celestial Thearch.</p><p>“How can 1 go to the time God mountain?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know either!”</p><p>no! ruan tianjiao shook his head,” legend has it that the time God mountain is on the time God Island, but no one has ever found it!</p><p>“Has no one been there before?” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>of course, someone has. Every three years, the time Island sends an emissary to bring a group of people to the island to cultivate. It’s said that the cultivation conditions there are unique, and it’s a Holy Land of martial arts that countless people in the myriad sea realm yearn for.</p><p>it’s not too far away from the time of the next trip to the divine time Island. Soon, the nine nations of the vast sea will have an Alliance meeting to select a quota to go to the divine time Island. The mingyan Kingdom will also be participating. Lu Ming, if you want to go to the divine time Island, this is an opportunity!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao explained.</p><p>“An Alliance of the nine nations?”</p><p>There was a flash of light in Lu Ming’s eyes. He definitely had to make a trip to the time mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that the experts who entered from the outside world would most likely head to the time God mountain.</p><p>After all, it was suspected to have been left behind by the celestial Emperor. If there were any treasures, they would definitely be priceless.</p><p>Time flew by and three days passed.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming and ruan tianjiao headed for the palace. This time, someone welcomed them into the palace and they came to an empty space.</p><p>This place had beautiful mountains and clear waters, and the environment was very elegant.</p><p>At this time, there were already some banquet tables placed on both sides of the area. When Lu Ming and Qiao Mu arrived, they realized that there were already many people.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, he felt a cold gaze directed at him. Lu Ming followed the direction of the gaze and found Yan Song staring at him with a murderous look.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.
