He looked at the two half-Saints and chided,” “Back down!”</p><p>The bodies of the two half-Saints stiffened. They didn’t know whether to move or not. Finally, they turned their eyes to Yan Song.</p><p>“Heavenserpent, what do you mean by this? This person is a spy…”</p><p>Yan song’s expression was a little unsightly.</p><p>as 1 said, he’s not a spy, but my guest. Also, this is the divine Dragon Army, not the Yan family. I’m the Marshal of the divine Dragon Army. Do you understand?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s eyes were like lightning as he finally glanced at the two half-Saints. The two half-Saints ‘expressions were ugly, but they still retreated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao nodded at Lu Ming and walked forward.</p><p>Yan song’s expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao took a few steps and stopped. He looked at Yan Song and said,”Yan Song, I’m telling you, don’t call me by my name in the future. We’re not that close!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he no longer paid any attention to Yan Song and strode forward.</p><p>“Damn you, bitch!”</p><p>Yan song’s fists were tightly clenched. His face, which could be considered handsome, was contorted in anger.</p><p>“That Yan Song seems to be very interested in you!”</p><p>After walking for a while, Lu Ming smiled and said.</p><p>Hmph, isn’t he just relying on the fact that his father is the current state preceptor and his sister is the emperor’s most beloved imperial concubine to do as he pleases? he’s lawless and is a typical hedonistic son. He has harmed countless women from good families. Now, he has actually come to the camp of the divine Dragon Army to pester me!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said with a cold face.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself,’it seems that ruan tianjiao’s impression of Yan Song is really bad.’</p><p>“Lu Ming, Yan Song is a narrow-minded person. You’ve offended him today, so you must be careful in the future!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao warned.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his expression indifferent.</p><p>A mere Yan Song wasn’t worthy of his attention.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a military tent. This would be where Lu Ming would be staying in the future.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is a Military Order. Take it. You can enter and leave the divine Dragon Army’s camp freely in the future!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao passed a token to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming received it and cupped his fists to express his gratitude. He was a little surprised. He had just met ruan tianjiao and the other party trusted him so much?</p><p>After that, Lu Ming temporarily stayed in the divine Dragon Army.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed. Lu Ming and some of ruan tianjiao’s subordinates had become quite familiar with each other.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he also knew more about this world, the mingyan country, and even ruan tianjiao.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming was that ruan tianjiao’s status in mingyan country was higher than he had imagined.</p><p>Ming Yan country’s goddess of war, this was how everyone in Ming Yan country addressed ruan tianjiao.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao came from a military family and had rare talent. He was young, but his cultivation had already reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. He stood at the peak of mingyan country and was one of the strongest people there. He had made great contributions to the country and was known as the goddess of war. He was loved by the people.</p><p>As for Yan Song, he was the son of the current state preceptor, and his sister was the country ruler’s most beloved imperial concubine, with power that could topple the entire mingyan country.</p><p>Yan Song was lecherous by nature and had harmed countless women. Now, he had set his sights on ruan tianjiao and often ran to the camp of the divine Dragon Army to harass him.</p><p>“It seems that the martial arts in this world are not very high!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>According to Lu Ming’s understanding, he realized that the martial arts in this world were not high and could not be compared to that of Yuan Lu.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s cultivation was at the great circle of the bright Saint stage. In the country of mingyan, he was already a peak expert.</p><p>Time flew by, and several days passed.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on a mountain peak and looked into the distance.</p><p>On the flat land in front of them, an Army was galloping on strange beasts. Their killing intent was like a rainbow, forming a huge flood Dragon that roared into the sky.</p><p>it’s a pretty good Army. They’ve been through hundreds of battles. It’s a pity that their cultivation is a little weak, and their battle formation isn’t exquisite enough!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Not long after, a few figures stepped through the air and landed in front of Lu Ming. It was ruan tianjiao and a few of his subordinates.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you think of my Divine Dragon Army?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao asked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“Can’t?” Ruan tianjiao revealed a stunned expression.</p><p>“You’re boasting shamelessly, kid. You don’t know anything, do you? the divine Dragon Army is the number one army among the five strongest armies in the mingyan country. How dare you say you can’t do it? what a joke!”</p><p>One of ruan tianjiao’s subordinates was instantly enraged. His eyes widened as if he could not wait to eat Lu Ming.</p><p>no means no. Other than his fighting spirit and baleful Qi, he’s completely useless, especially his battle formation!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. Since ruan tianjiao wanted to ask him, he would naturally tell him the truth.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>A few of the officers glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>They initially thought that Lu Ming might be the number one figure. Now, they felt that Lu Ming was just a person who talked big.</p><p>Lu Ming, my flood dragon battle formation is the number one battle formation in mingyan country. How could you say that it’s useless!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s expression did not look too good either. He looked at Lu Ming with a hint of ‘hidden bitterness’!</p><p>“You were the one who asked me, I’m just speaking from my heart!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>“So you have an even stronger battle formation?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao continued to look at Lu Ming with ‘hidden bitterness’.</p><p>“Yes, I do. Take a look at this!”</p><p>A Jade tablet appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he threw it to ruan tianjiao.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao took the Jade token and after scanning it with his spiritual sense, he cried out,” “This is … The true dragon battle formation, what a wondrous battle formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming had indeed given the true dragon battle formation to ruan tianjiao. Back then, when he was helping Ouyang Wushuang fight for the position of Crown Prince, he had duplicated a few Jade tokens. This battle formation was not of much use to Lu Ming, so there was no harm in giving it to ruan tianjiao.</p><p>Seeing ruan tianjiao lose his composure, a few of the generals looked at each other. Could it be that Lu Ming had really given them a battle formation that was stronger than the flood dragon battle formation?</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s mind sank into the Jade token, carefully studying it as if he was entranced.</p><p>After a moment, she was overjoyed and said,” immediately train the new battle formation!</p><p>Then, he rushed toward the battlefield, and the four generals followed him with confused faces.</p><p>In the following time, ruan tianjiao was focused on training the new combat formation. If there was anything he did not understand, he would come and ask Lu Ming.</p><p>In a short ten days, the battle formation training had taken shape.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Army gathered and activated the true dragon battle formation. A true dragon formed and roared into the sky. Its might was many times stronger than the flood Dragon from before.</p><p>At this moment, ruan tianjiao and her subordinates were already in awe of Lu Ming.</p><p>No one suspected that Lu Ming was a spy.</p><p>How could a spy give them such a brilliant battle formation to cultivate?</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was even more glad that her intuition was right. Lu Ming was definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p>Lu Ming had given her such a precious battle formation so casually as if he did not take it seriously.. How could he be an ordinary person?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
