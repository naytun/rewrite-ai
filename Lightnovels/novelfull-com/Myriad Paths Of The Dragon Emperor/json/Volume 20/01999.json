If we can control it, we can seal the void passageway of the evil god tribe. It’s a pity that we’ve tried all kinds of methods, but we can’t control this stone disc. That’s why we thought of you!</p><p>you’re the son of chaos, and you cultivate the Laws of Chaos. You might be able to control this stone plate and revive it!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 try!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped forward to the stone tray.</p><p>The stone plate was huge, like a small mountain. Lu Ming circulated the law of chaos and spread it toward the stone plate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the Laws of Chaos enveloped the stone plate, it seemed to resonate with the stone plate, and the stone plate trembled.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The eyes of Emperor formless, Emperor Skyfire, and Emperor huntian all lit</p><p>up.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the chaos laws, constantly enveloping the stone plate from a distance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone plate began to shake violently. Because it had been there for too long, it was covered in a layer of rocks. At this time, the rocks shattered, revealing the stone plate.</p><p>The stone plate was gray like a chaotic stone, and there were some strange runes carved on it.</p><p>At that moment, the runes all lit up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the stone plate vibrated and flew up, hovering above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mind was buzzing. He seemed to see a tall and sturdy figure controlling the array disc and fighting against the enemy.</p><p>“Primal Chaos Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. That figure was indeed the chaos Thearch.</p><p>This stone plate seemed to really be the weapon of the chaos Emperor.</p><p>“What a profound chaos law!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to sense an extremely mysterious and ancient law of chaos from the stone plate. It was many times faster than what he had comprehended.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have a deeper understanding of the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>During this period of cultivation, his comprehension of the chaotic laws had already reached 95%, but now, he felt that he was approaching 96%.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone disc continued to shake and the figure of the chaos Thearch disappeared. The stone disc began to shrink and finally fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Haha, it seems like I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Emperor formless laughed.</p><p>Sky Fire Emperor and huntian Emperor also smiled.</p><p>However, the smiles on the three great emperors ‘faces immediately disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, our original plan was to lead the Army and launch a general attack to attract the enemy’s attention. Then, the great emperors would suddenly charge in and kill their way to the void passageway. Then, we would seal the void passageway with the chaos stone disc!”</p><p>however, you also know that although the other party’s great emperors can’t enter, there are still many great emperors left here. Two of them were killed by the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, so there are still eight left. We’ve killed another one recently, so there are still seven of them. Therefore, it’s very dangerous to go. We won’t force you to go. If you don’t want to go, we’ll find another way!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>that’s right. Although we’ll try our best to protect you, the other party is a great emperor. There’s no guarantee that nothing will go wrong. So, you have to make your own decision!</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor followed.</p><p>After all, this matter was too dangerous. Lu Ming had to make his own decision.</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed without much consideration.</p><p>As a man, there were things he should do and things he shouldn’t!</p><p>How could he be afraid of death and refuse such a thing?</p><p>The three emperors nodded in satisfaction at Lu Ming’s determined gaze.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry. Even if we die, we’ll protect you!”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“If you die, we will die too!”</p><p>Huntian Emperor spoke for the first time, but his voice was firm and powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was very touched. As a great emperor, he was high and mighty. He could have forced Lu Ming to join forces. Lu Ming could only obey.</p><p>However, the other party did not. Instead, he asked for Lu Ming’s opinion.</p><p>He also promised that he would protect Lu Ming with his life.</p><p>As a great emperor, he could do this. Lu Ming admired his character.</p><p>“Great emperor, are there any other great emperors on our side?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course! 0then-vise, how could the three of us be a match for the evil god tribe?”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Realization dawned on Lu Ming. Indeed, it was only Emperor notionless and the other two. How could they be a match for the other party? moreover, they had even killed one of the other party’s people during this period of time.</p><p>There were other great emperors in the dark!</p><p>“I’ll take you to see him now!”</p><p>Notionless Emperor said. He then tore open space and brought Lu Ming back to the military camp. Then, he sent a message.</p><p>Not long after, the space fluctuated, and a figure stepped into it.</p><p>This figure was covered in a milky white light. It was the Holy Light. It was so dazzling that people couldn’t open their eyes.</p><p>Back then, the people from the Cang region’s tianshen sect also cultivated the divine light. However, compared to this, they were simply trash.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming knew that this was a great emperor, and his aura was not weaker than that of Emperor notionless and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is the Holy Emperor of the ancient Saint tribe!</p><p>Emperor formless introduced.</p><p>“Greetings, Holy Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed.</p><p>“The chaos stone plate has awakened?”</p><p>Said the Holy Emperor. His voice was cold, like a god high above.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Emperor formless nodded, and the Holy Emperor didn’t continue.</p><p>Then, there was a spatial fluctuation, and another person arrived.</p><p>This person was a great emperor from the ancient capital of Mount Yuan. He was like an unparalleled Emperor.</p><p>Just as the great emperor arrived, the void rippled and another figure descended.</p><p>“Uncle Kong!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but exclaim when he saw the figure.</p><p>This figure was actually uncle Kong.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that uncle Kong was indeed a great emperor.</p><p>Could it be that uncle Kong had been secretly participating in the battle this entire time?</p><p>“Greetings, senior dan Kong!”</p><p>When uncle Kong arrived, Emperor formless and the others all cupped their fists towards him and called him senior.</p><p>Even the cold and arrogant Holy Emperor and the Emperor-like Emperor saluted uncle Kong.</p><p>It seemed that uncle Kong’s seniority was high.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Uncle Kong nodded. He looked very old. His muddy eyes looked at Lu Ming and said,”I’ll escort Lu Ming in!”</p><p>we’re relieved that senior dan Kong is taking action. We’ll hold off the other great emperors!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Seniors, why don’t 1 see the Heng family and the he family’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to ask the Heng family, the he family, and the great emperors of the Daluo heaven sect. How could they be missing at this critical moment?</p><p>don’t mention those old foxes who are afraid of death. When there’s a big battle, they all hide and want to reap the benefits!</p><p>The Holy Emperor coldly snorted. He seemed to be very unhappy with the emperors from the he and Heng families..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
