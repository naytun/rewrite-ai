Naturally, he could not hide her cultivation from him.</p><p>The young woman was in the great circle of the bright Saint stage, which was much higher than the others. No wonder she was so confident.</p><p>Furthermore, Yan song’s subordinates had previously addressed her as Marshal tianjiao. It was likely that this woman’s identity here was not simple.</p><p>After the others left, the young lady’s eyes glowed as she stared at Lu Ming.”You really are a spy?”</p><p>“I’m not. I’ve already said that I’m just passing by and want to inquire about some things!”</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless. He spread his hands and explained again.</p><p>“I believe what you said!”</p><p>The young woman stared at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“You believe me just like that?”</p><p>This time, it was Lu Ming’s turn to be surprised.</p><p>“Because you’re very calm!”</p><p>The young woman said,” I’ve been paying attention to you since I came in. You were very calm when you faced Yan Song or me. Even when Yan Song said that he wanted to kill you, you were still very calm. It was as if you were not worried at all. It was as if you wanted to leave and could leave at any time. This was not an act. It was a reflection of your true state of mind.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose.</p><p>Indeed, he didn’t care about these people’s cultivation at all, so he was naturally very calm.</p><p>a person with such a mentality is definitely not an ordinary person. There’s another point. I’m cultivating the flood dragon combat body, but I can feel a strong pressure from you. Your spiritual body is definitely not ordinary!</p><p>The young woman’s eyes were very bright. She stared at Lu Ming as if she was trying to see through him.</p><p>“Just based on these two points, you’re sure that I’m not a spy? It doesn’t seem to be enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“My intuition tells me that these two points are enough!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Intuition?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“Yes, a woman’s intuition. Don’t you know that a woman’s intuition can be very accurate sometimes?”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He could not refute this.</p><p>It was unwise to discuss a woman’s intuition with a woman.</p><p>“That’s why I’m very curious. Who are you? Which country are you from?”</p><p>The young woman was still staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>I’ve said it before. I’m just passing by. In the past, I was cultivating on a deserted island. I’ve just been born!</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A glint flashed in the young woman’s eyes. Her figure suddenly moved. Like a Phantom, she rushed toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed and struck out a palm at him.</p><p>Of course, this speed was for ordinary people. To Lu Ming, it was no different from a snail.</p><p>Just as the young woman’s palm was about to hit Lu Ming, he raised his hand and ‘lightly’ slapped.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and the young woman’s palm collided. The young woman’s delicate body trembled and she drifted backward, but Lu Ming did not move an inch.</p><p>what a powerful cultivation. I can count on my fingers who have such a cultivation level in the vast sea nine nations at this age. I know every one of them, but I don’t know anyone like you. It seems that my intuition is right. I’m really curious now!</p><p>The young woman’s eyes were shining.</p><p>“Didn’t 1 already tell you? I’ve just been born, so you naturally don’t know me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, if that’s the case, why don’t you stay in the divine Dragon Army? I am the divine Dragon Army’s Marshal, ruan tianjiao!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Staying here? impossible! I won’t stay here for long. I’ll leave soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>He had entered this world to search for the celestial Thearch’s treasures. He couldn’t stay here for long.</p><p>there’s no need to stay here for a long time. A short time is fine. You can leave whenever you want. Besides, didn’t you want to inquire about information before? perhaps 1 can help you!</p><p>Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He pondered for a moment and said,”Alright, I’ll stay for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming indeed needed to find someone to gather some information. Ruan tianjiao seemed to have a lot of power here. As a general, he might be able to provide Lu Ming with a lot of help.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s face lit up. She had a feeling that Lu Ming was extraordinary.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>Ruan tian jiao asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“What do you want to ask?” Ruan tianjiao asked curiously.</p><p>“This … I want to know where we are.” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“This entire Island is a country, called the mingyan country!” Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“Then what about going further up? are there any other countries? how big is this world? Are there any ancient ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions in succession.</p><p>“You don’t even know this?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was very surprised.</p><p>haven’t I been in closed-door cultivation? 1 just came out! Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>there is an introduction to this world in this Jade token. Take a look!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao took out a Jade tablet and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He started to read the knowledge in the Jade card.</p><p>After reading it, Lu Ming had a general idea of what was going on.</p><p>It turned out that this world was called the realm of ten thousand seas, and most of its territory was the ocean.</p><p>However, there were also countless islands in the ocean.</p><p>Some of the islands were not big and were deserted, not suitable for humans to live on.</p><p>Some large islands were vast and suitable for humans to live and cultivate. There were countless martial artists living on them, forming their own countries.</p><p>The bright flame Island they were on was a big Island. The entire Island was a country called the bright flame country.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was one of the five great marshals of the mingyan country, the Marshal of the divine Dragon Army.</p><p>as for the ancient ruins you mentioned, there are indeed some in the vast sea realm. When 1 return to the capital, I’ll sort out the information on those ruins and give it to you. How about it? ”</p><p>Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“How long before you return to the capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>one month later. Don’t tell me you can’t even wait one month!</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>From the introduction just now, ten thousand sea realm was huge and had countless islands. It would be too difficult for him to search one by one, and he didn’t know how long it would take. With ruan tianjiao’s help, it would save him a lot of time.</p><p>“Come with me, I’ll arrange a tent for you. You can stay there first!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao then walked out of the tent with Lu Ming following behind.</p><p>When he walked out of the military tent, he saw Yan song’s group standing not far from the tent.</p><p>Everyone was stunned when they saw Lu Ming following ruan tianjiao out.</p><p>“Heavenserpent, how is it? Is this brat a spy? 1 suggest that we kill him immediately!”</p><p>Yan Song said.</p><p>you’re all wrong. He’s not a spy. I’ve already investigated it. You can all leave now!</p><p>Ruan tian jiao waved his hand.</p><p>“What? He’s not a spy. Tian Jiao, don’t be fooled by this man. i suggest that we cripple him first, and then slowly interrogate him. Men, take this kid down!”</p><p>Yan Song waved his hand and two half-Saints walked out from behind him. They were about to attack Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
