Then, the giant hammer hit the DA yan elixir furnace. The DA yan elixir furnace trembled and was also sent flying back.</p><p>“Men, help me kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted. Two Emperor-to-be rushed toward Lu Ming to cooperate with the middle-aged man.</p><p>With the cooperation of the two Emperor-to-be, the middle-aged man was even more unscrupulous. The giant hammer was the size of a house and it kept smashing toward Lu Ming with an amazing momentum.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with the Dayan elixir furnace, which kept retreating.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu…</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying whistling sound came from behind Lu Ming. A huge, pitch-black Vortex was slowly moving toward him.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re dead!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was overjoyed.</p><p>Even the heavens wanted Lu Ming to die. At this moment, a Black Vortex moved over, leaving Lu Ming no room to retreat.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Bubbles shouted and wanted to help but the three monarch weapons had locked down three directions. The other quasi sages were bombarding her. Although bubbles ‘spacetime law was profound, the opponent was using a brutal method to disrupt the void. Bubbles could only protect herself and couldn’t help.</p><p>At that moment, a pair of cold eyes were staring at Lu Ming from behind the black Vortex.</p><p>This man was actually Luo cangqiong.</p><p>In fact, Luo cangqiong was with Luo pokong and the others. It was just that he had been cultivating alone in the void before, so Lu Ming did not notice him.</p><p>He heard the commotion and rushed over. He did not expect to see Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; he hid behind the pitch-black Vortex and used the law of deprivation to condense the divine imprint of deprivation, constantly draining the energy in the air.</p><p>The more time passed, the more energy was stripped away, and the more powerful the power of the divine seal would be.</p><p>By now, the power of the divine seal had reached a terrifying level. Even Luo cangqiong himself was shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll use this move to send you on your way!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s eyes flashed with ferocity. When he saw an opening when Lu Ming was suppressed by the middle-aged man and the two Emperor-to-be, Luo cangqiong did not hesitate to flash out. The divine seal of deprivation flew out rapidly and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. The power of the deprivation divine seal was too shocking. It even surpassed the middle-aged man’s attack by a large margin.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming was resisting the attacks of the middle-aged man and the other two Emperor-to-be with all his might. He did not expect that Luo cangqiong would suddenly attack from behind the vortex. It was too late for him to Dodge.</p><p>Qiu Yue had first entered Yellow Rock world. After exploring a few of the ruins of this world, she also came to the edge of Yellow Rock world and entered the void turbulence, wanting to head to another world to explore.</p><p>She cultivated in the void turbulence as she walked. After walking for a few days, she suddenly heard a violent boom from ahead.</p><p>Qiu Yue retracted her aura and walked forward. She saw Lu Ming fighting with someone.</p><p>Just as she was about to help, she saw that Luo cangqiong had suddenly attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue pounced forward without any hesitation.</p><p>“Young master, be careful!”</p><p>A crisp sound rang in Lu Ming’s ears. Then, he saw a white figure rushing from the side at high speed toward the divine seal of deprivation.</p><p>“Qiuyue…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Then, he heard a loud boom. Qiu Yue’s body flew towards Lu Ming. In the air, her blood was red, like a beautiful blood-colored rose.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming roared loudly, his eyes red.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s move was too powerful. Lu Ming knew very well that Qiu Yue would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar and controlled the Dayan elixir furnace with all his might to block the attacks of the middle-aged man and the two Emperor-to-be. He moved his body and caught Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue’s face was as white as snow. Blood was flowing out of her mouth and she was extremely weak.</p><p>It was like a weak candle that could be extinguished at any moment.</p><p>“Qiuyue, it’s you. How is that possible?”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared in disbelief.</p><p>Why did Qiu Yue suddenly appear and block his sure-kill move?</p><p>He was stunned for a moment and forgot to attack.</p><p>The middle-aged man also knew that Luo cangqiong had been pursuing Qiu Yue. When he saw this scene, he couldn’t help but stop.</p><p>“Qiuyue, why are you so stupid? why did you block for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming hugged Qiu Yue, his heart trembling.</p><p>With his cultivation and the strength of his body, even if he were to take a blow head-on, he would at most be heavily injured and might not die. However, it was a different story for Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Young … Young master! Young master, I’ve said before that I’ll always be by your side…”</p><p>Qiu Yue spoke, but her voice was weak. Her aura was also getting weaker.</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and Saint energy flowed into her body continuously, protecting her heart.</p><p>However, it was still useless. Qiu Yue’s breath became weaker and weaker, and her eyes slowly closed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand Qiu Yue over to me. Even if she dies, she’ll still be mine!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said coldly.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked at Luo cangqiong with bloodshot eyes. His body was filled with an extremely cold killing intent, like a demon from the nine netherworlds purgatory.</p><p>1’11 definitely kill you, and 1’11 flatten the Daluo heaven sect sooner or later!</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold and emotionless voice.</p><p>Luo cangqiong felt a chill run down his spine when Lu Ming stared at him coldly. He roared,”If you still want to kill me, then I’ll let you both die Here today as a pair of mandarin ducks sharing the same fate!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out of Luo cangqiong’s body, and a monarch weapon appeared.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was the grandson of the great sovereign, and the monarch weapon he had was given by the great sovereign. It was extremely terrifying. “Let’s attack together and kill them!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared. The sovereign weapon carried a terrifying power and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the middle-aged man made his move. His giant hammer broke through the air and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, I will definitely kill you in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. With a single thought, the Dayan elixir furnace did not protect him but blasted towards the bubble.</p><p>As for himself, he recalled Qiu Yue into the mountain and river diagram with a thought. At the same time, Lu Ming used the Tai Chi formation disk and the chaos gem to block in front of him. He retreated quickly and rushed toward the Black Vortex.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation plate was sent flying back by the middle-aged man while the rock of chaos flew toward Lu Ming after being hit by Luo cangqiong’s monarch weapon.</p><p>The terrifying power increased Lu Ming’s speed and he flew directly into the black Vortex.</p><p>At once, an extremely powerful force acted on Lu Ming’s body. His figure disappeared into the vortex.</p><p>On the other side, the DA yan elixir furnace smashed down and sent one of the monarch weapons that trapped bubbles flying. In a flash, bubbles charged out of the encirclement and into the pitch-black Vortex.</p><p>“Stop that pill furnace!”</p><p>Someone shouted and wanted to stop the great Yan elixir furnace. However, the great Yan elixir furnace had long recognized Lu Ming as its master and was very intelligent. It blew away a few Emperor-to-be and rushed into the dark vortex, disappearing..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
