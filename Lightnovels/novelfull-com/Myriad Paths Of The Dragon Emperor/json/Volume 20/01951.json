I’ve never heard of a giant wolf becoming a Sage Emperor on the divine time Island!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>The people from the vast sea nine nations turned pale. There were so many sacred emperors against Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Xuan Chuan, he was overjoyed and shouted,” quickly send the signal and gather the experts of the divine Island!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Beside Xuan Chuan, an expert waved his hand and a light pillar shot up into the sky, forming a river of time. Everyone on the entire divine time Island could see it.</p><p>Xuan Chuan’s words shocked everyone.</p><p>From Xuan Chuan’s words, these divine emperors weren’t from the time God Island.</p><p>However, other than the temporal Island, there were no other factions in the ten thousand sea realm that had Saint emperors. And three of them had appeared all at once.</p><p>Gah! OWW!</p><p>At this moment, a few sharp bird calls were heard.</p><p>A huge three-legged golden Crow appeared in the sky.</p><p>In addition, there was a huge Silver Wolf, all of which were Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Many experts from the major forces had entered the world of the lotus flower. Naturally, there were more than one or two Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>that’s the three-legged golden Crow, the legendary divine beast!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the ten thousand seas realm, the three-legged golden Crow was a legendary divine beast. It had never appeared before. Today, he had actually seen one.</p><p>“Hehe, this is Lu Ming?”</p><p>A cold voice came from a gust of wind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve been hiding for so long. You’ll die today. Hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword!”</p><p>Another voice was heard from the other side.</p><p>“The Heng family!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with intense killing intent.</p><p>It seemed that almost all the enemies were here today.</p><p>At this time, regardless of whether it was the people from the vast sea nine nations, the mysterious spirit Kingdom, or the other countries, they were all stunned. They all gasped in shock.</p><p>Nine divine emperors!</p><p>A total of nine divine emperors surrounded Lu Ming. They were all hostile to him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Kuan tianjiao’s eyes were filled with deep worry.</p><p>At this moment, several figures flew over from the divine time Island. All of them had powerful auras.</p><p>The experts of the divine time Island had arrived.</p><p>“Xuan Chuan, what happened?”</p><p>An old man asked. He looked at the quasi sages of the Golden Crow race with a serious expression.</p><p>it’s this brat! He’s the one who killed the people of our divine time Island! He’s absolutely lawless!</p><p>Xuan Chuan pointed at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>you dare to kill the people of our divine time Island? what guts!</p><p>The old man shouted coldly. He and the other two powerhouses stepped toward Lu Ming. The river of laws also appeared on their bodies.</p><p>The sage Emperor, another Sage Emperor!</p><p>A total of twelve sacred emperors surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, this brat actually has so many enemies. He’s dead for sure!</p><p>Xuan Chuan laughed in his heart.</p><p>As for the people from the smaller countries, their minds were in a complete mess. Everything that happened today was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Other than the divine time Island, where did so many Sage emperors come from?</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword!”</p><p>The Heng family’s Saint Emperor shouted coldly.</p><p>“If you want it, come and get it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The Saint energy in his body circulated crazily, pushing his strength to the limit.</p><p>It seemed that he had to fight a big battle today.</p><p>young master Xing lie once said that he would kill you with his own hands. But today, I will do it!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng family spoke coldly and was the first to make a move. A pale sword radiance bloomed and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s body, hundreds of acupuncture points lit up. Hundreds of holy weapons flew out, and the Qi of combat weapons soared into the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The holy sword of supremacy flew toward the sword-light of the Heng family’s Emperor-to-be with a single thought from Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword trembled and was sent flying back, but it still managed to block the opponent s sword.</p><p>Lu Ming is cunning and sinister. There’s no need to play by the rules with him. Let’s attack together!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the WAN family shouted and made his move. Endless Qi of war weapons gathered and slashed out a vast sword light, aiming at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>This time, in the world of the lotus flower, it was a rare opportunity to lull Lu Ming.</p><p>If he left the world of the lotus flower, it would be difficult to lull Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, if they were to send out even more powerful experts, it was likely that the great Yan elixir Palace’s uncle Kong would make a move.</p><p>He had been killed while searching for treasures in the Lotus World, so uncle Kong had nothing to say.</p><p>if you want to join forces, just say it. There’s no need to be so Grand!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and threw a punch. A Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and flew toward the Emperor-to-be of the WAN family.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled, and with the power to suppress the heavens, it struck the battle weapon of the quasi-Emperor of the WAN clan, forcing him to retreat a few steps.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A roar was heard. The two Emperor-to-be giant wolves from the Skywolf tower also made their move. They howled madly and suppressed the sky. They launched a terrifying killing force at Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, the Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow race, the</p><p>Emperor-to-be of the purple Extreme sect, and the Emperor-to-be of the wind race made their moves at the same time.</p><p>The nine emperors-to-be attacked at the same time. Their auras were so powerful that it seemed like they could blow up the world.</p><p>The endless pressure forced the spectators to retreat.</p><p>The people from the vast sea nine nations and the mysterious spirit Kingdom retreated frantically. The pressure was too strong, and they were too close to it. They were afraid that they would be crushed.</p><p>“Is this the strength of a Saint Emperor? The moment he makes a move, he has earth-shattering power. It’s too terrifying!”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>Then, they looked at the figure who was besieged by many emperors-to-be.</p><p>Could he still block so many attacks?</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. The space between his eyebrows glowed and the Dayan elixir furnace appeared. It grew rapidly and blasted behind him.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the same time, he used the primal Chaos tribulation finger and thrust five fingers forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The five huge fingers, like the fingers of a God, broke through the air and attacked the five Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>With continuous rumbles, the five chaos fingers of tribulation exploded, but they also blocked the other party’s attack.</p><p>Behind him, the Dayan elixir furnace had also blocked the attacks of the other four. It trembled and flew back to Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and his face turned pale.</p><p>He was powerful and could defeat or even kill any of the nine emperors-to-be.</p><p>However, if all nine of them attacked him at the same time, he would not be able to do so.</p><p>After all, there were nine of them, and he was no match for them. His body trembled and his qi and blood churned.</p><p>However, this scene, in the eyes of others, was nothing but shock.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The people of xuanling Kingdom and Xuan Chuan widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to block the attacks of nine Saint emperors by himself.. What kind of monster was he?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
