The one in the lead was a young man in golden robes.</p><p>“Big brother!”</p><p>The tall young man from xuanling Kingdom was overjoyed to see this young man.</p><p>His big brother had finally arrived.</p><p>His big brother had come to the God time Island six years ago. With his shocking talent, he was accepted as a disciple by a Saint Emperor of the God time Island. Right now, his status on the God time Island was extraordinary.</p><p>His big brother’s arrival finally put him at ease.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Seeing this youth, ruan tianjiao’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming, this person is wearing a golden robe with a river of time embroidered on the cuffs. This is the symbol of a core disciple of the divine time Island!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>The core disciple of the divine time Island was the highest level of cultivation in the divine time Island. There were only a few of them in the entire divine time Island, and their status was astonishing.</p><p>This young man was obviously from the mysterious spirit Kingdom. This time, they were in trouble.</p><p>Xuan Chuan was the young man’s name.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Chuan was extremely angry and filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>Today, he had just come out of seclusion and wanted to see the people from the mysterious spirit Kingdom. His brother had come as well, but he did not expect to see Lu Ming killing the experts from the mysterious spirit Kingdom the moment he arrived.</p><p>Even the mysterious spirit Kingdom couldn’t afford to lose more than ten absolute Saints. This was definitely more than half of the experts in the mysterious spirit Kingdom.</p><p>“Boy, I’ll let you die without a burial place. And all of you from the vast sea nine nationswill die!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan glared at Lu Ming coldly, wishing he could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>it’s your people from the mysterious spirit Kingdom who occupied the palace we live in. It’s also your country who attacked us first. How can we not retaliate?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao called out.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan shouted coldly, his eyes cold.”So what? Even if 1 occupy your Palace, even if I want to kill you first, so what? You shouldn’t have retaliated. If you retaliated, you would have died!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan was overbearing.</p><p>They didn’t care about the cause and process. He only cared about the result.</p><p>In the end, the powerhouses of the mysterious spirit Kingdom were killed. Lu Ming and the rest had to die.</p><p>“Big brother, you must take revenge for the elders!”</p><p>The tall young man shouted.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan spoke coldly, the vastsea nine nations are lawless. They openly killed experts of other countries on the temporal divine Island. They are all sentenced to death. Kill without mercy!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A few people walked out from behind Xuan Chuan, releasing a terrifying aura.</p><p>These people were all absolute Saints in the great circle.</p><p>These people were all experts from the divine time Island. Their faces were cold, and they didn’t care about who was right or wrong.</p><p>If Xuan Chuan said to kill, they would kill!</p><p>Xuan Chuan’s status on the divine time Island was transcendent and he was loved by many divine emperors. His words were law and reason!</p><p>The faces of the vast sea nine nations, including ruan tianjiao, were extremely ugly.</p><p>The divine time Island was different from the other great nations. They were the number one power in the ten thousand sea realm and had unfathomable strength. They had many sacred emperors. If they offended the divine time Island, the vast sea nine nations would be eliminated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>He himself was not afraid, but he was worried that he would implicate the nine nations of the vast sea.</p><p>“Kneel down and accept your punishment!”</p><p>An absolute Saint in the great circle said coldly. He slammed his palm down, and a huge palm formed and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the huge palm was crushed.</p><p>Xuan Chuan’s eyes narrowed. Lu Ming was so powerful. He could even block an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>“Could this person also be from beyond the heavens?”</p><p>Xuan Chuan’s heart moved.</p><p>With his status, he naturally knew many things that others didn’t. During this period of time, many experts from the ten thousand sea realm had suddenly descended. All of them had profound cultivation and powerful battle prowess. Many of them were actually not weaker than the sacred emperors of the divine time Island.</p><p>He had heard from some elders that these people might have come from beyond the heavens.</p><p>In the beginning, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>If Lu Ming was also from beyond the heavens, things would not be easy.</p><p>Xuan Chuan frowned.</p><p>“The people of my mysterious spirit Kingdom can’t die in vain!”</p><p>Suddenly, Xuan Chuan clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>So what if he came from beyond the heavens? How could his divine time Island be afraid?</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the few absolute Saints in the great circle charged toward Lu Ming again. They were all using killing moves.</p><p>“You’re the ones who are looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Just now, he had already taken a step back and did not fight back. However, the other party was obviously insatiable.</p><p>He understood that there was no use in backing down against such a person. Only by using iron and blood to suppress him would the other party be afraid. Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and flew up. He threw a punch and the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele appeared, suppressing an absolute Saint in the perfection.</p><p>That expert’s attack was instantly destroyed by the prison-suppressing stele’s illusionary image. Under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele, the man screamed in pain and his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming punched again and killed a person in the absolute saint’s perfection.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Xuan Chuan roared. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. He could even kill an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>The tall young man and the rest of the people from xuanling Kingdom were also pale.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was simply a god of death.</p><p>send the signal, send the signal. Gather the experts of the divine Island!</p><p>Xuan Chuan retreated crazily and shouted at the same time.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void and charged towards Xuan Chuan. Since he had made his move, he would destroy them all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you. Kill!”</p><p>Right at this moment, an explosive roar rang out. Following that, a terrifying sword light came slashing over from the distance. It was extremely terrifying, as though it was going to split the entire divine time Island in half.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. An absolute holy weapon sword appeared in his hand and he swung it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent explosion, along with endless sword Qi, spread out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the distance, there was a flash of light and a middle-aged man appeared in the sky.</p><p>Spots of light lit up on his body. Hundreds of holy weapons floated around him, and a River of laws surrounded him.</p><p>“The WAN family!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>It seemed that many experts who had entered the ten-thousand sea realm had come to the divine time Island, just like him, to explore the divine time mountain.</p><p>“The river of laws, that’s … Saint Emperor!”</p><p>“Heavens, the sage Emperor has appeared!”</p><p>“Could it be the divine Emperor of the divine time Island?”</p><p>Cries of alarm rang out.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was known as a Sacred Emperor in the ten thousand sea realm. They were the strongest experts in the realm.</p><p>Because there were no martial emperors in the ten thousand sea realm, and immortality was only a legend.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao and the others were also extremely shocked.</p><p>The sacred Emperor had made his move. Could Lu Ming win?</p><p>OWW!</p><p>At this moment, a heaven-shaking roar was heard. In the distance, a giant wolf as large as a mountain stepped through the air.</p><p>This giant wolf was also surrounded by a River of laws.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, on the other side, a purple light flashed, and a purple-robed elder appeared. His body was covered in purple light, and there was also a River of laws around him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
