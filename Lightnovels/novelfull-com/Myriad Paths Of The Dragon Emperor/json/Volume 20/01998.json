If we can’t even win this small-scale battle, how are we going to fight in the future? how are we going to fight the final battle? how are we going to annihilate the evil god tribe?”</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice suddenly rose in pitch, and his aura grew stronger and stronger, as if he was a Tiger that could swallow the world.</p><p>Many people clenched their fists tightly.</p><p>“Are you guys willing to chase after us and win this battle? Annihilate the evil god tribe and protect your family, your loved ones, and your friends?”</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice grew louder and louder, filled with an indomitable will.</p><p>“I’m willing, I’m willing!”</p><p>Many people roared, their voices shaking the firmament.</p><p>Especially some young people, their blood was boiling.</p><p>Wasn’t it just the evil god tribe? it was just a battle. In order to protect what he wanted to protect, so what if he died in battle?</p><p>alright. Next, we’ll split into three armies led by the three of us. We’ll form a triangular formation and completely annihilate the evil god tribe!</p><p>Emperor formless announced.</p><p>After that, all the experts were divided into three armies, led by three great emperors.</p><p>All the forces of ancient Moon Holy Land followed Emperor formless.</p><p>A day later, the Army set off and charged towards the evil god tribe.</p><p>Of course, the martial sovereigns on their side would deal with the Emperor-level powerhouses on the other side, and those below the martial sovereign level would deal with those below the martial sovereign level.</p><p>In this battle, they had almost wiped out the evil god tribe’s Army in the northern part of the Mount Yuan sacred land.</p><p>After that, the evil god tribe mobilized their armies from a few other directions. There were also armies from the heavenly Emperor City that came over. Both sides started a fierce battle in the North of the yuan mountain.</p><p>This battle became a stalemate that lasted for half a year.</p><p>For the past half a year, Lu Ming and the rest had been in constant battles, tempering themselves at all times. They often walked on the edge of life and death.</p><p>To them, their improvement was extremely fast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the absolute Saint realm and was slowly approaching the perfected absolute Saint realm. His combat strength was even more shocking. An ordinary Emperor-to-be would not even be left with a single punch.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Huang Li had also made great progress. All of them had entered the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Luo Tianyi had even successfully cultivated the light of law.</p><p>As for Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others, they had also touched the edge of the light of law.</p><p>As long as one didn’t die, the results of training in a life-and-death situation would be shocking.</p><p>If they were to cultivate normally, they would not be able to break through without a few years.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang had improved the fastest. Not only had she entered the great saint perfection early on, but she had also stimulated her potential during a great battle and broken through her limit in one fell swoop, entering the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Even Lu Ming was very envious of this speed.</p><p>However, after entering the absolute Saint realm, Xiangxiang Bella’s cultivation speed had also slowed down.</p><p>In the past six months, Lu Ming had brought Ouyang Moli, Xue ningxin, Tian Chui, and a few others to participate in the battles. They had all made great progress.</p><p>Ouyang Moli had the reincarnation body. In addition to the world core of the reincarnation Emperor, his cultivation speed was even more terrifying. It was as if he was riding a rocket. It was only a matter of time before he caught up to Xiangxiang Bella.</p><p>In the past half a year, Lu Ming had killed countless three-eyed God race experts and obtained countless resources. These resources were all converted into energy and absorbed by the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>The energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had finally reached nine percent, not far from ten percent.</p><p>After half a year of intense battle, they had gained the upper hand in all aspects. They had taken back all the land that the evil god tribe had occupied and started to attack the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>However, the evil god tribe had set up layers of defenses in the heavenly Emperor City by relying on the city walls.</p><p>After many battles, even though they had killed countless evil god tribe members, the evil god tribe was always able to replenish their numbers in an endless stream.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming had just returned to the military camp after killing for a while. An elder came to look for him.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized this elder. He was a teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>“The three great emperors want to see me?”</p><p>When the teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy stated his purpose for coming, Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>What did the three great emperors want to see him for?</p><p>Lu Ming did not ask much. He followed the teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Institute and arrived at a military tent.</p><p>In the tent, the three great emperors sat together and seemed to be discussing something.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re here!”</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, Emperor formless smiled.</p><p>“Greetings to the three great emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and the teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m looking for you because I need your help!”</p><p>Emperor formless laughed.</p><p>“You need my help?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more confused. Why did the great emperor ask him for help? If even the great emperor couldn’t handle it, there was no use looking for him.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve seen the battle during this period of time. Although we have the upper hand and have been killing the evil god tribe continuously, the evil god tribe has always been able to replenish their numbers. It’s all because of that void passageway!</p><p>as long as we have that void passageway, we won’t be able to completely annihilate the evil god tribe. We can only form a stalemate and the yuan mountain will never be able to settle down!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Of the three great emperors, Emperor notionless was the most eloquent, so he was the one who usually spoke up.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, the void passageway was the foundation. As long as the void passageway existed, they would not be able to annihilate the evil god tribe completely.</p><p>But what did this have to do with him? With his current cultivation, he couldn’t be of much help at all.</p><p>if we want to defeat the evil god tribe, we’ll have to seal that void passageway. We’ll need your help, Lu Ming!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Great emperor, please feel free to ask. As long as Lu Ming can help, 1 will definitely not decline!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll take you to a place!”</p><p>Notionless Emperor nodded. With a wave of his hand, a surge of energy enveloped Lu Ming. Space cracked open, and the three emperors disappeared from the military tent with Lu Ming.</p><p>The next moment, they arrived at a Valley.</p><p>He did not know where this Valley was, but it seemed to be very well hidden. There was a powerful force in the air.</p><p>After coming here, Lu Ming felt an inexplicable throbbing as if something was attracting him.</p><p>The few of them walked forward and came to a concave land.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a huge stone plate on the ground in front of him. It was round and looked like a formation plate. It looked very ancient and was filled with the aura of time.</p><p>The stone plate was embedded in the ground. No, it should be said that the stone plate fell from the sky and smashed into the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that the thing that attracted him was this stone tray.</p><p>“This stone plate has the aura of the Laws of Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but say.</p><p>you’ve sensed it. Yes, this stone plate does have the aura of the chaos laws. We speculate that this stone plate is likely to be the weapon used by one of the most powerful experts in the heaven realm, the chaos Thearch, in the ancient times!</p><p>The sky Fire monarch spoke with a deep voice, the weapon of the chaos Thearch!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
