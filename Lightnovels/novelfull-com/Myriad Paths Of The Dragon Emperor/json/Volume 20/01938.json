The terrifying force of his palm smashed the table into pieces.</p><p>“Damned b * tch!”</p><p>Yan Song bellowed. His face was incomparably malevolent and filled with killing intent.</p><p>During this period of time, every time he looked for ruan tianjiao, he would be stopped by ruan tianjiao’s subordinates. They said that ruan tianjiao had to focus on training the Army and had no time.</p><p>However, the news he received was that ruan tianjiao was always hanging out with Lu Ming.</p><p>young master, it seems like ruan tianjiao has been bewitched by Lu Ming. 1 wonder what kind of drug that kid has given ruan tianjiao? ”</p><p>that’s right. It’s all because of Lu Ming. When I first saw him, I knew that he wasn’t a good person. If not for that kid, ruan tianjiao might have already fallen into the young master’s arms!</p><p>A few of Yan song’s subordinates added fuel to the fire, causing Yan Song to become even angrier. His killing intent was like a knife.</p><p>“That brat must die!”</p><p>Yan Song coldly spoke and continued,” “I told you to keep an eye on that kid. Where is he now?”</p><p>“Young master, we just received news that the brat has returned to the camp!” One of them answered.</p><p>very good. Let’s go. I want this kid to die a miserable death!</p><p>A sinister look appeared in Yan song’s eyes. He led a few of his subordinates and walked towards Lu Ming’s tent.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating in the military tent when a loud roar suddenly came from outside.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>A voice filled with murderous intent was heard, causing Lu Ming to frown.</p><p>He knew it was Yan song’s voice the moment he heard it.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He got up and walked out of the tent.</p><p>He saw Yan Song and a few of his subordinates looking at Lu Ming with a cold expression.</p><p>Around the military tent, some members of the divine Dragon Army were alarmed and gathered around to watch. However, Yan song’s status was no small matter, so no one dared to come over and speak.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a faint glance at him.</p><p>“Brat, I’ve already given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Now, you even dare to snatch my woman. You really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>Yan Song said coldly.</p><p>“You’re giving me a chance?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but shake his head. Who would give who a chance then? “You lowly dog, why don’t you take a piss and see who you are? how dare you go against me? a dog like you should kneel in front of me and beg for mercy. Do you understand? kill him!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted and waved his hand.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two half-Saint Martial artists stepped out. Their powerful auras burst out and they were about to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>stop, young master Yan. Lu Ming is the general’s friend. If the general finds out that you’re treating Lu Ming like this, I’m afraid you won’t be able to answer to him!</p><p>At this moment, a burly man rushed over and shouted. He was a Deputy general of the divine Dragon Army. During this period of time, he had become quite familiar with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted angrily and slapped the burly man. The burly man did not dare to resist and was slapped in the face. He staggered and retreated.</p><p>Who Do You Think You Are? I don’t need you to criticize me. If you say any more nonsense, I’ll kill you as well!</p><p>Yan song’s cold gaze swept across the burly man, causing him to turn pale, this is bad. Yan Song wants to kill Lu Ming. Quickly inform the Marshal!</p><p>In the surroundings, some people muttered. After that, some people quickly left to inform ruan tianjiao.</p><p>“I’ll make you pay for this slap ten times over!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yan Song, his expression turning cold.</p><p>haha, you’re talking big. Let’s do it!</p><p>Yan Song laughed heartily.</p><p>“Kid, kneel down first!”</p><p>The two half-Saints charged at Lu Ming from both sides. They waved their hands at Lu Ming, intending to make him kneel in front of Yan Song before killing him.</p><p>“Since you like to kneel, then … Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the soul illusion on the last word.</p><p>At this moment, in the eyes of the two half-Saints, Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a demonic god who ruled the world and had the power to kill. The two of them were almost scared out of their wits by the terrifying aura.</p><p>The two of them seemed to have lost control of their bodies. They knelt down in front of Lu Ming with a plop.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yan Song was dumbfounded. His two other subordinates were also dumbfounded.</p><p>The surrounding Divine Dragon Army soldiers were also stunned.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why were Yan song’s two half-Saint subordinates suddenly kneeling in front of Lu Ming?</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he did not do anything at all. He only said softly,”kneel down.” These were two half-Saints, the closest to being a saint?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was a Saint?</p><p>Everyone secretly guessed.</p><p>it seems that your two subordinates know that they were wrong and are kneeling down to beg for mercy. If you don’t kneel down, 1 might consider sparing you!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yan Song indifferently.</p><p>“You dog, you actually dare to fight back. You are indeed a spy. Attack and kill him!”</p><p>Yan Song reacted, and the anger in his heart soared to the sky as he roared loudly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Beside Yan Song, an old man stepped out, and a terrifying aura bloomed.</p><p>The old man was a lower tier bright Saint and was a well-known top master in the country.</p><p>The old man’s aura bloomed, causing many people’s faces to change.</p><p>This was a Saint, a top cultivator of mingyan country. A half-Saint couldn’t compare to him.</p><p>“Why isn’t the Marshal here yet?”</p><p>Some people were anxious and worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had made the two half-Saints kneel down, the difference between the Saint realm and the half-Saint realm was too great.</p><p>The old man’s aura grew stronger and stronger, pressing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still standing there, motionless, as if he did not see the old man.</p><p>“Deliberately mystifying, die for this old man!”</p><p>The old man’s eyes were filled with ferocity. His claws were like blades as he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke again. His voice was not loud, but when it fell into the old man’s ears, it sounded like thunder. It was as if a God was shouting in his ear.</p><p>At this moment, his soul was under a terrifying pressure. He couldn’t use any power in his body.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Just like the two half-Saints, he knelt down in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The entire place fell silent. At this moment, time and space seemed to have frozen.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. They looked at Lu Ming coldly and then at the old man.</p><p>A Saint actually knelt down in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>A moment ago, he was filled with killing intent and wanted to kill Lu Ming. The next moment, he knelt in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Many people realized that their brains were already unable to process this. They had never seen such a thing before.</p><p>A Saint realm expert didn’t even fight and directly knelt down. What kind of trick was this?</p><p>Yan Song was also stunned. His mouth was so wide open that he could swallow a dead rat. His throat seemed to be stuck by something, and he could not make a sound for a long time.</p><p>it seems that your subordinates are very sensible. They have recognized their mistakes and knelt down to admit their mistakes. Now, why don’t you kneel down?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yan Song and spoke indifferently..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
