His expression was grave, but he was also filled with anticipation.</p><p>At this moment, the space above Lu Ming and the others fluctuated and a figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others were shocked. This person was Emperor Wu Xiang of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The teachers and students of the yuan mountain sacred Academy were just about to bow when Emperor Wu Xiang waved his hand, indicating that there was no need to bow.</p><p>At this moment, the figure in the sky was becoming more and more corporeal, and everyone was shocked.</p><p>Could it be that the celestial Thearch was about to be resurrected? Or was this just a mark left by the heavenly Emperor when he was in seclusion?</p><p>Everyone guessed that today’s matter had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as the heavenly Emperor apparition had condensed to the extreme, his figure suddenly flew towards the heavenly Emperor mountain. He entered the mountain and disappeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, with a shocking boom, the entire heavenly Emperor mountain exploded.</p><p>The majestic heavenly Emperor mountain exploded. Then, a light beam shot out from below the heavenly Emperor mountain and pierced through the sky.</p><p>“That is …A flower!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>At the foot of the heavenly Emperor mountain, a beam of light shot into the sky. Between the light beam, a flower emerged.</p><p>This flower did not look like it had bloomed yet. It was only in the shape of a bud and looked like a lotus.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. What was going on?</p><p>“This flower is just an illusion, not a real entity!”</p><p>look, there’s a cave down there. It keeps going down!</p><p>The strange movements at the heavenly Emperor mountain had caused a clamor in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on it. Indeed, the flower in the sky was not a real entity. It was more like a projection.</p><p>Originally, there was a cave under the heavenly Emperor mountain. That light pillar had shot out from this cave.</p><p>Could it be that there was some treasure in that cave?</p><p>The heavenly Emperor mountain had always been suppressing this treasure?</p><p>At the thought of this, many people’s eyes burned with passion.</p><p>If it was a treasure, even the celestial Thearch would value it. Even the Emperor couldn’t remain calm.</p><p>In a flash, the great emperors of the Heng family, the Daluo heaven sect, the he family, and the formless Emperor appeared in the sky above the cave at the same time.</p><p>The great emperor of the Heng clan glanced at the great emperor of the he clan coldly but didn’t say anything.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor mountain had exploded. Without the suppression of the heavenly Emperor mountain, he knew that he could not kill the great emperor of the he clan.</p><p>The four great emperors looked down at the cave below, and their faces were filled with shock.</p><p>The others couldn’t help but feel an itch in their hearts. Even the great emperor revealed a surprised expression. What exactly was at the bottom of the cave?</p><p>Everyone wanted to go and take a look personally, but the great emperor was there, so no one dared to go.</p><p>If they angered the Emperor, only death awaited them.</p><p>this is the world left behind by the celestial Emperor. It should belong to my Heng family. Please leave!</p><p>The Heng clan’s gaze swept across the great emperors of the he clan and Emperor formless.</p><p>“What a joke. We don’t even know if this was left behind by the heavenly Emperor. Even if it was left behind by the heavenly Emperor, what does it have to do with your Heng family? Don’t say that you’re a descendant of the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan sneered.</p><p>“What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>Emperor Heng’s eyes were cold.</p><p>it’s simple. The Heng family can’t take over this place!</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan said coldly. He then turned to Emperor formless.”Wuxiang, what do you think?”</p><p>the heavenly Emperor has been dead for countless years. So many years have passed, and nothing can be explained clearly. Therefore, the things left behind by the heavenly Emperor should only be known to those who are fated!</p><p>Emperor formless said.</p><p>What he meant was simple. The heavenly Emperor had fallen for so many years, so who could say for sure if the Heng family was the descendant of the heavenly Emperor?</p><p>After so long, the treasures of the celestial Thearch should be known to those who were fated.</p><p>The Emperor from the Heng family had an unsightly expression on his face, but even with the help of the Daluo heaven sect’s Emperor, he couldn’t do anything to the two emperors.</p><p>What’s more, the yuan mountain sacred Academy was established by three great emperors. Now that the other great emperor had yet to appear, this made him very afraid.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to rely on my own abilities!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family said coldly. Then, he suddenly rushed down into the cave.</p><p>The great emperors of the Daluo heaven sect, the great emperors of the he family, and the great emperors of the formless heaven sect all rushed down into the cave at the same time and disappeared.</p><p>The others looked at each other, but they didn’t dare to follow the four great emperors. They could only wait with their eyes wide open.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a violent roar came from the underground cave. There seemed to be endless gales blowing over there. The light pillar that rushed out was even more dazzling.</p><p>Then, the four figures rushed out of the cave. No, they didn’t seem to have rushed out by themselves. They seemed to have been blown out by the wind.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. What was in the cave that could ‘blow’ out great emperors? and there were four of them? this was too terrifying.</p><p>The four Emperors stood in the sky with dark expressions.</p><p>After a while, the Emperor of the Heng clan seemed to be unwilling to give up and rushed down again. However, he was still blasted out after a while.</p><p>“You, go down and take a look!”</p><p>The great emperor of the Heng family pointed at a true Emperor expert of the Heng family.</p><p>“You, go together!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan looked at one of the true emperors of the he clan, Emperor formless, and called out to another true Emperor expert of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The three true emperors flew forward and charged into the cave. However, not long after, the three true Emperor experts were blasted out by a force just like the four great emperors from before.</p><p>Following that, a few great emperors called for the void Emperor of the small emperor throne, but they were still blasted out.</p><p>Then, he called a few more emperors-to-be to go down. But this time, they weren’t blasted out. Instead, they blocked the power from below.</p><p>It seemed that the power in the cave would change according to the cultivation of the person who went down.</p><p>The stronger one’s cultivation was, the stronger the power in the cave would be.</p><p>“What is in the cave? Why do the great emperors value him so much?”</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but wonder.</p><p>Your Majesty, there seems to be a force down there blocking us. We can’t get in! the elder said.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the Heng clan reported to the great emperor. Everyone perked up their ears to listen.</p><p>this lotus flower has nine petals, and each petal represents a world. The lotus flower hasn’t bloomed yet, so it’s not time to enter!</p><p>Emperor formless spoke. He didn’t hide anything, and his voice traveled far and wide.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. Could it be that there was a small world beneath the cave?</p><p>gather all the powerhouses below the martial Supreme realm in the Heng clan!</p><p>Emperor Heng gave the order and then left..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
