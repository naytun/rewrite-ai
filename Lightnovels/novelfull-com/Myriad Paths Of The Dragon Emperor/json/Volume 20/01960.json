At a glance, there were about a dozen of them. However, the turbulent void currents blocked his vision and Lu Ming could not see the specific appearance of the people.</p><p>Obviously, the other party had also discovered him.</p><p>The figure of the other party paused for a moment, then continued to step forward.</p><p>Not long after, the dozen or so figures in front of him became clear.</p><p>“Luo pokong!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Among the dozen or so people, he saw Luo pokong’s figure. In addition, there was another familiar face-Wu fengchen of the wind race!</p><p>At the same time, Luo pokong and Feng wuchen also saw him.</p><p>Luo pokong was stunned at first, but his opponent1 s eyes lit up and emitted a cold killing intent. He shouted, ” “Lu Ming, it s actually you. Don’t let him go, surround him!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Figures flickered around Luo pokong and Feng wuchen, surrounding Lu Ming. Powerful auras were locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Emperors-to-be were all experts in the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Obviously, only those like Luo pokong and Feng wuchen who had monarch weapons to protect their bodies could step into the void turbulence.</p><p>They were obviously the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect and the wind race.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, 1 didn’t expect to meet you here. This void turbulence shall be your burial ground!”</p><p>Luo pokong laughed arrogantly.</p><p>He had been defeated by Lu Ming several times and could not wait to kill Lu Ming. Unfortunately, Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying and he had too many heaven’s favorites around him. Even Luo cangqiong was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Even the eternal Star River had failed to kill Lu Ming. He had no chance at all in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, there were more than a dozen Emperor-to-be experts beside him and Feng wuchen. Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Even if he and bubbles joined forces, they might not be able to defeat more than ten Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly moved. He had the upper hand by striking first.</p><p>Together with bubbles, he charged towards the right.</p><p>Bubbles waved her hand and two transparent bubbles enveloped the two Emperor-to-be in front of her. Then, Lu Ming pointed two fingers and the chaotic finger of calamity exploded, bombarding the two Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Although the two emperors -to-be tried their best to resist, they were still severely injured. Their bodies were sent flying like cannonballs and almost exploded.</p><p>The two Emperor-to-be were blasted away and there was a hole in the encirclement. Lu Ming continued to flash forward.</p><p>However, at this moment, a figure caught up with Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed. His Iron Fist was like a mountain as it smashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The iron fist struck out, and the turbulent flow of the void was scattered, revealing a vacuum tunnel.</p><p>Lu Ming s expression changed. What a terrifying punch.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art!</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch as well.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the two fists collided, Lu Ming felt an extremely terrifying force surge towards him. Lu Ming felt his arms go numb and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>“This person is so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart sank slightly as he looked at the middle-aged man in front of him.</p><p>This brawny man’s combat strength was extremely shocking, far beyond the other Emperor-to-be.</p><p>this person s spiritual body is extraordinary. It’s a high grade heaven spiritual body!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>Of course, there were strong and weak Emperor-to-be combat strength. Lu Ming was not afraid of those who broke through to the Emperor-to-be realm with their earth spiritual body. He could even defeat and kill them.</p><p>However, if a heavenly spirit body broke through to the Emperor-to-be realm, his combat strength would undoubtedly be much stronger. The brawny man in front of him had broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm with a superior heavenly spirit body.</p><p>Such a person was already a top talent when he was young. He was only slightly weaker than the body of a King, but his combat strength was extremely shocking. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he was no match for him.</p><p>boom!</p><p>The man took another step forward and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Bubbles waved his hands and endless void turbulence gushed towards this person.</p><p>However, this person’s battle prowess was indeed shocking. His fists were like mountains as he continuously punched out, breaking apart the chaotic currents in the void.</p><p>bubble, don’t fight this person head-on. Go the other way!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>The two of them moved and rushed to the other side.</p><p>At this moment, the other Emperor-to-be also launched an attack on Lu Ming and the others. More than a dozen terrifying divine abilities drove the void turbulence and drowned Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Space-time light appeared on bubble’s body. He waved his hands and space-time turbulence rolled back towards his opponent, causing a continuous rumbling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and rushed to an Emperor-to-be. He pressed his hands together and nine illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared and pressed down on the man.</p><p>The man let out a long howl and tried his best to resist, but he was still forced to retreat.</p><p>Following that, countless runes appeared on Lu Ming’s left hand. He cast a sealing force and sealed the man while he pointed with all his might with his right hand.</p><p>&Nbsp; a chaos finger of tribulation shot toward this person.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the others, including the Emperor-to-be with the superior-class heavenly spirit body, also launched an attack on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, leave it to me, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles rushed out and spurted out with her small mouth. More than ten transparent bubbles appeared and covered more than ten Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>More than a dozen Emperor-to-be froze at the same time. Then, they burst out their strength and hit the transparent bubble.</p><p>As for the brawny man, his combat strength was indeed astonishing. After a few consecutive punches, he shattered the transparent bubble.</p><p>However, this delay had given Lu Ming enough time.</p><p>That Emperor-to-be was sealed by Lu Ming s sealing power. Then, the chaotic finger of tribulation fell. The Emperor-to-be screamed in pain and half of his body exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not give him any chance to react. The Tai Chi formation disk flew out from between his brows, and two Yin Yang fish swords shot out rapidly, slashing down and killing the man.</p><p>“Damn it, a bunch of trash! ”</p><p>Luo pokong roared from afar.</p><p>More than a dozen Emperor-to-be surrounded Lu Ming and his companion. Lu Ming had actually killed one of them. This was a disgrace.</p><p>“Use the sovereign weapon to stop this little girl. Leave Lu Ming to me!” He ordered.</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the wind race waved his hand and a small Pagoda appeared. It then grew rapidly like a mountain and endless gales whistled. Like a cage, it enveloped the bubble.</p><p>At the same time, the middle-aged brawny man charged at Lu Ming with all his might. His fist force was terrifying. Every punch caused the void to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed a few times, but the chaos finger of tribulation was also defeated after colliding with the other party. Lu Ming was at a disadvantage.</p><p>On the other side, paoba was dashing left and right to avoid the giant Pagoda.</p><p>However, there were too many Emperor-to-be on the other side. There were more than ten of them. They locked onto all directions and kept launching attacks. They blocked bubble’s escape route in a brutal and direct way.</p><p>There were even two of them who took out their monarch weapons and blocked bubble’s path of retreat.</p><p>For a moment, the bubble was trapped and it was difficult for it to help Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Tai Chi disk array and pressed it down on the middle-aged man. At the same time, the Dayan elixir furnace appeared and enlarged rapidly, smashing toward the man.</p><p>“I have a monarch weapon too!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly. A giant hammer appeared in his hand and he swung it at the Tai Chi formation disk and the DA yan elixir furnace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
