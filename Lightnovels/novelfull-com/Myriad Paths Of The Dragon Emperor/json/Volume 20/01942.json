You disobey the decree and are disrespectful. If this isn’t a rebellion, what is it? ” And I’ve already received news that you’ve secretly contacted Luoshui Kingdom and attempted to rebel against your superior to destroy mingyan Kingdom. You deserve to die ten thousand times!”</p><p>“Colluding with the Luoshui Kingdom? Nonsense, who would believe your one-sided words?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted.</p><p>“You want evidence? I’ll give it to you. Come out!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor’s cold voice was heard. Then, a strong man in his thirties walked out.</p><p>“Greetings to Your Majesty, greetings to the Imperial advisor!”</p><p>The brawny man saluted the monarch and the Imperial advisor.</p><p>“Wang Xing, what are you doing here?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was very surprised because Wang Xing was his guard and had followed her for many years. However, she did not let Wang Xing come to the capital. Shouldn’t Wang Xing be in the divine Dragon Army?</p><p>Ruan tianjiao had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>“Wang Xing, tell me everything you know!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor said.</p><p>Wang Xing nodded and said,” ruan tianjiao has indeed been secretly communicating with the Luoshui Kingdom and has been plotting. When the time is right, he is prepared to plot a rebellion and claim himself as the Emperor. However, I am a citizen of the mingyan Kingdom and am only loyal to the mingyan Kingdom and his Majesty. How can I allow such a thing to happen? today, I will reveal ruan tianjiao’s wild ambitions to the public!</p><p>Wang Xing’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Wang Xing, you dare to slander me!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted, his entire body trembling with anger.</p><p>It was obvious that Wang Xing had been bribed by the state preceptor and had framed her together with him.</p><p>However, Wang Xing was her guard, and many people would believe what he said.</p><p>“Ruan tianjiao, your scheme has been exposed. Why don’t you surrender? However, since Yan Song has pleaded for you, I can spare your life. As long as you destroy your cultivation, marry Yan Song, and hand over your military power, I will not announce your rebellion to the world and protect your innocence!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor said coldly, as if he had everything under control.</p><p>For this matter, he had already started planning. Everything was perfect, and ruan tianjiao had no room to resist.</p><p>The final outcome would be the same. His cultivation would be crippled, he would hand over his military power and marry his son, Yan Song.</p><p>Yan song’s eyes revealed a smug look as he looked at ruan tianjiao and Lu Ming with cold arrogance.</p><p>“A b * tch, a dog, and you want to fight with me? you don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>Yan Song laughed heartily, feeling extremely pleased with himself.</p><p>Especially when he looked at ruan tianjiao’s heroic face and perfect figure, his heart was burning, and he wanted nothing more than to take ruan tianjiao for himself.</p><p>But soon, he told himself.</p><p>“You guys… Despicable!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao trembled with anger. She understood that the state preceptor not only wanted Yan Song to marry her, but also to take away her military power.</p><p>Now, the other four marshals had already submitted to the Imperial advisor. If the divine Dragon Army was also seized, then the mingyan country would truly become the Imperial advisor’s world, and no one would be able to control him.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao turned to look at the king, but the king did not even look at her. He was only drinking with Consort Qing.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was thoroughly disappointed.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard faintly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The state preceptor, Yan Song, and the rest were stunned. They did not understand what Lu Ming meant.</p><p>“If you’re not talking, then you’re done, right? since you’re done, it’s my turn to speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the surroundings. He said with a faint smile,” today’s matter is like this. The Imperial advisor, Yan Song, and Consort Qing led the masses to rebel and kill the monarch, intending to replace him. Then, Marshal tianjiao arrived with his men and killed the rebellious Imperial advisor and the others to avenge the monarch. In the end, with the support of the people, ruan tianjiao became the Empress of the Ming Yan country.</p><p>What?</p><p>The state preceptor, Yan Song, Consort Qing, and everyone else at the scene, including ruan tianjiao, were all dumbfounded.</p><p>After a long while, he finally reacted.</p><p>hahaha, this kid is about to die. It looks like he’s scared crazy!</p><p>Yan Song laughed so hard that his tears were flowing.</p><p>The state preceptor, Consort Qing, and the others also laughed. Their laughter was full of contempt.</p><p>Lu Ming’s intention was to kill all of them and then let ruan tianjiao sit on the throne of the Empress. I low was that possible?</p><p>It was really crazy talk!</p><p>The Imperial advisor and the others shook their heads.</p><p>Lu Ming did not seem to notice the state preceptor and the rest’s expressions. Instead, he looked at ruan tianjiao and said,” “Sky flood Dragon, what do you think of my idea?”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was stunned and didn’t react for a moment.</p><p>“I understand. It’s not easy for you to do it. Let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then stood up and walked toward Yan Song.</p><p>“This person is crazy, kill him!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted.</p><p>“Brat, you’re talking nonsense. Die!”</p><p>One of the nine-star generals shouted. He took a step forward, and the ground rumbled. His burly body rushed toward Lu Ming like a mountain. His aura was shocking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. It was as if he did not see the general make a move. He allowed the general to attack him.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao cried out in alarm, but it was too late to save him.</p><p>“Brat, go to hell!”</p><p>Yan Song roared in his heart, his eyes filled with pride. He wanted to compete with him for his woman, he didn’t know what was good for him!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the Marshal. Two dark rays of light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the general’s body tremble and he fell to the ground with a thud. He was no longer breathing.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The general died suddenly and silently. No one saw how the general died or how Lu Ming did it.</p><p>The scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>The Imperial advisor’s eyes squinted and a cold light flashed in them.</p><p>“How dare you kill the commander of an Army? if this isn’t a rebellion, what is it? Attack, let’s attack together and kill this man!”</p><p>Beside the monarch, Consort Qing shouted.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>The other three nine-star generals attacked at the same time. All three of them were in the great circle of the bright Saint stage. When they attacked together, their momentum was rather terrifying. They wanted to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at the three marshals. His gaze was fixed on Yan Song and he softly uttered a word.</p><p>&Nbsp; the power of the God Sword Art spread out along with the sound and entered the three nine-star generals ‘bodies.</p><p>The three marshals were the same as the previous Marshal. Their bodies trembled slightly and their souls were destroyed by Lu Ming. Their bodies fell limply and they were no longer breathing.</p><p>Dead, he died again!</p><p>The four great marshals, the top cultivators of the mingyan country, were all dead in an instant. No one saw how they died.</p><p>A series of gasps rang out in the venue.</p><p>They only heard Lu Ming say the word ‘die’ indifferently and the three marshals were dead.</p><p>This was too terrifying. What kind of sacred art was this?</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming was the god of death and whoever he wanted to kill, had to die.</p><p>Yan song’s expression changed. He became as pale as a sheet of paper and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>The state preceptor and Consort Qing’s expressions also changed, becoming extremely serious.</p><p>They knew that they had encountered a troublesome expert..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
