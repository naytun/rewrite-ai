Now that he had burst out with his full strength, he sent Lu Ming flying back a hundred miles in one move. It was shocking.</p><p>At this moment, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others all looked worried.</p><p>The situation on their side was much better. With the death blade joining, the pressure on them was greatly reduced.</p><p>An ordinary Emperor-to-be would be killed by the death blade. Many of them had died at the hands of the death blade. Their blood was absorbed by the platform, and the blood-red Bridge grew longer and longer. It extended to the front and didn’t know if it reached the other side.</p><p>The star River strode in the air and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>On his body, a huge Bell enveloped him. It was as if it was transparent, and one could clearly see the shape of the Galaxy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re no match for me. In front of Yongheng, everything is meaningless. Kill!”</p><p>Xing Chen spoke indifferently, as if he had transformed into a God that was high above, looking down on the common people.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The eternal God Bell shook for the second time. Terrifying sound waves whizzed out. The space rippled like water, and it was as if there were thousands of soldiers and horses charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Some of the people behind Lu Ming had a drastic change of expression. They retreated one after another, afraid that they would be swept in.</p><p>With their combat strength, if they were swept in, they would definitely end up in pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. He raised his cultivation to the maximum and tried his best to resist.</p><p>The Tai Chi formation plate flew out and pressed forward.</p><p>At the same time, the primal Chaos tribulation finger and the prison-suppressing heaven art were unleashed.</p><p>However, it was all useless!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk was knocked away and lost its light.</p><p>The primal Chaos tribulation finger, even the prison suppression heavenly art, was unable to block it and was shattered.</p><p>It was not the chaos apocalyptic finger or the prison-suppressing heavenly art that was inferior to the other party. It was just that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was insufficient and his mastery was inferior to the other party’s. It was difficult for him to unleash such a powerful force.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure retreated again. This time, blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re pretty good to be able to block two of my attacks. However, your fate is already decided today!”</p><p>“Kill, all living things are silent!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The eternal God Bell shook for the third time.</p><p>This time, it was even more terrifying. The terrifying sound waves actually turned into an Army. They were like the divine soldiers in the legends. They held divine weapons and rode strange beasts. Their murderous intent soared to the sky as they came crushing towards Lu Ming. The entire void was shaking.</p><p>The attack this time was undoubtedly more terrifying. Lu Ming was knocked back and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>you are the first person in the same generation to block three of my eternal God Bell’s attacks. Hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword and I’ll let you die in one piece!</p><p>Xing Chen was incomparably arrogant. His snow-white robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p>He approached Lu Ming at top speed as if he was sure to win.</p><p>“Hehe, the power is indeed not bad, but it’s still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled. At this moment, his eyes were very cold.</p><p>It seemed that he had to give it his all!</p><p>Now, he could only increase the power of his third bloodline.</p><p>The third bloodline was too strange. Lu Ming had always avoided borrowing the power of the third bloodline. However, he had no choice but to do so now.</p><p>“Come, power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a hint of ferocity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A surge of blood-colored energy roared wildly and rushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming roared like a wild beast. A terrifying killing intent burst out and enveloped the surroundings.</p><p>The Galaxy was hit by this killing intent and its expression changed.</p><p>This killing intent made him feel as if he was facing an extremely powerful and crazy existence that wanted to slaughter all living beings and destroy everything.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s body swelled up. Bone spikes protruded from his body, making him look ferocious, like a demon who had walked out of purgatory.</p><p>Even Huang Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others were shocked.</p><p>They had never seen Lu Ming in such a state.</p><p>“Star River, watch me break your stupid Bell!”</p><p>Lu Ming howled, his eyes filled with malevolence and boundless killing intent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was not the same as before. Although he had endless killing intent, he had not lost his mind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved like a shadow. The next moment, he appeared in front of the Galaxy.</p><p>Almost no one had seen how Lu Ming moved. He was too fast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s claw reached out.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s nails had grown much longer. They were like sharp blades as they clawed at the Galaxy.</p><p>Xinghe’s expression changed, and he quickly launched an attack.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The eternal God Bell trembled and a sound wave that was even more terrifying than the previous one was released.</p><p>The sound wave collided with Lu Ming’s claw, producing a harsh and unpleasant sound.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming roared and tore with all his might. The sound wave was directly broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming approached the stellar River and threw a punch.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The punch landed on the eternal God Bell and a terrifying power instantly exploded. The eternal God Bell trembled madly and Xing Chen’s expression changed. His body was like a cannonball as he was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the void, causing it to tremble. He burst forward and caught up with the star River, his fists punching out like a storm.</p><p>“Shake!”</p><p>The eternal Star River roared and the eternal God Bell shook again. A terrifying sound wave rushed out.</p><p>This time, the sound wave was even more terrifying. Any ordinary</p><p>Emperor-to-be who came would die.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist was covered in a layer of blood-colored energy. It was indestructible and could break anything. It kept bombarding the sound waves and eventually destroyed them.</p><p>Then, he punched the eternal God Bell.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The eternal God Bell was a remarkable power condensed from the eternal laws of the stellar River. Now, a crack had appeared.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s fist force continued to bombard the eternal God Bell.</p><p>More and more cracks appeared on the eternal God Bell. Finally, with a bang, it exploded.</p><p>Xinghe’s face was pale. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was astonishing. He caught up in an instant and his violent attacks continued to pour out.</p><p>Xing Chen took out his Imperial Sword again and used all his strength to slash out sword light.</p><p>However, they could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had borrowed the vast power of the third bloodline and had almost reached his limit. He could barely retain a trace of intelligence. If he continued to borrow the power of the third bloodline, he would be drowned by endless killing intent and turned into a killing puppet.</p><p>It could be seen how violent Lu Ming’s current strength was.</p><p>In just a few moves, Xingxing River was sent flying and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>In the distance, Luo cangqiong was almost scared to death.</p><p>What kind of monster was Lu Ming? he could even defeat the eternal Star River. He was simply undefeatable.</p><p>“No, after we get out, 1 must ask Grandpa to send some experts to kill him. He must be killed!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared in his heart. He had a feeling that if Lu Ming did not die, he would be the one to die in the future..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
