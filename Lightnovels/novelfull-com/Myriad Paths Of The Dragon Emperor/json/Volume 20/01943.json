However, her spirit body was slightly higher. In terms of combat strength, she was ranked first among the five great marshals, but she wasn’t that much stronger.</p><p>Four such experts had died in front of Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s cultivation? Could it be that Lu Ming was an eminent Saint?</p><p>In the past, when she first met Lu Ming, although she felt that Lu Ming was extraordinary, she also felt that Lu Ming was at most similar to her.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would kill four top-tier experts without a sound.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the four marshals, he continued to move forward, walking toward Yan Song.</p><p>Every step seemed to knock on Yan song’s heart, making his heart tremble. The fear in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>kill him! Let’s kill him together!</p><p>Yan Song cried out hysterically.</p><p>“This person is plotting a rebellion to harm His Majesty. Quickly attack!”</p><p>Consort Qing also called out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Some figures rushed out from behind the king and the Imperial advisor.</p><p>These people all had very powerful auras. Many of them were even in the great circle of the bright Saint stage and were not any weaker than the four great marshals.</p><p>These people were the powerhouses trained by the imperial family and the Imperial advisor respectively. This was their true strength.</p><p>Many experts joined forces and their powers intertwined. It was like an inescapable net that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted again. The sound waves rolled out and spread out in all directions.</p><p>Those people who were charging towards him from all four directions were exactly the same as the four marshals from before. Their bodies trembled and then fell down limply, no longer breathing.</p><p>This time, even the state preceptor’s expression changed, becoming somewhat pale.</p><p>As for Yan Song and Consort Qing, they were completely terrified.</p><p>“Demon, you’re a demon!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted hysterically.</p><p>Lu Ming had only said one word and so many experts had died in an instant. This was beyond his understanding.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was a demon in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he continued to walk toward Yan Song.</p><p>Yan song’s body trembled in fear. He retreated continuously and shouted,” “Father, father, save me!”</p><p>“He can’t touch you!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor said coldly. Then, a shocking aura burst out from his body.</p><p>This aura was much stronger than anyone else’s.</p><p>“Great saint realm! Yan kui, you have broken through to the great saint realm!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao cried out in disbelief.</p><p>The state preceptor had already broken through to the great saint realm and was known as the number one master in mingyan country.</p><p>She could not help but feel worried for Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming’s expression did not change at all. It was as if the cultivation of the eminent Saint realm could not stir up any waves in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“Sword Brothers, let’s attack together!”</p><p>At this moment, the Imperial advisor suddenly spoke.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be such a person in Ming Yan country. That’s good. It’s safer to attack together!</p><p>An old voice came from behind the Imperial advisor. Then, two old men stepped out and stood with the Imperial advisor.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Then, the two elders exploded with a terrifying aura. The terrifying aura swept through the wind and clouds, changing the color of the sky.</p><p>These two old men were also in the great saint realm. Like the Imperial advisor, they were both in the great saint lower tier.</p><p>At the same time, two long swords that looked like water waves floated above the two old men’s heads.</p><p>shuishui double sword Saints, you are the unparalleled sword Saints of the Luoshui Kingdom. Yan kui, you are the one who colluded with the Luoshui Kingdom!</p><p>Ruan tian jiao shouted in shock.</p><p>The Wushuang Sword Saint of Luoshui Kingdom was the most terrifying expert in Luoshui Kingdom. Two top experts in the initial success of the Supreme Saint realm had appeared beside the Imperial advisor at this moment. Needless to say, the Imperial advisor had secretly contacted the Luoshui Kingdom. He was the real traitor.</p><p>“So what if I know? Today, you will all die!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor said coldly.</p><p>“Kill, father, kill this brat. No, cripple him first. I want him to suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>Yan Song was stunned at first. He had not expected the Imperial advisor’s cultivation to reach the great saint realm. Moreover, the unparalleled Sword Saint of the Luoshui Kingdom was also there.</p><p>However, he was immediately overjoyed and shouted with joy.</p><p>There were three great saints. Lu Ming was dead for sure, no matter what tricks he had up his sleeve.</p><p>The great saint realm was a legend in mingyan country.</p><p>“This is your trump card?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at Yan Song as he spoke indifferently. He stretched out a hand and pressed in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge hand suddenly appeared, covering the sky and the sun. It pressed down on the Imperial advisor and the sword Saint of Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>The terrifying aura spread in all directions, making the Imperial advisor and Sword Saint Wushuang of Luoshui Kingdom turn pale.</p><p>They felt that this aura was not something they could resist.</p><p>At this moment, they wanted to escape, but they realized that the space around them seemed to have frozen. They couldn’t escape at all.</p><p>“This… This…”</p><p>Yan Song and Consort Qing were completely stunned. They stared blankly at the god-like hand in the sky. Their bodies trembled like a sieve. This power made them despair.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor howled. He was unwilling to give up, and he still wanted to resist.</p><p>He formed a seal with his hands and struck out a terrifying palm print.</p><p>At the same time, the peerless Sword Saint of the Luoshui Kingdom also launched an attack. Two sword lights rushed into the sky like a river.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s hands, a great sage initial mastery was no different from an ant.</p><p>As the giant hand pressed down, the three’s attacks instantly collapsed. In the end, the giant hand covered the three of them and heavily slammed them onto the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth rumbled, dust filled the air, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>After a while, the smoke and dust disappeared, and everyone saw a huge palm print on the ground. The Imperial advisor, the peerless Sword Saint of Luoshui Kingdom, was lying in the palm print like a dead dog, spitting out blood.</p><p>Their auras were extremely weak, just like three ordinary people. Lu Ming’s attack just now had already crippled their cultivation.</p><p>The Imperial advisor’s eyes were filled with unwillingness and despair.</p><p>It was over. He knew that everything was over.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Yan Song suddenly screamed. His body turned into a streak of rainbow light and fled into the distance.</p><p>He actually ignored the state preceptor and the others and wanted to escape alone.</p><p>However, Lu Ming flicked his finger and a force flew out, piercing Yan song’s dantian. It pierced through his dantian and crippled his cultivation.</p><p>With his cultivation crippled, Yan Song could no longer fly. He fell heavily to the ground and let out a hysterical scream.</p><p>“You’re the only one left!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Consort Qing and the monarch.</p><p>“How dare you touch my beloved concubine! I’ll exterminate your entire family!”</p><p>The king shouted and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. The country ruler had completely lost his mind. There was no point in keeping him alive.</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his fingers and a stream of energy shot out, piercing the area between the country ruler’s eyebrows and killing him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
