He took a step forward and walked toward the Galaxy.</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression changed. He did not have the celestial Thearch’s physical body and was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>He quickly retreated and roared,” “Lu Ming, I thought you don’t need external help. If you’re so capable, why don’t you fight me with your true abilities?” “Alright, let’s battle at the same level!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xing Chen River gritted his teeth. He was not confident that he could win against Lu Ming in a battle of the same level. He might even lose more miserably. How could he agree to this?</p><p>you’re two levels higher than me, yet you’re asking me to fight you with my true abilities. You don’t dare to fight me at the same level. What a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and mocked.</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes were very cold. If he could, he would have cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>But at this moment, he could only escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the void trembled as a powerful force descended and enveloped everyone.</p><p>The next moment, the world spun and they disappeared from the Ninth World. Lu Ming found himself in the sky above the Lotus World, in the huge underground cave.</p><p>Around them, figures kept appearing. Huang Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, Luo Tianyi, and the others had all come out.</p><p>Of course, Luo cangqiong, Heng Xinghe, and the others had also come out.</p><p>It wasn’t just them, but those who were exploring other worlds were also moved out by a powerful force.</p><p>“Look, what’s that?”</p><p>“The Nine Worlds are moving!”</p><p>“A vortex has appeared in the heart of the lotus!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked down and were shocked.</p><p>From this position, they could clearly see the situation below.</p><p>Below him, the nine petals of the lotus flower were slowly moving outward.</p><p>And at the center of the Lotus, a vortex appeared.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying roar came from the vortex. Then, two pairs of giant claws stretched out from the vortex.</p><p>These two pairs of claws had sharp nails and were covered in scales. They looked very ferocious.</p><p>Then, the two pairs of claws grabbed one side of the vortex, as if they were trying to expand the vortex.</p><p>A shocking scene appeared. The vortex was actually slowly growing larger. Then, two huge creatures poked their heads out of the vortex. The claw just now had come from them.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming was all too familiar with this kind of creature.</p><p>Its entire body was covered in scales, and it had a third eye on its forehead. It looked like a three-eyed God.</p><p>“Could this vortex lead to the three-eyed God race? The three-eyed God race is about to invade!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning and his heart was extremely heavy.</p><p>When he was weak, he followed the ancient desolate city and mistakenly entered a small island in the heavenly realm. It was the first time he came into contact with the three-eyed God race, and after that, he would come into contact with them from time to time.</p><p>He had seen the Titan longhorn beetle during the battle of Providence, and later during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the same time, he began to understand more and more about the three-eyed God race.</p><p>The three-eyed God race didn’t belong to the heaven realm or the primordial realm, but to another world. However, countless years ago, they attacked the heaven realm, causing a Great War to break out in the heaven realm. The people were plunged into misery and suffering, and blood flowed like rivers.</p><p>Countless experts had fallen!</p><p>Dandan once said that the final battle would soon arrive, and it was also related to the three-eyed God race.</p><p>Could it be that the three-eyed God race was about to attack?</p><p>He finally understood what the celestial Emperor’s seal meant when it said that the three-eyed God race was invading.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>These two three-eyed gods were completely different from the ones Lu Ming had encountered in the past. Their bodies were too burly and incomparably huge. As they supported the vortex, the vortex grew larger and larger.</p><p>“Kill, kill all the way to the primordial realm!”</p><p>“My clan will rule the world!”</p><p>Roars came from the vortex, causing everyone’s expression to change.</p><p>“This … What is it?”</p><p>Someone’s voice trembled.</p><p>could it be that the previous Nine Worlds were suppressing this passageway?”</p><p>Someone speculated with an ugly expression.</p><p>At this moment, the space above the heart of the lotus flower cracked open, and a huge figure appeared.</p><p>It was the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>From this angle, the celestial Thearch’s body seemed to be about the same size as the three-eyed God.</p><p>evil god race, get back to your world!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body roared as he slashed down with the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The arm of a giant three-eyed creature was cut off by the celestial Emperor sword.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The three-eyed creature roared, and a beam of destructive light shot out from its third eye toward the celestial Emperor’s body.</p><p>However, the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body punched out and destroyed the Light of Destruction. At the same time, the Battle Sword stabbed down, piercing the three-eyed creature’s forehead.</p><p>Blood gushed out as the giant sword reached the hilt. Sword Qi exploded, crushing the three-eyed creature’s head into pieces.</p><p>After the three-eyed creature died, its claws let go of the vortex, and its massive figure disappeared into it.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body wielded a combat sword and was about to attack another three-eyed creature.</p><p>But at this moment, space cracked open and a few figures stepped out.</p><p>One of them was the demon spirit religion master.</p><p>“You’re only left with a physical body, yet you still want to stop us. Today, I’ll destroy your physical body as well!”</p><p>The devil spirit religion master coldly said as he charged toward Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body slashed at the demon spirit religion master with a backhand, sending him flying.</p><p>Even if the celestial Emperor only had his physical body left, his power was still shocking.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the space kept cracking open, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>The dark-skinned man from the divine time Island and the gigantic lizard from the myriad Beast Realm were both emitting a boundless aura.</p><p>great emperor! They’re all great emperors!</p><p>Someone shouted in shock.</p><p>These people who had suddenly appeared were all great emperors.</p><p>“Could these existences be the sealed existences in the ruins?”</p><p>Someone voiced out his guess.</p><p>Many people were silent.</p><p>It seemed that something big was going to happen.</p><p>The previous changes might have been related to these powerful existences.</p><p>Some people cast their gazes toward the Galaxy.</p><p>They remembered that the celestial Emperor’s Mark had said that if they stepped forward, they would cause great suffering and blood to flow like rivers. Perhaps, he was referring to this.</p><p>Wasn’t all of this caused by the Galaxy?</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Xinghe snorted coldly, his face gloomy.</p><p>He didn’t care about the lives of the people, but what did the life and death of others have to do with him? What he was thinking about now was how to get his hands on Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body and Celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying battle had erupted.</p><p>The demon spirit religion master, the giant lizard, and the other experts attacked the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body at the same time. The void at the heart of the lotus flower trembled.</p><p>“Hengyu, you’ve suppressed me for countless years. Today, I’m going to devour your body!”</p><p>The giant lizard roared and spewed out terrifying flames that surged toward Celestial Emperor’s body.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body slashed the flames apart..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
