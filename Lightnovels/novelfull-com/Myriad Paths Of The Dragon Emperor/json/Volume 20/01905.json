The illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and blocked in front of him.</p><p>However, when the palm print came, the prison-suppressing stele’s shadow exploded. Lu Ming’s body was sent flying back tens of thousands of meters before he stopped in the air, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>A young man with snow-white skin and long black hair came to Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“The star River!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Many people were shocked. It was Heng Xinghe, the number one on the Saint King ranking, who had sent Lu Ming flying and injured him with one move. Was he going to make a move against Lu Ming?</p><p>“Brother Heng…”</p><p>Luo cangqiong was overjoyed. At the same time, he stuffed pills into his mouth and started to heal his wounds.</p><p>“You want to interfere?” Lu Ming stared at the Galaxy.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong is the great Emperor’s grandson, how can he be humiliated by you?”</p><p>Said the Heng Xing River.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. According to the eternal Star River, could it be that the grandson of the great emperor could bully others and others could not resist or suppress him? It was laughable.</p><p>At that moment, Xing Chen continued,” furthermore, I’m looking for you for another reason. You were the one who pulled out the celestial Emperor’s sword, right? that belongs to the Heng family. Now, hand it over to me!</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. As expected, the Galaxy had taken action because of this matter.</p><p>The hearts of the surrounding paragons trembled. It turned out that the true purpose of the Xingxing river’s attack was to obtain the celestial Emperor’s sword. Saving Luo cangqiong was just a passing act.</p><p>The news that Lu Ming had pulled out the celestial Thearch’s sword had long caused an uproar in the heavenly Emperor City. Now that Lu Ming had returned, the Heng family was indeed looking for him.</p><p>How should Lu Ming face it? Should he hand it over or not?</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Legend has it that the sword was left behind by the heavenly Emperor. However, it’s only a legend and might not be true. You said that the sword belongs to the Heng family, but do you have any evidence? Perhaps it was left behind by some other unparalleled expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded.</p><p>Although it was said that the sword was the heavenly Emperor’s sword and was left behind by the heavenly Emperor who founded heavenly Emperor City, it was only a legend. Could the Heng family produce any evidence?</p><p>Xinghe placed his hands behind his back and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes, everyone in heavenly Emperor City knows that the sword was left behind by the heavenly Emperor, and the Heng family is the descendant of the heavenly Emperor. Why do we need to prove this? ”</p><p>Since you are the descendant of the celestial Emperor, why can’t you pull out that sword?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was sonorous and powerful, spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Xing Chen’s face darkened instantly. Lu Ming was mocking him for not being able to pull out the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>“I will pull out the celestial Emperor’s sword sooner or later!”</p><p>Xing He said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, could it be that drawing the sword is related to cultivation?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. Lu Ming was mocking the Galaxy.</p><p>Everyone knew that pulling out the celestial Emperor’s sword had nothing to do with one’s cultivation.</p><p>There was once a Martial Emperor who could not even pull it out by one foot, but there was someone who had just started cultivating who could pull it out five feet.</p><p>He had once pulled the sword out of the stellar River by nine feet, but he would probably only be able to pull it out by nine feet in his entire life. The chances of pulling it out would not increase with the improvement of his cultivation.</p><p>Yet, the Galaxy said that he would pull it out sooner or later.</p><p>Lu Ming’s rhetorical question was clearly mocking the Galaxy.</p><p>Xinghe’s expression turned even uglier. The light in his eyes became even sharper, like two divine swords.</p><p>besides, even if that sword was really left behind by the celestial Emperor, and the Heng family is the descendant of the celestial Emperor, why didn’t the celestial Emperor leave the sword to the Heng family? instead, he stuck it on the platform and sealed it for thousands of years. It’s obvious that the celestial Emperor wants to find someone who can pull out the sword. Only the person who can pull out the sword is qualified to hold the sword. This is what the celestial Emperor wants!</p><p>if the Heng family is really the descendant of the heavenly Emperor, you should respect the heavenly Emperor’s will and not go against the will of your ancestors!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak. His sonorous and powerful voice made many people look thoughtful.</p><p>That’s right. If that sword was really left behind by the celestial Emperor, why didn’t he just leave it to the Heng family? instead, he stuck it on the platform and let others pull it out.</p><p>In other words, only the one who pulled it out had the right to wield the celestial Emperor’s sword. This was the true meaning of the celestial Emperor.</p><p>you’ve got a glib tongue and you’re twisting the truth. Lu Ming, 1 didn’t want to bully you with your cultivation base. But since you’re asking for death today, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>The Galaxy shouted and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura bloomed from his body. A mysterious and terrifying law surrounded his body.</p><p>It was one of the ten ultimate maxims, the eternal Maxim.</p><p>Eternal, eternal, eternal!</p><p>The eternal law was similar to Huang Ling’s law of unperishable flame, but its power was much stronger than the unperishable flame.</p><p>The eternal law not only gave the user an extremely strong life force, but it also had terrifying offensive power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xingxing River took a step forward and approached Lu Ming rapidly. Then, he struck out with his palm and a palm print blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and he felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Xing Chen’s cultivation was too strong, and the power of his palm had the power to destroy the world.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar and circulated his cultivation to the extreme. He then pointed out a chaos tribulation finger that was at ninety percent maturity.</p><p>At the same time, his body lit up with spots of light. More than two hundred holy weapons flew out and hovered around Lu Ming, forming a defensive force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos finger of tribulation collided with the palm print of the star River.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The 90%-completed finger of tribulation of chaos did not even manage to block a few attacks before it exploded. The terrifying power surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch out, and at the same time, more than two hundred Saint weapons blocked in front of him. However, when the palm print came, Lu Ming’s body trembled. The two hundred Saint weapons buzzed, and his body was sent flying far away.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for the Heng Xing River. The difference in their cultivation levels was too great.</p><p>they are both children of God, but Xing Chen’s cultivation level is much higher. Lu Ming is no match for him at all!</p><p>that’s natural. As children of God, they usually fight at the same level. If there’s a difference in cultivation, there’s no point in fighting!</p><p>“I’m afraid Lu Ming won’t be able to keep the celestial Emperor’s sword today!”</p><p>Some people in the surroundings sighed. Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, Xing Chen was the eternal Son. His combat strength was not weak either. With a much higher cultivation, Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>With his hands behind his back, the star River stepped toward Lu Ming with an invincible aura.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The star River took a step forward. A huge foot descended from the sky and stomped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t even think about hurting the young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue! a voice sounded and a figure rushed into the sky. It was Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue’s glabella glowed, and the monarch weapon, the Yin Yang wheel, appeared and struck at the giant foot.</p><p>At the same time, a Phoenix’s cry was heard. Huang Ling also rushed into the sky. She was bathed in the unperishable flame, almost turning into a Phoenix. At the same time, a pair of phoenix wings flapped out from her back and attacked the giant foot..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
