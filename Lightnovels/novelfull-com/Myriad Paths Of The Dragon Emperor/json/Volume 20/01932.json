Then, he also left the place.</p><p>Then, Emperor notionless and the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect left.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>As soon as the great emperor left, the others could no longer suppress their curiosity and rushed to the sky above the cave. For a moment, the sky was filled with countless figures.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed the crowd and flew to the sky to look down.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked when they saw it.</p><p>On the ground, there was a very large cave. No one knew how deep it was. In the cave, there was a bright light spreading out.</p><p>In the deepest part of the cave, there was a lotus flower. This lotus flower was still in its bud state and had not bloomed. Upon closer inspection, one could see that it had nine petals.</p><p>It was obvious that the Lotus in the sky was a projection of this Lotus.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but think of Emperor notionless’s words.</p><p>The Lotus had nine petals, representing Nine Worlds. The Lotus had not bloomed yet, so he could not enter for the time being.</p><p>Did the nine petals of that lotus flower represent Nine Worlds?</p><p>Was this the world left behind by the celestial Emperor?</p><p>Everyone’s imagination ran wild. However, they soon realized that only those below the martial Supreme realm could enter.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>There were void Emperor and even true Emperor experts who flew down into the cave. However, when they entered the cave, a terrifying energy seemed to have been produced inside the cave. All these Emperor-level experts were blown out without exception.</p><p>Only the powerhouses below the martial Supreme realm could stabilize their bodies. However, they were also blocked by a powerful force when they approached the Lotus.</p><p>Countless people went down to test it out, but the result was the same.</p><p>Everyone knew that they still had to wait. They had to wait for the moment the Lotus bloomed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not go down to test the waters. The great emperor had said that there was no need for them to go down. They just had to wait patiently.</p><p>After that, they followed the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy and returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Following that, the news of this place spread to the entire Yuan mountain at a terrifying speed.</p><p>It was very likely that the celestial Thearch had left behind some ruins that had shocked countless people.</p><p>One after another, powerful forces descended upon heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The forces of the other eight sacred lands and some ancient clans had also sent their experts over.</p><p>Ancient Moon Holy Land, Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, Wan family, Sirius tower, golden Crow clan, etc. All had experts coming, and they were all led by true emperors. They brought many experts below Martial Emperor, and most of them were Emperor-to-be.</p><p>This was very likely a relic left behind by the celestial Emperor, and everyone wanted a share of it.</p><p>If an Emperor-level expert couldn’t go down, the best choice would be an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>As time passed, more and more powerful martial artists arrived at heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>As time passed, the lotus flower slowly bloomed.</p><p>A month later, when the Lotus was about to fully bloom, countless people gathered in the area. At a glance, it was unknown how many people there were</p><p>Most of them were at the absolute Saint realm and Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>let’s go! a loud shout rang out as a group of experts exploded forth with a terrifying aura. The crowd couldn’t help but make way for them.</p><p>They were from the Heng clan. The Heng clan had sent over a hundred people, and the leaders were a few true Emperor experts.</p><p>Although the Heng family was overbearing, many people did not dare to voice their anger.</p><p>The Heng family was a great Emperor’s force. With a great emperor in charge, which force would dare to provoke them?</p><p>“The Heng family is really overbearing!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. Following that, the people of the he clan also arrived. They said that the Heng clan was overbearing, but they weren’t any different. The true Emperor opened up a path, and the crowd forcefully opened up a path for him.</p><p>The Heng family and the he family were at daggers drawn. Then, the powerhouses of the Daluo heaven sect also arrived, followed by several powerful ancient clans.</p><p>The teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy had also arrived with a group of young geniuses.</p><p>Si la! “Hiss!”</p><p>Suddenly, the space near the cave was torn open. A few figures appeared, exuding a terrifying aura. It was the aura of a great emperor.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but step back.</p><p>The emperors all looked at the Lotus below.</p><p>Half a day later, the lotus flower was finally in full bloom.</p><p>“Go down!”</p><p>The Emperor from the Heng family said.</p><p>The Heng family’s powerhouses immediately rushed down the cave. Of course, they were all below the Martial Emperor realm. Most of them were Emperor-to-be and absolute Saints.</p><p>Then, the powerhouses of the he family and the Daluo heaven sect also rushed into the cave. Lu Ming saw Luo cangqiong and Luo pokong among the powerhouses of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>“Let’s charge too!”</p><p>The people from the other forces shouted one after another. Then, they gathered together and rushed into the cave.</p><p>The emperors didn’t stop them, and they all entered the cave.</p><p>“You guys go too!”</p><p>The teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>In fact, there weren’t many heaven’s favorites following the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The majority of the major powers had arrived. Those geniuses all returned to their respective powers and followed them into the caves. Only a few people remained in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded and then rushed toward the cave.</p><p>The cave was huge, and even though countless people were flying down, it did not seem crowded.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked down and realized that when many people approached the Lotus, their bodies would shrink rapidly. Then, they would rush toward one of the petals and disappear among the petals.</p><p>It seemed to be random. You couldn’t go to any petal you wanted to. You would enter a random petal.</p><p>Many people from the major forces flew over and entered the different flower petals.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt that danger was approaching.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying golden light shot toward Lu Ming from his right.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he threw a punch to the right.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the golden light was destroyed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a group of people in golden robes staring at him coldly.</p><p>“It’s an expert from the Golden Crow clan!”</p><p>On the side, Huang Ling spoke.</p><p>“The Golden Crow race!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent. These people were obviously the absolute Saints of the Golden Crow race, and even Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>The person who had ambushed Lu Ming was an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>an expert from the Golden Crow clan actually launched a sneak attack on a junior. If you want to fight, let’s fight!</p><p>An old man beside Huang Ling said coldly.</p><p>This old man was an expert from the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect had sent their experts here, following Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you killed the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow clan. We must settle this score. 1 hope you don’t run into us when you enter the world left behind by the celestial Thearch!”</p><p>An expert from the Golden Crow race coldly said.</p><p>“I hope he’ll always be so lucky!”</p><p>Another cold voice rang out. It did not come from the Golden Crow race, but another force.</p><p>The WAN family!</p><p>There were also experts from the Skywolf tower and other forces nearby. They all looked at Lu Ming coldly, full of murderous intent..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
