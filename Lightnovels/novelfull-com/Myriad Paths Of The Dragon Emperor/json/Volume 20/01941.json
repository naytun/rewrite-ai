His hair was white and he was dressed in fine clothes. His appearance was similar to Yan song’s.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this person should be the state preceptor.</p><p>The Imperial advisor’s eyes squinted slightly with a faint smile. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking, but he gave off the feeling of a wily old fox.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there were two people.</p><p>One of them was an old man with snow-white hair. He wore a dragon robe and a Jade crown. From the looks of it, he should be the king of mingyan country.</p><p>Beside the king of mingyan country sat a beautiful woman. This woman looked to be in her twenties. She had a lithe figure, and her eyes were like silk. She was extremely charming and enchanting. This person should be Yan song’s older sister, Consort Qing.</p><p>In the other seats, there were also some people sitting. Each of them had an extraordinary temperament. They should all be high-level figures of Ming Yan country.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao strode forward and bowed to the king of Ming Yan country. “Your humble servant greets Your Majesty!”</p><p>haha, Tian Jiao is back. No need for formalities, please take a seat!</p><p>The king of Ming Yan laughed.</p><p>“Many thanks, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said. With that, he and Lu Ming walked to a row of seats at the side and sat down.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming! Who Do You Think You Are? what right do you have to sit there!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just sat down when on the other side, Yan Song slammed the table and stood up. He looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. They were going to make things difficult so quickly!</p><p>“Why aren’t you getting up? don’t you see where you are? Who was the person sitting here? Do you have the right to sit here with your status? Quickly get up and roll to the side!”</p><p>Yan Song berated once again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear her. He picked up the wine glass on the table and slowly took a sip.”Good wine, it’s really good wine. Unfortunately, there’s a wild dog barking and it spoiled my mood!”</p><p>“You… How bold!”</p><p>Yan Song was furious. His eyes were filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>“You think you’re very noble? Why did you kneel in front of me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in disdain.</p><p>“Shut up! Men, take this person’s seat away!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted. Immediately, someone stepped forward and wanted to take away Lu Ming’s seat.</p><p>The king of Ming Yan country, Consort Qing, the state preceptor, and the others all looked on indifferently, as if they were watching a good show.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>stop! ruan tianjiao shouted. A murderous aura that had been on the battlefield emanated from her, causing the guard who was about to take Lu Ming’s seat to freeze and stop in his tracks.</p><p>“Lu Ming is my friend. If you want to remove Lu Ming’s position, you can remove mine as well!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The guard was stunned and didn’t know what to do.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s status could not be compared to Lu Ming’s. He was the Marshal of the divine Dragon Army and the goddess of war of the mingyan country. How would he dare to remove ruan tianjiao from his seat?</p><p>“Retreat? why aren’t we retreating?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s gaze was threatening as he stared at the guard. Cold sweat broke out on the Guard’s face as he cast a pleading look at Yan Song, the state preceptor, and the others.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yan Song was incomparably furious and extremely jealous.</p><p>It was unknown what medicine Lu Ming had given ruan tian jiao to make him protect Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp;” okay, you can leave. Since this little brother is a friend of a genius nine-star general, you can naturally sit here!</p><p>At this moment, the Imperial advisor spoke indifferently.</p><p>The guard felt as if he had been granted Amnesty. He let out a long breath, bowed, and retreated.</p><p>“Tian Jiao, you’ve returned just in time. I’ve already bestowed you with a marriage, and the date has already been set. You’ve returned just in time to complete the marriage with Yan Song!”</p><p>The country ruler said from above.</p><p>Your Majesty, this lowly subject has returned from this trip because of this matter. Matters of the heart can not be forced. This lowly subject does not have the slightest feeling for Yan Song. Your Majesty, please retract your order!</p><p>Ruan tian jiao stood up and bowed to the king.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Beside the monarch, Consort Qing shouted coldly,” “The Emperor does not play with his words. Since His Majesty has already given the decree, how can he take it back? ruan tianjiao, do you want His Majesty to be a man of his word?”</p><p>“This lowly subject doesn’t dare!”</p><p>yes! ruan tianjiao cupped his fists and said,” for other matters, 1 will definitely respect you. If you want me to go to the battlefield and kill the enemy, I will not even frown. But for this matter, I can not accept your orders!</p><p>“Tian Jiao, Consort Qing has also said that the Emperor does not play with his words. Moreover, Yan Song is not bad and is a good match for you. Let’s settle this matter!”</p><p>The country ruler waved his hand, his tone unquestionable.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was simply in disbelief. He didn’t expect that the country ruler would actually marry her to Yan Song so rashly without her consent. Although the previous country ruler was muddleheaded, he wouldn’t have done this.</p><p>His Majesty has already announced to the world that the two of you will be married in half a month. This matter is settled. During this period, general Tian Jiao will stay in the palace!</p><p>The Imperial advisor spoke as if he had decided on this matter.</p><p>Ruan tian jiao shook his head and was extremely disappointed in the king.</p><p>Originally, she had come back to demand an explanation from the country ruler and make him retract his order. But now she found out that the country ruler was completely on the side of the state preceptor.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word. There was a strange glint in his eyes. He secretly sized up the king and found something interesting.</p><p>Tian Jiao, I’m afraid that the king will not listen to you. That Consort Qing is good at seduction. The king has been bewitched and will listen to Consort Qing!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to ruan tianjiao.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ruan tian jiao was stunned for a moment before he flew into a rage. He suddenly stood up, and a powerful aura emanated from him. He glared at the Imperial Preceptor and shouted,” “Yan kui, and Yan Xun, how dare you use your seduction techniques to bewitch His Majesty!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the expressions of Consort Qing, the state preceptor, Yan Song, and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“Ruan tianjiao, what nonsense are you spouting?”</p><p>Yan Song bellowed.</p><p>“Whether I’m talking nonsense or not, you both know in your hearts. Yan kui, Yan Zheng, you dared to secretly harm His Majesty and secretly manipulate His Majesty. No wonder His Majesty ignored the state affairs and gave you all the power. I will announce this matter to the world!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>With that, ruan tianjiao strode out.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The state preceptor’s face darkened. With a wave of his hand, four figures flickered and surrounded Lu Ming and ruan tianjiao. Each of them exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Great circle of bright Saint!</p><p>Lu Ming did not even need to look to know that the four of them were in the great circle of the bright Saint stage and were not weaker than ruan tianjiao.</p><p>“The four of you are marshals, yet you’re willing to degrade yourself and take orders from the state preceptor?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said with a grave expression.</p><p>These four people were as famous as her. The other four great generals of mingyan country had strong combat strength. They were all in the great circle of the bright Saint stage. Each of their combat strength was not much weaker than hers. If the four of them joined forces, she would definitely not be able to defeat them.</p><p>“Ruan tianjiao, you disobeyed the decree and are indeed a Wolf with wild ambitions. You want to rebel!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor spoke indifferently and accused ruan tianjiao of a serious crime.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shouted. It was clearly the state preceptor and the others who were rebelling, yet they still said she was rebelling..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
