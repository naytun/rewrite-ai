He looked ahead with cold eyes.</p><p>In front of him, a middle-aged man stood on the lake with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>He Yutang looked at the middle-aged man and narrowed his eyes. He did not know this man.</p><p>“The person who wants your life!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly. Then, he dashed toward he Yutang. Saint power surged in his hand and formed a long sword.</p><p>Like a rainbow light, the long sword stabbed toward he Yutang as fast as lightning.</p><p>He Yutang was shocked. He exploded with all his power and a saber appeared in his hand. He slashed at the middle-aged man.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long sword and the saber collided, creating a buzzing sound. He Yutang’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>eternal spring’s laws. You’re from the Heng family. Why do you want to kill me?”</p><p>He Yutang roared.</p><p>At this time, the people in the sailboats and other pavilions on the lake had long been alarmed. They looked over in their direction and were all shocked.</p><p>The laws of eternal spring were unique to the Heng family!</p><p>Only the bloodline and body constitution of the Heng family could comprehend the laws of eternal spring.</p><p>The Heng family came to kill he Yutang?</p><p>The Heng family and the he family were sworn enemies. A thousand years ago, there had been a fierce battle between them. However, in the last few hundred years, their relationship had eased a lot. Although there were still some conflicts, there were very few people who would kill each other in front of the public for no reason.</p><p>Now, why did the middle-aged man want to kill he Yutang?</p><p>he Qian old dog, you’re so shameless. You took away the Heng family’s treasure and didn’t return it. Then, I’ll make your he family disciples pay the price!</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly. His aura exploded, and a terrifying sword light cut through the air and slashed toward he Yutang.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>run! he Yutang roared madly. He wanted to escape, but the difference in combat strength between him and his opponent was too great. With a slash of the sword, all his resistance collapsed. His entire body was cut in half, and his corpse fell into the lake.</p><p>“He Qian old dog, you only have yourself to blame!”</p><p>The middle-aged man left these words and soared into the sky, leaving the place.</p><p>This middle-aged man was naturally Lu Ming in disguise.</p><p>Previously, at the yuan mountain sacred Academy, he had seen he Qian and the two true emperors of the Heng family in conflict. From the words of the other party, Lu Ming speculated that he Qian must have used him as a condition to take the Heng family’s treasure. Later on, the Heng family wanted it back, but he Qian did not return it.</p><p>Back then, the two true emperors of the Heng family had shouted that they wanted the he family to pay the price. Now, Lu Ming was taking advantage of this and attacking the he family members to provoke a conflict between the two sides.</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s chaos laws, other than the kingly laws and the ten ultimate laws, all the other laws could be changed.</p><p>The laws of eternal spring were not the laws of the king path. Naturally, Lu Ming could change them.</p><p>An expert from the Heng family had killed he Yutang, the pride of the he family!</p><p>The reason was that he Qian of the he family had taken the Heng family’s treasure.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, this piece of news spread at a terrifying speed from the drunken immortal restaurant.</p><p>Not long after, a few old men sat in a Hall of the he family. The atmosphere was very serious.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He Qian slammed the table heavily, his eyes full of anger, preposterous! Is the Heng family going to start a war with our he family? ”</p><p>They had already received the news of he Yutang’s death and were currently discussing this matter.</p><p>it’s all because of you. You embezzled the Heng family’s divine robe for tribulation, which caused such a disaster. He Yutang also died because of you!</p><p>The other old man said coldly.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>He Qian’s eyes were cold as he looked at the person.</p><p>That person was an existence at the same level as he Qian, so how could he be afraid of he Qian? he sneered and said,” it’s very clear what I mean. If you didn’t take the Heng family’s treasure, why would they send people to kill my he family? no matter what, you have to pay the price for this. Hand over the divine robe and it will belong to the family!</p><p>Of course, the he family was not United. It was divided into various factions.</p><p>Bullsh * t, 1 deserve the divine clothing. If you want it, fight me. Let’s see what you can do.</p><p>die! he Gao shouted, his powerful aura filling the hall.</p><p>alright, stop arguing. The most important thing now is how to deal with the Heng family’s revenge!</p><p>The other old man waved his hand and said.</p><p>“At worst, we’ll just fight the Heng family!”</p><p>He Gao said coldly.</p><p>It was impossible for him to hand over the divine clothing for tribulation transcendence. The divine clothing was related to whether he could survive the heavenly Tribulation or not, and it was more important than anything.</p><p>At this moment, they received a message at the same time. They took out their Jade voice transmission talismans and their expressions changed again.</p><p>“Damn it, the Heng family is too much!”</p><p>“Is this an all-out war?”</p><p>The few elders roared.</p><p>They had just received news that two more experts from the he family had been killed by the Heng family.</p><p>If it could be tolerated, then who couldn’t?</p><p>The Heng family was obviously going to take revenge. If they delayed any longer, who knew how many people would be killed.</p><p>let’s go to the Heng family. I’d like to see if they want to start a full-scale war.</p><p>An old man sitting at the head of the table said coldly before walking out.</p><p>The other elders, including he Qian, also followed. They left the hall and headed straight for the Heng family.</p><p>In a Hall of the Heng family, some elders were discussing some matters.</p><p>“Who sent people to kill the he family?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>we didn’t do that. Although he Qian was despicable and took the divine clothing for himself, we were still thinking of a way and didn’t send anyone to kill the he family members!</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor who had given the Tribulation-transcending divine robe to he Qian said with a frown.</p><p>The others also looked at each other!</p><p>They didn’t send anyone, so who was it that killed the he family? Could it be a private act of the Heng family’s descendants?</p><p>the people of the he clan are despicable and shameless. In my opinion, we should just kill them!</p><p>The other true Emperor said coldly.</p><p>A thousand years ago, the he clan and the Heng clan had an intense war. These Emperor-level figures had all fought with the he clan back then and had great enmity with them. So what if they killed a few people of the he clan?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying fluctuation came from outside the Heng family. Many powerful auras filled the air.</p><p>“Hmph, it seems like the people from the he family have come!”</p><p>he Qian took our divine clothing for tribulation transcendence, and the people of the he clan still dare to come here. Make them hand over the divine clothing!</p><p>The elders snorted and rushed out of the hall.</p><p>Outside the Heng family, he Qian and the other experts of the he family stood in the sky. Terrifying auras emanated from their bodies as they pressed down on the Heng family’s Palace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the Heng family, many experts appeared in a flash.</p><p>In the end, a few elders from the Heng family flew over. Each of them exuded a vast aura that negated the aura of the he family’s powerhouses.</p><p>he Qian, you still dare to come? hand over the divine clothing!</p><p>The Heng clan’s white-haired true Emperor stared at he Qian, and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
