Lu Ming would often go to the Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect to find long Chen and the Phoenix Spirit for information.</p><p>The invasion of the foreign races shook the entire Yuan mountain. All the powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land were alarmed and started to gather the experts scattered all over the place to wait.</p><p>As time passed, news of the invasion of the foreign races kept coming.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor City had been completely occupied.</p><p>The overlords of the heavenly Emperor City, the Heng clan and the he clan, had escaped from the heavenly Emperor City with their entire clan and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Countless martial artists had died in the battle. The heavenly Emperor City had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>After the foreign tribes occupied heavenly Emperor City, a few days later, the foreign tribes began to send their Army to all directions of heavenly Emperor City. Wherever they passed, not even a chicken or a dog would be left.</p><p>One by one, the Emperor-ranked forces were attacked by the foreign races. From martial sovereigns to women and children who did not know martial arts, they were all killed.</p><p>Everywhere it passed, blood flowed like a river, and hundreds of millions of corpses were buried.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed. The methods of the foreign race were too ruthless. This was simply a massacre.</p><p>Around the heavenly Emperor City, all the Emperor-ranked powerhouses had withdrawn and retreated to the eight sacred lands.</p><p>Among the nine sacred grounds of the yuan mountain, the heavenly Emperor City was in the center. The other sacred grounds surrounded the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>During this period of time, many Emperor-ranked forces had entered ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>As for the outsiders, they had sent out their armies to attack in all directions. They were already approaching the other sacred lands.</p><p>Two months after the battle at heaven Emperor City, outside the ancient Moon Holy Land, the first foreign tribe Army appeared. When they attacked the ancient Moon Holy Land, they were defeated by the strong practitioners of the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Facing this unprecedented pressure, all the powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land temporarily put aside their grudges and formed an alliance.</p><p>The wind race had gathered all the forces together and built a huge base. All the forces and experts had gathered to resist the alien race.</p><p>The number of clashes between Gu Yue Holy Land and the other races increased.</p><p>“It’s chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood at the peak of the Dayan elixir Palace and looked into the distance as he muttered.</p><p>At that moment, a ray of light flashed in the distance. The speed was so fast that Lu Ming had only just reacted when the light appeared in front of him.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>When Lu Ming saw the true appearance of the ray of light, he could not help but be shocked.</p><p>A one-meter tall stone man and a stone sword.</p><p>Isn’t this the celestial Emperor’s sword?</p><p>Also, that was the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>Although it was countless times smaller than when he first saw it, Lu Ming could still recognize it at a glance. It was the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>In the last battle, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body wielded the stone sword and killed two great emperor powerhouses in a row with unparalleled divine power.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the rest returned to ancient Moon sanctuary. There was no more Celestial Emperor’s body or news of the great emperors.</p><p>At this moment, the celestial Thearch’s physical body and the celestial Thearch’s sword had arrived. From the looks of it, they were coming for Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s physical body and the celestial Thearch’s sword moved and flew directly into Lu Ming’s glabella, suspended in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>At that moment, a white light flashed in front of Lu Ming and a figure floated out. It was the celestial Thearch.</p><p>“Senior celestial Thearch, I’m lu Ming from the junior generation.” Lu Ming was shocked and quickly bowed.</p><p>“No need to be so polite, I’m just a wisp of mark!”</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s figure smiled.</p><p>“Senior heavenly Emperor, why did you … Why are you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>Back then, wasn’t the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body controlled by the star River? Why was it flying into his consciousness with the celestial Emperor’s sword?</p><p>“Heng Xinghe is too selfish. He only cares about himself and not others, so he has no right to control Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. You, on the other hand, have a good character, are decisive, and are extremely talented. Most importantly, you have something you want to protect!”</p><p>moreover, you were able to pull out the combat sword that 1 left behind years ago. This is enough to prove that you are qualified to control the item that 1 left behind!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor’s figure nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. He was not as good as what the celestial Thearch had said. He was just not that selfish.</p><p>“Senior heavenly Emperor, is the Heng family really your descendants?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The celestial Thearch pondered for a moment, as if reminiscing about the past. “I’m not a human. 1 attained Dao as a stone golem. When I first attained Dao, 1 gave birth to a descendant with a human woman. That descendant was the Heng family. Speaking of which, the Heng family is indeed my descendant!” however, countless years have passed, and these juniors seem to be becoming more and more useless. If you have a grudge against the Heng family, you don’t have to worry about me!</p><p>senior heavenly Emperor, it’s actually rockmen achieving Dao!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. No wonder the celestial Thearch’s physical body was a stone golem, and his sword was also made of stone.</p><p>“Senior, you have such a strong cultivation, how did you …”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He wanted to know what the celestial Thearch had experienced back then. With the eternal universe heavenly Emperor’s cultivation base, how had he fallen?</p><p>“You want to ask me why 1 died, right?”</p><p>“Speaking of which, 1 didn’t die!” The celestial Thearch’s figure smiled.</p><p>“He didn’t die?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed, but he was immediately filled with doubts. The celestial Thearch had not fallen. How could he have left behind a physical body and a trace of his mark?</p><p>I have to start from the evil god tribe!</p><p>The figure of the heavenly Emperor said. Immediately, the figure of the heavenly Emperor began to tell Lu Ming in detail.</p><p>In ancient times, the foreign races invaded the heaven realm and fought with the powerful beings of the heaven realm.</p><p>At that time, heaven and earth had been pierced through, connecting to the primordial realm.</p><p>There were many heaven realm ruins that fell into the primordial realm, and some strong practitioners from the heaven realm entered the primordial realm.</p><p>Of course, there were also some strong practitioners from other races who had entered the primordial realm.</p><p>However, only a small number of foreign powerhouses entered the primordial realm.</p><p>Later on, these alien experts hid in the primordial realm. There were even strange and terrifying races that possessed human bodies and established their own forces.</p><p>Forces like the demon spirit religion and evil spirit religion specialized in hunting down human elites and powerhouses.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew the origin of the evil spirit cult. It was created by an alien race. No wonder many of the evil spirit cultivators were afraid of his prison suppressing stele, just like the three-eyed God.</p><p>A long time ago, the alien races found a weak point in space and wanted to open a passage to let the evil god race in. However, they were discovered by the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor. In order to stop these alien races, a war broke out between the two sides.</p><p>However, there was a terrifying expert among the foreign races who was good at attacking the soul. He was also a heavenly Emperor, and he even tore the soul of the eternal universe heavenly Emperor apart.</p><p>Although the eternal universe heavenly Emperor had managed to kill his opponent in the end, his soul was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>In the end, the eternal universe heavenly Emperor used his remaining power to seal the eight emperors into a small world. He used the power of the small world and his own physical strength to suppress the passage.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood the origin of the Lotus World.</p><p>however, although my soul was scattered back then and only a wisp of my soul remained, when I was about to die, 1 had a great enlightenment and broke through to another level. Instead, 1 formed a new physical body and came back to life!</p><p>“So, I can be considered someone who has died once!”</p><p>Finally, the heavenly Emperor’s figure said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
