However, the other party was a teacher of the yuan mountain Saint Academy, which was founded by three great emperors. Although the Heng family was powerful, they did not dare to go against the yuan mountain Saint Academy.</p><p>The eyes of the Heng family’s true emperors turned and they started to discuss this matter.</p><p>After a while, a true Emperor from the Heng clan said,” “Lu Ming, you can keep the celestial Emperor’s sword, but you must hand over the cultivation technique in the sword to the Heng family!”</p><p>A sharp glint flashed across Xing Chen’s eyes.</p><p>He had once declared that the celestial Thearch’s sword would be his personal sword. Now, he was letting Lu Ming stay. This made him very unhappy.</p><p>The eyes of the teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Academy flickered. It was obvious that the Heng family had given in. They looked at Lu Ming and one of them said,” “Lu Ming, what do you think?”</p><p>there’s no cultivation technique in the sword. How am 1 supposed to hand it over?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After he pulled out the celestial Emperor’s sword, he did not notice any abnormalities at all. It was just like an ordinary stone sword. It only appeared in the sword tomb of its own accord and saved Lu Ming once. Moreover, it also absorbed a large amount of sword source.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t push your luck. The Heng family has already given in. If you’re too greedy, you’ll only be digging your own grave!</p><p>Xing He shouted coldly.</p><p>The eyes of the Heng family’s true emperors also flashed with cold light.</p><p>In their opinion, they had already given in, but Lu Ming was insatiable and was not even willing to hand over the celestial Thearch’s sword technique.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the cultivation technique in the celestial Emperor’s sword is very important to the Heng family!” He said.</p><p>that’s right. Young people should know when to stop. You are very talented. It would be a pity if you die halfway!</p><p>The few true emperors from the Heng family spoke one after another. Their threat was obvious.</p><p>“I said, there is no cultivation technique in the sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated.</p><p>“You still dare to deny it!”</p><p>One of the Heng family’s true emperors shouted. It was like a thunderclap. The sound of Rolling Thunder formed a terrifying storm that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy frowned. He took a step forward and a wave of power rushed out, destroying the thunderous sound of the other party.</p><p>“The true Emperor has made his move. He’s gone too far!”</p><p>The teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy frowned and looked at Lu Ming. “Lu Ming, you really didn’t get any cultivation technique from the sword?”</p><p>no, after 1 got that sword, there was nothing unusual about it. It was just like an ordinary stone sword!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you’re lying. There are records in the Heng family’s ancient books that the celestial Emperor’s sword has cultivation techniques left behind by the celestial Emperor. How can it not be there? ”</p><p>A true Emperor from the Heng clan shouted.</p><p>it looks like that sword really doesn’t belong to the Heng family. Or perhaps, the Heng family isn’t the descendant of the celestial Emperor at all!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>how dare you insult my Heng family! Kill without mercy!</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor was enraged, and a terrifying aura erupted from him as he stepped forward.</p><p>The Heng family had always been proud of being the descendants of the heavenly Emperor. Now that Lu Ming actually said that the Heng family was not the descendant of the heavenly Emperor, it was the greatest insult to the Heng family.</p><p>If he didn’t kill them, it would be hard to establish his prestige.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this time, an old voice came from the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>This voice was extremely gentle to the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. However, to the true emperors of the Heng clan, it was like thunder.</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor’s body trembled as he retreated frantically. His expression changed drastically, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood. “Great emperor!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s true Emperor said in shock.</p><p>“It’s Emperor formless!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the others heard this, they immediately knew that it was the great emperor notionless. When the great emperor notionless had lectured them earlier, they had naturally recognized his voice.</p><p>This matter had actually drawn the attention of Emperor formless.</p><p>“This is the yuan mountain sacred Academy. You guys can leave!”</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice rang out once more. Although he didn’t use any harsh words, it still gave off a Supreme dignity and unquestionable authority.</p><p>The three true emperors from the Heng clan had ugly expressions.</p><p>But this was the yuan mountain sacred Academy, and since Emperor Wu Xiang had spoken, how could they not retreat?</p><p>A true Emperor might be high and mighty in the eyes of other cultivators, but in front of a great emperor, they were like babies, trembling in fear.</p><p>“Wu Xiang!”</p><p>At this moment, outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy, an old voice came from an unknown distance.</p><p>Hearing this voice, the three true emperors of the Heng clan were overjoyed. They couldn’t help but shout,” “Forefather!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The three true emperors of the Heng clan addressed him as ‘old ancestor’, and since he dared to call Emperor formless by his name, there was only one possibility-he was also a great emperor.</p><p>There had always been rumors that the Heng family had a great emperor. It seemed like it was true.</p><p>Wuxiang, the celestial Emperor’s sword is related to an important legacy technique of the Heng family. Are you really going to interfere? ”</p><p>Outside the sacred Institute, the voice rang out again.</p><p>no matter what the reason is, since this is the yuan mountain sacred Academy and Lu Ming is a disciple of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, 1 will protect him. If it were any other disciple of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, I would do the same. If someone touches the eternal Star River in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, I will do the same!</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice was firm and unquestionable.</p><p>As long as they were in the yuan mountain sacred Academy and were disciples of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, he would protect them no matter who they were.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family sneered and said,”Wu Xiang, you and 1 haven’t seen each other for many years. I don’t know how much progress you’ve made. Why don’t we exchange some pointers!”</p><p>“That’s what I was thinking. 1 also want to see how much you’ve improved!”</p><p>Emperor formless retorted.</p><p>The hearts of many trembled. The two great sovereigns were about to fight. This was a rare event.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>From the direction of the Heng family and the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, a terrifying pressure spread out at the same time. Then, two rays of light flashed and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Wherever the light passed, the space would crack open and two figures would rush into the void crack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying vibration came out of the spatial crack. The entire sky seemed to be shaking crazily. A heavy pressure came from the sky, making people feel that the world was about to collapse and be destroyed.</p><p>The great emperors were fighting in the void.</p><p>If the great emperors fought directly in heavenly Emperor City, the world would be turned upside down. Heavenly Emperor City would suffer a destructive disaster and countless people would be affected.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the void, there was a constant rumble, and the space fluctuated like water. Then, a series of ferocious spatial cracks appeared in the void, like a spider web, densely covering the entire void.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Many people felt their hearts beat faster and their muscles tighten. They were extremely nervous.</p><p>It was too terrifying. Even though they were fighting in the void, the scene was still earth-shaking. Everyone had a feeling that a great disaster was coming.</p><p>A great Emperor’s little world could give birth to living beings and control great DAOs. It was simply too powerful. In front of it, true emperors were as weak as babies.</p><p>In this era where there were no heavenly emperors, great emperors were the peak existences of the world and no one could defeat them.</p><p>Every person’s appearance would attract the attention of the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
