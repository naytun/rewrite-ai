How’s his strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the violent ape mountain is inhabited by a type of ancient violent ape. They are warlike by nature, have infinite strength, and are extremely powerful in battle!</p><p>the most powerful violent ape in the violent ape mountain is at the quasi-Emperor realm. There are many violent apes at the absolute Saint realm below it. Some time ago, several alliances tried to explore the violent ape mountain, but they were all killed by the violent ape.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained.</p><p>“A violent ape at the Emperor-to-be realm?”</p><p>Many people’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>With the protection of the Emperor-to-be violent ape, it was indeed not easy to obtain a formation disk.</p><p>But fortunately, this was the battlefield of the Saints, the world of formations. Even if he died in this world, his real body would be fine.</p><p>“Ouyang, you lead the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming told Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded and led the way, followed by the rest.</p><p>The absolute Saint battlefield was vast and boundless. They flew for a few hours before a mountain that pierced through the clouds appeared in front of them.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Even from far away, one could hear the roars and howls, which were filled with brutal intent.</p><p>They had arrived at the violent ape mountain.</p><p>wait a moment. Those with weak cultivation will stay outside and attract some of the violent apes ‘attention. Those with strong cultivation will follow me and charge up the mountain!</p><p>Lu Ming assigned tasks to everyone.</p><p>In the absolute Saint battlefield, if one died in battle, they wouldn’t really die. Thus, using people with weaker cultivation to attract a portion of the violent apes was the best strategy.</p><p>No one had any objections, and they all headed towards the mountain together. “Someone’s coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed and he looked in another direction.</p><p>In that direction, a group of people was flying over.</p><p>The group flying at the very front were all young men and women in white robes, and they were extremely handsome.</p><p>“Thankyou, nianjun!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes. He was a little surprised.</p><p>He didn’t expect to see Xie nianjun here.</p><p>it’s the ancient Saint clan!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said softly.</p><p>The ancient Saint clan was a powerful ancient clan.</p><p>Those extremely handsome men and women in white robes were the members of the ancient Saint clan.</p><p>And the people behind the ancient Saint clan should be the elites of the Alliance with the ancient Saint clan.</p><p>It was obvious that the ancient Saint tribe also wanted to go up the mountain and take the array disc.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianjun looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming and the rest!”</p><p>The other ancient Saint clans, as well as the geniuses who were not from the ancient Saint clans, all looked serious.</p><p>The combat strength of Lu Ming’s group had left a deep impression on them. Now that they were together, it would be difficult for them to seize the array disc.</p><p>hehe, Lu Ming, i didn’t expect to meet you at the yuan mountain sacred Academy. What a coincidence!</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>Xie nianqing had helped him once in the Cang region and revealed the deity’s cultivation level and secrets before the battle.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had a bad impression of Xie nianjun. Back in the divine wilderness continent, the two of them were mortal enemies.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming and then at Xie nianjun in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianjun knew each other?</p><p>“I’m really impressed. How does Lu Ming know so many beautiful women? Logically speaking, I’m quite handsome too. Why don’t I know so many beautiful women?”</p><p>Desolate li touched his head and muttered.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, Luo Tianyi, and the other women all had a strange look on their faces.</p><p>As for the other big guys from the desolate race, they looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled, seemingly unconcerned with Lu Ming’s attitude.”Lu Ming, you’re here to take the array disc too?”</p><p>“I’ve naturally come here to seize the formation plate!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>what a coincidence, we’re also here for the formation plate. Since I helped you once before, how about you give me the formation plate? ”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“Give it to you? There are Emperor-to-be violent apes on the violent ape mountain. Even if I give them to you, I’m afraid you won’t be able to take them down. Let’s just rely on our own abilities!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stopped talking to Xie nianjun. They flew to the other side of the violent ape mountain.</p><p>If the ancient Saint clan wanted to take the array disc, then so be it. The two parties would attack the mountain from different directions. Whoever could get it would be the one who had the ability.</p><p>They went to the other side of the mountain and acted according to their original plan.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones rushed towards the mountain.</p><p>Not long after, a series of angry roars could be heard from the violent ape mountain. A group of violent apes chased after those people and disappeared into the distance.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to send a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Bubbles waved her small hands and a spacetime tunnel formed, extending to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>&Nbsp; everyone charged into the spacetime tunnel.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, a terrifying roar came from the top of the mountain. A huge violent ape appeared. It was at least 100 meters tall. It held a huge stick in its hand and swept it toward the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>&Nbsp; as the giant stick swept through, the world rumbled, and the spacetime tunnel shattered.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group had just stepped into the space-time Tunnel and had not crossed half the distance when they were forcefully thrown out of the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>sure enough, it doesn’t work. The strength of an Emperor-to-be is really amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was indeed powerful. The moment bubbles opened the space-time Tunnel, he was discovered and the space-time Tunnel was destroyed in one fell swoop. His plan of using the space-time Tunnel to reach the mountaintop in one go was ruined.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be giant ape stood on the peak of the mountain and roared.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The entire violent ape mountain was in an uproar. Loud roars could be heard as violent apes appeared one after another. Some were unarmed, some were holding metal rods, and some were grabbing huge rocks as they charged towards Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>From a distance away, huge rocks the size of houses were smashing toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and everyone rushed to the mountain peak at top speed.</p><p>While they were attacking, bubbles pressed her small hand gently. The space in front of her rippled, and those giant rocks were crushed into pieces by the space power.</p><p>Then, the violent apes rushed over.</p><p>Bubbles spat out a bunch of bubbles from her small mouth and enveloped the giant apes. Lu Ming and the rest took action one after another and killed the giant apes.</p><p>The moment these giant apes died, they turned into energy and disappeared.</p><p>Those who followed Lu Ming were Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, Luo Tianyi, Long Chen, desolate li, Ouyang Wushuang, Luo Xiang, Lu Ming, and bubbles. There were a total of nine people, and they were all absolute Saints. They were all above the king body, and with their cooperation, their speed was shocking.</p><p>No matter if it was a lower-tier absolute Saint or a perfected absolute Saint, they were all killed instantly.</p><p>They were like a sharp knife, rushing to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>On the other side of the mountain, a series of rumbling sounds could be heard. Clearly, the ancient Saint clan had also begun their attack.</p><p>it’s good that the ancient Saint tribe is here. They can help us attract a group of violent apes!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile.</p><p>The others also smiled.</p><p>That was indeed the case. With the ancient Saint tribe attacking the mountain, the violent ape on the other side had been attracted, and the pressure on them had been reduced by a lot.</p><p>Within a few minutes, Lu Ming and the rest were approaching the peak of the mountain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
