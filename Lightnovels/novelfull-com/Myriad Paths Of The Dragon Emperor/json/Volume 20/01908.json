He would not admit it. He had to listen to Lu Ming’s orders now.</p><p>Since the death blade did not mention it, Lu Ming naturally would not say it either.</p><p>“Death blade, it’s still too early for you to stop me with your current cultivation!”</p><p>Said Xing Chen coldly.</p><p>Death blade’s cultivation was at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, while he was in the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>The death blade was no match for him.</p><p>“How would we know if we don’t fight?”</p><p>The death blade said, and the death energy around him became even thicker.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll grant you your wish!”</p><p>Xing Chen shouted coldly. The eternal divine light became more and more brilliant. The peerless sword radiance was incomparably sharp. It was flickering and could erupt into a terrifying attack at any time.</p><p>“Stellar River, our battle isn’t over yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. At this moment, his black hair and eyes turned blood-red, and a bone-chilling murderous intent emanated from his body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have turned into a god of death.</p><p>This was the power of the third bloodline!</p><p>It had been a long time since Lu Ming had used the power of the third bloodline. The power of the third bloodline was too strange, and Lu Ming had been using it less and less.</p><p>But today, he had no choice but to use it.</p><p>After borrowing the power of the third bloodline, Lu Ming’s aura rose sharply.</p><p>After a few steps, Lu Ming stood side by side with the death blade.</p><p>attack! Hit this guy! Chirp chirp!</p><p>Pao Pao mumbled. She strode forward with her small feet and followed Lu Ming. As her figure walked past, the void distorted like water ripples. It was as if her body was not here but in another space-time.</p><p>In addition, Qiu Yue, Luo Tianyi, and the others also stepped forward, exuding a shocking aura.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blade of death was the first to attack. The blade of death slashed toward the star River. Wherever the blade light passed, the world became silent. It was deathly still.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was the second to make a move. He lifted the Dayan elixir furnace, and a majestic force continuously surged into the furnace, smashing it toward the Galaxy.</p><p>Then, bubbles, Qiu Yue, and the rest attacked at the same time.</p><p>The attack this time was truly shocking.</p><p>today, I’ll let you all understand what it means to be the strongest!</p><p>The eternal Star River howled and the sword beams kept slashing out. Hundreds of sword beams were slashing toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The death blade’s blade of death kept shaking, and more and more blade lights appeared. He managed to block a small part of the sword light.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace in Lu Ming’s hand was as huge as a mountain. Every time it fell, a large area of sword radiance was destroyed.</p><p>Bubbles, Qiu Yue, and the rest worked together to block the remaining sword light.</p><p>boom! boom! boom!</p><p>A terrifying battle erupted. The ten geniuses fought with all their might. This entire region was filled with terrifying rumbling sounds. The entire Yuan mountain sacred Academy was shocked.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming used his third bloodline and the death blade joined in, they could finally fight against the eternal Star River and not be at a disadvantage.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves, but there was still no clear winner.</p><p>Xing Chen unleashed his terrifying combat strength to the extreme, but he could not do anything to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The advantage of the Galaxy was cultivation. His cultivation was on the higher side.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s group had more people. The combination of various different laws was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>In the midst of the battle, Lu Ming opened the lid of the Dayan elixir furnace. A powerful devouring force erupted from the furnace, trying to swallow the star River.</p><p>The eternal Star River howled and eternal divine light burst forth, tearing apart the pill furnace’s devouring force. However, the next moment, it was enveloped by the bubble’s space-time law and its body froze.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The death blade’s blade of death slashed over and almost hit the eternal Star River. He dodged it by a hair’s breadth and broke through the attacks of Qiu Yue and the others at the same time. He slashed out a few terrifying sword lights at Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, and the others.</p><p>However, the bubble’s space-time law enveloped Qiu Yue and the rest. Their bodies trembled and they dodged the sword radiance of the Xingxing River.</p><p>Bubbles ‘spacetime law had great support abilities in a battle. Furthermore, its attack power was also very terrifying, making it impossible to guard against.</p><p>As time passed, the battle became even more intense. On the battlefield, all kinds of dazzling lights burst out, colliding with each other and causing continuous rumbles.</p><p>After about a hundred moves, there was still no clear winner.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heng Xinghe, Lu Ming, and the death blade collided with each other and their bodies flew far away.</p><p>His face was particularly gloomy.</p><p>Today’s matter seemed to be out of his control.</p><p>He was only dealing with one Lu Ming, but he was besieged by so many people. Every one of them was a terrifying genius.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you, the Heng family is determined to get the celestial Emperor’s sword. You can’t protect it with just your people!”</p><p>Said Xing Chen coldly.</p><p>that’s right. The Heng family must obtain the celestial Emperor’s sword!</p><p>As the voice of the Xingxing River faded, another voice rang out from outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Following that, a suffocating pressure spread out from that direction.</p><p>Then, the crowd saw three old men Walking in the Air.</p><p>The three elders were surrounded by a divine light.</p><p>Many people’s pupils contracted. This was the world God light, which meant that the three elders were all true Emperor level experts.</p><p>The three elders stood in the air, surrounded by the world’s divine light. They were like three gods, and a terrifying pressure constantly spread out. All the geniuses present felt like a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>“Elder!”</p><p>Xing Chen cupped his fists at the three old men.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword to us. It’s the celestial Emperor’s sword. You’re not qualified to control it!”</p><p>The elder in the middle spoke and looked at Lu Ming. Lu Ming felt a strong pressure on his body, and he could not help but step back.</p><p>“If the younger one can’t do it, then the older one will? This is indeed the style of a great power!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a hint of mockery.</p><p>“That’s right. You true emperors want to meddle in the affairs of the younger generation. It’s too embarrassing!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>As the voice faded, a few figures appeared in the void.</p><p>These figures were all surrounded by world divine light and were all at the true Emperor level.</p><p>This was a teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Many of the teachers in the yuan mountain sacred Academy didn’t come from any major powers. Most of them were lone wolves or lived in seclusion. In the end, they were invited by the three great emperors to become teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy and manage it together.</p><p>The expressions of the Heng family’s true emperors turned ugly.</p><p>Initially, they had asked the star River to take the celestial Emperor’s sword from Lu Ming’s hands. However, they did not expect that the star River would not succeed. They had no choice but to step in.</p><p>They had also thought that the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy would definitely interfere in this matter.</p><p>“This is the yuan mountain sacred Academy. You guys can go ahead!”</p><p>A teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy directly asked him to leave, the celestial Emperor’s sword, we must take it away!</p><p>A true Emperor from the Heng clan spoke.</p><p>the celestial Emperor’s sword was pulled out by Lu Ming, so it naturally belongs to him. You guys don’t have the ability to pull it out, but you want to gain something for nothing. Isn’t that ridiculous? to think that you guys call yourselves the descendants of the celestial Emperor!</p><p>An old man said in disdain, not giving the Heng family any face at all..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
