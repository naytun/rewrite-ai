How did he die?</p><p>This was the heavenly Emperor, an unrivaled existence. Who could kill him?</p><p>Could he also be a heavenly Emperor?</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were filled with questions.</p><p>“You’re here for my physical body, right?”</p><p>The celestial Thearch spoke again.</p><p>Everyone’s face turned pale. Now that the mark of the celestial Emperor had appeared, they didn’t dare to tell the truth. Even if the celestial Emperor only had a wisp of the mark left, he could kill them with a single thought.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. The Galaxy did not say anything either.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s Mark’s gaze eventually landed on Lu Ming and the Galaxy. “The two of you are somewhat related to me. If you want to force your way forward, I won’t stop you!”</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes lit up and he cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s Mark. It was said that Lu Ming was related to the celestial Thearch’s Mark. He could not help but think of the celestial Thearch’s sword.</p><p>I’m a descendant of the celestial Emperor. This Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is mine!</p><p>The Galaxy roared in its heart.</p><p>but 1 have to remind you!</p><p>At this moment, the celestial Emperor’s Mark continued to speak, but its expression became very serious, since you’ve made it this far, I won’t stop you. As long as you step forward, you’ll be able to obtain the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. However, this will cause great changes. The people in Yuan mountain will be plunged into misery and suffering, and blood will flow like rivers. Countless people will die, including your family and friends!</p><p>a single thought can affect the life and death of countless people. You have to consider this carefully!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed!</p><p>&Nbsp; if he went forward, he would cause great changes. The people would be in misery and blood would flow like rivers. Even his friends and family would be affected.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>Not only him, but the other people’s faces also changed greatly. The celestial Emperor’s Mark wouldn’t do anything without a purpose. All kinds of thoughts flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>“I’ll give you ten breaths to consider. If you don’t come forward, then retreat!”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor’s Mark said.</p><p>Lu Ming did not think too much. He shook his head slightly and retreated.</p><p>He had cultivated his entire life with the thought of reaching the peak of martial Dao, but more than that, he wanted to possess great strength to decide his own fate and protect his family and friends.</p><p>If the celestial Thearch’s physical body put his family and friends in danger and the people in misery, Lu Ming would rather not have it.</p><p>This was not his path of martial arts!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated, but the Galaxy stepped forward.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s Mark asked.</p><p>“What does the life and death of others have to do with me? As long as I can reach the peak and become eternal, everything will be worth it!”</p><p>Xinghe’s indifferent voice sounded.</p><p>In his heart, he only cared about himself. Any other life or death, even if it was the life or death of his loved ones, was worth it as long as it could help him. “You’ll never be successful if you are selfish!”</p><p>In the crowd, Huang Ling said hatefully.</p><p>“But this kind of person is also very terrifying!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi said.</p><p>This kind of person only thought about himself and did things unscrupulously. It was indeed terrifying.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Xing Chen continued to step forward, his body becoming faster and faster. He seemed to be attracted by a mysterious force as he flew towards the stone man at an extreme speed.</p><p>The next moment, the body of the star River actually directly entered the body of the stone man and disappeared.</p><p>Al!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s Mark sighed in disappointment. Then, its body collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura rippled from the giant stone man. Wisps of faint light emanated from the stone man’s body.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The next moment, the golem seemed to move, and a cracking sound rang out.</p><p>“What’s going on? Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is moving, I’m not seeing things, right?”</p><p>“He’s indeed moving. His arm is moving. My God, how can the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body move?”</p><p>could it be the star River? he has merged into Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body and is controlling it!</p><p>Someone shouted in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed abruptly. He retreated rapidly and shouted,” “Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body exploded with a terrifying aura.</p><p>This aura was as vast as the heavens and was impossible to predict. It was like the heavenly Dao that was impossible to resist.</p><p>This was the pressure of a Celestial Emperor!</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body’s eyes looked in Lu Ming’s direction, filled with a cold and indifferent light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, today is the day you die!”</p><p>A voice came from the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. It was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>It was the sound of the Galaxy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was very gloomy. He did not expect that he would merge into the celestial Thearch’s physical body and control it.</p><p>He had thought that he would only get it.</p><p>If he had known this earlier, he would have stopped the star River even if he didn’t want the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body.</p><p>At this moment, he could only retreat!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated hastily. So did Huang Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t escape!”</p><p>The voice of the Galaxy sounded again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body suddenly stood up, and an unimaginably terrifying aura burst out, enveloping the entire ninth world.</p><p>Everyone was unable to move under this force, including Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have heard a terrifying roar erupting from his third Blood Meridian. It seemed to be very unhappy, but it seemed to be suppressed by a powerful force. Only Lu Ming could hear the roar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still far from being my match!”</p><p>The voice of the eternal Star River was heard again. The celestial Thearch’s physical body stood in the air, as high as the sky. A terrifying aura constantly spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the celestial Thearch’s physical body stretched out a large hand and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>The giant hand covered the sky and was so powerful that it was impossible to escape or resist.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others were shocked, and their faces were very ugly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s face was filled with surprise.</p><p>Because at this moment, in his sea of consciousness, the celestial Emperor’s sword was shaking crazily, and it was suffused with mysterious light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, the celestial Emperor’s sword rushed out of his sea of consciousness and hovered above Lu Ming’s head. It was also rapidly growing in size.</p><p>Soon, an extremely huge sword appeared, and the aura it gave off was just as shocking.</p><p>“That is … That’s the celestial Emperor’s sword!”</p><p>Many people shouted in shock.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword had appeared. Could it be that it was going to fight against the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body?</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>With a single thought, the celestial Thearch’s sword slashed out violently at the palm of the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion erupted, and the entire world was shaking.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically. Their bodies trembled and they staggered back with blood flowing from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>After the sound of the collision, the celestial Emperor’s sword flew back and hovered above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s massive corporeal body also took a few steps back.</p><p>“The celestial Emperor’s sword is mine. I’m the descendant of the celestial Emperor. Lu Ming, what right do you have to wield the celestial Emperor’s sword? give it to me!”</p><p>The eternal Star River bellowed and controlled the celestial Thearch’s physical body. It stepped on the void and charged toward Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
