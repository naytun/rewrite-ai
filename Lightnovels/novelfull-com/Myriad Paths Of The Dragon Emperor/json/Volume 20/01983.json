All kinds of terrifying attacks bombarded the celestial Emperor’s body.</p><p>“Hengyu, not killing me that year was your biggest mistake!”</p><p>today, 1 will tear your body apart!</p><p>Those powerful living beings had been suppressed for countless years. When they saw the celestial Emperor’s body, they were filled with brutal intent and endless killing intent. Their eyes were red as they unleashed terrifying attacks.</p><p>Although these beings had been suppressed for countless years and their combat power had been greatly reduced, they were still great emperor realm beings. Their strength was still significant.</p><p>After all, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was just a corporeal body.</p><p>Many people joined forces, and all kinds of attacks landed on the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, forcing it to retreat.</p><p>However, even though the celestial Emperor’s body had retreated, there was not a single wound on its stone body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone sword trembled, and the stone man burst with a brilliant light. At this moment, the celestial Emperor’s physical body seemed to have recovered.</p><p>The stone sword streaked across the sky, and sword light burst forth. The expressions of several powerful existences changed drastically as they were sent flying by the sword.</p><p>At this moment, the space in that area cracked open again, and more experts stepped out to join in the attack on the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>“Kill our way out!”</p><p>“Wash the primordial realm with blood!”</p><p>Behind the vortex, there were constant roars. The killing intent was like a tide, making people’s faces change.</p><p>The massive three-eyed God was doing everything it could to keep the vortex up, trying to make it bigger.</p><p>There were a total of ten great emperors attacking the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. Everyone’s faces turned ugly at the sight.</p><p>Ten great emperors, what a shocking number. The number of great emperors in the yuan mountain sacred land didn’t even add up to ten.</p><p>Many of them had a serious look on their faces. If the heavenly Emperor couldn’t stop the alien races, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s physical body glowed brighter and brighter. At this moment, his stone-like body seemed to be transforming into a body of flesh and blood. His combat strength was also becoming more and more terrifying.</p><p>The stone sword flew across the sky and blocked the attacks of the ten great emperors.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this time, the space kept cracking open. Emperor formless, Emperor Heng, emperor he, and the great emperors of the Daluo heaven sect all appeared. They all had serious expressions on their faces as they joined the battle to help the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body resist the great emperors.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a helper, the pressure on the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body was greatly reduced. He shouted, and the stone sword broke through several attacks in a row. He rushed to the front of the giant lizard and slashed out with the stone sword.</p><p>At this moment, the stone sword seemed to have turned into an indestructible divine object. It was extremely sharp and cut off one of the giant lizard’s tails.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant lizard roared and retreated frantically.</p><p>At the same time, the attacks of the other powerhouses landed on the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. However, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body could not be bothered at all. It was as if there was only the giant lizard in his eyes.</p><p>The attacks landed on the celestial Emperor’s body, causing it to shake for a moment before it continued to attack the giant lizard.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword light pierced through the void and entered the giant lizard’s glabella, sinking into the hilt.</p><p>“Hengyu, roar!”</p><p>The giant lizard let out a roar of despair, but in the next moment, the celestial Thearch’s physical combat sword sliced the giant lizard’s body in half. Endless blood and flesh were sucked into the two worlds and disappeared.</p><p>A great emperor had been killed by the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body just like that.</p><p>Of course, this was also related to the fact that the giant lizard had been suppressed for many years and had yet to recover its strength. However, it was still shocking enough.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body went berserk as he attacked the others. After a few moves, he killed another powerful existence.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had killed two powerful enemies in a row. This was shocking.</p><p>Every single one of them was a great emperor. They were at the peak of their power and were terrifying to the extreme, but now, they had all fallen one after another.</p><p>there’s not much energy left in his physical body. He only has a wisp of mark left, so it’s difficult for him to mobilize the heavenly Dao energy. If we attack him together, he won’t be able to hold on for long!</p><p>The devil spirit religion master roared. Their attacks continued to bombard Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>The battle between Emperor formless and the others was also very intense.</p><p>All kinds of power flashed, and the great Dao was added to his body. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>Fortunately, the space near the world of the lotus flower was special. Although Lu Ming and the rest looked like they were not far from the world of the lotus flower, they were actually very far away. Otherwise, they would definitely have been implicated by the aftermath of the great Emperor’s battle.</p><p>Even so, it was still shocking to see.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The shockwaves from the clash between great emperors were too great. The nine lotus petals, which were Nine Worlds, shook violently as if they were about to explode under the terrifying energy.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A jet-black destructive light burst forth and swept through one of the worlds. The space of that world was torn apart. Even though Lu Ming and the rest were far away, they could see that countless people in that world were destroyed by the destructive power and turned into ashes.</p><p>“Ten thousand sea realm …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the ten thousand seas realm. The realm was also shaking violently. If it was pierced through, the people inside would be in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a worried look.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body exploded, and the light became even more resplendent. He launched a storm-like attack and seriously injured another powerful existence.</p><p>However, the aura of the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body began to weaken.</p><p>“In the end, it’s too difficult to turn back!”</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body shook his head. Then, he threw out the stone sword, which turned into thousands of sword lights and attacked those existences. His corporeal body instantly split into eight and became even larger.</p><p>Each figure carried a petal and flew toward the endless void.</p><p>Only the Ninth World had no one, so he didn’t care.</p><p>Finally, the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body carried the eight worlds and charged into the boundless void.</p><p>“Heavenly flood Dragon, take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Even though worlds like the ten thousand sea realm might never cross paths with the primordial realm after entering the vast void, they could at least survive.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the vortex was slowly expanding. Then, a dense number of figures rushed out from it.</p><p>These figures were all very burly. Each of them was covered in pitch-black scales and had a third eye in the middle of their brows.</p><p>“Three-eyed God race, they’re all three-eyed God race!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>These figures were almost identical to the three-eyed God that Lu Ming had seen before.</p><p>Some of the three-eyed God race were riding on mutant beasts, while others were flying through the air. All of them had powerful auras, but the moment they charged out, they were crushed into pieces by the auras of the great emperors.</p><p>“Kill them and let the Army in!”</p><p>The demon spirit religion master shouted, and the remaining eight Emperor-level experts madly attacked Emperor Wu Xiang and the others. “Let’s get out of here!”</p><p>Some people were scared witless as they flew towards the sky above the cave.</p><p>At this moment, two shadows flashed. Two figures appeared near Lu Ming and the others, each of them exuding a shocking fluctuation.</p><p>It was the aura of a great emperor!</p><p>A great emperor expert had arrived.</p><p>this isn’t a place for you to stay. Hurry up and leave. Return to the yuan mountain sacred Academy and then leave heavenly Emperor City!</p><p>One of the elders, whose body was covered in terrifying flames, said. Then, he waved his hand. Lu Ming and the rest felt a powerful force surging towards them. In the next moment, they flew out of the underground cave and appeared outside the cave..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
