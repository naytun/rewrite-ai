The sword light slashed, and everyone retreated quickly.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The hearts of the surrounding people trembled.</p><p>The Galaxy was too powerful. Even when Lu Ming and the other seven experts joined forces, they were still no match for it.</p><p>the cultivation of Xing Xing River is at least at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. With the eternal body, his combat power is too strong!</p><p>Long Chen said to the others.</p><p>That was indeed the case. Their cultivation levels were too much weaker, and they were simply no match for him.</p><p>He was the eternal Son, an invincible existence at the same level as them. Not to mention, his cultivation base was much higher than theirs.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword. You’re not qualified to wield it!”</p><p>Said Xing Chen coldly.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, your cultivation level is just slightly higher. If we were to fight at the same level, I would still defeat you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Defeat me? Hehe, Lu Ming, let me tell you, even if you have mastered the Laws of Chaos, you are no match for me in a battle of the same level!”</p><p>however, you don’t have to provoke me into fighting you at the same level. Having a high cultivation is also a kind of strength!</p><p>As Xingxing River spoke, he stepped forward. A terrifying sword will burst out of his body, piercing through the sky.</p><p>The sword power spread out in all directions, forming a terrifying pressure.</p><p>He had overwhelming abilities. Why did he have to fight with Lu Ming at the same level?</p><p>This kind of goading had no effect on him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you don’t want to hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword, I’ll have to take it myself!”</p><p>Xing Chen said coldly. He raised the sword light in his hand high and his aura became stronger and stronger.</p><p>However, at this moment, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared on the Galaxy and enveloped him.</p><p>space-time law!</p><p>Xinghe’s expression changed and he shouted in anger.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He knew that bubbles had made a move. Moreover, from the fluctuations of the space-time law, it was extremely powerful. Clearly, bubbles had also broken through to the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Once again, Lu Ming and the other seven joined forces and launched a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A terrifying sword radiance burst forth from the body of the star River, breaking the transparent bubble in one go. However, the surrounding space kept on rippling and distorting like water waves, trying to trap the star River in the void.</p><p>At the same time, the power of time also acted on the Galaxy, causing his movements to slow down.</p><p>Xinghe’s expression finally changed a little.</p><p>The spacetime law was also one of the ten strongest laws. It had endless changes and was best at trapping enemies.</p><p>With the space-time law in coordination with Lu Ming and the rest, they would be able to unleash their abilities to a greater extent.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming’s group’s attack arrived. It looked like the Galaxy was about to be drowned in it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, an even more powerful and terrifying aura burst out from the body of the eternal Star River. A terrifying divine light burst out and the space-time law that enveloped his body collapsed instantly. The attacks of Lu Ming and the others were also crushed by the light.</p><p>“It’s the eternal light!”</p><p>also, Xing Xing river’s cultivation level is in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage!</p><p>Around them, many people shouted.</p><p>is this the true cultivation level of the Galaxy? ”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked extremely solemn.</p><p>In the battle just now, Xinghe had not used his full strength at all.</p><p>His cultivation had already reached the perfected absolute Saint realm. How terrifying was he at this age?</p><p>As long as his eternal law was perfected and he reached the perfection realm, he would be able to step into the Emperor-to-be realm and start to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>There were not many people who could reach the Martial Emperor realm before the age of 50, and they could be compared to the ancient mighty figures.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure flashed and bubbles appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder, that person is so strong. The bubbles can’t trap him. Chirp chirp!</p><p>very good, you’re not bad. You’re able to force me to use my full strength. Then, you’ll have to suffer my wrath!</p><p>Xing Chen spoke with a cold voice, revealing a cold killing intent.</p><p>A real combat sword appeared in his hand. It was a monarch weapon, and its sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>At that moment, Xing Chen’s cultivation in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm was completely unleashed. His aura was truly shocking.</p><p>it’s over. Lu Ming and the rest are finished. Although they are strong, they are no match for the Galaxy!</p><p>indeed, but Lu Ming’s lineup is too terrifying. There’s actually someone who has mastered the space-time law. How shocking will they be when they grow up?”</p><p>“Will the eternal Star River kill them and get rid of them here?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say!”</p><p>Today’s scene had far exceeded everyone’s expectations, making them so nervous that they found it hard to breathe.</p><p>In the beginning, Luo cangqiong came to find trouble with Lu Ming but was defeated by him. After that, the Xingxing River made their move and the number of experts on Lu Ming’s side continued to increase.</p><p>Up until now, there were already six King physiques and two sons of God. What kind of luxurious lineup was this?</p><p>This made many of the powerful heaven’s favorites look very serious.</p><p>If these people’s cultivation were to increase, who would be their match?</p><p>“Damn it, I hope the Galaxy can kill these people!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong was also shocked.</p><p>He had never expected that there would be so many terrifying geniuses gathered around Lu Ming.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>He took a step forward and his figure suddenly disappeared. In the next moment, a terrifying sword light slashed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The hearts of Lu Ming and the rest thumped rapidly. They could sense a terrifying danger from the sword light.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. They could only block this attack by gathering all their strength.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace flew out from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. In his dantian, the two Saint hearts were working at full force. Majestic Saint power poured into the Dayan elixir furnace, making it the size of a mountain.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming and the rest were about to go all out and fight, a pitch-black Saber Light cut through the void in the distance and slashed violently.</p><p>This blade light was filled with the aura of death, as if it wanted to kill all the living beings in the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword-light and the saber-light collided heavily and exploded. The terrifying sword Qi and saber-light swept in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure flashed. It was a young man in a black robe. He stepped forward and appeared in front of the star River. He was holding a saber in his arms, and his body was filled with a strong aura of death.</p><p>“It’s the death blade!”</p><p>the death blade actually attacked the Galaxy. Could it be that the death blade is also familiar with Lu Ming and the rest?!</p><p>Many people were shocked to see this young man.</p><p>The death blade, the son of death, had also attacked the Galaxy.</p><p>“Death blade, you’re going to help Lu Ming and the rest too?”</p><p>Xinghe’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a sharp glint flashed through them.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>no! the death blade shook his head, the reason I attacked was because I didn’t like you!</p><p>These words made many people speechless.</p><p>The death blade attacked because he didn’t like the Galaxy?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and the corners of his mouth curled into a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was a gold-tier inheritor of the Hunyuan sect while the death blade was a silver-tier inheritor. Naturally, he would not attack just because he did not like the eternal Star River..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
