Not long after, they finally arrived at the edge of heavenly Emperor City. They rushed out of rhe city walls and rushed towards a satellite city in the distance.</p><p>Not long after, they successfully arrived at a satellite city.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Even though they were far away, they could still hear the violent rumbles coming from the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>From the heavenly Emperor City, there were figures rushing out in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not stop and went to the teleportation array.</p><p>However, most of them did not follow Lu Ming and the rest. Instead, they returned to their respective sects.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 need to return to the shenyuan Empire first. The invasion of the foreign tribes is no small matter. The shenyuan Empire must make early preparations!11 He said.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang told Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, letrs go our separate ways. We’ll meet again if we have the chance, but you must stay alive!</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes were bright as he looked at the crowd.</p><p>“Definitely!’1</p><p>“Everyone must stay alive!”</p><p>“Take care, Alliance master!”</p><p>Everyone bade farewell to Lu Ming and stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>In the end, only the people from the ancient Moon Holy Land, Luo Xiang, Huang Li, and the others were left.</p><p>“Lets go!”</p><p>They also stepped into the teleportation array and teleported to the teleportation area outside ancient Moon Holy Land, then flew towards ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>After flying to ancient Moon sanctuary, Feng Ling, Long Chen, Luo Tianyi, ye Dongfang and the others all left and returned to their respective sects.</p><p>Right now, the various factions of the ancient Moon Holy Land had probably not received the news. They had to return as soon as possible to report and make early preparations.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming brought Xiangxiang Bella, Xue ningxin, the nine elites of the desolate race, and Luo Xiang back to the great Yan elixir Hall.</p><p>After returning to the great Yan elixir Palace and settling everyone down, Lu Ming looked for uncle Kong and told him about the three-eyed God race’s invasion in the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>the evil god tribe has invaded earlier than expected!</p><p>Uncle Kong sighed with a serious expression.</p><p>“The evil god clan? Uncle Kong, what are these three-eyed monsters?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. Uncle Kong’s cultivation level was unfathomable and he had lived for an unknown amount of time. He might know many secrets.</p><p>they come from another world and call themselves the three-eyed God race. However, that’s just an exaggeration. We call them the evil god race!</p><p>in the distant past, they attacked the heaven realm. For such a long time, most of the territories of the heaven realm were occupied. Now, they have always wanted to open the space barrier and invade the primordial realm!</p><p>Uncle Kong said with a serious expression. He didn’t seem to want to say more,”Lu Ming, your mission now is to cultivate in peace and raise your cultivation. You can’t interfere in such a big battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Even the heaven realm and the Hunyuan sect could not stop them. What could he use to stop them?</p><p>“That’s right, uncle Kong, can you help me save a person?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He then released Qiu Yue from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Until now, Qiu Yue was still unconscious. Uncle Kong’s cultivation was profound, and he was also The Guardian of the Dayan elixir Palace. He was proficient in alchemy, so there might be a way to save her.</p><p>Uncle Kong stepped forward and waved his hand. A wave of energy enveloped Qiu Yue. After a while, uncle Kong retracted the energy and frowned,</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank and he quickly asked, ” “Uncle Kong, how are Qiu Yue’s injuries?”</p><p>what an overbearing technique. She must have been hit by the law of deprivation!</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>that’s right. The person who attacked has mastered the law of deprivation!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>“The injuries on her body have basically healed, but her soul has been seriously injured!” Uncle Kong muttered.</p><p>“His soul is injured!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Injuries to the soul were the most difficult to heal.</p><p>that’s right. This girl’s soul has been attacked by rhe law of deprivation. She’s severely injured, which is why she hasn’t woken up yet. If she wants to wake up, she must condense her soul. Otherwise, she’ll never wake up!</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart trembled. Fie could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>It was possible that she would never wake up again!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s killing intent towards Luo cangqiong was extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.”Uncle Kong, is there any way to help Qiu Yue’s soul condense?”</p><p>Uncle Kong frowned as he pondered. After a long rime, he said, now, the only way is to put this girl into the Dayan elixir furnace and use the elixir fire to nurture her physical body. After a certain period of time, 1 will also need to add sacred medicine. This way, not only will it maintain the vitality of her physical body, but it will also prevent the remnants of her soul from dissipating. It can even slowly condense her soul!</p><p>but this method can only treat rhe symptoms but not the root of the problem. If we want to completely wake him up, we still need other methods!</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 do ir immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Dayan elixir furnace and put Qiu Yue in it. He controlled the elixir fire in the furnace and enveloped Qiu Yue’s body. Then, Lu Ming added some sacred medicine. The medicinal effect of the sacred medicine seeped into Qiu Yue’s body under rhe effect of the elixir fire.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, do you know of any other methods that can completely wake Qiu Yue up?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>Uncle Kong shook his head and said, ” I’ve been in seclusion for many years, so I don’t know much. Flowever, you can go to Vientiane rower and ask around. Perhaps you can find a way. This girl is in the great Yan pill furnace, so she wili be fine for hundreds of years. Don’t worry!</p><p>“Wan Xiang tower…”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart skipped a beat. It was a pity that the heavenly Emperor City was in chaos now. There was no way to ask for the time being.</p><p>Fortunately, Qiu Yue was fine for the time being. He could only slowly find a way in the future.</p><p>After chatting with uncle Kong for a while more, Lu Ming left.</p><p>Then, he brought Xiangxiang and called Ouyang Moli over to introduce him to them.</p><p>“Senior Sister!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli bowed to Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>In fact, Lu Xiangxiang was two years younger than Ouyang Moli. However, she put her hands behind her back and looked curious. She blinked her big eyes and sized Ouyang Moli up. She said in a mature tone,”You’re second Junior Brother? Your cultivation level isn’t good enough, so you have to work harder!’1</p><p>“Yes, Senior Sister!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli nodded.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang still had the appearance of an old woman. She nodded slightly, her eyes full of excitement.</p><p>She felt that the feeling of being rhe eldest Senior Sister was not bad!</p><p>Lu Ming found it funny. This girl was really putting on the demeanor of a Senior Sister.</p><p>Xiangxiang, don’t be too proud. Your second Junior Brother has only cultivated for two years and is about to break through to the Saint realm. If you don’t work hard, he might catch up to you!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a serious’ look.</p><p>“Less than two years? So fast?”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang blinked her big eyes. This speed was even faster than her.</p><p>Ouyang Moli had the reincarnation body and had even obtained the world core of the reincarnation Emperor. His cultivation speed was shockingly fast, even faster than Lu Xiangxiang. Coupled with the guidance of uncle Kong, his Foundation was extremely solid. He had already reached the peak of the half-Saint realm and was about to break through to the Saint realm.</p><p>This kind of cultivation speed was too shocking. It made him feel ashamed as a master.</p><p>However, Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were the true children of God, unlike Lu Ming, who had cultivated himself to this level. He was naturally gifted and it was normal for him to cultivate quickly in the early stages.</p><p>Towards the end, it would slowly slow down.</p><p>For example, Heng Xinghe had been stuck in rhe great circle of the absolute Saint stage for a year or two and had not broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“There are many heaven s favorites in the world, don’t be too proud! ”</p><p>Lu Ming warned seriously.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella and Ouyang Moli nodded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
