If that was the case, they might as well fight.</p><p>I’ve already said it back then. It seems that you don’t understand. Then today, I’ll say it again!</p><p>“Lu Ming is now in the sage state. If anyone below the rank of martial Supreme attacks him, the old man won’t care. It’s your ability that you can kill him!”</p><p>“If he corroborates his Dao and becomes an Emperor, then all of you at the void Emperor realm can make a move. If he can’t beat you, then it’s his own fault!” similarly, if he reaches the true Emperor realm, all of you at the true Emperor realm can take action. This old man will not interfere!</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice sounded.</p><p>The eyes of the wind race, the Golden Crow race, and the other forces flickered.</p><p>Right now, those below the martial Supreme realm could not make a move. Almost no one was Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>However, as long as Lu Ming broke through to the void Thearch realm, all the void thearchs would be able to take action.</p><p>The void Emperor was divided into one to seven stars, and the gap between one star and seven stars was huge.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming broke through to the illusionary divine stage, that would be their chance.</p><p>alright, there are so many people here today. I hope senior will keep his word!</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch said. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s talent, it was almost certain that he would become a Celestial Emperor.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming broke through to the void Emperor realm, he would get rid of Lu Ming at all costs.</p><p>“This old man is a man of his word, get lost!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice rang out. Then, his walking stick trembled and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The clan leader of the Wind Clan cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, then turned around and left.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he left the place with Xiangxiang Bella and the rest. They headed towards the peak of the mountain. They wanted to exchange their spoils of war for resources.</p><p>He knew very well that the reason why Uncle Kong had set such a rule was to train him.</p><p>After he broke through to the void Thearch realm, all of the other void thearchs would be able to take action. This would indeed put a lot of pressure on him, but it would also have the effect of tempering himself.</p><p>Of course, if the opponent’s true Emperor were to attack, it wouldn’t be a test but a crushing defeat.</p><p>These conditions gave the wind race, the Golden Crow race, and the other forces hope to kill Lu Ming. Naturally, the other party agreed. Otherwise, it would be like what the other party had said, to fight to the death.</p><p>All of this naturally had to be built on the terrifying battle power of uncle Kong. Only a powerful deterrent would be able to make the other party yield.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others came to the place where they could exchange for treasures and resources. This time, no one made things difficult for them. They exchanged all the third eye of the three-eyed God race for various treasures that they could use.</p><p>Lu Ming mainly focused on sacred medicine and raw gemstones.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram in the Phoenix Palace’s encampment, Lu Ming kept throwing sacred medicine into the Dayan elixir furnace. He controlled the elixir fire to refine the sacred medicine, and the medicinal power of the sacred medicine seeped into Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>Qiu Yue was floating quietly in the Dayan elixir furnace. Her face was ruddy and she looked normal, but she had not woken up.</p><p>now that the foreign tribes have invaded, we don’t know where Vientiane tower is. Qiu Yue, after we have quelled the foreign tribes, 1 will definitely look for Vientiane tower and find a way to save you!</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. He then closed the lid of the furnace and kept the Dayan elixir furnace in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and arrived at another mountain peak.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu’s physical body stood on the peak of the mountain, constantly absorbing the energy of the outside world.</p><p>However, the energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body during this period of time was still less than one percent.</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was like an incomparably huge water tank, and energy was like water. It was too difficult to fill this water tank with water.</p><p>After such a long period of time, including the one million or so high-grade raw stones that Lu Ming had consumed previously, it was still less than one percent.</p><p>Who knew how long it would take to reach 100%.</p><p>However, this was the body left behind by the celestial Thearch. Even if there was only 10% of the energy stored in it, the power would still be shocking when it exploded.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out a pile of bracelets. They were all the storage bracelets he had obtained from the three-eyed God. He then organized the items in the storage bracelets.</p><p>Then, there was a pile of black crystals on the ground. They were piled up like a mountain, and no one knew how many pieces there were.</p><p>This kind of crystal was also a kind of energy crystal, very similar to a raw stone. However, it was not raw Qi inside, but a strange energy. Warriors could also absorb and refine it, but the difficulty of refining it was higher than raw Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to fuse the energy of these crystals into the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a large number of crystals exploded, turning into surging energy that was absorbed by the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming did not participate in any battles. He focused on helping the celestial Thearch’s physical body refine the crystals.</p><p>In three days, all the crystals had been refined, and the energy stored in the celestial Emperor’s body had finally broken through one percent and reached about one point five percent.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>He was getting closer and closer to ten percent.</p><p>Back then, the celestial Emperor’s Mark had told him that he could only control the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body when he could control 10% of the stored energy.</p><p>This was because the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body was made of stone. Right now, it was like a puppet. Without enough energy, it couldn’t be activated.</p><p>As long as the energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s body reached ten percent, it would become Lu Ming’s greatest trump card.</p><p>In the following days, he was still fighting against the three-eyed God race and tempering himself on the battlefield.</p><p>It was unknown if it was because the three eyed God race’s forces were split into eight, but the forces that came to the ancient Moon Holy Land’s side were not strong. After another half a month, the three eyed God race was gradually suppressed by the ancient Moon Holy Land’s forces, and they were even forced to retreat.</p><p>Looks like the three-eyed God race wasn’t that hard to deal with after all.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread throughout Mount Yuan.</p><p>In the ancient capital of Mount Yuan, the sky Fire Emperor, huntian Emperor, and formless Emperor announced to the world that they had gathered all the experts in the entire Mount Yuan to prepare for a full-on counterattack.</p><p>As soon as the news came out, Mount Yuan was shaken. Countless powerful cultivators gathered at the ancient capital of Mount Yuan.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were overjoyed when they heard the news.</p><p>These three great emperors were the three great emperors who founded the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Back then, there was no news of the three great emperors after the battle at the heavenly Emperor City. Lu Ming and the rest were worried that the three great emperors would be in trouble. Now, it seemed that they were all fine.</p><p>In ancient Moon Holy Land, all the major forces sent their experts to the yuan mountain ancient capital. They met up with the other experts and started their counterattack.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed the Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect cultivators to the ancient capital of Mount Yuan to participate in the battle.</p><p>The ancient capital of Mount Yuan was located in the North of Mount Yuan. A long time ago, this place was once the number one Holy Land of Mount Yuan. However, after the appearance of the heavenly Emperor City, it had stepped down from the number one throne.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they discovered that countless experts had gathered at the ancient capital of Mount Yuan. They came from all over the place..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
