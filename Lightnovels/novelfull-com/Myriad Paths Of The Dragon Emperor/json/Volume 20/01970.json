It was about to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a blade light crossed the void and slashed down at the star River.</p><p>This blade light was filled with the aura of death.</p><p>When the saber Light slashed down, everything was destroyed!</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes narrowed. He waved his hand and slashed out a shocking sword radiance, which clashed with the saber radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying, ear-piercing sound rang out. Endless blade light and sword Qi swept in all directions. Xing Chen’s figure shook slightly and he took a step back.</p><p>A figure appeared in the sky. He carried a saber on his back and his hair was dancing wildly.</p><p>It was the death blade!</p><p>At that moment, his aura was extremely shocking. He had also reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Furthermore, there was also a Halo around him. It was the light of death.</p><p>Clearly, the death blade had also obtained a great opportunity during this period of time and made great progress. Not only did it have a breakthrough in its cultivation, but it had also refined the light of death.</p><p>“Star River, your opponent is me!”</p><p>The death blade stepped through the air and stood in front of the star River.</p><p>“Death blade, you again!”</p><p>Killing intent bloomed in Xing He’s eyes, and he said,” death blade, although you’ve reached the peak of the absolute Saint realm and cultivated the light of death, you’re still no match for me!</p><p>“Not your match? You’ll know once you try, death heavenly blade!”</p><p>The death blade was very direct. As soon as he finished speaking, he attacked. The battle blade on his back was unsheathed, and the terrifying death blade light slashed toward the star River.</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes turned serious. A combat sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>Although he sounded very confident, he didn’t dare to be careless in the face of the death blade.</p><p>The death blade was the child of death, and now, he had cultivated the light of death and entered the perfected absolute Saint realm. They were at the same level, so he couldn’t be careless.</p><p>A dazzling sword radiance burst forth, as if it was going to pierce through heaven and earth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Two figures, two sword lights and two blade lights collided, and a dazzling light burst out between heaven and earth.</p><p>The eternal Star River and the death blade were engaged in a fierce battle. The momentum was terrifying, and no one dared to stand within a radius of hundreds of miles for fear of being dragged in.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged dozens of moves and were evenly matched.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had wanted to have a big fight with the Galaxy. However, it was good that the death blade had made a move. He had to block the Galaxy first as he still had things to do.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he dashed in one direction at top speed.</p><p>That direction was where the Daluo heaven sect was located.</p><p>At this time, many Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect were attacking Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others.</p><p>The number of Emperor-to-be from the Daluo heaven sect was also shocking. Although it was less than the Heng family, there were still nearly 100 people.</p><p>At this moment, Luo cangqiong was standing in the void with a huge seal in his hand. It was the divine seal of deprivation.</p><p>The divine seal of deprivation could continuously deprive the energy in space.</p><p>The longer it was deprived, the more energy it would accumulate, and the more terrifying its power would be.</p><p>At this moment, Luo cangqiong was constantly snatching the energy until he reached the limit of his control before he made his move.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared. He pushed out the divine seal of deprivation with his palm. It was like a mountain, crashing forward.</p><p>However, Lu Ming suddenly appeared in front of the divine seal of deprivation and pointed his finger.</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger exploded, striking the divine seal of deprivation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom was heard. The divine seal of deprivation was destroyed and Lu Ming’s figure drifted backward for a distance.</p><p>The power of Luo cangqiong’s divine seal of deprivation after he had accumulated power was indeed terrifying. Even with Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was still forced back. However, he was only forced back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you … You … You’re actually able to block my divine seal of deprivation…”</p><p>Luo cangqiong cried out in disbelief.</p><p>After a long time of accumulation, he had deprived a large amount of energy of that move. Its power had reached a shocking level. An ordinary Emperor-to-be would not be able to withstand it and would be killed easily.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had actually blocked it head-on. How could he not be shocked?</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, I’m going to take your life today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Qiu Yue was still unconscious from her serious injuries. He would not let Luo cangqiong go.</p><p>Even if the other party was the great Emperor’s grandson, it was the same.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void and charged towards Luo cangqiong. Luo cangqiong was shocked and could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you managed to escape last time. I’ll kill you again!”</p><p>A burly figure appeared in front of Lu Ming with a giant hammer in his hand.</p><p>This person was the expert who had fought with Lu Ming in the void turbulence. He had a superior-grade celestial spiritual body and was very powerful.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was completely suppressed by the other party.</p><p>But this time, it would not!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His eyes shot out a cold light. At the same time, a ring of light enveloped his body and he pointed his finger.</p><p>&Nbsp; the massive finger of Primal Chaos tribulation struck the enemy’s hammer, causing it to buzz and be sent flying.</p><p>“Your battle strength…”</p><p>The other party was shocked.</p><p>After exchanging one move, he could feel that Lu Ming’s combat strength was much stronger than the last time.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage when he faced him. However, in the exchange just now, he was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>How did Lu Ming’s ability improve so much in such a short period of time?</p><p>“Light of chaos! You’ve refined the light of chaos!”</p><p>The burly man roared.</p><p>“I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He continued to use the chaotic finger of tribulation and pointed.</p><p>&Nbsp; the massive Primal Chaos tribulation finger, suffused with Primal Chaos light, suddenly appeared like a god’s finger and began to crush down.</p><p>The burly man let out a low growl and used all his strength to wave his giant hammer to block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, at this moment, countless runes appeared in Lu Ming’s left hand. A true dragon pounced toward the burly man.</p><p>This was the illusionary spirit scroll, one of the nine scrolls of the Dao of formations. Symbols transformed into true dragons, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>&Nbsp; the burly man’s giant hammer collided with the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>He had used all his strength to block Lu Ming’s chaos finger of tribulation. How could he have the energy to block the attack of the array Dao laws ‘illusionary spirit scroll?</p><p>The true dragon pounced on the burly man’s body. With a long roar, it clawed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The burly man’s body trembled violently. With a muffled groan, he retreated rapidly and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed up quickly. He waved his palm and a huge shadow of the prison-suppressing stele fell from the sky, pressing down on the burly man.</p><p>The burly man let out a blood-curdling screech as his body began to crack. It was unknown how many bones in his body had been broken.</p><p>Then, runes glowed on Lu Ming’s left hand and another true dragon flew out. It grabbed the burly man and tore him apart.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the burly man’s body was torn apart.</p><p>The burly man, an Emperor-to-be with a superior-grade celestial spiritual body, was killed by Lu Ming’s series of attacks.</p><p>the nine scrolls of array Dao are indeed profound. If I can fuse the annihilation scroll, illusionary spirit scroll, and sealed scroll together, the power will increase even more!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
