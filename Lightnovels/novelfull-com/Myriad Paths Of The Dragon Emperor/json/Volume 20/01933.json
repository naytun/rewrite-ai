After that, the group of people increased their speed and rushed down.</p><p>The other forces did the same. They rushed down and entered different flower petals.</p><p>However, Lu Ming noticed one thing. No one had entered one of the nine petals. It seemed that only eight petals could enter.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and the rest were approaching the Lotus.</p><p>When they approached the Lotus, a powerful force acted on their bodies.</p><p>This force was a kind of attraction force. It was extremely powerful and difficult to resist. Their bodies were pulled toward different petals.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Luo Tianyi, Huang Ling, desolate power, and the rest separated from Lu Ming and entered different petals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was falling towards one of the petals.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I want to go with you, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubble’s voice was heard. Initially, she was flying toward another petal. However, bubble cast the space-time law and broke free from the confinement of gravity. She rushed to Lu Ming’s side and entered the petal with him.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his head spinning. The next moment, he appeared in a dense forest.</p><p>“Bubble, it’s gone!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and realized that bubbles was not by his side.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that he would randomly appear in different places when he entered the world of flower petals.</p><p>“What is this place? Let’s take a look in the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, his figure soared into the sky and flew high.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned when he flew high up in the sky. He noticed that there were many figures in the sky.</p><p>Clearly, they were all like him, people who had entered this place from the outside.</p><p>“This … It’s an Island!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked down.</p><p>Standing at an altitude of tens of thousands of meters, one could clearly see that below them was an Island. Outside the island was the vast and endless sea.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a few figures flashed and surrounded Lu Ming. A powerful and terrifying aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be in the same territory as us. Today is the day you die!”</p><p>One of them laughed out loud, his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>This man was an expert from the Golden Crow race, an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>On the side, the other people were not from the Golden Crow race. From their auras, they were from the Sirius tower, the WAN family, and the purple Extreme sect.</p><p>There were five people in total. Two were at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, two were in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm, and one was an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>a few elders are actually dealing with a young man. Interesting!</p><p>“It is indeed very interesting!”</p><p>All around, the others cast sidelong glances at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, no one recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>The people who entered this time were absolute Saints and Emperor-to-be from various forces. They came from different Holy Lands and forces. Very few of them had seen Lu Ming before, so naturally, none of them had seen him before.</p><p>a young man has also entered this place. He’s overestimating himself!</p><p>An old man said while stroking his long beard. He was an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>This time, almost all the people who entered the Lotus World were absolute Saints and there were many emperors-to-be among them. If a young man wanted to come in and fight for the treasure, he must be overestimating himself.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Very good?”</p><p>The Golden Crow clan’s expert was stunned.</p><p>“You’ve come to die, very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming added.</p><p>hahaha, we’re here to die. Young man, you really don’t know how to be modest. Let’s see how you’re going to kill me!</p><p>An expert from the WAN clan laughed. He was an absolute Saint in the great circle, and his acupoints lit up one after another. Saint weapons flew out continuously, and terrifying battle weapon Qi gathered and blasted out.</p><p>“You’re not that good at the ten thousand soldiers scroll, are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. An absolute Saint weapon, a sword, appeared in his hand. With a slash, the Qi of the WAN family’s combat weapon was destroyed. The sword light did not stop as it continued to slash down.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The WAN family’s expert did not even have the strength to fight back. He was directly split in half by Lu Ming’s sword and died here.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the Saint weapons and storage rings of the WAN family’s experts.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The others were shocked, and their eyes widened.</p><p>An absolute Saint in the great circle was actually lulled by Lu Ming with a single sword. This kind of strength was too terrifying.</p><p>The experts from the Skywolf tower and the Golden Crow clan gasped in disbelief.</p><p>It had only been a short while, but Lu Ming was already able to kill someone in the absolute Saint perfection. This rate of improvement was too shocking.</p><p>The people from the other forces were also dumbfounded.</p><p>he’s so young and has such combat power. Who is he? ”</p><p>could he be a Supreme genius from the yuan mountain sacred Academy? ”</p><p>Those people discussed and no longer dared to underestimate Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>attack! the Golden Crow Tribe cultivator shouted. A River of laws appeared on his body, converging into a terrifying attack that charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other few people also launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>The combat sword in Lu Ming’s hand flew out and turned into a destructive sword light, killing everything.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword gleam pierced through the head of an absolute Saint peak expert.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art and punched out continuously. Illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared and pressed down on the crowd.</p><p>The remaining two absolute Saints couldn’t fight back at all under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele. Their bodies were torn apart.</p><p>Only the Emperor-to-be could resist it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow race, the river of laws turned into a terrifying flame. Several Suns appeared and collided with the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele, blowing it apart.</p><p>However, his body also trembled violently and he continued to retreat. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>He was an Emperor-to-be who had comprehended a law to perfection and formed a River of laws. He was one step into the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>With his cultivation level, not only did he not suppress Lu Ming, but the few collisions just now made him feel that his River of laws was about to be broken, how can this little bastard’s combat strength be so strong? ”</p><p>Quasi-Emperor Jin Wu took a deep breath and suddenly turned around to run.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he continued to fight, he would die Here.</p><p>“Do you think you can leave now? Primal Chaos tribulation finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He stretched out a hand and pointed at the void.</p><p>High up in the sky, the wind and clouds gathered and a huge finger was formed, pressing down on quasi-Emperor golden Crow.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow race let out a long cry and transformed into his true form. His wings were hundreds of meters wide.</p><p>The river of laws surrounded him, and he launched his most powerful attack at the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a violent boom, quasi-Emperor Jin Wu groaned and his body was sent flying down the island like a cannonball..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
