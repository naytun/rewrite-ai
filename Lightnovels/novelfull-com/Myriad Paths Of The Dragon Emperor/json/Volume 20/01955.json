The distance that Lu Ming had covered was further than the person who had walked the furthest previously.</p><p>Hmph! the giant wolf from the heavenly Wolf tower and the quasi-Emperor from the Golden Crow race snorted coldly. They were a little unhappy.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming came to the nearest plant.</p><p>It was a purple grass with a purple flower on it, and it was emitting a strange power.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. Then, he pulled up the purple flower by its roots and kept it in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Many old men with snow-white hair were staring at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>Treasures that could increase one’s lifespan were extremely rare, and every time they appeared, their prices would skyrocket.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward, walking towards another plant.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had picked six plants.</p><p>Lu Ming had almost plucked all the plants in the periphery.</p><p>He could only pick more plants if he went deeper.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to walk. However, the deeper he went, the stronger the power of time became. The Laws of Chaos that surrounded his body were also shaking violently.</p><p>Although the law of chaos was of a higher level, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still low.</p><p>Although it was higher in quality, it was lacking in quantity. When the power of time exceeded a certain range, the Laws of Chaos still couldn’t resist it.</p><p>At this moment, a transparent bubble enveloped Lu Ming. At once, Lu Ming felt that the power of time in the outside world had lightened.</p><p>Bubbles had made her move. Her space-time laws included time and space, and no other law could resist the power of time.</p><p>The pressure on Lu Ming was lifted. He quickened his pace and continued to move forward. Not long after, he was almost halfway up the mountain, space-time law, good, good!</p><p>When the sagemaster saw this, his eyes shone with a dazzling light and a deep desire.</p><p>Of course, no one saw the sagemaster’s eyes.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming had picked more than ten plants.</p><p>But halfway up the mountain, he could no longer continue.</p><p>Even with the help of bubbles ‘space-time laws, he was unable to advance any further.</p><p>&Nbsp; the time energy up ahead was simply too terrifying. If they continued forward, they definitely wouldn’t be able to stop it.</p><p>They had no choice but to stop. Lu Ming sat cross-legged and used the power of time to hone his chaos laws.</p><p>As for bubbles, she was also carefully sensing the time power of the outside world.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why aren’t you coming out?!”</p><p>Someone spoke up and stared at Lu Ming, hoping that he would come out and buy some plants that could increase one’s lifespan.</p><p>“He seems to be cultivating!”</p><p>“Let’s wait a little longer, he’ll come out sooner or later!”</p><p>Many people had gathered at Lu Ming’s side, waiting for him to come out and trade with him.</p><p>More than ten days had passed. Lu Ming and bubbles finally could not hold on any longer. They got up and left the time mountain.</p><p>As soon as he stepped out, Lu Ming was surrounded by a group of old men.</p><p>Lu Ming, how much are the plants in the time God mountain? sell me a few. We can discuss the price!</p><p>“I also want a few, name your price!”</p><p>The group of old men spoke one after another, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>“I’m not selling!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands.</p><p>Treasures that could increase one’s lifespan were few and far between. He wanted to keep them for when he returned to the divine wilderness continent in the future, many people would have a use for them.</p><p>His parents and some others were not talented enough and could not cultivate to the Martial Emperor realm. One day, their lifespans would run out and these plants would come in handy.</p><p>“You’re not selling?”</p><p>Immediately, some of the old men became anxious and said,” “Lu Ming, you’re young and talented. It’s a given that you’ll break through to the martial Supreme realm in the future. There’s no point in keeping these plants that can increase your lifespan!”</p><p>that’s right, I want two. How about you sell me two?”</p><p>“I just want one!”</p><p>These old men looked at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>“I also need to use it, so seniors, I’m sorry, please make way!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, you have no use for it, yet you don’t sell it to these seniors. You’re evil!”</p><p>that’s right. There are so many plants here. You’re going too far if you want to keep all of them for yourself!</p><p>“There are some seniors here whose lifespans are approaching their end, and you’re just going to watch them die?”</p><p>Not far away, the giant wolf from the Sirius tower, the quasi-emperors of the wind race, and the Golden Crow race sneered.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. These people were clearly trying to sow discord.</p><p>As expected, some of the old men’s eyes flickered with cold light. “Lu Ming, give some up. It’s too much to take it all for yourself!”</p><p>“We have so many people here. If we use force, I’m afraid you won’t be able to protect those plants!”</p><p>The giant wolf from the Sirius tower and the Emperor-to-be from the wind race sneered at this scene.</p><p>“If you don’t sell, you’ll have to make a move?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold. The atmosphere at the scene became tense.</p><p>everyone, time’s almost up. If you want to fight, then wait until we leave the divine time Island!</p><p>The sagemaster said as he stepped forward and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>At the same time, the experts of the divine time Island came to Lu Ming’s side, seemingly wanting to protect him.</p><p>This surprised Lu Ming. The sagemaster did not seem to want anything to happen to him.</p><p>The old men’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles had joined forces and it was already extremely difficult to deal with them. Now that the people from the divine time Island had joined in, they were not confident even if they took action.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, I hope that you can sell me some plants after we leave this place!</p><p>In the end, some old men chose not to attack and retreated from the encirclement.</p><p>After that, other people also withdrew.</p><p>In the end, the remaining few people knew that they couldn’t do anything and could only helplessly walk to the side.</p><p>This made the giant wolf from the Skywolf tower and the Emperor-to-be from the wind race look a little pale.</p><p>He was looking forward to a conflict between Lu Ming and those old men!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the giant wolf from the Skywolf tower, the Emperor-to-be from the wind race, and the others.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, several days had passed.</p><p>“Time’s Up. We can set off now!”</p><p>The sagemaster’s eyes brightened as he spoke.</p><p>However, for the time being, no one stepped forward, all hoping that someone else would take the lead.</p><p>The sagemaster naturally knew that everyone was worried. With a wave of his hand, some of the emperors-to-be from the divine time Island flew up and charged into the canyon.</p><p>Those people were extremely fast. They rushed into the canyon and were indeed fine.</p><p>Only then did everyone relax and rush into the canyon.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the crowd and rushed into the canyon.</p><p>“The power of time has indeed been reduced by many times!” Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The group was very fast, and they quickly passed through half of the canyon.</p><p>However, after passing through half of it, their speed finally slowed down.</p><p>Because from here on, the power of time would gradually become stronger.</p><p>The group continued to move forward. After a while, some of the weaker cultivators finally couldn’t hold on any longer and retreated out of the canyon.</p><p>However, the power of time here was nothing to Lu Ming and bubbles. They traveled quickly and slowly approached the end of the canyon.</p><p>At the end of the canyon, there was an ancient altar. No one knew how many years it had been there for. It was ancient and weathered, and it emitted a strong time power..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
