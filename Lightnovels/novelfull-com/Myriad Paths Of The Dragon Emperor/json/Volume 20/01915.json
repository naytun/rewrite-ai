Its eyes were bloodshot as it stomped heavily. Suddenly, the mountain rocks exploded and the entire mountain shook violently.</p><p>The violent ape’s huge body rushed toward Lu Ming and the others like a cannonball. The huge rod in its hand smashed toward Lu Ming and the others with unstoppable momentum.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Lu Ming pointed with his finger, forming the chaos finger of tribulation. He charged at Bao Yuan and clashed with his giant staff.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; in the next moment, the primal Chaos tribulation finger was shattered, but Bao Yuan had also been stopped.</p><p>When Lu Ming was a great saint in the Great Perfection realm, he could cross realms and kill an absolute Saint in the Great Perfection realm.</p><p>Although an Emperor-to-be was much stronger than an absolute Saint in the great circle, after breaking through to the absolute Saint realm, his fighting power had also increased by a large margin. He could fight against an Emperor-to-be expert.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Paopao stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder. It opened its mouth and a transparent bubble formed, enveloping the violent ape within.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>break! Bao Yuan roared and tried to break the transparent bubble with all his strength. However, the bubble’s strength was enough to fight against an Emperor-to-be, so how could the other party break it so easily?</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the surroundings, roars could be heard as one giant ape after another charged over.</p><p>you guys block those violent apes. Leave this to me and bubble!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Luo Tianyi, and the others flashed and rushed to the surrounding violent apes to block them.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to charge at the Emperor-to-be violent ape. He pointed his finger again and a huge finger crushed the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to take out the Dayan elixir furnace to refine the giant ape, but he realized that there was no Dayan elixir furnace in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. Although this world of formations was mysterious, it was not omnipotent. It was impossible to condense treasures above the sovereign weapon.</p><p>Sovereign weapons were forged by Martial Emperor powerhouses with all kinds of precious materials. If the formation world could be condensed into one, it would be too terrifying.</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger pressed down, and Bao Yuan roared as he struggled with all his strength to resist.</p><p>&Nbsp; but it was suppressed by the spacetime dimension laws, and the power it could use was less than fifty percent of its normal power. It was struck by the chaos finger of tribulation and sent flying, crashing into the mountain.</p><p>The mountain peak shook, gravel flew, and smoke and dust filled the air.</p><p>“Space cutting! Time stop!”</p><p>Paopao flew out and circulated the spacetime law with all her might. The space turned into a terrifying cutting force that slashed towards Bao Yuan. At the same time, she used the power of spacetime stop to restrict Bao Yuan’s movements.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and launched a chaotic finger of tribulation with all his might.</p><p>With the two of them working together, the Laws of Chaos and the laws of time and space worked together. Their combat power was not as simple as one plus one equals two, but it was multiplied by several times.</p><p>&Nbsp; Bao Yuan had almost no power to resist. When the two attacks landed on his body, he roared and his body exploded.</p><p>&Nbsp; after Bao Yuan’s body exploded, it began to exude a dazzling light. In the light, nine array discs actually appeared.</p><p>“So this set of formation disks is in the body of this violent ape!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He waved his hand and put away the nine array discs.</p><p>“The formation plate is in our hands, retreat!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted and used the prison-suppressing heavenly art. Nine illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared and sent the nine violent apes flying. Qiu Yue and the rest took the opportunity to retreat and join Lu Ming’s group to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>Behind them, the other violent apes roared angrily and chased after Lu Ming and the rest. However, they were not good at speed and were soon left behind by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Xie nianjun looked into the distance and said,” it seems that the array disc has been obtained by Lu Ming and the rest. Let’s retreat!</p><p>After that, the people of the ancient Saint clan broke out of the encirclement and left the place.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest retreated from the absolute Saint battlefield and returned to the mountain peak where they lived.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the sky above the mountain peak. With a wave of his hand, nine array discs appeared and emitted a dazzling radiance.</p><p>&Nbsp; one of the array boards floated in the air above the mountain, while the other eight flew in all directions, forming a light screen that covered a hundred-mile radius.</p><p>Below, the paragons of the Phoenix Palace, the divine elephant sect, the Thunder God sect, and other forces burst into cheers.</p><p>With the protection of this array plate, they could cultivate in peace in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Usually, they could go to those cultivation places in groups. After they finished cultivating, they would return here and would not have to worry about being attacked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, Long Chen, and the others flew to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now that we have the array disc, it’s time to form an alliance!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I’m pushing Lu Ming to be the alliance leader. You guys won’t have any objections, right?”</p><p>Huang Li was the first to speak. After he finished speaking, he looked at Ouyang Wushuang and the others.</p><p>“I naturally have no objections!”</p><p>Huang Ling smiled.</p><p>“I also have no objections!”</p><p>“I don’t have any either!”</p><p>Following that, Long Chen, Qiu Yue, and Luo Xiang spoke up respectively. They naturally supported Lu Ming as the alliance leader.</p><p>Finally, everyone looked at Ouyang Wushuang and Luo Tianyi.</p><p>of course, I support Lu Ming!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi and Ouyang Wushuang both nodded. They were silver inheritors and had to listen to Lu Ming’s orders. Why would they fight for the position of Alliance leader with him?</p><p>okay, then our Alliance will be called the Dragon Alliance. Let the sacred Institute know that the Dragon Alliance will be officially established in three days. At that time, all parties are welcome to join us!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke and made a decision.</p><p>His eyes shone with anticipation. He had an idea. He wanted to make the Dragon Alliance flourish in the yuan continent and become an Overlord force.</p><p>Then, everything would start now.</p><p>The yuan mountain sacred Academy was filled with top geniuses from all over the world. If these people were absorbed into the dragon Alliance now, they would definitely play a very important role in the future development of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>“Yes, Alliance master!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang immediately cupped his fists.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>Following that, Luo Tianyi, desolate li, Long Chen, and the others also cupped their fists.</p><p>After that, it was Phoenix Palace’s turn. The divine elephant sect’s paragons saluted Lu Ming one after another. Then, everyone got busy, spreading the news and preparing for the banquet three days later.</p><p>When the news spread, the entire Yuan mountain sacred Academy was in an uproar.</p><p>The third array disc had landed in the hands of Lu Ming and the others. It was indeed shocking. Lu Ming and the others ‘strength was obvious to all. This was definitely a powerful force in the valley.</p><p>Some of the small groups that had not joined the heavenly Emperor Alliance or the divine fire Alliance began to consider whether they should join Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>it’s better to join the heavenly Emperor Alliance than the Dragon Alliance. Lu Ming has offended the star River. He will be killed by the star River sooner or later!</p><p>that’s right. The Heng family is guarding outside the sacred Institute. Lu Ming can’t even leave the sacred Institute. If he joins the Dragon Alliance, I’m afraid he’ll be implicated by Lu Ming. The Heng family might also target him. That would be terrible!</p><p>This was the opinion of some small groups. They felt that Lu Ming and the rest would be defeated at the hands of the Heng Xing River sooner or later. If they joined the Dragon Alliance, they might be implicated.</p><p>However, there were also some small groups that had opposite opinions.</p><p>They felt that Lu Ming and the rest had endless potential. Although their cultivation level was still low, they would be very terrifying in the future.</p><p>Putting everything else aside, Lu Ming even had two sons of God. If his cultivation level increased, would he be afraid of the eternal Star River?</p><p>Therefore, a portion of them chose to join the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>[ author’s note: PS: adding on to the previous accumulation and the late night of writing, I’ve finally completed 30 chapters and fulfilled my promise to my brothers and sisters. ]</p><p>However, little mu was too tired, so he was going to sleep.
