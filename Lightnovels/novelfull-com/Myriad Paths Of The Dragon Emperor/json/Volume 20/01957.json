He had killed four Emperor-to-be in an instant with a thunderous blow just now. It sent a chill down everyone’s spine.</p><p>This was the time mountain. They were no match for Lu Ming. Some of them did not even dare to move forward and retreated from the time mountain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the other two sides, the emperors-to-be of the divine time Island were bombarding the other two ancient altars.</p><p>However, they couldn’t stop the power of time from the altar at all. A few quasi-emperors from the divine time Island had died under the power of time. The others all retreated and didn’t dare to continue.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The sagemaster roared in his heart, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming did not listen to him and went to destroy the other two altars.</p><p>If it wasn’t for some special reason that he couldn’t do it himself, he would have done it himself.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles kept going up and they were getting closer to the peak.</p><p>Lu Ming could already see the divine Tree of time at the top of the mountain clearly.</p><p>The divine Tree of time was only a meter tall. Its emerald green leaves glowed with a crystalline light, and two milky-white fruits hung from its branches.</p><p>“I want it, I want it, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles stared at the small tree, his eyes shining and his saliva almost drooling out.</p><p>However, the closer they got to the peak, the stronger the power of time became. When they were close to the small tree, Lu Ming and bubbles could feel a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the essence energy in his body was slowly flowing away. His smooth skin was also slowly becoming dry and wrinkled.</p><p>This proved that his lifespan was slowly decreasing.</p><p>The small tree was less than a hundred meters away from them.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He circulated the chaos law to the extreme and coincided with the space-time law of bubbles to resist the power of time together.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took out the Tai Chi disk array. A Tai Chi pattern was formed and pressed down on the two of them.</p><p>Following that, the Dayan elixir furnace also appeared. It floated above the two of them and sprinkled down a light screen.</p><p>As a result, the pressure on them was greatly reduced. They continued to move forward, and the distance between them and the small tree was getting closer and closer.</p><p>Ninety meters, eighty meters, seventy meters …</p><p>&Nbsp; very quickly, he was only fifty meters away from the tree. The time energy here was shockingly powerful.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that they had destroyed an altar, they definitely wouldn’t have been able to make it here.</p><p>“You can’t reach the peak, you can’t reach the peak!”</p><p>The sagemaster mumbled. He really hoped that Lu Ming would not be able to reach the peak.</p><p>In that case, Lu Ming had no choice but to come down and destroy one of the other two altars. Only then would he be able to obtain the divine Tree of time. But he was destined to be disappointed.</p><p>&Nbsp; Paopao spat out a crystal that gave off a terrifying spacetime ripple that blocked the time energy as they continued forward.</p><p>Forty meters, thirty meters …</p><p>They continued to approach the small tree and finally came to the side of the time tree.</p><p>“Fruit!”</p><p>Bubbles ‘eyes glowed as she swallowed one of the milky-white fruits in one gulp, showing a look of enjoyment.</p><p>Then, bubble grabbed the tree with both hands, pulled it down, and swallowed it.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The sagemaster’s face darkened when he saw Lu Ming and the rest uprooting the divine Tree of time.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and dashed down the mountain with the bubbles.</p><p>It was difficult to go up the mountain but easy to go down the mountain. Lu Ming was as fast as lightning and he was halfway up the mountain in no time. At that moment, a figure appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was the sagemaster. “Lu Ming, now that you’ve obtained the divine Tree of time, you should go and destroy the other two altars!”</p><p>The sagemaster said.</p><p>“Since you’ve already obtained the divine Tree of time, why do you still want to destroy the other two altars? Isn’t that unnecessary?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Destroying those two altars is useful to me. If you help me, I’ll definitely reward you handsomely!” The sagemaster’s face was gloomy.</p><p>“No need, I’ll be leaving this world soon. I’m not interested in your thanks. Move!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He wanted to go around the sagemaster and leave this place. “Today, you have to agree even if you don’t want to. Attack!”</p><p>The sagemaster bellowed. At the same time, he made the first move. His body twisted violently and transformed into a combat sword, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. This was the first time he had seen such a divine power.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and threw a punch. A Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and pressed toward the sagemaster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sagemaster was sent flying as he angrily shouted,”Damn the prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a terrifying force rushing into his mind and attacking his soul, causing his soul to shake violently.</p><p>“Soul attack! This sagemaster doesn’t have a physical body!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>From the exchange of blows earlier, Lu Ming realized that the sagemaster was not a physical body but a spiritual body.</p><p>No wonder his body could transform into a sword to attack.</p><p>However, it was strange that a spirit body would not dissipate after existing for a long time.</p><p>Moreover, the other party seemed to be very afraid of his prison defending monument’s attack. In Lu Ming’s memory, only some demonic creatures and the three-eyed God race would be afraid of the prison defending monument. Could it be that the sagemaster was a demonic or evil spirit?</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the sagemaster didn’t have good intentions when he asked him to destroy the remaining two altars. Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the other emperors-to-be of the divine time Island had also arrived. They all launched attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, bubbles pressed down with both hands and the void seemed to be frozen. The experts from the divine time Island froze for a moment. Lu Ming rushed past them and headed down the mountain.</p><p>“Everyone, Lu Ming has the divine Tree of time. Once he consumes it, his lifespan will double and it even has the effect of breaking through bottlenecks. Are you going to let him have it just like that?”</p><p>The sagemaster roared, his voice reverberating through the entire area.</p><p>Many Emperor-to-be from the outside world stared at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s stop!”</p><p>“Let’s Make a Deal!”</p><p>One by one, the Emperor-to-be experts charged toward Lu Ming. Their powerful auras exploded, forming a terrifying pressure.</p><p>There were dozens of Emperor-to-be and they were terrifying when they joined forces. Even if Lu Ming and bubbles joined forces, they were definitely not their match.</p><p>Furthermore, the other party’s Saint energy was so dense that even the bubble’s spacetime power could not pass through.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stay here and destroy the other two altars!”</p><p>Behind them, the sagemaster led the people from the divine time Island and charged over.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground heavily, causing it to rumble. His body shot into the sky.</p><p>bubble, spacetime tunnel!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles immediately opened a space-time Tunnel and Lu Ming rushed over.</p><p>“Not good, stop him!”</p><p>The sagemaster roared. Together with the experts of the divine time Island, they used all their strength to attack the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>At the same time, the Emperor-to-be from the outside world also launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Dozens of terrifying attacks crushed over, causing the space to shake violently, and a hideous gap appeared.</p><p>The space-time Tunnel also exploded instantly. Lu Ming and bubbles were blasted out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
