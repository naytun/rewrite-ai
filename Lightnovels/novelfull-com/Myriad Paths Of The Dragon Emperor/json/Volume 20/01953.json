The key was that the spacetime laws were too profound and too useful in trapping enemies.</p><p>The space-time law trapped the enemy while Lu Ming was the main attacker. When they worked together, their destructive power was shocking.</p><p>At this moment, a few more people stepped into the air from the distance, their bodies surrounded by the river of laws.</p><p>Another Emperor-to-be from the temporal divine Island had arrived. He had gathered with the previous three emperors-to-be and a powerful aura was pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>A great battle was about to start!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>This figure was enveloped by a mysterious power. The area was completely distorted, as if time and space were changing.</p><p>He could only vaguely see that it was a black-robed old man.</p><p>When the Emperor-to-be experts of the divine time Island saw this old man, they bowed and greeted,” “We pay our respects to the sagemaster!”</p><p>“We pay our respects to the sagemaster!”</p><p>The expressions of the other cultivators from the divine time Island also changed as they bowed.</p><p>“The sagemaster?”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. It seemed that this sagemaster had a very high status. Even the quasi-emperors on the divine time Island were very respectful to him.</p><p>The sagemaster nodded slightly and looked at Lu Ming with a kind smile. He then looked at the other emperors-to-be and said,” everyone here is a powerful existence. If we fight here, the divine time Island will be greatly damaged. Can you give this old man some face and temporarily stop the battle?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not say anything.</p><p>The eyes of the emperors-to-be of the other forces flickered, but they didn’t speak.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming and dandan’s combat strength had skyrocketed, they were not confident even though they had the advantage in numbers. If the people from the divine time Island were to withdraw, they would be even more uncertain.</p><p>“Reporting to the sacred master, this man has killed several elders of my divine time Island. You can not let him off!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan was still unwilling to give up. He reported to the sagemaster that he wanted to borrow the power of the divine time Island to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Are you teaching me how to do things?”</p><p>The sagemaster looked at Xuan Chuan and his voice turned cold.</p><p>Xuan Chuan’s face changed drastically. He knelt down immediately and shouted with a pale face,” “I don’t dare, this disciple doesn’t dare, please forgive me, sagemaster!”</p><p>The sagemaster ignored Xuan Chuan and continued to look at Lu Ming and the rest, you’re from beyond the heavens and have come to the ten thousand sea realm. You must be here for the immortal relic and the time God mountain. If you stop fighting, I’ll Take You There!</p><p>The sagemaster’s words stunned the people of ten thousand sea realm.</p><p>Beyond the heavens!</p><p>These experts actually came from beyond the heavens.</p><p>Many people in the ten thousand sea realm knew that it was connected to the other eight realms. They could communicate, but only Saint emperors could.</p><p>And beyond the Nine Worlds, there were even larger worlds.</p><p>Legend had it that the world beyond the heavens was vast and boundless. Martial arts had developed to the extreme, and there were even immortal existences.</p><p>However, all of this was just a legend. No one had ever confirmed it. Now, the sagemaster actually said that these people came from beyond the heavens.</p><p>Perhaps it was true. Otherwise, why would so many experts suddenly appear on the divine time Island?</p><p>beyond the heavens, beyond the heavens! So Lu Ming came from beyond the heavens. That’s right, only beyond the heavens can give birth to a prodigy like Lu Ming!</p><p>While ruan tianjiao was shocked, all sorts of thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>The people of the vast sea nine nations and the xuanling Kingdom were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, for the sake of the sagemaster, I’ll spare your life today!”</p><p>One of the giant wolves from the Skywolf tower said.</p><p>“Spare my life? Hehe, come on, let’s continue the battle and see if you can take my life!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he glared at the giant wolf from the Skywolf tower.</p><p>This made the giant wolf of the Skywolf tower look unsightly. He was only trying to win with his words. If they really had to fight, they had no confidence.</p><p>The sagemaster smiled bitterly, little brother, why don’t we let it go for now? after you go to the time God mountain and leave the time God Island, 1 won’t interfere no matter how you guys want to fight!</p><p>“That’s to give face to the sagemaster and spare their dog lives first!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>If they were to truly fight, he might not be afraid. However, with the addition of the people from the divine time Island, he might not be able to gain an advantage.</p><p>More importantly, the sagemaster gave him a profound feeling.</p><p>The sky Wolf tower’s giant wolves and the others had ugly expressions, but they didn’t refute.</p><p>okay, thank you for giving me face, little brother. The people of ten thousand sea realm can stay here for the time being. No one is allowed to attack. Anyone who violates this rule will be killed without mercy!</p><p>The sagemaster said, his voice turning cold.</p><p>The people from xuanling Kingdom had ugly expressions, but they didn’t dare to refute the sagemaster’s words. So many of their people had died in vain, and they could only admit that they were unlucky.</p><p>friends from beyond the heavens, if you want to explore the time God mountain, then come with me!</p><p>The sagemaster’s voice reverberated in all directions as he flew into the depths of the divine time Island.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and followed the sagemaster.</p><p>The giant wolf from the Sirius tower, the quasi-Emperor of the Golden Crow race, and the quasi-Emperor of the wind race followed behind him with gloomy faces.</p><p>In the sky, one figure after another streaked across the void. All of them were experts from the outside world. They followed the sacred teacher and headed towards the divine time Island.</p><p>“So many people?”</p><p>The people of the ten-thousand sea realm were shocked. So many people had come from beyond the sky, and they were all terrifying experts.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the center of the divine time Island. Up ahead, there was a huge mountain that pierced through the clouds.</p><p>This mountain looked deathly silent. At a glance, it was all bare rocks.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes focused. They saw bones in different parts of the mountain, almost completely decayed.</p><p>How could there be so many bones in this mountain?</p><p>Everyone stopped in their tracks, somewhat bewildered.</p><p>everyone, this is the time God mountain. The entire mountain is deathly silent with only a few plants!</p><p>The sagemaster introduced.</p><p>Everyone observed carefully. Indeed, there were some plants on the mountain, but they were very sparse.</p><p>these plants have the power of time. If a martial artist consumes them, they can increase their lifespan!</p><p>The sagemaster continued.</p><p>“What? It can increase one’s lifespan!”</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise, his eyes emitting a blazing flame.</p><p>A Martial Emperor’s lifespan was endless. Other than facing the great calamity of heaven and earth, they did not need to worry about their lifespan.</p><p>However, those below the martial Supreme realm had limited lifespans.</p><p>A Saint could live for more than 100000 years, but not more than 200000 years.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be was also in this range.</p><p>This time, there were many ancient emperors-to-be who had come. Many of them were already at the end of their lifespans. The plants that could increase their lifespans were a fatal temptation to them.</p><p>also, there’s a small tree at the peak of the divine time mountain. That’s the divine time tree. If a martial artist swallows it, his lifespan will be doubled …</p><p>The sagemaster continued.</p><p>“Double the lifespan!”</p><p>This time, most of the people revealed a fiery light of greed.</p><p>Increasing one’s lifespan by one fold, what kind of concept was that?</p><p>Some of the emperors-to-be were close to the end of their lifespans. However, if their lifespans were doubled, they might be able to enter the Martial Emperor realm and attain immortality.</p><p>The fatal temptation of this matter was irresistible!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
