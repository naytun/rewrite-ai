Yan Song seemed to have woken up from a dream and reacted.</p><p>“You … You dog, what kind of demonic technique did you use that you actually made the Saint of Ming Yan country kneel. How dare you. Just you wait, this matter is not over!”</p><p>After saying this, Yan Song turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming was too strange. He could actually make an expert of the sage state kneel down. He felt his hair standing on end. He wanted to return to the capital first and report to his father. Then, he would send experts to take revenge.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice rang out. He moved and appeared in front of Yan Song. His cold, knife-like gaze swept toward Yan Song, causing Yan song’s expression to change drastically. He could not help but take a few steps back. “What do you want to do?”</p><p>Yan Song shouted.</p><p>“Kneel down and slap your own mouth!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“You dare? Kid, you dare to touch me? Do you understand the consequences?”</p><p>Yan Song shouted.</p><p>“Oh, what are the consequences?”</p><p>Lu Ming said playfully.</p><p>“You dog, listen up. My father is the state preceptor, and my sister is His Majesty’s most beloved imperial concubine. I’ll make sure you die a Graveless death and 1’11 exterminate your entire family!”</p><p>Yan Song shouted and glared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze. He did not believe that Lu Ming would dare to touch him.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming swung his palm.</p><p>This slap was unbelievably fast, and Yan Song had no way of dodging it.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of a slap spread in all directions.</p><p>Yan Song flew out and spun dozens of times in the air. Then, he fell heavily to the ground. Half of his face was puffed up and his teeth were all knocked out by Lu Ming.</p><p>Yan Song was stunned!</p><p>The others were also stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to hit Yan Song.</p><p>He was really bold.</p><p>Yan Song roared hysterically.</p><p>Just now, he had come with a murderous intent and wanted to kill Lu Ming. In the end, a few of his subordinates had knelt in front of Lu Ming for no reason. Now, Lu Ming actually dared to slap him.</p><p>This was a great humiliation. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“Slap his mouth!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming said coldly. He swung his palm in the air. A palm condensed from holy power was formed and slapped Yan song’s face ruthlessly.</p><p>Yan song’s body flew out again and spun a few rounds in the air. Under Lu Ming’s control, he fell to the ground and knelt there.</p><p>“I said just now, 1 want you to pay me back ten times. You gave me one slap, so 1 will give you ten slaps!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He waved his hand again and gave ten more slaps.</p><p>After ten consecutive slaps, Yan song’s face had completely turned into a pig’s head. His face was swollen beyond recognition.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I slapped you two more times!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>In addition to the two slaps from before, he had a total of twelve slaps.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Yan Song was so furious that he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This was simply bullying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a streak of light flew over from the distance and landed on the ground. Ruan tianjiao had arrived.</p><p>When she received the news, she rushed over. When she saw this scene, she was quite speechless.</p><p>Yan Song actually dared to lay his hands on Lu Ming. He was really looking for a beating. She had rushed over not because she was worried about Lu Ming, but because she was afraid that Lu Ming would kill Yan Song in a fit of anger.</p><p>After all, Yan Song was the son of the state preceptor. If he died, there would be trouble.</p><p>heavenly flood Dragon, you’ve come at the right time. This Lu Ming is a spy. He actually dared to hit the experts of our mingyan country. Quickly call for people to take him down and cripple his cultivation. Then, bring him back to the capital for interrogation!</p><p>Seeing ruan tianjiao, Yan Song cried out hysterically again.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao secretly shook his head. This Yan Song really didn’t change.</p><p>Yan Song, I’ve told you long ago that Lu Ming is my guest, not a spy. Moreover, you were the one who started this. You’re the one who brought it upon yourself!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said indifferently.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? I asked for it? Ruan tianjiao, you adulterous couple, just you wait!”</p><p>Yan song’s anger soared to the sky. He left behind a few harsh words and staggered away.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming waved his hand and a few of Yan song’s subordinates flew out and landed heavily on the ground. Then, they climbed up in a sorry state and fled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for not killing Yan Song!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao cupped her fists at Lu Ming. She also understood that Lu Ming did not kill Yan Song because he was most likely thinking for her.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. I hit Yan Song. Will I implicate you? ” he asked.</p><p>“No, I’m one of the five great marshals of the mingyan country after all. Yan Song can’t do anything to me!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shook his head.</p><p>This matter was over just like that. After that, ruan tianjiao continued to train the Army while Lu Ming cultivated every day. After more than ten days, he would head to the capital with ruan tianjiao.</p><p>Time flew by and seven days passed.</p><p>On this day, someone from the capital came with the emperor’s imperial edict.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao received the decree.</p><p>The one who came to deliver the decree was a thin old man. He squinted his eyes and smiled,” general Tian Jiao, congratulations! His Majesty has decreed a marriage for you to young master Yan Song. The marriage will be completed in a few days!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>These words were like a bolt from the blue, causing ruan tianjiao to be stunned. Even ruan tianjiao’s subordinates were stunned.</p><p>The Emperor bestowed a marriage and betrothed ruan tianjiao to Yan Song? How was this possible?</p><p>“Master Chao, are you mistaken? I’m the Marshal of an Army, how could His Majesty grant me a marriage so easily?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao asked.</p><p>Sir Chao’s face darkened. His Majesty personally issued a decree. Furthermore, it has already been announced to the world. How can it be wrong? ”</p><p>“Damn it, it must be Yan Song. What did he say to His Majesty when he returned?”</p><p>“It’s most likely his sister, Consort Qing, who bewitched His Majesty!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s subordinates were furious.</p><p>Needless to say, Yan Song was definitely behind this.</p><p>Yan Song pursued ruan tianjiao, but ruan tianjiao never gave Yan Song a good attitude. Seven days ago, Yan Song was taught a lesson by Lu Ming. He must have harbored a grudge. After he returned to the capital, he must have said something to the Emperor. Otherwise, why would the Emperor suddenly bestow a marriage?</p><p>“Marshal Tian Jiao, accept the decree and thank His Majesty for his kindness!”</p><p>Sir Chao said coldly.</p><p>“Lord Chao, please go back. Please forgive me for not being able to receive the decree!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said with a dark expression.</p><p>“What? If you don’t accept the decree, ruan tianjiao, do you want to disobey the decree?”</p><p>Sir Chao rebuked coldly.</p><p>“So what if I defy the decree? That incapable ruler is becoming more and more muddled!”</p><p>One of the officers said coldly.</p><p>How dare you! How dare you insult His Majesty! This is a capital crime!</p><p>Sir Chao pointed at the general and shouted.</p><p>“I think you’ll die first!”</p><p>The general exuded a cold killing intent as he looked at Sir Chao with cold eyes.</p><p>Sir Chao shivered. His face was pale and he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>If ruan tianjiao revolted in a fit of anger and killed him, he would have died an unjust death.</p><p>Sir Chao, please go back. 1 won’t accept this imperial edict. I will personally return to the capital and find His Majesty to clarify things!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said coldly. It was as if Sir Chao had been granted Amnesty, and he left with his tail between his legs..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
