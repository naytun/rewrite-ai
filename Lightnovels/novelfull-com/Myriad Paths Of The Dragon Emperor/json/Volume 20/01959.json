It’s that terrifying?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>The giant figure was too terrifying. Its strength was unfathomable, even more terrifying than a true Emperor.</p><p>“Could it be that the celestial Thearch has suppressed them here?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it carefully and felt that it was very likely.</p><p>The world here was originally suppressed by the heavenly Emperor mountain. It only appeared when the two great sovereigns fought and the heavenly Emperor mountain exploded.</p><p>It was very likely that he was a powerful existence suppressed by the celestial Thearch.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shook his head, turned into a ray of light, and left the place.</p><p>That kind of powerful existence was not something he could interfere with, so there was no point in thinking too much.</p><p>Lu Ming headed in the direction of the vast sea nine nations. A few days later, he brought ruan tianjiao and the rest back to the mingyan country.</p><p>“Heavenly flood Dragon, I’m leaving!”</p><p>In the palace of mingyan country, ruan tianjiao’s delicate body trembled slightly, and her eyes were a little complicated.</p><p>Although she knew that Lu Ming would leave sooner or later because they were not from the same world, she did not expect that day to come so quickly.</p><p>“In the end, he’s just a passerby in the mingyan country!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao sighed in his heart and collected his thoughts. He revealed a smile on his face and asked,” “Where are you going? Are we going back to outer space?”</p><p>“Do you know that there are other worlds apart from the ten thousand sea realm?” Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao thought for a moment, there are legends. It’s said that there are nine Worlds similar to the ten thousand sea realm. They are all connected. Only Saint emperors can travel there!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He knew that ruan tianjiao was talking about the world of the lotus flower.</p><p>In the world of the Lotus, nine petals were Nine Worlds.</p><p>“Do you know where the passageway is?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>legend has it that in the far west of the ten thousand sea realm, there is a void passage that leads to other worlds! Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“The far west?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. A storage ring appeared in his hand and he passed it to ruan tianjiao, heavenly flood Dragon, there are some Saint herbs, Saint weapons, battle formations, and cultivation techniques in here. Keep them. They will be helpful to the mingyan country!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao cast a complicated look at Lu Ming, then took the storage ring and said,” “Lu Ming, take care!”</p><p>“Take care, we’ll meet again if we’re fated!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, then soared into the sky and disappeared from ruan tianjiao’s sight.</p><p>“1 wonder if we will meet again in this life after we part today!”</p><p>A long sigh was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely fast. Like a flash of light, he flew toward the far west of the ten thousand sea realm.</p><p>The endless ocean and the islands flitted past Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current speed, if he used his full strength, it would be terrifying. He was much faster than the space-breaking flying shuttle that was 20 times faster.</p><p>After a few days, the ocean became more and more desolate. There were no more islands to be seen, only the endless ocean.</p><p>After two more days, a loud rumbling sound came from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that the void in the distance was in chaos. It was as if a huge abyss had appeared out of thin air and divided the sky into two.</p><p>It was the endless void turbulence.</p><p>Lu Ming approached and a powerful force hit him.</p><p>It was the power of the void. If one’s cultivation was not high enough, they would be crushed into pieces by the power of the void.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, it did not affect him much.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>Bubbles cried out. His body moved and he charged into the chaotic space currents like a fish in water.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped in as well.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The void turbulence was everywhere and it kept rushing towards Lu Ming, forming a terrifying cutting force.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the chaos laws throughout his body to resist the cutting power of the void.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos trembled slightly.</p><p>I’m afraid ordinary absolute Saints won’t be able to resist it after a long time!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles continued to move forward. Not long after, Lu Ming saw a huge vortex floating in the void.</p><p>The vortex was like a black hole, deep, mysterious, and terrifying. Even from a distance, one could feel the terrifying tearing force of the vortex.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave. It seemed that the void turbulence was not completely free of danger. This kind of pitch-black Vortex was very terrifying. It would be very dangerous if one were to enter by mistake.</p><p>Moreover, the vortex was constantly moving.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to move forward. He would discover a pitch-black Vortex every once in a while.</p><p>The void turbulence here was very long. After a day, Lu Ming and the rest still had not passed through.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, bubbles is going to cultivate!”</p><p>Bubbles seemed to have understood something and said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“You can continue your cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bubble nodded and sat cross-legged in the middle of the turbulent void. The power of the turbulent void flow acted on bubble’s body and passed through it, as though she was not in this dimension.</p><p>Lu Ming stood not far away from the bubble, shrouded in the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>While bubbles was cultivating, he could also make use of the power of the void turbulence to temper his chaos laws.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Seven days later, bubbles ‘body suddenly emitted a ray of light.</p><p>The light was very faint at first, but slowly, it became more and more intense and dazzling.</p><p>“This is … Spacetime light!”</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes and was overjoyed.</p><p>Anyone who cultivated a powerful law might be able to cultivate a type of law light.</p><p>For example, the stellar River had produced the eternal light.</p><p>Lu Ming had a deep memory of the power of the eternal light in the Galaxy.</p><p>Not only did the eternal light have terrifying offensive power, but it also had powerful defensive abilities. It could be used to attack and defend, and it could greatly increase one’s combat power.</p><p>But to want to cultivate this kind of law light, it was extremely, extremely difficult.</p><p>In theory, the ten ultimate laws and many King path laws all had the opportunity to cultivate the light of law.</p><p>However, in reality, only a small number of people were able to cultivate it.</p><p>The Son of Heaven who had comprehended the ten ultimate laws had a higher chance of cultivating it, but it was not a hundred percent.</p><p>For example, eternal Star River only managed to cultivate eternal light after reaching the great circle of the absolute Saint stage.</p><p>Back then, the death blade had not been able to cultivate the light of death.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cultivate the light of chaos.</p><p>As for the king path laws, it was even more difficult to cultivate the light of laws. Only an extremely small number of King physiques could cultivate it.</p><p>Once it was cultivated, one’s combat strength would skyrocket and one would be able to suppress heaven’s favorites of the same level.</p><p>Now that bubbles had cultivated the space-time light, Lu Ming was naturally happy.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that bubbles had swallowed a fruit from the divine Tree of time. In addition to the void turbulence here, they had combined and gained some insights before they refined the light of time and space.</p><p>At this moment, the space-time light was retracted. The bubble ended its cultivation and jumped onto Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Bubbles ‘cultivation was still at the late-stage absolute Saint realm, but her battle-power was probably stronger than before.</p><p>Now, even if Lu Ming were to go all out, it would be difficult to defeat bubbles.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and continued to move forward..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
