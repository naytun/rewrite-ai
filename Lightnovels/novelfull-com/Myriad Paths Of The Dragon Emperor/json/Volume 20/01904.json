It could deprive all the energy in the world, even the power of other laws. It could be gathered together to form a terrible attack.</p><p>All the energy around the deprivation divine seal seemed to have been deprived, forming an empty space.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>Various types of energy gathered on the divine seal of deprivation. With an ear-piercing sound, it turned into the size of a mountain and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong shouted with a thick killing intent.</p><p>Since he could not take away Lu Ming’s chaos laws, he would use absolute power to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>His sacred art had already reached ninety percent maturity, and its might was terrifying.</p><p>Furthermore, it was a magical power formed by stripping laws, and its power far exceeded ordinary laws.</p><p>He was very confident in his sacred art. At his age, it was rare to be able to cultivate a sacred art to 90%.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming’s chaos laws were powerful? under the situation where the mastery of the divine power was far lower than his, he would still be crushed.</p><p>what a terrifying super power Technique. I’m afraid Luo cangqiong has already cultivated it to 90%!</p><p>to be able to cultivate a technique to ninety percent completion at such a young age, he’s truly a peerless genius. His rank as tenth on the Saint King rankings is well-deserved!</p><p>As soon as Luo cangqiong used his super power, many heaven’s pride experts were shocked. More people looked serious as they felt the powerful pressure. “Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change. The Laws of Chaos burst forth and he pointed his finger.</p><p>A finger, incomparably huge and surrounded by the color of chaos, struck at the divine seal of deprivation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the divine seal of deprivation and the chaos finger of tribulation clashed in the air, creating a massive shockwave.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu…</p><p>The terrifying energy swept out in all directions. Some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t even stand still and were forced to retreat.</p><p>The divine seal of deprivation and the chaotic finger of tribulation were locked in a stalemate.</p><p>“Strip!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong let out a long roar and circulated all the power in his body. The law of deprivation burst out crazily. It deprived the energy of heaven and earth and strengthened the power of the divine seal of deprivation.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, is this all your power? You’re nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The Laws of Chaos circulated wildly, tangling with the Saint energy and surging toward the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger trembled, its power growing even stronger. The terrifying power caused the divine seal of deprivation to tremble.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s expression changed drastically. He felt that the divine seal of deprivation could not hold on any longer.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>His divine seal of deprivation had already reached ninety percent completion. Furthermore, it was a divine ability condensed from the law of deprivation. How could Lu Ming’s divine ability be stronger than his?</p><p>Lu Ming had just made a breakthrough to the Saint realm and he was cultivating the chaos laws. How could he be as good as him in terms of the mastery of super power?</p><p>Not only him, but the people around him also found it hard to believe.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s super power Technique was so terrifying, but in the confrontation of super power Technique, Luo cangqiong was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s power was beyond everyone’s imagination.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, I really can’t figure out where your confidence comes from. With your strength, you’re still acting so high and mighty.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued, and the power of the chaos finger of tribulation erupted.</p><p>Kachaa! Bang!</p><p>The divine seal of deprivation cracked and exploded with a bang. Luo cangqiong groaned and retreated madly, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Although Luo cangqiong’s super power had reached ninety percent, Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation had also reached ninety percent.</p><p>For magical powers of the same level, unless they were also in the top ten nomological laws, they were invincible.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was injured and he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and approached Luo cangqiong. His voice continued,” “Didn’t you want to cripple me? Come on, this bit of strength is not enough!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming pointed his finger again.</p><p>A chaotic finger of tribulation shot toward Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s face turned ghastly pale. He roared and launched the divine seal of deprivation again. However, he was injured and it was even more difficult for him to resist Lu Ming’s attack. In an instant, the divine seal of deprivation was destroyed. Under the attack of the chaotic finger of tribulation, Luo cangqiong screamed in pain and was sent flying more than 10000 meters away. He vomited blood.</p><p>His injuries were even more serious.</p><p>Not far away, Luo pokong and the other talents of the Daluo heaven sect were pale.</p><p>Even Luo cangqiong was no match for Lu Ming. They wanted to help but did not dare to step forward. They were afraid that they would be crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He stepped on the void and walked toward Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll make you die without a burial place sooner or later. I mean what I say!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared. His eyes were filled with crazy killing intent.</p><p>rely on you, or rely on the power behind you? that’s right, trash like you can only rely on the power behind you!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, full of sarcasm.</p><p>In other words, Luo cangqiong was no match for Lu Ming with his own strength. He had to rely on the power behind him.</p><p>also, you’ve forgotten one thing. Now that the power behind you is no longer here, I have the advantage. You shouldn’t have threatened me!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He did not hide his killing intent at all. He took a step forward and flew towards Luo cangqiong like lightning.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and activated his divine sword technique. Two pitch-black sword lights shot out from his eyes and rushed toward Luo cangqiong. At the same time, he pointed with his right hand.</p><p>The terrifying finger of Primal Chaos tribulation crushed toward Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to kill Luo cangqiong?”</p><p>how audacious! He’s simply lawless!</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>No killing was allowed in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. This was the rule set by the great emperor. But now, Lu Ming’s killing intent was unconcealed. His eyes were cold and he showed no mercy. He clearly wanted to kill Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was said to be lawless and reckless, but he did not dare to disobey the orders of the great emperor. However, Lu Ming wanted to kill Luo cangqiong in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>This was the real lawless.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Luo cangqiong bellowed. He did not expect that Lu Ming would dare to kill him here.</p><p>He fought back but was undoubtedly sent flying by Lu Ming once again. Half of his body was almost shattered. His aura was weak and he was severely injured.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly and launched another finger of tribulation.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s eyes finally revealed a look of fear.</p><p>Lu Ming had gone mad. He actually wanted to kill him. Was he not afraid of being punished by the great emperor? He wanted to die together with him.</p><p>He retreated frantically, but he could not escape Lu Ming’s lock. The terrifying aura of the finger of calamity of chaos enveloped him firmly.</p><p>“No, help!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared in fear. He was completely different from his previous arrogant look.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At that moment, a palm print cut through the sky and crashed toward Lu Ming’s finger of tribulation at an alarming speed.</p><p>With a boom, the chaos finger of tribulation exploded and the remaining power of the palm print continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He cast the prison suppressing heavenly art and punched out with all his might..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
