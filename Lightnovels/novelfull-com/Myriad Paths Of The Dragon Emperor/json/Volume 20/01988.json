It had been forcefully pulled up from the ground by the Almighties of various forces some time ago. It was a hundred thousand feet tall and ten thousand miles wide.</p><p>Each force had a huge Palace built on it, and each force had sent a large number of experts to live there.</p><p>This way, the forces of the various forces could quickly gather and effectively deal with the attacks of the foreign tribes. They could also effectively counterattack.</p><p>After all, ancient Moon Holy Land was huge, with at least twenty strong forces scattered all over the place.</p><p>It would be too difficult to gather the forces of all the major forces at the last minute. It would take time.</p><p>In that case, the foreign races would probably break through one by one.</p><p>With a common base, many forces and experts would gather, and it would be more effective to dispatch them.</p><p>Huang Ling and the rest brought Lu Ming and the rest around.</p><p>Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and others all cultivated in huge palaces here.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was a huge and magnificent Palace. It was the place where merit points were exchanged for resources. It was built by many forces.</p><p>right now, the strongest force in Gu Yue Holy Land is the Wind Clan of the Gu family. It is currently being led by the Wind Clan, with the other forces assisting!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go and hunt the alien races!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Then, everyone flew out of the ancient Moon Holy Land. Soon, they flew out of the outer area of the ancient Moon Holy Land and into the wilderness.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky above them, a figure flashed by at an astonishing speed.</p><p>That was an Emperor level expert.</p><p>The other race’s Emperor level experts would naturally be dealt with by the ancient Moon Holy Land’s Emperor level experts. The ones they hunted were those below Emperor level.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>After flying for some distance, they heard a violent explosion ahead.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Intense battle cries came like a tide.</p><p>In front of them, large groups of alien races rode on alien beasts and stepped on the void, fighting with human martial artists. It was extremely tragic.</p><p>At a glance, one could see countless figures.</p><p>In the sky, a terrifying light burst forth, and a terrifying pressure spread down like a mountain.</p><p>High up in the sky was the battlefield of great emperors.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and his group arrived, the alien races had their eyes on them. The main reason was that Lu Ming and his group were too young and eye-catching.</p><p>The leader of the cavalry was an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>leave the Emperor-to-be to me. You guys be careful!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed. He flew forward and a long spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>This long spear was obtained from Luo pokong. It was a monarch weapon.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air and instantly crossed the void. It broke through the destructive light shot out from the opponent’s third eye and pierced through the opponent’s head.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was killed in an instant.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could kill an ordinary Emperor-to-be in seconds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Xiangxiang Bella were also fighting with the others.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the spear trembled. The third eye flew out and was kept in Lu Ming’s storage ring.</p><p>The third eye of the alien race was a wonderful material for blacksmithing, and the proof of merit points exchange was the third eye of the alien race.</p><p>As soon as the Emperor-to-be leading them died, this group of alien races was no match for Lu Ming and the others. They were all killed in an instant.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>In the distance, there were even more alien races charging toward Lu Ming and the others. Their iron hooves stomped in the air with shocking power.</p><p>There were at least a few hundred alien races and seven or eight of them were at the Emperor-to-be realm. So many experts charged at Lu Ming and the others. Before they could reach them, beams of destructive light were already shooting toward them.</p><p>The destructive light was not only aimed at Lu Ming, but also at desolate power, Xiangxiang Bella, and the rest.</p><p>spatial barrier, chirp chirp!</p><p>Bubbles stepped in the air and pressed down with her tiny hands. The air around them rippled like water, forming barriers.</p><p>When the destructive light hit the spatial barrier, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. No one knew where it went.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and rushed forward. He shook his Emperor-level long spear and spearlight enveloped five or six Emperor-to-be cultivators.</p><p>The weapons used by the three-eyed God race were similar to the desolate race. They were all heavy weapons, either a battle axe or a sledgehammer. When they were swung, they struck at Lu Ming, blocking Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>However, the next moment, transparent bubbles suddenly appeared on their bodies and enveloped them. Then, Lu Ming thrust his long spear and killed the Emperor-to-be one by one.</p><p>When Lu Ming and bubbles joined forces, an ordinary Emperor-to-be would only be courting death.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four Emperor-to-be had been killed by two people.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A burly Emperor-to-be broke free from the bubble. A beam of light shot out from his third eye and rushed toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s spear shook and swept toward the beam of light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear vibrated and Lu Ming could not help but feel his arm go numb.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be charged at Lu Ming with a battle axe in his hand.</p><p>“You’re quite strong!” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This three-eyed God was much stronger than the other Emperor-to-be and was on par with the human Emperor-to-be with a superior-grade heaven spiritual body.</p><p>leave the Emperor-to-be to me and bubble. You guys deal with the others!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Lu Xiangxiang and the rest.</p><p>Then, she wielded her spear and fought with the strongest Emperor-to-be while bubbles attacked the other emperors-to-be.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others attacked those below Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Many people had gained something from their trip to the Lotus World. Long Chen and Huang Ling’s cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the absolute Saint realm. Huang Li had also reached the pinnacle of the absolute Saint realm. Luo Tianyi had even broken through to the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Luo Xiang’s cultivation was the same as Lu Ming’s. They were at the peak of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>With their strength, they could easily deal with the three-eyed gods who weren’t Emperor-to-be, and a large number of them were instantly killed.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang was surrounded by a green mist, and with a shout, a giant ancient tree was formed. It was like an ancient tree that supported the sky and pressed down on an absolute Saint lower tier three-eyed God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three-eyed God was killed by the ancient Greenwood tree, not even leaving behind a corpse.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella’s current cultivation was only at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm, but she could already kill an absolute Saint.</p><p>The combat strength of the Son of Heaven was indeed shocking.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already exchanged a few moves with the Emperor-to-be.</p><p>I can’t unleash much of its power with just the monarch weapon. I’ll use the ten thousand soldier scroll to melt the monarch weapon into my meridians!</p><p>Lu Ming changed his mind. He put away his sovereign weapon and switched to the finger of calamity of chaos.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He pointed his finger at his opponent’s battle-ax, causing his opponent’s body to shake violently. He couldn’t help but retreat, and the battle-ax in his hand was sent flying.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming pointed with his finger. The force of this finger was highly condensed, forming a tiny finger force that shot toward the other party.</p><p>The other party seemed to sense danger. A layer of black light covered his body and he threw his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the finger force pierced through the fist and went through the head of the man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
