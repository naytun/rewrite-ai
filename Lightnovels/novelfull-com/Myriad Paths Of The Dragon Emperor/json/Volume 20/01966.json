The Heng family will not let you off. If you let us go now, you can reduce your sins!</p><p>One of the Emperor-to-be from the Heng family spoke, his voice filled with arrogance.</p><p>“Reduce my sins? Why are you so funny?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This person from the Heng family was too self-righteous, right?</p><p>furthermore, the Heng family has never considered letting me go. It would be a waste not to kill the Heng family members!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Then, a combat sword appeared in his hand. He slashed out and killed an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The remaining Emperor-to-be’s face turned pale.</p><p>The Heng family was a great emperor force with a great emperor overseeing it. They were high above the entire Yuan mountain and were one of the peak forces.</p><p>Normally, there were not many forces that dared to go against the Heng family, and there were not many forces that didn’t care about the Heng family.</p><p>He had thought that since the Eternium had escaped, Lu Ming would most likely have some reservations. However, he did not expect Lu Ming to be so decisive and merciless.</p><p>“No, please spare me …”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Heng family was scared and started to beg for mercy.</p><p>“Hehe, is this the pride of the Heng family? Was this the pride of a great emperor? After your threat failed, you immediately begged for mercy. What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng clan had an ugly look on his face, but in the face of life and death, everything was meaningless. He continued,”Lu Ming, as long as you let me go, I’ll do anything you want!”</p><p>no need. 1’11 be worried if I leave someone like you alive. Kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming was very decisive. He slashed with his sword and killed the person.</p><p>So what if one of them ran away? he and the Heng family couldn’t alleviate the situation anyway, so what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve already refined the light of chaos!”</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen walked over with surprise and joy on their faces.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the happier they would be.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and looked around.</p><p>They were not the only ones nearby. There were others who were looking at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>The combat strength that Lu Ming had displayed just now had shocked them.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that they were on a platform. In the middle of the platform was a Hall with staircases in all four directions leading to the hall.</p><p>At this moment, many people were climbing up the stairs towards the palace.</p><p>However, as long as someone stepped onto the stairs, there would be flames on the stairs, blocking everyone’s way.</p><p>Even an Emperor-to-be would find it difficult to climb the stairs.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is the core of the ruins. I don’t know if there are any treasures in the hall, but we can’t fly up. We can only go up along the stairs. However, there’s a terrifying formation on the stairs that blocks the way!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>“The core of the ruins!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At the core of the divine time Island, they had obtained many plants that could increase one’s lifespan. They had also obtained the divine time tree.</p><p>It was because of the divine time tree that bubbles was able to achieve a breakthrough and cultivate the space-time light.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s injuries were only temporarily stabilized because of the divine time tree.</p><p>One could see how precious the divine Tree of time was.</p><p>What was in the core of this place?</p><p>“Let’s go up!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He took the lead and walked up a flight of stairs.</p><p>Bubbles followed closely behind Lu Ming. Feng Ling and Long Chen, the two Emperor-to-be from Phoenix Palace, also stepped forward.</p><p>As soon as they stepped on the stairs, a terrifying power of fire rushed toward them.</p><p>However, the flames at the beginning were not a problem for them. They advanced very easily. After stepping halfway through, the power of the flames became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered a problem. The power of the flames on the steps seemed to be different according to the cultivation level.</p><p>The higher the cultivation of the person, the more powerful the flame.</p><p>For example, the power of the flames that the Emperor-to-be faced was much stronger than theirs.</p><p>Therefore, halfway through, the emperors-to-be couldn’t move an inch. If they continued, they felt that they would be burned to ashes by the fire power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, bubbles, Huang Ling, and Long Chen were still able to move forward easily.</p><p>They didn’t stop and kept going up.</p><p>A moment later, they were on the stairs.</p><p>“So many doors?”</p><p>Huang Ling muttered.</p><p>This was because the palace here had many doors, a total of nine.</p><p>Of the nine Doors, three were closed, and six were open.</p><p>At this moment, their gazes moved. They saw a young man flying into a door. The moment he entered, the door closed.</p><p>“It’s Wei Tiandao!”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts skipped a beat. They all knew who that young man was. He was Wei Tiandao, who was ranked fourth on the Saint King rankings back in the yuan mountain Saint Academy.</p><p>However, the Saint King ranking had been rearranged, and Wei Tiandao had been pushed down to eighth place.</p><p>it seems that someone has also entered the three closed doors!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>there might be opportunities in these doors. Let’s each choose one!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Okay, then we’ll choose according to our feelings!”</p><p>Huang Ling nodded.</p><p>The four of them flew forward and each chose a fan.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the door on the far right. He realized that this door seemed to have a special attraction to him. It could make his array Dao laws feel restless.</p><p>After bubbles, Feng Ling, and Long Chen each stepped into a door, Lu Ming stepped in as well.</p><p>After entering the door, the door closed.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully.</p><p>This was a stone room. The stone room was empty and very wide.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was attracted by the wall of the stone room the moment he entered.</p><p>The walls of the stone room were carved with dense runes, which were extremely profound.</p><p>“This is … Runes of formation Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He cultivated array Dao laws and could tell at a glance that these were array Dao runes. Furthermore, they were extremely mysterious.</p><p>“These runes seem to have formed a secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up for a while and came to a conclusion. He then sat cross-legged and began to comprehend it in detail.</p><p>At that moment, in Lu Ming’s eyes, the runes on the wall seemed to come to life. They combined and transformed into countless possibilities. It was mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>He sat there for three days.</p><p>Within three days, Lu Ming had engraved all the runes on the four walls in his heart.</p><p>the nine scrolls of array Dao. These are actually two of the nine scrolls of array Dao, the annihilation scroll and the illusionary spirit scroll!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>Back when he had obtained the status of the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor, he had shamelessly asked for the sealed scroll, one of the nine scrolls of array Dao.</p><p>Back then, the Hunyuan sect elder had told Lu Ming that the nine scrolls of array Dao was a Supreme secret technique to cultivate the array Dao laws.</p><p>However, it had been lost for a long time. He didn’t expect that he would come across the other two scrolls of the nine scrolls of arrays here.</p><p>The power of a sealed scroll was extremely long and mysterious. During a battle, using a sealed scroll could greatly affect the opponent’s combat power.</p><p>The annihilation scroll, on the other hand, could use symbols to form the power of annihilation. Its might was astonishing.</p><p>The illusionary spirit scroll, on the other hand, used runes to create all sorts of powerful living beings. It was also a secret technique that was extremely powerful..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
