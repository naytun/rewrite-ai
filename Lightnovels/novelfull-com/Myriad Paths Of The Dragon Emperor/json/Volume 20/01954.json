The few people at the front stopped in the air and let out terrified screams. Their old and shriveled bodies became even shriveled, and their essence Qi seemed to have been swallowed in an instant.</p><p>Then, all their hair fell off and their clothes rotted. Their bodies seemed to have turned into skeletons, and there was no longer any aura on them.</p><p>The expressions of the people behind changed drastically as they retreated frantically.</p><p>But after they left, they all seemed to have aged a lot.</p><p>It had only been a few breaths, but all of them seemed to have aged ten thousand years.</p><p>Looking ahead, the few people who were flying at the front had already turned into bones.</p><p>“What’s going on? What was going on? My lifespan is almost exhausted!”</p><p>An old man whose hair was about to fall off shouted.</p><p>I’m not done yet. You guys are too impatient. The time God mountain is filled with the power of time. Any living being that goes up there will be deprived of time!</p><p>time is flowing faster in the time God mountain!</p><p>The sagemaster said indifferently.</p><p>time is flowing faster. Damn it!</p><p>The people who were charging forward roared. They had suffered a great loss this time.</p><p>As for those who were slower and didn’t move forward, they were secretly glad that they were a step slower. Otherwise, the consequences would have been serious.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, and some other young men did not step forward earlier.</p><p>They were still young, and things like lifespan were not attractive to them.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp…”</p><p>On Lu Ming’s shoulder, the bubble was chirping. Its eyes were fixed on the small tree on the divine time mountain.</p><p>“Bubbles, is that little tree of great use to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Yes, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Lu Ming understood. Bubbles was a space-time mouse and the small tree had the power of time. It was not surprising that it would be of great use to bubbles. But how could he get it?</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>“Can’t we go up the time God mountain?”</p><p>Someone asked in a deep voice.</p><p>If he couldn’t go up, then what was the point of coming here? it was better to explore other ruins as soon as possible!</p><p>“It’s not like we can’t go up at all. Follow me!”</p><p>The sagemaster then flew toward the side of the time God mountain.</p><p>Not long after, the sagemaster stopped and pointed at the time God mountain, there’s a Canyon here. Every three months, the power of time in this Canyon will drop to its lowest. At that time, we can pass through this Canyon!</p><p>at the end of this Canyon, there’s an altar. As long as that altar is destroyed, the power of time in the entire time mountain will be greatly reduced. At that time, we’ll have a chance to step onto the peak and obtain that time tree!</p><p>“Then why aren’t the people of your divine time island going up?”</p><p>Someone raised a question and looked at the sagemaster with doubt.</p><p>It was the same for the others. Some people’s eyes were cold.</p><p>If the sagemaster’s words were false or if he was plotting something, they would be in danger.</p><p>Many emperors-to-be and absolute Saints had lived for a long time and were very scheming. They naturally wouldn’t trust the sagemaster easily.</p><p>because we’re not strong enough!</p><p>The sagemaster replied.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flashed.</p><p>They were unable to refute the sagemaster’s words.</p><p>The cultivation level of the ten thousand sea realm could not be compared to that of the yuan continent.</p><p>On the divine time Island, the strongest experts were all quasi emperors. Furthermore, there weren’t many of them, so it was normal for them to be unable to do so.</p><p>“How long more until the power of time in this Canyon weakens?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“There’s still half a month!”</p><p>The sagemaster said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll wait here then!”</p><p>Someone was sitting cross-legged.</p><p>A portion of the people did the same. They sat cross-legged and waited quietly.</p><p>There was also a group of people looking around the divine light sacred mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles also wandered around.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, someone stepped forward toward the time God mountain, instantly attracting the attention of many people.</p><p>It seemed like someone couldn’t hold back and wanted to try it out for themselves.</p><p>However, that person was very cautious. Step by step, he walked very slowly.</p><p>When he stepped into a certain range, his expression changed, as if he was enveloped by a terrifying force.</p><p>This man was an Emperor-to-be, surrounded by the river of laws. He was covered in Saint power to resist the power of time.</p><p>Then, step by step, he walked towards the nearest plant.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The power of time of the divine time mountain would become stronger the closer one was to the peak. It was not completely impossible to resist the power of time on the outside.</p><p>As long as he could block it, he would be able to obtain some plants. The plants here could increase one’s lifespan and were priceless.</p><p>Immediately, many people stepped out and slowly walked toward the time God mountain.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>But not long after, someone shouted that he couldn’t hold on any longer. The person’s skin was slowly drying up, causing the person’s expression to change and he quickly retreated.</p><p>And the first person who had tried couldn’t even walk to the closest plant. He also couldn’t resist the erosion of the power of time and was defeated.</p><p>The same thing happened to the others. Even with their sovereign weapons, they were unable to resist and were defeated one after another. No one managed to obtain any plants.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I want to try. Perhaps I can use the power of time to cultivate! Chirp chirp!”</p><p>At that moment, bubbles spoke.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He also wanted to test how strong the power of time in the time mountain was.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and headed toward the divine time mountain.</p><p>Many people’s gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>They also wanted to see how far the son of chaos could go.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward step by step. When he stepped into a certain area, a mysterious force acted on his body.</p><p>That was the power of time, which was extremely similar to the power of bubbles.</p><p>The power of time was extremely terrifying. It seemed to seep into Lu Ming’s body and deprive him of his time and longevity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura burst out and holy power surrounded his body. The Laws of Chaos filled the air and blocked the power of time from the outside world.</p><p>The corresponding law to the power of time was the Law of Time. It was an extremely powerful King path law that could not be compared to bubble’s space-time law, and naturally, it could not be compared to the chaos law.</p><p>&Nbsp; thus, the moment the chaos laws appeared, the time energy from the outside world was blocked.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to walk forward, step by step, toward a plant.</p><p>He didn’t walk very quickly, but each step was firm.</p><p>The deeper they went, the stronger the power of time. But Lu Ming still managed to block it.</p><p>Bubbles sat on Lu Ming’s shoulder and seemed to be seriously sensing the power of time in the outside world.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was close to the first plant.</p><p>as expected of the son of chaos. He can control the Laws of Chaos and even block time!</p><p>Someone exclaimed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
