All the large groups fought and killed each other for those cultivation places.</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the cultivation land was the most important cultivation resource. It was of great help to one’s cultivation. Naturally, the competition was very intense.</p><p>And all of this, the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy didn’t interfere.</p><p>Ever since that day, the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy seemed to have disappeared. Only a few people were left to maintain the operation of the cultivation places.</p><p>After that, some small groups began to form alliances and congregate into large groups. One alliance after another began to appear.</p><p>The leaders of those alliances were all experts on the Saint King ranking.</p><p>Two months after the yuan mountain sacred Academy did not prohibit killing, dozens of alliances appeared in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>At the mountain peak where Lu Ming and the rest lived, the crowd gathered again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, should we form an alliance?”</p><p>Huang Ling suggested.</p><p>1 also think that it’s a good idea to form an alliance. Once we do so, we’ll have a legitimate reason to do so, and other people will come to join us and increase our strength!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang suggested.</p><p>that’s right. There will be people coming to join the alliance. It’ll be of great use in the future to get to know more people!</p><p>Luo Tianyi also said.</p><p>Following that, the others also spoke up, feeling that an Alliance needed to be established.</p><p>However, everyone was waiting for Lu Ming’s opinion.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming was the leader of the group.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news came.</p><p>In the eternal Star River, he had successfully obtained a set of formation disks in the Holy Saint battlefield, which covered a hundred miles of his residence. At the same time, he had established the heaven Emperor Alliance, and many people from small alliances had joined it.</p><p>“The stellar River has acquired a formation plate set?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>we’ve sent people to find out more about the formation plate on the Holy Saint battlefield. How’s it going? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>During this period of time, they had also been asking around for information about formation disks.</p><p>At this time, the effect of a set of formation disks was too great.</p><p>A set of formation disks could cover a radius of a hundred miles and could only be broken by martial sovereigns.</p><p>This was equivalent to having a base and not being afraid of being attacked. This was very important to an Alliance.</p><p>This meant that his safety was guaranteed.</p><p>Normally, he could cultivate in the cultivation land, but he couldn’t stay in the cultivation land all the time. After cultivating for a period of time, he would have to leave the cultivation land and find a place to digest.</p><p>There was no need to worry about one’s own safety when living in the area covered by the formation plate.</p><p>However, there were only four sets of formation disks in total. Once someone obtained one set, there would definitely be many people who would join them.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. It was obvious that Emperor formless had already expected this outcome. That was why he had left four sets of array discs in the Holy battlefield.</p><p>However, the absolute Saint battlefield was very large. During this period of time, many people had been looking for news of formation disks.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the star River was one step ahead and obtained a set of formation disks.</p><p>“During this period of time, we’ve been sending people to investigate, and we’ve already found some clues!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>alright, then we’ll wait until we get the formation disks before we form an alliance!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement. It would be most effective to establish an alliance after obtaining the formation plate.</p><p>Following that, they continued to send people to search for information on the formation disks.</p><p>On the other hand, the heavenly Emperor Alliance in the eternal Star River was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>The eternal Star River was the number one on the Saint King ranking and had astonishing strength. Now that he was the first to obtain a formation plate, naturally, there would be many who would come to seek refuge.</p><p>It was said that Luo cangqiong, Luo pokong, and Feng wuchen of the Feng clan had all sought refuge in the star River and joined the heavenly Emperor Alliance.</p><p>The heaven Emperor Alliance had become a giant existence.</p><p>However, the Galaxy did not cause trouble for Lu Ming and the rest because he could not figure out the death blade’s intentions.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, went to look for Luo Xiang alone. He planned to use the Dayan elixir furnace to help Luo Xiang temper his spirit body.</p><p>With Luo Xiang’s potential, he would definitely be able to temper his spirit body to the upper-class heavenly spirit body.</p><p>When Luo Xiang found out about the effects of the Dayan elixir furnace, he was also extremely shocked.</p><p>After that, Luo Xiang entered the Dayan elixir furnace to temper.</p><p>Just half a month after the eternal Star River obtained the formation disk, the second formation disk appeared. It was obtained by the divine fire Alliance led by a prodigy ranked second on the Saint King ranking.</p><p>The second on the Saint King ranking was called the fire Emperor. He was a genius of the fire Race, an ancient race.</p><p>After he obtained the array disc, many people turned to him. In an instant, the divine fire Alliance became a force second only to the celestial Emperor Alliance.</p><p>After half a month of continuous tempering, Luo Xiang’s spiritual body had also evolved into a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>When Luo Xiang’s spirit body evolved, it actually drove his cultivation and entered the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Luo Xiang’s cultivation base had already reached the limit of Supreme Saint, so it was normal for him to break through this time.</p><p>Luo Xiang had a King body and could control one of the king path laws, the fast and slow laws. Now that he had become an absolute Saint, Lu Ming and the others ‘strength had increased.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of good news arrived. They finally found the location of the formation plate.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately gathered all the people and headed to the Holy battlefield.</p><p>The Holy Zhi battlefield was actually a huge world of formations.</p><p>It was built by the great emperor himself.</p><p>When the yuan mountain sacred Institute first opened, only absolute Saints could enter to fight and cultivate.</p><p>But now, the absolute Saint battlefield had been adjusted, and even bright Saints could enter.</p><p>The entrance to the Holy battlefield was guarded by teachers of the Saint Academy. They had to pay a large number of raw stones to enter.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest, a total of dozens of people, paid the raw stones and entered a spacious secret room.</p><p>This secret room could be considered to have been reserved by them, and outsiders were not allowed to enter.</p><p>Entering the absolute Saint battlefield meant that one’s mind would enter, and their physical body would remain outside. This was to prevent them from being ambushed after entering the absolute Saint battlefield.</p><p>Everyone sat cross-legged, and in the secret chamber, inscriptions appeared and covered their bodies. The next moment, they found that their spirits had escaped into a strange space.</p><p>Then, they found that they had appeared on a grassland.</p><p>it’s so real. The cultivation level is exactly the same as the outside world. Even the laws are the same!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed for a while and realized that the conditions were the same as the outside world. There was really no difference.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This array world was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>Back in the divine Yuan Empire, when he had helped Ouyang Wushuang with the battle for the Crown Prince, the first stage was also to enter a world of formations. However, those who entered the world of formations would condense a body of a Lv 1 Martial Emperor. Their own cultivation and the power of laws could not be used inside.</p><p>But here, he could use it as he wished. The level of profoundness was on a completely different level.</p><p>The others who had never entered the absolute Saint battlefield also felt it and were amazed.</p><p>It was built by the great emperor himself, and it was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>there are many beasts formed by formations on the Holy battlefield. I heard that one of the formation disks might be in the violent ape mountain!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>As the Crown Prince of the shenyuan Empire, he could naturally mobilize many of the Empire’s geniuses. The information he had gathered during this period of time had all been arranged by Ouyang Wushuang..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
