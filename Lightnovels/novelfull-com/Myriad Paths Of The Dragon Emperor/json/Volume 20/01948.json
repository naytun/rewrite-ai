Lu Ming was only at ease after that.</p><p>With ruan tianjiao’s current cultivation of great saint lower tier, coupled with a medium heavenly spiritual body and an absolute Saint weapon, it was enough to compete with a great saint peak. In the vast sea nine nations, there was no opponent. It was enough to deter other countries and secure the throne of the alliance leader.</p><p>Half a month later, a warship came through the air and stopped above blue water country’s capital.</p><p>The emissary from the divine time Island had arrived.</p><p>The 100 people heading to the divine time Island were all prepared.</p><p>Most of them were young people.</p><p>That was because it was said that if one headed to the divine light divine Island, one would be able to receive guidance from a powerful existence on the divine time Island. If one was lucky, one might even be taken in as a disciple by an expert of the divine time Island and cultivate there.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was also on the list.</p><p>She was a rare heaven’s chosen. Naturally, she wouldn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to head to the divine time Island.</p><p>Everyone boarded the warship. Then, the warship soared into the sky and disappeared from the sea of the vast sea nine nations.</p><p>The speed of the battleship was astonishing, and it streaked through the air like a streak of light.</p><p>He stood on the warship and looked down at the vast sea below. In an instant, he had left.</p><p>This time, they flew for more than ten days before the warship suddenly slowed down.</p><p>“We’re about to reach the divine time Island!”</p><p>The emissary from the divine time Island spoke.</p><p>“We’re almost there?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned because when they looked around, there was no sign of an Island. As far as the eye could see, there was only the boundless ocean and no island at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the warship trembled slightly, as if it had passed through some barrier. The next moment, everyone’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>A huge island had appeared in the air in front of them. This Island was actually floating in the air.</p><p>On a floating island.</p><p>“So there’s a formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. There was a powerful array set up in this Sea region. Without special means, one would not be able to enter at all. Neither would one be able to see the divine time Island.</p><p>No wonder there were rumors that without the guidance of the emissaries of the divine time Island, no one would be able to find the location of the divine time Island.</p><p>The warship flew into the divine time Island and stopped at an empty space. Everyone disembarked.</p><p>come with me, I’ll bring you to your living quarters. In a few days, there will be experts from the divine Island to test you!</p><p>After the messenger finished speaking, he flew forward.</p><p>The group followed, and not long after, they arrived at a place filled with palaces.</p><p>At a glance, it was a huge Palace. Each Palace was separated by a distance and looked quite luxurious.</p><p>every Palace here has a marked name. All of you from the nine nations of the vast sea live in a Palace. Go and find it yourself!</p><p>The messenger left these words and soared into the sky, leaving this place.</p><p>Everyone descended and began to search the various palaces.</p><p>The six Kingdoms of the Quan ocean!</p><p>The three countries of the Ying sea.</p><p>Xuanling Kingdom!</p><p>They saw different signs outside the different palaces.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a Palace. The words on the door of the palace read: The vast sea nine nations!</p><p>They had arrived at their Palace.</p><p>However, the palace’s door was open, which made them slightly stunned.</p><p>Logically speaking, they had not moved in yet, so the door should be closed.</p><p>Everyone’s heart flashed with curiosity, and then they walked in.</p><p>As soon as they entered, they saw a few figures sitting in the courtyard and drinking tea. When they saw Lu Ming and the rest enter, they looked at them with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>“This place is already our residence, you guys should get lost!”</p><p>A tall young man waved his hand casually, as if he was chasing away a group of country bumpkins.</p><p>His tone made the people of the vast sea nine nations look a little unhappy.</p><p>everyone, it’s clearly written here that this is the palace of the vast sea nine nations. Are you in the wrong place? ”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao cupped his fists.</p><p>do you think I’m blind? of course I know that this is the palace of the nine nations of the vast sea, but now it belongs to our xuanling Kingdom. We have many people, and the original Palace can’t accommodate all of us. As for you, you can find a place to live in the wilderness!</p><p>The tall young man said casually.</p><p>The faces of ruan tian jiao and the others turned ugly.</p><p>However, at the same time, they were also shocked.</p><p>Xuanling Kingdom was a Kingdom that was extremely powerful and ruled a vast territory.</p><p>Even if the nine nations of the vast sea were to join forces, they would still be far inferior.</p><p>everyone, this is the palace that the divine time Island has given to us, the vast sea nine nations. It’s not very good for you to occupy it like this. If we report this to the divine time Island, even the mysterious spirit Kingdom will not be able to explain it!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said with a dark expression.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>The eyes of the tall youth flashed with sharpness as he stared at ruan tianjiao.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>Yuan tianjiao said.</p><p>“If you don’t dare, then get lost!”</p><p>The tall youth berated.</p><p>“Then we can only look for the emissaries of the temporal Island!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao said coldly and was about to turn around and leave.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The tall young man shouted and suddenly stood up. A powerful aura spread out and he scolded,” you really don’t want the face 1 gave you. You’re just a piece of trash in the vast sea nine nations, and you dare to threaten me!</p><p>With every sentence he spoke, the tall young man took a step forward. His aura became stronger and stronger, causing many people from the vast sea nine nations to have ugly expressions.</p><p>The great saint realm!</p><p>The tall young man looked so young, but he had already reached the cultivation of the great saint realm. It was truly shocking. As expected of the xuanling Kingdom.</p><p>The tall youth’s eyes were indifferent and aloof as he glanced at ruan tianjiao,” you’re a Pretty Woman. I’ll give you a chance. Kneel down and admit your mistake. Serve me for a few days, and I’ll let this matter go!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>A young man from Ming Yan country was furious.</p><p>The other party was clearly the one who occupied their residence. Ruan tianjiao merely said that he wanted to find an emissary from the time God Palace, yet the other party was already overbearing, actually wanting ruan tianjiao to kneel and apologize, as well as serve him for a few days.</p><p>What did they do wrong? it was clearly the other party’s fault!</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The tall young man’s eyes were like knives as he looked at the young man from mingyan country. Then, he took a step forward and pounced toward the young man from mingyan country like lightning. A terrifying knife light slashed toward the young man.</p><p>This was a sure-kill technique. If it hit, death was certain.</p><p>The tall young man was too overbearing. He wanted to kill someone just because of a word of disagreement.</p><p>At this time, ruan tianjiao’s figure moved, and the sword light in his hand bloomed, slashing at the tall youth’s Saber Light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blade and sword collided. The tall youth’s body trembled and he retreated a few steps. Ruan tianjiao had blocked his attack.</p><p>“How dare you fight back! I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>die! the tall youth shouted coldly, and an astonishing attack erupted as he charged towards ruan tianjiao. In an instant, he slashed out hundreds of blades, and heavy blade rays enveloped ruan tianjiao.</p><p>However, ruan tianjiao’s expression was calm, and a Dragon’s Roar came from his body. The Battle Sword in his hand slashed out, and a sword light turned into a huge Dragon Shadow.</p><p>The Dragon Shadow pounced forward and all the blade lights were shattered. The tall young man’s body was forced back a dozen steps and a trace of blood spilled from his mouth..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
