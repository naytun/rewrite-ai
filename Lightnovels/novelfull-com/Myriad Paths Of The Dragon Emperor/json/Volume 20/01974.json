His cultivation level was about to reach the Emperor-to-be realm, two levels higher than Lu Ming’s. Even his super power was stronger than Lu Ming’s, having reached 99%.</p><p>In terms of spirit body, even if Lu Ming had fused three chaos laws, he might not be completely stronger than the Galaxy.</p><p>He was born with an eternal body and was protected by the heavens. Once he entered the martial Royal realm, his spiritual body would directly evolve into a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>In fact, the children of God were all like this. Lu Xiangxiang’s body of life, Ouyang Moll’s body of reincarnation, and the body of death of the death blade were all inborn. Once they broke through to the Emperor level, they would have a high-grade heavenly spirit body.</p><p>Furthermore, because they were born with this Constitution, their spirit bodies contained a special substance.</p><p>For example, the body of life was born with the Qi of life, and the body of chaos was born with the Qi of chaos, so their spiritual bodies were stronger than the superior-grade celestial spiritual bodies.</p><p>Strictly speaking, Lu Ming could not be considered the Son of God.</p><p>This was because everything he had was acquired through cultivation, not inborn.</p><p>His spiritual body and chaotic laws were all acquired through cultivation. He was not born with the chaotic body.</p><p>However, the others did not know this. When they saw that Lu Ming controlled the Laws of Chaos, they called him the son of chaos.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s spirit body had cultivated three strands of chaos Qi. Compared to the Galaxy, he might have a slight advantage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s other advantage was that he had two Saint hearts and two types of laws.</p><p>However, this was not enough. It was not enough to make up for the gap between him and the Galaxy. Therefore, he needed a third bloodline to make up for it.</p><p>The third bloodline seemed to have endless energy. Even at Lu Ming’s current realm, he could still feel that the energy was endless. What he could borrow was just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded an endless murderous intent.</p><p>His eyes started to turn blood-red, and his long black hair also turned blood-red.</p><p>His aura was constantly rising, and he could faintly compete with the Galaxy.</p><p>Xinghe’s eyes narrowed and he said coldly,” borrowing external power is ultimately not enough to withstand a single blow. Kill!</p><p>He charged at Lu Ming as if he had teleported. At the same time, a combat sword appeared in his hand. It was undoubtedly a sovereign weapon. The sword light pierced through the air and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was even more straightforward. He lifted Luo cangqiong and threw him at the Galaxy.</p><p>Luo cangqiong hid in his armor and roared. He was extremely aggrieved.</p><p>He had completely become Lu Ming’s weapon.</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression changed as well. He flicked his wrist and the sword gleam changed. It cut toward Lu Ming from another direction.</p><p>However, Lu Ming flung Luo cangqiong away and crashed into the sword gleam of the Galaxy.</p><p>The sword gleam of the Galaxy changed again, but Lu Ming could always keep up with the sword gleam by waving Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let Luo cangqiong fight me if you can!”</p><p>Xinghe’s face, which had been calm all this time, was now filled with anger.</p><p>There was a ball of fire in his chest.</p><p>Lu Ming brandished Luo cangqiong, wanting to fight him head-on. Luo cangqiong’s status was extraordinary. He was the grandson of the great emperor. In terms of status, he was even higher than Lu Ming. Although the Heng family also had a great emperor, that great emperor was Lu Ming’s ancestor.</p><p>He was afraid that if he injured or killed Luo cangqiong, he would offend the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>of course, you have a monarch weapon, I don’t have a proper one. This is mine!</p><p>Lu Ming shook Luo cangqiong’s arm.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was dizzy from the swing. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>When did he become Lu Ming’s sovereign weapon?</p><p>“Then 1 won’t use my monarch weapon, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>In the Galaxy.</p><p>“You have a monarch weapon but you don’t use it? are you stupid? I’m going to use it anyway!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Luo cangqiong with disdain. He swung Luo cangqiong and smashed him toward the star River with astonishing power.</p><p>The armor on Luo cangqiong’s body was extraordinary. It was sturdy and immortal. Lu Ming pondered. Even a void Emperor would not be able to break it so easily. It was perfect as a weapon.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few blows. For a moment, Xing Chen was at a disadvantage and could not display his full strength.</p><p>Around them, many people were looking at each other.</p><p>“That Lu Ming is really shameless!”</p><p>Some people were indignant.</p><p>hehe, Xinghe’s cultivation level is two levels higher. How can Lu Ming not use some tricks? why don’t you say that Xinghe is shameless?”</p><p>Some people felt that Lu Ming’s behavior was very normal.</p><p>“Look, the platform is reacting!”</p><p>At this moment, someone exclaimed and pointed at the stone platform.</p><p>By now, many people had already died in battle. The blood of those who had died in battle was actually attracted by a mysterious force and flew towards the stone platform, seeping into the ancient altar.</p><p>The ancient altar was shining. Then, a blood-red Bridge extended from the stone platform to the other side of the abyss.</p><p>However, the blood-red Bridge only extended a section before it stopped.</p><p>blood sacrifice, it’s really blood sacrifice, but there’s not enough blood!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the scene, the battle cries shook the sky. Some of the more powerful forces began to kill the weaker forces. More and more people joined the chaotic battle. It was a chaotic scene. People were killed continuously and would fall here forever.</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes glowed as he shouted,” “Lu Ming, sacrifice your blood to the bridge!”</p><p>With that, the sword radiance of the Xingxing River surged. It no longer seemed to care about Luo cangqiong. The combat sword cut through the air and slashed toward Lu Ming with an extremely sharp aura.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up Luo cangqiong and smashed him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Battle Sword of Xingxing River hit Luo cangqiong’s body accurately, making a loud noise and sending sparks in all directions.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s body shook violently. He was dumbfounded by the powerful force.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed and he could not help but take two steps back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword-light of the Xingxing River was like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens, slashing at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated all the energy in his body and stepped forward. Luo cangqiong was like a black iron hammer, constantly smashing.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than ten blows in a row. The void rumbled and shook continuously. The terrifying force turned into shock waves that spread out in circles.</p><p>Some of the people who were closer to them were hit by the shock wave and were forced to retreat, their faces pale.</p><p>Many people were shocked. This kind of combat strength was terrifying. It was just a shock wave, but ordinary Emperor-to-be couldn’t bear it. How amazing was this?</p><p>What shocked more people was that Lu Ming could really fight against the Galaxy.</p><p>This made it difficult for many people to calm down.</p><p>The he family, the Daluo heaven sect, the only divine temple, and other powerful forces.</p><p>There were also ancient Moon Holy Land’s WAN family, golden Crow race, Sky Wolf tower, and others. Their hearts were in turmoil.</p><p>Lu Ming was now able to compete with the Galaxy. This rate of improvement was too shocking and shocking..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
