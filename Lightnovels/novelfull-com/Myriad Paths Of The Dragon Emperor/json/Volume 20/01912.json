He was holding a saber, and his eyes were as sharp as blades.</p><p>“Wei Tiandao!”</p><p>Huang Ling muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He had heard of Wei Tiandao, the fourth-ranked Saint King. He had a terrifying King body and an unfathomable cultivation base. He was even stronger than Luo cangqiong.</p><p>It seemed that the sky blade Alliance was established by Wei Tiandao.</p><p>“Your people killed our people for no reason. A life for a life, they must die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“They attacked us first, and we were forced to fight back!”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth called out.</p><p>nonsense, we came to the mystic ability purgatory Valley to cultivate, but you stopped us and said that the mystic ability purgatory Valley was already occupied by you. You attacked us and killed our people without any explanation. If 1 didn’t risk my life to break out, 1 would have died!</p><p>Huang Kong roared.</p><p>“You’re slandering me!”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems like there’s a misunderstanding here. How about this? I’ll give you half of the usage rights of the purgatory Valley and we’ll let this matter go. What do you think?”</p><p>Wei Tiandao said.</p><p>you killed our people and you think you can let it go so easily? is there something wrong with your brain?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated him directly, a cold murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Wei Tiandao’s face darkened. He was ranked fourth on the Saint King ranking, but Lu Ming did not give him any face at all. This made him feel murderous.</p><p>However, when he glanced at Luo Tianyi, Qiu Yue, and Huang Ling, he suppressed the killing intent in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want?”</p><p>Wei Tiandao said.</p><p>it’s very simple. All those who attacked us will pay with their lives. Also, the purgatory Valley will be ours from now on!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s expression changed and he shouted,” Alliance master, don’t agree to it! We’re only doing this for the Alliance!</p><p>Wei Tiandao’s expression was dark as he said,” “Lu Ming, your condition is too much!”</p><p>“Too much? Don’t you have to pay the price for killing our people?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 suggest that we minimize the issue. Once the two sides start a war, it’s not good for either of us. This time, you don’t have the death blade to help you!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao spoke with a hint of threat.</p><p>In other words, without the death blade’s help, you won’t gain any benefits from fighting me.</p><p>hehe, you really know how to put gold on your face. Why do 1 need the help of the blade of death to deal with you? since you want to fight, then let’s fight!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took a step forward. A violent aura burst forth and pressed down on Wei Tiandao.</p><p>At the same time, Luo Tianyi, Qiu Yue, and the others also released their auras.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wei Tiandao’s body exploded with a terrifying blade light that pierced through the sky.</p><p>Absolute Saint in the great circle!</p><p>Wei Tiandao’s cultivation had actually reached the absolute Saint in the great circle. No wonder he was ranked fourth on the Saint King ranking.</p><p>The people behind Wei Tiandao also released their auras. Two of them were also extremely terrifying. They actually also had King physiques.</p><p>The terrifying auras of the two sides clashed in the air, constantly colliding.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted and pointed his finger.</p><p>&Nbsp; a chaos finger of tribulation formed and shot toward Wei Tiandao.</p><p>Wei Tiandao unsheathed his saber and was about to attack when a transparent bubble suddenly appeared around him, enveloping him. His body froze.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>break! Wei Tiandao roared and unleashed a dazzling Saber Light, trying to break the bubble’s spacetime laws.</p><p>However, he was not Heng Xinghe. Heng Xinghe had an eternal body, with eternal divine light and the eternal laws, which could easily break the space-time laws of the bubble.</p><p>He only had a King physique. Although his cultivation level was similar to that of the Heng Xing River, there was a huge difference in combat strength.</p><p>How could he break through the spacetime laws in a short time?</p><p>“Heavenly illusion!”</p><p>let’s go! Luo Tianyi said and cast the sky illusion law. Wei Tiandao was immediately trapped in an illusion.</p><p>“Break! Break! Break!”</p><p>break! Wei Tiandao roared as Saber Light burst forth from his body, trying to break through the illusion and spacetime laws.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s attack had already arrived.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger landed on Wei Tiandao’s body. Even though Wei Tiandao used a blade light to block it, his body still trembled and he was forced back, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, as soon as he stepped back, another transparent bubble enveloped him. Then, Luo Tianyi’s illusion shook his soul again.</p><p>Although Luo Tianyi’s cultivation was at the absolute Saint late-stage, her soul was very strong, far beyond her own realm. Coupled with her sky illusion law, she had a huge influence on Wei Tiandao.</p><p>Despite Wei Tiandao’s strength, it was difficult for him to display it in such a short time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the Dayan elixir furnace appeared in his palm. It grew in size rapidly and smashed toward Wei Tiandao.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wei Tiandao was smashed into a daze. His body crashed heavily onto the ground and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The other members of the sky blade Alliance were shocked.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man and the others who had attacked him earlier all turned pale.</p><p>“Wait, stop!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao roared.</p><p>“What do you want to say?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and looked at Wei Tiandao coldly.</p><p>Wei Tiandao’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>It was only now that he truly understood how terrifying Lu Ming and the rest were when they joined forces.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming and the rest joined forces, they were suppressed by the Galaxy. It was not that Lu Ming and the rest were not strong, but the Galaxy was too strong.</p><p>Wei Tiandao only realized how terrifying Lu Ming and the others were after they exchanged blows.</p><p>With so many people working together, he couldn’t use his full strength at all and could only take the beating.</p><p>Furthermore, there were still other King physiques that had yet to make a move. If they really started a battle, they would lose without a doubt.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I agree to your conditions!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao said helplessly. He felt extremely humiliated, but there was nothing he could do in this situation.</p><p>no, no, President, you have to save us, you have to save us!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man screamed in fear. If Wei Tiandao did not save them, they would be dead for sure.</p><p>“He has to bear the consequences of his own actions. Let’s go!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao shouted and turned to leave.</p><p>The other members of the sky saber Alliance looked at the Golden-robed young man and his group with pity. Of all people to offend, they had to offend Lu Ming and his group of fiends.</p><p>After that, the other members of the sky blade Alliance also stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man and the others chased after the sky blade Alliance members in a frenzy.</p><p>However, Long Chen’s figure suddenly appeared in front of them. His eyes were cold as he threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man screamed as his body was torn apart.</p><p>The rest of the people had even lower cultivation levels, and were all killed by Long Chen in a few moves.</p><p>The people who had attacked him before were all killed.</p><p>The divine ability, purgatory Valley, was also under Lu Ming and the rest’s control..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
