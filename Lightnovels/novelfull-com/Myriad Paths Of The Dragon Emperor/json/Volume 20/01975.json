The law of deprivation circulated at full force and enveloped Lu Ming, trying to devour him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. He finally knew why the Galaxy had attacked him previously. Its purpose was to destroy the sealing power on Luo cangqiong’s body and allow him to regain his freedom.</p><p>“Eternal sword tide!”</p><p>How could the Galaxy miss this opportunity? in an instant, he stabbed more than a thousand times. Endless sword light, like a tide of swords, stabbed toward Lu Ming. All of them were aimed at his vital points.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming wanted to seal Luo cangqiong again and use him as a weapon. However, it was impossible. He might even put himself in danger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming let go of Luo cangqiong and retreated rapidly. He kept punching out with both his fists and illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared one after another, blocking the sword radiance that was coming for him.</p><p>As soon as Luo cangqiong escaped, his body flickered madly and he put a long distance between him and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll remember this. Just you wait!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s angry voice rang out.</p><p>I’ll remember this as well. 1 believe everyone will remember this!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Luo cangqiong was so angry that he almost vomited blood. His body trembled with anger.</p><p>That’s right, today’s events had been remembered by everyone. Soon, the news would spread throughout the entire Yuan mountain. In the future, when others see him, they would think of this scene.</p><p>He, Luo cangqiong, was a joke.</p><p>He was furious. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces. He could not wait to kill all the people who witnessed today’s events.</p><p>“You piece of trash, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with Luo cangqiong. He waved his hands in disdain and turned his gaze to the Galaxy.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was so angry that he almost wanted to fight Lu Ming to the death.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have Luo cangqiong with you now. Let’s see how you can stop me!”</p><p>The eternal light on the stellar River became more and more brilliant, as if it did not belong to this world.</p><p>“With one less trash, it’s perfect for a battle!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said calmly. He circulated his holy power to the extreme and was surrounded by the light of chaos. He looked like a god of War.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, charging towards each other.</p><p>“The eternal sword!”</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>A beam of sword light and a huge finger collided in the air and then disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and the Galaxy’s figures also collided.</p><p>Lu Ming slashed down again. An illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele appeared. It was as big as a mountain and carried an aura that could suppress the heavens. It suppressed the star River.</p><p>The sword radiance of the Galaxy slashed and split the prison-suppressing stele’s shadow.</p><p>However, he was faced with even more prison-suppressing stele’s illusory images.</p><p>With a wave of Lu Ming’s hand, nine illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared and were blasted at the Galaxy.</p><p>At the same time, countless inscriptions appeared on his left hand and spread toward the Galaxy.</p><p>This was the power of a seal, trying to seal the Galaxy.</p><p>However, when the sealing power approached the Galaxy, it couldn’t break through the eternal light of the Galaxy and was blocked. Then, the eternal light shook and countless runes shattered.</p><p>“My body is eternal, what can mere king path laws do to me?”</p><p>Xing Chen’s voice was heard. At the same time, a terrifying sword light burst out and shattered nine prison-suppressing steles.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>There was another sword radiance that pierced through the prison-suppressing stele’s shadow and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, when the sword light hit the light of chaos, it was as if it had hit an iron wall. It made an ear-piercing squeaking sound and sparks flew.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. He had borrowed the power of the third bloodline and crossed the gap between him and the eternal Star River. The two of them were engaged in a great battle.</p><p>Lu Ming used the prison-suppressing heavenly art and the chaos finger of tribulation at other times. In combination with the array Dao law, he exploded with shocking combat strength. He could kill an ordinary Emperor-to-be in one move.</p><p>However, the eternal Star River was indeed powerful. The sword beam pierced through the sky and the body became eternal. It was not weaker than Lu Ming. The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves in the blink of an eye and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow. The eternal light and the chaotic light trembled, and the two of them flew back at the same time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this secret technique of yours is indeed very powerful. However, the aftereffects should be very serious. I wonder how long you can last?”</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>He believed that the power of Lu Ming’s third bloodline should be a strange and terrifying secret skill that could increase one’s combat strength for a short period of time. However, such a secret skill usually had huge side effects.</p><p>“Try it and you’ll know!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Naturally, he would not explain.</p><p>The third bloodline had endless energy. Even if he continued to use it, it would not be exhausted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re no match for me even if you use your secret skill. I’ll show you my strongest combat power!”</p><p>Xing Chen said coldly. The eternal light on his body grew brighter and brighter, as if it was about to burn.</p><p>“The eternal God Bell!”</p><p>At this moment, the aura of the star River Rose sharply again. His body glowed brightly and finally turned into a big bell, enveloping him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The bell hummed, and a visible sound wave rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed abruptly. He had a very dangerous feeling in the face of this sound wave.</p><p>Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming cast the chaos finger of tribulation and pointed with all his might.</p><p>However, as the sound wave rushed past, the chaos finger of tribulation actually exploded inch by inch. The terrifying sound wave rushed past and continued to rush toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave as he retreated quickly. At the same time, he punched out with both fists. Pieces of illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared in front of him to block.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Phantom image of the prison-suppressing stele exploded continuously. Lu Ming’s body trembled as he felt a terrifying force acting on his body, as if it was going to tear his body apart.</p><p>Even the light of chaos on his body could not withstand it.</p><p>Lu Ming had to retreat a hundred miles before he could successfully resist this force.</p><p>“My God, is this the true combat power of the Galaxy? That’s too terrifying. Who can be his match under the rank of a martial Supreme?”</p><p>Lu Ming is going to be defeated. He’s not his match!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level is too low after all. It’s hard to bridge the gap between our cultivation levels!</p><p>In the surroundings, although there were people fighting, there were still people who paid attention to the battle between the Heng Xing River and Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
