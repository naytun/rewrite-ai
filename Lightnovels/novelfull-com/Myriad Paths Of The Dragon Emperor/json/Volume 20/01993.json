Today, you must give us an explanation no matter what!”</p><p>One of the wind race’s quasi-emperors shouted coldly.</p><p>“Explanation? bullshit! Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and told the other party to get lost, not giving him any face at all.</p><p>The people from the other forces all had different expressions and were secretly shocked.</p><p>The Wind Clan was an ancient clan with a long history. They had a deep foundation and were extremely powerful. However, Lu Ming did not give them any face at all. He even told the Wind Clan to get lost.</p><p>you’re too arrogant! I’ll cripple you!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be roared and his body turned into a gust of wind, rushing toward Lu Ming. With a wave of his hand, a dense wind blade flew out, extremely sharp, and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at him. He threw a punch, causing the air to tremble. The wind blades flew backward under the force of Lu Ming’s violent punch and hit the opponent’s body.</p><p>The wind race’s Emperor-to-be let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying back. He crashed into the wall of the wind race’s Palace and lay on the ground, half-dead.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength was terrifying. He had injured an Emperor-to-be with one punch without even looking at him.</p><p>where’s Feng wuchen? has he become a tortoise? tell him to come out!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The experts of the wind tribe could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you come to my Wind Clan, smash our gate, and even injure our people. What do you want?”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Feng wuchen walked out of the Feng clan’s Palace and looked at Lu Ming with an ugly expression.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold as to directly attack the Wind Clan’s encampment.</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward. He was very direct and could not be bothered to talk nonsense with Feng wuchen.</p><p>Back then, in the world of the lotus flower, the reason why Qiu Yue was injured was also related to Feng wuchen.</p><p>At that time, Feng wuchen and the experts of the Feng clan had joined forces with the people of the Daluo heaven sect to hurt Qiu Yue.</p><p>And now, Feng wuchen was even more aggressive. Not only did he purposely make things difficult for them, he even lured the three-eyed God race’s experts to kill them with a borrowed knife.</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent towards Feng wuchen had already reached the extreme. He could not bear it anymore.</p><p>He had to kill Feng wuchen today.</p><p>Feng wuchen’s expression changed. He couldn’t help but take a few steps back behind the experts of the Wind Clan and shouted,” “Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be so narrow-minded. When you wanted to exchange for resources and treasures, I said that 1 didn’t have enough treasures and asked you to come back after a period of time. You’ve harbored a grudge against me and wanted to kill me!”</p><p>now is the time for us to unite against the enemy, but you want to kill me and cause internal strife. 1 really wonder if you have already joined the alien race!</p><p>Feng wuchen directly put all the blame on Lu Ming, saying that Lu Ming was narrow-minded and even said that Lu Ming had joined the alien race.</p><p>Huang Ling, Lu Xiangxiang, and the others were so angry that their faces turned green.</p><p>He had seen shameless people, but he had never seen someone so shameless.</p><p>you’re talking nonsense. You’re the one who hates my master and US. On the battlefield, you deliberately led the alien races to kill us and wanted to kill us with a borrowed knife. Now you’re slandering us!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang cried out unhappily.</p><p>Many people’s gazes moved as they thought to themselves, so that’s how it is.</p><p>To be able to cultivate to this stage, they were all smart people. Previously, when Feng wuchen randomly accused them, not many people would believe it.</p><p>On the contrary, more people believed Lu Xiangxiang’s words.</p><p>It was no wonder that Lu Ming was so murderous that he went straight to the Wind Clan’s encampment. It turned out that Feng wuchen wanted to kill with a borrowed knife and deliberately led the alien race to Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>He was really despicable!</p><p>Many people were thinking this, but no one stood out. The wind race was an ancient race and was very powerful. Who would dare to offend the wind race?</p><p>There were also some people who were gloating, such as the Golden Crow race and the WAN family.</p><p>They would be happier if the conflict between Lu Ming and the wind Clan intensified and they killed each other.</p><p>They hoped that the Wind Clan would kill Lu Ming!</p><p>“Little girl, you’re talking nonsense. You’re full of nonsense. It was your master who told you to slander me, right? you need evidence to speak.”</p><p>Feng wuchen sneered.</p><p>it’s clearly like that. We can all testify!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang said.</p><p>“You’ll testify? What a joke, it’s more like you guys are ganging up to slander me!”</p><p>Feng wuchen sneered.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang’s face was red with anger.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly took another step forward and said,” “Xiangxiang, why are you talking so much nonsense with this kind of person? just kill him directly!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly accelerated and he rushed toward Feng wuchen.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Let’s join forces and take him down!”</p><p>The many emperors-to-be of the wind race were furious. In an instant, at least ten of them attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The light of chaos enveloped his body and he used the chaotic finger of tribulation, pointing ten times in succession.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a series of collision sounds, the ten Emperor-to-be’s attacks were broken. Their bodies trembled and they retreated.</p><p>There was a bloody hole in each of their bodies, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>The combined forces of ten Emperor-to-be experts were no match for Lu Ming and were instantly injured by him. Such combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>“Feng wuchen, you will die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming took another step forward, causing Feng wuchen’s face to turn pale. He could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. A figure walked out of the wind Clan’s Palace, and a vast aura filled the air.</p><p>Emperor might!</p><p>This was a martial sovereign!</p><p>Feng wuchen was overjoyed. Lu Ming could not do anything to him when a Martial Emperor attacked.</p><p>“Elder, Lu Ming is a lawless man. Not only did he destroy the Wind Clan’s main gate, but he also continuously injured our experts. Hurry up and kill this man!”</p><p>Feng wuchen shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Wind Clan’s Martial Emperor and said calmly,” you’re a martial Supreme. Try and attack me!</p><p>The Wind Clan’s Martial Emperor frowned when he heard this.</p><p>The hearts of the people from the other powers also moved. They thought back to a few years ago, to uncle Kong.</p><p>Lu Ming had an extremely powerful figure behind him.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current realm, if the other party attacked an Emperor-to-be, uncle Kong would probably not say anything. However, if the other party attacked a Martial Emperor, would uncle Kong make a trip to the wind tribe?</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t push your luck. It’s easy to break if you’re too hard. Leave. I’ll let today’s matter rest!”</p><p>The wind race’s martial sovereign said.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. The wind race’s martial sovereign’s words were equivalent to giving in.</p><p>This made Feng wuchen’s eyes flash with unwillingness. Today, he had a good reason to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming clearly did not appreciate it.</p><p>you can let it go, but I didn’t say that. Feng wuchen deliberately led the alien race to kill us. He must die!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold. The murderous intent on his body grew stronger, causing the temperature at the scene to drop.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going too far. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you have the backing of an old man. The wind race is fearless!”</p><p>The wind race’s martial sovereign’s face turned grave as he said coldly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
