Could it be that the continuous deaths of several people in Luoshui Kingdom were caused by this person?</p><p>For a moment, all the powerhouses seemed to have forgotten to speak.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and looked around. His eyes were as bright as the stars. I’m too lazy to talk nonsense with you. Take a blood oath. From today on, the country of mingyan will be the leader of the nine nations of the vast sea. Ruan tianjiao will be the leader. This time, the quota for the divine time Island will be decided by the mingyan country!</p><p>After the incident with the state preceptor, Lu Ming understood that there was no need to listen to these people’s nonsense. It was a waste of time to waste time talking to them. It was better to use force to intimidate them.</p><p>What?</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, the people from the other eight nations were stunned.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming in a daze, as if they were looking at a fool.</p><p>If he wasn’t a fool, what was he? He wanted them to take a blood oath and make the country of mingyan the alliance leader. He also wanted the country of mingyan to arrange the spots for the divine light and divine Island?</p><p>This was simply ridiculous, a big joke.</p><p>Did Lu Ming really think that he was invincible just because he could injure a perfected bright Saint with a single shout?</p><p>It was simply laughable.</p><p>Especially the people from blue water Country, their faces were particularly gloomy.</p><p>The leader of the Alliance of the nine countries had always been the blue water Country. What did the mingyan country mean? He even wanted to usurp the position of the Alliance master of the nine nations? He didn’t know what was good for him!</p><p>in my opinion, this kid is completely crazy. He’s talking nonsense here. Mingyan country is beyond saving. Why don’t we directly send experts to destroy mingyan country and support another person to rule mingyan country?”</p><p>The king of Luoshui Kingdom said coldly.</p><p>so much nonsense. Since this is the case, I hereby announce that the Luo Shui Kingdom is eliminated. They are no longer qualified to join the nine nations Alliance and are no longer qualified to set foot on the divine time Island. Get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the kingdom of Luoshui and said coldly.</p><p>Once again, everyone looked at Lu Ming as if he was an idiot.</p><p>This was especially true for the people of Luoshui.</p><p>“You’re not leaving, right? if you’re not leaving, then clean it up!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step in the direction of Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>“Arrogant! Kill him!”</p><p>The king of Luoshui Kingdom shouted coldly.</p><p>A few experts immediately charged out from behind him.</p><p>Two great sages in the lower tier and three in the great circle of the bright Saint realm were the only top masters left in the Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>The five experts joined forces and their aura was shocking. They wanted to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>“That brat is dead!”</p><p>A King of a certain country had a sneer on his face, but the next moment, the sneer on his face disappeared and was replaced with shock, extreme shock.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch, and the void trembled violently. The air was compressed together and then exploded, forming a terrifying fist force.</p><p>As the fist force crushed over, the five powerhouses of the Luoshui Kingdom were directly blown apart, leaving no bones behind.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard as everyone’s expression froze.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>After a long time, the king of Luoshui Kingdom let out a miserable scream.</p><p>These five people were the five strongest people in the Luoshui Kingdom. With their death, the strength of the Luoshui Kingdom would weaken sharply and become the weakest Kingdom among the Nine Kingdoms. Sooner or later, it would be swallowed up by other kingdoms.</p><p>His heart ached so much that it was about to bleed.</p><p>However, when he saw Lu Ming continue to walk toward him, he was frightened and shouted,” brother Cang, save me! This man is lawless! We must get rid of him!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Blue water Country ruler roared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear him. He took a step forward and appeared beside the king of Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>The king of Luoshui Kingdom wanted to escape, but Lu Ming took a step forward. The king of Luoshui screamed in pain as Lu Ming stepped on his face heavily. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body twitched non-stop.</p><p>“Impudent! Kill him!”</p><p>The king of vast Water Country was furious. He had already told Lu Ming to stop, but Lu Ming did not even bother with him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Two loud shouts came from blue water Country as two figures stepped out, and a terrifying aura bloomed in the void.</p><p>great saint peak, great saint perfection!</p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The people from the other countries were secretly trembling.</p><p>Blue water Country was indeed the leader of the nine countries. For tens of thousands of years, they had been sitting on the throne of the nine countries. Their strength was amazing. They were great saints in the great mastery and peak of the great saint realm.</p><p>Such an expert could destroy a small country by himself.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao and the other people from Ming Yan country couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, he was no match for a great saint at the peak.</p><p>But in the face of such an expert, they were powerless to help and could only watch.</p><p>The two blue water Country experts were approaching Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>“Let go of King of Luoshui!”</p><p>die! the great saint peak shouted and pointed his finger in the air. A terrifying finger force pierced through Lu Ming’s forehead.</p><p>“You’re seeking your own death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and then threw another punch.</p><p>This punch was even more terrifying than the previous one.</p><p>The void trembled and crushed over. The body of the great sage peak expert exploded directly. Even the great sage great mastery behind him was crushed into pieces.</p><p>At this moment, everyone present was trembling in their hearts and bodies. They were trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Lu Ming, unable to move an inch.</p><p>One punch after another, the great saint peak was crushed into pieces, just like the great saint initial mastery. It was as if in Lu Ming’s hands, there was no difference in the cultivation of those people.</p><p>strong, too strong. Lu Ming is too strong!</p><p>Beside ruan tianjiao, the voices of a few of his subordinates trembled. It was unknown if they were excited or excited.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what is your limit?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s voice was trembling.</p><p>The longer she spent time with Lu Ming, the more she realized that Lu Ming was unfathomable. It was as if Lu Ming’s combat power was limitless.</p><p>From the moment he knew Lu Ming, no matter what kind of opponent he faced, Lu Ming was always calm and composed. He did not even need to use a second move to kill his opponent.</p><p>The king of Luoshui Kingdom trembled under Lu Ming’s feet and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>At this moment, he was almost scared to death.</p><p>What kind of terrifying monster was this? there was no way to resist it.</p><p>I surrender. I swear to follow the mingyan country for the rest of my life, and regard the mingyan country as the alliance leader!</p><p>The monarch of the fallen nations shouted, afraid that Lu Ming would stomp him to death.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at him. He looked at the blue water Country and said, it seems that blue water Country also wants to be eliminated. Then I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>Then, he stepped out and headed toward blue water Country.</p><p>Cang Water Country ruler’s face turned pale.</p><p>A peak great saint was the most powerful person in blue water Country, but in front of Lu Ming, he was killed in an instant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s better to quit while you’re ahead. Otherwise, it won’t be good for both of us!”</p><p>The king of vast Water Country said.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m a little curious, how can you not give me any benefits?”</p><p>There was a faint smile on Lu Ming’s face as he continued to walk forward.</p><p>Blue water Country ruler’s expression changed. Then, he suddenly stood up and cupped his hands to the two old men behind him.”Two seniors, please kill this man.. Blue water Country will reward you handsomely!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
