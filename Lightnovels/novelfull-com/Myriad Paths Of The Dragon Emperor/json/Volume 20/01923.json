Therefore, a divine robe that could increase the chances of a Martial Emperor transcending a tribulation was extremely valuable to a Martial Emperor.</p><p>If he could survive one tribulation, he would be able to live for another three hundred thousand years. In these three hundred thousand years, he could go to some dangerous places to take risks and obtain opportunities. His cultivation might even rise to a higher level, and he might be able to survive the next tribulation.</p><p>The moment he Qian opened his mouth, he wanted to wear the divine tribulation robe. No wonder the Heng clan’s true Emperor had such a big reaction.</p><p>I m telling you, Lu Ming will return to the yuan mountain Saint Academy soon. When he returns, it will be impossible for you to take him down and get the celestial Emperor sword!</p><p>“You have to think carefully, which is more important, the divine clothing or the celestial Emperor s sword!”</p><p>He Gao sneered.</p><p>The Heng family’s true Emperor s expression flickered as if he was considering the possibility.</p><p>“The divine clothes for tribulation transcendence, give it to him!”</p><p>At this moment, another voice came from the Heng family’s Palace. Then, a white-haired elder stepped out. This person was also a true Emperor.</p><p>He Qian’s expression changed slightly. His figure moved and retreated a hundred miles, afraid that he would be besieged by the other party.</p><p>The he family and the Heng family had been enemies since ancient times, so he naturally had to be on guard.</p><p>he Qian, I can give you the divine clothing for tribulation transcendence, but I hope you don’t lie to us. Otherwise, the Heng family will kill you even if we have to mobilize all our forces!</p><p>The white-haired old man said coldly.</p><p>“Give me the divine clothing for tribulation transcendence and I’ll bring you to Lu Ming!”</p><p>He Gao said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll give it to you!”</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded and returned to the Heng family. After a while, he came our again and waved his hand. A storage ring flew towards he Qian.</p><p>He Qian received it and scanned it with his spiritual sense. His face revealed a look of wild joy.</p><p>This time, it was really killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>He could get rid of Lu Ming, make Lu Xiangxiang give up on him, take him as her master, cultivate the Four Seasons technique, and obtain the divine clothing for the Tribulation.</p><p>As long as his plan succeeded, he was 90% confident that he would be able to survive this disaster and increase his lifespan by another 33333 years.</p><p>“He Qian, can you tell me now? where is Lu Ming?”</p><p>The true Emperor from the Heng family asked.</p><p>“LuMing, stay as a guest in my mansion!”</p><p>He Qian smiled proudly.</p><p>“Let’s go, well go with you!”</p><p>The Heng clan s white-haired true Emperor said. Together with the previous true Emperor, they followed he Qian and headed towards the he clan.</p><p>After Lu Ming and he Qian separated, he frowned.</p><p>He did nor expect that the other party actually wanted to take Xiangxiang as a disciple.</p><p>A true Emperor taking Xiangxiang as a disciple was naturally a good thing for her.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not know why, but he felt uncomfortable when he was with he Qian. He felt that he Qian did not simply want to take Xiangxiang Bella as his disciple.</p><p>He Qian gave Lu Ming an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>Therefore, when he promised he Qian just now to persuade Xiangxiang, it was purely perfunctory.</p><p>we have to bring Xiangxiang and the rest away as soon as possible. As long as we enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy, we will be safe. But how do we bring them away?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly thought of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>After a while, he saw Xiangxiang Bella’s courtyard.</p><p>Outside the courtyard, Ice Dragon Valley master was pacing back and forth, seemingly very anxious.</p><p>The master of the ice cold valley was overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>The person who led the way also said his goodbyes and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did he Qian say to you? Is he asking you to persuade Xiangxiang to acknowledge him as her master?”</p><p>Ice cold valley master hurried over and asked.</p><p>that’s right. Valley master, you know about it too? ‘”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and answered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must not agree to he Qian’s request. Otherwise, Xiangxiang will be in danger!”</p><p>Ice cold valley master said anxiously.</p><p>“Valley master, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming s expression changed and he asked.</p><p>“He Qian is most likely making use of Xiangxiang …”</p><p>The ice cold valley master immediately explained that he Qian might have used Xiangxiang to cultivate and resist the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>“What? Detestable!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked after hearing that. He roared in anger and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He Qian wanted to take Xiangxiang as his disciple. He was not sincere ar all. He only wanted to make use of Xiangxiang. No wonder Lu Ming had a bad feeling previously.</p><p>not good. He Qian knows my true identity. He definitely won’t let me go. We have to leave immediately!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>At this moment, all kinds of possibilities flashed through Lu Ming s mind.</p><p>if he was he Qian, he would have killed Lu Ming directly. This way, it would be much easier for Xiangxiang Beila to join another sect without her master.</p><p>He could even go to the Heng family to seek benefits, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was extremely anxious.</p><p>Valley master, let’s go. We have to leave the Heng family immediately!</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming rushed into the courtyard.</p><p>When he saw Xiangxiang Beila and Tian Chui, Lu Ming immediately summoned the mountain and river diagram and said, Valley master, Xiangxiang, senior brother, quickly enter the mountain and river diagram. I’ll take you our of the he family!</p><p>“Master, this is…”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>“There’s no time to explain, hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. A white light flashed and Xiangxiang Beila and Tian Chui were kept into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you have any way to get out?”</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master asked anxiously.</p><p>Valley master , don’t worry. I have my ways. However, I need to borrow your clothes!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The valley master’s eyes flickered. Then, a set of clothes appeared in his hand and he handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming then put the valley master into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming s body began to transform into the appearance of the Ice Dragon Valley master. Even his aura was exactly the same.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly changed into Ice Dragon Valley master’s clothes and walked outside.</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master and the others were allowed to move within a certain range.</p><p>&Nbsp; as Ice Dragon Valley master walked out, he secretly glanced at him, but he only glanced at him and ignored him.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and came to a remote place. There were no longer any eyes watching him. At this moment, he happened to meet a middle-aged man walking towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced around and could tell that rhe middle-aged man had the cultivation base of the great sage initial realm.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the man without a word. When he got close, Lu Ming struck our like lightning and knocked rhe man unconscious. Then, he took off the man’s clothes and changed into them. Following that, Lu Ming’s figure began to transform into the man’s appearance.</p><p>The middle-aged man was thrown into the mountain and river diagram by Lu Ming. Then, Lu Ming swaggered out of the he family’s Gate.</p><p>Along the way, no one stopped him. Very soon, Lu Ming left the he family residence smoothly.</p><p>Lu Ming s expression changed slightly as soon as he left the he residence. He saw a few figures in the distance rushing into rhe he residence at a terrifying speed.</p><p>One of them was he Qian.</p><p>“There really are experts from the Heng family!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes were gloomy. He had seen the other two people who came with he Qian. They were two of the three true emperors from the Heng family who had entered the yuan mountain sacred Academy to capture him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
