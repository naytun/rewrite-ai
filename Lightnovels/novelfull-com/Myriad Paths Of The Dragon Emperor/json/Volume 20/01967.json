A month had passed while Lu Ming was in the process of comprehending the knowledge.</p><p>Lu Ming already had the foundation of one of the nine scrolls of the array Dao, the sealed scroll. Hence, he was able to comprehend the other two scrolls very quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that when he was comprehending, the sealed scroll, destruction scroll, and illusionary spirit scroll of the nine scrolls of the array Dao could be combined with each other. His comprehension of the array Dao laws was very fast.</p><p>Originally, his array Dao law’s maturity had already reached over 80%.</p><p>In this short month, he had comprehended three volumes at once. The speed at which his array Dao laws improved was simply terrifying. In a short month, it had increased from 80% to 90%.</p><p>Array Dao laws were King Dao laws.</p><p>it’s really profound. If the nine scrolls of array Dao are cultivated to a high level, they can even be fused together, and the power will be even more astonishing. As expected of a Supreme secret technique of the array Dao laws!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>it’s been a month. It’s time to go out. Anyway, I’ve already remembered it in my heart. 1 can slowly comprehend it in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked toward the main door.</p><p>Miraculously, the door opened automatically when Lu Ming walked to it. When Lu Ming walked out, the door closed again.</p><p>“Closed? Could it be that only one person can enter through each door, and the people behind can’t?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a few cries could be heard as Feng Ling, Long Chen, and bubbles walked over.</p><p>“You guys came out long ago?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously. Then, his eyes lit up and he looked at Feng Ling and Long Chen.”Your cultivation has increased?”</p><p>He realized that Huang Ling and Long Chen had both reached the pinnacle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, bubbles ‘cultivation seemed to still be at the late-stage absolute Saint realm. She hadn’t broken through yet, and it was unknown what kind of fortune she had obtained.</p><p>we obtained an opportunity in that secret chamber and made a breakthrough in our cultivation. However, this secret chamber can only be used once before it is closed!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze over and realized that the nine Doors were all closed. It was obvious that someone had gone in.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you get?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked curiously.</p><p>“A secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He then looked at bubbles and said,” “Bubble, what did you get?”</p><p>a kind of treasure. As for what it is, I won’t tell you. Chirp chirp!</p><p>Bubbles said in a mysterious manner.</p><p>“You little rascal!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>From time to time, roars could be heard coming from the cave. Who knew if that powerful existence would cause any trouble? it was better to leave first.</p><p>Huang Ling and the others nodded. When the roars stopped, they took the opportunity to fly up and cross the stone bridge above. Then, they found the right time and kept going up. Not long after, they rushed out of the cave.</p><p>In this area, there were other people who saw Lu Ming and the rest coming out of the stone room. Their eyes were filled with greed, but no one dared to take any action.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were definitely powerful.</p><p>“By the way, were you in this world when you first came in?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked after they left the cave.</p><p>yes, we have been exploring the myriad Beast Realm, but unfortunately, we have not gained much!</p><p>Long Chen nodded.</p><p>“Do you know where the entrance to the next world is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>yes, we’ve asked around. We were planning to explore other worlds after we finished exploring!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go to the next world!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone immediately flew in one direction.</p><p>The myriad Beast Realm and the myriad sea realm were completely different.</p><p>The myriad sea realm was full of vast oceans, while the myriad Beast Realm was full of wild mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the two Emperor-to-be from the Phoenix Palace flew all the way. After a few days, they arrived at the border of the myriad Beast Realm.</p><p>Here, there was also a void turbulence.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen took out their monarch weapons to resist the turbulence and the crowd stepped into the void.</p><p>Along the way, they met other people who were rushing to the myriad Beast Realm.</p><p>After a period of time, they passed through the turbulent flow of the void and arrived at another world.</p><p>There were also human martialists in this world. They had asked around and found that there was indeed a huge historical site in this world that had been passed down since ancient times.</p><p>They headed in the direction of the ruins.</p><p>However, they met a few familiar faces along the way.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, desolate power, and some Emperor-to-be powerhouses from the abyss Empire.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and the rest were pleasantly surprised to meet Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going to the legacy site, right?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“There’s no need to go to that ruin. It has already been explored. We just came out of that ruin.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang asked.</p><p>“We are from the myriad Beast Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“From the myriad Beast Realm? It seems that the eight worlds have almost been explored!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s expression changed. Then, he began to talk about their experiences and the news they had heard.</p><p>It turned out that Ouyang Wushuang and the others had already explored a few worlds. Moreover, they had also heard that the remains of the other worlds had almost been completely explored.</p><p>now, everyone is heading toward the Ninth World!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“The Ninth World!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The world of the lotus flower had nine petals, representing Nine Worlds.</p><p>When they first entered, Lu Ming observed that everyone would be attracted to different petals. However, there was only one petal and no one else. Lu Ming felt that there must be something unusual.</p><p>1 heard that someone saw a legend in one of the worlds. The Ninth World contains a big secret, and there is only one way to the Ninth World, which is the heaven abyss of the heaven abyss realm!</p><p>I heard that many powerful forces are heading to the heaven abyss realm, such as the Heng Star River and the Heng family, the he family, the Daluo heaven sect, and so on!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, we’ll go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Ninth World should have an extraordinary secret that should not be missed.</p><p>Moreover, there were some scores that needed to be settled!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded. Immediately, everyone changed direction and headed toward the deep Heaven world.</p><p>He couldn’t reach the heavenly abyss world directly from this world. He had to go through the other two worlds.</p><p>They crossed several worlds and flew for a long time. After more than ten days, they finally arrived at the deep Heaven world.</p><p>The heavenly abyss of the heavenly abyss realm was the most famous miracle in the heavenly abyss realm. It was easy to find out about it by asking around.</p><p>The heavenly abyss was in the North of the heavenly abyss realm. Everyone headed toward the heavenly abyss.</p><p>The heavenly abyss was a deep abyss that stretched across the edge of the heavenly abyss world. No one knew how long, deep, or wide it was.</p><p>From a distance, it looked as if this sky abyss had been cut out by a sword..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
