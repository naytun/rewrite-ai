Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>it’s actually the tear of life. This is a rare treasure that contains endless vitality!</p><p>“Indeed, it can save lives at critical moments!”</p><p>Many people were discussing with fiery eyes.</p><p>“It’s actually the tear of life!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as well. In the divine wilderness continent, he had once obtained the elixir of life and helped his father to heal his injuries, allowing him to embark on the path of martial arts again.</p><p>After that, he even used the life potion to help the nine suns Supreme Master form a new body. Even his clone used the life potion.</p><p>The tear of life and the water of life had the same magical effect, but their effects were completely different.</p><p>Comparing the water of life to the tear of life was like comparing copper and iron to diamonds.</p><p>He Qian and Lu Xiangxiang were in vip room six.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>She had a body of life, so the tear of life was very useful to her. It could greatly speed up her cultivation speed.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, you want to buy the tears of life?”</p><p>He Qian looked at Lu Xiangxiang and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>yes, but Xiangxiang doesn’t have that many raw gemstones. Let’s forget it!</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella nodded and said.</p><p>haha, silly girl. If you don’t have any raw stones, 1’11 give them to you!</p><p>He Qian smiled.</p><p>“That won’t do, I won’t take a reward without any work!” Xiangxiang Bella shook her head.</p><p>just take it as I’m lending it to you. You can pay me back in the future. Wait a moment, you can raise the price!</p><p>He Qian said with a smile.</p><p>“En, that’s good. Xiangxiang thanks senior he Xiao first!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella cupped her fists towards He Yan gratefully.</p><p>He Qian smiled and nodded, revealing a satisfied expression.</p><p>This was the reason why he had brought Lu Xiangxiang out to attend the auction. He wanted to take the opportunity to get closer to her and increase her impression of him. When the time came, Lu Xiangxiang would be able to cultivate the Four Seasons technique smoothly.</p><p>one tear of life. The starting price is two hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones!</p><p>The old man who was hosting the auction announced.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>“Three hundred thousand!”</p><p>Immediately, the price of the tear of life rose steadily, and soon reached a high price of 500000.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. Although the tears of life were precious, there was no need to spend such a high price to buy them.</p><p>“If Xiangxiang is here, I can buy it to help her cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. At the thought of this, he sighed.</p><p>He wondered how Xiangxiang and the rest were doing.</p><p>Back then, Ice Dragon Valley’s master had brought Xue ningxin, Tian Chui, and Xiangxiang Bella to escape. Later on, they had encountered danger, and Xue ningxin and Xiangxiang Beila had been separated. How were they now?</p><p>However, the yuan mountain was so vast, where could he go to find them?</p><p>The price of the tear of life continued to rise, and it soon reached 800000 superior-grade raw stones.</p><p>“One million superior-grade raw stones!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and melodious voice was heard.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>“This … This is Xiangxiang’s voice?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look at vip room No. 6.</p><p>Although Xiangxiang Bella’s voice in his memory was more immature, and this voice was more mature and had some changes, Lu Ming could still tell that this voice was Xiangxiang Bella’s voice.</p><p>“Why would Xiangxiang appear here? And in the VIP room, how was that possible? Could it be that I’m hearing things because I’m so eager to see you?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“One million one hundred thousand!”</p><p>After the bidder from guest room No. 6 called out the bid, the number of people who increased the bid decreased significantly. However, there were still people who increased the bid, and the price rose to 1.1 million.</p><p>“One million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>In vip room No. 6, the clear voice sounded again.</p><p>“It’s Xiangxiang, it’s definitely Xiangxiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that this was Xiangxiang Beila’s voice.</p><p>As for why Xiangxiang Beila didn’t recognize his voice, it was because he didn’t use his original voice. Who knew if there were any Heng family experts here who could recognize his voice?</p><p>Next, the tear of life’s price rose to 1.5 million superior-grade raw stones, and it was bought by Xiangxiang Beila.</p><p>He Qian smiled slightly. One and a half million superior-grade raw stones were nothing to him, but it was worth it to win a good impression.</p><p>The bidding continued, but Lu Ming seemed to be a little uneasy.</p><p>He couldn’t wait to go to VIP room No. 6 immediately to see if it was really Xiang Xiang.</p><p>After all, there were people with similar voices in the world.</p><p>However, the bidding was not over yet, so he could only wait.</p><p>The bidding continued. Lu Ming was even less focused on the following bidding. He was constantly paying attention to the people in vip room No. 6. auction item number two hundred and sixteen is a chaos gem!</p><p>The voice of the old man who was hosting the auction rang out, causing Lu Ming to be in high spirits.</p><p>There was actually a stone of chaos. Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Not only him, but the eyes of the others were also shining.</p><p>Chaos gems were born in the chaos before the creation of the world. They contained chaos Qi and were rare treasures in the world. There was actually a bid for them in this auction?</p><p>Everyone was staring at the old man with fiery eyes.</p><p>The Martial Emperor powerhouses in all the guest rooms could not suppress their feelings and revealed greedy looks.</p><p>If they could smelt the chaos gems into their small worlds, they would be able to make their small worlds more solid, more stable, and more powerful.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>At this moment, the old man slowly spoke again,” however, for some reason, the chaos Qi on this chaos gem has dried up!</p><p>“What? There’s no more chaos Qi?”</p><p>a chaos gem without chaos Qi is just an ordinary stone. It’s not of much use!</p><p>“I was excited for nothing!”</p><p>Many people shook their heads. Chaos gems were the most precious when they contained chaos Qi. Without chaos Qi, their value would drop by countless times.</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed a look of pity.</p><p>everyone, even without the Qi of chaos, the rock of chaos is still a rare material for smithing. It’s extremely strong and if it’s used as the main material, it can be used to forge a monarch weapon!</p><p>The old man in charge said again.</p><p>Many people shook their heads, it was just a material for a monarch weapon and wasn’t of much use. They might as well buy it directly.</p><p>The Emperor-level experts shook their heads. They had lost interest in the rock of chaos.</p><p>1 must get this chaos gem!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Although there was no chaos Qi in the chaos gem, Lu Ming cultivated the chaos law. Even if the chaos gem did not have chaos Qi, it might be useful to him.</p><p>alright, I’ll start bidding now. The base price is two hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones!</p><p>The old host announced.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>Someone immediately started bidding.</p><p>Although the chaos gem did not have any chaos Qi, it was still a rare treasure. Some people were curious and wanted to buy it to take a look. It would be good to keep it as a collection..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
