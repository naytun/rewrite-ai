His body exuded an extremely cold killing intent, causing the temperature in the mountain and river diagram to drop rapidly.</p><p>“He Qian, he family, i, Lu Ming, will definitely get my revenge!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and his eyes were bloodshot!</p><p>Although the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley had not known Lu Ming for a long time, he was a gentle person. Back then, he had always stood on Lu Ming’s side and helped him a lot with the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>He was a humble and kind elder who always thought for the younger generation and Dragon God Valley.</p><p>He had chosen to die in order to preserve the hope of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>He could die but Lu Ming and the rest could not.</p><p>Beside him, Tian Chui clenched his fists tightly, his killing intent incomparably thick.</p><p>“Grandpa Valley master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella hugged Ice Dragon Valley master tightly and cried.</p><p>Over the past few years, Ice Dragon Valley master had led them on the run. They had experienced too much and had long established a deep relationship.</p><p>But now, she also understood that he Qian had planted soul devouring insects in Ice Dragon Valley’s master long ago, but he had never told her.

Then, with a thought, he left the mountain and river diagram and rushed towards the yuan mountain sacred Institute with all his might.</p><p>He understood that now was not the time to be sad. Ice Dragon Valley master had committed suicide because of them. They could not let down Ice Dragon Valley master’s painstaking efforts.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at high speed, getting closer and closer to the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>In the he family, he Qian’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>“Damn old dogs, you actually committed suicide, but you won’t be able to escape from my hands!”</p><p>He Gao shouted in anger and said to the two true emperors of the Heng clan,” Lu Ming is rushing to the yuan mountain sacred Academy at full speed. Chase after him!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The three true Emperor powerhouses moved and disappeared without a trace, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at full speed. However, he did not fly in from the main gate of the yuan mountain sacred Institute. Instead, he flew from the side of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>There was a Heng clan Martial Emperor guarding the main gate of the yuan mountain sacred Institute. If the Heng clan Martial Emperor received the news and stopped him, he would not be able to enter the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>In front, the yuan mountain sacred Academy was already in sight.</p><p>The Saint energy in Lu Ming’s body circulated at full force as he rushed towards the yuan mountain Saint Academy.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the void behind Lu Ming shattered and a few figures stepped out from the spatial crack. It was he Qian and the two true emperors from the Heng family.</p><p>He Qian swept his gaze and saw Lu Ming flying at full speed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get over here!”</p><p>He Qian bellowed. He stretched out his hand and a huge hand formed, grabbing at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Explode, explode, explode!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming roared. The Saint energy in his body exploded like gunpowder, producing a shocking power that increased his speed.</p><p>This method couldn’t last long, only for a short time, and it was very harmful to the body.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could not care so much.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed increased sharply and he rushed out of the range of he Qian’s large hand, rushing into the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>not good, he has rushed into the yuan mountain sacred Academy. What should we do?”</p><p>The two true emperors from the Heng family had ugly expressions.</p><p>If Lu Ming rushed into the yuan mountain sacred Institute, he would be under the protection of the Institute.</p><p>“1’11 take him down no matter where I go!”</p><p>He Qian’s face was ferocious and filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to take Lu Xiangxiang away. He deserved to die.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang was related to whether he would be able to survive the next major tribulation. This was more important than anything else. If Lu Ming dared to stop him, he could not wait to cut him into a thousand pieces.</p><p>And that old dog, Ice Dragon, actually killed himself. He really got off easy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He Qian rushed straight into the yuan mountain sacred Academy. He stretched out his hand and condensed another huge hand, grabbing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This huge hand covered the sky and covered the sun.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming could not escape at all.</p><p>However, at this moment, a beam of divine light burst out from the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. The divine light was like a sword. With a slash, he Qian’s huge hand instantly shattered. The terrifying divine light did not stop and continued to slash towards he Hao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He Qian tried his best, but it was still useless. He was directly sent flying out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. His face was as pale as paper, and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood. His aura was extremely weak.</p><p>A hole had appeared in his chest, and the terrifying destructive power was corroding his flesh.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>He Qian muttered, revealing a deep fear.</p><p>a true Emperor actually dares to attack a disciple of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Do you think my words are nonsense? ”</p><p>An ancient voice rang out from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. As the last word was spoken, a sound wave surged towards he Qian and the two true emperors from the Heng clan.</p><p>The three of them had a huge change in expression as they frantically retreated. However, their bodies still trembled and they were severely injured.</p><p>Especially he Qian, his injuries were even more severe.</p><p>“If there’s a next time, I’ll kill!”</p><p>The great Emperor’s voice rang out again, and then it fell silent.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>He Qian bellowed in his heart. He looked at Lu Ming in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, his heart filled with unwillingness.</p><p>Lu Ming had taken Lu Xiangxiang away just like that. His plan was ruined.</p><p>Furthermore, he had just been severely injured by the great Emperor’s attack. His chances of surviving the next tribulation were even lower.</p><p>He was furious. He roared in his heart and was extremely unwilling. He wanted to tear Lu Ming into pieces, but he did not dare to enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The great emperor had already given the order. If he stepped in again, the great emperor would definitely kill him.</p><p>“Old dog he Qian, if you don’t die, 1 will personally cut off your dog head in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on he Qian from afar as his cold voice was heard.</p><p>just you? you better stay in the yuan mountain sacred Academy for the rest of your life and never come out!</p><p>He Qian said coldly.</p><p>“Old dog, just you wait. This matter isn’t over yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he moved and left the place.</p><p>“Hmph, little bastard, you’re far away!”</p><p>He Qian snorted coldly and planned to leave and return to the he family.</p><p>However, in a flash, the two true emperors from the Heng family blocked he Qian’s path.</p><p>“What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>He Gao asked with a cold face.</p><p>“What do you mean? We didn’t catch Lu Ming. It’s time to return the</p><p>Tribulation transcendence clothes to us!”</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor of the Heng clan said coldly.</p><p>“Return it to you? I’ve already provided you with information about Lu Ming, and you’ve seen him. The Tribulation-transcending Sage robe is mine. As for whether you’ve caught Lu Ming or not, it’s none of my business!”</p><p>He Xiao’s eyes turned as he said slyly.</p><p>Now that he had lost Xiangxiang and was injured by the great emperor, his chances of success in the next Great Tribulation were even lower.</p><p>Right now, the divine robe was his only hope. How could he hand it over to the Heng family?</p><p>If he handed over the divine clothing, he would definitely not be able to survive the next Great Tribulation and would die in it.</p><p>This was a matter of life and death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
