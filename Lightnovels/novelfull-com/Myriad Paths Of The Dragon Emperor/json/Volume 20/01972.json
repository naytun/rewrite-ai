He waved his right fist and the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele appeared, pressing down on Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Strip, strip!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared. The law of deprivation enveloped the battleaxe, constantly depriving the external energy to increase the power of the battleaxe. Then, he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The battle-ax hit the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele, causing a violent vibration. Although Luo cangqiong had blocked the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele, his body was constantly retreating. His face was flushed and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop his attack. There were nine shadows of the prison-suppressing steles in the sky, and they kept pressing down on Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Luo cangqiong could only try his best to resist. At the same time, he roared,” a bunch of trash! Hurry up and save me! Do you all want to die?!</p><p>Of course, he was shouting at the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>The emperors-to-be looked terrible and flew toward him with all their might.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s status in the Daluo heaven sect was too special and Noble. He was the grandson of a great emperor and had unparalleled talent. Even those void emperors and true emperors had to give him face.</p><p>What’s more, these emperors-to-be could decide their life and death with a word.</p><p>“No one will be able to save you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Countless runes appeared in his left hand and transformed into a true dragon that pounced at Luo cangqiong.</p><p>With the two types of nomological laws operating at the same time, Luo cangqiong was even more outmatched. He was instantly sent flying and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and appeared above Luo cangqiong’s head. He pointed out the chaotic finger of tribulation and attacked Luo cangqiong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s body was blasted down like a cannonball, just like Luo pokong.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming swooped down and caught up with Luo cangqiong. He held the monarch weapon spear that he had just gotten from Luo pokong in his hand. He poured his Saint power into the spear, making it hum, and stabbed at Luo cangqiong’s forehead.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect shouted in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply too audacious. He did not care about Luo cangqiong’s status at all. First, he killed Luo pokong, and now he even wanted to kill Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong was extremely frightened and let out a crazy roar.</p><p>He was unwilling, he was mad with hatred!</p><p>However, he would not beg for mercy. If he did not die, he would definitely kill Lu Ming in the future.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Emperor-ranked long spear pierced towards Luo cangqiong’s glabella with a terrifyingly sharp Qi.</p><p>However, just as the spear was about to hit him, a black metal token suddenly appeared between Luo cangqiong’s eyebrows.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear struck the metal token, causing sparks to fly.</p><p>However, this metal medal was extremely hard, and the long spear could not penetrate it.</p><p>The long spear trembled, and a terrifying force pushed Luo cangqiong to the ground at an even more astonishing speed.</p><p>However, as Luo cangqiong was falling, the number of metal plates increased rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it covered his entire body.</p><p>It was like a black armor that covered Luo cangqiong’s entire body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s body smashed into the ground, causing the earth to shake and a huge pit to appear.</p><p>However, the next moment, Luo cangqiong stood up as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Grandpa, hahaha!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong laughed with joy.</p><p>He knew that this was the protective Emperor weapon that his grandfather had secretly placed in his body. It could save his life at a critical moment.</p><p>However, he didn’t tell him in advance, most likely because he wanted to train him.</p><p>With the protection of the sovereign weapon, he knew that he would be fine. Lu Ming could not kill him.</p><p>“The emperor’s blessing!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect were also ecstatic.</p><p>“Will you be fine if you hide in the armor? kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He held the long spear and swooped down like a stream of light, stabbing Luo cangqiong’s head in an instant.</p><p>However, the long spear still failed to pierce through Luo cangqiong’s armor.</p><p>This armor was truly sturdy and immortal.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. If I don’t die today, you’ll be the one to die in the future!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared. His killing intent was extremely cold.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had almost killed him. This made his killing intent toward Lu Ming even stronger.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He swept his long spear and Luo cangqiong’s body flew out directly. He crashed into the wall of the big pit and his body sank into the ground.</p><p>However, the next moment, Luo cangqiong shot up from the ground not far away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and charged at Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Strip away the divine seal!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong cast the divine seal of deprivation in an attempt to counterattack, but it was shattered by Lu Ming’s finger.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the sealing scroll of the nine scrolls of array Dao. The dense runes enveloped Luo cangqiong and tried to seal him.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming grabbed Luo cangqiong’s neck and pushed him toward the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo cangqiong crashed heavily on the ground, creating another huge pit.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped on cangqiong Luo’s head, causing his head to sink into the rock.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared.</p><p>it’s really a turtle shell. It’s comparable to that fellow dandan’s turtle shell!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>At this time, in the distance, a little turtle sneezed and cursed,” which bastard is scolding me? he’s scolding me! Charge!</p><p>After that, the little turtle dashed toward a large tomb shrouded in clouds and mist, disappearing from sight.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to torture cangqiong Luo. He stepped on cangqiong Luo’s crotch, causing him to scream in pain and bow his body.</p><p>“Although the armor is hard, there is still pain. Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on Luo cangqiong’s crotch again.</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared like a beast. Inside the armor, his face was red with tears and snot.</p><p>“Release young master Luo!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect rushed over with all kinds of weapons and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of them took out their monarch weapons and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed one of Luo cangqiong’s legs and used it as a hammer, swinging it at the Emperor-to-be.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was waving a monarch weapon at Lu Ming, but when he saw that it was Luo cangqiong who was smashing at him, he quickly reduced his strength.</p><p>Therefore, the consequences he faced were miserable. Luo cangqiong’s body hit him hard. The Emperor-to-be screamed and flew hundreds of miles away. He lay on the ground, twitching.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming rushed into the sky, grabbed Luo cangqiong, and swung him like a hammer at the Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s armor was really sturdy and immortal. It was even harder than many sovereign weapon-level giant hammers. Lu Ming smashed it with all his might, and the power was amazing.</p><p>A few emperors-to-be with weaker cultivation were hit. Their bodies broke and they were crushed to death.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Daluo heaven sect had some concerns. Even though some of them had sovereign weapons, they didn’t dare to attack with full force for fear of injuring Luo cangqiong.</p><p>In that case, their consequences would be even worse..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
