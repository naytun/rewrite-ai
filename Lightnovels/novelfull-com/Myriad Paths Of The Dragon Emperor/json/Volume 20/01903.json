He was the great Emperor’s grandson. Who dared to speak ill of him in front of him?</p><p>In front of him, all of them still wanted to curry favor with him.</p><p>And now, he was going to take Qiu Yue’s memory again in front of everyone and get her.</p><p>Luo cangqiong stepped toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. The sky and earth rumbled. He raised a palm and clenched it in the air. Endless energy between the sky and earth gathered in Luo cangqiong’s palm.</p><p>No, it couldn’t be said that they were all gathered together. They were completely deprived by him.</p><p>The origin Qi of heaven and earth, as well as all kinds of elemental energy in the world, were seized by Luo cangqiong. They were compressed together to form a huge palm, which pressed down on Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this moment, the laws of yin and yang circulated around Qiu Yue’s body. Two curved blades flew out, intending to take Luo cangqiong head-on.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out as he took a step forward. Light spots lit up on his body. There were more than two hundred light spots, and a holy weapon flew out from each light spot.</p><p>On the way back to the heavenly Emperor City, Lu Ming cultivated the ten thousand soldiers art and sealed a large number of holy weapons in his acupuncture points.</p><p>Among them, there were eighteen absolute Saint weapons, one hundred and eight great saint weapons, and one hundred and eight bright Saint weapons. In total, there were two hundred and thirty-four of them.</p><p>With so many holy weapons floating around Lu Ming, he stepped on them and walked forward. He casually picked up an absolute holy sword, and the Qi of the Holy weapon gathered. He slashed out, and a vast sword Qi cut through the void, cutting Luo cangqiong’s big hand in half.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block.”</p><p>Luo cangqiong shouted and waved his hands continuously. The law of deprivation was activated and deprived the energy between heaven and earth. It formed a terrifying attack and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the middle of the Holy weapon and walked on it. His combat sword kept slashing out, breaking the other party’s attacks.</p><p>The attacks of the two were extremely violent and powerful. The surrounding people were forced to retreat.</p><p>Qiu Yue stood behind Lu Ming, her two curved daggers dancing in the air. She did not retreat at all.</p><p>If the situation changed, she would not hesitate to take action.</p><p>Back in the blazing sun Empire, she was weak and could not help Lu Ming. Now that she had the ability, she would stay by Lu Ming’s side and protect him.</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix was heard. Huang Ling was bathed in the unperishable flame. She stepped forward and stood beside Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at Huang Ling and smiled kindly. Huang Ling was stunned for a moment, but she returned the smile.</p><p>After that, Long Chen and desolate li both stepped forward.</p><p>“Lu Ming and Luo cangqiong have started a war. Who do you think will win?” it’s hard to say. Lu Ming has just broken through to the absolute Saint realm, but Luo cangqiong’s cultivation has already reached the complete absolute Saint realm. Although Lu Ming was able to suppress Luo pokong, who was in the initial absolute Saint realm, when he was only a great saint, and his combat strength was amazing, Luo cangqiong is not Luo pokong!</p><p>that’s right. Even the king body has different strengths. Luo cangqiong’s combat power is extremely terrifying, and his law of deprivation is extremely powerful. Even if it’s not as powerful as the ten strongest laws, it’s still one of the top few among the king path laws!</p><p>the son of chaos can not be measured with common sense. This battle is hard to say!</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all guessing who would win, but no one could say for sure.</p><p>Some people thought that Luo cangqiong was stronger. After all, Luo cangqiong’s cultivation was two levels higher, and the law of deprivation was very terrifying. His combat strength must be above Lu Ming’s.</p><p>However, some people deduced that Lu Ming might not be weaker than Luo cangqiong based on his previous battle results.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>“The blade of deprivation!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong did not continue to deprive the energy between heaven and earth. Instead, he formed a huge saber with the law of deprivation and slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming gathered the Holy weapons together. The Qi of combat weapons burst forth and blasted toward Luo cangqiong.</p><p>However, when it collided with Luo cangqiong’s saber, his expression changed slightly.</p><p>This was because he felt that there was a terrifying power of deprivation in Luo cangqiong’s saber. It was going to deprive the combat weapon Qi, and even the spiritual consciousness attached to Lu Ming’s holy weapon. Even the spirituality of the Holy weapon itself was going to be deprived and turned into scrap iron.</p><p>After taking away the energy from Lu Ming’s Saint weapon, Luo cangqiong’s saber was much more powerful. With a shake, all the Saint weapons were knocked back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than two hundred holy weapons gathered behind Lu Ming, forming a pair of huge wings. The Qi of the Holy weapons gathered on the combat sword in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in the air and charged at Luo cangqiong, his sword slashing out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The combat sword collided with Luo cangqiong’s combat blade.</p><p>“Strip him of his power!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong operated the law of deprivation, trying to deprive Lu Ming of his power of law and even his Saint energy.</p><p>However, the next moment, Luo cangqiong’s expression changed drastically. His body trembled and he couldn’t help but retreat several thousand meters in the void.</p><p>“Can you take away the Laws of Chaos?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly as he continued to charge at Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Just now, he had covered the sword with a layer of chaotic law.</p><p>The chaos law was one of the ten Supreme laws. Although the law of deprivation was domineering, it could not deprive the chaos law.</p><p>“The blade of deprivation!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s face was gloomy. He waved his hands and kept forming nine sabers. They rushed toward Lu Ming from different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming simply put away all his holy weapons and used the prison suppressing heaven technique to resist.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Lu Ming threw nine punches in a row and the nine shadows of the prison-suppressing steles appeared, clashing with the nine blades of deprivation.</p><p>“Strip, strip!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong shouted and wanted to strip Lu Ming of his Saint energy. However, the prison-suppressing heavenly technique was reinforced by the Laws of Chaos and he could not strip it away.</p><p>Moreover, the power of the prison suppressing heavenly art was very strange. Lu Ming had a feeling that even without the chaos law, the other party would not be able to strip the power of the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s shadow suppressed the heaven and earth, knocking Luo cangqiong’s nine blades of deprivation away.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong’s nomological laws have been restrained!”</p><p>the law of chaos is the king of all laws. The law of deprivation can’t affect it at all. The advantage of the law of deprivation can’t be exerted at all. Luo cangqiong is in danger in this battle!</p><p>Some people were discussing and expressing their opinions.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s law of deprivation was extremely overbearing. It could deprive everything, even other laws.</p><p>An ordinary King body would be restricted by Luo cangqiong’s deprivation law.</p><p>However, against Lu Ming, Luo cangqiong’s law of deprivation could not exert its advantage at all.</p><p>if I can’t take it away from you, then I’ll use absolute power to crush you and take away your divine seal!</p><p>Luo cangqiong waved his hand, and the nine blades of deprivation collapsed. Then, Luo cangqiong formed a seal with his palm and turned it into a big seal.</p><p>This huge seal was pitch-black, and when it appeared in the sky, endless heaven and earth energy poured into it. The huge seal emitted a terrifying aura..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
