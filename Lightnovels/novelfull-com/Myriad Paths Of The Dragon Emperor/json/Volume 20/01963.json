It was staring at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>In front of him was the middle-aged burly man. He was also looking at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>The man and the giant lizard exuded a powerful aura. They were both Emperor-to-be existences.</p><p>Through the traces at the scene, Lu Ming understood.</p><p>The battle between the middle-aged man and the giant lizard must have caused a spatial fluctuation, causing the space to become fragile. They must have found out about it and attacked with all their might. With their cooperation, they pierced through the space and appeared here.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the giant lizard roared angrily, treating Lu Ming as the burly man’s ally. It took a step forward and flames burst out of its body. It spat out a fireball at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele appeared, destroying the giant lizard’s fireball.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The giant lizard stomped on the ground and the cave rumbled as it pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sharp claws tore through the air, as sharp as divine blades.</p><p>At the same time, it bit at Lu Ming with its fangs.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold. He was already filled with anger. The moment the giant lizard appeared, it charged at him. This made Lu Ming even angrier.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Saint energy boiled as he threw a few punches at the giant lizard.</p><p>Although the giant lizard had the combat strength of an Emperor-to-be, it was still no match for Lu Ming in a head-on collision. It was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming leaped high and looked down from above. He punched the giant lizard’s head, causing it to crash heavily onto the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant lizard’s head hit the ground and it let out a loud roar. Its scaly tail whipped at Lu Ming like an iron whip.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the giant lizard’s tail, lifted it up, and threw it towards the entrance of the cave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant lizard was thrown out of the cave by Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying roar came from outside the cave. This roar did not come from the giant lizard, but from below the cave.</p><p>The roar was so powerful that Lu Ming’s eardrums vibrated as if there was a Supreme demon there.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw the giant lizard let out a terrified roar and its body fell rapidly, as if it was attracted by some force.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Then, the earth-shaking roars continued to ring out.</p><p>A terrifying sound wave reverberated in the area.</p><p>The middle-aged burly man’s expression was grave. He kept his distance from Lu Ming, not daring to go out at all.</p><p>“Senior, what’s that outside?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>The middle-aged man shook his head.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“The myriad Beast Realm!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said. He sized Lu Ming up and said, you should be the son of chaos of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, right? ”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. It seemed that they were still in one of the Nine Worlds of the world of the lotus flower. They had not gone too far.</p><p>At this moment, the roars outside stopped. Lu Ming was about to ask again when the middle-aged man rushed out of the cave and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He followed them to the entrance of the cave and looked outside. His eyes widened involuntarily.</p><p>The scene outside was extremely magnificent.</p><p>The place he was in looked like the crater of a volcano, or a huge cave that led underground.</p><p>He was standing on one of the walls of the cave. As far as the eye could see, the surrounding walls of the cave were densely packed with caves.</p><p>In the middle of the cave, there were stone bridges that were connected to each other.</p><p>The cave went all the way down, and it was dark down there.</p><p>The roar just now had come from below.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the middle-aged burly man leap onto a stone bridge and rush into a cave diagonally opposite him, disappearing.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around again and realized that there were indeed figures flickering in some caves.</p><p>could it be that this place is a historical site of the myriad Beast Realm, and many outsiders are exploring here? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He saw some figures flickering out of some caves. They seemed to be very cautious. They landed on the stone bridges and waited cautiously for a moment. Then, they jumped down to the stone bridge below. Just like that, they continued to go down and explore the caves below.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, another earth-shattering roar sounded from the depths of the cave.</p><p>Along with the roar, a terrifying suction force came from the depths of the cave, as if it wanted to swallow everything.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A terrified scream was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming saw an absolute Saint powerhouse who happened to be in the air and did not land on the stone bridge. Instead, he was swallowed by the force and disappeared into the endless abyss.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. What was down there? even an absolute Saint could not resist it.</p><p>The giant lizard from before was also devoured by the force.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that those who landed on the stone bridge were fine. It was as if the stone bridge could block the devouring power.</p><p>No wonder those people were so careful when they jumped on the stone bridge.</p><p>“This place is full of danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and looked around. He realized that the cave he was in had no other exit. The only way out was the cave in front of him.</p><p>let’s rest here for a while, bubble. You should recover first!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Pao Pao.</p><p>Previously, in the void storm, bubble had circulated her spacetime laws to resist and had expended a lot of energy. This was a good opportunity for her to recuperate and rest.</p><p>“Okay, brother Lu Ming, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Paopao nodded and took out a large number of origin stones and Saint herbs to start recovering.</p><p>Lu Ming also sat cross-legged, devouring the rough stone to regulate his breathing.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s condition had returned to its peak.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The stone of chaos appeared in his hand.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had used the rock of chaos to block the blow from Luo cangqiong’s sovereign weapon. At that time, Lu Ming had heard an obscure sound, which seemed to be the sound of the rock of chaos cracking.</p><p>Lu Ming took it out and examined it. Indeed, there was a crack on the rock of chaos.</p><p>the rock of chaos is indestructible, but it was actually cracked. That Luo cangqiong’s monarch weapon is really powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and then thought that since the chaos gem had cracked, he might as well break it open and take a look.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming circulated all the energy in his body, grabbed the chaos gem, and tried to break it.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The rock of chaos produced an even louder sound, and the crack became even bigger.</p><p>“As expected, it can be pried open!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. If not for the crack that had appeared on the rock of chaos, it would not have been able to be opened.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to exert force. A moment later, the rock of chaos was completely broken into two halves.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>Inside the rock of chaos, there were two small crystals that fell to the ground.</p><p>“This is … Chaos Crystal!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up at the sight of the two crystals..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
