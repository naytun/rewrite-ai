Some places even began to crack, and the entire divine time Island was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“Come and help me cut off this damn demon suppression chain!”</p><p>The giant figure spoke.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord!”</p><p>yes, master! evil spirit and the others bowed and accepted the order. They then exploded with terrifying attacks at the chains.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cultivation of these figures was extremely terrifying. Although they hadn’t reached the great emperor realm, they weren’t far from it. All kinds of attacks landed, and the chains shook and sparks flew.</p><p>With the help of the giant figure, one of the chains broke with a clang.</p><p>hahaha, I’m finally going to be born. Hengyu, if you didn’t kill me back then and used my power to suppress the void passage, you’d be too smart for your own good. 1’11 make you regret this. Hahaha!</p><p>&Nbsp;” hahahahaha! the giant figure laughed crazily, its aura even more astonishing as it struggled.</p><p>Although Emperor formless was anxious, he was being held back by the demon spirit religion master and was unable to stop him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of chains breaking could be heard. Then, a terrifying aura shot up into the sky, shaking the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the entire divine time Island crumbled apart as a massive figure stepped out.</p><p>As he walked forward, his figure began to shrink. Finally, he became the size of a normal person, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>This was a dark-skinned, middle-aged man. He was naked, and the aura he gave off was extremely shocking.

When he joined forces with the demon spirit religion master, Emperor Wu Xiang was at a disadvantage.</p><p>And in another world, the myriad Beast Realm.</p><p>Another figure descended from the cave where Lu Ming obtained two of the nine sealed scrolls.</p><p>This person’s aura was extremely shocking. He was also a great emperor.</p><p>Moreover, it was not the great emperor from the he family, the Heng family, or the Daluo heaven sect, but an unfamiliar great emperor.</p><p>A huge blade appeared in his hand. With a slash, the entire cave was cut in half.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the bottom of the cave, an excited roar was heard, and the iron chains clanked against each other.</p><p>“Quick, help me cut off the chains!”</p><p>An excited voice came from the depths of the cave.</p><p>The man in the air once again slashed out with his giant blade.</p><p>A few saber gleams slashed down, and the sound of iron chains breaking could be heard.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, a loud roar sounded, and the earth cracked. An extremely huge lizard crawled out from the depths of the earth. It was like a beast that had come from the prehistoric times, and it was terrifying.</p><p>This giant lizard was actually a great emperor-level existence.</p><p>“Let’s go to the other worlds and save the others!”</p><p>The man in the air opened his mouth and the space cracked open. He and the giant lizard stepped into the space and arrived in another world.</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family was in one of the most ancient ruins in this world.</p><p>“A powerful being is sealed within!”</p><p>Emperor Heng’s face was gloomy.</p><p>Suddenly, the space split open and the giant lizard and the great emperor expert arrived.</p><p>A great battle immediately erupted.

This was definitely a terrifying force.</p><p>return to the eight worlds, move the worlds, open the void passage, and welcome our tribe!</p><p>A voice rang out. It turned out that the experts who were sealed had returned to their original worlds.</p><p>On the temporal Island in the myriad sea realm, Emperor formless was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>&Nbsp; suddenly, the middle-aged man retreated back to where the divine time Island had been. A shocking ripple exploded out as a pillar of light shot into the sky and spread in all directions.</p><p>At this moment, the entire ten thousand sea realm was shaking.</p><p>In the Ming Yan country of the vast sea region, ruan tianjiao stood in the sky above the Imperial Palace. He looked up at the sky with a serious expression and said in a low voice,” “The heavens and earth are shaking, and the roars are endless. What’s going on with this world? Is it related to outsiders?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened to you?”</p><p>It wasn’t just ruan tianjiao. Everyone in the ten thousand sea realm, as well as other worlds, looked up at the sky. Their faces were pale and they felt fear.</p><p>They felt as if a great disaster was about to befall them.</p><p>In the Ninth World, Lu Ming controlled the celestial Thearch’s sword and fought against the celestial Thearch’s physical body controlled by the eternal Star River. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Suddenly, terrifying roars came from beyond the heavens. They came one after another with astonishing power.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically, not knowing what had happened.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the celestial Thearch’s sword is mine. Hand it over!”</p><p>The eternal Star River roared and the celestial Thearch’s physical body rushed toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>In his eyes, the celestial Emperor’s physical body and the celestial Emperor’s sword were both his. Lu Ming was not qualified to control them at all.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the celestial Emperor’s sword and fought with the other party. After more than ten moves, they were still in a stalemate.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, heaven and earth rumbled and the entire sky started to shake.</p><p>It was as if the entire world was being moved.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the celestial Emperor’s sword and the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body trembled uncontrollably, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>The next moment, a figure flew out of the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body. It was the star River.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The Galaxy roared.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s sword above Lu Ming’s head trembled and flew out. It was held by the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>“What should have happened has happened, but 1 can’t just ignore it!”</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body actually opened its mouth to speak. After saying that, it took a step forward and its huge figure suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“No, my Celestial Emperor corporeal body…”</p><p>The Galaxy roared, extremely unwilling.</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had suddenly left him, and he found it hard to accept.</p><p>With the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, he could instantly become a peak expert in the world and become an Overlord.</p><p>martial artists rely on themselves. Only when they’re strong can they be the strongest. It’s ridiculous that they only think about external things!</p><p>Lu Ming remained calm.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword had flown away, so it was gone. The path to the peak could not be sustained by a single sword. Only by improving oneself could one have the power that would forever belong to one.</p><p>“Lu Ming, damn it…”</p><p>Xing Chen shouted coldly. He was blaming everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not stopped him and he had left with the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body earlier, this might not have happened..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
