He also used the power of his small world to suppress the space passage and stop the invaders.</p><p>The last remaining soul was resurrected and rose to a higher level.</p><p>If this was written into a book, it would be a legend.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had his doubts. Since the celestial Thearch was not dead, where was he now? why did he only leave behind a trace of his mark and not appear in the previous battle?</p><p>The figure of the celestial Thearch seemed to have noticed Lu Ming’s confusion and explained, the primordial realm hasn’t reached the time for a real war yet. The war in the heaven realm has already reached a critical juncture!</p><p>there are nine heaven domains in the heaven realm, but the other eight heaven domains don’t have a passage to the primordial realm. Only the last heaven domain, the Tai Qing heaven domain, has a passage to the primordial realm.</p><p>now, the remaining strong cultivators of the heaven realm are guarding the taiqing heaven region. The evil god tribe has always wanted to occupy the taiqing heaven region and then invade the primordial realm using the passageway there. I’m now fighting in the heaven realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded. He had learned many secrets today.</p><p>my body is made of stone. It’s like a puppet now. I’ll give it to you. I hope it can help you!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor’s figure continued.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body had endless power. He had seen it before. It could even kill great sovereigns. If he could control it, he would immediately become an unparalleled expert. He could destroy the Golden Crow race and the WAN family.</p><p>“Don’t get too excited just yet. If you want to control this stone body, you’ll need energy. I’ve used up all of that energy in the battle with the outsiders, and now, the mark is about to disappear!”</p><p>therefore, in order to control this stone body, I have to let the stone body absorb energy continuously. The more energy it absorbs, the more powerful it will be!</p><p>this stone body is like a puppet. Without a trace of energy, it can’t be controlled and can’t exert much power!</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s words were like a bucket of cold water poured on Lu Ming’s head. It seemed that he had been happy for nothing.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was immediately excited. This was the celestial Thearch’s body. If it absorbed enough energy, it would be able to unleash terrifying power.</p><p>1’11 now teach you how to control this stone body and how to absorb energy!</p><p>The celestial Thearch walked past and pointed a finger between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Some information immediately appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Alright, this mark of mine has completed its mission. It’s time to dissipate. Little guy, 1 look forward to the day you grow up!”</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body smiled.</p><p>“Senior…”</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little sad.</p><p>haha, no need to feel sad for me. I’m not dead. Everything that happened here can be sensed by my main body in the heavenly realm. 1 hope we can meet in the heavenly realm and fight side by side!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s Mark smiled and then disappeared like a wisp of green smoke.</p><p>“Senior, I believe that it won’t be long before we meet again!”</p><p>There was a look of determination in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then sat cross-legged and carefully studied the method of controlling the stone body and the method of absorbing energy that the celestial Thearch had taught him.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had fully comprehended it.</p><p>He circulated his cultivation technique and sensed carefully. He discovered that whether it was Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body or Celestial Emperor’s sword, they were like the bottom of a dried Lake. There was no energy at all and he could not control them.</p><p>“Let’s try to absorb the rough stone!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and took out one hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones. He activated them according to the method taught by the celestial Thearch.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword flew to the back of the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body and the two fused together as if they were one.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>One hundred thousand raw gemstones exploded instantly, turning into rolling energy that was absorbed by Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body and Celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>A moment later, the energy of the one hundred thousand raw gemstones was completely absorbed. Lu Ming quickly sensed it and his face immediately turned bitter.</p><p>He realized that not even one percent of the energy in the one hundred thousand raw gemstones had been filled.</p><p>Not even one-thousandth of its energy was fully replenished.</p><p>How much energy would he need to replenish it?</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. In the end, he gritted his teeth and took out a million high-grade raw gemstones. He let his heaven, earth, and physical body absorb them. What made Lu Ming cry in grief was that the energy of a million high-grade raw gemstones was still not even one percent of the energy.</p><p>sigh, I’d better absorb the energy slowly. I can’t eat hot tofu if I’m impatient!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He kept the celestial Thearch’s body into the mountain and river diagram, allowing it to absorb the energy between heaven and earth on its own.</p><p>Right now, Lu Ming felt that he was especially in need of resources.</p><p>Qiu Yue needed to refine Saint herbs frequently, while Celestial Emperor’s body needed a huge amount of energy.</p><p>Fortunately, the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body could absorb any kind of energy, not just from raw gemstones.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and cultivated quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a sense of urgency after hearing the celestial Thearch’s words.</p><p>The heaven realm seemed to be completely outmatched and could only defend the last heaven domain, tai Qing heaven, to stop the alien races.</p><p>If the alien races broke into the taiqing heavenly region, they could use the void passage and a large Army to rush into the primordial realm.</p><p>The passageway in the heavenly Emperor City was only a small one.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed.</p><p>These days, more and more alien races came to attack ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>The pressure on Gu Yue Holy Land’s forces was getting bigger and bigger.</p><p>Finally, in order to boost morale, many sects joined forces, gathered resources, and created a merit point.</p><p>As long as they killed the alien races, they would be able to get merit points.</p><p>Killing a martial Royal realm alien would earn him one merit point, a lower tier bright Saint alien would earn him five merit points, and a higher tier bright Saint alien would earn him ten merit points …</p><p>And so on, as one’s cultivation level increased, the merit points would double.</p><p>These merit points could be used to exchange for various treasures, such as Saint herbs, Saint weapons, monarch weapons, orirocks, and so on.</p><p>This way, the killing intent of the ancient Moon Holy Land rose. All the powerful forces, as well as the Emperor level forces from the outside world, all went out to hunt the alien races.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to bring everyone out to hunt the alien races. Firstly, they could train themselves in a life-and-death battle, stimulate their potential, and improve their cultivation.</p><p>Secondly, it could be exchanged for resources, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Palace Master, you guys can go. Take this jade talisman. If you encounter a Martial Emperor, you can crush it and the Jade talisman will bring you back to the Dayan elixir Palace!</p><p>Uncle Kong handed Lu Ming a jade talisman.</p><p>Lu Ming accepted it happily. In this way, he would have fewer concerns. If he encountered the other party’s Emperor-level experts, he could escape.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming brought along Huang Li and the other nine elites of the desolate race, as well as Luo Xiang and Lu Xiangxiang. As Ouyang Moli’s cultivation level was still low, he was not invited.</p><p>They flew towards the West of the ancient Moon sanctuary and met up with Feng Ling, Long Chen, Luo Tianyi, and the others at the foot of a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is the base that the ancient Moon Holy Land’s many forces built together!</p><p>Huang Ling smiled and led Lu Ming and the rest towards the mountain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
