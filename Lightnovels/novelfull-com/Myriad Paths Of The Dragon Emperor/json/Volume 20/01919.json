Their spiritual senses covered every corner. It was impossible for him to leave the he family openly without alerting the people of the he family.</p><p>On this day, Ice Dragon Valley master arrived at another mansion.</p><p>“This is … He Qian’s mansion!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” what? ” Ice Dragon Valley master was stunned and subconsciously retracted his aura.</p><p>Then, he saw a middle-aged man walking through he Qian’s door with two young women.</p><p>“Tell me, why do you think elder he Qian would often call for people to send young women in? And you even taught them how to cultivate?”</p><p>There were two middle-aged men guarding the door. One of them said softly.</p><p>Hearing this, Ice Dragon Valley master’s heart moved. He restrained his aura to the extreme and circulated his Saint energy to his ears so that he could hear more clearly.</p><p>I’ve heard some rumors. I’ll tell you, but you can’t spread it!</p><p>The other guard said in a low voice.</p><p>“What news?” The person from before revealed a curious expression.</p><p>1 heard that these women are elder he Qian’s cultivation vessels. After elder he Qian transferred the improved Four Seasons cultivation method to these women, he Qian would visit them and devour their primordial Yin to improve his cultivation base!</p><p>1 heard that elder he Qian’s tribulation is coming, but he’s not confident that he can survive it. That’s why he’s using this method to raise his cultivation base so that he can resist the Tribulation that happens once every three hundred thousand years!</p><p>The person behind explained in a low voice.</p><p>&Nbsp; hearing this, Ice Dragon Valley master’s heart trembled, and he felt cold sweat seep out of his back.</p><p>He finally knew why he Qian had always wanted to take Xiangxiang as his disciple and wanted to pass on the Xiangxiang Four Seasons technique.</p><p>Taking in a disciple was a lie. His real purpose was to let Xiangxiang cultivate he Xiao’s Four Seasons technique.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella was a living being. If she had cultivated the Four Seasons technique that He Yan had given her, and her primordial Yin was devoured by He Yan, it would definitely be of great help to him.</p><p>This was he Qian’s true purpose.</p><p>&Nbsp; the valley master was terrified. Luckily, he felt that something was wrong and didn’t let Xiangxiang cultivate the Four Seasons technique. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>“He Qian, you old fogey, you’re simply devoid of conscience!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master gritted his teeth in worry.</p><p>He had to find a way to escape. It was too dangerous to continue like this.</p><p>If Xiangxiang didn’t cultivate the Four Seasons technique, who knew if he Yan would use other shameless methods to force Xiangxiang.</p><p>The valley master of Ice Dragon Valley returned to his courtyard, feeling uneasy.</p><p>“Grandpa Valley master, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella saw that the Ice Dragon Valley master was uneasy and asked in surprise.</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m fine!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master shook his head.</p><p>He couldn’t tell Xiangxiang about this. If he told Xiangxiang, she would be angry and ask he Qian about it. He was afraid that he Qian would immediately turn hostile.</p><p>He had to keep this matter to himself and plan in secret.</p><p>Xiangxiang, you must not cultivate the Four Seasons technique!</p><p>The valley master of Ice Dragon Valley reminded her again. Seeing Xiangxiang Bella obediently nod her head, the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley finally relaxed.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>Xiangxiang, two days later, there will be a Grand Auction in heavenly Emperor City. Let me bring you there to take a look!</p><p>He Yan found Xiang Xiang and showed a kind smile.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella cheered. During this period of time, she had been cooped up in the he family’s residence to cultivate and had long wanted to go out for a walk.</p><p>“I’ll bring Xiangxiang out for a walk!”</p><p>He Qian said to Ice Dragon Valley master and Tian Chui before walking out with Xiangxiang.</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master revealed a worried expression, but he was helpless.</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Institute, Lu Ming also planned to go out.</p><p>During this period, he had helped some people refine their spirit bodies and used up a large amount of Saint herbs. Even the Saint herbs that Huang Ling and the others brought were running out, so he planned to go out and buy some.</p><p>Over the past year, the Heng family had sent experts to guard the surroundings of the yuan mountain sacred Institute. As soon as Lu Ming went out, they would attack him.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of this.</p><p>He had the divine breath technique, which could change his appearance and aura. With his current cultivation base, even a martial sovereign would not be able to recognize him if he stood in front of him.</p><p>He didn’t go out before because he didn’t want to. If he wanted to, he could go out at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance changed. He turned into a young man with a fair complexion. At the same time, he changed into a long white robe and held a folding fan. He instantly turned into an elegant young master.</p><p>Even his aura was different from before.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped on the air, flying towards the gate of the yuan mountain sacred Institute. Then, he swaggered out of the gate.</p><p>Two martial Supremes from the Heng family had been standing guard in the clouds outside the yuan mountain sacred Institute. When they saw Lu Ming coming out, they scanned him with their spiritual senses. They did not find anything unusual, so they did not bother about him.</p><p>The yuan mountain sacred Academy gathered all the geniuses from all over the yuan mountain. There were young people entering and leaving every day.</p><p>“As expected, ordinary martial sovereigns can’t tell!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and swaggered out of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>He arrived at a bustling place. Not long after he arrived, he heard that there would be a Grand Auction in the heavenly Emperor City today. At that time, there would be many rare and precious treasures being auctioned. Even Martial Emperor powerhouses would attend.</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued and he walked towards the auction house.</p><p>After paying a certain fee, he walked into the auction house.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the auction house, they were greeted by an extremely spacious hall. In the hall, countless figures had gathered. A rough estimate put there at least hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>Around the hall were rooms for distinguished guests. Of course, they were prepared for powerful people or people with prominent identities.</p><p>Most of the people could only stay in the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly found a seat in the hall and sat down.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people increased.</p><p>An hour later, the auction began.</p><p>The first auction item made Lu Ming’s eyes widen.</p><p>That was because it was a monarch weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. This Grand Auction of the heavenly Emperor City was indeed extraordinary. The first item to be auctioned was actually a sovereign weapon.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was envious, the sovereign weapon’s price was shocking. Moreover, a group of people were fighting for it. The price had risen to a terrifying level. Lu Ming could only look on and sigh. In the end, the sovereign weapon was bought by someone in the VIP room at a terrifyingly high price. It was probably a Martial Emperor.</p><p>The auction continued, and the second item was far less valuable than the monarch weapon.</p><p>This was only natural. There would be at least a few hundred treasures in an auction. It was impossible for every single one of them to be as valuable as a monarch weapon.</p><p>But even so, the second item was a rare treasure.</p><p>The bidding was intense, and one treasure after another was won.</p><p>Lu Ming was envious of many of the treasures. Unfortunately, the prices were too high and he had to give up. He had bid for a few good sacred elixirs..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
