Their voices came from afar,” “You guys, just you wait!”</p><p>“Hehe, a few clowns!”</p><p>Desolate li grinned and returned to his meal.</p><p>After three rounds of drinking, the banquet finally ended.</p><p>Those who joined the Dragon Alliance all lived within the area covered by the array disc.</p><p>The formation of the Dragon Alliance and the appearance of the third formation plate made the atmosphere in the yuan mountain sacred Academy even more tense.</p><p>This was because three out of the four sets of formation disks had already appeared. There was still one more set left.</p><p>The competition in the remaining small alliances became even more intense. There were fights every day on the absolute Saint battlefield.</p><p>After more than ten days of competition, the fourth set of formation disks was finally obtained by an Alliance, the Knight’s Association.</p><p>The leader of this Alliance was the third-ranked genius on the Saint King ranking. He was very powerful.</p><p>With that, all four sets of formation disks were obtained, forming four alliances.</p><p>The remaining small groups and alliances all joined the four alliances to seek protection.</p><p>Because without the protection of the array disc, they would be in danger in the yuan mountain sacred Academy and could be attacked at any time.</p><p>There were very few people who didn’t join the four alliances. There were only a few powerful lone wolves, such as the son of death, death blade. He was a lone wolf.</p><p>However, none of the forces dared to offend him.</p><p>No matter which cultivation place he went to, no force would dare to stop him.</p><p>He was too powerful. Now, no one could say that they could defeat the death blade, except for the Heng Xing River.</p><p>However, this also proved that the death blade had nothing to do with the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>However, the number of people who joined the heaven Emperor Alliance was still the most. The heaven Emperor Alliance was undoubtedly the most powerful.</p><p>Some people ranked the four alliances based on their strength.</p><p>Heaven Emperor Alliance, number one!</p><p>The Dragon League was second!</p><p>The divine fire Alliance and the Knight’s Association were in third and fourth place respectively.</p><p>In the following period of time, the yuan mountain sacred Academy became even more chaotic. The four alliances started to fight for the cultivation grounds, killing each other continuously.</p><p>It was only after a few months that the killing finally stopped.</p><p>The four alliances each occupied a cultivation ground, and Mount Yuan entered a period of peace.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the four alliances each took a spot and started to cultivate.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming would also choose some reliable people and use the Dayan elixir furnace to help them temper their spirit bodies and upgrade their spirit bodies ‘levels.</p><p>For example, with the help of the DAyan elixir furnace, the four elites of the desolate race with medium grade heavenly spiritual bodies had all evolved their spiritual bodies to become high grade heavenly spiritual bodies, greatly increasing their strength.</p><p>And Xue ningxin, with the help of the Dayan elixir furnace, had also reached the upper-class heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>Xue ningxin was a true dragon and had enough talent. With the help of the Dayan elixir furnace, her spirit body improved rapidly.</p><p>The strength of the entire Dragon Alliance was constantly improving.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a year had passed.</p><p>It had been a year and a half since the great emperor had announced the new rules.</p><p>During this period of time, although Lu Ming often helped others to temper their spirit bodies, he did not neglect his own cultivation. The place where he stayed the most was the absolute Saint battlefield. There, he fought with powerful ferocious beasts and used the battle to stimulate his own potential.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base had also successfully broken through and entered the mastery absolute Saint realm.</p><p>The other King bodies, such as Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, Huang Li, and Long Chen, had also broken through and entered the upper tier of the absolute Saint realm. Luo Tianyi had even reached the pinnacle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the harder it would be to break through. It was already very fast to be able to break through one level in just over a year. This was also because of the good cultivation conditions in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>If he were to cultivate normally, he would definitely not be able to achieve such a speed.</p><p>As for the divine ability art, ever since Lu Ming’s divine ability art had reached 90% mastery, the speed of improvement had become even slower.</p><p>After a year and a half, Lu Ming’s divine power Technique had only improved to ninety-three percent. Every step forward was extremely difficult.</p><p>The closer one got to the perfect 100%, the more difficult it was.</p><p>The Galaxy had reached the absolute Saint perfection a year and a half ago. However, it would not be easy for him to cross this step and enter the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Heaven Emperor City was the leader of the nine sacred lands of Yuan mountain. Its overall strength was much, much stronger than the ancient Moon sacred land.</p><p>In the heavenly Emperor City, there were a few of the biggest ancient aristocratic families that had been passed down for countless years. They were powerful and had a deep foundation.</p><p>The Heng family was one of them, and they were known as the descendants of the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The he clan was one of them. They were as powerful as the Heng clan and had a feud with the Heng clan. A thousand years ago, the two clans had a terrible war that resulted in countless deaths and injuries. It was only in the recent hundreds of years that the situation had stabilized.</p><p>The mansion of the he family was extremely vast and boundless.</p><p>In the he family’s mansion, there were not only endless palaces, pavilions, and towers, but also mountain peaks that reached into the clouds and a winding river. It was like a country.</p><p>Several figures were standing on a mountain peak of the he family.</p><p>One of them was a white-haired old man with a kind expression. Beside the old man was a burly young man.</p><p>These two people were actually the Ice Dragon Valley master and Tian Chui.</p><p>Not far from the two of them, there was an old man.</p><p>The old man was wearing a brocade robe embroidered with the different scenery of the Four Seasons.</p><p>However, he was very old, much older than Ice Dragon Valley master. His face was full of wrinkles, and his hair was almost all gone.</p><p>However, from the flash of a terrifying light in his eyes, one could tell that this person must be a very terrifying master.</p><p>However, all three of them were looking at a young girl who was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the mountain.</p><p>This young lady was Lu Ming’s first true disciple, Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Xiangxiang’s body emitted a mysterious light. The mountain was filled with endless vitality. Countless flowers and trees grew wildly. Small trees turned into towering ancient trees. Even some ordinary grass turned into spiritual grass.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a moment, the aura on Lu Xiangxiang’s body suddenly soared.</p><p>“I’ve broken through!”</p><p>&Nbsp; on the side, the eyes of the withered elder, Ice Dragon Valley master, and Tian Chui lit up in shock.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang had broken through to the peak of the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>Especially the valley master and Tian Chui, they were truly shocked.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella’s cultivation had been at the Martial Emperor realm when they had escaped from the Azure continent. Now, after a few years, her cultivation had reached the astonishing peak of the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>Xiangxiang, she’s not even fifteen years old.</p><p>A few hours later, the aura on Lu Xiangxiang’s body receded. She opened her eyes and stood up.</p><p>A few years had passed, and Xiangxiang was already a slim and beautiful young lady. She was tall and beautiful, and she already had the potential to cause the downfall of cities and countries.</p><p>“Hahaha, not bad, Xiangxiang. I didn’t expect you to break through so quickly and reach the peak of the great saint realm. Such an achievement is rare even in the entire Yuan mountain!”</p><p>The skinny old man walked over and smiled.</p><p>“Thank you for the praise, senior he Qian!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella bowed to the skinny old man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
