Instead, he was defeated by another young man in a direct confrontation.</p><p>The number one genius of Mount Yuan in the Heng Xing River, the undefeated legend, was shattered today.</p><p>Of course, another legend was born.</p><p>If news of today’s matter spread out, the entire Yuan mountain would be shaken.</p><p>Especially the Heng family. It was as if their faith had collapsed and they were terrified.</p><p>The Heng Xing River was the representative and pride of the Heng family. Ever since they started cultivating in the Heng Xing River, they had never lost to anyone of the same generation.</p><p>But today, he was defeated!</p><p>On the other hand, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the Emperor-to-be on their side were ecstatic.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated the stellar River. The situation could be completely reversed.</p><p>Hmph, he merely borrowed some secret skill. Who knows if Lu Ming will become a good-for-nothing or his strength will be greatly reduced once this secret skill is used? what’s the use of a temporary victory? ”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said unhappily, and his voice resounded throughout the whole place.</p><p>Of course, he was getting further and further away from Lu Ming and was prepared to escape at any time.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s words made many people’s eyes flash.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming’s state clearly showed that he had used some kind of terrifying secret skill.</p><p>Such a secret technique had actually increased Lu Ming’s abilities so much. The aftereffects were definitely shocking. He would become a good-for-nothing immediately. It might be a little exaggerated, but if his source was damaged and it affected his future cultivation, Lu Ming would no longer be a match for the Galaxy.</p><p>Some of the people who had a grudge against Lu Ming prayed in their hearts and hoped that this was the case.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could not be bothered with the voices of the outside world. He continued to rush towards the Galaxy.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s killing intent was like a tidal wave. Who cared if he was the eternal Son? he would kill him first.</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression was ugly, but he did not dare to clash head-on with Lu Ming. He turned into a rainbow light and rushed toward the blood-red Bridge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely behind and rushed toward the blood-red Bridge.</p><p>“Could it be that the giant bridge has already reached the other side of the abyss?”</p><p>the stellar River definitely knows something. Now that he’s charging towards the giant bridge, he must have reached the other side and entered the Ninth World. Let’s charge too!</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The others also rushed toward the bridge, including the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family, the Daluo heaven sect, and the Golden Crow Tribe.</p><p>The originally intense chaotic battle had also stopped at this moment.</p><p>The Black Mass of people all rushed onto the giant bridge and ran forward.</p><p>“We’re going too!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others led a group of experts and rushed toward the giant bridge.</p><p>After they crossed the giant bridge, the Dayan elixir furnace shrank rapidly and flew toward Lu Ming. It flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows and disappeared.</p><p>This giant bridge was extremely long and wide, and it led straight into the depths.</p><p>The Galaxy was running at the forefront at an astonishing speed. However, Lu Ming was still closing the distance between him and the Galaxy.</p><p>Not long after, they saw the giant bridge pass through a thick fog.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Could it be that the Ninth World was behind the fog?</p><p>The 9th World couldn’t be entered directly from the outside. It was said to be the world where undyings lived, what exactly was there?</p><p>The Galaxy was the first to rush into the fog. Lu Ming followed closely behind.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed into the fog, he realized that he had arrived in a void.</p><p>Yes, the void!</p><p>There was no land here. It was like the starry sky in the universe. He was floating in the void.</p><p>The star River was not far away, but he seemed to be stunned as he looked ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look over. At first glance, his heart trembled violently and he was stunned.</p><p>A figure was sitting cross-legged in the void in front of him.</p><p>But that figure was too big and too majestic.</p><p>This person’s body was even taller than any mountain. Just by sitting there, he was like a planet in the vast universe.</p><p>In front of it, humans were as small as dust.</p><p>But the most important thing was that this was a Golem.</p><p>It was like a huge stone statue, but it was very lifelike.</p><p>This was a young man who looked to be in his thirties. His eyes were closed as he sat cross-legged in the void, but he gave off a feeling of unparalleled magnificence, unparalleled in the world, and the world.</p><p>What shocked Lu Ming the most was that he had seen the golem’s appearance before.</p><p>Initially, the two great sovereigns had a great battle at the heavenly Emperor mountain. In the end, the blood of the great sovereigns fell and the heavenly Emperor mountain had a strange change.</p><p>At that time, a figure had condensed at the heavenly Emperor mountain. Around thirty years old, with unparalleled magnificence, he seemed to be the figure of the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>This stone man in front of him looked exactly the same as the figure that had appeared at the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>Could this be the statue of the celestial Emperor?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, there were people passing through the fog and appearing in the void.</p><p>But when they saw the giant golems, they were all stunned and shocked.</p><p>“Celestial Emperor, this is the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>“A Celestial Emperor statue?”</p><p>no, it’s the corporeal body, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body!</p><p>In the end, an Emperor-to-be from the Heng family couldn’t hold back his shock and shouted. Everyone’s heart was in shock.</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body?</p><p>This was the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body!</p><p>Legend had it that the celestial Emperor had fallen in the distant past. Could this really be the body left behind by the celestial Emperor after his fall?</p><p>It was very possible!</p><p>There were many ancient ruins in the Lotus World, and some places seemed to have suppressed terrifying creatures. If it wasn’t for the celestial Thearch, who could have done it?</p><p>In the distant past, for some unknown reason, the celestial Thearch suppressed some of the more powerful living beings here. However, he himself died and his physical body was left here, sitting in the Ninth World.</p><p>No wonder he couldn’t directly enter the Ninth World.</p><p>No wonder the other worlds would have the legend that the Ninth World was home to undying beings.</p><p>Undying was the celestial Emperor!</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he thought of more things. He thought of the celestial Emperor’s sword, which was also a stone sword.</p><p>The sword was made of stone, and this huge body was also made of stone. What was the connection between these two? could it really be the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body?</p><p>Could it be that the celestial Thearch wasn’t a human, but a strange life form?</p><p>At this moment, countless people’s eyes were burning with fire.</p><p>That was the fire of greed!</p><p>If this giant Golem was really the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, then its value would be unimaginable.</p><p>That was the celestial Thearch!</p><p>Now, the heavenly Emperor was a legend, and the great emperor was the peak expert.</p><p>A great emperor could almost dominate an area, be invincible, and control the great Dao.</p><p>As for the celestial Thearch, he was even more unimaginable.</p><p>Legend had it that the celestial Thearch was almost the same as the heavenly Dao. Moreover, he did not suffer any major tribulations and was truly immortal.</p><p>When one became a Celestial Emperor, there would be no more tribulations of heaven and earth, and they would truly live as long as heaven and earth.</p><p>Such a person was unimaginably strong.</p><p>One could only imagine the value of the body left behind by such a person.</p><p>No matter if it was true or false, they couldn’t miss it and would make people go crazy.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the next moment, many figures rushed towards the giant Golem, their eyes shining with greed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
