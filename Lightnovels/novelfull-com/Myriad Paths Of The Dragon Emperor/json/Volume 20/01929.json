Even more than ten martial emperors and even true emperors had fallen.</p><p>In the heavenly Emperor City, the atmosphere was extremely oppressive.</p><p>This was because everyone knew that the war between the two clans would not end just like that. On the contrary, it was only the beginning.</p><p>Sure enough, after this battle, the two families were at war.</p><p>Both sides sent people to attack each other’s businesses.</p><p>Both sides were constantly fighting and experts were constantly being killed.</p><p>The enmity between the two sides had reached an irreconcilable point.

He would use the blood of the Heng and he families to pay tribute to the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>It would be even more perfect if a great emperor died.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>A battle between great sovereigns was a rare sight. This incident had alarmed most of the powerful forces in the yuan mountain. In the past half a month, many experts had come to the heavenly Emperor City, wanting to see the great sovereigns.</p><p>Time flew by, and half a month passed in a flash.</p><p>On this day, countless people gathered at the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>Normally, when great emperors fought, no one would dare to get close to watch.</p><p>Great sovereigns were too powerful. Even a wisp of their Qi would be disastrous. They would definitely die. Even ordinary martial sovereigns would not be able to survive.</p><p>However, it would be different at the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>Legend had it that the heavenly Emperor mountain was the place where the heavenly Emperor had cultivated and verified his Dao. On it, the heavenly Emperor’s Qi engine filled the air. Ordinary people would not be able to climb up the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>Even for Martial Emperor powerhouses, their cultivation would be greatly suppressed when they ascended the heavenly Emperor mountain. It was said that even true Emperor powerhouses could not fly when they entered the heavenly Emperor mountain’s range.</p><p>Only the great emperor powerhouses could fly when they entered the heavenly Emperor mountain. However, they would be greatly suppressed. The fluctuations from the battle would also be suppressed and would not cause any disastrous consequences.</p><p>On this morning, the sky surrounding the heavenly Emperor mountain was filled with countless figures.</p><p>There were countless people of all cultivation levels.</p><p>There were martial Royal realm, Saint realm, Martial Emperor realm, and even true Emperor realm experts.</p><p>A battle between great emperors was a rare sight. It might be of help to a true Emperor.</p><p>Under the lead of a few true Emperor level teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy also came to the void far away from the heavenly Emperor mountain. They looked on from afar. Lu Ming and the others were among them.</p><p>Si la! Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the void not far away from the heavenly Emperor mountain suddenly cracked. From two openings, a figure stepped out.</p><p>Two figures were completely shrouded in endless light. Their faces could not be seen clearly, but they had a strong and boundless aura that spread in all directions.</p><p>Although they were very far away, at this moment, countless people felt as if a divine mountain was pressing down on their bodies. This kind of pressure was like facing the heavenly Dao, and they were unable to resist.</p><p>Two great emperors!</p><p>The great emperors of the he and Heng clans had arrived.</p><p>The two great emperors looked at each other from a distance and exploded with an even more shocking aura.</p><p>“This time, 1’11 kill you!”</p><p>A voice was heard. This voice was cold and full of arrogance, like a god looking down on all living beings.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard this voice before. It was the great emperor of the Heng family. Back then, it had sounded at the yuan mountain sacred Academy and he had even fought with Emperor notionless.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The other figure was clearly the great emperor of the he family. His voice was deep and filled with endless dominance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Next, the two figures moved at the same time and flew towards the top of the heavenly Emperor mountain. In the beginning, their speed was so astonishing that many people could not see them clearly.</p><p>However, as soon as the two of them entered the heavenly Emperor mountain, they seemed to have felt a terrifying pressure. Their speed had drastically slowed down. The closer they got to the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain, the slower their speed became.</p><p>In the end, the light on the two figures disappeared, and their bodies were revealed to everyone.</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family was an old man with gloomy eyes.</p><p>The great emperor of the he family, on the other hand, looked like a middle-aged brawny man with a burly figure and unparalleled dominance.</p><p>Of course, one couldn’t judge a person’s age by their appearance. The two great emperors of the Heng and he families had lived for countless years.</p><p>Both of them landed on the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain and faced each other. Then, both of them suddenly rushed to each other and struck out their palms at the same time.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a muffled boom, the entire heavenly Emperor mountain seemed to be shaking.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, even though they were very far away, they could feel the intense fluctuations in the space.</p><p>“So terrifying. Is this the strength of a great emperor? This is the heavenly Emperor mountain, yet it can cause such a shocking shock!”</p><p>an ordinary void Emperor at the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain could barely contend with them. They could not fight with them at all. Indeed, the strength of the great emperor realm is not a small matter!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>After the exchange of blows, the great emperors from the Heng clan and the he clan both retreated slightly before launching another attack at each other.</p><p>The two of them clashed again, creating a shocking shockwave.</p><p>If this was outside, the world would probably be turned upside down.</p><p>After that, the two of them continued to fight, but it was very normal. It was like two low-level martial artists fighting, one move after another, and the speed was not particularly fast.</p><p>This made many people look at each other. Were great emperors always so ordinary?</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest were also at a loss. They could not see what was so brilliant about it.</p><p>However, the few true Emperor teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Academy all had a serious expression on their faces as they stared intently..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
