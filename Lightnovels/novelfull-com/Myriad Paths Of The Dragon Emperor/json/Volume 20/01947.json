His attitude was so respectful that it was shocking.</p><p>Blue water Country was ranked first in the vast sea nine nations, and was also the most powerful person in the vast sea nine nations. Who could make him lower his stance so low?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the two old men, but the two old men’s faces were very ugly.</p><p>A faint smile hung on Lu Ming’s face. He looked at the two elders and said,”Are you sure you want to make a move?”</p><p>The two elders forced a smile and stood up to cup their fists at Lu Ming. One of them said,” young master Lu, you must be joking. We wouldn’t dare to fight you!</p><p>That’s right, these two elders were also outsiders. When they first entered, they appeared on the same Island as Lu Ming. They had seen Lu Ming kill the Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow clan with their own eyes.</p><p>They were only at the perfected absolute Saint realm. How would they dare to fight Lu Ming? they were just courting death.</p><p>The two old men’s attitude made the blue water Country ruler’s body freeze as he looked at the two old men in disbelief.</p><p>These two old men had appeared in blue water Country some time ago, and the strength they had displayed was simply world-shaking and unfathomable. He was shocked and regarded them as Supreme powers.</p><p>However, such a person was trembling in fear in front of Lu Ming. How was this possible? Who was that young man?</p><p>Blue water Country ruler’s heart continued to sink.</p><p>“You guys also want to go to the time God mountain, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued and the two elders nodded.</p><p>very good. Now, all of you attack and kill them. I’ll give you two spots!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, pointing at the blue water Country ruler and the group of experts.</p><p>Blue water Country ruler’s expression changed as he shouted,” “Senior, don’t!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two old men looked at each other, then burst out and attacked the blue water King and the others.</p><p>In the face of an absolute Saint in the great circle, the blue water Country ruler and the other experts could not resist at all and were killed immediately. Even the great saints were the same. They had no power to resist.</p><p>In an instant, the blue water Country ruler and all the experts were killed. The ones with weaker cultivation were left trembling, their faces pale.</p><p>So strong!</p><p>At the scene, the people from the other countries looked at the two old men in shock.</p><p>The cultivation of the two elders was unfathomable. There were many great saints in blue water Country, but they were all killed by the two elders in an instant.</p><p>However, such an expert was very respectful in front of Lu Ming and addressed him as young master Lu.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled, and they began to sweat.</p><p>In particular, the other seven nations were secretly glad that they did not offend Lu Ming just now. Otherwise, they would be in deep trouble.</p><p>At this moment, the monarch of the fallen nations was trembling all over and his face was pale. He was afraid that Lu Ming would lull him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao and the people from Ming Yan country were also shocked.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s identity? even two powerful elders were so respectful to him. Lu Ming was becoming more and more mysterious in their eyes.</p><p>“I just said that the mingyan country will be the leader of the nine countries. The divine time island’s quota will be decided by the mingyan country. Do you have any objections?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his gaze sweeping across the entire scene.</p><p>1 have no objections, not at all. Young master Lu is unparalleled and unparalleled in the world. He rules over the nine nations. If anyone has any objections, 1’11 be the first one to kill them!</p><p>The king of Luoshui Kingdom finally seized the opportunity and was the first one to shout and flatter Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people secretly cursed the Luoshui King for being shameless. Previously, he had ridiculed Lu Ming as a fool and wondered if he was crazy. Now, he immediately elevated Lu Ming to the sky.</p><p>no objections. Blue water Country thinks they have some strength and is overbearing. They should have given up the position of Alliance leader long ago!</p><p>that’s right. It’s just right for the mingyan country to be the alliance leader!</p><p>“The spots for the divine time Island will also be decided by the mingyan country!”</p><p>The rulers of the other Seven Kingdoms also began to speak up and flatter him.</p><p>What a joke. Lu Ming was so capable. They did not dare to disagree.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, no matter where one was, there was a rule that followed. The weak were prey to the strong. Only strength was the truth.</p><p>take a blood oath. Otherwise, when 1 leave, who knows if you will attack the mingyan country!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“I don’t dare, I don’t dare!”</p><p>“Whoever dares to attack Ming Yan country, 1’11 fight them to the death!”</p><p>Those country rulers all expressed their position and then took a blood oath to wholeheartedly support the mingyan country as the alliance leader. They would not have any second thoughts.</p><p>At this moment, their lives were more important, so they didn’t dare to have any objections.</p><p>Just like that, ruan tianjiao sat on the throne of the alliance leader of the nine nations.</p><p>During this period of time, she felt like she was in a dream.</p><p>First, he sat on the throne of Ming Yan country, and then he sat on the throne of the Alliance of nine countries. If he had not experienced it himself, how could he believe it?</p><p>“Lu Ming, Who are you?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao muttered. She sighed in her heart. That day, she had relied on her intuition to keep Lu Ming by her side. It was the best decision she had ever made in her life. It was also the most important decision.</p><p>Otherwise, she would have been killed by the state preceptor.</p><p>What happened next was simple.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao sat on the alliance leader’s throne and chose a Prince with a weaker cultivation in blue water Country to help him sit on the throne. This person naturally listened to ruan tianjiao’s orders.</p><p>He then began to select the candidates for the divine time Island.</p><p>After everything was over, they settled down in the blue water nation and waited for the arrival of the emissaries from the time God Island.</p><p>In a huge courtyard, Lu Ming and ruan tianjiao were drinking.</p><p>heavenly flood Dragon, your spiritual body should be a low-grade heavenly spiritual body, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao nodded.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s spiritual body was extremely rare in the vast sea nine nations. Otherwise, he would not have been able to cultivate to the great circle of the bright Saint stage at such a young age and be known as the war goddess of the bright flame country.</p><p>I have a treasure that can allow your spirit body to evolve. However, how much you can gain will depend on you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He planned to use the DA yan pill furnace to help ruan Tian Jiao temper his spirit body.</p><p>Knowing each other was fate. He wanted to help ruan tianjiao increase his strength as much as possible. Otherwise, when he left, ruan tianjiao’s strength would not be enough to intimidate the experts from other countries.</p><p>“It can evolve spirit bodies?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao revealed a shocked expression. There was actually such a treasure in the world.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and waved his hand. The Dayan elixir furnace appeared and fell to the ground.</p><p>the process of tempering with pill fire will be very painful. If you can’t help it, tell me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So what if it’s painful?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao smiled and entered the Dayan elixir furnace. Lu Ming waved his hand and threw in a large amount of sacred medicine, helping ruan tianjiao to temper his spiritual body.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s willpower was very strong. Every time, he persevered to the end.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. Ruan tianjiao’s spiritual body had successfully evolved into a medium grade heaven spiritual body. Due to the evolution of her spiritual body, her cultivation had also broken through to the Supreme Saint realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
