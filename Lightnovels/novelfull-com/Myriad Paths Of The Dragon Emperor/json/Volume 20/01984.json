Let’s listen to the great emperor and return to the yuan mountain sacred Academy first. We will take Xiangxiang and the rest and leave the heavenly Emperor City. I feel that the heavenly Emperor City will not be peaceful in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, below the cave, the rumbles were even more terrifying. The shocking fluctuations even caused the heavenly Emperor City to shake.</p><p>Beams of light shot out from the cave. The battle below became even more intense.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>They didn’t stay any longer. They rose into the air and rushed towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The others did the same. They turned into streaks of light and left.</p><p>As they were flying towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the shaking behind them became more and more intense. A terrifying light rushed out from the cave.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Behind them, they heard the sound of fighting. From a distance, they saw what seemed to be a burly figure riding a strange beast and rushing out of the cave.</p><p>A three-eyed God rushed out and stepped into the primordial realm.</p><p>They didn’t dare to stop and flew at full speed.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor mountain was quite a distance away from the yuan mountain sacred Institute. They arrived at the yuan mountain sacred Institute after ten minutes.</p><p>Currently, no one knew how the battle at the original heavenly Emperor mountain had developed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest returned to their residence after returning to the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>At this moment, there were already many people gathered at the residence.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Xue ningxin, and the others were all there.</p><p>This time, only the strongest cultivators entered the Lotus World. Those below the absolute Saint realm didn’t enter. They all stayed in the yuan mountain Saint Academy, such as Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Master, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang asked.</p><p>Everyone here could feel what was happening at the heavenly Emperor mountain. It was because that kind of vibration was too strong.</p><p>there is an invasion from a foreign race. Now is not the time to talk. Gather everyone and leave heavenly Emperor City first. Quick!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>Some of them should still be in seclusion in some cultivation places. They immediately went their separate ways to gather the other members of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Some people were in their cultivation places and couldn’t be contacted, so they had to ask the teachers of the sacred Institute to help them pass the message.</p><p>Half an hour later, most of the people from the Dragon League had arrived, with the invasion of the foreign tribes, there will probably be a Great war in heaven Emperor City. We have to leave heaven Emperor City. Anyone who wants to go to ancient Moon sanctuary with me can go together. If you are not willing, you can leave together and return to your respective forces!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’d better return to the sect!”</p><p>“Me too, let’s return to the family first!”</p><p>Many people said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head. These geniuses all had their own forces. In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, they were members of the Dragon Alliance. However, after leaving the yuan mountain sacred Academy, they naturally had to return to their respective sects.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not force them. In the yuan mountain sacred Institute, they belonged to the Dragon Alliance. They might be of use in the future.</p><p>“Then let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Immediately, they flew out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>As soon as they arrived outside the yuan mountain sacred Institute, they heard a tide-like battle cry.</p><p>A group of three-eyed gods were riding mutant beasts and fighting against a group of humans. The battle was extremely brutal.</p><p>Then, they looked into the distance and found that all the places in the heavenly Emperor City were in the middle of a war.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the depths of the heavenly Emperor City, in the direction of the heavenly Emperor mountain, the void space trembled. Another group of three-eyed gods rode on strange beasts and charged over.</p><p>The strange beast stepped in the air, and the sky shook violently.</p><p>The three-eyed God race had already charged out.</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed God race was riding on a huge, ferocious beast. He was wearing heavy armor and holding a battle axe. His three eyes were as sharp as swords as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming and the others.”Charge! Kill them!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>This group of three-eyed gods was riding on their beasts and charging toward them.</p><p>the strongest one is an Emperor-to-be! Let’s charge!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took the lead in charging forward.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! the three-eyed God in the lead swung his battle-ax down at Lu Ming. At the same time, a destructive light burst forth from his third eye.</p><p>“Prison suppression!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the nine shadows of the prison-suppressing steles appeared, pressing forward.</p><p>“The prison-guarding stele, it’s the prison-guarding stele!”</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed God race roared in fear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the prison-suppressing stele’s attack and defense were both completely vanquished, and the other three-eyed God race members were also killed.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Ling, Long Chen and the others also attacked and killed a group of three-eyed gods. They broke out of the encirclement and rushed out of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>“Someone has the power of the prison-guarding stele. We can’t let him go!”</p><p>“We must kill him!”</p><p>Roars could be heard from the distance as groups of three-eyed God race experts charged toward them on their beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group increased their speed and rushed outside.</p><p>“It has the power of the prison-suppressing stele. Kill!”</p><p>A loud roar came from the sky. A huge battle-ax was swung down at Lu Ming. The vast Emperor’s throne was terrifying.</p><p>A martial Supreme!</p><p>An Emperor-level expert had made a move on Lu Ming, wanting to kill him.</p><p>However, at this moment, a huge metal rod swept out and collided with the battle axe. A terrifying boom erupted. The terrifying sound waves shook Lu Ming and the others, causing their eardrums to hurt.</p><p>A burly figure with an iron rod in his hand appeared above Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“It’s teacher!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were overjoyed.</p><p>This was a teacher of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>run! We’ll stop their martial Supreme!</p><p>The voice of a teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy rang out. After that, a few more figures appeared, exuding a vast aura.</p><p>They were all teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, and they were all martial Supreme realm experts.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to everyone and they continued to rush out. “Stay!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>A few more powerful three-eyed gods roared and charged toward Lu Ming and the others. They were all martial Supreme powerhouses.</p><p>you’re a great emperor, yet you’re going against a few juniors. You evil race beings are really shameless!</p><p>“We are your opponents!”</p><p>The teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy also made their moves, blocking the other party’s Emperor-level experts.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, they were constantly charging outwards.</p><p>&Nbsp; several groups of three-eyed God race cavalry charged at them, but they were all defeated.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor City had already been completely engulfed in the flames of war. Countless three-eyed gods had rushed out from the vortex, and the sounds of killing could be heard everywhere.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the group passed by the Heng family’s territory, they discovered that the Heng family was also in a war.</p><p>In the sky above the Heng family, there were even true emperors fighting. The scene was shocking.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already kept his third bloodline. Also, he had learned his lesson and did not dare to use the power of the prison-suppressing stele so easily in case he was targeted..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
