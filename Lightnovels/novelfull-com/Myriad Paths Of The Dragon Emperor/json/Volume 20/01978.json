Even if he only managed to knock a piece off his body, it would still be priceless. Even Martial Emperor powerhouses would be envious if he brought it out.</p><p>One figure after another charged forward.</p><p>“Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is mine. Whoever touches it will die!”</p><p>Xing Chen shouted, and his entire body turned into a sword light and slashed out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The sword light slashed down, and blood splattered everywhere. Heads flew off one after another.</p><p>In an instant, more than ten Emperor-to-be were killed by the star River.</p><p>The difference between an ordinary Emperor-to-be and the star River was too great. They could be killed instantly without any resistance. The river of laws was easily cut open and pierced.</p><p>The other emperors-to-be were shocked and flew away. The Galaxy was too overbearing.</p><p>“Star River, our battle is not over yet. Let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. His killing intent surged like a tide. His eyes were blood-red as he stepped toward the star River.</p><p>Within a certain range around him, no one dared to step in except those who were close to Lu Ming.</p><p>When the star River saw Lu Ming coming over, its expression turned ugly. It turned into a ray of light and rushed toward the huge stone man.</p><p>form the formation! Stop him with the monarch weapons!</p><p>The voice of the Galaxy rang out.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng clan started to move. Their figures flickered and formed a magical formation.</p><p>Those who had monarch weapons also took out their weapons.</p><p>Even an Emperor-to-be couldn’t fully exert the power of a sovereign weapon, but when many of them gathered together to form a formation, the power was still terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Beams of sword Qi shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few punches and the void trembled, destroying the sword Qi.</p><p>But then, even more sword Qi came at him.</p><p>In the Heng family, most of the people cultivated the eternal spring laws and paid attention to continuous cultivation.</p><p>Boundless sword Qi blasted toward Lu Ming, blocking his path.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming’s combat strength was, he could not charge out in a short period of time.</p><p>And the stellar River was rapidly approaching the golems.</p><p>His speed was very fast, and the others were a bit behind him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of death light slashed over and blocked a large amount of sword Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming, go after the stellar River. I’ll take care of this for you!</p><p>The death blade came through the air, and the sky of death covered the area, blocking a large area of sword light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red eyes swept over the death blade. Without saying anything, he soared into the sky, turned into a ray of blood-red light, and chased after the stellar River at extreme speed.</p><p>They looked at the golem and it didn’t seem far from them, but when they flew, they knew that they were very far away from it.</p><p>Because that Golem was simply too big.</p><p>In the void, streaks of rainbow light flew towards the giant Golem like meteors.</p><p>The eternal Star River was far ahead. However, Lu Ming was in hot pursuit and was slowly approaching.</p><p>This flight took a full half an hour.</p><p>With their speed, they had flown for half an hour. One could imagine how far this distance was.</p><p>And at this time, they finally neared the enormous Golem.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the Galaxy had already left the rest far behind. They were far ahead. Lu Ming was already approaching the Galaxy.</p><p>“Damn it, what kind of secret technique is this guy using? it still hasn’t disappeared!”</p><p>The Galaxy roared in its heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered in a bloody glow, and his aura was still powerful.</p><p>Normal secret techniques wouldn’t be able to sustain such a powerful attack for so long.</p><p>However, Lu Ming seemed to be fine.</p><p>He burst out with all his strength and rushed towards the giant Golem at extreme speed.</p><p>He had a feeling that the blood in his body was boiling, as if he had developed a sense of closeness with the giant Golem and the common people.</p><p>It was as if this Golem had a bloodline connection with him.</p><p>“It must be the Heng family’s ancestor, it must be!”</p><p>The Galaxy roared in its heart.</p><p>The closer he got to the giant Golem, the stronger the feeling he had. He felt that as long as he flew to the golem, he would be able to get it.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>That was because in his sea of consciousness, the stone sword, the celestial Emperor’s sword, was constantly trembling, buzzing, and whistling.</p><p>It was as if he had formed a connection with the stone man.</p><p>“The stone sword, perhaps it really is the sword of the celestial Emperor, the sword of this stone man!”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind. However, he did not slow down and gradually approached the Galaxy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a terrifying fist radiance blasted toward the star River.</p><p>“The eternal God Bell!”</p><p>Xing Chen shouted and unleashed his full power. Another round of the eternal God clock enveloped him.</p><p>The eternal God Bell trembled and released a terrifying sound wave that rushed towards Lu Ming. However, it was broken by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>As the Galaxy flew toward the stone golems, it shook the eternal God Bell. The terrifying sound waves transformed into all sorts of sharp attacks that charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s moves were very simple. He cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and punched out, destroying the sound waves. He slowly approached the Galaxy.</p><p>The two of them fought as they flew, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A few rays of fist radiance broke through the sound waves of the star River and bombarded the eternal God Bell of the star River. The eternal God Bell trembled and dense cracks appeared on it.</p><p>Xing Chen’s expression was ugly. He gritted his teeth and charged towards the golems.</p><p>In the past, no one in his generation could break his eternal God Bell. However, today, it was broken by Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>when I become an Emperor-to-be, I’ll definitely kill you!</p><p>Xing Chen roared in his heart. He was careless and took another punch. His body shook and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>At this moment, they were already very close to the golems.</p><p>Only after getting close did they discover that the golems were really too large and incomparably majestic. They were probably only as big as a strand of the golems ‘hair.</p><p>At this moment, a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>The stone golem suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p>This scene made Lu Ming, Heng Xinghe, and the others ’hearts race.</p><p>The golem opened its eyes!</p><p>Could it be that the celestial Thearch was not dead?</p><p>If it was true, it would be a huge matter.</p><p>The golem opened its eyes, only to see that its two eyeballs were like two deep abysses, pitch black.</p><p>The next moment, two rays of light shot out from the stone golem’s eyes and condensed into a figure in front of Lu Ming and Xing Chen.</p><p>He was dressed in a long robe, looking magnificent. He was around 30 years old and had a kind of spirit that cared about the world.</p><p>Wasn’t that the image of the heavenly Emperor?</p><p>At this moment, everyone seemed to have forgotten to breathe. They were all dumbfounded.</p><p>The celestial Thearch was really not dead?</p><p>“The descendant of the Heng family greets the celestial Emperor ancestor!”</p><p>Xing He suppressed his shock and bowed.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the junior generation pays his respects to the celestial Thearch!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>No matter what, the celestial Thearch was a senior expert, so it was normal for him to bow.</p><p>“Greetings, heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>The others also saluted the heavenly Emperor from afar.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s gaze swept across the crowd, there’s no need to be so polite. I’m already dead. What’s left of me now is only a trace. It’s like a candle in the wind that can be extinguished at any time!</p><p>These words caused everyone’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>It seemed that the heavenly Emperor had really fallen. This figure was just a trace of the heavenly Emperor’s Mark..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
