They were both at the great sage lower mastery. However, the tall youth’s spiritual body was only a low-tier heaven spiritual body, while ruan tianjiao’s spiritual body was a medium-tier heaven spiritual body. The other party was naturally no match for him.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The tall young man roared, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>An ant from the vast sea nine nations had actually injured him. This was unforgivable.</p><p>Before this, he was still acting high and mighty, looking down on the people of the vast sea and the nine nations. But now, he was injured by ruan tianjiao.</p><p>If he had lost at the hands of an elder, it would still be acceptable. However, ruan tianjiao’s age looked even younger than him. This made him feel like he had lost all face.</p><p>“Kill! All of you will die today!”</p><p>The tall youth roared and once again charged at ruan tianjiao, but after a few moves, he was forced back by ruan tianjiao.</p><p>how dare you hurt the heavenly beauty of our mysterious spirit Kingdom! You deserve to die!</p><p>On the other side, the other people who were with the tall young man also stood up with cold expressions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More and more people rushed out of the palace. A few of them were elders with powerful auras.</p><p>I told you to get lost. If you don’t get lost, you’re simply seeking your own death!</p><p>One of the old men had a cold expression as he stepped towards ruan tianjiao. His terrifying aura pressed down on ruan tianjiao, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“Absolute Saint!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s voice interrupted and he couldn’t help but cry out.</p><p>The other members of the vast sea nine nations also had a drastic change in their expressions.</p><p>Xuanling Kingdom was so powerful that even absolute Saints were here.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said. He took a step forward and appeared in front of ruan tianjiao, blocking his aura.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>Why was it that no matter where he went, he would always encounter such a self-proclaimed idiot?</p><p>In fact, there were many people like that in this world. With a little power and status, they would look down on those of lower status and feel superior in front of them.</p><p>Whenever he met someone of a higher status, he would immediately change into a humble appearance.</p><p>There were too many people like this!</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s back view, ruan tianjiao’s heart suddenly calmed down for some reason.</p><p>“I’ll give you one last chance, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Little bastard, are you crazy? since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish first!”</p><p>The absolute Saint elder’s eyes flashed coldly as he struck his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm force struck down, and the space howled wildly.</p><p>The people from xuanling Kingdom smiled smugly. Lu Ming would definitely die under this palm. They seemed to be able to see Lu Ming being killed.</p><p>But the next moment, their smiles froze.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the elder’s palm. The elder’s palm stopped in the air.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed to one of fear. No matter how he unleashed his holy power, Lu Ming’s palm did not move an inch.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>He was an absolute Saint, a high and mighty absolute Saint. How old was Lu Ming? how could he have such abilities?</p><p>“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. How sad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His holy power burst out and he swung it.</p><p>The old man’s body was thrown out and smashed heavily on the floor. The ground rumbled and the floor cracked. The old man’s body was embedded in the huge pit, twitching continuously.</p><p>Everyone’s expression froze.</p><p>Even the people from the vast sea nine nations knew that Lu Ming’s abilities were unfathomable. However, to witness a legendary absolute Saint being smashed to the ground by Lu Ming so easily, to the point that he was half-dead, was still a shocking scene.</p><p>In xuanling Kingdom, the tall young man’s face was pale and his body was trembling.</p><p>He found it hard to believe that there was such a powerful figure in the nine nations of the vast sea who could defeat an absolute Saint with one move.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed heavily on the absolute Saint elder.</p><p>The terrifying power shattered the absolute Saint elder’s Saint heart.</p><p>His Saint heart was broken, and his cultivation was destroyed.</p><p>The absolute Saint elder screamed in despair.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Another elder from xuanling Kingdom shouted, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the next moment, the sound of air being torn could be heard as many figures descended.</p><p>These were the powerhouses of the mysterious spirit Kingdom. They had been staying in their own palaces and not here. When they arrived and learned that Lu Ming had crippled an absolute Saint, they were shocked and filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>how dare you offend our mysterious spirit Kingdom! Kill!</p><p>An old woman with snow-white hair shouted. Her killing intent was like a blade.</p><p>The xuanling Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in the entire ten thousand sea realm. It was one of the few big kingdoms and could almost dominate the entire ten thousand sea realm, except for the time Island.</p><p>Now, a mere vastsea nine nations actually dared to cripple a person from xuanling Kingdom. They were simply courting death.</p><p>In an instant, at least ten ultimate Saints released their auras, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The two old men from the vast sea nine nations shook their heads speechlessly.</p><p>They knew Lu Ming’s strength. The mysterious spirit Kingdom dared to treat Lu Ming with such an attitude. They were simply courting death. They seemed to have seen the tragic state of the mysterious spirit Kingdom.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The white-haired old woman made the first move. A terrifying attack blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other absolute Saints also attacked. More than a dozen attacks were aimed at Lu Ming. They wanted to crush Lu Ming’s bones with one attack.</p><p>“You brought this upon yourself, you can’t live!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Then, he threw a punch. The air trembled, forming a terrifying force that destroyed the attacks of more than ten absolute Saints. “How is that possible?”</p><p>All the experts of xuanling Kingdom were shocked.</p><p>He destroyed the attacks of more than ten absolute Saints with one move. What kind of strength was this?</p><p>Not good!</p><p>They were shocked and felt a chill all over their bodies. They had a bad feeling. Some of them even retreated, but it was too late.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fists continuously, and streams of fist force rushed out with an unstoppable momentum, crushing those people.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The absolute Saints didn’t even have time to scream before they were blown into the air.</p><p>In an instant, only the white-haired old woman was left.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired old woman was terrified and began to escape.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the sky in the distance. It was filled with shock and anger.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear it. He threw another punch.</p><p>The white-haired old woman was directly blown up, her body and soul destroyed.</p><p>The surroundings fell into a deathly silence. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>More than ten absolute Saints had been killed in an instant. It was too terrifying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are your limits?”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao seemed to be numb, only a bitter smile and endless curiosity.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>An angry roar came from the sky. Then, more than ten figures appeared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
