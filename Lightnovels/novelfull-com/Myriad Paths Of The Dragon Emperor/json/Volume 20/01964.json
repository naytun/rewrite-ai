Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>This was because chaos crystals were formed by the condensation of chaos Qi.</p><p>During the auction, the other party had said that there was no chaos Qi left in the chaos gem, which was why the price had been so low.</p><p>However, no one had expected that the chaos gems contained chaos Qi. Instead, all the chaos Qi had gathered together and turned into chaos crystals.</p><p>Chaos crystals were nearly fused with chaos gems, so it was impossible to discover them without cracking the chaos gems.</p><p>Tve earned, I’ve really earned a lot!</p><p>Lu Ming checked carefully and confirmed that there were only two chaos crystals in the chaos gem.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately controlled the chaos laws and enveloped the two chaos crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the Laws of Chaos enveloped the chaos crystals, the two chaos crystals trembled slightly and floated in the air with the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>Then, the two chaos crystals melted like ice and turned into liquid. Finally, they turned into two streams of air.</p><p>Chaos Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Back then, he had fused a stream of chaos Qi into his body. Naturally, he could tell at a glance that these two streams of Qi were also chaos Qi.</p><p>“Then I’ll refine two more!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. With a thought, he controlled the chaos laws and guided the chaos Qi into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had already refined a stream of chaos Qi. It was very compatible with the chaos Qi and there was no difficulty in refining it.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Paopao had already recovered. She stayed at the entrance of the cave to protect Lu Ming.</p><p>In the past few days, terrifying roars would ring out from the depths of the cave from time to time, accompanied by the sound of iron chains clashing. It was as if a Supreme great demon was locked down below and was struggling to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming turned a deaf ear to all of this. He was focused on refining the chaos Qi.</p><p>In three days, the two wisps of chaos Qi had been completely refined into Lu Ming’s body. They seeped into his muscles, bones, blood, and permeated every part of his body.</p><p>The strength of Lu Ming’s physical body had greatly improved and was even more tyrannical.</p><p>His body seemed to have a layer of hazy light. With a thought, it would become as heavy as a mountain, indestructible and firm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, his body seemed to resonate with the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>When a warrior reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, he would be able to infuse his body with the laws. The laws would be highly compatible with his body. The laws would be contained in his body, which would increase the strength of his body.</p><p>At this moment, the chaos laws were constantly surging into Lu Ming’s body. His body was numb, as if a terrifying power was about to be born.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, a ray of light emerged from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Light of chaos, chirp chirp!”</p><p>At the side, Pao Pao blinked her large eyes, revealing a look of joy.</p><p>Lu Ming was refining two wisps of chaotic Qi. In addition to the previous one, he had three wisps of chaotic Qi in total, which greatly strengthened his spirit body. He also took advantage of the momentum and resonated with the Laws of Chaos, refining the light of chaos in one fell swoop.</p><p>The light of chaos was faint at first, but as time passed, its color became darker and darker. Finally, it turned into a ray of light of chaotic colors that surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming opened his eyes and the light of chaos was retracted into his body.</p><p>“My body’s strength has increased by another level!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and his eyes flashed.</p><p>He had not expected that the chaos gem he had bought unintentionally back then would actually allow him to refine the light of chaos. It was truly a great opportunity.</p><p>If he did not have the two strands of chaotic Qi, he did not know when he would be able to refine the chaotic light.</p><p>This time, although his cultivation did not advance, his combat strength had soared.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying roar sounded outside the cave. Gusts of strong wind whistled out from the depths of the cave.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>At the same time, there was the sound of iron chains colliding.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned serious.</p><p>He could not help but think of the divine time Island.</p><p>On the divine time Island, there was also a gigantic living being sealed within. It was chained up and was incomparably powerful and unfathomable.</p><p>The clanking of chains could be heard from this place as well. Could it be that there was a Supreme expert sealed beneath the cavern, just like the divine time Island?</p><p>The voice roared for a while before it stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles walked to the entrance of the cave and looked outside. They saw some figures leaping out of the caves and onto the stone bridges. With the help of the stone bridges, they went down.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a roar from the bottom of the cave. At the same time, a dazzling light burst out and shot into the sky.</p><p>There were people fighting in the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but channel the Holy power into his eyes. His vision instantly improved and he looked down into the cave.</p><p>This way, the scenery at the bottom of the cave became clear.</p><p>At the bottom of the cave, there was a huge platform. In the middle of the platform, there was a Palace.</p><p>Around the platform, there were four stone bridges that were connected to the walls of the cave.</p><p>At this moment, there was a group of people fighting on the platform.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit, Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed, and a murderous intent flashed in them.</p><p>At that moment, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and a few elders, who should be Emperor-to-be experts of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect, were being besieged by a group of people.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that they were from the Heng family because they used the eternal spring Law.</p><p>At this moment, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others were in danger. They were surrounded by the other party.</p><p>There were more people on the other side, and they were all Emperor-to-be, six of them.</p><p>On the other hand, there were only three emperors-to-be in Huang Ling’s group. There was still a gap between Huang Ling and Long Chen’s combat strength and an Emperor-to-be’s.</p><p>kill these three old guys first. Leave the two younger ones behind. These two have a close relationship with Lu Ming. Leave them behind and ask Lu Ming to exchange the celestial Thearch sword for them! he ordered.</p><p>One of the Heng family members said coldly.</p><p>Their attacks were like a storm, heading toward the three Emperor-to-be from Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect. As for Feng Ling and Long Chen, they only had to restrain them.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A burly elder of the divine elephant sect had his dantian pierced through by a sword from an Emperor-to-be of the Heng family. The elder roared and fought back with all his might, striking his opponent with a palm. However, the opponent quickly retreated after being stabbed. The burly elder of the divine elephant sect’s final counterattack before his death only slightly injured him, not seriously injuring him.</p><p>“Long Chen, you guys must get out of here!”</p><p>die! the tall and sturdy elder of the divine elephant sect roared in anger. His body fell heavily to the ground and he stopped breathing.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Long Chen roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>“Haha, 1 really want to rush out. Dream on!”</p><p>One of the Emperor-to-be from the Heng family sneered. He strode forward and attacked Huang Ling with a terrifying force. He wanted to take her down.</p><p>At this moment, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared and enveloped him. His body froze.</p><p>Then, a prison-suppressing stele fell from the sky and hit his body.</p><p>Bang! The body of this Emperor-to-be from the Heng family was torn into pieces..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
