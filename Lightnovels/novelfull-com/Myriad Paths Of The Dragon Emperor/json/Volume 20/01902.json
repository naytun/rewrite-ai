At the same time, he pointed out with his fingers. Huge chaos fingers of tribulation formed and pointed at the stars in the distance.</p><p>The chaotic finger was bigger than a star. Every time it touched a star, the star would explode like fireworks in the universe. It was a magnificent sight.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>“Primal Chaos Ring, 90% complete!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly, very satisfied.</p><p>&Nbsp; during this period of time, he had used the great Emperor’s Dao lecture to focus more on the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>The primal Chaos tribulation finger’s level of mastery had increased from 80% to 90%.</p><p>The higher the level of a sacred art, the more difficult it would be to improve it. The difficulty would continue to double.</p><p>If he were to cultivate normally, it would take a long time to raise it from 80% to 90%.</p><p>However, this time, with the help of the great Emperor’s enlightenment, Lu Ming overcame it in one fell swoop.</p><p>The power of the finger of tribulation of chaos had increased by a large margin.</p><p>Of course, it would be even more difficult to raise it from 90% to 100% completion. Every increase would require a lot of energy and effort.</p><p>“My cultivation base is about to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>His cultivation base had already reached the limit of the great sage perfection. He was just short of an opportunity to make a breakthrough.</p><p>&Nbsp; although he had focused on comprehending the primal Chaos tribulation finger, his cultivation had also increased, finally reaching the critical point.</p><p>On the fourth month of his enlightenment, Lu Ming’s body burst out with a shocking aura.</p><p>“Lu Ming is about to break through!”</p><p>“He’s about to reach absolute Saint!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already amazing when he was in the great sage perfection realm. He could suppress Luo pokong, who was in the initial absolute Saint realm. How powerful would his combat strength be after he broke through to the absolute Saint realm?</p><p>Many people were looking forward to it.</p><p>“Lu Ming is finally going to break through!”</p><p>The eyes of Feng Ling, Qiu Yue, and Long Chen lit up.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if you’ve broken through? It’s more interesting to kill like this!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong sneered, and his killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>As time passed, the aura on Lu Ming’s body grew stronger. He waved his hand and a large number of raw gemstones appeared. The devouring power burst out and these raw gemstones turned into rolling raw gemstones. They were devoured and absorbed by him, turning into Saint power.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming’s aura was completely retracted. His cultivation had officially entered the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>At this moment, Emperor formless, who had been sitting cross-legged this entire time, opened his eyes, alright, this time’s Dao enlightenment has come to an end. The next Dao lecture will be held three years later. At that time, another great emperor will come to give a Dao lecture!</p><p>With that, Emperor formless’s figure disappeared.</p><p>No one saw how the emperor’s figure disappeared. It was as if he had never been there.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared where Qiu Yue, Huang Ling, and the rest were.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the room and smiled. Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Huang Yuan, congratulations on your breakthrough to the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>He realized that it was not only Huang Ling and Long Chen who had broken through. A few members of the desolate race had also broken through, entering the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Most of the nine youths from the desolate race who had followed Lu Ming out were at the perfected great saint realm. Furthermore, they had stayed there for quite some time. This time, with the help of the great Emperor’s lecture, their cultivation levels had all broken through.</p><p>Although these people did not have King physiques, the desolate race’s combat strength was strong to begin with. Furthermore, they also had high-tier heavenly spiritual bodies, so their combat strength was not weak.</p><p>This way, they had quite a number of absolute Saints on their side.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve broken through too. 1 really don’t know how strong you are now.”</p><p>Long Chen said with a smile.</p><p>The others laughed as well. Indeed, Lu Ming’s combat power was already so strong when he was a Supreme Saint. Now that he had broken through to the absolute Saint realm, how strong would he be?</p><p>They were all very curious.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this time, a terrifying aura enveloped them, causing everyone’s expression to change as they looked in one direction.</p><p>Luo cangqiong stepped forward. Your terrifying aura came from Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Behind him, Luo pokong and the other paragons of the Daluo heaven sect followed.</p><p>“Qiuyue, come here, come to my side!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong looked at Qiu Yue and said. His tone was very domineering, as if he was giving an order.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, you don’t have to bother me anymore. I’ve told you that I have no feelings for you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Come here!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s voice became more serious and overbearing.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and ignored Luo cangqiong.</p><p>stop right there, Lu Ming. You dare to touch my woman? I’ll exterminate your entire family!</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s voice was like a thunderclap, ringing in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>In the surroundings, many heaven’s favorites who were about to leave stopped in their tracks and looked over curiously.</p><p>He had just finished comprehending the Dao, and a conflict was about to erupt?</p><p>And it was Luo cangqiong and Lu Ming. Many people were looking forward to it.</p><p>“Your woman? Hehe, what a joke. Qiu Yue grew up with me since young, when did she become your woman?”</p><p>“And Qiuyue herself said that she has no feelings for you and told you to stop pestering her. You really are shameless!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Luo cangqiong coldly.</p><p>“Do you know who you’re talking to? Because of what you said, you will drag your family and friends down with you. They will all die because of you!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said. His eyes were extremely cold as he glanced at Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others. He did not hide his killing intent at all.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? If you want to kill me, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Desolate li shouted, revealing a malevolent killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He hated it the most when people threatened him with his family.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, let me tell you this. Lu Ming is my young master. 1 once said that I would serve him for the rest of my life. I have no feelings for you. What’s the point of you pestering me?”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>b * tch, shut up. If 1 say you’re mine, you’re mine. No one can take you away from me. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Luo cangqiong shouted coldly.</p><p>His grandfather was a great emperor, a top expert in the world. Since he was young, he had gotten everything he wanted.</p><p>Women were the same!</p><p>hehe, what a joke. Qiu Yue doesn’t like you, so you used the law of deprivation to deprive her of her memories. What a pity that Qiu Yue still has no feelings for you. Such a laughable and despicable person still has the face to stay in the yuan mountain sacred Academy and be called a heaven’s chosen. What a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and his voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Many people were enlightened. So that was how it was.</p><p>Luo cangqiong couldn’t win Qiu Yue’s heart, so he used the law of deprivation to deprive Qiu Yue’s memory. It was indeed shameless.</p><p>“So what?”</p><p>Luo cangqiong opened his mouth, and his eyes became even colder, it seems that you’ve recovered your memory, you b * tch. 1’11 strip you of it again. This time, 1’11 strip you of all your memories. Lu Ming, I’ll cripple your cultivation and make you watch Qiu Yue become my woman!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Luo cangqiong continued to take steps forward. With each step, the sky would shake violently..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
