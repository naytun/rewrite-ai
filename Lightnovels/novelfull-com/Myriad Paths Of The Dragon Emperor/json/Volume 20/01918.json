There are only a few people in the yuan mountain who can compare to your achievements!</p><p>The skinny old man he Qian smiled and then changed the topic,”Xiangxiang, what 1 said before about you acknowledging me as your master, have you considered it?”</p><p>“Xiangxiang thanks senior for your kindness, but Xiangxiang already has a master. Without master’s consent, Xiangxiang doesn’t dare to take another person as a master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella bowed politely and rejected the other party.</p><p>He Qian’s expression darkened. Xiangxiang, you have to consider this carefully. I’m a true Emperor. What’s your master’s cultivation? ”</p><p>although my master’s cultivation is not high now, Xiangxiang Bella believes that my master will definitely become a peak expert in this world in the future!</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella said with a determined look in her eyes.</p><p>In her heart, Lu Ming was the strongest. Although his cultivation level was not as high as he Qian’s for the time being, he would surpass he Qian sooner or later.</p><p>silly girl, it’s not that easy to become a top expert of the yuan continent. Moreover, he can’t even protect his own disciple, what achievements can he have? he might have already fallen by now. You’re still young, don’t be deceived by a few flowery words of others!</p><p>He Qian said with a smile, thinking that Xiang Xiang had the temperament of a child and did not know anything.</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella’s face slightly sank as she said,” senior He Yan, you have saved Xiangxiang Bella, Grandpa Valley master, and martial uncle Tian Chui. Xiangxiang Bella is grateful to you. However, please do not insult my master. Otherwise, Xiangxiang Bella will have to take her leave!</p><p>alright, alright, alright. 1 won’t force you. You can take your time to think about it. However, you have to cultivate the Four Seasons technique that I’m going to teach you. It’s very compatible with your physique and can stimulate your potential to a greater extent. Your talent is unparalleled, and I really don’t want to see you being held back and wasting such talent!</p><p>He Qian sighed, but no one saw the cold glint that flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Mm, alright!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella nodded her head, and only then did her expression look a little better.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, you and your martial uncle Tian Chui should go back first. I have something to discuss with Grandpa Valley master!”</p><p>He Qian said with a smile.</p><p>en, okay. Goodbye, senior he Qian. Goodbye, Grandpa Valley master!</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella obediently nodded her head. After saying goodbye to he Qian and valley master Ice Dragon, she and Tian Chui soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>As soon as Xiangxiang Beila and Tian Chui left, he Xiao’s face darkened. He coldly looked at Ice Dragon Valley master, and a terrifying aura pressed down on him.</p><p>&Nbsp;” ah! Ice Dragon Valley master’s body trembled, and he couldn’t help but retreat, his face deathly pale.</p><p>He Qian was a true Emperor expert. In front of him, Ice Dragon Valley master had no power to resist.</p><p>“I told you to persuade Xiangxiang to acknowledge me as her master, but it seems you didn’t!”</p><p>He Qian said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“It’s Xiangxiang’s own choice who she wants to take as her master. What’s the use of me persuading her? If she wanted to be your disciple, why would she need my advice?”</p><p>Valley master Ice Dragon said.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>“Hmph!” He Qian snorted coldly and said,”then What if 1 told you to persuade Xiangxiang to cultivate the Four Seasons technique? Have you persuaded him?” A strange light flashed in the eyes of Ice Dragon Valley master as he stared at he Xiao and said,” “Why do you insist on letting Xiangxiang cultivate the Four Seasons technique?”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about this, just persuade her to cultivate!”</p><p>He Gao said.</p><p>&Nbsp;” kill me! Ice Dragon Valley master sneered, you can kill me. No matter what, 1 won’t force Xiangxiang Beila to do anything she doesn’t want to do!</p><p>“You want to court death? it’s not that easy!”</p><p>He Qian said coldly, a cold light flashing through his eyes.</p><p>Then, the Ice Dragon Valley master’s body began to tremble, as if he was suffering from endless pain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After a moment, even with Ice Dragon Valley master’s composure, he couldn’t bear it anymore. A painful roar came out of his throat, and his gentle face was completely twisted by the pain.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master kept growling, his entire body covered in cold sweat. He reached out with his claws, wanting to grab his body, but an invisible energy covered him, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>soul devouring insects can constantly tear your soul and make you suffer incomparable pain. It’s ten times or even a hundred times more painful than the pain of your physical body. Enjoy it!</p><p>He Qian coldly spoke.</p><p>“You … If Xiangxiang Beila were to find out that you are so despicable, I’m afraid that she would immediately leave …”</p><p>&Nbsp;” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>“If she leaves, it will be the day of your death!”</p><p>He Qian said coldly.</p><p>&Nbsp;” no! Ice Dragon Valley master roared once more. He felt as if his soul was being continuously bitten by a type of insect, and endless pain drowned him.</p><p>After a while, he Qian waved his hand, controlling the soul devouring insects to stop their biting. Ice Dragon Valley master’s body fell limply to the ground, gasping for breath. His entire body was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>I’ll give you two more months to persuade Xiangxiang. Persuade her to take me as her master and cultivate the Four Seasons technique with me. Otherwise, you’ll wish you were dead!</p><p>“Also, don’t try to tell Xiangxiang, or you’re seeking your own death. Otherwise, Xiangxiang and Tian Chui will both die!”</p><p>He Qian said coldly. Then, he took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master took a few deep breaths, then sat down cross-legged and began to circulate his energy to recover. Half an hour later, he had finally recovered.</p><p>“He Yan, why are you so persistent in wanting Xiangxiang to cultivate the Four Seasons technique? This person is sinister and cunning. He definitely isn’t doing this for Xiangxiang’s good like he said. Now, what should we do?” &Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master frowned in thought.</p><p>In front of Xiang Xiang, he Qian always put on an affable appearance, but after Xiang Xiang left, he would reveal his true face.</p><p>He planted a soul devouring insect in his body and threatened him to persuade Xiangxiang to be he Xiao’s master.</p><p>The master of Ice Dragon Valley would never allow Xiangxiang Beila to be he Xiao’s disciple. However, this place was the he family.</p><p>There were many experts in the he family. With his cultivation at the initial success stage of the absolute Saint realm, any one of them could kill him.</p><p>He wanted to take Xiangxiang and the others away, but he was completely powerless. If he was not careful, he might even implicate Xiangxiang and the others.</p><p>He returned to his residence with a heavy heart.</p><p>Their residence was a huge courtyard. There were experts guarding the courtyard, so not even a fly could fly out.</p><p>“Grandpa Valley master, what did senior he Qian say to you?”</p><p>The moment Ice Dragon Valley master returned to the courtyard, he saw Xiangxiang Beila and asked curiously.</p><p>“Nothing much? I’m just asking senior he Qian about Lu Ming and the rest’s whereabouts!”</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master randomly found an excuse, and then his face darkened. “Xiangxiang, you didn’t cultivate the Four Seasons technique that He Yan gave you, right?”</p><p>“Didn’t Grandpa Valley master tell me not to cultivate? that’s why I didn’t cultivate!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila shook her head and said.</p><p>en, remember, do not cultivate it. Just cultivate the cultivation technique that your master gave you!</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master warned.</p><p>“Yes, Xiang Xiang knows!”</p><p>Although Xiangxiang Beila was curious as to why ice Dragon Valley’s master would not allow her to cultivate the Four Seasons technique, she still obediently nodded her head. This was because she knew that Ice Dragon Valley’s master would not harm her..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
