Even they did not know why. It might be related to Lu Ming representing the mingyan country this time?</p><p>In their past memories, the divine Emperor was a lofty figure who looked down on the world. He was a top expert in the ten thousand sea realm. But now, Lu Ming could fight against nine people at once. It was too shocking.</p><p>“Is this the son of chaos? His combat strength is truly heaven-defying!”</p><p>Not only were there people from the ten thousand sea realm, but there were also people from the outside world. There were many of them who were attracted by the commotion and came to watch. Someone sighed.</p><p>Not only the spectators, but even the Emperor-to-be from the Heng family and the others were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually block them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng family shouted and was the first to make a move again. He cast a magical technique and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the other emperors-to-be also attacked.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he stared at the quasi-Emperor of the WAN family and charged at him.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming waved his hand and nine huge prison-suppressing steles appeared. They pressed down on the others while Lu Ming continued to charge at the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family.</p><p>Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>Lu Ming attacked with all his might and launched a chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>The primal Chaos finger of tribulation destroyed the attack of the Heng family’s Emperor-to-be and forced him to retreat rapidly with blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The other eight people’s attacks collided with the prison-suppressing stele’s shadow that Lu Ming had condensed. There was a constant rumble and the nine prison-suppressing stele’s shadow was destroyed. The remaining power surged towards Lu Ming, causing his body to tremble and blood to flow from his mouth.</p><p>However, Lu Ming made use of this force to charge at the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family even faster.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened the lid of the Dayan elixir furnace. A terrifying suction force erupted from the furnace and was about to suck the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family in.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng clan was shocked. He struggled madly and shouted,” “Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other eight powerhouses attacked at the same time. The sun, Gale, giant wolf, and the others all charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with madness.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>With a thought, hundreds of Saint weapons gathered into a giant shield and blocked behind him. Then, he pointed at the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The attacks of the eight emperors-to-be landed on the shield made up of hundreds of Saint weapons. The shield exploded, and some of the bright Saint weapons and great saint weapons were shattered into pieces.</p><p>Only a dozen or so absolute Saint weapons didn’t explode.</p><p>A total of two hundred Saint weapons had been destroyed just like that. This was a huge loss.</p><p>However, it was all worth it. This had also bought Lu Ming some time.</p><p>Under the primal Chaos tribulation finger, the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family was almost blown apart. He spat out a mouthful of blood. How could he resist the pull of the DA yan elixir furnace?</p><p>He struggled madly, but he was still swallowed by the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>After closing the furnace lid, Lu Ming started to activate the furnace fire to refine the other party.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Inside the furnace, the other party was frantically attacking, wanting to rush out.</p><p>However, given Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, how could he, an ordinary Emperor-to-be, rush out of the cauldron?</p><p>attack and save the Emperor-to-be of the Heng family!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Golden Crow race let out a long howl and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other Emperor-to-be also launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used the Dayan elixir furnace to block it. Although he was at a disadvantage, the other party could not seriously injure him in a short period of time.</p><p>“Saint Emperor, this person is lawless. If you attack now, you can kill him!”</p><p>Xuan Chuan sent a message to the three sacred emperors of the divine time Island.</p><p>The three emperors-to-be from the divine time Island looked at each other and saw the killing intent in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had to pay the price for killing several experts on the divine time Island. Otherwise, where would the dignity of the divine time Island be?</p><p>The three of them nodded and stepped forward at the same time, their bodies exuding a mysterious aura.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The sacred Emperor of the divine time Island was about to make his move as well.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao was extremely worried.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was clearly at a disadvantage. If the three quasi-emperors of the divine time Island were added to the mix, Lu Ming would be even more disadvantaged.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three emperors-to-be from the divine time Island did not hesitate and attacked at the same time. Three terrifying divine lights shot toward Lu Ming, and there was actually a trace of time power in them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he was ready to resist with all his might.</p><p>However, at this moment, the space around them started to ripple. A huge transparent bubble appeared and enveloped the three emperors-to-be from the divine time Island.</p><p>Bubbles!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Bubbles had entered the myriad sea realm with him. To his surprise, he had also arrived at the divine time Island.</p><p>Bubbles appeared beside Lu Ming and he muttered,” so many of you are fighting brother Lu Ming. I’ll fight you too, chirpy!</p><p>Bubbles continued to form as she mumbled to herself. With a wave of her hand, more transparent bubbles were formed and enveloped the quasi-emperors of the Golden Crow race and the WAN clan.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to attack the Emperor-to-be of the WAN family.</p><p>He had just lost so many Saint weapons, so he might as well get them back from this quasi-Emperor of the WAN clan.</p><p>&Nbsp; the enemy was covered by the spacetime law and was struggling madly, trying to break it.</p><p>However, with bubble’s current realm and space-time law, how could it be so easy to break?</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Dayan elixir furnace and smashed it at the other party’s face.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace smashed onto the quasi-Emperor of the WAN family’s head. The quasi-Emperor’s head was almost split open. He was completely dazed.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed an absolute holy weapon saber beside him and slashed down.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the WAN clan was split into two.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be had fallen.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>The spectators from the ten thousand sea realm were all shocked.</p><p>This was a figure equivalent to a Sage Emperor, yet he had been killed just like that.</p><p>The sacred Emperor was at the peak of the ten thousand sea realm. It was synonymous with invincibility. It turned out that even an invincible Sacred Emperor could die.</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>In addition to the one inside the Dayan elixir furnace that was already silent, there were already two.</p><p>Two of the Saint emperors had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Who was this young man?</p><p>Thoughts ran through the minds of the ten thousand sea realm Warriors.</p><p>At this time, the others had already broken through the space-time law and gathered together, their eyes extremely solemn.</p><p>space-time law, it’s the space-time law!</p><p>The sacred Emperor of the divine time Island cried out in excitement.</p><p>Their nomological laws also contained a trace of time power. However, compared to bubbles, they were still far from it.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then kill to your heart’s content today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent grew stronger. He stepped on the air and headed for the remaining Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Since they wanted to kill him, he would slaughter them all.</p><p>The remaining emperors-to-be looked solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already terrifying enough. In addition to bubbles, who had mastered the space-time law, their combat strength was amazing..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
