After a few minutes, the fluctuations in the void suddenly stopped.</p><p>The spatial cracks also disappeared.</p><p>He stopped!</p><p>Who won?</p><p>Was it the great emperor of the Heng clan or Emperor formless?</p><p>withdraw from the yuan mountain sacred Academy and send people to guard the area outside the academy. If Lu Ming goes out, capture him immediately!</p><p>The voice of the Emperor came from the Heng family.</p><p>The Heng clan was going to leave the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flashed. Could it be that the Emperor of the Heng family had been defeated?</p><p>It was very possible. If the Heng clan Emperor won, he wouldn’t leave the yuan mountain sacred Academy so easily.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three true emperors from the Heng clan acknowledged the order and cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. Then, they stepped out and left the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Xing Chen’s eyes were filled with unwillingness.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in the sky. It was Emperor formless.</p><p>“Greetings, great emperor!”</p><p>Everyone bowed and paid their respects to Emperor formless.</p><p>“Now, I have an announcement to make!”</p><p>Emperor formless’s eyes were no longer gentle. Instead, they were filled with a sharp light. Anyone who met his gaze would feel their hearts race.</p><p>from tomorrow onwards, the rules of the yuan mountain sacred Academy will change. From now on, there will be no prohibition of killing in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. In other words, there will be no rules in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice rang out.</p><p>The hearts of many trembled. From tomorrow onwards, the yuan mountain sacred Academy would no longer prohibit killing. There would no longer be any rules.</p><p>This would definitely cause a huge change in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>In the past, killing was forbidden in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. It was forbidden to cripple the cultivation of others. If one wanted to determine life and death, they had to fight on the life-and-death battle stage.</p><p>If they didn’t step onto the life-and-death battle stage, they would be safe in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. At the very least, they wouldn’t have to worry about their lives.</p><p>But all of this would change.</p><p>in the future, the teachers of the sacred Institute won’t care about your Affairs. Of course, all of this is the internal affairs of the sacred Institute. If any external forces interfere, we will strike them with lightning!</p><p>also, I’ve placed four sets of formation disks in the Holy battlefield. Each formation disk can cover an area of a hundred miles. Only martial sovereigns can break it!</p><p>After saying this, Emperor formless’s figure blurred like a Phantom and then disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Little guys, take care!”</p><p>The teachers of the sacred Academy glanced at the crowd and left one after another, disappearing into the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>As soon as the teachers of the Saint Academy left, the atmosphere became extremely heavy.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, their eyes filled with solemness and wariness.</p><p>From tomorrow onwards, there would be no ban on killing. Those who had grudges with each other would look at each other with cold killing intent.</p><p>Luo cangqiong, Heng Xinghe, and the rest swept their gazes over Lu Ming and the others. They did not even bother to conceal their undisguised killing intent. “Lu Ming, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>let’s go! Xing Chen said coldly. Then, his body flickered and he was the first to leave.</p><p>After the star River left, the death blade turned into a blade light and disappeared.</p><p>This made the eyes of some powerful heaven’s favorites light up.</p><p>It seemed that the death blade was not on Lu Ming’s side. Just like what the death blade had said, he attacked Lu Ming purely because he found the Galaxy unpleasant to the eye.</p><p>Some of the more powerful heaven’s favorites let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>If the death blade was also in Lu Ming’s group, then the strength of Lu Ming’s group was too shocking. If they could fight against the eternal Star River when they joined forces, they would be almost invincible in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, without the death blade, the strength of Lu Ming’s group was greatly reduced.</p><p>“That death blade guy left without even saying goodbye!”</p><p>Huang Ling muttered unhappily.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and did not mind.</p><p>As the son of death, death blade naturally had his pride. He was not convinced by Lu Ming at all. He most likely wanted to wait for twenty years to challenge Lu Ming and replace him as the Golden inheritor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was confident that he would definitely make the death blade convinced within twenty years.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He, Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the rest stepped into the air and left.</p><p>After that, the others also left.</p><p>From tomorrow onwards, the yuan mountain sacred Academy would no longer prohibit killing. They naturally had to make early preparations.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s residence, everyone gathered in a courtyard to discuss some matters.</p><p>from tomorrow on, the situation of the sacred Institute will definitely change greatly. How should we face it? ”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“It’s best for us to gather together and concentrate our strength to avoid being defeated one by one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he looked at Ouyang Wushuang and Luo Tianyi and said, Ouyang, Tianyi, bring all the people you can bring here. We’ll gather together!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and Luo Tianyi nodded and agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Other than Feng Ling and Long Chen, the others were shocked.</p><p>Luo Tianyi and Ouyang Wushuang seemed to be very obedient to Lu Ming, which shocked them.</p><p>during this period of time, we’d better not go to those cultivation places to cultivate. We’ll make plans after the situation has stabilized!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This was the best choice now.</p><p>This mountain peak was very large, and everyone chose to stay in a courtyard.</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye. From the second day onwards, the atmosphere of the entire Yuan mountain sacred Academy became tense and everyone was on guard.</p><p>It has already been almost a year since the yuan mountain sacred Academy convened. Many people had grudges with each other. In the past, they couldn’t kill each other. At most, they could teach each other a lesson to vent their anger. But now, things were different.</p><p>As expected, the massacre began a few days later.</p><p>Some heaven’s favorites were killed on the spot.</p><p>This also opened the prologue of chaos in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The tragic battle began.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not far from the mountain where Lu Ming and the rest lived, a shocking fluctuation burst out on a mountain peak. Two figures rushed out from the mountain peak and engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>However, the battle didn’t last for long. A terrifying sword light flashed by, and a Young heaven’s favorite was cut in half, dying here.</p><p>The other elite took the storage ring and turned into a beam of sword light, disappearing.</p><p>“I wonder how many heaven’s favorites will die!”</p><p>A few figures stood in the air and watched. They were Lu Ming, Huang Ling, Luo Tianyi, and the others. Huang Ling sighed slightly.</p><p>perhaps this is the great Emperor’s strategy. Only by facing danger at all times can one tap into one’s potential faster and more thoroughly, and break into a higher realm!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said.</p><p>The few of them nodded. However, the price to pay for this method was huge.</p><p>I wonder why the great emperors are holding a meeting at the yuan mountain sacred Academy to nurture so many geniuses!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and asked.</p><p>The others were silent. This was actually what everyone had in mind.</p><p>Why did the emperors spend so much effort to gather so many geniuses and nurture them?</p><p>Most of the heaven’s favorites here came from the major forces. If they were successful in the future, they would definitely return to their forces.. What good would that do for the emperors?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
