At this time, during the great Emperor’s Dao lecture, they had some enlightenment and directly broke through.</p><p>However, this was the first time someone had broken through to the absolute Saint realm with a King body.</p><p>The man took out a large number of raw gemstones and began to absorb the raw energy to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Breaking through to the absolute Saint realm caused a huge commotion, but the remaining people were protected by the emperor’s energy. They weren’t disturbed at all and could comprehend the Dao in peace.</p><p>A few days later, the person who had broken through retracted his aura and opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>He had a King physique. Now that he had broken through to the absolute Saint realm, his combat power had increased dramatically. He could be considered one of the people who had entered the peak of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>He looked at the remaining people and his face darkened.</p><p>Out of all the king physiques, he was the first to end his enlightenment. Could it be that his talent and potential were the worst among the king physiques?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>He found it hard to accept this. He thought that he had ended his enlightenment early because of his breakthrough.</p><p>I’d like to see who will be the last one to finish the Enlightenment. Will it be the Galaxy, the death blade, or Lu Ming? ”</p><p>His gaze swept across the galaxy, the death blade, and Lu Ming. Then, he took a step forward and left the place, watching from a distance.</p><p>From then on, a King physique would wake up every day.</p><p>The cultivation of these King bodies was very high. Some were absolute Saints, some were Supreme Saints, and the lowest cultivation was peak Supreme Saint.</p><p>Many Supreme Saints with King bodies had broken through to the next realm, but not many absolute Saints.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two and a half months later, a shocking aura burst out of Long Chen’s body. He had also made a breakthrough, from the Great Perfection of the Supreme Saint to the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>On the second day, a powerful aura burst out from Huang Ling’s body. She had also begun her breakthrough.</p><p>They had been in the great sage Great Perfection for a long time. They had been cultivating in the yuan mountain Saint Academy. Now, they had finally broken through.</p><p>The two of them broke through one after another, which made the paragons of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect overjoyed.</p><p>After Huang Ling and Long Chen woke up, Qiu Yue, Luo Xiang, and Huang Li also woke up.</p><p>Qiu Yue had just broken through to the absolute Saint realm not long ago, so naturally, she hadn’t broken through so quickly. However, she had also gained a lot. Her cultivation was much closer to the absolute Saint realm, and her super powers had improved a lot.</p><p>As for Luo Xiang, due to his lack of accumulation, he didn’t break into the absolute Saint realm, but he had reached the limit of the great saint perfection.</p><p>As for desolate li, he had become an absolute Saint five months ago. Although he hadn’t broken through yet, he had reached the limit of the lower-tier absolute Saint realm. He wasn’t far from the upper-tier absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Everyone’s gains were huge.</p><p>As time passed, the remaining King physiques also woke up one by one.</p><p>Suddenly, a shocking aura burst out from one of the remaining cultivators.</p><p>Someone else had broken through.</p><p>It was Luo cangqiong!</p><p>haha, my elder brother Luo cangqiong has broken through. He has entered the perfected absolute Saint realm from the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>Luo pokong was ecstatic.</p><p>He had actually entered the great circle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was already very powerful. He was ranked 10th on the Saint King ranking. Of course, the Saint King ranking might not be accurate, but it was still not a small matter.</p><p>At this moment, his cultivation had broken through and he was undoubtedly even stronger.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others didn’t look good.</p><p>Luo cangqiong was destined to be their enemy. If he broke through, it would be disadvantageous to them.</p><p>Not long after, Luo cangqiong finished his breakthrough and woke up.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>After Luo cangqiong woke up, he looked at Lu Ming, who was still comprehending Dao, and snorted coldly. A cold killing intent flashed in his eyes. He wanted to take this opportunity to kill Lu Ming, but he didn’t dare to make a move when he saw Emperor formless sitting there.</p><p>If he offended a great emperor, even his grandfather wouldn’t be able to protect him.</p><p>“It won’t be too late to kill you after you wake up!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong murmured and then left the place to watch from a distance.</p><p>Three months later, there were only three people who were still comprehending Dao.</p><p>Galaxy, death blade, and Lu Ming.</p><p>“As expected, the three of them were the last to leave. The Son of God is indeed extraordinary!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Hmph, it’s just that you’ve been comprehending Dao for a little longer, but that doesn’t mean anything. Who can say for sure how high your future achievements will be in the future!</p><p>A King physique snorted coldly, obviously unconvinced.</p><p>that’s right. Although the sons of heaven are strong, their advantage is not as obvious after they become martial sovereigns. Furthermore, their future achievements may not be higher than that of the body of the king. In history, many body of the king’s final achievements have surpassed the sons of heaven!</p><p>“That’s right, there are even some who didn’t have a King physique but reached the peak and surpassed the Son of Heaven!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>Those standing here were all proud geniuses. How could they easily submit to others?</p><p>Being ahead now did not mean that he would always be ahead in the future. After becoming a martial Supreme, everything would become possible.</p><p>Another ten days passed.</p><p>On this day, Heng Xinghe and the death blade both ended their enlightenment at the same time and opened their eyes.</p><p>The two of them didn’t break through because it was rumored that they had just broken through before the great Emperor’s Dao lecture.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other with a cold glint in their eyes. Then, they turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was still in the midst of enlightenment.</p><p>Death blade’s eyes flickered, and he seemed to be thinking of something. Then, he moved and left.</p><p>As for Heng Xinghe, his eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>He had thought that he would be the last one to finish his enlightenment. He had not expected that there would be someone who had persevered longer than him.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming? He he he!”</p><p>The Galaxy sneered, took a step forward, and flew into the sky far away.</p><p>At the scene, Lu Ming was the only one who was still comprehending Dao.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>1 didn’t expect Lu Ming to last longer than the stellar River and the death blade. It’s amazing.</p><p>could it be that his talent and potential are higher than the Galaxy and the death blade?”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Hmph, who knows if this person is just putting on an act. In fact, he’s already awake, but he’s deliberately pretending to still be comprehending Dao!</p><p>Said Luo pokong, his eyes filled with jealousy.</p><p>“Are you doubting Emperor notionless’s judgment? You’re making yourself look stupid by saying this!”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at Luo pokong and said sarcastically.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, Qiu Yue had completely returned to her old personality-obedient and well-behaved.</p><p>However, in front of others, he looked completely different, just like before he lost his memory. This might have something to do with Qiu Yue’s recent experiences.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Luo pokong was stunned. His face was gloomy, but he could not refute.</p><p>Emperor notionless was still there. If Lu Ming had put on an act, how could</p><p>Emperor notionless not know? he would have asked him to leave long ago..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
