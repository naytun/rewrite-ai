Some of the powerful geniuses there were also paid attention to by many forces.</p><p>After all, if these geniuses didn’t die, they would definitely become the rulers of the yuan mountain in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the storage rings of quasi-Emperor Jin Wu and the others and continued to fly above the island.</p><p>The others also gathered their emotions and began to observe the surroundings.</p><p>The area of the island was not small. However, it did not take Lu Ming long to finish touring it.</p><p>After flying one round, Lu Ming did not meet any familiar faces.</p><p>it seems that only a small portion of the people who entered the world of petals have appeared on this Island. The others should be in other places!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that no one lived on the island. It was filled with lush forests and some weak demonic beasts.</p><p>it seems that if 1 want to know the situation of this world, 1 have to leave this place first!</p><p>“I wonder if there’s anyone living in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild. Then, he flew into the distance and into the vast sea.</p><p>The Lotus World was sealed under the heavenly Emperor mountain. It should be related to the heavenly Emperor. If he could get some of the treasures left by the heavenly Emperor, it would definitely be an unparalleled opportunity.</p><p>The rest of the people walked around the island and left one after another, flying toward the boundless ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a ray of light and sped across the sea at an astonishing speed.</p><p>During this period, he saw huge sea beasts in the sea. However, most of them did not have high cultivation. The strongest sea beast he had seen was only at the bright Saint realm.</p><p>He did not know if Lu Ming was unlucky or what, but he did not see the next island as he flew.</p><p>This world was bigger than Lu Ming had imagined.</p><p>Lu Ming had been flying for seven days. He did not know how far he had flown.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. A huge island had appeared in front of him.</p><p>From a distance, this Island was extremely majestic and vast. It was much larger than the previous Island.</p><p>Lu Ming flew towards the island. As he neared, he heard a loud shout coming from a direction.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he flew in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Not long after, he saw an empty land. There was an Army riding on strange beasts, galloping across the earth with a majestic aura. The earth kept shaking.</p><p>most of them are at the spiritual God Realm. There are also some at the martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan the area and discovered the general cultivation level of this soldier.</p><p>Tens of thousands of soldiers ran back and forth on the vast land. Their auras intersected and converged into a flood Dragon that roared into the sky.</p><p>Based on Lu Ming’s experience, it was not difficult for him to tell that this was an Army Training.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled in the void and looked around. He realized that there was a huge military camp nearby.</p><p>“Stop! Who are you?”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout was heard and a few figures appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>“Everyone, I’m just passing by and want to find someone to inquire about some information!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and smiled.</p><p>to gather information. 1 think you’re a spy. Men, take him down and bring him to young master Yan!</p><p>A middle-aged burly man with a gloomy expression waved his hand. A few armored figures stepped forward and surrounded Lu Ming, their cold killing intent enveloping Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head secretly. These people were only around the seventh level Martial Emperor realm. Lu Ming could kill them with a single thought.</p><p>these people’s cultivation is low and they’re no threat to me. Why don’t I go and meet that young master Yan and ask about the situation in this world? ”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind. He did not resist and said,” “I’ll go with you!”</p><p>“Take him away!”</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand and took the lead.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a military camp and walked into a huge military tent.</p><p>There were a few figures standing on both sides of the tent. Lu Ming scanned them with his spiritual senses and found that they were all half-Saints. One of them had even reached the initial bright Saint realm.</p><p>At the top of the military tent sat a young master in luxurious clothes. His gaze was cold and arrogant as he looked down at Lu Ming from above.</p><p>young master Yan, this person suddenly broke into the military camp. 1 suspect that he is a spy sent by another country to spy on our military intelligence. I will bring him here and hand him over to young master to deal with!</p><p>The middle-aged man saluted the young master with a humble attitude..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
