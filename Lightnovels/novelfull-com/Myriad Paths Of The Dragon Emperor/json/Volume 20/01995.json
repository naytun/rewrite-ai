You should’ve thought of this when you lured the three-eyed God race to harm us!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He had a deep killing intent towards Feng wuchen.</p><p>The Saint power gathered and formed a long spear, stabbing toward Feng wuchen’s head.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Feng wuchen’s head and nailed him to the ground.</p><p>Feng wuchen struggled a few times and stopped breathing.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>A peerless King physique died just like that. He was killed by Lu Ming in public in the Wind Clan’s Palace in front of countless experts.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor roared. The power of his world burst forth and he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Feng wuchen was the hope of the Wind Clan. Now that he was dead, he must kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“It seems like you want to die!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice came from the walking stick.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the sword was unsheathed, and the sound of the sword resounded through the sky.</p><p>Everyone only saw a flash of sword light. Then, they saw the wind race’s true Emperor’s body freeze in the air and all his aura disappeared without a trace. Then, a bloody gash appeared on the true Emperor’s forehead, and he was cut in half.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Many people swallowed their saliva, their hearts trembling.</p><p>A true Emperor was killed just like that.</p><p>It was the same as a few years ago!</p><p>“You’ve gone too far!”</p><p>At this time, an angry roar came from the distance. Then, a terrifying whistling sound rang out in the sky.</p><p>In the distance, an endless storm swept over, covering the sky and the sun, shrouding the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>At this moment, many people felt like it was the end of the world.</p><p>It was as if the heavens and earth were about to collapse. It was a terrifying sight.</p><p>The wind was like countless divine weapons. The space was cut open like tofu, revealing a ferocious spatial crack.</p><p>In the endless wind, there was a tall and majestic figure, as if he was indomitable, like a Demon God.</p><p>A terrifying pressure pressed down on everyone, making it hard for them to breathe.</p><p>“Chief!”</p><p>“The chief is here, they’re dead!”</p><p>The experts of the wind race were overjoyed.</p><p>“It’s the Wind Clan’s patriarch!”</p><p>“Peak true Emperor!”</p><p>There were also true Emperor experts from the other forces. At this moment, someone spoke with an extremely solemn voice.</p><p>Peak true Emperor!</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>The wind race’s true Emperor that had just been killed by uncle Kong had only become a true Emperor not long ago. He was a one-star true Emperor.</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch was a seven-star true Emperor.</p><p>The difference in strength between the two of them was too great.</p><p>It seemed that the Wind Clan was enraged, and the clan leader had personally taken action.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that kid, is dead for sure!”</p><p>“And that old fellow from the great Yan elixir Palace is also dead, haha!”</p><p>The Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, and the other forces were overjoyed.</p><p>‘Lu Ming, uncle Kong, weren’t you arrogant? you’ve kicked an iron plate now.’</p><p>Who else could compete with a peak true Emperor other than a great emperor?</p><p>They didn’t believe that uncle Kong was this strong.</p><p>“Today, I’ll let you all be buried with wuchen!”</p><p>A cold and emotionless voice rang out from the endless violent wind. The violent wind swept towards uncle Kong, Lu Ming, and the rest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a long sword being unsheathed rang out again. A sword light burst out, splitting the entire sky in half.</p><p>It was truly split into two. The entire sky was split open, revealing a terrifying dark void.</p><p>The Wind Clan leader’s boundless Gale was like a weak candle flame. It instantly vanished without a trace. Then, everyone heard a mournful scream. A figure frantically retreated. Drops of blood scattered across the sky.</p><p>In the distance, a middle-aged man in green robes appeared. His face was pale and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>This was the clan leader of the Wind Clan!</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>The clan leader of the Feng clan was injured. This was a peak true Emperor, the clan leader of an ancient clan, and an Overlord of a region. Yet, such a character was injured by a single sword strike. Blood splattered across the sky. This was too terrifying.</p><p>More importantly, the other party hadn’t even appeared. He was only controlling a sword from a distance, but it already had such terrifying power. It made it difficult for one to calm down.</p><p>great emperor? could he be a great emperor expert? ”</p><p>Someone said with great difficulty, his voice filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>Controlling a long sword from a distance and making a peak true Emperor spill blood in one move-who else but a great emperor could do such a thing?</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>Ancient Moon Holy Land actually had a hidden great emperor!</p><p>The elder from the great Yan elixir Palace was actually a great emperor. Everyone’s heart trembled at the thought.</p><p>Although the difference between a peak true Emperor and a great emperor was only one step, this step was like heaven and earth. It was difficult to cross.</p><p>In particular, the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, the Skywolf tower, and other forces who had a grudge against Lu Ming had extremely ugly expressions and were deeply worried.</p><p>“Uncle Kong is actually this strong?”</p><p>Even Lu Ming and the group were shocked.</p><p>I’ll spare you this time, considering how difficult it was for you to cultivate. If there’s a next time, 1’11 kill you!</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice came out from the walking stick again, and it was filled with killing intent.</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch’s expression was extremely unsightly. There was a hint of fear on his face. At this moment, he gritted his teeth and cupped his fists.”Senior, there’s something I must make clear today!”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“The wind race can forget about the previous matter!”</p><p>The Wind Clan leader said.</p><p>His words moved the hearts of many.</p><p>It was obvious that the wind race had given in. In other words, Feng wuchen’s death today would have been in vain.</p><p>However, everyone could understand. What could they do when a great emperor stood behind Lu Ming? Are you looking for death?</p><p>The other members of the wind race all looked indignant and humiliated. However, even if they were humiliated, they could only endure it.</p><p>“The wind race only has yourselves to blame for this, and you still want to pursue the matter? Continue!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s calm voice rang out.</p><p>“Senior, this time, the Wind Clan can just let it go. However, if Lu Ming kills anyone from the Wind Clan on sight because he has your support, or even kills his way into the wind Clan’s territory, the Wind Clan will definitely retaliate.” if he had a knife and wanted to kill the wind race’s great emperor realm expert, the wind race’s Martial Emperor would not have just stood there and let him kill us. In that case, even if Lu Ming has the support of a senior, the wind race would not hesitate to fight!</p><p>“Senior, even if you can kill me, my Wind Clan will scatter and hide. You won’t be able to kill all of us. My Wind Clan will madly seek revenge. Senior can’t protect these juniors forever!”</p><p>The Wind Clan’s patriarch spoke with a determined tone.</p><p>If Lu Ming wantonly killed the members of the Wind Clan, the Wind Clan would not hesitate to fight.</p><p>Uncle Kong could protect Lu Ming, Lu Xiangxiang, and the others for a while, but could he protect them forever? unless they did not go out.</p><p>The clan leader of the Wind Clan had no other choice. He was really afraid that Lu Ming would kill the People of the Wind Clan unscrupulously because he had the support of a great emperor.</p><p>If that was the case, they would rather fight to the death.</p><p>senior, the Golden Crow Tribe also has the same idea. We can’t be killed passively without retaliating!</p><p>A true Emperor from the Golden Crow race walked out and cupped his fist towards uncle Kong’s walking stick..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
