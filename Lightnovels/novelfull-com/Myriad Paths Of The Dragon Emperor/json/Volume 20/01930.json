It’s the most dangerous kind of fight. Every move is a collision between the great Dao and the power of the world. It’s extremely terrifying. One mistake and you’ll die!</p><p>The voice of a teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy rang out as he explained to the disciples.</p><p>a great emperor expert controls the great Dao of heaven and earth. With every move, the great Dao will be added to the body and the power of the world will follow closely. This is the heavenly Emperor mountain. If it was in the outside world, a casual attack would be able to turn the world upside down and have the power to destroy the world!</p><p>The teacher continued to explain while everyone observed carefully.</p><p>Unfortunately, their cultivation was too low. They hadn’t reached the great emperor realm yet, so it was difficult for them to understand the mysteries of the great emperor realm. They could only watch the show.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the heavenly Emperor mountain, the speed of the two people’s fight became faster and faster. Their expressions also became more and more serious.</p><p>Each time they exchanged blows, a terrifying vibration would burst out. The heavenly Emperor mountain would tremble slightly and the space would shake violently.</p><p>On the heavenly Emperor mountain, a layer of hazy Halo spread out. It was extremely mysterious and locked most of the force inside.</p><p>Soon, the two great emperors exchanged a hundred moves and were evenly matched. Then, they both took out their weapons.</p><p>The Heng clan’s great emperor used a sword while the he clan’s great emperor used a saber.</p><p>Without a doubt, they were both terrifying monarch weapons. The two continued to fight.</p><p>However, the two of them had similar cultivation and combat power. After many moves, they were still unable to determine the winner.</p><p>Just as the two of them were engaged in an intense battle, a figure suddenly appeared at the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>Yes, at the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain, there had only been two great emperors fighting. How could there be an extra figure?</p><p>Clearly, this figure did not appear out of thin air. Instead, he had hidden on the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>As soon as this figure appeared, he launched an attack at the great emperor of the he family. His attack was extremely violent and was no weaker than the two great emperors.</p><p>It was obvious that he was also a great emperor.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. How could a great emperor suddenly appear at the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain?</p><p>“Luo, it’s you. You’re so despicable!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan roared.</p><p>Luo?</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>There was only one emperor surnamed Luo in the yuan mountain Holy Land, and that was the ancient sun Holy Land’s Daluo heaven sect’s Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>This Emperor who had suddenly appeared was probably the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect, the grandfather of Luo cangqiong!</p><p>Apparently, the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect had been hiding at the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain for a long time. They were waiting for the opportunity to join hands with the great emperor of the Heng family to kill the great emperor of the he family.</p><p>“I told you, the one who will die today is you!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s great emperor coldly spoke as his battle sword continued to slash towards the he clan’s great emperor.</p><p>Facing two experts of the same level, the great emperor of the he clan was no match for them and was immediately at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Heng family, you’re despicable!”</p><p>The people of the he family roared in anger. Their faces were extremely ugly and they were extremely worried.</p><p>If the great sovereign of the he family were to die, it would be a disaster for the he family.</p><p>Without a great emperor, they couldn’t fight against the Heng family at all and would be destroyed by the Heng family. The he family, which had been passed down for countless years, would be annihilated.</p><p>“All’s fair in war, you don’t even know this!”</p><p>The experts of the Heng family sneered. They were ecstatic. They hoped that their great emperor could kill the great emperor of the he family. Then, their Heng family would become even more powerful.</p><p>Everyone was looking at the heavenly Emperor mountain nervously. If a great emperor had truly fallen, it would involve a lot of people. It would change the situation of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan tried his best to resist, but he was no match for the two great emperors.</p><p>Not long after, the he family’s great emperor was hit by the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect. His body shook, his face flushed, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Battle Sword of the Heng clan’s great emperor slashed over, but the he clan’s great emperor dodged it by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s great emperor let out a long roar, and his sword technique became faster and faster. The injured great emperor of the he clan found it harder and harder to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>After a few more moves, the he clan’s great emperor finally couldn’t Dodge and was slashed in the chest by the Heng clan’s great emperor. A long sword wound appeared and his entire body was almost cut in half.</p><p>The great Emperor’s blood splattered everywhere and scattered on the peak of the heavenly Emperor mountain.</p><p>The great emperor of the he family roared and wanted to retreat, but his retreat was blocked by the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>He roared, he was unwilling!</p><p>If they were not at the heavenly Emperor mountain, everything of theirs would have been suppressed. If they were outside the heavenly Emperor mountain, even if the two great sovereigns joined hands, they might not be able to stop him. With his strength, he would have no worries in escaping.</p><p>However, this was the heavenly Emperor mountain, it would be different!</p><p>He understood that he had fallen into a trap. Going to the heavenly Emperor mountain to fight with the great emperor of the Heng clan was clearly the other party’s scheme.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>The people of the he clan cried out in sorrow, their hearts trembling with fear.</p><p>Could it be that the great emperor of the he clan was really going to fall here today?</p><p>The Heng family members were ecstatic!</p><p>But at this moment, a change suddenly occurred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the heavenly Emperor mountain started to shake violently. Endless brilliant radiance spread out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Next, a shocking explosion sound emerged from the heavenly Emperor mountain and shattered rocks flew everywhere.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people’s expression changed drastically. Why did such a shocking change suddenly appear at the heavenly Emperor mountain? such a thing had never happened before.</p><p>it’s the blood of the great sovereign, the blood of the great sovereign has been absorbed by the heavenly Emperor mountain!</p><p>Some of the true Emperor realm cultivators shouted. Their eyes were sharp and their spiritual senses were sharp. Even from far away, they could still notice this.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. It was actually because of the great Emperor’s blood.</p><p>However, why would the blood of the great emperor cause such a change to the heavenly Emperor mountain?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, three extremely terrifying auras spread out from the heaven and earth mountain.</p><p>It was the aura of three great emperors!</p><p>Previously, the Qi of the great emperor had been completely suppressed by the heavenly Emperor mountain. Now, the heavenly Emperor mountain seemed to have lost its suppressing effect.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan let out a long howl as a terrifying and boundless power erupted. With a slash of his blade, the vast sky was split open and a spatial crack of unknown length appeared in the sky. The great emperor of the he clan transformed into a blade light and charged into the spatial crack.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>The great emperors from the Heng family and the Daluo heaven sect chased after the great emperor from the he family and rushed into the spatial crack.</p><p>&Nbsp; the void in the spatial Rift immediately exploded with terrifying ripples.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor mountain continued to shake. The radiance grew brighter and brighter. Finally, the radiance condensed into a figure.</p><p>This figure was dressed in a white robe. He looked very young, like a young man in his thirties.</p><p>He was tall, handsome, and had the aura to swallow the world.</p><p>He just stood there as if he was the only one in the world.</p><p>“Heavens … Celestial Emperor, could this be the celestial Emperor?”</p><p>Many people’s voices trembled.</p><p>Si la…</p><p>The spatial crack appeared again and the figure of the Heng clan’s great emperor appeared. His face was somewhat gloomy as he also looked at the heavenly Emperor apparition in the sky above the heavenly Emperor mountain with a surprised expression.</p><p>Then, the great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect also appeared beside him.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>In the distance, spatial fluctuations could be felt as the great emperor of the he family appeared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
