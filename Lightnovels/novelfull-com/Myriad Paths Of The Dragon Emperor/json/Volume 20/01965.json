Lu Ming, you’ve come at the right time. 1’11 finish you off and take back the celestial Thearch sword!</p><p>“That’s right, it really didn’t take much effort to find it after searching high and low!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng family sneered and felt happy.</p><p>This time, the Heng family had two missions in the Lotus World.</p><p>The first was to explore the ruins left behind by the celestial Emperor.</p><p>The second was to kill Lu Ming and retrieve the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>They were looking for Lu Ming, but they did not expect Lu Ming to deliver himself to them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful. They have a very powerful person. Let’s charge out together!”</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Very strong, I’d like to try!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed even more sharply.</p><p>He just so happened to have refined two wisps of chaotic Qi and the chaotic light. His strength had greatly increased, and he wanted to see how strong he was.</p><p>“You guys keep an eye on that little girl who can control the space-time law. Leave Lu Ming to me!”</p><p>A burly Emperor-to-be from the Heng family stepped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The other Emperor-to-be from the Heng family locked onto bubbles to prevent her from helping.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly Emperor-to-be from the Heng family threw a punch at Lu Ming. The moment he punched, the river of laws surrounded his fist, making the power of the punch even more shocking.</p><p>If anyone below Emperor-to-be was hit by this punch, they would be crushed into pieces.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not an ordinary martial artist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch and used the prison-suppressing heavenly art. This punch did not produce the illusion of the prison-suppressing stele. Instead, it contained the power of the prison-suppressing stele in his fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with his opponent’s fist.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, the sound of bones breaking could be heard.</p><p>The fist of the burly Emperor-to-be from the Heng family exploded, and he was forced to retreat by a terrifying force.</p><p>“How can he be this strong?”</p><p>The burly Emperor-to-be of the Heng family roared in disbelief.</p><p>In the punch just now, he felt that Lu Ming’s fist was filled with terrifying power. It was simply indestructible.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and chased after the man. He threw another punch, which caused the space to shake.</p><p>The expression of the burly Emperor-to-be from the Heng family changed and he retreated frantically.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>A skinny middle-aged man from the Heng family’s Emperor-to-be suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming and threw a punch at him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a terrifying vibration. Lu Ming and the other party’s bodies shook at the same time and they took a few steps back.</p><p>an Emperor-to-be with a superior heavenly spiritual body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly, revealing a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Previously, he had encountered people from the Daluo heaven sect and the wind race in the void turbulence. One of them was an Emperor-to-be with a superior-grade heaven spiritual body. He was very powerful and Lu Ming was completely suppressed.</p><p>This thin middle-aged man was also such a figure, and his combat strength was far beyond that of an ordinary Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“If you have some strength, come again!”</p><p>The skinny Emperor-to-be was called Heng Shi. When he was young, he was also a genius of the Heng family. At this moment, he stepped forward with a combat sword in his hand. The sword Qi was like a rainbow as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a monarch weapon!</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Dayan elixir furnace flew out. Lu Ming grabbed one of its legs and swung it at the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a few consecutive explosions, the two of them collided, but it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the Heng family and the Phoenix Palace were shocked. Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the upper tier of the absolute Saint realm, but his combat strength was too shocking. He could actually fight with an Emperor-to-be with a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>Heng Shi was also extremely shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He roared and circulated all his strength to the extreme. His combat sword was like a rainbow, slashing at Lu Ming continuously. Thousands of sword lights broke through the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly as soon as the ray of light was cast. The Dayan elixir furnace was like a giant hammer, constantly smashing at the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After two consecutive moves, Heng Shi’s body trembled and he retreated a few steps.</p><p>“Light of chaos!”</p><p>Eternium roared.</p><p>Once a son of chaos refined the light of chaos, his combat power would increase greatly.</p><p>In the past, among the children of heaven in the yuan mountain, only the Heng Xing River could refine the light of law. Now, Lu Ming had also refined it.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Dayan elixir furnace and launched an extremely violent attack, constantly bombarding his opponent.</p><p>In the process of bombarding, Lu Ming suddenly pointed out a chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Eternium was forced back by the primal Chaos tribulation finger, and it spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Heng Shi suddenly roared and retreated.</p><p>He had already understood that he was not Lu Ming’s match. If they continued to fight, they would be in danger.</p><p>bubble, attack! Attack together!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>toot…</p><p>Bubbles came out of bubbles and covered the five Emperor-to-be from the Heng family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Dayan elixir furnace and smashed it at one of the Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had a crushing advantage over ordinary Emperor-to-be, not to mention that he had bubbles ‘help.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Emperor-to-be was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the two Emperor-to-be from the Phoenix Palace attacked the two Emperor-to-be from the Heng family and injured them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Dayan elixir furnace and smashed it again, killing an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Since Lu Ming’s arrival, three of the six Emperor-to-be from the Heng family had been killed. There were three left.</p><p>One was an eternal stone, and the other two were injured by Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the Eternium burst out with all its power and pierced through the transparent bubble. He did not dare to stop at all. He took a step and his body soared into the sky, rushing to the stone bridge above.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he was about to pursue.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Another terrifying roar came from the bottom of the cave. A terrifying devouring force erupted from below, causing Lu Ming’s expression to change and he stopped his pursuit.</p><p>Heng Shi was overjoyed. The heavens were really helping him!</p><p>After the roar stopped, the Eternium continued to rush up at an amazing speed. In the blink of an eye, it crossed several stone bridges and then turned into a ray of light and flew out of the cave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let us go!”</p><p>A loud roar was heard.</p><p>There were two Emperor-to-be left in the Heng family and they were trapped by the bubble’s spacetime law. One of them shouted.</p><p>“Let you go? how can you be so naive?”</p><p>Even Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the other party actually asked him to let them go.. Was there something wrong with his brain?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
