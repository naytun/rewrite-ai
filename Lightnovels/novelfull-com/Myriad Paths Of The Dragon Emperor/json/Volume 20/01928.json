You secretly sent people to kill my he family members. How do you explain this?”</p><p>He Qian shouted.</p><p>we didn’t send anyone to kill the people of the he family!</p><p>An expert from the Heng clan spoke.</p><p>Bullsh * t! You used the laws of eternal spring to kill the people of the he family. Do you think we’re blind? ”</p><p>An expert of the he clan shouted.</p><p>what a joke. He Qian took my tribulation-transcending clothes, and we didn’t even go to his house. Your he family only lost a few useless pieces of trash, and you came to my Heng family. Do you want to start a war? ”</p><p>An expert from the Heng clan coldly spoke.</p><p>The he clan and the Heng clan had always been mortal enemies. Although they had eased up a little in recent years, these Martial Emperor powerhouses had lived for a long time and had fought with each other countless times. Their enmity was not that easy to resolve.</p><p>Every time they met, it was always with swords drawn and bows bent.</p><p>good, very good. You killed members of the he family. Do you think we’re easy to bully? unless you don’t go out in the future, hehe!</p><p>He Qian sneered. In other words, if the Heng family could kill the he family, the he family could also kill the Heng family.</p><p>“He Qian, then I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor from the Heng clan had a very strong killing intent. He Qian had taken one of their divine tribulation-transcending clothes, so he wanted to kill he Qian immediately and take it back.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew over at high speed and arrived beside the Heng family expert.</p><p>true Emperor, it’s not good. The he family has been secretly hunting the experts of my Heng family. Two great saints and one absolute Saint have been killed by the he family!</p><p>The man reported.</p><p>“What? You should die!”</p><p>When the Heng family’s true Emperor expert heard this, he was instantly enraged.</p><p>On the surface, the he family had come to denounce their crimes, but they had secretly sent people to kill the Heng family members. They were despicable and shameless.</p><p>nonsense! We didn’t send anyone to kill your Heng family!</p><p>An old man from the he family said with a frown.</p><p>“You’re obviously using the law of the Four Seasons, yet you dare to say that you’re not a member of the he family!”</p><p>The person who came to report the news shouted.</p><p>The he family inherited the law of the Four Seasons, which was similar to the eternal spring Law of the Heng family. In the distant past, the he family was even known as the descendants of the celestial Emperor, which was why they were mortal enemies with the Heng family.</p><p>“Damn it, you took the Heng family’s divine tribulation robe and now you’re sending people to kill my Heng family members. Today, all of you can stay!”</p><p>One of the Heng clan’s true emperors was furious. He activated his World Energy and a terrifying sword light shot towards the he clan’s true Emperor.</p><p>“If you want to start a war, don’t think that the he family will be afraid of you!”</p><p>The true Emperor of the he clan was also furious and launched a counterattack.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>The other experts of the Heng family also made their moves. Terrifying sword-lights burst out and attacked the experts of the he family.</p><p>However, the he clan’s experts were all at the true Emperor level, so they also launched their counterattacks.</p><p>The entire area was blown up. The terrifying force was rampant. The entire heavenly Emperor City seemed to be shaking.</p><p>The chaotic battle of true emperors was too terrifying. Countless people were alarmed and flew up to watch.</p><p>heavens, a battle between true emperors! That’s the experts of the Heng and he families!</p><p>are the two families going to have another war after a thousand years?”</p><p>In the distance, many people watched in fear.</p><p>In the distant sky, Lu Ming transformed into a dark-skinned young man and watched from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>In fact, his plan wasn’t very brilliant. He used the chaos laws to split up the Heng family and the he family and kill the other side’s people to trigger a conflict between the two sides.</p><p>As long as the two families calmed down and discussed this plan, it would not be difficult for them to see through it. They might even suspect Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the enmity between the two families was deep to begin with. It was like gunpowder that would ignite at the slightest spark.</p><p>Moreover, there was also he Qian’s matter, so it was impossible for the two families to sit down and get along. After a few words, they really started fighting.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Terrifying sword and saber lights filled the entire sky. The space cracked open, revealing a terrifying pitch-black space.</p><p>However, this was the Heng family.</p><p>As soon as they started, powerful auras were released in the Heng family. Some terrifying experts woke up from their seclusion and joined the battle.</p><p>The he family’s true Emperor expert was instantly at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Rush out and return to the he family!”</p><p>A true Emperor from the he clan roared. There were five true emperors from the he clan who came. The five of them joined forces and attacked madly.</p><p>However, there were more and more true emperors from the Heng family. They were at a complete disadvantage and couldn’t charge out at all.</p><p>attack the rest of the Heng family!</p><p>He Qian’s eyes revealed a malevolent look as he slashed out a blade light. It wasn’t aimed at the other true emperors, but at the Heng family’s palaces and those below the true Emperor realm.</p><p>“Not good, despicable!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s true emperors roared in anger. Two of them rushed out to help, but it was too late.</p><p>He Qian’s blade light was hundreds of miles long. As it fell, countless Heng family members were turned into ashes. A hundreds of miles long crack appeared in the palace of the Heng family and continued to extend forward.</p><p>“He Xiao, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s true emperors were enraged, and some of them charged towards he Qian.</p><p>However, he Qian’s face was filled with ferocity as he slashed at the other members of the Heng family. The few true emperors had no choice but to block he Qian’s Saber Light.</p><p>Normally, when true emperors fought, they wouldn’t attack the weak.</p><p>However, he Qian’s great Tribulation was approaching. This time, he did not have much confidence, so he acted extremely crazily and did not follow any rules.</p><p>When the Heng clan’s true emperors went to rescue the others, an opening appeared in the encirclement. He Qian and the other five true emperors from the he clan broke out of the encirclement and rushed towards the he clan.</p><p>“He family, you must pay with your blood!”</p><p>The Heng family’s true Emperor let out an angry roar.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming sneered. His figure flashed and he headed towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Next, he didn’t need to do anything. He just had to watch.</p><p>A war would definitely break out between the Heng family and the he family.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy, in the heavenly Emperor Alliance, Xing Chen wielded his combat sword and charged towards the divine fire Alliance. In the divine fire Alliance, he killed the he family’s number one prodigy, a powerful King body.</p><p>This matter shook the entire Yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>The he clan elite was in the top ten of the Saint King ranking. He was terrifyingly talented and was the second in command of the divine fire Alliance. However, he had been killed just like that.</p><p>No one in the divine fire Alliance dared to stop the eternal Star River!</p><p>After hearing this news, the he family was in an uproar.</p><p>He was the number one heaven’s favorite of the he family, with a powerful King body and unparalleled talent. He was regarded as the future hope of the he family and a figure who had the potential to break through to the great sovereign realm. But now, he was killed by the star River just like that.</p><p>“Start the battle!”</p><p>An angry voice came from the he family.</p><p>“Start the battle!”</p><p>It was the same in the Heng family.</p><p>On this day, the Heng clan and the he clan both sent out terrifying experts. They met in the central area of the two clans. There was nothing to say, and a terrifying battle immediately broke out between the two clans..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
