Be careful that you won’t be able to use it even if you have the life to take it!</p><p>One of the Heng clan’s true emperors shouted and his powerful aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>if you can’t capture Lu Ming, you have no right to take the Heng family’s divine robe for tribulation transcendence. Hand it over!</p><p>The Heng clan’s white-haired true Emperor shouted coldly, and the divine light of the world bloomed from his body. If he Qian didn’t hand over the divine tribulation-transcending robe, he would attack at any moment.</p><p>The divine clothing for tribulation transcendence was extremely precious. It could only be encountered by chance and not sought after. Moreover, it was a one-time use. After transcending the heavenly Tribulation once, it would be useless the next time.</p><p>Initially, it was worth it to take down Lu Ming and obtain the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had not been taken down and the celestial Thearch’s sword had not been obtained. How could they be willing to let it be regarded as a piece of divine clothing for tribulation transcendence for no reason?</p><p>He Qian’s expression was unsightly. He was truly unwilling to hand over the treasure that he had obtained.</p><p>alright, 1’11 return it to you. But 1 provided the information after all, so you should at least compensate me!</p><p>He Gao said coldly.</p><p>“Compensation? What do you want?”</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor of the Heng clan asked.</p><p>“A true Emperor weapon!” He Qian spoke.</p><p>“A true Emperor weapon?”</p><p>The two true emperors of the Heng clan looked at each other and nodded.</p><p>“Alright, we agree to your request!”</p><p>The Heng clan’s white-haired true Emperor said with a nod. Although true Emperor weapons were precious, they were still far inferior to the Tribulation transcending divine clothes.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll give you the divine clothing for tribulation transcendence!”</p><p>He Qian revealed an expression of ‘heartache1. He took out a storage ring and threw it to the Heng clan’s white-haired true Emperor.</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor of the Heng clan waved his hand and grabbed the storage ring.</p><p>At this time, he Qian’s eyes revealed a ruthless look as he muttered,” “Explode!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The storage ring exploded, and the destructive power sent the white-haired true Emperor of the Heng family flying.</p><p>This way, there was a gap in the encirclement of the two true emperors of the Heng family.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>He Qian seized the opportunity and flew out like a bolt of lightning, fleeing in the direction of the he clan.</p><p>“Damn it, he Qian, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The Heng family’s white-haired true Emperor let out a heaven-shaking roar.</p><p>“What can you do to me if I hide in the he family?”</p><p>He Qian sneered, his voice coming from afar.</p><p>Now, his Heavenly Tribulation was more important. There were less than 100 years left. At most, he would hide in the he family for the next 100 years.</p><p>A hundred years was just a blink of an eye to him.</p><p>The he family was as famous as the Heng family. As long as he hid in the he family and didn’t come out, the Heng family couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>He flew toward the he family like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>he Qian, how dare you covet the Heng family’s treasure? your he family will pay the price!</p><p>Behind him, the other true Emperor from the Heng family roared and chased after he Qian. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, a figure flashed and Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen everything that had happened to the three true emperors earlier.</p><p>it looks like he Qian tipped the Heng family off and used my information to exchange for the Heng family’s treasure. Now they’re in a mess. Very well, he family, Heng family, just you wait. I’ll make you pay soon!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He took a step forward and his figure disappeared.</p><p>In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, a new tomb appeared on a mountain peak rich with original Qi. Lu Ming, Xiangxiang Beila, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin were kowtowing in front of the tomb of the Ice Dragon Valley master. Behind him, the other members of the Dragon Alliance also bowed!</p><p>After a long time, Lu Ming stood up. He took out a pot of wine and poured it in front of the tomb of the Ice Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Then, with a single thought, a figure appeared out of thin air in front of the tomb of the Ice Dragon Valley master.</p><p>This person was the one who was brought out of the he family by Lu Ming. He was also a member of he Hao’s mansion.</p><p>Valley master, today, I will offer the blood of this person from the he family to you. In the future, I will personally take off he Qian’s dog head and come to offer it to you!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming raised his knife and cut off the man’s head.</p><p>Valley master, I’ll make the he and Heng families pay some interest soon!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, he turned around and left the place.</p><p>It was useless to be overly sad. Lu Ming would use his actions to make the he family regret.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s residence, he took out the stone of chaos and studied it carefully.</p><p>“I’ve lost the chaotic original Qi as expected. What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a look.</p><p>He injected his Saint energy and chaos laws into it, but there was no reaction.</p><p>There was no chaos Qi in the chaos gem at all.</p><p>However, a chaos gem was still a chaos gem. Even without chaos Qi, it could still be used as the main material to craft monarch weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming used his holy weapon to attack the rock of chaos, but he could not even leave a mark on it.</p><p>Lu Ming refined it. At a critical moment, it might be used as a defensive treasure to resist the enemy’s attack.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming closed his eyes and adjusted his breathing. Three days later, Lu Ming was back to his peak state. He then used the divine breath technique to change his appearance and left the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>Outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy, there were still experts from the Heng family standing guard. When they saw Lu Ming coming out, they scanned him with their spiritual senses but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered away.</p><p>Lu Ming had come out for nothing but revenge.</p><p>He didn’t have the power to fight the he and Heng families yet, but he could collect some interest first.</p><p>Lu Ming’s first stop was Vientiane tower.</p><p>Firstly, Lu Ming bought all the information about the Heng family and the he family at Vientiane tower. He even bought the information of some important figures in the two families.</p><p>Of course, it cost a lot of money.</p><p>After Lu Ming took away the information of the important figures of the two families, he began to study it in detail.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming went to Vientiane tower again to inquire about some people from the Heng family and he family.</p><p>Drunken immortal restaurant, one of the three buildings in heavenly Emperor City, was extremely famous.</p><p>That was because the beauties in the drunken immortal restaurant were the most famous in the heavenly Emperor City. Of course, there was also good wine that could make Immortals drunk and dream of death.</p><p>Therefore, this place had become the gathering place for the young geniuses of many forces in heavenly Emperor City. Not only the young geniuses, but even the older generation would come.</p><p>He Yutang was one of the top heaven’s favorites in the younger generation of the he family. He was placed in an important position in the he family at a young age. Although he did not have a King physique, he was a heaven’s favorite second only to the king physique.</p><p>Now, his cultivation had reached the great saint perfection realm.</p><p>However, he had been very depressed during this period of time.</p><p>He was also cultivating in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. However, the Supreme talents of the he family didn’t have much achievements. They were suppressed in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Out of the four sets of array disks, the he family didn’t get a single one. In the end, they could only choose to join the divine fire Alliance.</p><p>Therefore, he was very unhappy. In his spare time, he would run out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, return to the he clan, or go to the drunken immortal restaurant to relax.</p><p>In drunken immortal restaurant, there was a mirror-like Lake. On the lake, there were sailboats floating, and on the lakeshore, there were many pavilions.</p><p>He Yutang was lying in a Pavilion with two beautiful girls. One was massaging his shoulders and the other was lying in his arms.</p><p>She was soft and fragrant. He closed his eyes and quietly enjoyed it.</p><p>“He Yutang, get out here!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar broke the silence..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
