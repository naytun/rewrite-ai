She looked at Lu Ming and suddenly smiled, young master is so young, but you have such cultivation. 1 really admire you.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>Yan kui and his son committed treason and killed the king. Fortunately, young master killed them to avenge the king. With young master’s cultivation, it is enough to rule mingyan country. I am willing to help young master ascend to the throne and serve you with all my heart!</p><p>Consort Qing’s voice was melodious. Her alluring body wriggled like a water snake as she was about to pounce into Lu Ming’s arms. At the same time, she looked into Lu Ming’s eyes with a strange glint.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself by casting a bewitching technique on me!”</p><p>I’m sorry,” Lu Ming said calmly. When he finished the last word, his eyes shone like stars.</p><p>Consort Qing let out a blood-curdling screech as her body was sent flying. She fell to the ground and vomited a large mouthful of blood. Her face was deathly pale, and she looked desperate.</p><p>Her cultivation had also been crippled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. This woman had actually used a bewitching technique on him. She was overestimating herself. Lu Ming had only circulated some of his energy and she had suffered a backlash, crippling her cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and stood above the state preceptor. He looked down at the state preceptor and said indifferently,”Your scheme is not bad, but unfortunately, you are too weak. What’s the use of all your schemes?”</p><p>“The heavens are not protecting me!”</p><p>The Imperial advisor shouted. His voice was exhausted, and his eyes were filled with unwillingness and despair.</p><p>He had racked his brains to set up this trap. It was originally flawless, and ruan tianjiao had no chance of turning the tables.</p><p>In the future, Ming Yan country would definitely fall into his hands.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would come out of nowhere and destroy all his plans with absolute power.</p><p>In the face of absolute power, all schemes were laughable.</p><p>He finally understood why Lu Ming had been drinking his wine calmly and not saying a word when they were following the plan step by step.</p><p>They were looking at them as if they were clowns.</p><p>Lu Ming would let them play around. When they thought that the overall situation was set, he would take action and easily destroy all their plans, efforts, and setups.</p><p>He could only blame the heavens for not protecting him. Why did a person like Lu Ming appear?</p><p>“Who are you? Is there no one like you in the vast sea nine nations?”</p><p>The Imperial advisor shouted unwillingly.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to know who I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Lu Ming then looked at ruan tianjiao and said,” “Sky flood Dragon, what’s the next step?”</p><p>At this moment, ruan tianjiao seemed to wake up from a dream. The shock that Lu Ming gave her was too strong.</p><p>She was shocked that a great saint could not put up any resistance in Lu Ming’s hands. He could kill them with a flip of his hand.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao coldly spoke. Since things had already come to this, there was no way out.</p><p>After making her decision, ruan tianjiao transformed into an iron-blooded general. She stepped forward and her sword light burst forth, killing the Imperial advisor, Yan Song, and Consort Qing. There were even some members of the imperial family who were killed by her.</p><p>At random, ruan tianjiao transformed into a god of death and secretly killed his way into the depths of the Imperial Palace, killing all the upper echelons of the imperial family.</p><p>Since he had already come this far, ruan tianjiao understood that there was no way out.</p><p>After that, ruan tianjiao took the body of the unparalleled Sword Saint of the Luoshui Kingdom and stood on the City Tower of barren city. He announced to the world that the Imperial advisor had rebelled and colluded with the four great marshals and Consort Qing to kill the monarch and the core members of the royal family in an attempt to usurp the throne.</p><p>Later on, ruan tianjiao arrived and killed the Imperial advisor as well as a group of rebels. Unfortunately, it was already too late to reverse the situation.</p><p>Once the news was out, the world was shocked.</p><p>After a few days, the entire Divine Dragon Army killed their way to the capital and took control of it.</p><p>However, the armies of the other four marshals also announced to the world that everything was ruan tianjiao’s scheme. It was ruan tianjiao who had killed the Imperial advisor and the king with the intention of usurping the throne. He had also led the Army to attack the divine Dragon Army in the name of avenging the king.</p><p>However, the four great army Corps had lost a powerhouse at the level of a Marshal, so their cohesion was greatly weakened.</p><p>Furthermore, the divine Dragon Army had cultivated the true dragon battle formation, so their combat power was strong. They easily defeated the four major armies and subdued them. At this point, the entire Ming Yan country was under ruan tianjiao’s control.</p><p>A few days later, the divine flood Dragon military headquarters used the reason that the country could not go a day without a ruler to invite ruan tianjiao to ascend the throne. However, ruan tianjiao rejected them.</p><p>After a few more days, the generals tried to persuade him again, but he was still rejected by ruan tianjiao.</p><p>The third time, it was not just the generals, but also countless people who came to petition for ruan tianjiao to take the throne and rule Ming Yan country.</p><p>In the past, when the Imperial advisor of Ming Yan country was in power, his reputation was ruined. Now that the Imperial advisor had been killed, the people were all celebrating.</p><p>As for ruan tianjiao, she had always had the title of the goddess of war and was deeply loved by the people. The people naturally hoped that ruan tianjiao would take control of Ming Yan country.</p><p>Only then did ruan tianjiao agree to inherit the throne and become Empress.</p><p>Ming Yan country was extremely lively as they began to prepare for the Ascension ceremony.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not interfere in these matters. To the mingyan country, he was just a passer-by who would leave very soon. Now, he only had to wait for the nine nations ‘Alliance before heading to the divine time Island to explore the divine time mountain.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been cultivating quietly.</p><p>But not long after, a piece of news came.</p><p>The Luoshui Kingdom mobilized their Army and rode the cross-sea warship to attack the mingyan Kingdom.</p><p>The entire mingyan country was shocked. The power of the Luoshui country had always been above that of the mingyan country. They had always wanted to swallow up the mingyan country. In recent years, the two countries had been at war.</p><p>Ruan tianjiao immediately ordered the Army to attack the Luoshui Kingdom.</p><p>Lu Ming also set off with the Army.</p><p>When they arrived at the northern part of mingyan country, they saw a few huge warships flying over. In front of the warships was a dense Army riding all kinds of strange beasts. The Army was very powerful.</p><p>our country, Luoshui, has been on good terms with the country of mingyan for generations. It is unforgivable for traitors and traitors to usurp the throne. Today, the country of Luoshui has come to seek revenge from the king of mingyan!</p><p>A voice came from the Luoshui Kingdom’s Army.</p><p>“How shameless!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao shook his head.</p><p>The Luoshui Kingdom and the mingyan Kingdom had been at war for a long time. The Luoshui Kingdom had been trying to invade the mingyan Kingdom. Now, in the mouth of the people of the Luoshui Kingdom, it had become a good relationship between the two countries.</p><p>if you want to find a reason to attack our country, you should find a better one. This reason is really laughable!</p><p>Ruan tianjiao’s voice rang out.</p><p>traitors, you still think you’re in the right? today is the day you die. Kill!</p><p>The commander of the Luoshui Kingdom ordered the Army to form a battle formation and charge toward the mingyan Kingdom.</p><p>“Set up the formation and kill the enemy!”</p><p>Ruan tianjiao gave the order, and the divine Dragon Army set up a large formation. Immediately, a true dragon appeared and roared towards the sky with an astonishing aura.</p><p>“Such a large formation …”</p><p>The commander of the Luoshui Kingdom was shocked.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The armies of the two countries clashed together.</p><p>Although the divine Dragon Army had fewer people, the true dragon battle formation was too powerful. When the two armies collided, the true dragon roared and clawed down, tearing a hole in the enemy battle formation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
