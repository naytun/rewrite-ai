He accelerated to his maximum speed and rushed towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>He wanted to use the fastest speed to return to the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>On the other side, he Qian brought the two true emperors from the Heng clan to the he clan and arrived outside Lu Xiangxiang’s residence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll leave it to you. It’s not convenient for me to go in. You can’t touch the little girl inside. As for the others, you can do as you please!1‘</p><p>He Qian warned.</p><p>The two true emperors from the Heng clan nodded and stepped out. They arrived in the air above Xiangxiang Bella’s courtyard and scanned the area with their spiritual senses.</p><p>With a single glance, their faces darkened and a hint of anger flashed in their eyes.</p><p>The two of them moved and arrived in front of he Gao, their eyes burning with anger.</p><p>“He Xiao, you dare to play with us?1‘</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“Playing with you? why do you say that?’1</p><p>He Xiao’s face darkened as he said this. He did not know why, but he suddenly had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>“There’s no one in the courtyard. Are you playing with us?”</p><p>The expression of the other true Emperor from the Heng family became even uglier.</p><p>He Qian’s expression changed drastically, there’s no one here. How is that possible? ” he Qian said.</p><p>After saying that, he rushed into the courtyard like a gust of wind and swept out his spiritual sense violently.</p><p>There was no one. The courtyard was empty.</p><p>“Damn it, where are they?”</p><p>He Qian bellowed in rage. His spiritual consciousness spread out to the other residences of the he family like a storm. However, he did not find Lu Ming and the rest anywhere it passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, two figures flew out and landed in front of he Hao. They were the experts that He Yan had used to secretly monitor Xiangxiang and the others.</p><p>“Where are they? Where are the people in the courtyard?”</p><p>He Qian roared in rage. His face was twisted in anger.</p><p>“People … Weren’t they in the courtyard? we didn’t see them come out. Could it be … It’s an estate-world treasure!”</p><p>The two of them thought of something, and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“You two idiots!”</p><p>He Qian rebuked angrily, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent. He said in a low voice, ” the art of disguise. Lu Ming is proficient in the art of disguise. I didn’t expect this kid to be so meticulous. I was too careless!</p><p>Although he knew that Lu Ming was proficient in the art of disguise, he had thought that Lu Ming would at least stay at the he family for a day. He had already rushed over to look for the Heng family. As long as Lu Ming stayed any longer, he would not be able to escape.</p><p>He did not expect that as soon as he left, Lu Ming brought Xiangxiang Bella and the rest and left the he family.</p><p>He knew that he had miscalculated.</p><p>“He Xiao, what tricks are you playing? If you want to lie to us, hand over the divine tribulation robe!”</p><p>The two true emperors from the Heng clan appeared on either side of he Qian with dark expressions. Their powerful auras enveloped he Qian.</p><p>“You two, this is the he family!”</p><p>He Qian said coldly.</p><p>The expressions of the two true emperors from the Heng clan changed.</p><p>That’s right, this was the he family. If he made a move against he Qian, he would definitely be attacked by the experts of the he family. At that time, they would all be in danger.</p><p>he Qian, the Heng family’s tribulation-transcending outfit isn’t that easy to trick. If you don’t return it, you’ll have to wait for the Heng family’s revenge unless you hide in the he family forever!</p><p>The white-haired true Emperor of the Heng family said coldly, and the aura around him became even stronger.</p><p>“What are you guys so anxious about? No matter where that little b * stard Lu Ming is hiding, I will be able to find him!”</p><p>He Qian sneered. Then, he began to form a magical seal with both hands. This was the seal to control the soul devouring insects. No matter how far away they were, as long as he formed the seal, he could control the soul devouring insects and sense Lu Ming’s location through them.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength and flew towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The he clan wasn’t too far away from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. He was rapidly approaching the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He sensed that something was happening in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram. Part of his mind controlled the mountain and river diagram and continued to fly towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered, he saw the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley holding his head with his hands and roaring like a wild beast. His face was full of pain.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the Ice Dragon Valley master’s head heavily smashed into the mountain, causing it to shake and sending debris flying.</p><p>“Grandpa Valley master, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila stood at the side, not knowing what to do, her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>“Poisoned, Valley master must have been poisoned. Damn it, that he Qian is so vicious!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; just now, Ice Dragon Valley master had already explained the matter to them, so they understood the cause and effect.</p><p>He Qian let Xiangxiang cultivate the Four Seasons technique because he wanted to use Xiangxiang’s primordial Yin to improve himself. How vicious.</p><p>The two of them felt a wave of fear after hearing that.</p><p>“Valley master, what poison did you get?”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the side of Ice Dragon Valley master and asked.</p><p>“It’s the soul devouring insects. He Qian has already returned to the he family and knows that we have escaped. This is bad. He can determine our location through the soul devouring insects. Lu Ming, kill me, kill me!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Tian Chui, Xiangxiang Beila, and Lu Ming’s faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>quickly kill me! Otherwise, he Qian will catch up with me very soon!</p><p>you’re courting death! Ice Dragon Valley master roared. His originally gentle face was now twisted in pain. His head slammed heavily on the mountain peak once more, creating a huge pit.</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master’s face was covered in blood, his white hair scattered. Even with his status as the valley master and his absolute Saint realm cultivation, he still found it difficult to endure. It was clear how terrifying he was.</p><p>The hearts of Lu Ming and the other two started to tremble.</p><p>“He Qian, I will definitely kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His eyes were filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>“Hurry up and do it!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>“Valley master … Grandpa Valley master, we can’t, we can’t do it!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila shook her head repeatedly.</p><p>How was it possible for them to kill the Ice Dragon Valley master?</p><p>Valley master , we will reach the yuan mountain sacred Academy soon. After we reach the yuan mountain sacred Academy, 1 will think of a way to ask the Emperor to help you take out the soul devouring insects!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>it’s too late. He Qian will catch up with us very soon. By then, none of us will be able to escape. I’m old, and my cultivation has reached its limit. 1 have no hope of breaking through in the future, but you can’t die. You have a bright future. Dragon God Valley will depend on you in the future. Hurry up and do it!</p><p>&Nbsp;” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>“No, you can’t!”</p><p>The three of them shook their heads firmly.</p><p>“If you guys aren’t going to do it, then I’ll do it myself!”</p><p>die! Ice Dragon Valley master roared. The Saint energy in his body surged crazily, then rushed to his head.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xiangxiang Bella’s faces changed drastically.</p><p>However, it was too late for him to stop it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; a boom exploded in Ice Dragon Valley master’s mind, and then he stood there in a daze.</p><p>“Valley master!”</p><p>“Grandpa Valley master!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two turned pale with fright and rushed to the side of Ice Dragon Valley master.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, Ice Dragon Valley master was no longer breathing.</p><p>He had died and destroyed his own soul to avoid being located by he Qian..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
