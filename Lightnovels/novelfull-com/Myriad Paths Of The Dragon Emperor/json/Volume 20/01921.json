Very quickly, the price of the chaos gem was raised to 500000 superior-grade raw stones.</p><p>However, at this price, the number of people bidding decreased.</p><p>After all, this chaos gem no longer had any chaos Qi and could only be considered a smithing material. Although it could be used to forge monarch weapons, there was still a chance of success. If it failed, the material would be wasted.</p><p>As such, unless it was a complete sovereign weapon, the materials would not be as expensive as they were.</p><p>Soon, the price reached around eight hundred thousand raw gemstones, and almost no one else raised the bid.</p><p>eight hundred thousand raw stones. Is there anyone else who wants to bid? ”</p><p>The old man in charge asked, his voice reverberating throughout the auction house.</p><p>“One million!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his mouth and called out a high price of one million.</p><p>Previously, he had not made a bid because he wanted to wait for the auction to start so that he could win it in one fell swoop.</p><p>The host’s eyes lit up. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”This young master has bid one million superior-grade raw stones. Are there any higher bids?”</p><p>After that, the old man asked three times, but no one made a bid.</p><p>One million superior-grade raw stones was already on the high side for a chaotic stone without any chaotic Qi. Naturally, no one made a bid.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming bought the raw gemstone at the price of one million.</p><p>A young and beautiful lady came to Lu Ming with the stone of chaos.</p><p>young master, this is a rock of chaos!</p><p>The young woman said, meaning that they would hand over the money and the goods at the same time.</p><p>“May 1 ask if I can use my monarch weapon to pay?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>The young woman smiled.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. A pair of tiny wings appeared in his palm. Then, the wings slowly grew larger and exuded a strong Emperor aura.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained this pair of wings from the Golden Crow Crown Prince when he killed him.</p><p>“This is … A monarch weapon!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“I didn’t expect this young man to have a monarch weapon.”</p><p>Some people’s eyes flashed with greed.</p><p>he’s so young and he already has a monarch weapon. He must be a heaven’s chosen from the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Someone else said. These words caused the hearts of those who had previously been greedy to tremble, and they dispelled their greed.</p><p>Almost all of the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy came from powerful forces. If one wanted to lay their hands on these people, they might not even be able to survive.</p><p>of course, you can use your monarch weapon to offset the price. You can auction your monarch weapon directly and the extra raw gemstones will be given to you on the spot!</p><p>The young woman said with a smile.</p><p>“Then let’s do this!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and handed the monarch weapon to the young lady. The young lady then passed the storage ring with the chaos gems to Lu Ming.</p><p>Right after that, the auction started with Lu Ming’s sovereign weapon.</p><p>In the end, the sovereign weapon was sold for five million high-grade raw stones. After deducting the one million stones of chaos and the handling fee, Lu Ming was left with nearly four million high-grade raw stones.</p><p>The bidding continued. The further it went, the more precious the treasures were. Even true emperors and martial emperors had joined the bidding for the last few treasures. The prices had reached a jaw-dropping level, which was an eye-opener for Lu Ming.</p><p>Compared to those martial sovereigns and even true sovereigns, his wealth was simply a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Finally, with the success of the last treasure, the auction came to an end.</p><p>After the auction ended, Lu Ming left the auction house in advance and waited outside.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From the auction house, many figures flew out and flew in all directions of heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw an old man flying out of the auction house with a young girl.</p><p>“Fragrance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Although the young lady had grown up and was much taller, Lu Ming could tell at a glance that she was his disciple, Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly chased after him.</p><p>Fortunately, He Yan did not go too fast. He seemed to have the intention of bringing Xiangxiang Bella around to tour the heavenly Emperor City. Therefore, Lu Ming could still keep up.</p><p>After following them for a while, they flew for a long distance. In front of them, he Xiao and Lu Xiangxiang suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Little fellow, you followed me all the way here from the auction house. What is it for?”</p><p>He Qian spoke coldly, and a powerful aura burst forth.</p><p>This aura was earth-shattering and heaven-shaking, causing Lu Ming’s body to shake violently. He retreated a thousand meters at an extreme speed and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This was also because the other party had shown mercy. Otherwise, he would have died with just one breath.</p><p>“Senior, you’ve misunderstood. I’m here to look for Xiangxiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly spoke, using his original voice.</p><p>Hearing Lu Ming’s voice, Xiangxiang Bella’s delicate body trembled. She revealed an extremely surprised look and shouted,” “Master, you … Are you my master?”</p><p>“What?” He Qian was slightly stunned. A cold killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes, but it disappeared in a flash and was not revealed.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, it’s me. However, it’s not convenient for me to reveal my true body now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xiangxiang Bella. He was not familiar with he Qian, so he naturally kept his guard up.</p><p>“Master, it’s really you!”</p><p>With a Swoosh, she pounced on Lu Ming and plunged into his arms.</p><p>“Master, where did you go? Xiang Xiang misses you so much!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Wan swallowed, tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>“Silly girl, aren’t we reunited now? That’s right, Valley master, where’s senior brother Tian Chui?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“They’re at the he family?”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella said.</p><p>“The he family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. There was a he family in the heavenly Emperor City that was as famous as the Heng family. Lu Ming had naturally heard of them.</p><p>Could it be this he family?</p><p>“Haha, Xiangxiang, this little brother is the master you’ve always mentioned?”</p><p>At this moment, he Xiao smiled and walked over.</p><p>“En, that’s right. He is my master. Master, this is senior he Qian, the true Emperor expert of the he clan.”</p><p>Xiangxiang Bella introduced them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Greetings, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted he Qian.</p><p>young heroes indeed come from young people. Little brother, Xiangxiang has missed you a lot during this period of time. How about this? it’s rare for us to meet, so let’s go to the he family first. How about it?”</p><p>He Qian said with a smile, showing his good will.</p><p>“En, master, let’s go together. Grandpa Valley master and uncle Tian Chui will definitely be very happy to see you!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang pulled on Lu Ming’s arm, a bright smile on her face.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Together with Xiangxiang Bella, they followed he Qian and headed to the he family.</p><p>When they arrived at the he family, Tian Chui and ice Dragon Valley master were stunned when they saw Lu Ming. However, they were overjoyed when they heard Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>The few of them gathered together and chatted for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming learned that when Ice Dragon Valley master, Tian Chui, and Xiangxiang Bella were separated from Xue ningxin, they happened to meet he Qian and were brought back to the he family by he Qian.</p><p>When Tian Chui and ice Dragon Valley master knew that Xue ningxin was fine, they were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have something to discuss with you!”</p><p>At this time, he Xiao opened his mouth and said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
