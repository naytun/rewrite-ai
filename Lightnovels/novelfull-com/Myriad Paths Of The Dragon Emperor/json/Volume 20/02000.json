Countless experts charged towards heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Those below the rank of martial Supreme would attack from below, while those above would attack from above.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying rumbles came from all directions of heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>A great battle had erupted. The entire region seemed to be on the verge of exploding. The sky was torn apart as if it was the end of the world. It was boundlessly terrifying.</p><p>Fortunately, the heavenly Emperor City was built by the heavenly Emperor in the past and was sturdy and immortal. Even such an intense battle would not be able to destroy the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Lu Ming, uncle Kong, and the rest stood high in the sky and watched from afar.</p><p>“Well make the first move!”</p><p>Wu Xiang Emperor said. Then, the five great emperors turned into five streaks of light and rushed into heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the heavenly Emperor City, a wild roar came out, and a terrifying light burst out, killing towards Emperor Wu Xiang and the others.</p><p>The battle between the great emperors broke out, and they fought their way to the endless high sky of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Great emperors were too terrifying. If they fought below, the others would be affected and die in the aftermath of the battle.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense. Even though they were far away, the wind was still howling and sweeping over.</p><p>“Hall Master, let’s go!”</p><p>With a wave of uncle Kong’s hand, a wave of energy enveloped Lu Ming. Then, he tore apart the void. In the next moment, he had already arrived inside the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>This was the place where the heavenly Emperor mountain used to be.</p><p>There was a huge cave below, and from afar, one could see a huge black Vortex.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s figure moved once more, and they directly charged into the cave.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Within the pitch-black Vortex, there was a gigantic evil god race being. Its body was incomparably huge, and ordinary people were like ants in comparison.</p><p>This gigantic evil god tribe being stretched out its two palms and held the two sides of the vortex.</p><p>From time to time, some of the evil god tribe members would rush out of the vortex.</p><p>There was a figure sitting cross-legged on the edge of the whirlpool.</p><p>At this moment, the figure’s gaze was like a divine sword as he looked at uncle Kong and Lu Ming.</p><p>“You want to take the void passage? kill!”</p><p>This person shouted loudly and exploded with a terrifying aura. If Lu Ming had not been enveloped by uncle Kong’s power, he would have been shaken to death by the sound.</p><p>This person was also a great emperor realm expert, and he was in charge of the spatial passage.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Uncle Kong muttered. At this moment, uncle Kong’s hunched back became straight and his turbid eyes became bright like two stars. Terrifying sword Qi shot into the sky and shook the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of sword light sliced through the heavens and headed straight for the evil god race’s Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two attacks collided, and the underground cave shook violently. The void was torn apart, leaving many hideous holes.</p><p>Some of the evil god tribe members who had just rushed out of the vortex were turned into ashes by the shockwaves.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The long sword in uncle Kong’s hand trembled continuously, and the sword howls were endless. In an instant, he had slashed out hundreds and thousands of times.</p><p>Each sword could kill a peak true Emperor expert.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s great emperor howled in anger and unleashed his full power to fight against uncle Kong. However, at this moment, the other party was being suppressed.</p><p>“Hall Master, now is the time!”</p><p>Uncle Kong sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos stone plate!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The chaos stone disc flew out and expanded rapidly. In the end, it became as big as a planet and was boundless.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and controlled the chaos stone disc to suppress the void passage.</p><p>The chaos stone plate emitted a brilliant light as it tried to seal the spatial passageway.</p><p>“You want to seal the void passage? dream on!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Thearch roared and used all his might, wanting to break through uncle Kong’s sword light and stop Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Uncle Kong’s feet moved in mysterious steps. With each step, light would burst out from his body. As he took each step, the light on his body became brighter and brighter, and his sword force also became stronger and stronger.</p><p>He had already gained the upper hand and was suppressing the evil god tribe’s great emperor.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as a deep gash appeared on the evil god tribe’s great Emperor’s body, causing him to roar out in madness.</p><p>At this moment, the evil god tribe’s great emperors in the sky had also seen what was happening in the spatial passageway.</p><p>damn it, they want to seal the space passage. Stop them!</p><p>Demon spirit religion master roared. At this moment, he was fighting against Emperor Wu Xiang.</p><p>Emperor formless was formless and incorporeal. He transformed into thousands of figures that surrounded him.</p><p>The other great emperors also held their opponents back.</p><p>&Nbsp; the most terrifying of them all was huntian Emperor. His battle-power was terrifying, and he had the power to shake the world. He had single-handedly dragged down two great emperors.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and the chaos stone disc continued to suppress the void passageway.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The gigantic evil god tribe member held the edge of the void passageway with one hand while the other held onto the chaos stone plate.</p><p>For a moment, the chaos stone plate was actually blocked and could not be suppressed.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still too weak. On the other hand, the gigantic evil god race had at least the cultivation level of a true Emperor. It was normal for them to be able to block it.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>At this moment, uncle Kong shouted out coldly, and a sword light slashed out, chopping off the head of the gigantic evil god race member, splitting his head in half.</p><p>The gigantic evil god tribe member let out a loud roar before falling down powerlessly, his body disappearing into the vortex.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any resistance, the chaos stone plate pressed down and blocked the void passage.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The chaos stone plate trembled and was about to be completely embedded into the void. It became one with the void and sealed the void passageway.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The chaos stone plate kept shaking. The other side of the chaos stone plate seemed to be under a terrifying attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, uncle Kong brought Lu Ming and landed on the chaos stone disc. Endless energy from uncle Kong’s body surged into the chaos stone disc, helping Lu Ming to suppress it.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it, kill, kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s great emperor started to attack uncle Kong madly.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, the great emperor of the evil god tribe had also gone mad and was going all out. As such, Emperor formless and the others were no longer able to stop him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few figures charged into the cave.</p><p>Kill! Kill!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s thearchs started to launch a storm of attacks at uncle Kong and Lu Ming.</p><p>On one side, uncle Kong had to suppress the chaos stone disc and had to use a portion of his power. His battle power was naturally insufficient.</p><p>The long sword in his hand shone with endless sword light. Although he blocked the attacks of the great emperors, he staggered and blood spilled from his mouth.</p><p>“Uncle Kong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very worried.</p><p>Fortunately, Emperor formless and the others also arrived in the next moment.</p><p>Following that, the other great emperors also rushed in, and a chaotic battle broke out.</p><p>However, this space was very strange and large enough. Back then, the Lotus World had been here. There were Nine Worlds, which showed how large this space was.</p><p>&Nbsp; the great emperors were in a chaotic battle, and uncle Kong’s power was constantly pouring into the chaos stone plate.</p><p>Lu Ming did his best to control the chaos stone disc and activate its own power..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
