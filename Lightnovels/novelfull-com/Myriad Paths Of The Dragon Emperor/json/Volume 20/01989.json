He then helped bubbles kill the other Emperor-to-be.</p><p>As a result, those below the Emperor-to-be realm were no match for them and were killed in large numbers.</p><p>&Nbsp; it didn’t take long for the three-eyed God race to be completely wiped out.</p><p>After that, they charged in other directions.</p><p>This battlefield was extremely vast, and the sky was filled with the figures of cultivators and three-eyed gods.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others gathered together and charged into the battlefield like a sharp knife, hunting down the three-eyed God race.</p><p>With Lu Ming and bubbles ‘combat strength, they were almost invincible against anyone below the martial Supreme realm when they joined forces. They fought and killed the three-eyed God race members one after another.</p><p>&Nbsp; after fighting for several hours, the intense beating of war drums could be heard from the distant sky, and the three-eyed God race retreated.</p><p>As for the Gu Yue Holy Land experts, they also retreated back to the city.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not go to the base to exchange their merit points immediately. They did not have enough gains. They wanted to wait until they had accumulated more before exchanging all of them.</p><p>&Nbsp; as expected, on the second day, the three-eyed God race’s Army attacked again, and the ancient Moon sacred land’s experts also charged out.</p><p>In the vast and empty berserk mountain, the battle continued.</p><p>This was a war between two different races. No one would show mercy.</p><p>On the ground, there were mountains of corpses and seas of blood. There were humans, monsters, and even three-eyed gods.</p><p>After a while, the three-eyed God race seemed to feel that they couldn’t win and retreated.</p><p>However, they would come again the next day.</p><p>After fighting for more than ten days, Lu Ming and the rest gained a lot. When the three-eyed gods retreated again, Lu Ming and the rest returned to the base and went to the highest point to exchange for some treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming mainly wanted to exchange for sacred medicine and raw gemstones.</p><p>“All of you, bring out the third eye of the three-eyed God race!”</p><p>A group of old men stood on a huge counter.</p><p>These people were all powerhouses from the major forces.</p><p>Those resources were provided by the major forces. Each force would naturally send an expert to supervise.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest took out their storage rings. Then, a huge pile of the three-eyed God race’s third eye appeared.</p><p>It was piled up like a mountain, like a small hill, which stunned many people.</p><p>The three-eyed God race’s third eye was like a gem, sparkling and dazzling. It was extremely beautiful and contained a mysterious power. It could be used to forge weapons, and it was a pretty good material.</p><p>there are so many of them. Many of them are at the absolute Saint realm and even Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>terrifying. Lu Ming, the son of chaos. The combat strength of these people is too terrifying!</p><p>indeed, I’ve seen them fight. An Emperor-to-be was almost killed in seconds. No one can do it except for a Martial Emperor!</p><p>&Nbsp; many people in the surroundings turned to look at the three-eyed God’s eyes with fervent gazes.</p><p>One of them, a white-haired old man, did a quick count. These eyeballs of the three-eyed God race could be exchanged for a total of a million merit points. How shocking was this?</p><p>“What treasures do you want to exchange for?”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Then, a few figures walked out of the hall.</p><p>The one in the lead was a young man with an elegant demeanor.</p><p>“Feng wuchen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Feng wuchen swept a cold glance at Lu Ming and the others. His eyes landed on the pile of three-eyed God’s eyeballs, and a hint of greed appeared on his face.</p><p>“You guys want to exchange for treasures?”</p><p>Feng wuchen said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>I’m afraid that’s not possible. You’ve come too late. During this period, a large number of treasures have been exchanged, and the number of treasures in the Treasury has decreased sharply. I can’t exchange them for you for the time being!</p><p>Feng wuchen said with a cold smile.</p><p>“You don’t have enough treasures?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>what a joke. We didn’t have enough treasures the moment we arrived. How can the others have enough? ”</p><p>Huang Ling sneered.</p><p>the others have less, but you have more, so it’s naturally not enough. If you’re willing to give a discount, that’s fine too!</p><p>Feng wuchen sneered.</p><p>“If you say it’s not enough, then it’s not enough. You’re not in charge of this place, and the other seniors have never said it’s not enough!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang called out, looking at Feng wuchen unhappily.</p><p>although I’ve exchanged for many treasures during this period of time, I should have enough left!</p><p>An expert from the Phoenix Palace said.</p><p>that’s not right. If the rest of the items are exchanged by them, it would be disappointing and demoralizing if the others didn’t come!</p><p>An elder from the wind race spoke. The man from the Phoenix Palace’s face darkened, and he didn’t say anything.</p><p>This time, Gu Yue Holy Land was led by the wind race, and the wind race’s strength was undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p>during this time, the various forces will continue to replenish their treasures. You can come back when you’re done!</p><p>Feng wuchen smiled faintly.</p><p>“How long will it take to replenish it?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>“A few months, I guess!”</p><p>Feng wuchen said.</p><p>“Then we’ll come next time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. With a wave of his hand, he kept the three-eyed God’s eyeball.</p><p>the eyeballs of the three-eyed God race, why don’t you leave them here first? we’ll record it on our account, and we won’t give you any less!</p><p>Feng wuchen said.</p><p>“No need, I don’t trust a despicable person like you!” After Lu Ming finished speaking, he turned around and left.</p><p>The others sneered and turned to leave.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Feng wuchen’s face darkened. He rolled his eyes as if he was thinking of a scheme.</p><p>Hmph, in my opinion, that Feng is targeting us on purpose and not letting us exchange for it. I really want to beat him up!</p><p>Desolate Li said unhappily.</p><p>there are many forces present. They can’t deny it. At most, we’ll exchange for it later!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Those resources and treasures were all gathered by the major forces. They didn’t belong to the wind race alone. They couldn’t deny it.</p><p>He would just go there after a while.</p><p>In the next few days, they continued to battle against the three-eyed God race to temper themselves.</p><p>Ever since Xiangxiang Bella started cultivating, she had rarely fought with enemies. This was a very good training for her.</p><p>During this period of time, Xiangxiang Bella’s combat experience had increased rapidly. Even her cultivation showed signs of loosening up and was approaching the great saint perfection. This made others sigh. The cultivation speed of the child of heaven was truly shocking.</p><p>On this day, they set off again and set foot on the battlefield.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want to be separated from all of you and train on my own!” He said.</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“I have the same intention!”</p><p>Long Chen also said.</p><p>Then, Luo Tianyi and desolate power expressed the same intention.</p><p>Although it was safer for everyone to gather together, it was not very effective in training, and there was no sense of life and death crisis.</p><p>Only by facing a crisis alone could he stimulate his potential and reach a higher level.</p><p>if you want to cultivate the light of law, you must temper yourself in the midst of life and death. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to cultivate it!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said.</p><p>The other people’s eyes also revealed a burning light.</p><p>They were all proud Children of Heaven. They all had ambitions and wanted to become stronger.</p><p>Only by cultivating the light of law could one suppress other King physiques.</p><p>They all had this ambition..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
