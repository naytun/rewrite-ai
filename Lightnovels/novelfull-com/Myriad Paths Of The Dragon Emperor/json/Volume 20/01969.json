They had many more experts than Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Moreover, the Wind Clan, the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, and other forces had gathered. Many Emperor-to-be surrounded by the river of laws made them look like gods in the sky. Their terrifying aura pressed toward Lu Ming and the rest like a mountain.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, everyone stood in a defensive circle, their expressions grave.</p><p>Around them, many people were watching with different expressions.</p><p>Some people sneered. Take the he family for example. They did not have a good impression of either Lu Ming or the Heng family. It was best to kill each other.</p><p>As for the people from the sole divine temple, they stood in the distance and did not interfere.</p><p>Although Qiu Yue and Lu Ming were very close, Qiu Yue only represented her lineage in the sole divine temple. Moreover, he had not seen Qiu Yue yet.</p><p>Lu Ming is going to die today. I’ve expected this. How dare he go against Emperor-level forces like the Heng family and the Daluo heaven sect! Hehe!</p><p>Yu Shu sneered in the crowd, gloating over his misfortune.</p><p>The young geniuses from the purple flame villa had complicated expressions on their faces.</p><p>There were a few young men in the purple flame villa who had lost a bet to Lu Ming and had to listen to his orders. But now, in the face of so many masters from the Heng family and the Daluo heaven sect, they could only choose to ignore them and pretend that they did not see anything.</p><p>It was because it would be a dead end if they went there. Moreover, the Emperor-to-be in the purple flame villa would not listen to their orders.</p><p>damn it, they are relying on their numbers. It’s a pity that our desolate race has not appeared. If not, we would have gathered a bunch of Emperor-to-be. We would have hammered them to death!</p><p>Desolate li growled. He was very unhappy.</p><p>“It’s just a battle!”</p><p>Said Long Chen. He looked ordinary, but he was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>Why should a man be afraid of a battle?</p><p>don’t you all want to know how to pass through this abyss and head to the Ninth World?”</p><p>At this moment, the emotionless voice of the Galaxy rang.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Was the Galaxy finally going to say something?</p><p>if you want to cross the other side of the abyss, you have to open the abyssal bridge. The way to open the abyssal bridge is very simple, which is to sacrifice the bridge with blood. With the blood of many experts, you can open the abyssal bridge and lead to the Ninth World!</p><p>The voice of the Galaxy spread far and wide.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled again. They actually had to sacrifice the blood of experts to the bridge in order to reach the Ninth World.</p><p>“How much blood do you need?”</p><p>Someone asked in a serious tone.</p><p>“I don’t know. Naturally, the more the better!”</p><p>The eternal Star River channel then looked at Lu Ming and the rest. A cold killing intent burst out.’Today, 1’11 use your blood as a sacrifice to the bridge!” BOOM! boom! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the powerhouses of the Heng family, the Daluo heaven sect, and other forces stepped out. The river of laws surrounded them, and their Saint power burst out like a tide.</p><p>Today, they wanted Lu Ming and the rest to stay here.</p><p>“You guys focus on defense. Leave the stellar River to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread to the ears of Huang Ling and the rest. Then, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Dayan elixir furnace flew out, turning into the size of a mountain.</p><p>However, the Dayan elixir furnace did not float above Lu Ming’s head. Instead, it flew towards Huang Ling and the rest before it landed on the ground with a loud thud.</p><p>The DA yan elixir furnace had four legs and was lifted high up. Huang Ling and the rest were all below the furnace.</p><p>The DA yan cauldron was the most important treasure of the DA yan elixir Palace, its grade was far above ordinary monarch weapons. With that, Feng Ling, Long Chen and the rest only had to defend the surroundings, they didn’t have to worry about the top.</p><p>This way, their defensive power would increase greatly.</p><p>“Bubble, go help Huang Ling and the rest!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, be careful, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out and charged towards Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others.</p><p>“You guys deal with the others. Leave Lu Ming to me!”</p><p>The Galaxy said coldly. The powerful engine locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Hiding under a pill furnace means death as well!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be experts of the Heng family, Daluo heaven sect, and golden Crow clan stepped into the air and attacked Feng Ling, Long Chen, and bubbles from all directions.</p><p>On Huang Ling’s side, there were only dozens of emperors-to-be, much less than the other side. They could only gather together to defend.</p><p>All sorts of defensive Saint weapons and sovereign weapons were everywhere.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles attacked. The space around them distorted, forming mirror-like spatial shields that blocked in all directions.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Hundreds of attacks fell on Huang Ling and the others, some of which were blocked by the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already cut off his connection with the Dayan elixir furnace. Otherwise, the terrifying force would have followed the Dayan elixir furnace and injured Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the DA yan elixir furnace was only relying on its own solid and immortal characteristics to resist the attacks around it.</p><p>As expected, the attacks were all blocked by the great Yan elixir furnace.</p><p>The rest of the attacks were blocked by Feng Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>After all, although the other party had a lot of people, they didn’t have many angles to attack under the cover of the DA yan elixir furnace.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>kill! an expert from the Heng family roared and attacked Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>ah! at this moment, a shrill scream erupted from the crowd in the distance.</p><p>Someone had suddenly attacked and killed an expert.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Sacrifice your blood to the bridge!”</p><p>Someone coldly spoke.</p><p>“Then I’ll use your blood as a sacrifice to the bridge!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” let’s go! the person from before shouted, and a huge battle immediately broke out in that area.</p><p>There were many forces here who had grudges with each other. The chaos in that area seemed to affect the whole world. Those forces who had grudges with each other also began to fight.</p><p>Since he wanted to sacrifice the bridge with the blood of experts, he might as well use the blood of his enemies.</p><p>Therefore, a war broke out inevitably, and the scope of the war was getting wider and wider. Soon, the four sides were in chaos and Wars were everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming and the Galaxy stood in the air, facing each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no one will help you today. You’ll only die. Hand over the celestial Thearch’s sword and 1’11 leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>Said Xing Chen coldly.</p><p>long time no see. Your cultivation is still in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. Do you think you can kill me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“There are also strong and weak absolute Saints in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm!”</p><p>Xinghe said calmly.</p><p>His cultivation base was indeed the same as when he fought with Lu Ming and the others. He was still in the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>The main thing was that to break through to the Emperor-to-be realm from the perfection of an absolute Saint, one had to cultivate a law to perfection. However, the further one advanced, the harder it would be to cultivate.</p><p>This was especially true when he trained in the eternal laws.</p><p>However, even at the perfected absolute Saint realm, there were weak and strong nomological laws.</p><p>The maturity of the nomological laws in the eternal Star River had reached 99%. He was much stronger than when he was fighting with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>BOOM! A shocking aura burst out from the body of the Galaxy.</p><p>At the same time, a ring of light surrounded the Galaxy, making him look like a god.</p><p>This was the eternal light!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword light bloomed from Xing Chen’s hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
