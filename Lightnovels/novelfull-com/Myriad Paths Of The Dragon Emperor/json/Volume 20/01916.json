The leaders of these two small groups were all geniuses with King physique.</p><p>After that, all the elites of the purple flame villa from the ancient yang sacred land joined the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Some of the Supreme talents in the purple flame villa had made a bet that they would serve Lu Ming for 50 years. Now that the Dragon Alliance had been established, they naturally joined it.</p><p>After the people from the purple flame villa arrived, another group of people arrived, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>it’s the ancient Saint clan!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The ancient Saint tribe was an Alliance as well. There were more than a hundred of them. At this moment, all of them had arrived. However, they were blocked out by the light screen formed by the formation plate.</p><p>If Lu Ming was not willing to let them in, they could not enter.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s wrong? You won’t let us in?”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked in front and smiled.</p><p>“Are you here to congratulate me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie nianjun shook his head, a meaningful smile on his face. “We are here to join the Dragon Alliance!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The ancient Saint clan had come to join the Dragon Alliance?</p><p>Some people revealed looks of joy.</p><p>The strength of the ancient Divine Tribe was already shocking. In addition, there were several King physiques in the Alliance with the ancient Divine Tribe. If the ancient Divine Tribe joined the Dragon Alliance, the Dragon Alliance would be very powerful. It might even surpass the divine fire Alliance and be second only to the heavenly Emperor Alliance.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned as well. He did not expect Xie nianjun to bring the ancient Saint clan back to join the Dragon Alliance and rely on him.</p><p>Back in the divine wilderness continent, Xie nianjun and he were mortal enemies!</p><p>He still remembered Xie nianjun’s resentful expression.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Don’t you welcome us? Lu Ming, we are a family!”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Qiu Yue, Feng Ling, Luo Tianyi, and the others looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianjun were a family?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming and Xie nianjun had a secret relationship?</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but let their imaginations run wild.</p><p>Xie nianjun chuckled. Lu Ming, you’re my brother-in-law. Don’t You Want Me to join you?”</p><p>These words made many people’s hearts tremble even more.</p><p>Especially Huang Ling, Qiu Yue, Luo Tianyi, and a few other women, their faces were a little strange.</p><p>“Young master, are you married to miss nianqing? It’s normal for them to be married after so many years. But why don’t I see miss nianqing?”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s mind was filled with all sorts of thoughts, and she felt a little bitter in her heart.</p><p>Then, Qiu Yue shook her head and thought,” “Qiuyue, what are you thinking about? Young master and miss nianqing are a match made in heaven. You only need to stay by young master’s side and serve him well. How can you be worthy of young master?”</p><p>it turns out that Lu Ming already has a wife. But why didn’t he tell me? ”</p><p>Huang Ling thought to herself and felt a little disappointed.</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s eyes were also a little strange.</p><p>Long Chen was the only one who remained calm. He was Xie nianjun’s real brother-in-law.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly, but he could not refute Xie nianjun’s words.</p><p>Given his relationship with Xie nianqing, it was only a matter of time before they got married. Xie nianjun was Xie nianqing’s elder sister, so it wasn’t wrong to call him brother-in-law.</p><p>“Are you guys really here to join the Dragon Alliance?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p>that’s only natural. Currently, the yuan mountain sacred Academy is split up by many powerful individuals. You are my relative and are the most familiar with you. I would naturally come to seek refuge with you!</p><p>Xie nianjun said with a smile.</p><p>don’t try to get close to me. You wanted to kill me back then. I really doubt your intentions!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>people change. Back then, 1 was too short-sighted in that corner of the world. Now, I naturally have to look at the long term. There is no eternal enemy in this world!</p><p>Xie nianjun said with a smile on his face. Compared to his cold and arrogant self, he was indeed very different.</p><p>you can join the Dragon Alliance, but the Dragon Alliance has its own rules. If you break any of the rules, I won’t show you any mercy!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>Xie nianjun chuckled. Her position in the ancient Saint clan seemed to be extraordinary. The other members of the ancient Saint clan seemed to listen to her.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to underestimate Xie nianjun.</p><p>Ever since he met this woman in the yuan continent, Lu Ming had always felt that she was dangerous and mysterious.</p><p>In her body, Lu Ming seemed to sense a terrifying power that was dormant. Once it exploded, it would be earth-shattering.</p><p>He had the same feeling when he saw Xie nianqing.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming controlled the array disc and let the ancient sacred clan members in.</p><p>“Alright, let’s start the Alliance!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>However, this was the yuan mountain sacred Institute after all. The conditions were limited. The process of establishing an Alliance was very simple.</p><p>Everyone paid their respects to Lu Ming, and then the banquet was held to celebrate.</p><p>While everyone was eating and drinking, someone else descended outside the area covered by the formation plate.</p><p>“The one and only holy temple!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across.</p><p>A few heaven’s favorites from the sacred Hall stood outside the light screen. The one in the lead was Yu Shu.</p><p>Yu Shu, you’ve joined the heaven Emperor Alliance for a long time. What’s the matter with you here today? ”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Could it be that you want to switch sides and join my Dragon Alliance? The Dragon Alliance doesn’t dare to accept people who change sides at will!”</p><p>One of the geniuses from the purple flame villa laughed.</p><p>“Hmph, we’re here today for my Junior Sister!”</p><p>Yu Shu snorted and looked at Qiu Yue. Junior Sister Qiuyue, come with us and join the heavenly Emperor Alliance. If you stay in the Dragon Alliance, you’ll get into trouble sooner or later!</p><p>“Did Luo cangqiong send you here?”</p><p>Qiu Yue said indifferently.</p><p>that’s right, Luo cangqiong asked us to come here, but it was also our own idea. There is no benefit for you to stay in the Dragon Alliance!</p><p>Yu Shu said.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Qiu Yue scolded coldly.</p><p>Yu Shu’s expression changed, and she said gloomily,” “Qiuyue, don’t be so selfish. Luo cangqiong is the grandson of the great sovereign. If you go against him like this, you will only implicate the only Sacred Palace and even your master!”</p><p>hehe, you sure know how to talk nonsense. The matter between a few juniors actually involved the only sacred temple and the true Emperor. Isn’t that funny?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Yu Shu, don’t make it sound so high and mighty. You’re doing this for yourself, right? if you can bring me to the heaven Emperor Alliance, I’m afraid Luo cangqiong will reward you handsomely!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said sarcastically.</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>Yu Shu’s face turned red.</p><p>“You don’t want to get lost? Then come in and have a drink!”</p><p>Desolate power stepped into the air, his eyes flashing with a ferocious light..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
