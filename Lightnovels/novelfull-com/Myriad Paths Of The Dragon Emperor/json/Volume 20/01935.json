He then glanced at Lu Ming casually and said,”Since you’re a spy, why did you bring him here? Just cut it!”</p><p>Then, he casually waved his hand.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The middle-aged man acknowledged the order and walked towards Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>These people wanted to kill Lu Ming without saying anything. He was speechless.</p><p>He stopped the middle-aged man in his tracks and looked at Lu Ming coldly.”Brat, what else do you have to say?”</p><p>“I’ve already said that I’m not a spy. I just happened to pass by and wanted to ask you some questions!”</p><p>Lu Ming explained helplessly.</p><p>nonsense. Who in the entire mingyan country doesn’t know that this is the garrison of the divine Dragon Army? you actually said you were passing by. Isn’t that ridiculous?”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted coldly.</p><p>“Why are you talking nonsense with a spy? Drag him down and behead him!”</p><p>Sir Yan said impatiently.</p><p>On both sides, the others looked at Lu Ming with a faint smile on their faces.</p><p>It was an expression of superiority, as if he was looking at an ant.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression immediately changed. He revealed a ferocious look and said,”Kid, kneel down!”</p><p>He took a step forward and appeared next to Lu Ming. His claws were like an eagle’s claws as he tried to grab Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming did not Dodge. He stood there without moving.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s claw landed accurately on Lu Ming’s shoulder. A majestic energy burst out and surged into Lu Ming’s body, trying to make Lu Ming kneel.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not move. Even his expression did not change.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed.</p><p>He felt as if his claws had grabbed onto a piece of metal.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared. His long hair fluttered in the wind and his clothes puffed up. He circulated his Lv 9 martial Royal realm cultivation to the maximum and a vast amount of power continued to blast into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still stood there, not moving.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, a mere Lv 9 martial Royal realm was no different from an ordinary person who did not know how to cultivate. Even if Lu Ming stood still and let the other party kill him, the other party would not be able to touch a single hair on his body.</p><p>Above the tent, young master Yan stopped drinking and looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>The few people on both sides of the tent also looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>To be able to remain unmoving and move like a divine mountain under the power of a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert, one’s cultivation must not be weak. “Little bastard, kneel down!”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared. His face was completely red as he roared.</p><p>In front of young master Yan, he could not even make Lu Ming kneel down. This would definitely leave a bad impression in young master Yan’s heart. This was related to his future. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces, interesting. Liu Quan, you may leave!</p><p>Master Yan waved his hand.</p><p>The middle-aged burly man, Liu Quan, glared at Lu Ming with a murderous look and retreated with hatred.</p><p>it seems that you have some ability. Now, kneel down and answer me. Tell me your origin, and I may leave you with an intact corpse!</p><p>Young master Yan said lightly.</p><p>He was still full of arrogance, as if it was a great gift to Lu Ming to leave his corpse intact.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. I’ve already said that I’m just passing by. 1 want to find out some information. Since this place is not welcome, 1’11 take my leave!</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming was about to turn around and leave.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>you ungrateful dog. How dare you have such an attitude in front of young master Yan. Hurry up and kneel!</p><p>The few people on both sides of the tent shouted one after another. Their powerful auras enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear him and continued to walk out.</p><p>Above the tent, young master Yan’s face darkened.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to treat him with such an attitude. He was simply courting death.</p><p>“Take him down, but don’t kill him yet. Break his limbs!”</p><p>Master Yan said coldly.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>On both sides of the tent, several half-Saints received the order and surrounded Lu Ming in a flash.</p><p>kid, kneel down and kowtow to young master Yan. Then, destroy your cultivation. Perhaps young master Yan will be kind and spare your dog life!</p><p>Liu Quan was making a scene again.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned again.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming did not think much of these people as they were too weak. He could not be bothered to lower himself to their level.</p><p>However, the other party kept pressing on, which made Lu Ming a little unhappy.</p><p>“Brat, why aren’t you kneeling!”</p><p>A half-Saint shouted and was about to attack.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold shout was heard. Then, a group of people walked into the tent.</p><p>The person in the lead was actually a young woman.</p><p>This woman was extremely beautiful. She was wearing a fiery red armor that accentuated her curvaceous figure.</p><p>Moreover, she had a heroic spirit. Her temperament was completely different from the women that Lu Ming had met.</p><p>Behind the young woman, there were four strong men. Each of them had a strong aura and was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Clearly, they were all battle-hardened generals.</p><p>Seeing this woman, the half-Saints ‘expressions changed. They all bowed and saluted,” “Greetings, general Tian Jiao!”</p><p>“Back down!”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes were like lightning as she glanced at the half-Saints.</p><p>The half-Saints looked at young master Yan with embarrassment.</p><p>Master Yan waved his hand, and the half-Saints left.</p><p>“Heavenly flood Dragon, you’re here!”</p><p>Master Yan smiled and stood up from his seat.</p><p>“Yan Song, this place is my Divine Dragon Army. What right do you have to kill people in my Divine Dragon Army?”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes were bright as she stared at Yan Song.</p><p>Yan song’s eyes revealed a hint of gloominess, but in the next moment, he revealed a smile and said,” Tian Jiao, this man is a spy. He is here to spy on the military. I didn’t inform you, and I was planning to drag him out and kill him!</p><p>“A spy?”</p><p>The young woman looked at Lu Ming with a hint of killing intent in her eyes.</p><p>“I’m not a spy. I just happened to pass by!”</p><p>Lu Ming spread his hands.</p><p>“Impudent! You still dare to quibble? you simply don’t know what’s good for you. Tian Jiao, I’ll have this person killed first, then I’ll talk to you in detail!” Yan Song berated.</p><p>A half-Saint immediately stepped forward to take Lu Ming down.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The young woman waved her hand, since you’re a spy, then I have to interrogate you even more. You can all leave!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The four strong men who came with the young woman bowed and left.</p><p>“And you guys!”</p><p>The young woman looked at Yan Song.</p><p>“Tian Jiao, this person has some cultivation. 1 don’t feel at ease leaving you alone!”</p><p>Yan Song said.</p><p>“If he can kill me, what’s the point of you staying?”</p><p>The young woman said, full of confidence in herself.</p><p>She was the Marshal of the heavenly Dragon Army, the youngest war goddess of the mingyan country. If even she couldn’t defeat him, what was the point of Yan Song and the others staying?</p><p>Yan song’s expression was ugly. He cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and left with those people..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
