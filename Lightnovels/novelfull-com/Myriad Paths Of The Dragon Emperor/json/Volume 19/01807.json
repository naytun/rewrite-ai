His eyes flickered with a crazy killing intent. He controlled the alchemy furnace with all his might, intending to refine the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>At the scene, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air, including the Emperor-ranked experts.</p><p>Lu Ming was really going to refine an Emperor level expert. If he succeeded, it would definitely shock the entire ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>A great sage slaughtering an Emperor, even if he borrowed the great formation of this place, there were only a few examples in ancient times.</p><p>It would probably Pierce the heavens.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let go of the Skywolf tower’s demon Thearch. Do you think there’s only one demon Thearch in the Skywolf tower? The sacred land’s forces are far more powerful than you can imagine. If you really anger us, you’ll die without a grave!”</p><p>The WAN family martial sovereign roared. At this moment, he clenched his fists and his eyes were burning with anger.</p><p>He had actually lost a monarch weapon in this battle. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>That was a monarch weapon, it was extremely rare. How many years had he cultivated in his life? He had spent a lot of effort and money just to get three sovereign weapons.</p><p>Previously, he had no choice but to self-destruct one of his weapons. He could not wait to skin Lu Ming alive to vent his anger.</p><p>And now, Lu Ming actually wanted to refine the fey Thearch of the Sirius tower.</p><p>hehe, Martial Emperor powerhouses are indeed above the masses. They’re high and mighty. At first, the three martial emperors wanted to kill me, but they were defeated by me in the end. Now, they’re using the forces behind them to suppress me. They’re really high and mighty. I’ve finally seen it!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, but everyone could hear the deep mockery in his tone.</p><p>Three martial sovereigns were going against a junior. After being defeated, they actually brought up the power behind them. This was shameless.</p><p>The WAN clan’s Martial Emperor’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>The rest of the WAN family members at the scene looked ashamed and resentful. They secretly hated Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you insult the WAN family. I’ll make you regret this sooner or later!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang gritted his teeth.</p><p>The humiliation of the WAN clan’s martial sovereign was equivalent to the humiliation of the entire Wan clan. In the future, when they went out, they would definitely be looked down upon and pointed at by others.</p><p>Of course, they would not think about whether they were the cause of all this. They would only blame everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, release the demon Thearch!”</p><p>“Quickly release him. Otherwise, you won’t be able to escape no matter where you go!”</p><p>The people from the Skywolf tower roared one after another. Some of them transformed into huge wolves and glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>“If you want to save your demon Thearch, come and save him yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. At the same time, he focused on refining the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>But how would the demons of the Skywolf tower dare to go?</p><p>What a joke. Even the demon Thearch was locked in the furnace and couldn’t even protect himself. If they went to save him, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>“A bunch of cowardly rats!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He glanced at the WAN family’s martial sovereigns and the Golden Crow demon sovereigns and said coldly,” “If you want to kill me, then you have to be prepared to be killed by me, no matter who you are.”</p><p>No matter who it was?</p><p>Even if it was a Martial Emperor or a demon Emperor, he would still kill them!</p><p>arrogant, so arrogant. No matter how talented he is, he is destined not to go far. Kill him!</p><p>The WAN family martial sovereign shouted and controlled a sovereign weapon to attack Lu Ming from afar.</p><p>However, he did not dare to approach Lu Ming. He only attacked Lu Ming from a distance in an attempt to save the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>At the same time, the Golden Crow demon Thearch made its move. With a flap of its wings, Suns suddenly appeared in the sky and fell toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the great evolution elixir formation to form a light screen that blocked the surroundings.</p><p>For now, he didn’t attack. He just had to block the attacks. He would use all his other powers to refine the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>Since he wanted to kill him, he must make the other party pay a painful price.</p><p>The attacks of the WAN family’s martial sovereigns and the Golden Crow demon sovereigns were all blocked by the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>OWW! Roar!</p><p>From the great Yan elixir furnace, there were constant rumbling sounds, as well as the roars of the heavenly Wolf tower’s demon Thearch.</p><p>His voice was filled with anger, unwillingness, and fear.</p><p>Yes, everyone was terrified when they heard that.</p><p>Moreover, as time passed, the voice of the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower seemed to be getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. Was the high and mighty Fey Thearch really going to be refined?</p><p>“Still not releasing him!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereigns let out long howls, and their attacks became even stronger. However, they were all blocked by the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>As for the Martial Emperor of the purple pole sect and the demon Emperor of the heavenly Bird Palace, they were blocked by the Emperor-level powerhouses of the Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect and could not help.</p><p>ridiculous. You want to kill me, yet you’re asking me to let you go? idiots!</p><p>Lu Ming berated him directly. He did not care if he was an Emperor-level expert. He did not give him any face at all.</p><p>Some of the young men’s blood was boiling.</p><p>In front of so many experts, he wanted to refine a demon Emperor, berate a Martial Emperor, and settle The Grudge. What was he trying to do? How happy and carefree was this?</p><p>They yearned for it, but of course, they would never dare to do so.</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign felt as if a stone was stuck in his chest. He was so angry.</p><p>Ever since he had broken through to the Martial Emperor realm, no one had dared to speak to him like this for many years.</p><p>The other party was just a young man, but he couldn’t do anything to him. He was really aggrieved.</p><p>At this moment, the sound in the Dayan elixir furnace became softer and weaker.</p><p>The hearts of the experts of the Skywolf tower sank.</p><p>In the end, an unwilling voice came out of the Dayan elixir furnace, and then it went completely silent.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, their hearts in turmoil.</p><p>A demon Thearch had fallen just like that? He was killed by a junior?</p><p>Lu Ming had killed a demon Thearch!</p><p>This matter was bound to cause a huge wave in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>The WAN family’s martial sovereign and the Golden Crow demon sovereign retreated with an ugly expression. A trace of horror flashed in their eyes.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that the two of them were fast and decisive enough to rush out, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p>If any of them were trapped in the great Yan elixir furnace, they would end up like the demon Thearch of the heavenly Wolf tower.</p><p>In addition, the martial emperors of the purple pole sect, the demon Emperor of the heavenly Bird Palace, the Phoenix Palace, and the divine elephant sect also stopped fighting and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not open the furnace immediately. For safety’s sake, he continued to control the fire in the furnace and refined it for a while. He only opened the furnace when he could no longer feel the life aura in the furnace.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The moment the furnace was opened, everyone’s heart skipped a beat. Was the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower really dead?</p><p>The moment the lid was opened, waves of powerful energy rushed into the sky.</p><p>That was the power of the law, and also the power of the world, but then they all scattered with the wind.</p><p>As for the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower, he didn’t appear again.</p><p>It had really been refined!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p><p>“What a pity! I didn’t study the great evolution pill Scripture and my cultivation level isn’t high enough. Otherwise, 1 could’ve refined an Emperor pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered softly.</p><p>However, the people present were all experts. Although the voice was soft, they all heard it clearly.</p><p>“This guy… You still want to refine Emperor pills?”</p><p>Many people were speechless. This guy wasn’t just bold, he was a complete lunatic..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
