In other words, those below the perfected absolute Saint realm had all been killed by that wave of attacks.</p><p>Even many of the absolute Saints in the great circle who had survived were injured.</p><p>What a terrifying attack. Normal absolute Saints wouldn’t be able to fight back.</p><p>“A monarch weapon!”</p><p>The sword fiend’s cold gaze swept across Qiu Yue and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>At this moment, the remaining people were extremely frightened and madly rushed to the sky above the abyss.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also rushed up from another direction. There were more than twenty rainbow lights, and their speed was astonishing.</p><p>But the sword fiend’s speed was faster.</p><p>He took a step forward and appeared above everyone. Endless sword light began to gather.</p><p>This time, the endless sword lights merged together, leaving only 20 sword lights. However, the power of each sword light increased dramatically, giving people a terrifying feeling.</p><p>“I’ll use your blood as an offering to my sword. Kill!”</p><p>The swordfiend bellowed and more than twenty sword-lights charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>On average, each person had one sword light.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Everyone used all their strength to block it, but some of them couldn’t even block it. As the sword light flashed, all their attacks and defenses collapsed in an instant.</p><p>Another dozen or so people were killed and left here forever.</p><p>These people were all experts in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Only a small number of absolute Saints in the perfected absolute Saint stage were able to block the attack with their secret treasures, but they were still heavily injured.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, she tried her best to control the Yin Yang wheel to block it. Although she managed to block it, Qiu Yue’s body trembled and blood flowed from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Other than them, there were two other people who had blocked the sword light and were unscathed.</p><p>One of them was the purple-robed old man from before. He was in the Emperor-to-be realm and was surrounded by the river of laws, which destroyed the sword light in one fell swoop.</p><p>The other person was a woman in a Palace dress. She also had the cultivation of an Emperor-to-be and defeated the sword light.</p><p>The two emperors-to-be broke the sword light and rushed upward.</p><p>hehe, even an Emperor-to-be has to die!</p><p>Jian Sha sneered and waved the giant sword in his hand. Endless sword light appeared again, then converged into several sword lights and slashed at the two Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The two emperors-to-be shouted, and the river of laws formed a terrible attack, clashing with the sword light.</p><p>But this time, the sword light was obviously stronger. The two emperors-to-be trembled and were blown down.</p><p>this swordfiend hasn’t completely become a divine Emperor yet. We still have a chance. Let’s work together and charge out. If we split up, we’ll all die!</p><p>The purple-robed elder roared. A purple river of laws surrounded him, and he turned into a purple light, rushing to the woman’s side.</p><p>At the same time, the remaining absolute Saints in the great circle also charged toward them.</p><p>Qiu Yue was about to go over but was stopped by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s not go there. We’re going to get the Grand Lunar treasure Lotus!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sent a message to Qiu Yue. They did not rush toward the purple-robed elder and the others. Instead, they rushed toward the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>The purple-robed elder and the others gathered together and charged upwards.</p><p>The sword fiend cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and the other man, then ignored them. He looked at the purple-robed elder and the rest and sneered, although I’m close to becoming a saint Emperor, killing you is more than enough. After killing you, 1’11 use your blood to help me become a saint Emperor!</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>As the sword fiend said the last word, endless sword light gathered and finally turned into three huge sword lights. They slashed at the purple-robed elder and the others from three directions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were three terrifying attacks, and endless sword Qi filled the air. It left many hideous sword marks in the valley.</p><p>Several screams were heard. The remaining absolute Saints in the great circle were killed by the terrifying power. Only two emperors-to-be survived.</p><p>However, the faces of the two emperors-to-be were pale.</p><p>“Why aren’t you two joining forces? do you want to die Here together?”</p><p>The purple-robed elder roared, clearly directed at Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear her. He pulled Qiu Yue and rushed towards the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>He felt a terrifying danger from the sword fiend. He had a feeling that even if he joined forces with the purple-robed elder and the others, they would not be able to break out.</p><p>He could only rush out by using a strange move.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder roared and joined hands with the woman. The two rivers of laws turned into a terrifying attack and blasted upwards.</p><p>Jian Sha took a step forward and the three rays of sword light formed again, slashing towards the purple-robed elder and the other man.</p><p>The purple-robed elder and the woman’s bodies trembled as they were forced to retreat. They were completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was already approaching the astral treasure Lotus. The sword fiend’s eyes narrowed, and the huge sword in his hand, which was condensed from the sword source, shook slightly. Dozens of terrifying sword-lights shot toward Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>“Tai Chi formation plate!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind moved and the space between his brows glowed. The Tai Chi formation disk appeared and expanded rapidly, shielding the two of them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sword light landed on the Taiji formation disk, causing it to shake violently and send out sparks.</p><p>However, the Tai Chi formation disk was an Emperor-level treasure. It was so strong that not a single mark was left on it.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue continued to rush towards the Grand Lunar treasure Lotus.</p><p>The petals of the astral treasure Lotus rippled. It seemed to have sensed Lu Ming and the other man and was about to escape.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming said. Then, dense runes suddenly appeared on the ground around the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>These runes formed a sealing force that was like a huge net that enveloped the Grand astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>The Grand astral treasure Lotus released a dazzling sword Qi that rushed left and right, trying to rush out, but it was blocked by the seal.</p><p>With his previous experience, Lu Ming would not hold back. In the process of the attack, Lu Ming had secretly penetrated the array Dao laws into the ground and reached the vicinity of the Grand astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>Then, it suddenly attacked and sealed the Grand Lunar treasure Lotus.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue rushed past him. Lu Ming grabbed the Grand astral treasure Lotus and placed it into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue transformed into two beams of light and shot into the sky above the abyss from another direction.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then all of you stay!”</p><p>Jian Sha coldly spoke. Today, he definitely couldn’t allow anyone to leave. If someone left and news of him was spread out, it would attract true Emperor-ranked experts. If that happened, he would be finished.</p><p>He waved the huge sword in his hand and beams of sword-light appeared above Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s heads, slashing down at them.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with the Tai Chi formation disk. All the sword gleams struck the Tai Chi formation disk, causing it to vibrate. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s figures were also blocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The swordfiend blocked Lu Ming and Qiu Yue with his sword gleam and focused more of his energy on the purple-robed elder and the woman in the palatial dress.</p><p>The three huge sword lights that were attacking the purple-robed elder and the woman in the palace dress gathered together again to form an even bigger sword light.</p><p>The aura that this sword light gave off was even more terrifying..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
