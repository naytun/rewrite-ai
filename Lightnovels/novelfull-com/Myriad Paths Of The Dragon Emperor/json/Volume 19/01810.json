His turbid eyes looked towards the void and his ancient voice rang out,”Since you’re here, show yourselves!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed. Were there still experts hiding in the air?</p><p>The next moment, the void split open and two figures stepped out.</p><p>One of them was covered by endless purple light, while the other was filled with a terrifying demonic Qi.</p><p>The only similarity between the two was that they were both surrounded by the divine light of the world.</p><p>The true Emperor, the true Emperor again!</p><p>“It’s the true emperors of the purple Extreme sect and the heavenly Bird Palace!”</p><p>An Emperor-level character spoke, his voice heavy.</p><p>Today, the WAN family, the Sirius tower, the Golden Crow clan, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace, the five Forces that had enmity with Lu Ming, had all sent true emperors.</p><p>Perhaps other forces might also send true emperors, but they just didn’t appear.</p><p>hehe, five true emperors, but your purpose is to deal with a great sage realm junior. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by the world?”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s eyes swept over the crowd as he slowly spoke. His voice was filled with ridicule.</p><p>Lu Ming has killed many people from the five major forces. He’s insane and must die. No one can save him today!</p><p>The WAN clan’s true Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? You said that Lu Ming killed many people from the five major forces. The old man is curious and wants to ask a few questions!”</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>The WAN clan’s true emperors and the rest did not say anything. Today, the true emperors had arrived and Lu Ming could not escape. This old man alone would not be able to stop them. They wanted to see what this old man was up to.</p><p>“First, the people from the five major forces that Lu Ming killed were of the sage realm. Were they of the same generation as Lu Ming? Arc there any seven or eight-year-old or teenager children?”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice spread in all directions.</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor and the others fell silent. Their eyes flickered, but they didn’t reply.</p><p>“Senior, the people that Lu Ming killed were all of the same generation. Many of them were older than Lu Ming!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s voice rang out.</p><p>“Oh, I understand. Thank you, little girl!”</p><p>Uncle Kong smiled at Huang Ling and continued,”Did Lu Ming ask for help from the older generation?”</p><p>The WAN family, the Golden Crow race, and the other true emperors still didn’t answer.</p><p>“Senior, I was present for all these matters. Lu Ming did not seek help from the elders!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“I can be a witness!” Long Chen said.</p><p>“Alright, the third question. Did Lu Ming kill the people from the five major forces with his own strength?”</p><p>Uncle Kong asked again.</p><p>“Yes, it’s a full-on battle with my own strength!”</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“Mm! This old man understands!”</p><p>Uncle Kong nodded and looked at the true emperors of the WAN family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura exploded from uncle Kong’s body. It was as if a Sleeping Ancient beast had come back to life. The terrifying essence energy shot into the sky, and the qi and blood in his body were like flames.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s originally cloudy eyes were no longer cloudy. It was as if the sun, moon, and stars were rotating in them. It was also as if a flame was burning in his eyes, full of sharpness.</p><p>“In a direct battle between peers, you people from the five major forces were useless. You couldn’t defeat Lu Ming and were killed by him. You void emperors and true emperors actually shamelessly came out and said you wanted revenge. How ridiculous!”</p><p>“And you!”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s eyes looked at the true Emperor of the Sirius tower.”A Martial Emperor like you came to kill Lu Ming but was killed by him instead. How dare you come out and avenge him? do you still want your face?”</p><p>Uncle Kong’s voice became sonorous and powerful as it spread across the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming killed the martial sovereign of the Skywolf tower by relying on the power of the formation!</p><p>The true Emperor of the Sirius tower said.</p><p>“Nonsense. As a martial Supreme, he’s going against a junior in the eminent Saint stage. Do you want him to have a fair fight? I think you’re not only shameless, but also stupid!”</p><p>Uncle Kong berated him directly, causing the true Emperor’s expression to turn ugly.</p><p>“So what? It’s useless for you to say so much today. You can’t change the outcome. Lu Ming must die today!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s true Emperor spoke. His entire body was surrounded by weapons, and he looked extremely domineering.</p><p>No matter how much he said, it was useless. Lu Ming had to be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too shocking. Since they had already offended him, they had to get rid of him. Otherwise, they would be the ones to be destroyed in the future.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>“I’ve said so much not because I want you to leave, but because I want to say that since you can do this, I might as well do something like bullying the weak!” Uncle Kong smiled.</p><p>As soon as uncle Kong finished speaking, he took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This step turned the world upside down, dimmed the sun and moon, and shook the entire void.</p><p>In the distance, the Martial Emperor powerhouses ‘expressions changed drastically as they shouted,” “Quickly retreat!”</p><p>They led the people below the Emperor rank and retreated frantically, wanting to get away from that area because they felt a fatal danger.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>At this moment, the WAN family’s true emperors, the Golden crow’s true emperors, and the others ‘eyes narrowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of sword light burst forth from the walking stick in uncle Kong’s hand.</p><p>A sword light illuminated the nine Heavens. This sword was peerless and magnificent, like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens. It broke through the universe and slashed towards the WAN clan’s true Emperor.</p><p>“Ten thousand soldiers!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor roared. All the weapons around him lit up and actually combined together to form an extremely huge and strange weapon. He then attacked the sword light that uncle Kong had slashed out.</p><p>However, as the sword radiance slashed past, that strange weapon exploded into pieces and scattered in all directions. The sword radiance didn’t stop and continued to slash towards the WAN family’s true Emperor. It was unstoppable.</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor roared as a small world appeared. His body was within the small world as he retreated frantically.</p><p>However, even though he was fast, the sword light was faster. In an instant, it slashed at the WAN family’s true Emperor’s small world. Under everyone’s astonished gazes, the small world was split open by the sword light like a watermelon that was split in half.</p><p>The sword light did not stop and continued to slash towards the WAN clan’s true Emperor.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor roared madly. At this moment, his eyes were filled with endless fear.</p><p>In the next moment, the sword light slashed down and landed on the WAN family’s true Emperor’s forehead. His body instantly froze and he didn’t move at all.</p><p>All of his aura had completely disappeared. Even his life force had disappeared.</p><p>Then, under everyone’s horrified gazes, the WAN family’s true Emperor’s body turned into dust with a bang and disappeared from the world.</p><p>At this moment, the scene fell into a deathly silence.</p><p>It was as if everyone’s throat was being strangled by an invisible hand, and they couldn’t make a sound.</p><p>The WAN clan’s true Emperor was dead!</p><p>A true Emperor had been killed by a single sword strike, his body completely obliterated!</p><p>This was a true Emperor, standing at the peak of the world. If great emperors didn’t appear, who could compete with him?</p><p>But now, he was killed by a single sword.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Was this uncle Kong’s battle strength? It was far beyond his imagination and unbelievably powerful. He killed a true Emperor with a single sword strike..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
