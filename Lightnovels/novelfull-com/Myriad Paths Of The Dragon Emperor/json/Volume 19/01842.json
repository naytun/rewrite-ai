He looked coldly at the heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa, but why would he be afraid of him? He looked at Ouyang Wuji with a cold smile.</p><p>This made Ouyang Wuji’s expression even uglier.</p><p>you guys can be smug. In the third round, I’ll make you guys die miserably!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji was filled with hatred.</p><p>alright, Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wushuang have tied for this round of assessment. You can go back and rest. The third round of assessment will begin in seven days!</p><p>A clan elder announced before summoning a warship. Everyone boarded the warship and returned to the shenyuan imperial capital half a day later.</p><p>After returning to Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion, Ouyang Wushuang held a banquet as a reward. After three rounds of wine, everyone went back.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his room and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“My cultivation is about to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had broken through to the Supreme Saint realm. Now, his cultivation was finally going to break through again.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out a large number of raw gemstones and placed them at the side. Then, he sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s aura rose sharply. A strong suction force came from his body. The raw gemstones exploded one after another, turning into rolling raw energy that rushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura finally calmed down after half a day.</p><p>“Great sage great mastery!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>His cultivation had broken through to the great sage upper tier, and his combat strength had improved again. He was more confident about the third round.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to cultivate and consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the third round of the assessment had arrived.</p><p>This time, they met up in an empty space outside the divine origin imperial capital.</p><p>There was a huge mountain in front of them. It was tens of thousands of feet tall and pierced through the clouds. At the peak of the mountain, there was a huge flag fluttering in the wind.</p><p>Ouyang wudao, Ouyang Wushuang, Ouyang Wuji, and the others stopped a thousand miles away from the mountain.</p><p>the third round of the examination is very simple. It’s to snatch the military flag. Whoever can snatch that flag will be first. In the process, any means can be used!</p><p>An elder announced.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes flickered. Any method could be used. In other words, this round didn’t restrict killing.</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji’s eyes as they swept their gazes over Lu Ming, Ouyang Wushuang, and the rest.</p><p>however, the journey from here to the peak of the mountain has been filled with many formations, so it won’t be smooth sailing. Alright, now, you will stand in three positions!</p><p>The clan elder announced.</p><p>In an instant, their figures flickered, and the three parties each stood in three different positions.</p><p>“Lady Qiuyue, I’ll leave Lu Ming to you later. It’s best if you kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Wuji sent a message to Qiu Yue.</p><p>“I’m here to help you win the crown prince’s position, not to help you kill people!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming has been going against us time and time again. Otherwise, 1 wouldn’t have ended up like this. Since you’re here to help me, listen to me this once. That Lu Ming must die!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said coldly.</p><p>Qiu Yue frowned.</p><p>“Junior Sister Qiuyue, the sixth Prince is right. That Lu Ming has no respect for our sole divine temple at all. Not only has he injured a few junior brothers, but he has also completely disrupted our plans. If we let him off, we won’t be able to answer to our elders when we return!”</p><p>Yu Shu said from the side.</p><p>that’s right, Junior Sister Qiuyue. Your combat strength is the strongest among us. You’re more than capable of killing Lu Ming!</p><p>The rest of the people from the divine temple also chimed in.</p><p>“Alright, leave Lu Ming to me!”</p><p>Qiu Yue pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement. Ouyang Wuji and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the clan elder rang out.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the elder finished speaking, the three groups of people rushed out at the same time.</p><p>With their cultivation, they could travel a thousand miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, as soon as they rushed out, dense inscriptions appeared in the sky. Sword gleams formed and slashed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Each sword light was extremely terrifying and had the power of a Supreme Saint. There were a lot of them, hundreds of them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had no choice but to slow down. They launched attacks one after another, shattering the sword gleam.</p><p>However, there were countless inscriptions in the air. There were also all sorts of attacks like vines, flames, and lightning that blasted towards them. This greatly reduced their speed.</p><p>They joined forces to break through the attack and flew forward.</p><p>Ouyang wudao, Ouyang Wuji, and the others were also attacked by the formation, and their speed was greatly reduced.</p><p>However, it could only slow them down. If they wanted to pose a threat to them, the power of these formations was not enough.</p><p>The three groups of people were like three awls, flying toward the mountain at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Among them, Ouyang wudao was the fastest. With the help of the paragons of the Daluo heaven sect, Ouyang wudao’s overall strength was indeed stronger.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Ouyang Wuji and his men changed their direction and charged toward Lu Ming and the others. All kinds of terrifying attacks poured down on them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group retaliated and destroyed the attacks one by one.</p><p>However, as a result, their advance was blocked while Ouyang wudao was getting closer and closer to the mountain.</p><p>“Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji have joined forces!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>Obviously, Ouyang Wuji was here to stall Lu Ming and the rest so that Ouyang wudao could get first place.</p><p>“Ouyang, the two of us will charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a message to Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang shouted and struck out dozens of palm strikes. The terrifying palm force broke through the attacks and rushed out of the encirclement toward the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a vacuum tunnel appeared in the void, breaking all the attacks.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have become stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed out.</p><p>Meanwhile, Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the purple flame villa’s geniuses did not move. Instead, they fought against Ouyang Wuji’s men.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji shouted.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of white light shot out. As the white light passed by, even the space was frozen. A terrifying cold current rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a white scimitar.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch at the scimitar. The scimitar trembled and was sent flying.</p><p>A white light flashed and a figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze darkened.</p><p>“Ice seal!”</p><p>Qiu Yue waved her hand and the scimitar danced in the air. It emitted an even more terrifying cold current and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch, and the boundless energy hit the scimitar, sending it flying again. However, there was indeed a terrifying cold current that extended up Lu Ming’s arm, causing a layer of frost to appear on it.</p><p>&Nbsp; Primal Chaos laws began to revolve, and with a shake, the layer of frost was shaken off..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
