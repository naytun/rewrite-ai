He turned and ran.</p><p>This person’s movement technique was very special. With a single move, he turned into a bloody shadow and flew in all directions. It was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, Long Chen, and the heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa shouted. Their terrifying attacks covered the area in front of them, and the blood Shadows cast by the young man were all shattered.</p><p>The young man turned pale with fright and fled frantically.</p><p>However, how could his speed be compared to Lu Ming and the rest? he would be chased down very soon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a huge bloody handprint fell from the sky and rumbled toward the crowd.</p><p>“Absolute Saint, leave it to me!”</p><p>A Supreme Saint in the great circle of the purple flame villa rushed into the sky. His hand was covered in flames, and it seemed like he was holding a huge meteorite. He smashed it toward the bloody handprint.</p><p>With a violent boom, the meteorite and the bloody handprint collided and disappeared. In the sky, an old man in a blood-red robe appeared. He looked at the proud Son of Heaven of the purple flame villa with a serious expression.</p><p>A person in the great circle of the great saint realm could actually exchange blows with him. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>“Who are you people? Why are you attacking my blood soul sect?”</p><p>The blood-robed elder said in a deep voice.</p><p>you’ve committed too many evil deeds. Everyone has the right to punish you. Today is the day of your death!</p><p>The other Supreme talents from the purple flame villa stepped forward and surrounded the absolute Saint. They all had terrifying flames around them as they attacked the absolute Saint.</p><p>This absolute Saint was at a complete disadvantage and was in danger.</p><p>These geniuses of the purple flame villa all had medium-grade heaven spiritual bodies. Once they reached the perfected Supreme Saint realm, they would have no problem fighting against an ordinary lower-tier absolute Saint.</p><p>Moreover, it was a joint effort of several people.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, Ouyang Wushuang and the others, they charged toward the young man. Without a doubt, the young man was killed by Ouyang Wushuang, and they obtained three marks.</p><p>The absolute Saint was also killed by the purple flame villa elites.</p><p>Then, they continued to search, but they seemed to have run out of luck. They crossed a few mountains and killed a few absolute saints along the way, but they didn’t find the fourth mark.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, there’s someone over there. Chirp chirp!</p><p>Bubbles pointed at a small hill and said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. The small hill looked very ordinary. There was nothing unusual about it. He could not sense any life aura cither.</p><p>However, bubbles controlled the space-time laws and could travel through space. It should not be wrong to sense someone.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a force of his fist was directed at the small hill. The small hill immediately exploded. In the midst of the smoke and dust, he saw an old man flying into the distance in a panic.</p><p>an absolute Saint. He has a mark on his body!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Don’t let him get away!”</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to give chase. The rest of the people also chased after the elder.</p><p>As he chased, all kinds of attacks poured towards the old man.</p><p>Although the elder was an absolute Saint, he was no match for so many people. He spat out blood and ran like crazy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, there was a sound of something breaking through the air in front of them. Everyone looked over and their expressions changed.</p><p>The people in front of him were Ouyang Wuji and the heaven’s favorites he brought with him.</p><p>“This person has a mark on his body. Kill him!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji also noticed the mark on the old man’s body. He immediately roared and charged toward the old man.</p><p>The old man’s eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>“Not good! Ouyang Wuji and the others are going to fight with us for it!”</p><p>One of the purple flame villa’s heaven’s favorites had an ugly expression on his face.</p><p>“Bubble, stop them!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Paopao flew out. With a wave of her little hands, ripples appeared in the space.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji and the others were flying at high speed, but they suddenly stopped as if they had hit a wall.</p><p>“Damn it, spatial laws, break for me!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji roared as he unleashed terrifying attacks that blasted the space in front of him.</p><p>However, this space also contained the Law of Time. Their attacks could only shake the space but could not break it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming, the ninth Prince, and the others charged toward the elder at the absolute Saint stage.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger out. A terrifying finger condensed and crushed towards the other party.</p><p>&Nbsp; the elder’s body exuded a pitch-black aura that converged into an evil ghost that pounced at the primal Chaos tribulation finger. But the finger crushed the evil ghost and forced it to retreat.</p><p>“Chaotic heaven and earth!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang arrived and struck out with both palms. Everything became chaotic as the terrifying palm force blasted towards the old man.</p><p>They did not show any mercy. The entire blood soul sect cultivated with the blood soul of ordinary people. Countless people had died at their hands. They were extremely vicious and deserved to be killed.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s palm force almost tore his opponent’s body apart. He spat out a mouthful of blood and was severely injured.</p><p>what powerful combat strength! He has a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body and one of the king path laws, the law of chaos!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s cultivation base was at the peak of the great saint realm, but his combat strength was amazing. His spiritual body was a superior-grade heaven spiritual body, and he also controlled the king path law. He was indeed worthy of being the silver inheritor of the Hunyuan sect. None of them were simple.</p><p>“Damn it, hurry up and attack, hurry!”</p><p>On the other side, Ouyang Wushuang shouted. If the old man was killed by Ouyang Wushuang or Lu Ming, they would not have a share.</p><p>“Ice seal!”</p><p>A delicate shout rang out, and a terrifying chill filled the air, as if it was going to seal everything in ice.</p><p>It was Qiu Yue. At this moment, Qiu Yue seemed to have turned into an ice goddess.</p><p>She was wearing a white dress, and there was a curved blade in her hand that emitted a terrifying coldness. When the curved blade slashed out, even the space was frozen, turning into pieces of ice crystals that were about to break, brother Lu Ming, all the best. I can’t hold on any longer, chirpy!</p><p>Paoba cried out. It was too difficult for her to block so many experts by herself.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed with his finger again. He used almost all his strength.</p><p>The other party tried his best to resist, but as the finger force crushed over, the other party still spat out a large mouthful of blood. The bones in his body crackled, and it was unknown how many bones were broken.</p><p>Then, the attacks from Ouyang Wushuang, Long Chen, and the others arrived.</p><p>Facing the attacks of so many heaven’s favorites, the other party couldn’t resist at all. With a scream, he was turned into ashes by the attacks.</p><p>A mark flew out and entered Ouyang Wushuang’s crystal ball.</p><p>The fourth mark.</p><p>“Bubble, retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles. Then, bubbles moved and flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji roared as his eyes turned red.</p><p>There were only 12 marks in total, and each of them was very precious. Now, he had to watch Ouyang Wushuang get one. He was furious.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang shouted and led everyone away..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
