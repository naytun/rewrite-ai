The reincarnation halberd had been in his hands for quite some time, but there had been no abnormality.</p><p>However, since just now, the reincarnation halberd had been shaking non-stop even though it was in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>It seemed that it was because of Ouyang Moli.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have much time to think. He moved and appeared in front of Ouyang Moli. A wave of energy surged out and pushed the five youths back. “Who are you? how dare you meddle in the business of our Ouyang imperial clan!”</p><p>The yellow-robed youth saw Lu Ming and was not afraid at all. He shouted loudly.</p><p>“You guys can go, I won’t make things difficult for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said.</p><p>“Hand over Ouyang Moli and we’ll leave!’*</p><p>The yellow-robed teenager spoke. Lu Ming did not dare to make a move, thinking that Lu Ming was afraid of them.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. A cold killing intent emanated from him and gushed toward the five teenagers.</p><p>Lu Ming had been through many battles in his life and his killing intent was extremely strong. Being enveloped by Lu Ming’s killing intent, the five youths shuddered and their faces turned pale.</p><p>“You… Just you wait!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s eyes flashed with fear. After leaving behind those harsh words, he left with his four other young men.</p><p>“Senior, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli stepped forward and bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s nothing, no need to thank me. Why arc they targeting you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Because they want to snatch my pill. This pill is my last hope. I can’t let them snatch it away!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s eyes shone with determination.</p><p>“You haven’t awakened your bloodline, have you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up Ouyang Moli with a curious look on his face.</p><p>In the yuan continent, especially in a place like the ancient sun sacred land, it was extremely rare to see a teenager who had not awakened his bloodline. No wonder the yellow-robed youth called Ouyang Moli trash.</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s eyes were filled with dejection, but it was only for a moment.</p><p>His eyes became firm again as he clenched his fists and said,” ’’Senior, are you also looking down on me? Although I can’t awaken my bloodline now, I firmly believe that I will awaken my bloodline in the future and become a martial arts master. I will definitely step on those who look down on me!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a strange light. He activated his secret skill and carefully sized up Ouyang Moli. The more he sized him up, the more surprised he became.</p><p>“I’m afraid you won’t be able to awaken your bloodline even if you use that stabilizing pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s body trembled as a look of despair appeared in his eyes. Then, his body trembled continuously as he clenched his fists tightly. His nails dug into his flesh and blood flowed out</p><p>“Why? Why can’t I awaken my bloodline?”</p><p>Ouyang Moli let out a low roar.</p><p>“But I can help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>His words made Ouyang Moli’s body tremble again. His eyes shone with a bright light. It was the light of hope. Then, with a bang, Ouyang Moli knelt in front of Lu Ming and bowed dceply/’Master, please accept this disciple’s bow!” “Master? I didn’t say I would take you as my disciple!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose, feeling a little speechless.</p><p>“As long as you can help me awaken my bloodline, you will be my master!’1</p><p>Ouyang Moli said with determination.</p><p>you don’t have to be my disciple. I’ll make a decision after I help you awaken your bloodline. If you meet the conditions, I can take you in as a disciple on behalf of another senior!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Many thanks… Senior!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli replied.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward his room with Ouyang Moli following him. Soon, they arrived at Lu Ming’s room. Lu Ming waved his hand and brought Ouyang Moli into the mountain and river diagram. They arrived at the top of a mountain.</p><p>Ouyang Moli looked at him curiously.</p><p>this is the treasure of the abode. Sit down cross-legged first, I’ll help you awaken your bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli nodded and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and tapped on Ouyang Moli’s body continuously. Streams of Saint energy surged into Ouyang Moli’s body. Then, layers of Saint energy wrapped around Ouyang Moli, stimulating the blood in his body and helping him to awaken the power of his blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, Ouyang Moli’s spine began to emit a blood-red light. As time passed, the blood-rod light became more and more intense. Finally, a Black Vortex appeared and floated above Ouyang Moli’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes burst out with a bright light as he stared at the vortex.</p><p>reincarnation! It really is the reincarnation bloodline and the reincarnation body!</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself in amazement.</p><p>The bloodline that Ouyang Moli had awakened was the reincarnation bloodline. As he cultivated in the future, his body would transform into the reincarnation body. Once he broke through to the sage realm, he would be able to control the law of reincarnation.</p><p>This was a rare heaven’s favorite, one of the sons of God, the son of Samsara!</p><p>Like Lu Xiangxiang, he was born with a living body and could control the laws of life in the future.</p><p>The life law and the reincarnation law were both among the ten strongest laws.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected to meet a Son of God here.</p><p>It was no wonder that the reincarnation halberd had been shaking non-stop. It was obvious that the reincarnation halberd had sensed Ouyang Moli’s physique.</p><p>“I’m really lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>He had agreed to help the reincarnation Emperor find an inheritor, and the Son of reincarnation was the best inheritor.</p><p>bloodline! I’ve awakened my bloodline! I’ve finally awakened my bloodline!</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Moli felt the awakening of his bloodline and cried out in excitement.</p><p>For so many years, no matter how hard he cultivated, he couldn’t awaken his bloodline. He was called trash.</p><p>He had once thought that he was a good-for-nothing, and if not for his strong willpower, he would have given up on the path of martial arts.</p><p>Now that his bloodline had finally awakened, how could he not be excited? How could he not be excited?</p><p>After a long while, Ouyang Moli finally calmed down. He knelt down in front of Lu Ming and said,” ‘Disciple greets master!”’</p><p>your master is not me. I will pass on the inheritance of another person to you. That person is your master!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, in my heart, I only recognize you as my master. You are the one who gave me the grace of rebirth, and no one can compare to this grace!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>“Are you sure? That person is a great emperor expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The great emperor?”</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>The great emperor was the peak expert of the world. The heavenly Emperor was only a legend. The great emperor was the peak.</p><p>Lu Ming was going to pass on the legacy of a great emperor to him?</p><p>But very quickly, his eyes became determined again.. “In my heart, you arc my master!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
