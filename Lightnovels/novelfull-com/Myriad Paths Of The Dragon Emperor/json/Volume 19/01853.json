What’s the matter?”</p><p>...</p><p>Ha Zheng asked.</p><p>I’m looking for you because of the ancient wilderness realm, of course!</p><p>Mo Qingshan continued.</p><p>These words caused many people’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>The ancient Savage barren realm was only a legend in barren city. No one had been able to find it for countless years. Could it be that ha Zheng had some clues?</p><p>Lu Ming was also greatly shocked.</p><p>Didn’t he come here to search for the savage barren ancient realm and the savage crystal?</p><p>“Hahaha, Savage barren ancient realm? I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person. How would 1 know where the savage barren realm is?”</p><p>Ha Zheng laughed out loud.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, you’re still trying to hide it even now? You entered the ancient Savage barren realm a few months ago, didn’t you?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s words shocked the rest of the people.</p><p>Ha Zheng had entered the ancient Savage barren realm. Was that true?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on ha Zheng.</p><p>Ha Zheng’s expression was as dark as a piece of charcoal.</p><p>“It seems that there’s a traitor in the HA family!”</p><p>Ha Zheng said coldly, enunciating each word.</p><p>But in other words, he admitted it.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flashed with a fiery light. Was there really such a thing as the savage barren ancient land in this world?</p><p>It was rumored that there were countless treasures in the ancient Savage barren realm.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, tell me the entrance to the ancient Savage barren realm!”</p><p>A tall and sturdy man spoke. This person was the pang clan’s patriarch. He held a thick iron rod in his hand, and as he waved it, it made whooshing sounds.</p><p>The leaders of the other forces also released their powerful auras and locked onto ha Zheng.</p><p>“You want to threaten me? You guys are still lacking!”</p><p>Ha Zheng said. The aura on his body grew stronger and stronger. A River of laws surrounded his body.</p><p>This was the symbol of an Emperor-to-be. Only when one completely mastered a type of law could a River of laws be formed.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’d like to give it a try!”</p><p>The pang family head’s body swelled up, and his aura was like a rainbow. The iron rod in his hand expanded, turning into a giant rod that reached the sky. With the force of Mount Tai, he pressed down on ha Zheng.</p><p>Ha Zheng’s expression darkened. The river of laws danced, and his fist radiance shook the sky as he punched out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying boom shook the entire barren city. The giant stick was blown away by ha Zheng, but he was also forced to step back, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded and couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Ha Zheng had actually been forced to retreat.</p><p>That was an Emperor-to-be who controlled a complete set of laws. With the river of laws surrounding him, his combat power was astonishing. He could easily crush people in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, ha Zheng had actually been forced to retreat by a person in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage.</p><p>hahaha, ha Zheng, I heard that you were heavily injured after entering the ancient Savage barren realm. As expected, with your current battle-power, how can you fight against the six of us? ”</p><p>The pang family’s patriarch laughed.</p><p>Many people came to a sudden realization. So ha Zheng was injured. No wonder his battle prowess had been greatly reduced.</p><p>“We were going to take action in a few days, but since you’ve shown up today, we’ll take action while we’re at it. Ha Zheng, 1 advise you to tell us the entrance to the ancient barbaric realm. Otherwise, the HA family will disappear from barren city from now on!”</p><p>Another leader of a force said coldly.</p><p>Ha Zheng’s expression was extremely dark. There was a traitor in his ha family, and he had great power. Otherwise, he would not have known that he had entered the ancient Savage barren realm and had been injured.</p><p>If he was at his peak, he would not be afraid even if the six Forces joined forces.</p><p>But now, he had not recovered from his injuries and was no match for the combined forces of The Six Forces.</p><p>do you really want to go to the ancient Savage barren realm? let me tell you, the ancient Savage barren realm is very dangerous. I was injured before I even went deep!</p><p>Ha Zheng said.</p><p>you don’t have to worry about that. All you have to do is tell me the entrance to the ancient Savage barren realm!</p><p>Mo Qingshan said.</p><p>Which martial arts powerhouse had not walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood? why would they be afraid of danger?</p><p>Moreover, danger was often accompanied by opportunities. If one could obtain it, they would soar to the sky in one go.</p><p>“It is fine if you want me to tell you the entrance to the ancient wild region. However, you have to promise me one thing…”</p><p>A hint of killing intent flashed through ha Zheng’s eyes.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan asked.</p><p>“Help me kill those two little B * stards!”</p><p>Ha Zheng’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Mo Qingshan, the pang family’s master, and the others also turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s just two juniors, easy!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s eyes glowed with a cold light. A powerful aura spread towards Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. He then sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue and Rao Pao.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, a ray of sword light bloomed from mo Qingshan’s hand and headed towards Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>People in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm had profound cultivation and powerful combat strength. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were far from being their match.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he and Qiu Yue retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Do you think you can escape from my hands? Behead him!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan shouted coldly as he unsheathed the long sword on his back. It transformed into an endless sword radiance that blotted out the sky and covered the sun as it flew towards Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had no way of avoiding it.</p><p>Many people sighed. These two young men with unparalleled talent were going to fall here.</p><p>Although the two of them were talented, they were no match for an old monster like the head of the mo family.</p><p>Endless sword light enveloped them, stabbing Lu Ming and Qiu Yue until they were like a hornet’s nest.</p><p>However, there was no trace of blood-red light. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s bodies shattered like illusions.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s figures suddenly appeared beside hamoti.</p><p>“Not good! Stop!”</p><p>Ha Zheng’s expression changed drastically. He roared and wanted to stop them, but it was too late.</p><p>Lu Ming clasped Hamilton’s neck and held him in his hands.</p><p>“If you make a move, I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard, causing ha Zheng to stop in his tracks.</p><p>“Let him go, or you’ll die a terrible death!”</p><p>Ha Zheng said coldly.</p><p>He had been too careless. He had never expected that not only did Lu Ming not escape, but he also dared to take down hammerty. He was simply too bold.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming and the rest were too strange. They could suddenly appear next to hamoti, catching him off guard.</p><p>That was the Law of Time and space!</p><p>Ha Zheng’s gaze turned to bubbles with shock in his eyes.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming exerted force in his palm and Floly energy surged into hamerty’s body, causing him to let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Ha Zheng roared.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, are you going to kill these two little B * stards or not?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan asked with a cold face.</p><p>He was very upset. Not only did Lu Ming and Qiu Yue escape from his hands, but they had also taken control of hammerty. He had lost face.</p><p>“Kill your mother’s fart!”</p><p>Ha Zheng cursed.</p><p>How could he kill hammerty when he was already in Lu Ming’s hands?</p><p>Was he trying to kill hammerty?</p><p>“Mind your words!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan said with a cold face.</p><p>“Kid, let go of Murti and I’ll let you go!”</p><p>Ha Zheng glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let him go? If you let us into the ancient Savage barren realm, I’ll naturally let him go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and retreated with Hamilton, away from mo Qingshan, ha Zheng, and the rest..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
