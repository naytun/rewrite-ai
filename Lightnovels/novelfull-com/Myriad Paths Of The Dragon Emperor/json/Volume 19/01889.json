However, if they refined the sword source, they might be able to improve further. This was especially so for those who cultivated the sword. The sword source was of great help to them.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for a while more. Qiu Yue had also finished her cultivation and was refining a sword source.</p><p>Then, the two of them left the place and continued their search.</p><p>In the process of looking for the astral treasure Lotus, it would be good to obtain some sword sources and improve his cultivation.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them found another sword source. They put it away temporarily and did not refine it.</p><p>The sword tomb was really huge and seemed to be boundless. Lu Ming and the rest wandered around for an entire day but they could not see the end.</p><p>As for the sword source, he had also obtained four, so each of them had two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>All of a sudden, a group of figures rushed out from a Mountain Valley in front of them and surrounded the two of them.</p><p>There were a total of eight people. They were either old or middle-aged men. Each of them was filled with killing intent and a strong aura.</p><p>There were five great saints and three absolute Saints. However, the strongest one was only in the absolute Saint upper tier!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“So it’s two little brats!”</p><p>One of them sneered, his cold gaze sweeping across Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>but this girl is really beautiful. I can enjoy her!</p><p>A skinny middle-aged man, who was as thin as a bamboo pole, scanned Qiu Yue with a burning gaze.</p><p>“Brat, hand over all the treasures you have!”</p><p>The skinny man said coldly.</p><p>On average, there would be people entering the sword tomb every few days. Therefore, there were countless people in the sword tomb. There were all kinds of people.</p><p>There were even some people who were active in the sword tomb all year round. They specialized in killing and plundering other people’s treasures and sword sources for cultivation.</p><p>In the sword tomb, no matter what faction you were from, you would die in vain. No one would know who killed you or how you died.</p><p>Obviously, these people in front of him were specialized in killing and plundering. They were specifically looking for those who were alone or had a small number of people.</p><p>1’11 give you three breaths to get lost. Three!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“What? This kid told us to get lost. Haha, 1 didn’t hear wrong, did I?”</p><p>Some people laughed out loud, unable to believe their ears.</p><p>Judging from Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s age, how old could they be? what cultivation level and combat strength could they have at this age?</p><p>Asking them to get lost was simply ridiculous!</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak. His voice was even colder and filled with a cold killing intent.</p><p>The faces of the eight people on the other side darkened. It seemed that Lu Ming was not joking. Could it be that Lu Ming had some kind of backing?</p><p>However, from the looks of it, the Lu Ming duo was not even thirty years old. How could they be their match at such a young age?</p><p>They had been active in the area near the Taiyi sword tomb for more than a hundred years. During this period, they had met some young people, but they were no match for them at all. Many people had died at their hands.</p><p>However, it was the first time they had seen someone as confident as Lu Ming.</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Lu Ming slowly spat out the last word, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p>it seems that you don’t want to leave. Then 1’11 fulfill your wish and let you be buried here with the thousands of battle swords!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re talking big. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>A great saint in the Great Perfection realm took a heavy step and rushed toward Lu Ming like a cannonball. His Saint power and laws exploded and pressed down on Lu Ming like a giant beast.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and kicked out. He moved later but reached first. His foot landed on the other party’s dantian.</p><p>The other party let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying thousands of meters away. He crashed into a mountain peak that was filled with combat swords, creating a huge pit on the mountain peak.</p><p>As for himself, he was already exhaling more than inhaling.</p><p>The remaining seven people were stunned.</p><p>A great saint in the Great Perfection realm was like a baby in Lu Ming’s hands. He did not even have the strength to resist.</p><p>Could it be that this person had the battle power of an absolute Saint at such a young age? How was that possible?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The aura of a great saint in the great circle was fully released. The powerful aura locked onto the other seven people.</p><p>He had already given the other party a chance. Since the other party did not grasp it, then he would just kill them all.</p><p>Anyway, these people were not good people. Many people like Lu Ming and the rest had died in their hands.</p><p>Qiu Yue stood at the side and did not make a move.</p><p>She was very clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength. She did not need to take action to deal with these people!</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>die! the skinny man shouted. His aura burst forth and he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other six people moved as well. Each of them released their aura and a terrifying attack was launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still. An absolute holy weapon sword appeared in his palm and he swept it out.</p><p>A full moon-like sword light burst out and slashed in all directions, destroying all the attacks of the other party in an instant.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood light burst forth and blood Qi filled the air. The seven figures pounced quickly, but they retreated even faster.</p><p>The seven figures flew a thousand meters away and landed heavily on the ground. Six of them were already dead and were killed by Lu Ming’s sword-light.</p><p>Only the skinny man still had a trace of life and was not dead yet.</p><p>His eyes were wide open, filled with fear and disbelief.</p><p>He was just a young man who was less than 30 years old, but he had the cultivation of the great sage accomplished realm. His combat power was even more terrifying. Even he, who had the cultivation of the great sage great mastery, could not withstand a blow.</p><p>Could it be that the young people these days were all so terrifying?</p><p>They had been in the sword tomb for over a hundred years and had not gone out. Could it be that the outside world had changed?</p><p>With endless questions, he took his last breath.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the eight people’s storage rings appeared in his hand. With a sweep of his spiritual senses, he could see the contents of the storage rings at a glance.</p><p>These people were really rich. The orirocks were piled up like a mountain. It could be seen that they had killed many people over the years.</p><p>There were also about ten sword sources in total.</p><p>The sword source was a consumable item. It was already good enough to have ten of them. Lu Ming gave half of them to Qiu Yue and left the place.</p><p>In the next few days, they obtained a few more sword sources, but they still didn’t see any trace of the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>It seemed like it wouldn’t be easy to find the great sui treasure Lotus. He needed to be prepared for a long battle.</p><p>“There’s a sword source there!”</p><p>Suddenly, they found a sword source in front of them. The two of them rushed toward it.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword hummed as the sword source actually flew up by itself and whizzed towards the depths of the sword tomb.</p><p>The sword source actually moved on its own?</p><p>They didn’t have much time to think. They stepped on the air and chased after the source of the sword.</p><p>However, the speed of the sword source was astonishing. It was like a ray of light that disappeared in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming and the other man could not catch up with it.</p><p>“There’s one there too!”</p><p>The two of them chased for a while before Qiu Yue suddenly pointed in another direction and exclaimed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
