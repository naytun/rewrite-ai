He stomped his feet and pointed his fingers like a sword. A shocking sword light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>However, another beam of light shot out and dispersed the sword light.</p><p>“You want to stop me with the great formation? naive!”</p><p>The martial sovereign of the WAN clan shouted and rushed into the area of the furnace Mountain. At the same time, his body glowed and a few weapons appeared. As soon as these weapons appeared, a terrifying battle weapon Qi soared into the sky and a vast pressure covered the sky. Every weapon was so bright that even the sun was overshadowed.</p><p>A monarch weapon!</p><p>They were all monarch weapons!</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN clan cultivated the ten thousand soldier scroll and sealed Emperor weapons with earth-shattering power.</p><p>He held a battle sword in his hand and slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword-light and the Halo of light that burst forth from the pill furnace collided fiercely, causing a loud boom to ring out.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void, shrouded in endless halos. He waved his hands and the entire mountain of alchemy furnaces glowed. Halos appeared one after another, as if they had turned into blades of death, and they attacked the WAN family’s martial sovereigns.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few consecutive deafening booms, the WAN clan martial sovereign’s body trembled as he stepped into the void and retreated.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to fight a Martial Emperor and even managed to force him to retreat. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>“Brat, you can control the great array here. You have indeed obtained the inheritance of the great Yan elixir Hall!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s Martial Emperor shouted, his long hair flying in the wind, and his aura was wild.</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat. No wonder Lu Ming was able to fight against a Martial Emperor. It turned out that he was in control of the Grand formation of the Dayan elixir Hall.</p><p>However, it was shocking that he had the guts to fight a martial Supreme.</p><p>An ordinary person would be trembling in fear in front of a Martial Emperor. They would not even dare to breathe loudly and would not even think about fighting a Martial Emperor.</p><p>It would be useless for an ordinary person to control such a formation.</p><p>Lu Ming indeed lived up to his reputation. He was very bold.</p><p>so what if you have a formation? I’ll let you understand what a martial Supreme is. Everyone below a martial Supreme is an ant!</p><p>The WAN clan Martial Emperor roared, and his aura became even more terrifying. A world seemed to have emerged from his body, and a terrifying power spread out from the world and poured into the sovereign weapon.</p><p>The monarch weapons hovered in the air, their power growing more and more terrifying as they pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>the martial sovereign’s world force!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Once a martial sovereign’s world Energy was unleashed, it could crush and destroy everything.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. He was well aware of the power of the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming shouted. He dared to shout at the martial sovereigns. At the same time, the mountain of the alchemy furnace glowed and shot out at an astonishing speed. It attacked the martial sovereigns of the WAN clan in an instant, exceeding the reaction speed of many people.</p><p>These halos kept bombarding the monarch weapons, engaging in a fierce battle with them.</p><p>The Emperor weapon trembled, and the power of the world on it seemed to be scattered.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign let out a long roar, causing the heavens and earth to shake. The power of the world continued to spread out, but he didn’t need to use it. He was forced to retreat continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With every step he took, he stepped on the void, and the void seemed to crack.</p><p>Although the yuan continent’s space was extremely stable, many times more stable than the divine wilderness continent’s, a monarch level expert was too strong. They could already affect space. If they went all out, they could probably tear space apart.</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereigns were no match for him at all, and they were constantly retreating.</p><p>this kid is too bold and reckless. He’s very likely to be from evil spirit. There’s no need to follow any rules when dealing with evil spirit. We must take him down. Brother Wan, I’ll help you!</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, a figure screeched and turned into a huge black Eagle, pouncing at Lu Ming.</p><p>This man was a demon Emperor of the heavenly Bird Palace.</p><p>how shameful. To deal with a junior, you need two emperors to work together, and you even found such a Grand reason. 1 can’t bear it!</p><p>The martial sovereign beside Huang Ling shouted and stepped out. With a palm strike, a Phoenix flew out and pounced at the demon sovereign of the heavenly Bird Palace.</p><p>your Phoenix Palace is always shielding Lu Ming. Have you turned to evil spirit? kill him! break! the demon sovereign of the heavenly Bird Palace shouted. He flapped his wings and shattered the Phoenix condensed by the martial sovereign of the Phoenix Palace like a heavenly blade. At the same time, he did not forget to accuse the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Your mother’s fart!”</p><p>The martial sovereign of the Phoenix Palace cursed. His momentum burst out, and he kept throwing out his palms. The cries of phoenixes rang out, and one after another, phoenixes flew out and fought with the demon sovereign of the heavenly Bird Palace, we’ll settle the score with Phoenix Palace later. We must take Lu Ming down today!</p><p>Another cold voice was heard. A figure stepped out. This person was covered in purple light, which soared into the sky.</p><p>The purple Extreme sect’s Martial Emperor powerhouse.</p><p>“You guys are too much!”</p><p>The divine elephant sect’s martial sovereign said. He took a step forward and appeared in front of the purple pole sect’s martial sovereign.</p><p>your divine elephant sect also wants to interfere. I’m just about to experience the divine elephant sect’s ultimate technique!</p><p>let’s go! the purple Extreme sect Martial Emperor said. Purple light burst forth, forming a terrifying attack that blasted toward the divine elephant sect Martial Emperor.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>die! the Martial Emperor of the divine elephant sect shouted and threw a punch. A group of giant elephants formed and leaped toward the Martial Emperor of the purple pole sect as if they wanted to crush him.</p><p>A few Emperor-Ranked Battles erupted here.</p><p>An Emperor-level battle shook the heavens and earth. The others were all shocked and retreated in a frenzy, afraid that they would be affected.</p><p>you can’t stop him today. Lu Ming must be taken down!</p><p>Another voice was heard. It came from the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower. He roared and transformed into a giant wolf. Like a mountain, he burst out with a violent aura and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, no one stopped him.</p><p>In the Phoenix Palace, the divine elephant sect had helped Lu Ming because of the relationship between Phoenix spirit and Long Chen, which was close to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the other forces had nothing to do with Lu Ming. Of course, they would not help Lu Ming and offend the WAN family, the Sirius tower, and the other major forces.</p><p>how dare you kill the crown Prince of my golden Crow race! You must die!</p><p>The demon Thearch of the Golden Crow clan bellowed and transformed into a huge three-legged golden Crow. Its entire body was covered in blazing divine Sunfire. With a flap of its wings, it pounced at Lu Ming like a golden divine Blade.</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses attacked at the same time to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>The three emperors had joined forces just to take down Lu Ming. Even if Lu Ming was taken down today, or even died in battle, his name would probably shake the ancient Moon Holy Land and be recorded in history.</p><p>Facing the three emperors, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. However, there was a burning flame in his eyes. It was a strong murderous intent.</p><p>He retreated and controlled the Grand Yan formation. Rays of light formed and bombarded the three Emperor-level experts.</p><p>“Don’t let him retreat to the mountain of pill furnaces!”</p><p>die! the WAN family martial sovereign shouted coldly. He controlled his sovereign weapon and struck away the Halos, heading for Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower and the three-legged golden Crow attacked from both sides. The terrifying attack broke through the Halo and approached Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming was still retreating. His speed was getting faster and faster as he approached the mountain of the alchemy furnace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
