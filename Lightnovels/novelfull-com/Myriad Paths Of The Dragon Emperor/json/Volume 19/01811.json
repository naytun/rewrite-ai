He had completely transformed into an unparalleled peerless swordsman.</p><p>...</p><p>the true Emperor humiliated a junior, so I’ll humiliate you too. Kill!</p><p>Uncle Kong shouted, and his eyes were like lightning. He took a step forward, and the heavens and earth shook. Another sword light slashed toward the true Emperor of the Sirius tower.</p><p>The true Emperor from the heavenly Wolf tower was horrified. He retreated frantically and used all his power to resist, but it was all in vain. When the sword light slashed past, the true Emperor from the heavenly Wolf tower followed in the footsteps of the true emperors from the WAN family. His entire body turned into ashes and vanished.</p><p>Another true Emperor had been slain!</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>At this time, the remaining true emperors of the Golden Crow race, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace were almost scared to death. They only had one thought in their minds, and that was to run, as far as possible.</p><p>At this moment, they no longer had any thoughts of killing Lu Ming. They only wanted to save their lives.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s eyes focused. He formed a sword with his finger and slashed at the air.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>In front of the three true emperors, a shocking sword light appeared and cut the void in half. The three true emperors stopped in their tracks and looked terrified.</p><p>“If I want to kill you, do you think you can escape?”</p><p>Uncle Kong said coldly.</p><p>“Senior, please spare my life!”</p><p>The Golden Crow race’s true Emperor cried out. At this moment, he no longer had the arrogance he had before. He had become very well-behaved, like a big Bird that was about to die of illness.</p><p>This was completely out of fear.</p><p>The WAN family’s true emperors and the sky Wolf tower’s true emperors were all killed by the old man with a single slash. It wouldn’t take much effort for the old man to kill them.</p><p>In all four directions, everyone else was silent and could only look at uncle Kong in fear.</p><p>Killing a true Emperor with a single sword strike, what kind of cultivation was this? what realm was this?</p><p>Could it be the great emperor?</p><p>A great emperor was hidden in the great Yan elixir Palace?</p><p>One had to know that there were only a handful of great emperors in the entire Yuan mountain.</p><p>Even if he wasn’t a great emperor, he must be an extremely terrifying existence among true emperors, many people thought.</p><p>The other two true emperors also stopped in their tracks and looked at elder Kong.</p><p>Even with their cultivation, they were completely unable to see through elder Kong’s cultivation level.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The longsword returned to its sheath, and the aura on elder Kong’s body started to withdraw once more, and he became like an ordinary old man.</p><p>Elder Kong’s walking stick was a long sword.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Elder Kong’s words caused the three true emperors to relax.</p><p>“Let me tell you, Lu Ming is already the successor of the Dayan elixir Hall and the current Hall Master of the Dayan elixir Hall!”</p><p>Elder Kong said.</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry. We will not touch a single hair on Lu Ming’s head in the future!”</p><p>The true Emperor of the Golden Crow race said.</p><p>Elder Kong nodded, and his gaze swept across the entire scene and the powerhouses of all the forces. His voice resounded from afar,” “In the future, I won’t interfere in the fights between peers. Even if one of you kills Lu Ming and steals his opportunities, I won’t interfere!”</p><p>however, if some of you old guys make a move against a junior, don’t blame the old guys for being impolite. When the time comes, I’ll make a trip to your sect and stretch my muscles!</p><p>Many people felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>With elder Kong’s battle prowess, if he were to make a trip to any sect, it would be a disaster.</p><p>Elder Kong could even kill a true Emperor with a single sword strike. Although the various major forces had deep foundations and there couldn’t possibly be only one true Emperor, there might even be stronger existences, but they might not be elder Kong’s match.</p><p>At that time, not to mention the younger generation, even Emperor level experts would die.</p><p>This was a threat, a blatant threat. However, the major forces could only accept this threat.</p><p>This was the power of a terrifying expert.</p><p>Why did the experts of the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan not dare to kill the geniuses of the younger generation of the Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect? it was because there were also terrifying experts in the Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect.</p><p>If you killed their heaven’s pride experts, their experts could also kill your heaven’s pride experts. This was the power of the strong.</p><p>And why did the WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, and the other forces dare to send out their experts to kill Lu Ming?</p><p>This was because they knew that Lu Ming did not have any backing. If he was killed, so be it. No expert behind Lu Ming would seek revenge on their juniors.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had it, all the forces had to be wary.</p><p>“Senior, are you really not going to interfere in a battle between two peers?”</p><p>The true Emperor of the Golden Crow race asked,</p><p>“I’m a man of my word. If Lu Ming can’t win in a battle between peers and is killed, then he’s useless. But I’ll still say the same thing. If it’s your seniors or even Emperor-level powerhouses, I won’t hold back either. Now, all of you can get lost!”</p><p>Elder Kong’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint, and then he waved his hand.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Golden Crow race’s true Emperor let out a loud cry and turned into a ray of golden light, flying away at extreme speed. The other members of the Golden Crow race also left the place one after another.</p><p>The purple Extreme sect, heavenly Bird Palace, and other sects also flickered and left.</p><p>This time, the great Yan elixir Palace’s appearance had finally come to an end, but the storm it had set off was far from over. It would shake the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was the only protagonist. Because of Lu Ming, several major forces had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Especially the Skywolf tower and the WAN family, their losses were even more shocking.</p><p>The WAN clan had lost a true Emperor, and the Skywolf tower had lost a void Emperor and a true Emperor. Even a powerful force like the ancient Moon Holy Land could not bear such a loss.</p><p>Anyone who could become a monarch was a peerless genius.</p><p>The heavenly spiritual body was said to have the potential to become an Emperor, but that was all. It was still very difficult to become an Emperor.</p><p>Moreover, he was a true Emperor!</p><p>&Nbsp; ancient Moon Holy Land was a huge force, and they definitely had true emperors, and more than one at that. But those were accumulated over the long years, and there definitely wouldn’t be too many. Losing one would have a huge impact on their strength.</p><p>Not long after, almost all the forces had left, leaving only Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and a few other forces behind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Huang Ling walked towards the furnace Mountain and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“I’m fine, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, but his face was a little pale. His body trembled slightly and he almost lost his balance.</p><p>Previously, he had been attacked by the WAN family’s true emperors and was already severely injured.</p><p>“Huang Ling, let’s let Lu Ming recuperate first. We’ll visit him another day!”</p><p>Long Chen also walked over and said.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming. You should recuperate first. We’ll come and visit you another day!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling. Then, she left with Long Chen, Phoenix Palace, and divine elephant sect.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at uncle Kong.</p><p>Palace Master, protecting you is this old servant’s duty. However, there are countless experts in the world. These forces in ancient Moon Holy Land are not as simple as they look on the surface. Their foundations are very deep, and they all have terrifying existences guarding them!</p><p>“As for the other Holy Lands, they also have many experts. The road ahead will be even longer, and the hall Master will have to walk it on his own. This old servant will not interfere in the competition between the younger generation. The hall Master will have to face it himself!”</p><p>Uncle Kong said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
