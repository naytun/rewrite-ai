His cultivation was also in the great sage perfection realm.</p><p>In fact, many top geniuses were in the great sage perfection realm.</p><p>After all, very, very few of the younger generation could reach the absolute Saint realm. It wasn’t easy to break through this barrier.</p><p>Of course, there were strong and weak people in the same realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng stepped onto the battle stage and made his move immediately. His fists continued to blast out. In the sky, there were huge meteorites, carrying purple flames, smashing towards Yu Shu.</p><p>The White flames around Yu Shu’s body condensed into battle swords and slashed out, splitting the meteorites one by one.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the rumbling sounds were more intense than before.</p><p>Xiao Mucheng’s combat power was stronger than the heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa. His magical power was more profound, at least seventy percent, and its power was very shocking.</p><p>The two of them had exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>The fighting ring was filled with white and purple flames that were fighting against each other.</p><p>However, after a hundred moves, Xiao Mucheng was still no match and gradually fell into a disadvantage.</p><p>Another hundred moves passed, and Xiao Mucheng was blasted off the fighting ring by Yu Shu.</p><p>Xiao Mucheng was also defeated.</p><p>As the only disciple of the sacred Hall, his combat strength was indeed shocking.</p><p>“Great sage in the great circle, who else is up for a fight?”</p><p>go! Yu Shu shouted. Her eyes were like lightning as she scanned the people of the purple flame villa.</p><p>The people of the purple flame villa were silent.</p><p>Even their leader, Xiao Mucheng, had been defeated. If the others went up, they would only be asking for humiliation.</p><p>hehe, you’re really weak. Senior brother Yu Shu isn’t the strongest among the great saints in the great circle of the Holy Temple!</p><p>Someone from the Holy Temple sneered.</p><p>This made the purple flame villa and Ouyang Wushuang’s hearts sink.</p><p>Yu Shu was the only great sage in the great circle in the Holy Temple, but she was not the strongest? How was that possible?</p><p>Yu Shu’s combat strength was almost invincible among those of the same level, unless it was a King body that controlled the laws of the king path or a superior-grade heavenly spirit body. However, these people were not cabbages that could be found easily.</p><p>In the sole divine temple, there were great sage Great Perfection cultivators who were even stronger than Yu Shu. No wonder the sole divine temple was so arrogant. No wonder Ouyang Wuji was so confident.</p><p>“Ninth brother, I’m sure you’ve seen how strong he is!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said indifferently.</p><p>“The sparring has just begun, what’s the rush, sixth brother?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Oh? Then let’s continue. Since no one dares to fight a great sage in the Great Perfection realm, then let’s fight a great sage peak!” Ouyang Wuji coldly snorted.</p><p>Yu Shu got off the battle platform. Another person from the Supreme sacred Hall stepped onto the battle platform, showing that his cultivation was at the peak of the Supreme Saint.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji wanted to completely crush Ouyang Wushuang’s side at all levels, peak of the great saint realm. Who wants to fight?”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the sacred Hall was full of confidence and arrogance.</p><p>The faces of the purple flame villa’s elites were all very serious. Finally, a peak Supreme Saint stepped onto the fighting stage.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was no match for the heaven’s favorite from the only divine temple. Just like before, it was a one-sided battle. After a few dozen moves, the heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa was defeated.</p><p>Next, the purple flame villa sent another heaven’s favorite, but he was still no match for them.</p><p>Great saints in the great circle and great saints in the peak were all crushed.</p><p>ninth brother, I’ve said it before. Even if you participate in the test, you won’t have a chance. Why don’t you come and help me?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji continued.</p><p>“Only two levels have been carried out. The great sage great mastery realm hasn’t been fought yet. Sixth brother, you’re speaking too early!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Do great sages still need to fight? People of this realm are almost useless in this test!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji revealed a disdainful smile.</p><p>This time, the heaven’s favorites they invited were the best of the best. Not only did they have strong spiritual bodies, but their super powers were also profound. Their cultivations were at least at the peak of the great saint realm, and most of them were at the Great Perfection of the great saint realm.</p><p>The great mastery of the Supreme Saint realm had no effect on the battle.</p><p>“How would you know if you haven’t fought?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Since ninth brother insists on this? I happen to have a great sage Great Perfection heaven’s pride on my side. I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>After that, a Supreme Saint from the Supreme sacred Hall stepped onto the battle platform.</p><p>“Great sage great mastery, who wants to fight?”</p><p>The man shouted.</p><p>The geniuses of the purple flame villa looked at each other. There was no one in the great sage realm among them.</p><p>“I’ll fight this battle!”</p><p>Long Chen stood up and stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>Long Chen’s cultivation base was the great sage.</p><p>“Ninth brother, I heard that you asked for help from a few heaven’s favorites in ancient Moon Temple, could it be them? His cultivation is a little low!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji laughed with a hint of mockery.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites he invited from the ancient Moon Holy Land were all in the great circle of the Supreme Saint realm, such as mo lang and the Golden Crow second Prince. Although they were not as strong as the heaven’s favorites from the only holy temple, their battle power was not to be underestimated.</p><p>“The deciding factor of one’s combat strength isn’t just one’s cultivation!” Ouyang Wushuang replied indifferently.</p><p>“Oh, really? Not everyone has ninth brother’s talent!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji laughed.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Long Chen stood with his hands behind his back. He had an extraordinary bearing, but in the eyes of the only person from the temple, he was not happy.</p><p>“Do you still need me to make a move? I advise you to get the hell out of here!”</p><p>The only chosen from the sacred temple spoke arrogantly.</p><p>“If you can take three of my moves, I’ll admit defeat!”</p><p>Long Chen said indifferently.</p><p>“What? Three moves? Hahaha!”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the sacred Hall burst into laughter. Not only him, but the others below the battle stage were also laughing.</p><p>The Supreme talent of the only sacred temple was almost invincible among those of the same level. Now, Long Chen said that he would defeat the Supreme talent of the only sacred temple in three moves. Wasn’t this ridiculous?</p><p>“Ninth brother, your friend is really…”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji was about to sneer at him, but he stopped mid-sentence.</p><p>The trumpeting of an elephant resounded through the sky. One of Long Chen’s arms swelled rapidly. He took a step forward, shaking the fighting ring. Then, he threw a punch at the Supreme sacred Hall’s genius.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed, the sky would shake and the air would evaporate, forming a terrifying vacuum.</p><p>The terrifying power caused the heaven’s favorite from the only sacred temple to turn pale.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the sacred Hall used all his strength to resist, but it was useless.</p><p>Long Chen’s fist force blasted out, and all the defenses were shattered.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert from the sole divine temple let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying. He fell heavily off the fighting stage. Half of his body had been smashed and he had almost been beaten to death.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites from the only temple all stood up. Their auras were filled with disbelief..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
