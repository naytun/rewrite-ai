Their direction was exactly the same as the sword source that Lu Ming and the others were chasing.</p><p>...</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The two of them were puzzled.</p><p>Why did the sword source fly on its own? it wouldn’t have been a big deal if there was only one, but he had seen a few now.</p><p>The two of them continued to chase for a while, getting deeper and deeper into the sword tomb. At this time, they saw more sword sources flying towards the sword tomb. Behind some sword sources, there were people chasing them.</p><p>“No, Qiu Yue, wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and frowned.</p><p>There was definitely something strange going on in the depths of the sword tomb. Otherwise, how could so many sword sources fly in the same direction?</p><p>Once an abnormality appeared in a place like this, it was either the birth of a rare treasure or the arrival of a crisis.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are we going to give chase or not?”</p><p>Qiu Yue asked.</p><p>She also felt that something was wrong and continued to pursue, not knowing what she would face.</p><p>let’s not go in too deep first. Let’s see if we can find the astral treasure Lotus outside!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded. After that, the two of them didn’t go any deeper. They started searching around the outer area.</p><p>From time to time, they would see the sword source whistling past and flying toward the depths of the sword tomb. They would also see figures flying through the air in pursuit of the sword source.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest were lucky, they could intercept one or two sword sources halfway.</p><p>“Lu Ming, look, that’s …”</p><p>Suddenly, Qiu Yue exclaimed and pointed to a cliff in front of them.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in that direction. On the broken cliff, there was a lotus flower.</p><p>It was as white as Jade and crystal clear.</p><p>The strange thing was that the petals of the Lotus were slender and sharp, like divine swords.</p><p>The Grand astral treasure Lotus!</p><p>Lu Ming had seen it in the records of the Dayan elixir Palace and recognized it at a glance.</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. He had really worn out his iron shoes in a long search but found it without any effort.</p><p>They had searched for a long time before, but they hadn’t found any trace of the Grand astral treasure Lotus. They hadn’t expected to find it when they stopped chasing and searched the outer region.</p><p>“The Grand astral treasure Lotus is extremely spiritual and can escape on its own. Qiuyue, you stay here and block it. I’ll go and take it down!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue before casting the divine breath spell and flying towards the astral treasure Lotus silently.</p><p>When he was a certain distance away, dense runes appeared on Lu Ming’s palm. He pressed his palm on the ground and the runes spread along the ground towards the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>He wanted to use the array Dao laws to seal the Grand astral treasure Lotus and prevent it from escaping.</p><p>However, just as the array Dao laws were about to approach the Grand Sun treasure Lotus, it moved. It turned into a white light, like a white sword light, and broke through the sky, flying into the depths of the sword tomb.</p><p>“Not good, we’ve been discovered. Qiu Yue, chase after him!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue. Then, he used his movement technique and chased after the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast, and so was the astral treasure Lotus. It was no slower than the sword sources, and Lu Ming couldn’t catch up to it at all.</p><p>this Grand astral treasure Lotus is too sharp. We were so careful, but we were still discovered!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only pursue with all his might.</p><p>Qiu Yue followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>The direction that the astral treasure Lotus was running in was the same as the direction of the sword sources.</p><p>Endless land flew under his feet. He chased for a few hours, but he still couldn’t catch up to the Grand astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could not help but miss bubbles. If he had bubbles, with the speed of the space-time law and the sealing power, it would not be difficult to capture the astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>After chasing for a while, Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p>The scene in front of him made his heart tremble.</p><p>In front of him was an abyss. Above the abyss, countless sword sources gathered together, dancing continuously. The swords hummed continuously, and the sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>There were simply too many of them. They were densely packed together, and it was impossible to tell how many sword sources there were.</p><p>Around the abyss, there were many figures standing in the air. At a glance, there were no less than hundreds of people.</p><p>These people surrounded the area, but they didn’t take any action to seize the sword source.</p><p>This was because the scene was too strange. Countless sword sources gathering in the sky above the abyss was unheard of.</p><p>There must be something wrong with this abnormal situation, so no one acted rashly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Grand astral treasure Lotus turned into a sword-light and disappeared into the abyss.</p><p>“We’re in trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>He had finally found the Grand astral treasure Lotus, but unfortunately, he hadn’t been able to take it. He had only been able to watch as it escaped into the abyss.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue stood outside, sizing up the area in front of them. They did not act rashly.</p><p>Many people looked at the endless source of swords with burning eyes and greed.</p><p>With so many sword sources, if he refined them, how much would his cultivation improve?</p><p>However, the situation was strange. Although everyone was greedy, they still maintained their rationality and restrained themselves.</p><p>“Brat, it’s you!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar was heard. The sound of the air being torn apart could be heard and a few figures flashed toward Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>“So it’s these few guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and a cold smile appeared at the corners of his lips.</p><p>The person who flickered over was Wu Chu. At this moment, there were only two people left beside him. It was obvious that they had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The three of them surrounded Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>brat, you dare to betray us? I’ll let you die a miserable death!</p><p>Chief Wu glared at Lu Ming furiously, his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>Previously, because of Lu Ming, not only did they not get the sword source, but they also had an intense fight with the other party. In the end, many people died in the battle, and only the three of them managed to break through the siege.</p><p>They naturally blamed everything on Lu Ming and the rest. If Lu Ming and the rest had followed his plan, would they have suffered such losses?</p><p>“Betray you? What a joke, I joined your team only to cooperate!”</p><p>and you used us as bait from the start. Do you think I would be so stupid as to throw my life away for you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly with a strong sense of disdain.</p><p>“The weak should have the awareness of the weak!”</p><p>Wu Chu said coldly.</p><p>“Weaklings? Hehe, you’re already so old, but you’re only at the absolute Saint realm. Do you think you’re very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless.</p><p>“Strong or not, it’s enough to kill you!”</p><p>Wu Chu took a step forward, and his absolute Saint in the great circle was unleashed. His withered claws grabbed at Lu Ming with a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with chief Wu’s claw.</p><p>With a loud boom, the two of them were pushed back slightly.</p><p>“You … How is that possible?” Wu Chu’s eyes suddenly widened, filled with disbelief.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming could block his attack?</p><p>It was unbelievable that a great saint in the great circle could block the attack of an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>The others in the surroundings were also shocked.</p><p>that’s the law of chaos. He’s a son of chaos!</p><p>Someone exclaimed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
