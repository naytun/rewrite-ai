With one palm, a large number of people were slapped away. As long as they were killed, they would turn into rays of light and fly into the sky, disappearing from the world.</p><p>From the front and back, roars could be heard as an Azure Dragon and a White Tiger rushed over.</p><p>“Four symbols formation!”</p><p>Frenzied sword’s face turned pale.</p><p>The four symbols formation was a terrifying formation. When a great army joined forces, they would form the four symbols of heaven and earth. When they gathered together, their power would be extremely terrifying. It was much stronger than the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation.</p><p>When the four divisions appeared, they completely separated Ouyang Wushuang’s Army. They were cut into pieces and it was difficult for them to gather together.</p><p>“Set up the formation, set up the formation!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” sky tiger roar! flying chaos roared as the separated Army set up the sky tiger roar formation. Instantly, sky Tigers appeared, and there were more than ten of them.</p><p>However, the Army had been split up, each fighting their own battles. The heavenly Tiger heaven roaring formation that had been set up was much weaker, and was completely suppressed by the four symbols formation.</p><p>The Phoenix spread its wings and clawed down. A heaven Tiger was crushed. The soldiers who formed the heaven Tiger formation screamed one after another. Many of them were killed and turned into light before disappearing. Even more people were injured, but the formation had been broken, so it was even more difficult to stop it. The Phoenix opened its mouth, and terrifying flames spread out. Large groups of soldiers were turned into ashes in the flames, turning into light and disappearing.</p><p>On the other side, the Azure Dragon, the Black Tortoise, and The White Tiger were also doing the same. They were completely crushing and continuously harvesting lives.</p><p>For a time, dense light shot into the sky, extremely bright.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Frenzied flight roared and brought his men to charge forward. Unfortunately, it was useless. They were blocked in all directions and could only be killed.</p><p>In less than half an hour, the 25000-man army had been completely annihilated, and it was the same for frenzied flight, who turned into a ray of light and disappeared.</p><p>On the other hand, Ouyang wudao’s Army had only lost less than two thousand men.</p><p>“Reporting to the first Prince, Ouyang Wushuang is not in the Army!”</p><p>Someone reported to the first Prince.</p><p>“How many people did you kill?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao asked.</p><p>“More than twenty-five thousand!”</p><p>hahaha, good. Even if ninth brother isn’t dead, he’s crippled. There arc only a few thousand people left. He can only be an audience for this round!</p><p>Ouyang wudao laughed heartily.</p><p>There would definitely be experts from the shenyuan Empire paying attention to the formation world. In this battle, he had annihilated Ouyang Wushuang’s twenty-five thousand troops and held the initiative. Even if they did not fight, he would still be able to obtain victory in this stalemate.</p><p>However, he wasn’t going to let this stalemate continue. He was Ouyang wudao, and he wanted to win beautifully. He wanted to use a crushing method to obtain the position of Crown Prince and shock the entire shenyuan Empire, the Army will rest and reorganize. Then, we will set off and take down Ouyang Wushuang’s camp!</p><p>Ouyang wudao ordered.</p><p>The powerhouses who were paying attention to this place would definitely give them a score. The greater the advantage they had, the higher the score would be.</p><p>However, he did not notice that two figures were watching them from a distance. They were Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>the plan is going smoothly. Next, Ouyang wudao will definitely send his Army to occupy our camp. Let’s go back and retreat!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded and the two of them left.</p><p>As soon as they returned to the camp, Ouyang Wushuang gathered the remaining five thousand soldiers and left the camp. They headed to the edge of the camp. There was a Valley there that was very well hidden. If the five thousand soldiers entered, they would not be discovered without careful inspection.</p><p>In a temporary cave abode in the valley, Ouyang Wushuang, Lu Ming, and the others gathered together again to discuss the military situation.</p><p>“I told you that plan wouldn’t work, but the ninth Prince didn’t listen to me. Now, the 25000 soldiers have all been wiped out. We’re going to lose this battle!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sneered in disdain.</p><p>that’s right. We had good intentions, but the ninth Prince refused to listen and used Lu Ming’s plan instead. Now that he has suffered a crushing defeat, who should be responsible?”</p><p>this round was originally our chance. Our strength is almost the same. If we win this round, we will have a chance in the next few rounds. If the first Prince wins the first round, we will have almost no chance of winning with the help of the talents of the Daluo heaven sect!</p><p>The paragons of the purple flame villa spoke one after another, mocking and ridiculing Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s not even the end yet, and you’re already so sure that we’re going to lose?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at them and spoke indifferently.</p><p>“There are only about 5000 people left. How can we compete with the other two sides? And we even lost our barracks. If nothing goes wrong, we’ll definitely be last in this round!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sneered.</p><p>“Oh? Since that’s the case, why don’t we have a bet?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Bet? How to bet? What are we betting on?”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng’s eyes flashed as he asked.</p><p>“I bet that we will win this round. If I lose, I will become your subordinate and listen to your orders. How about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>These words made the others reveal shocked expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming actually bet on himself.</p><p>The eyes of the purple flame villa’s paragons were filled with a fiery light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was obvious to all. He could control the Laws of Chaos and was extremely powerful. If he were to grow up in the future, he would definitely become a terrifying expert.</p><p>If such a person were to listen to them, it would be an irresistible temptation.</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng directly agreed.</p><p>“Don’t agree so quickly. I haven’t told you the conditions for your loss. If you lose, you have to obey me. At the very least, for the next fifty years, you have to obey me unconditionally. What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We won’t lose at all!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng said.</p><p>nonsense. Since it’s a bet, there must be a winner and a loser. Both of us have to take a blood oath. If we lose, we have to listen to each other!</p><p>Lu Ming added.</p><p>The eyes of the paragons from the purple flame villa flickered.</p><p>Finally, they reached a consensus and nodded to each other.</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng said.</p><p>They really could not think of any other way to win this round. From the current situation, they were definitely going to lose. They could not be a match for Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>If he could get Lu Ming’s loyalty, why not?</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and the people of the purple flame villa made a blood oath and set the bet.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. The geniuses of the purple flame villa were all very strong. Each of them had a medium-grade heavenly spiritual body. They had profound potential and would not be weak in the future.</p><p>Most importantly, if he could get these geniuses to work for him, it would be the same as having the purple flame villa in his hands..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
