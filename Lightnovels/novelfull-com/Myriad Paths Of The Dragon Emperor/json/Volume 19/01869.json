However, before Lu Ming went to the ancient sun sanctuary, he used the Dayan elixir furnace to refine Xue ningxin’s spirit body, making it a low-grade heavenly spirit body.</p><p>alright, the test is over. You can all join the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Wait for me here for a moment!</p><p>After the middle-aged man finished speaking, he turned around and left. Not long after, he returned.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, more than ten Jade tokens appeared in the air and flew toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>this is your identity token. Take it. In the future, you will be representing the people of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Also, the yuan mountain sacred Academy is very large and has a wide area. Therefore, you can choose your residence at will. As long as no one lives on the mountain peaks you saw before, you can choose!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, teacher!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the group received it and cupped their fists to express their gratitude.</p><p>MN, there’s one more thing I want to remind you all. In the yuan mountain sacred Academy, you all can not fight, but you can not kill. You can not cripple the cultivation of your opponents. The rest is up to you all!</p><p>The middle-aged man warned.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded.</p><p>The geniuses who joined the yuan mountain sacred Academy were all peak geniuses from all over the world. At the very least, they all had the heavenly spiritual body and the potential to become monarchs. If there was no restriction on killing, with so many geniuses clashing, the losses would be heavy.</p><p>However, there was no restriction on fighting. This could motivate many geniuses and give them pressure, forcing them to improve.</p><p>“Alright, you guys can go!”</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand. Lu Ming and the rest took their leave and left the place.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a voice transmission to Long Chen and Huang Ling.</p><p>Not long after, a few figures flickered over. It was Huang Ling and Long Chen. There were also a few familiar faces-mu Qingxue and ye Dongfang of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>The few of them greeted Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally here. Who are they?”</p><p>Huang Ling smiled as she looked at Huang Li and the others with a look of surprise.</p><p>“Where are you guys staying? we can talk as we walk!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Some of our acquaintances live on the same mountain peak. 1’11 Take You There!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling. Immediately, the group headed towards the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Not long after, they arrived at a mountain peak. On this mountain peak, there were many courtyards. When Lu Ming and the others arrived, many figures flew out.</p><p>These people were all geniuses from Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and mu Qingxue’s sect. They had a good relationship and all lived on this mountain peak.</p><p>Everyone greeted Lu Ming and the rest. Then, they landed in a courtyard. Lu Ming also introduced desolate force and the rest.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not mention that desolate li and the others were from the desolate race. After all, the desolate race had not yet come into being.</p><p>“You’re also in control of the extreme limit laws?”</p><p>Huang Li looked at Long Chen, his eyes filled with a strong desire to fight. His body erupted with extreme nomological laws, filled with terrifying power.</p><p>A powerful aura erupted from Long Chen’s body as well. He stared at desolate and circulated his nomological laws as much as he could, revealing his battle intent.</p><p>it’s a pity that your cultivation is still a little lacking. When you break through to the great saint perfection, we’ll have a good fight!</p><p>Desolate li licked his lips, his battle intent growing stronger.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!” Long Chen’s eyes were also burning with passion.</p><p>The king path laws were the top laws of the world. In an ordinary era, a King body was extremely rare.</p><p>It was only in the golden age of today that the situation of Kings fighting for hegemony would appear.</p><p>However, it was rare for two or more people to appear in the same generation with the same King physique.</p><p>Long Chen and desolate power both controlled the laws of extremity. When they met, there was no way they would not fight. Furthermore, the two of them were fighting with the same King physique, which was extremely beneficial to their cultivation.</p><p>“This big guy actually has a King physique too!”</p><p>In the Phoenix Palace, the other paragons of the divine elephant sect looked at Huang Li in shock.</p><p>Long Chen and desolate looked at each other, then retracted their auras.</p><p>Everyone chatted for a while more. Lu Ming mainly asked about the situation of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy are beyond our imagination. Not only are the geniuses of the nine great Holy Lands gathered here, but there are also many geniuses of Emperor-ranked forces. Even those ancient clans that have been hiding in seclusion have also sent geniuses to join the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“An ancient race?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and thought of the desolate race.</p><p>those ancient clans are called the ancient clans. They are forces that have existed for countless years. They have existed since ancient times. Many of them are not in the nine sacred lands, but in their own small worlds. They have extremely deep foundations, and no one knows how strong they are!</p><p>1 don’t know why, but this time, many geniuses from the ancient clans have appeared. Their talent and strength are all extremely shocking, and there are quite a number of King physiques!</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“The ancient race?”</p><p>The battle intent in Huang Li, Huang Yuan, and company’s eyes became even stronger.</p><p>it seems like this Yuan mountain sacred Academy is really a gathering place. All the geniuses of the nine great Holy Lands have gathered here. There’s even a genius from the ancient race. Interesting!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Feng Ling, Long Chen, get out here!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from outside.</p><p>“It’s mo lang and the others!”</p><p>The faces of Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others turned ugly.</p><p>“Damn it, these guys really don’t want to give up!”</p><p>Someone growled.</p><p>“Feng Ling, Long Chen, get out here!”</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have a seat. I’ll settle it!”</p><p>Long Chen stepped out of the courtyard.</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>Phoenix spirit followed him out. Some of the paragons from Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect also followed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not get up. Instead, he spread out his spiritual sense and ‘saw’ everything that was happening outside.</p><p>Outside, mo lang, the Golden Crow second Prince, and some other heaven’s favorites, a total of seven or eight people, were all top heaven’s favorites from the ancient Moon sanctuary. They stood high in the sky, looking down at Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the others.</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, have you made your decision? our patience is limited!</p><p>Mo lang sneered.</p><p>you want us to join you? impossible! Get lost!</p><p>Long Chen berated.</p><p>reject us? Hmph, you should know the consequences. The wind race wants you to join them because they think highly of you. Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow was enveloped in the divine fire of the great sun, and his eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>“Don’t you understand the human language? Get lost!”</p><p>Long Chen shouted, and a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>During this time, Long Chen’s cultivation had also made a breakthrough, reaching the peak of the great saint realm. He was not far from the great saint perfection realm. Obviously, he had made great progress in the past few months.</p><p>Long Chen stepped on the air and headed towards mo lang and the others, causing their expressions to change.</p><p>With Long Chen’s talent and his cultivation at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm, his combat power was amazing. They were no match for him at all..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
