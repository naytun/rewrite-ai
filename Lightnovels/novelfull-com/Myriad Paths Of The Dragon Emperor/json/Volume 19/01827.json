The chaotic laws circulated and he threw a punch. The terrifying fist force whistled and destroyed the opponent’s large hand as if it was a piece of rotten wood.</p><p>...</p><p>The face of the heaven’s favorite from the sole sacred Hall sank as he shouted coldly,”You have some ability. Let’s see how many moves you can take!”</p><p>The other party waved his palm and the law of earth in the sky circulated, forming mountains that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said indifferently. He took a step forward and rushed toward his opponent like a bolt of lightning. At the same time, he threw a punch. A ray of fist radiance pierced through the air and swept away the mountains. The terrifying fist force did not stop and continued to blast toward the genius of the only holy temple.</p><p>The fist force was unstoppable, as if it was pressing down on the entire world.</p><p>The other party’s expression changed drastically. The law of earth circulated, setting up layers of defense in front of him.</p><p>However, it was useless. Lu Ming’s fist force crushed all the defenses.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the only sacred Hall spat out a mouthful of blood as his body was sent flying far away, landing on the fighting ring.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite at the peak of the great saint realm in the temple was defeated by Lu Ming so easily. It was as if he had swept away all obstacles.</p><p>How could a person in the minor mastery of the great sage realm have such amazing combat strength?</p><p>The expressions of the other heaven’s favorites from the sacred temple were dark.</p><p>As for mo lang, the Golden Crow second Prince, the ancient Moon Holy Land geniuses, and the purple flame villa geniuses, they all had complicated expressions.</p><p>They were well aware of Lu Ming’s combat strength. They were not surprised by this result.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The young man who had sent Lu Ming flying with a single palm on the street widened his eyes in disbelief at the scene.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming able to be sent flying by his palm? Why was his combat strength so terrifying now?</p><p>haha, sixth brother, I’ve said before, cultivation has never represented combat power!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang laughed.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face darkened and he did not say anything.</p><p>Previously, when Feng Ling and Long Chen were able to defeat the genius of the one and only divine temple, it was already a surprise. But now, Lu Ming was able to defeat the genius of the one and only divine temple, who was two levels higher than him. Even he found it unbelievable.</p><p>Supreme Saint realm. If any of you want to come up and fight, you can!</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the fighting ring, his voice spreading in all directions.</p><p>But this time, no one laughed or mocked him.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had just used his combat strength to prove that he had the ability.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A voice was heard. Then, a figure stepped into the air and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Yu Shu!</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Yu kun was a great saint in the great circle. He had defeated all the great saints in the purple flame villa with his powerful combat strength.</p><p>It could be said that this person’s combat power was definitely the best in the great saint perfection level. In a battle of the same level, he was almost invincible without the king physique.</p><p>Now, he was going to fight Lu Ming, who was only in the great sage minor mastery.</p><p>Many people were very curious. Could Lu Ming fight with Yu Shu?</p><p>although Lu Ming is strong, he’s not Yu kun’s match. I’ve heard of a great sage in the lower tier fighting a great sage in the Great Perfection realm. However, I’ve never heard of a great sage in the Great Perfection realm fighting a prodigy like Yu kun!</p><p>that’s right. Even the Son of God can’t do that. The difference in cultivation is too big!</p><p>The only heaven’s favorites from the sacred Hall were discussing.</p><p>This time, even mo lang, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, and the proud Children of Heaven of the purple flame villa thought that Lu Ming did not have a high chance of winning.</p><p>Although Lu Ming could kill a heaven’s favorite like Wan Zhengyang, Wan Zhengyang’s cultivation base was also in the great saint perfection, but he was definitely not Yu Shu’s match.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yu Shu’s body was covered in white flames. The temperature was shockingly high. The flames formed a saber and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s chaotic laws circulated all over his body as he used the prison-suppressing heavenly art. His palm was like a blade as he slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud explosion, the power of fire spread across half of the fighting ring. Then, a figure was seen retreating seven or eight steps before he could stand firm.</p><p>That figure was Yu Shu, while Lu Ming did not move an inch.</p><p>“Yu Shu has been repelled!”</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Could it be that even Lian Qi was not Lu Ming’s match?</p><p>the laws he controls seem to be the Laws of Chaos!</p><p>Someone suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>that’s right. The light of chaos is very similar to the legendary law of chaos. Is this person the son of chaos, one of the sons of heaven? ”</p><p>it should be. Otherwise, it can’t be so powerful!</p><p>I didn’t expect the son of chaos to appear here!</p><p>Many people could tell that Lu Ming controlled the Laws of Chaos. They immediately started a heated discussion.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face turned even colder. He did not expect Ouyang Wushuang to know a son of chaos.</p><p>ninth brother, you have a wide network. You actually know a son of chaos!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s voice was filled with jealousy.</p><p>Of course, he was jealous. Huang Ling and Long Chen, who were invited by Ouyang Wuji, had mastered the king path law. Lu Ming, on the other hand, had mastered one of the ten strongest laws. Although such a heaven’s favorite’s cultivation base was still weak now, he would definitely be extremely terrifying in the future.</p><p>Why didn’t he know such a powerful heaven’s favorite?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yu Shu took a step back and growled in a low voice. Her face turned even gloomier.</p><p>The sole divine temple was known as the one and only in the world. However, he was forced to retreat by Lu Ming even though his cultivation level was so much higher. It was unbearable.</p><p>The flames on his body burned even more fiercely. The White flames danced and twisted the space.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze moved away from Yu Shu and looked at the one and only divine temple, then at Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue was also sizing Lu Ming up curiously as if she did not know him at all.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I’m lu Ming. I’m your young master. Do you still remember me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Young master?”</p><p>His words made Qiu Yue frown, as if she was in deep thought.</p><p>“Fanatic, How dare you!”</p><p>“This guy is taking advantage of Junior Sister Qiuyue again!”</p><p>“Senior brother Yu Shu, teach him a good lesson!”</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert from the sole divine temple shouted unhappily.</p><p>“Raging flames and storm slash!”</p><p>At this moment, Yu Shu roared. The flames all over his body condensed into a huge saber. He slashed hundreds of times in an instant. The blazing Saber Light swept out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This was Yu kun’s Divine Art, and its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pointed a finger. A huge chaos finger of tribulation formed and shot toward Yu Chan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The finger of chaos tribulation was like the finger of a God. With one point, all the saber beams were shattered. The terrifying force crushed toward Yu Shu. Yu Shu retreated all the way to the edge of the fighting ring before he stopped. His body trembled slightly and he was almost blown off the fighting ring by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze never once fell on Yu Shu. He was still staring at Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Qiuyue, it’s been more than ten years since we last met. Do you still remember master and Madam, my father Lu Yuntian, and my mother Li Ping? they all miss you very much!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
