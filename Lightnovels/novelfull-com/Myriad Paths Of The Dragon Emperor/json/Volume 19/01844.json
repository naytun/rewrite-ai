Why can’t I remember anything? why?”‘</p><p>Qiu Yue mumbled to herself. The confusion in her eyes grew stronger and stronger. Finally, her face revealed a pained expression.</p><p>“Why? Why? I’m going to ask my master. I’m going to ask my master …”</p><p>Qiu Yue suddenly shouted and flew up into the sky. She broke through the layers of formations and left the place in a flash.</p><p>“Junior Sister, you should die …”</p><p>Yu Shu of the sole divine temple shouted angrily.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I will definitely find out what happened to you.”</p><p>Lu Ming s gaze was very cold. The wound on his shoulder was squirming rapidly and healing rapidly.</p><p>Qiu Yue had absorbed most of the energy earlier, so his injuries were not serious. With the strength of Lu Ming’s spirit body, he had basically recovered in a few breaths.</p><p>Lu Ming s gaze shifted to the bubbles. He then took a step forward and dashed toward the bubbles like lightning.</p><p>Runes appeared and attacks were launched at Lu Ming, but they were all broken by him.</p><p>“Get lost!11</p><p>Lu Ming approached him and activated the chaotic finger of tribulation. He pointed a huge finger at the Daluo heaven sect’s Paragon with an amazing momentum.</p><p>Several talents of the Daluo heaven sect joined forces to resist, but they were still not able to resist and were blown away by Lu Ming.</p><p>With that, rhe encirclement was broken, and with a flash, Paopao charged out of the encirclement.</p><p>bubble, go and get the flag. Leave these people to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>With a flash, Paopao charged towards the peak of the mountain.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Baimu shouted.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of them. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared one after another, suppressing the group of Daluo heaven sect’s talents.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Each of Lu Ming’s attacks weighed hundreds of millions of catties and had the power to suppress the heavens. The paragons of the Daluo heaven sect were sent flying one by one, blood spilling from their mouths.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Bai mu charged towards Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Bai MU’s spiritual body was a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body, and his combat power was far above other heaven’s favorites of the same level. For example, Wan Zhengyang, mo lang, and the Golden Crow second Prince, they would probably be easily crushed by Bai mu.</p><p>Before Lu Ming’s breakthrough in cultivation, he might not have been able to defeat Bai mu.</p><p>However, a few days ago, Lu Ming had a breakthrough in his cultivation and his combat strength had increased greatly. After exchanging a few blows with Bai mu, Bai MU’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat seven to eight steps.</p><p>the son of chaos is indeed astonishingly strong!</p><p>Bai MU’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming s fists kept punching out, and pieces of illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared, suppressing the talents of the Daluo heaven sect and blocking their way.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a flash, Paopao’s figure was about to fly up to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Ouyang wudao bellowed. His eyes were bloodshot, unable to accept this fact.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji felt the same way. He was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood. He never thought that he and Ouyang wudao couldn’t stop Ouyang Wushuang even when they joined forces.</p><p>They were extremely unwilling but they could not stop it. They could only watch as the bubble approached the flag quickly.</p><p>Then, bubbles grabbed the flag with both hands and pulled it out.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji’s hearts sank as well.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the geniuses of the purple flame villa were ecstatic.</p><p>With the flag in hand, this round of competition was over.</p><p>The crowd retreated and stopped the battle.</p><p>Ouyang wudao”s gaze was extremely gloomy as he looked at Lu Ming and bubbles.</p><p>In the second and third round of the assessment, he had completely lost to Lu Ming and Paopao. If it were not for them, Ouyang Wushuang would not have been his match.</p><p>He still did not know that the first round was actually Lu Ming’s idea. Otherwise, he would really be so angry that he would vomit blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few elders of the shenyuan Empire appeared in the sky. The array in the area was hidden.</p><p>the test is over. Combining the results of the three rounds, Ouyang Wushuang is the champion. He will be promoted to the Crown Prince in three days!</p><p>An elder announced.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji clenched their fists tightly and were filled with hatred. From now on, they were going to be trampled under Ouyang Wushuang”s feet.</p><p>Then, everyone returned to their respective mansions. Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion was naturally in a celebratory mood and a banquet was held for three days.</p><p>Three days later, the shenyuan Empire held the crown prince”s promotion ceremony. The purple flame villa and the only divine temple sent people to congratulate them, but the Daluo heaven sect did not.</p><p>After the ceremony, Ouyang Wushuang was officially crowned as the Crown Prince. Lu Ming and the rest had achieved their initial goal.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had another goal now. He had to figure out what exactly had happened to Qiu Yue. How could he help Qiu Yue recover?</p><p>Therefore, on the seventh day after Ouyang Wushuang became the Crown Prince, Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang went to the only sacred Hall together.</p><p>The only holy temple was an ancient palace. It was suspended in the sky and was surrounded by clouds. It was like a Fairyland.</p><p>There was a flight of stairs that extended down from the only holy temple, and there were at least tens of thousands of steps.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang landed on the steps and stepped up. Soon, they had reached tens of thousands of steps. However, they were blocked by two people at the top of the steps.</p><p>“Who are you? This is the only sacred Hall, and you are not allowed to barge in!”</p><p>The two of them were the guards. One of them opened his mouth, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“I’m Ouyang Wushuang, and 1 have something to ask of senior ice screen!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang cupped his fists.</p><p>Bing mu was Qiu Yue’s master. He was the one who had brought Qiu Yue from the divine wilderness.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang? So it’s Crown Prince shenyuan. I’ve been disrespectful!”</p><p>The two guards ’expressions changed.</p><p>If it was an ordinary Prince of the shenyuan Empire, they could ignore him. However, the Crown Prince was different. He would rule the shenyuan Empire in the future and become a hegemon. His status was completely different from that of an ordinary Prince.</p><p>“Please wait a moment, Crown Prince. I’ll pass the message now! ”</p><p>One of the guards said.</p><p>“Wait, we can’t let them in!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Then, a few figures walked out from the depths of the palace.</p><p>“Yu Shu…”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The person in the lead was Yu Shu. The others were all extraordinary geniuses.</p><p>The two guards saluted Yu Shu and the others. It was obvious that Yu Shu s status in the only holy temple was not low.</p><p>“Oh, so it’s Prince Wushuang. What are you doing here at our sole divine temple?”</p><p>Yu Shu asked with a faint smile on her face.</p><p>“Lu Ming and I are here to pay a visit to senior ice screen! “’</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang tried to be patient and repeated it.</p><p>“Meet the ice curtain sect’s Grand Supreme elder? I advise you to go back. Do you think the ice curtain sect’s Grand Supreme elder is someone you can meet whenever you want?”</p><p>Yu Shu said indifferently.</p><p>“You can go and pass on the message. Senior ice screen will decide whether to see or not!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Pass on the message? Who Do You Think You Are? I’m telling you, the Grand Supreme elder of the ice curtain is in seclusion and won’t see anyone. You can leave!”</p><p>Yu Shu’s face darkened as she chided.</p><p>‘If senior ice screen is not free today, then 1 will come again tomorrow. If you are not free tomorrow, then I will come again the day after. One day, senior ice screen will be free.”</p><p>Lu Ming said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
