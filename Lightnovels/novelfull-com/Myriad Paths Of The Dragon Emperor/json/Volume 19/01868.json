After they destroyed the HA family, they went back to the wild Sacred Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming brought desolate power and the rest to the Dayan elixir Palace.</p><p>After returning to the great Yan elixir Palace, Lu Ming immediately went to the Phoenix Palace. As expected, he found out that the heavenly Emperor city’s yuan mountain Saint Academy had held a meeting two and a half months ago. Almost all the famous geniuses of the ancient Moon Holy Land had rushed to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others naturally headed to heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Without the competition of the younger generation, ancient Moon Holy Land became quiet.</p><p>However, one could imagine how lively and intense the heavenly Emperor City would be.</p><p>Lu Ming had also planned to head to the heavenly Emperor city’s yuan mountain sacred Academy. When desolate li and the rest knew that the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy had gathered, they all revealed a strong desire to fight and were extremely excited.</p><p>The main purpose of them following Lu Ming out was to gain experience and clash with the other prodigies so that they could improve themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, the desolate race loved to fight. With so many elites gathered, they were naturally excited.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not waste any time. On the third day of their return to the Dayan elixir Palace, they headed to the Phoenix Palace and took the teleportation array to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>As for Ouyang Moli, Lu Ming had asked him to stay in the Dayan elixir Hall and cultivate with uncle Kong.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s cultivation had also broken through to the bright Saint realm after this period of cultivation. Lu Ming brought Xue ningxin with him to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor City was located in the central area of Mount Yuan. It was the head of the nine Holy Lands of Mount Yuan. Legend had it that it was built by an unrivaled heavenly Emperor expert, and the cultivation conditions were unique.</p><p>However, it was said that the heavenly Emperor expert had fallen a long time ago. After that, many heroes fought for power in heavenly Emperor City. Now, it was occupied by many powerful forces, and they had developed into extremely powerful forces.</p><p>In the eight directions of the heavenly Emperor City, there were eight satellite cities. If the forces from other regions of the yuan mountain wanted to reach the heavenly Emperor City, they could only teleport to one of the eight satellite cities.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were teleported to a satellite city in the southernmost area and then flew to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>From a distance, one could see a vast city in front of them, full of a magnificent aura. When they approached heavenly Emperor City, they felt a terrifying pressure spreading out, as if a Supreme existence lived in heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>When they walked into heavenly Emperor City, what greeted their eyes were ancient buildings that had been preserved for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>They asked around for the location of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>Now, everyone in the heavenly Emperor City knew about the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Created by a few emperors, the entire Yuan mountain was filled with geniuses and attracted the attention of countless people.</p><p>They easily found out the location of the yuan mountain sacred Academy and headed there.</p><p>Heaven Emperor City was incomparably vast and boundless. It was just a city, but its surface area was much larger than ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>They spent a lot of time before finally finding the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>On the tall and majestic gate, there were four words: Yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>“Stop! What are you doing here?”</p><p>A middle-aged man blocked Lu Ming and the rest’s path.</p><p>“Senior, we are here to join the yuan mountain sacred Academy.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and explained his purpose of visit to the middle-aged man.</p><p>“You only came to join the yuan mountain sacred Academy now? The yuan mountain sacred Academy has already been holding this meeting for two months. Don’t you know?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face darkened.</p><p>“Senior, we were delayed because we had an important matter to attend to. As soon as we finished, we rushed over. Please make an exception for us!”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>it’s not impossible to make an exception. The great emperor has given the order that those who come late can also enter the sacred Academy. However, the requirements are higher. Show me your cultivation base and let me see!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. Following that, their auras spread out from their bodies.</p><p>“Great sage realm? what? So many great saints?”</p><p>The middle-aged man sensed it and his expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of more than a dozen people were almost all in the eminent Saint stage, and they were all at the peak of the eminent Saint stage or above. Only Xue ningxin was in the bright Saint stage.</p><p>Especially desolate li and the others. All of them were burly, and even the shortest one was more than two meters tall. Which faction did they come from?</p><p>After taking a deep breath, the middle-aged man finally calmed down and said, ” I’m a teacher of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Let me tell you, the minimum condition to join the yuan mountain sacred Academy is to reach the bright Saint realm. Your spiritual body must also be a heavenly spiritual body. So, I have to check your spiritual bodies. Follow me!</p><p>After saying that, the middle-aged man walked into the inner area of the yuan mountain sacred Institute, followed by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After walking into the yuan mountain sacred Academy, one could see that there were many majestic divine mountains in the depths of the sacred Academy, towering into the clouds.</p><p>On the divine mountain, there were all sorts of buildings and palaces.</p><p>There were also various buildings built on the flat land.</p><p>Although every inch of land in the heavenly Emperor City was extremely valuable and ordinary powerhouses could not live in it, the yuan mountain sacred Academy was jointly established by a few great emperors and naturally occupied a vast territory. No one dared to say a word.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a large hall. In the center of the hall, there was a stone tablet that looked like a crystal.</p><p>this crystal stele was made by the great emperor. It can detect the level of a spirit body. All of you, walk into the crystal stele. I’ll have a way to find out your spirit body level!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>This was desolate Li’s first time leaving the wild sacred domain, so he was very curious about everything. He was the first to step forward, walking to the crystal stele.</p><p>The crystal stele immediately began to glow, enveloping the desolate power.</p><p>Then, the crystal stele emitted a strange light.</p><p>“A superior-grade heavenly spiritual body!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was a little surprised. Then, a book appeared in his hand and he said, what’s your name? I need to register your information!</p><p>“Desolate power!”</p><p>Desolate li reported his name and age.</p><p>“Alright, you can enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Next!”</p><p>After the middle-aged man filled in the information, he looked at the others.</p><p>Desolate force retreated, and desolate land advanced.</p><p>it’s a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body again!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes widened.</p><p>Even though he had seen countless heaven’s favorites during this period of time, there were only a few who had a superior-grade heaven spiritual body. He didn’t expect to see two of them today.</p><p>After he registered the desolate land’s information, another youth from the desolate race came forward.</p><p>and it’s a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>The middle-aged man gasped.</p><p>It was incredible for upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies to appear consecutively, and all at once.</p><p>However, his surprise didn’t end there. After that, his surprise turned into shock.</p><p>Out of the nine desolate race elites, there were five high-tier heavenly spiritual bodies and four middle-tier heavenly spiritual bodies.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and Qiu Yue, they both had upper-grade heavenly spiritual bodies. When bubbles went up for the test, it showed that she also had upper-grade heavenly spiritual bodies.</p><p>This made the middle-aged man dumbfounded, and his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Who were these people? there were so many upper-class heaven spiritual bodies. Was there a King body among them?</p><p>When these people grew up, they would be incredible..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
