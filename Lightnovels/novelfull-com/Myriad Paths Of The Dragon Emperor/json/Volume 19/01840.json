Since the imprints were already obtained by the other party, even if they killed the other party, they would not be able to take them back. Hence, there was no need to fight Ouyang Wuji head-on.</p><p>...</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang and Lu Ming …”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s expression was extremely cold. The little girl was following Lu Ming and blocked them with the space law. Otherwise, Ouyang Wushuang might not have been able to obtain the mark.</p><p>I just saw that Ouyang Wushuang already has three marks. Lu Ming also has one!</p><p>Yu Shu walked to Ouyang Wuji’s side and said.</p><p>This made Ouyang Wuji’s expression even uglier.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and the others had already obtained four marks. Twelve marks took up one-third of the total, while they only had two marks.</p><p>If they had obtained the previous one, they might have been able to fight for it. But now, it was difficult.</p><p>If he lost again in this round, he would have no fate with the position of Crown Prince.</p><p>“I wonder how many imprints Ouyang wudao has obtained?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>let’s continue our search. Let’s go!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji suppressed his anger and led the group in another direction.</p><p>Not long after, they really did run into a person with a mark. His cultivation was at the lower tier of the absolute Saint realm, but he was quickly severely injured by their combined forces.</p><p>“Don’t kill him yet, just cripple his cultivation!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said before crippling his cultivation.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>let’s keep it first. We’ll make a decision later based on the situation!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s eyes flashed coldly as he kept the man into his Grotto-heaven treasure.</p><p>Although Grotto-heaven treasures were precious, geniuses like them who came from powerful forces naturally had no lack of them.</p><p>After keeping it, they continued their search.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, they were also looking for it. However, after obtaining the fourth mark, they did not encounter anyone with a mark after going around in a big circle.</p><p>There were a total of 12 of them, and as time passed, they would surely become fewer and fewer. It would also become more and more difficult to encounter them.</p><p>“Don’t tell me there’s no more!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>no, if all twelve marks were obtained, the clan elder would definitely remind us and not let us continue searching like this!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>Then, everyone continued their search.</p><p>At this moment, the blood soul sect was in complete chaos. Many experts had been killed, and those with weaker cultivation were running or hiding.</p><p>This made Lu Ming sigh.</p><p>The blood soul sect’s strength, if placed in the Azure continent, was stronger than any of the thirteen top forces in the Azure continent.</p><p>The blood soul sect had at least a dozen absolute Saints. Such a powerful force had been destroyed because of a test from the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>This was how the world of martial Dao worked. The strong lived, and the weak died. The strong could decide the life and death of the weak with a single word.</p><p>Therefore, countless people cultivated with all their might and went to dangerous places to take risks. They did everything they could to increase their strength.</p><p>Only with great power could one control their own fate, and even the fate of others.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent boom came from the front, and terrifying beams of light shot into the sky.</p><p>Someone was fighting.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang sent a message to everyone. Then, everyone concealed their aura and moved forward.</p><p>They climbed up a huge mountain and hid behind a huge rock as they looked forward.</p><p>In front of them, a group of people were attacking a middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s cultivation was terrifying. He had reached the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>This was the first time they’d encountered a late-stage absolute Saint in the blood soul sect.</p><p>The ones attacking him were the first Prince, Ouyang wudao, and the heaven’s favorites who helped him.</p><p>A total of more than ten heaven’s favorites surrounded the middle-aged man. Among them, Ouyang wudao and a white-robed young man were the strongest. The two of them were the main attackers while the others supported them.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and the white-robed youth are both upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and the white-robed young man, Bai mu, were both upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies. Their cultivation had reached the great saint perfection. Although the laws they controlled were not the king path laws, they were still extremely powerful laws. Their combat strength was shocking. The two of them joined forces and fought against the middle-aged man.</p><p>With the help of the other heaven’s favorites, the middle-aged man was no match for him. He was suppressed and his death was only a matter of time. “There’s a mark on that person’s body!”</p><p>The eyes of Lu Ming and the group lit up.</p><p>“What should we do? Ouyang wudao and the people he brought with him are too powerful!”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>Just Ouyang wudao and Bai mu alone had astonishing combat strength. Apart from Ouyang Wushuang, there was probably no one who could defeat them. Although Lu Ming was strong, in the eyes of the others, he might not be a match for either Ouyang wudao or Bai mu.</p><p>The other geniuses of the Daluo heaven sect were almost all medium grade heavenly spiritual bodies, and their cultivation had reached the great saint perfection. This force was too strong. They were no match for it if they tried to snatch it by force.</p><p>However, he was unwilling to give up just like that.</p><p>They currently had four marks. If they could obtain one more, or five marks, they would have a much higher chance of winning.</p><p>If they won first place again in this round, there would be no need to compete in the third round. Ouyang Wushuang would directly become the Crown Prince. Therefore, this mark was very important.</p><p>“Who are you people? Why are you attacking my blood soul sect?”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared. He was already injured, and his death was only a matter of time.</p><p>He was shocked and furious. He didn’t understand where these people came from.</p><p>These people were all young, but their cultivation was amazing. Almost all of them were at the peak of the great saint realm or the great saint perfection realm. Their combat strength was also amazing. Almost all of them could fight above their level.</p><p>Where did they come from? when did they offend such a group of people?</p><p>“You don’t have the right to know who we are. Kill!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao was incomparably tyrannical, and his combat strength was extremely terrifying. His violent attacks were like a violent storm as he attacked his opponent.</p><p>The attacks of the others also poured toward the middle-aged man. Although the middle-aged man tried his best to block, some of the attacks still landed on his body. His body almost exploded and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. “Not good, the other party is about to be killed!”</p><p>The faces of the paragons from the purple flame villa changed.</p><p>“You guys stay here and don’t move. Leave this person to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Ouyang Wushuang and the others. Then, he sank into the ground and completely concealed his aura. He headed toward the battlefield silently. In a short while, Lu Ming appeared below the battlefield.</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man’s injuries were even more serious and he could be killed at any moment.</p><p>“Bubble, do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bubbles circulated the space-time law and Lu Ming’s body distorted like waves of water. He disappeared like an illusion. In the next moment, Lu Ming’s figure appeared directly beside the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao shouted when he noticed Lu Ming’s sudden appearance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a holy weapon flew towards the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man was shocked and was about to block it when he heard Lu Ming mumble ‘explode’..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
