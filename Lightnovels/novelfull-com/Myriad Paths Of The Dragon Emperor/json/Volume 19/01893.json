We can’t let these people live. If we let them live, they might bring trouble to us!</p><p>The burly man also said coldly.</p><p>“I also think we can’t keep them!”</p><p>“Then kill them!”</p><p>The others spoke up one after another. Of course, they were all using voice transmission, so those who chose to stay could not hear them at all.</p><p>“Good! Then let’s kill them first, then go down and surround them. Don’t let them escape!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder spoke!</p><p>In an instant, everyone’s figures flashed and surrounded those who chose to stay.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue did not move.</p><p>Although the world of martial arts was cruel and the strong preyed on the weak, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had their own principles. These people had no enmity with them and they would not kill them for this reason.</p><p>Of course, they would not stop him.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>The expressions of those who stayed behind changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The purple-robed old man shouted coldly. They made their move. A dazzling and deadly light burst out, killing those who stayed behind.</p><p>Those who chose to stay were already in the minority. How could they resist? they were instantly killed one by one.</p><p>“You guys … He’s too vicious!”</p><p>Someone howled, extremely unwilling.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>The brawny man sneered and killed the man with a slash.</p><p>In just a few minutes, those who stayed behind were all killed.</p><p>With a single thought, those people would face death!</p><p>alright, there’s nothing to worry about now. Let’s go down!</p><p>The purple-robed elder said.</p><p>After that, everyone got into formation and carefully flew toward the abyss.</p><p>Looking down from above the abyss, it was pitch black and nothing could be seen.</p><p>“Surrender!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder’s cultivation was unfathomable. He was an</p><p>Emperor-to-be expert, so everyone naturally took him as their leader. As soon as he finished speaking, everyone flew down the abyss.</p><p>The abyss was very deep, and they only reached the bottom after descending for tens of thousands of feet.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>As soon as he landed, Lu Ming looked in one direction in shock.</p><p>In that direction, there was a huge sword stuck in the ground. It was at least a hundred meters tall and extremely huge.</p><p>Under the huge sword, a figure sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. No aura could be sensed from his body.</p><p>“Luo Xiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Luo Xiang was indeed under the abyss.</p><p>However, Luo Xiang didn’t fight his way out of the abyss like his master, the sect leader of the life and death Sword sect. Instead, he sat under the giant sword, and no one could sense his aura.</p><p>Could it be that he had already fallen?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but feel that it was a pity!</p><p>Although he didn’t have much contact with Luo Xiang, he could feel that this person was an open and aboveboard person. He was born for the sword and was a true swordsman.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to another direction.</p><p>There, endless sword sources gathered and circled.</p><p>Under the endless sword source, a figure was staring at Lu Ming and the others with sharp eyes.</p><p>“This is a swordfiend!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. The figure under the endless sword source was clearly a swordfiend. However, this swordfiend was completely different from the swordfiends that Lu Ming had seen before. This swordfiend was not only more solid in form, but its eyes also shone with wisdom.</p><p>This swordfiend had intelligence!</p><p>The others also noticed the swordfiend and their expressions turned grave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the Grand astral treasure Lotus!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nudged Lu Ming and said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Qiu Yue’s gaze and realized that the Grand Lunar treasure Lotus was rooted on a pile of bones. The Lotus petals swayed gently, rippling with sword Qi.</p><p>hehehe, you’re all here. Just in time, let’s sacrifice you to my sword!</p><p>The sword fiend let out an ear-piercing laugh.</p><p>“How is that possible? Didn’t the sword fiend not have any intelligence? This swordfiend, how did it gain sentience?”</p><p>“Could it be that the people who walked out of the abyss before were all controlled by him? The gathering of the sword source is also because of him?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed and they were shocked.</p><p>Some people had been in the Taiyi sword tomb for many years, but they had never heard that the sword fiend could give birth to a spirit. They had never seen the source of the sword gather here.</p><p>“Today, 1 will use your blood as a sacrifice to the sword. Condense!”</p><p>Jiansha shouted and raised his palm. The endless sword source gathered towards jiansha’s arm and formed a huge combat sword.</p><p>At the same time, from above the abyss, wisps of blood Qi gathered and gathered on the sword fiend, making his body more solid.</p><p>The blood Qi was the blood of those who had died in battle above the abyss.</p><p>Could it be that the reason why those people had come out and fought with them was because they needed blood?</p><p>Many people’s expressions turned ugly when they thought of this.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out from jiansha’s body.</p><p>This aura was extremely powerful and superior. It was even more powerful and pure than the aura of the purpie-robed elder, an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>That was Emperor pressure!</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>A pure Emperor pressure, this was an Emperor-ranked powerhouse!</p><p>There was actually a monarch level expert hiding under the abyss. Many people’s hearts trembled, and they felt a chill all over their bodies.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Someone roared and rose into the air, rushing toward the top of the abyss, trying to escape.</p><p>Against an Emperor-level expert, no matter how many people they had, it was useless. Only death awaited them.</p><p>hehe, 1 told you, I’ll use your blood as a sacrifice to my sword to help me reach the final step. All of you, stay!</p><p>Jian Sha laughed coldly. He raised the giant sword that was formed by endless sword source high up in the air. Instantly, endless sword light condensed in the sky. These sword lights were like battle swords, with the tip pointing down and showing off its sharpness, blocking all directions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sword fiend let out another cold cry, and endless sword light, covering the sky and earth, stabbed down towards everyone.</p><p>Instantly, a series of screams rang out. One figure after another was either pierced by the sword light or cut in half. Their souls were annihilated and they died here.</p><p>After these people died, their blood gathered towards the sword fiend, making his aura even stronger.</p><p>“The Yin Yang wheel!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted as a wheel appeared on her forehead.</p><p>This wheel emitted a cold Qi on one side and a hot Qi on the other. The two combined and triggered a terrifying pressure.</p><p>It was the emperor’s might, and it was obvious that this was a monarch weapon.</p><p>The Yin Yang wheel hovered above Qiu Yue’s head and cast a light screen that enveloped Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The sword radiances struck the light screen cast by the Yin Yang wheel. The light screen shook violently and rippled, but it still managed to block the attack of the sword radiances.</p><p>There was a flash of light between Lu Ming’s brows. He had wanted to use the Tai Chi formation disk to block it, but after seeing that Qiu Yue could block it, he did not use it.</p><p>Leaving some trump cards to catch people off guard might be of great use at a critical moment.</p><p>After a wave of sword light, there were only twenty people left..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
