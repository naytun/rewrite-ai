There, a figure was flashing over at top speed. Wherever the figure passed, the space rippled like water. It was as if the figure was traveling through space, bubble, where did you go to steal the sacred medicine again? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at the little girl who appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, bad news! Sister Huang Ling is in danger!”</p><p>Said Pao Pao, her large eyes revealing a trace of anxiety.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Instantly, Pao Pao started chattering away.</p><p>It turned out that bubbles had sneaked into the WAN family’s sacred medicine plantation to eat the sacred medicine and had accidentally heard a secret.</p><p>The number one genius of the WAN family, Wan Zhengyang, had found out about Huang Ling’s current cultivation place. He was going to join forces with a group of strong cultivators to kill her in secret.</p><p>“The WAN family again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He knew that the WAN family was taking revenge.</p><p>Huang Ling and Lu Ming were very close. Some people even said that Huang Ling was Lu Ming’s woman. Therefore, they wanted to kill Huang Ling to take revenge on Lu Ming.</p><p>Bubbles, do you know where Phoenix spirit is cultivating?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I heard from the WAN family that it’s in the ten thousand flame mountain!”</p><p>Pao Pao said.</p><p>“Where is the ten thousand flame mountain? Let’s not waste any time, we’ll go and find out immediately. Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, turned into a stream of light, and flew away.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and bubbles came to a gathering place. After inquiring about the location of the thousand flame mountain, they hurried there.</p><p>Myriad flame mountain was a mountain range filled with flames. It was the favorite place of those who cultivated fire-attributed laws. It was more effective to comprehend the laws of fire here than anywhere else.</p><p>Huang Ling cultivated the law of the unperishable flame, and she often came to the myriad flame mountain to cultivate.</p><p>In a Valley on the myriad flame mountain, flames were burning fiercely. Bi Lin sat cross-legged in the valley. Around her, an undying celestial Phoenix was dancing. The surrounding flames were constantly gathering.</p><p>Suddenly, Huang Ling opened her eyes and looked at the entrance of the valley. She shouted,” “Who is it?”</p><p>as expected of the undying Heavenly Phoenix body. Your spiritual sense is quite sharp!</p><p>A cold sneer was heard. Then, five figures appeared at the entrance of the valley.</p><p>“Wan Zhengyang!” He shouted.</p><p>Huang Ling’s face darkened.</p><p>The person in the lead was the number one prodigy of the WAN clan, Wan Zhengyang.</p><p>Behind him, the other four people were all experts. They were all great saints at the peak or great saint perfection.</p><p>These people were almost 50 years old and were at the edge of the younger generation.</p><p>“This is my cultivation ground. What are you doing here?”</p><p>Huang Ling said in a deep voice.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s eyes flickered with cold killing intent. “I’m here to kill you, of course. Lu Ming, that b * stard, caused the WAN family to lose a true Emperor. This enmity is irreconcilable. However, he’s hiding in the Dayan elixir Palace and doesn’t dare to come out. I’ll kill you first. As Lu Ming’s woman, I’m afraid his heart will ache if you die. Hahaha!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s face turned red. It seemed that the outside world had misunderstood and thought that she was Lu Ming’s woman. However, she did not refute him. A powerful aura emanated from her body as she said,”It’s not that easy to kill me with just you guys!”</p><p>so you’ve broken through to the great sage realm. But you still have to die!</p><p>Wan Zhengyang sneered, and a terrifying aura burst out of his body.</p><p>“Great sage Great Perfection!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression changed.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s cultivation was at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm. He did not expect that he had already broken through to the perfected Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>If Wan Zhengyang’s cultivation was still at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm, Huang Ling could still fight him with the help of the law of unperishable flame. However, Wan Zhengyang had broken through to the Great Perfection of the Supreme Saint realm, and with the other Four Masters, Huang Ling was not confident.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Phoenix shadow around her fanned and her figure soared into the sky.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>A Wolf’s howl resounded in the sky as a huge Wolf Claw clawed at Huang Ling.</p><p>“Phoenix Wing strike!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression changed. She raised her palm and a Phoenix Wing formed. Like a Divine Blade, it slashed at the Wolf’s claw.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Huang Ling’s body trembled as she was knocked down by a powerful force and returned to the valley.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>In the sky, several wolf howls sounded, and a few giant wolves appeared.</p><p>“Skywolf tower!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression darkened.</p><p>A few giant wolves glanced at Feng Ling with cold eyes.</p><p>you’ve joined forces to kill me. If the Phoenix Palace finds out, we won’t let you off easily. Are you going to start a war between the major forces?”</p><p>Huang Ling shouted.</p><p>“So what if you know? We’ve only sent out the younger generation, not the older generation!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang sneered.</p><p>The people who followed them were all around 50 years old and could be considered to be from the younger generation. Indeed, they did not send anyone from the older generation.</p><p>As for the younger generation’s competition, whether it was a one-on-one fight or being surrounded, there were no restrictions.</p><p>“Moreover, as long as you die, no one will know that we did it. Kill!”</p><p>die! Wan Zhengyang shouted. All the acupoints in his body glowed, and Saint weapons flew out. He held an absolute Saint weapon and charged at Huang Ling.</p><p>“Nine Phoenix strikes!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s arms trembled like Phoenix wings. She made nine moves in a row, and phoenixes appeared one after another. They tore through the void and charged toward Wan Zhengyang.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang wielded his absolute Saint weapon and continued to attack, clashing with the Phoenix Spirit.</p><p>After nine consecutive booms, Huang Ling’s body trembled and she retreated.</p><p>After all, Wan Zhengyang was the number one genius of the WAN family. His cultivation had reached the Great Perfection of the Supreme Saint realm, and his spiritual body was a medium-grade heaven spiritual body. His combat power was very shocking.</p><p>Although Huang Ling had mastered the laws of the king path, she was still no match for him when her cultivation was so far behind.</p><p>the laws of the king path are indeed powerful. However, you still have to die. Kill!</p><p>die! Wan Zhengyang shouted and charged at Huang Ling again.</p><p>“The undying cage!”</p><p>fire cage! Huang Ling shouted, and the flames in the area gathered towards her, forming a cage of flames that trapped Wan Zhengyang.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Wan Zhengyang kept attacking the fire cage, but he couldn’t break it.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Ling charged towards the entrance of the valley.</p><p>“Let’s attack together, don’t let her escape!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang roared.</p><p>The experts from the WAN family who came with Wan Zhengyang attacked together. Terrifying attacks were launched at Huang Ling. At the same time, a few giant wolves in the sky roared and pounced at Huang Ling.</p><p>“Nine Phoenix strikes!”</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit let out a long cry, and her arms trembled. She continuously struck out with terrifying offensive power, and nine phoenixes pounced out.</p><p>One of the four experts from the WAN family was at the peak of the great saint realm. He was killed by the two phoenixes and turned into ashes in the flames.</p><p>The other people’s figures also trembled and retreated.</p><p>Huang Ling seized the opportunity and rushed towards the entrance of the valley..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
