They did not believe that Lu Ming and the rest, who were so young, could compete with an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>young master, don’t be careless. That ha Zheng is …</p><p>The old man was worried and wanted to persuade Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and then looked at the HA family member. He chided,” “Still not leaving? do you want to die?”</p><p>The man from ha clan was so scared that his face turned pale. He ran for his life and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The old man and the Huang family’s young lady’s faces went pale and they were anxious.</p><p>“Senior, if you have something to do, you can leave first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Then … Then take care, young master!”</p><p>In the end, the old man did not dare to stay there. He cupped his fists at Lu Ming and left with the Huang family’s young lady, heading out of the barren city.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them waited quietly here.</p><p>who are they? they killed the HA family’s people and still dare to wait here? ”</p><p>how dare he! He’s like a newborn calf that’s not afraid of the Tiger. He’s trying to be a hero, but he doesn’t know how terrifying the HA family is!</p><p>“I’ll regret it when the experts of the HA family arrive!”</p><p>Many people had seen what had just happened here, and they were now watching from a distance and discussing in low voices.</p><p>At this moment, in a courtyard of the HA family, two beautiful women were waiting on hammer.</p><p>Hammerty felt so good, so good that he could die.</p><p>These two young women were the daughters of other major forces. In the past, he could only look at them, but it was not so easy to get them.</p><p>But now, all of them were serving him with all their hearts and allowing him to play with them.</p><p>Hammerte was extremely excited.</p><p>He suddenly thought of Lu Ming. He felt that he should thank Lu Ming.</p><p>If it weren’t for Lu Ming, the powerhouses from the other forces wouldn’t have entered the wild Sanctuary and never returned. The barren city would have become the HA family’s territory.</p><p>When did he ever have such a good life?</p><p>He had decided to play with all the beautiful women in the barren city.</p><p>Just as he was fantasizing, a loud shout came from outside the courtyard,” “Young master, young master, bad news!”</p><p>Hamilton’s face darkened.</p><p>He had already instructed that no one was to disturb him when he was doing his work. Now that the shouts outside had completely ruined his mood, he was very unhappy.</p><p>After putting on his clothes, Hamilton walked out of the courtyard with a gloomy face. The middle-aged man that Lu Ming had let go of earlier was standing anxiously outside the courtyard.</p><p>“What is it? Why are you in such a panic?”</p><p>Hamilton asked with a dark face.</p><p>young master, you asked us to capture the Huang family’s young lady, but someone meddled in our business halfway and saved her. They even killed the others. Young master, you must avenge them!</p><p>“Who is so bold to kill my ha family’s people?”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed through hammerte’s eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the HA family had dominated barren city, and no one dared to disobey them. However, someone had the guts to kill a member of the HA family, which was really shocking.</p><p>“It’s a young man and a young woman with a little girl…”</p><p>The middle-aged man described the appearance of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“What? It was them? How is that possible?”</p><p>Hamilton’s pupils shrank as he cried out in disbelief.</p><p>The moment he heard it, he knew that it was Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and bubbles.</p><p>However, didn’t lu Ming and the rest enter the savage barren ancient realm with them? Why did he come out?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming and the rest had escaped from the savage barren ancient realm after he and Ha Zheng had escaped?</p><p>Hammerty thought that it was very possible.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming’s group was not too far from the exit of the ancient Savage barren realm. It was very likely that after they escaped, Lu Ming’s group followed them.</p><p>you’re quite lucky. But since you’ve escaped, you should find a place to hide. You actually dare to meddle in my ha family’s Affairs. You’re really courting death!</p><p>The killing intent in Hamilton’s eyes grew stronger.</p><p>Back then, he was taught a miserable lesson by Lu Ming. Later on, Lu Ming even used him to threaten his father. He had lost all face. How could he not take revenge for such a great enmity?</p><p>Initially, he thought that Lu Ming and the rest had already died in the wild Sanctuary. He did not expect that Lu Ming and the rest were not dead. They even dared to come out and ruin his plans. Weren’t they seeking their own deaths?</p><p>“Young master, should we report this to the master?”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>no need. Father was injured and has only recovered recently. There’s no need to disturb him for such a small matter. I’ll just go find a few elders!</p><p>After saying that, hammerty stepped out.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were still outside the Huang family mansion.</p><p>In the distance, more and more people were watching.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed. He looked ahead and mumbled,”They’re here!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few streaks of light streaked across the sky and flew over at an astonishing speed. The next moment, the streaks of light receded and five or six figures appeared.</p><p>The one in the lead was hammerty. Beside him were a few old men, each of them exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Two in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm and three in the peak of the absolute Saint realm! What a terrifying formation! 1 can’t believe that Hamilton has deployed such a powerful formation. Who are those young men and women?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in the distance.</p><p>Absolute Saints in the great circle and the peak of the absolute Saint realm were definitely the top existences in barren city. They were the overlords of a region. However, so many of them had been mobilized all of a sudden just for a young man and a woman.</p><p>haha, there’s a way to heaven, but you refuse to take it. There’s no Door to Hell, but you’re here. Kid, I’ll make you miserable today!</p><p>When Hamilton saw Lu Ming, he burst into laughter. His eyes glowed with a cold light, especially when he looked at Qiu Yue. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Of course, he did not dare to be careless. He followed closely beside an absolute Saint in the perfection stage. He would never forget how Lu Ming and the others had taken ha Zheng down in a strange manner in front of him.</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? Do you know why I’m still here?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Oh? Could it be that he was waiting for me?” Hammerte said.</p><p>at least you have some brains. Not bad, I’ll wait for you to kill you! Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, kill me? Kid, you do have some combat power, but 1 came prepared this time. Let’s see how you’re going to kill me!”</p><p>“Attack and cripple them!”</p><p>With the last sentence, Hamilton gave an order to the elders.</p><p>“Kill! Kill!”</p><p>A few elders exploded with cold killing intent.</p><p>A total of four elders stepped out. One of them was in the perfected absolute Saint realm, and the other three were in the peak of the absolute Saint realm. This lineup was more than enough to kill Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The terrifying auras of the four powerhouses crushed toward Lu Ming and the others, sealing off the surroundings for fear that Lu Ming and the others would escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest did not seem to be flustered at all. Their expressions were very calm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
