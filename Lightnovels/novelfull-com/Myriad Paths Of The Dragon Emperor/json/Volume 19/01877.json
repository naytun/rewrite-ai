Dragon star’s Saint power was boiling. He punched out, and a huge Archean dragonesque elephant appeared. It roared at the sky and rushed forward.</p><p>“Extreme star fist!”</p><p>Desolate li punched out as well. A star appeared on his fist, as if he was pushing the star towards the tornado.</p><p>The two’s fist force was filled with boundless power. They used their power to break through all techniques and the heavens.</p><p>The giant elephant and the star collided with the two tornadoes, causing a deafening boom. In the end, the two tornadoes were blocked and dissipated in the sky.</p><p>Feng wuchen’s face turned gloomy after two of his moves were blocked.</p><p>He was in the absolute Saint realm. It would be embarrassing if he could not take down two great saints so easily.</p><p>“Storm Blade of Destruction!”</p><p>die! Feng wuchen shouted. Countless blades appeared around him. They were extremely sharp and had destructive power.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…</p><p>Destructive storm blades shot towards Long Chen and desolate li.</p><p>Long Chen and desolate tried their best to resist, but their cultivation was too weak. They were in a precarious situation.</p><p>“Then, leave these people to us!”</p><p>The paragons of the wind race had their eyes on Phoenix Palace. The other members of the divine elephant sect stepped toward them.</p><p>Mo lang, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, and the others followed and launched a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Send out the news, gather our men, and then defend with all our strength!”</p><p>One of the Phoenix Palace’s paragons shouted, and everyone sent out the news through voice transmission Jade talismans one after another. Then, they went into a defensive stance.</p><p>Some of them were still cultivating in some places in the sacred Institute.</p><p>They were few in number and could only defend.</p><p>A few youths from the desolate race took a step forward and stood at the front of the crowd. They swung their huge battle axes and maces, sending a few elites flying.</p><p>they’re so strong. How many of them have upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies? these people are burly and different from ordinary people. What are their origins?”</p><p>Mo lang exchanged a blow with a desolate race youth, and his body was sent flying. His body was numb, and there was a sharp pain in his arm, as if his bones had almost been shattered.</p><p>it might be one of the ancient race, the desolate race!</p><p>A genius of the wind race said.</p><p>As an ancient race, they naturally knew of the desolate race.</p><p>“Ancient race!”</p><p>Mo lang and the others took a deep breath.</p><p>The ancient race had been passed down since ancient times. They had terrifying secret techniques and their foundations were unfathomable.</p><p>No ancient race could be underestimated.</p><p>leave these few desolate race members to us. You guys deal with the rest!</p><p>The wind race’s Paragon said. A terrifying wind surrounded his body as he charged towards the desolate race youth.</p><p>Mo lang and the others attacked the others.</p><p>Although killing wasn’t allowed in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, it was fine as long as they weren’t crippled or killed.</p><p>They were going to beat the stubborn people of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect half to death and then throw them out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>The desolate race, Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, Thunder God sect, and other sects had fewer people. They were at a complete disadvantage, with some already injured.</p><p>As for Long Chen and desolate li, they were not in a good state either. They were also at a disadvantage and were forced to retreat.</p><p>If not for the fact that both of them cultivated extreme laws and their spiritual bodies were also known for their strength, which meant that their defenses were also extremely strong, they would have already been defeated.</p><p>But even so, it couldn’t hold on for too long.</p><p>Seeing that they were in a precarious situation, a figure flew over from the distance. Before he even arrived, a cold and hot aura burst out. The two curved blades rotated at an extreme speed, forming a terrible destructive force that pressed toward Feng wuchen.</p><p>Qiu Yue had arrived!</p><p>“The law of yin and yang!”</p><p>Feng wuchen’s eyes narrowed. He waved his hand and a destructive Storm Blade slashed towards Qiu Yue. It collided with Qiu Yue’s two curved blades and sparks flew.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Long Chen and desolate li took this opportunity to attack. They broke through dozens of storm blades, and their fists flew toward Feng wuchen like rainbows.</p><p>“If you want to counterattack, you’re still far from it!”</p><p>Feng wuchen shouted coldly. He opened his mouth and blew out a gust of wind that shattered Long Chen’s and desolate’s fists.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Long Chen, and Huang Li joined forces to fight Feng wuchen.</p><p>the king physique of three great saints in the exceptional realm is really amazing. However, even if the three of them join forces, they might not be able to fight Feng wuchen!</p><p>“That’s right. If there was one more person, I’m afraid we could fight!”</p><p>1 wonder if Huang Ling has broken through to the great saint perfection!</p><p>The crowd in the distance discussed animatedly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>And at that moment, there were figures flying over from the distance. They were people from Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and the desolate race who were cultivating elsewhere. They had received the voice transmission and rushed over.</p><p>“Take two hammer strikes from your grandfather!”</p><p>Huang Di waved his two giant hammers and rushed over from the distance. The two giant hammers were like a whirlwind as they smashed toward the second golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The shocking pressure from the hammer made the second Prince of the Golden Crow turn pale with fright. Summoning the divine Sun Fire, he resisted with all his might.</p><p>&Nbsp; but when the hammer fell, the Golden Crow second Prince screamed as his wings exploded. His body was sent flying, and he was severely injured.</p><p>Although the second Prince of the Golden Crow was also in the great circle of the Supreme Saint realm, his spiritual body was only a medium-grade heaven spiritual body. He was no match for the desolate land and was severely injured in one move.</p><p>With the desolate race, Phoenix Palace, and the other sect elites rushing back, they finally stabilized the situation. However, they were still at a disadvantage.</p><p>After all, the other party had the paragons of the wind race. In addition, there were the paragons of the Skywolf tower, Wan family, golden Crow clan, and so on. There were at least a dozen sects from the ancient Moon Holy Land who had joined the wind race. With so many paragons gathered together, there were simply too many people.</p><p>The desolate race, Phoenix Palace, and other sects could only defend, and could not launch a counterattack.</p><p>And as time passed, more and more people were injured.</p><p>At this moment, the cry of a Phoenix resounded through the sky. A flaming phoenix flew over at top speed and enveloped the sky Wolf tower, the Golden Crow race, and a large number of heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“It’s the unperishable flame!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The flaming phoenix screeched and the law of the undying fire was activated. One by one, the young geniuses were sent flying and spat out large mouthfuls of blood. Some of the weaker ones were directly injured and no longer had the strength to fight.</p><p>it’s Huang Ling. Damn it, she has also broken through to the great saint perfection!</p><p>Mo lang roared.</p><p>In the next moment, an undying flame shot towards mo lang, sending him flying and spitting out blood.</p><p>Huang Ling had broken through to the great saint perfection. She was almost invincible among those of the same level.</p><p>Even though the wind race had a few heaven’s favorites with upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies, they were no match for her. They were suppressed by the Phoenix Spirit and were injured by the Phoenix Spirit, greatly reducing their combat strength.</p><p>With the addition of Huang Ling, they immediately stabilized the situation and gained the upper hand.</p><p>Feng Ling, go and help Long Chen and the others. We can hold them off here!</p><p>Mu Qingxue called out.</p><p>Huang Ling had injured a few of the enemy’s strongest elites, and the enemy’s combat strength was greatly reduced. As for them, they had the cooperation of the desolate race’s experts, so they had no problem protecting themselves.</p><p>“Alright, be careful!”</p><p>let’s go! Huang Ling said. The Phoenix formed by the unperishable flame let out a cry and rushed toward Feng wuchen..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
