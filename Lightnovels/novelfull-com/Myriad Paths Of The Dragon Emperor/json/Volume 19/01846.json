It was because of this that the entire region was stirred up. All the geniuses of the yuan Mountain region were gathering towards the heavenly Emperor City, wanting to join the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>One could see how terrifying a great emperor was.</p><p>And Luo cangqiong’s grandfather was actually a great sovereign.</p><p>No wonder lawless dared to take away Qiu Yue’s memory.</p><p>Lu Ming also remembered that Ouyang Wushuang had told him that Qiu Yue’s master had attacked the Daluo heaven sect for some unknown reason, but had retreated silently in the end. It was obviously because of Qiu Yue.</p><p>“I also want to avenge Qiu Yue, but if 1 do, the entire sacred Hall will be buried with her!”</p><p>Bing mu continued, his voice filled with helplessness.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes, revealing a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Ice curtain didn’t dare to kill him, but he did!</p><p>Qiuyue, that girl, is very attached to you. Before she lost her memory, she could not forget you. She hopes that you will come and find her, or that her cultivation will be successful and she will head to the divine wilderness to meet you!</p><p>I heard that during the shenyuan Empire’s assessment, Qiu Yue was very emotional when she saw you. Perhaps, if she is with you for a long time, she might really recover her memories. How about you spend more time with Qiu Yue?”</p><p>Ice screen said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>no need to thank me. 1 also hope that Qiuyue can recover her memory. Her life will not be perfect if she loses a part of her memory. It will be difficult for her to reach the peak of her martial arts!</p><p>Bing mu sighed.</p><p>The cultivation of martial arts was about having a clear mind. However, if a memory was missing in one’s life, everyone would miss it and have a knot in their heart. How could one’s mind be clear? it would be difficult to reach the peak in the end.</p><p>Therefore, the ice curtain also hoped that Qiu Yue could regain her memory.</p><p>“For this period of time, you will live in the one divine Palace. I will arrange a place for you to stay and spend more time with Qiu Yue. How about it?”</p><p>Ice screen said.</p><p>“Thank you, senior. 1 will do my best to help Qiu Yue regain her memories!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>Then, ice curtain asked someone to bring Lu Ming to a courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Ouyang Wushuang, telling him to return first and stay in the sole sanctuary for a period of time.</p><p>Not long after, a figure stepped into the courtyard.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>Obviously, the ice curtain had also told Qiu Yue to stay in this courtyard so that the two of them could spend more time together, hoping that Qiu Yue would remember the past.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu Yue waved her hand, and a snow-white scimitar appeared, emitting a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>“You really know me? What you told me back then, was it true?”</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly.</p><p>“Of course it’s true, every word is true!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hmph, 1 hope it’s true. If I find out in the future that everything you said was a lie and that you’re only using this reason to get close to me, 1’11 definitely kill you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It seemed that Qiu Yue had thought that he was trying to get close to her on purpose.</p><p>However, with Qiu Yue’s looks and talent, it was normal for some people to find all kinds of reasons to get close to her.</p><p>“Don’t worry. If you find out that I’m lying to you, just kill me. Just like last time, 1 won’t fight back.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cold aura finally dissipated and the ice scimitar disappeared. She glanced at Lu Ming’s shoulder and said apologetically,” “You … Are your injuries okay?”</p><p>“It’s okay, it doesn’t matter if you cut me a few more times!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re so glib-tongued, I don’t think you’re a good person either!”</p><p>Qiu Yue snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. This girl’s personality had changed a lot after she lost her memory.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let me tell you about our past!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, go ahead!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded. The two of them sat down on the stone bench in the courtyard and Lu Ming began to talk about the past in detail.</p><p>Qiu Yue frowned and seemed to be in deep thought.</p><p>Every time he talked about something important, Qiu Yue would have some reaction. Her eyes would flash with a look of contemplation and confusion.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming stayed in the only holy temple and spent time with Qiu Yue. They often talked about the past, from when Qiu Yue was young to after she was taken away.</p><p>They talked about everything.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>This kind of interaction had some effect. Qiu Yue said that some images would flash in her mind, but it was difficult to capture.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already very happy. If this continued, Qiu Yue would remember the past sooner or later.</p><p>In a Palace, Yu Shu was discussing some matters with a few young men with a gloomy face.</p><p>I don’t know what the Grand Supreme elder of the ice curtain is thinking. He actually allowed Lu Ming and Junior Sister Qiuyue to live in the same courtyard and spend time with each other. How despicable!</p><p>Yu Shu slammed the table and said hatefully.</p><p>that kid Lu Ming said many times in the shenyuan Empire that he knows Junior Sister Qiuyue and that he’s her young master or something. Could it be true? ”</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>it’s possible. Junior Sister Qiu Yu’s heart used to belong to someone, so Luo cangqiong took away her memory. It’s probably Lu Ming. That’s why the Grand Supreme elder of the ice screen let Lu Ming and Qiu Yue live together, hoping that Qiu Yue can regain her memory!</p><p>The other young man speculated.</p><p>“No, we can’t let this happen. I think it’s better to let Luo cangqiong know about it!”</p><p>Yu Shu said, her eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>“Senior brother Yu, you’re so smart. If Luo cangqiong knew about this, he would definitely kill Lu Ming. This plan of killing with a borrowed knife is really smart!”</p><p>A young man laughed.</p><p>“Hehehe!” Yu Shu also laughed. Then, they sent someone to pass the news to the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>Time flew by and another five days passed.</p><p>On this day, a group of people arrived at the only holy temple.</p><p>The leader of the group was a young man with a cold expression. He was dressed in a purple robe, and his gaze was sharp like lightning.</p><p>Behind the young man were a few elders, all of whom exuded powerful auras.</p><p>When ordinary people arrived at the one and only Sacred Palace, they would have to land on the ground and climb up the stairs step by step to show respect to the one and only Sacred Palace. However, these people directly flew up, bypassing the stairs and flying towards the one and only Sacred Palace.</p><p>“Everyone, please wait!”</p><p>The two guards blocked the group’s path.</p><p>“Get lost. I want to see Lu Ming!”</p><p>The young man in the lead shouted coldly in an overbearing manner.</p><p>“Everyone, this is the only Sacred Palace. Who are you? If you want to see anyone, 1 can pass the message on your behalf!”</p><p>One of the guards said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
