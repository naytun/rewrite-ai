He was ranked second, and Ouyang Wuji was naturally ranked last.</p><p>After the rankings were announced, it was announced that the second round would be held in three days.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In Ouyang wudao’s mansion, he smacked his palm heavily and a stone table was turned into ashes.</p><p>This time, he had only gotten second place. His original goal was to get first place in all three rounds and win the Crown Prince position with a crushing advantage.</p><p>“Don’t worry, first Prince. The second and third rounds will be based on battle prowess. We’ll definitely help the first Prince obtain two victories in a row, and the position of Crown Prince will be yours!”</p><p>A genius of the Daluo heaven sect said with a confident look.</p><p>In the first round, they were not very good at leading an Army and fighting. They could not display their advantage in combat strength. However, in the next two rounds, they would definitely take first place.</p><p>“I’ll make Ouyang Wushuang pay for the next two rounds!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao’s eyes were cold.</p><p>At the same time, Ouyang Wuji’s angry roar could be heard from his mansion.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang, I will make you pay the price!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji roared.</p><p>In the first round, he had gotten third place. The situation was extremely disadvantageous to him. Unless he got first place in the next two rounds, he would have no hope if he did not get first place even once.</p><p>sixth Prince, don’t worry. The only sacred Hall will definitely help you get first place!</p><p>The sole divine temple’s chosen, Yu Kuang, spoke.</p><p>However, Ouyang Wuji’s face was gloomy and he didn’t say anything. It was not easy to get the first place since the first Prince had the help of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>However, Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion was in a celebratory mood.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang had taken the first place in the first round and occupied an advantageous position. As long as he won the first place in the next two rounds, the position of Crown Prince would belong to Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>As for the people from Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion, they were naturally happy that they could rise to the top.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he entered the mountain and river diagram immediately after he returned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the void of the mountain and river diagram, a figure was dancing. Six vortexes were suspended in the void, erupting with terrible power, as if everything could escape into Samsara.</p><p>After a while, the six vortexes disappeared, and a figure emerged.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli appeared in front of Lu Ming and bowed.</p><p>hmm, your cultivation has reached the peak of the martial King realm. Not bad!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>During this period of time, not only had Ouyang Moli consolidated his cultivation, but he had also advanced to the peak of the martial King realm. This speed was simply shocking, even faster than Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>Of course, this was because Ouyang Moli had obtained the heart of the world from the reincarnation Emperor. That was why his cultivation speed was so terrifying. Towards the end, his speed would slowly slow down, but it would definitely not be slow.</p><p>Of course, this was also due to Ouyang Moli’s own hard work. Previously, he was called trash and was bullied by others for many years. Now that he had awakened his bloodline, he naturally worked hard in cultivation.</p><p>alright, your cultivation has stabilized. Go out for a walk!</p><p>Lu Ming said. With a thought, he brought Ouyang Moli out of the mountain and river diagram. However, he secretly left a mark in Ouyang Moli’s body.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli bowed and left. His eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>He was going to take revenge on those who had humiliated him in the past.</p><p>If there is kindness, there will be kindness. If there is hatred, there will be hatred!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Of course, he knew that Ouyang Moli was going to find trouble with the person who had humiliated him in the past. Hence, he had let Ouyang mo go on purpose.</p><p>Martial artists were particular about having a clear mind. After being bullied, they naturally had to take revenge. Otherwise, if their minds were not clear, it would leave a knot in their hearts, and how could they cultivate in the future?</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in his room, cultivating quietly.</p><p>Ouyang Moli only returned in the evening. He had some minor injuries on his body, but his eyes were extremely bright, as if he had a feeling of exaltation. “You’ve finished your business?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>yes, it’s done. But I only taught them a lesson and didn’t kill them! Ouyang Moli replied.</p><p>they don’t deserve to die. Just teach them a lesson. You should go into the mountain and river diagram and cultivate. After a while, when I’m done here, I’ll take you to a place!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and kept Ouyang Moli back into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was time for the second round of the assessment.</p><p>One day, Ouyang Wushuang brought Lu Ming, the dragon and the phoenix spirits, and the paragons of the purple flame villa to a square.</p><p>Not long after they arrived, a group of people appeared in the air.</p><p>The person in the lead had a burly figure and a domineering gaze. He was the first Prince, Ouyang wudao.</p><p>Beside him, there were more than a dozen heaven’s favorites. Each of them had a strong qi and blood. They were all heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Most of them were the talents of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>ninth brother, you’re early. But I’ll be the first in the next two rounds!</p><p>Ouyang wudao spoke in an overbearing and confident manner.</p><p>“Big brother, let’s see who wins and who loses with our hands!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said indifferently.</p><p>“Hehe, ninth Prince, just these people from the purple flame villa? Where does your confidence come from?”</p><p>A white-robed young man beside the first Prince spoke with a hint of disdain in his voice.</p><p>“Baimu!”</p><p>The purple flame villa’s Xiao Mucheng and the others had ugly expressions, but when they looked at this white-clothed youth, their eyes flashed with fear.</p><p>At this moment, another group of people appeared in the air. It was Ouyang Wuji and the only divine temple, as well as mo lang and the Golden Crow second Prince.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face was gloomy. He glanced at Ouyang Wushuang but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Qiu Yue in the crowd.</p><p>Qiu Yue seemed to have regained her calmness. She glanced at Lu Ming indifferently, her eyes cold.</p><p>“What’s wrong with Qiu Yue? Did you really lose your memory?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not understand.</p><p>He planned to go to the sole divine temple after Ouyang Wushuang’s matter was over. He wanted to find out what had happened to Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this time, a few elders stepped through the air and stood high in the sky.</p><p>“Greetings, clan elder!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao, Ouyang Wuji, and Ouyang Wushuang quickly bowed.</p><p>The others also bowed.</p><p>The elders of the shenyuan Empire were definitely martial Supremes.</p><p>One of the old men waved his hand, and a warship appeared in the sky. It was extremely huge and covered a large shadow.</p><p>get on the warship. The second round of assessment isn’t in the ancient sun sacred land!</p><p>An old man said.</p><p>“Not in the ancient sun sacred land?”</p><p>&Nbsp; many people were moved. The second round of the exam wasn’t held in the ancient sun sacred land. Where was it?</p><p>Without thinking too much, everyone boarded the warship. Then, the warship broke through the sky and left.</p><p>The speed of the warship controlled by a Martial Emperor expert was too shocking. In an instant, it had traveled ten thousand miles. Not long after, it had left the ancient sun sacred land and headed north.</p><p>“Are we going to the land of myriad demons from this direction?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s expression changed slightly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
