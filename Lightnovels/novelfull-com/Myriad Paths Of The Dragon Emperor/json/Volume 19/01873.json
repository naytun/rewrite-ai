Despicable! It was a fair battle and he actually used a monarch weapon!</p><p>...</p><p>Huang Ling shouted.</p><p>what despicable? this is a life-and-death battle. There’s no rule against using monarch weapons. Monarch weapons are also a form of strength!</p><p>Mo lang sneered and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>With the monarch weapon in his hand, the Golden Crow Crown Prince was more than capable of killing Lu Ming even if he could not unleash its full power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve said it before. Today is the day you die. Kill!”</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s voice was cold as he returned to his high and mighty self. He flapped his golden wings and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The monarch weapon’s power burst out with earth-shaking power.</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only one with a monarch weapon?”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said calmly. The space between his brows glowed, and the Tai Chi formation disk flew out. It expanded rapidly, and a Tai Chi pattern appeared on it, pressing down on the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk was a treasure on the same level as sovereign weapons. As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the power he could unleash became stronger and more mysterious.</p><p>The wings on the Golden crow’s back launched attacks one after another, but they were all blocked by the Taiji formation disk.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to attack. A few fingers of tribulation of chaos were pointed at the Golden Crow.</p><p>The Golden crow’s eyes narrowed and his Saint power burst out. His golden wings shone with golden light and flew out of his body, turning into a huge three-legged golden Crow. With a flap of his wings, raging flames spread and extinguished Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation.</p><p>“Press!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind moved. The Tai Chi formation plate seized the opportunity and pressed down on the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>The Golden Crow let out a long cry and pounced toward the Tai Chi formation disk. It crashed into the formation disk and sent it flying.</p><p>Then, the Golden Crow flapped its wings and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the fighting ring, motionless. His face was calm as if he did not see the sovereign weapon that was pouncing at him.</p><p>As the Golden Crow neared Lu Ming, a pill furnace appeared in his hand.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace!</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace quickly grew to the size of a mountain. The lid of the elixir furnace opened and a shocking suction force erupted.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed one of the cauldron’s legs and scooped the monarch weapon into the cauldron. He then quickly closed the lid.</p><p>He didn’t know what grade of treasure the Dayan elixir furnace was, but the pair of wings couldn’t break out at all.</p><p>“Return my monarch weapon!”</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince roared.</p><p>“If you’re still thinking about the monarch weapon, then worry about yourself! Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and used the divine sword technique. Two sword gleams shot out from his eyes and rushed into the Golden Crow crown prince’s body.</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s body trembled, and then the Tai Chi formation plate pressed down. A Tai Chi pattern covered the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more violent. He lifted the Dayan elixir furnace and threw it at the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was like a storm. The Golden Crow Crown Prince could not withstand it at all and was hit on the head by the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>With a thump, Crown Prince Jin Wu was knocked dizzy, his head almost split open, and his body fell heavily on the fighting stage.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Tai Chi pattern turned into the Yin Yang fish sword and pierced through the Golden Crow crown prince’s wings, making him scream in pain.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted the Dayan elixir furnace and smashed it on the Golden Crow crown prince’s head again. This time, the Golden Crow Crown Prince was severely injured. His head cracked open and blood flowed out. The divine Sun Fire that filled his body was extinguished. He was on the verge of death.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the Tai Chi formation disk and the Dayan elixir furnace and stepped on the Golden Crow first crown prince’s head.</p><p>“Stop, Lu Ming. My big brother is the number one prodigy of the Golden Crow clan. If you kill him, the Golden Crow clan will never let you off!”</p><p>The second golden Crow Prince roared.</p><p>“The wind race won’t let you off either!”</p><p>Mo lang followed suit.</p><p>“Hehe, do you think that there is still room for reconciliation between me and the Golden Crow Tribe?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a look of disdain on his face. He had already killed several crown princes of the Golden Crow clan. The two sides were mortal enemies. How could they ease the tension?</p><p>If he didn’t kill the crown Prince, would the Golden Crow race let him go?</p><p>As for the wind race!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at mo lang, if the wind race wants a fight, I, Lu Ming, will accept it. As for the Golden Crow Crown Prince, since he has stepped onto the life-and-death stage, he must die if he loses!</p><p>An absolute holy weapon sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he thrust it at the Golden Crow first Prince’s head.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The Golden Crow crown prince’s head was pierced by Lu Ming, and his soul was also destroyed.</p><p>The Crown Prince of the Golden Crow was dead!</p><p>what a powerful combat strength! This person’s combat strength is too shocking!</p><p>the son of chaos who controls the Laws of Chaos is indeed amazing. This is the third person in the yuan mountain sacred Academy who has controlled the strongest law!</p><p>it’s a pity that his cultivation is a little weak. It’s still difficult to compete with the strongest heaven’s favorites. However, when he grows up, he will be extremely terrifying!</p><p>Some people in the surroundings were discussing excitedly.</p><p>Yet another child of God had appeared. This was truly a Golden Age.</p><p>Not only were the Kings fighting for hegemony, but the philosophers were also fighting for supremacy.</p><p>The second golden Crow Prince and the others had extremely ugly expressions on their faces, especially those from the Golden Crow clan. They were all exuding a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>The Crown Prince of the Golden Crow clan was dead. The most powerful genius of the Golden Crow clan was killed by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>Most likely, if some of the older members of the Golden Crow clan were to find out about this, they would be enraged.</p><p>“Lu Ming, give me my brother’s corpse!”</p><p>The Golden crow’s second Prince coldly spoke.</p><p>“I’ll leave it to you. How can you be so naive? this is my trophy!”</p><p>“Moreover, don’t you see that a few of my friends are very interested in the Golden Crow meat?” Lu Ming smiled faintly and continued.</p><p>“You… You dare?”</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow was so angry that his entire body was trembling. He glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid? It’s not like I haven’t done it before!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a wave of his hand, he kept the corpse of the first golden Crow Prince. Then, he looked at the second golden Crow Prince and berated,” why aren’t you all getting lost? do you all want to come up and fight? I’ll take you on!</p><p>“You … Just you wait, Feng wuchen is in seclusion in the Holy battlefield. When he comes out, it’ll be the day of your death!”</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow was furious, but he did not dare to fight Lu Ming. After leaving behind a few harsh words, he left with mo lang and the rest.</p><p>brother Lu Ming is so powerful. There’s golden Crow meat to eat, chirpy!</p><p>Paopao rushed to Lu Ming’s shoulder and shouted excitedly.</p><p>“Let’s go back and eat golden Crow meat!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the mountain peak where he lived with the rest.</p><p>Not long after, a fragrant smell drifted out from the mountain and spread for ten miles. That night, the entire golden Crow entered everyone’s stomach.</p><p>Especially the nine elites of the desolate race. They ate until their mouths were full of oil, and even the bones were not spared. They were all swallowed by the nine youths of the desolate race.</p><p>Even so, they were still not satisfied. Their eyes lit up, and they wondered if they should catch a few more to eat..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
