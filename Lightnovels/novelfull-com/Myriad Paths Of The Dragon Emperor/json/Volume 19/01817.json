However, if it was someone from the older generation, especially an Emperor-level powerhouse, who made a move on Lu Ming, he would have to make a trip to that force.</p><p>His words sent a chill down all the forces ‘spines.</p><p>With the old man’s combat power, if he really went to the mountain Gate of any force and started a massacre, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>Therefore, the Emperor-level experts of the WAN clan did not dare to attack Lu Ming unless Lu Ming was seeking his own death by attacking the Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made Wan Zhengyang’s heart turn cold.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming wanted to kill him in front of the Emperor-level experts of the WAN family?</p><p>At the thought of this, he was extremely terrified and cried out mournfully,” “Forefather, save me, save me!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s easy to break if you’re too hard. Although you’re talented, the senior from the Dayan elixir Palace can’t protect you forever. You’d better leave some room for improvement!”</p><p>The Emperor-level expert from the WAN clan coldly spoke.</p><p>“Leave a lifeline? Haha, what a joke, leaving you guys a chance to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, full of disdain.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to reconcile with the WAN family, the Sirius tower, and other forces. It was either one of them died or the other party died. Would the other party let Lu Ming off if he showed mercy?</p><p>Since that was the case, why should he leave a way out?</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s life is mine. What can you do about it?” he said.</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, his cold killing intent undisguisablc.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s liver and guts were torn apart as he struggled madly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed. A terrifying force gushed out like a storm, blasting into Wan Zhengyang’s body.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang let out an unwilling scream. Then, his body exploded with a bang, and his body and spirit were destroyed.</p><p>Everyone in the mine looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang was dead. Lu Ming actually dared to kill Wan Zhengyang in front of the WAN family’s Emperor-level powerhouses.</p><p>“Find… Die!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out from the WAN clan’s Emperor-level expert. A terrifying aura burst forth from his body, causing the sky to tremble and the earth to rumble.</p><p>Lu Ming was pushed back by this aura. However, his eyes were still determined. He looked at the Emperor-level powerhouse from the WAN clan fearlessly.</p><p>The Emperor-level expert from the WAN clan was filled with killing intent. He glared at Lu Ming coldly, wishing he could kill Lu Ming with a single slap.</p><p>But in the end, he didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>There were many people in this mine from various major forces. If he killed Lu Ming, the news would definitely spread and alert the expert from the Dayan elixir Palace. Then, the WAN family would face a terrible disaster.</p><p>As for him, he would probably be killed by the experts of the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>Therefore, he endured it and slowly restrained his aura. However, his killing intent became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although the senior from the Dayan elixir Palace said that he wouldn’t interfere in a battle between peers, as your combat strength grows stronger and you continue to provoke our Wan family, it’s impossible for our Wan family to not retaliate. Even if the Emperor-level figures don’t make a move, the people of the absolute Saint realm can. Otherwise, you won’t be able to survive if we fight to the death!”</p><p>The WAN clan martial sovereign’s eyes gleamed with a cold light as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong now. No one in the younger generation of the WAN family could compete with Lu Ming.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s combat strength would become stronger. According to elder Kong, Lu Ming could continue to hunt down the people from the WAN family, and the WAN family would not be able to retaliate?</p><p>How could that be possible?</p><p>Since Lu Ming’s strength had already surpassed that of the younger generation, they could also send people of the older generation to deal with Lu Ming. As long as they did not go too far, such as directly sending an Emperor-level expert, they believed that the other party would not say anything.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll take all the absolute Saints at once. I won’t let uncle Kong find trouble with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As long as the other party’s Emperor-level powerhouse did not dare to make a move, an absolute Saint would only bring pressure and motivation to Lu Ming, making him move faster.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned around and swaggered away.</p><p>The WAN family’s Martial Emperor’s eyes flickered with crazy killing intent, but he did not dare to make a move in the end. He could only watch helplessly as Lu Ming left.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s combat strength has already reached this level? To be able to kill Wan Zhengyang, that’s truly shocking!”</p><p>not necessarily. Just now, Lu Ming relied on the little girl’s help to render Wan Zhengyang defenseless. The little girl should be a terrifying divine beast, but Lu Ming’s combat strength is indeed shocking!</p><p>among the younger generation of the ancient Moon Holy Land, Lu Ming is already at the peak. Other than a few monstrous talents, I’m afraid no one is his match!</p><p>In the mine, many people were discussing. What happened just now would probably spread to the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming made his way to the Phoenix Palace. Not long after, he arrived at the Phoenix Palace and released the Phoenix Spirit from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Huang Ling’s complexion was much better. After she came out, she immediately looked around.</p><p>“This is the Phoenix Palace!”</p><p>When Huang Ling realized that she was in the Phoenix Palace, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Huang Ling looked at Lu Ming and asked with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Wan Zhengyang, Falcon, I’ll get my revenge sooner or later!”</p><p>Huang Ling gritted her teeth and a cold light flashed through her eyes.</p><p>I’m afraid you can’t get your revenge because they’re already dead!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What? They’re dead? You … You killed them?”</p><p>Huang Ling was dumbfounded.</p><p>yes, I should say that bubble and I worked together to kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you have a breakthrough in your cultivation?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked again.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang and Falcon had reached the great saint perfection and were extremely powerful. It was beyond her expectations that Lu Ming could kill them.</p><p>my cultivation hasn’t broken through, but my spirit body has evolved. Phoenix spirit, you should recuperate first. When you’re better, call Long Chen and find me at the Dayan elixir Palace. I’ll show you something good!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Huang Ling nodded. Lu Ming’s combat strength was already very strong. Now that his spirit body had evolved, his combat strength was even more shocking. With bubbles, it was possible for him to kill Wan Zhengyang and the rest.</p><p>“What good stuff?”</p><p>She was curious about the ‘good stuff’ that Lu Ming mentioned.</p><p>“Haha, come to the great Yan elixir Palace and find me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, turned around, and walked away.</p><p>After returning to the great Yan elixir Palace, Lu Ming went into seclusion to cultivate, comprehending the finger of calamity of chaos and the sealed scroll of the nine scrolls of the array Dao.</p><p>Seven days later, Huang Ling and Long Chen came together.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s the good thing you said you wanted to show us?”</p><p>Huang Ling blinked her eyes and asked curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Dayan elixir furnace flew out. It stood on the ground and said,”That’s it, the Dayan elixir furnace!”</p><p>“The Dayan elixir furnace?”</p><p>The two of them were curious. They had seen it before.</p><p>the alchemy fire in the Dayan elixir furnace can temper the spirit body and allow the spirit body to evolve…</p><p>Lu Ming explained the effects of the Dayan elixir furnace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
