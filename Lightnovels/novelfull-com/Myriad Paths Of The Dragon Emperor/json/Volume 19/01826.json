She had also mastered the laws of King path and her combat strength was shocking. She had crossed a level and defeated her opponent.</p><p>...</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s expression became uglier and uglier.</p><p>He had invited Ouyang Wushuang, Lu Ming, and the others to the banquet with the purpose of beating Ouyang Wushuang at the banquet. He wanted to sweep away Ouyang Wushuang’s side with a sweeping force. In the end, he would force Ouyang Wushuang to agree to help him fight against Ouyang wudao when he lost all his confidence.</p><p>But now, Long Chen and Feng Ling had been fighting above their level, and the momentum he had accumulated before had disappeared.</p><p>Huang Ling floated down and returned to her seat.</p><p>sixth brother, I’ve said before that a high cultivation level also represents a high combat strength. Cultivation level is only one of the factors that determines combat strength. There are many other factors that determine the strength of combat strength!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said and laughed in a carefree manner.</p><p>“Hrnph, ninth brother, no matter how strong they are, they are only great saints in the great mastery. They can defeat great saints in the peak, but can they defeat great saints in the Great Perfection? Will the two of them be of any use in this test?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji coldly snorted.</p><p>No matter how strong Long Chen and Phoenix spirit were, they were only equivalent to two powerful Supreme Saints at the peak. How could they affect the overall situation?</p><p>This test wasn’t about who was stronger in a battle of the same level.</p><p>“What’s the rush? isn’t the competition not over yet?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang smiled faintly.</p><p>“The competition isn’t over? They had already competed in the great sage great mastery. Were they going to compete in the great sage minor mastery? Hehe, ninth brother, what’s the use of a great sage in the minor mastery realm in this test? Are you going to die?”</p><p>“Ninth brother, don’t tell me you’ve invited someone from the great sage minor mastery?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s repeated questions were filled with sarcasm.</p><p>At the same time, his gaze swept across the crowd and finally landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>On Ouyang Wushuang’s side, the people from the purple flame villa were all at the peak of the great saint realm and the great saint perfection realm. Long Chen and Huang Ling had both revealed their cultivation, and the only one who had not revealed his cultivation was Lu Ming.</p><p>If he was a great sage initial, then it could only be Lu Ming.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sixth brother, I just said that having a high cultivation level doesn’t mean that your combat strength is high!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang added.</p><p>“How can I not know this? However, even if one’s cultivation is low, there must be a limit. He’s just a great sage minor mastery. Even if he can fight a higher level like the previous two, what’s the use? he’s only equivalent to a figure in the great sage great mastery. I’m afraid anyone here can defeat him!”</p><p>ninth brother, at the end of the day, you’re not that strong. You’ve helped me deal with the first Prince. I’ll still say the same thing, I won’t mistreat you!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji rattled on and on.</p><p>However, he did not see the expressions of mo lang, the Golden Crow sixth Prince, and the other people from Gu Yue Holy Land. He also did not see the expressions of the people from the purple flame villa.</p><p>The great sage lower mastery was equivalent to a great sage upper mastery? To Lu Ming, it was not valid at all.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang ignored Ouyang Wuji and looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, do you want to play?” he asked.</p><p>“Alright, let’s play!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, beat them up. Chirpy!</p><p>Bubbles waved her small fists and cheered for Lu Ming.</p><p>“This pervert is going to make a move!”</p><p>The people from the purple flame villa looked at Lu Ming with deep fear in their eyes. However, they naturally would not warn the sole divine temple. They would be happy to see the sole divine temple suffer after being humiliated like that.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubble’s small head, then stepped out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>it’s this lecherous fellow. He’s a complete piece of trash. He dared to flirt with Junior Sister Qiuyue on the street and was sent flying by my palm. Now, he’s still acting!</p><p>A young man from the sole holy temple laughed in disdain.</p><p>“So it’s this person, he really has guts!”</p><p>The other person from the divine temple sneered.</p><p>“Everyone, this person is not simple …”</p><p>Mo lang from the Skywolf tower wanted to remind the Supreme talent of the only sacred temple.</p><p>what do you mean by not simple? isn’t he just a great sage lower tier? are you looking down on us because my sole divine temple lost two matches? ”</p><p>Yu Shu’s gaze swept towards mo lang, causing mo Lang’s heart to skip a beat. He then shook his head and kept his mouth shut.</p><p>These people from the only divine temple were very arrogant and looked down on mo lang and the others. During this period of time, mo lang and the others had been ridiculed. Since these people did not listen to him, he was too lazy to say anything.</p><p>“Boy, let me tell you. You’re just a great sage minor mastery. There’s no great sage minor mastery here to fight with you. You must challenge him. In two days, I’ll ask a Junior Brother to play with you!”</p><p>One of the Supreme talents from the sole divine temple looked at Lu Ming with a mocking expression.</p><p>you only know how to challenge people of the same level. How can you be considered a heaven’s pride expert? you’re just trash. Since you’re a heaven’s pride expert, you must fight above your level. All of you, as long as you’re in the great sage realm, can come up and fight!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorites from the divine temple, including Ouyang Wuji, were all stunned.</p><p>What did Lu Ming say?</p><p>As long as it’s an eminent Saint, he can fight it out. Is this kid crazy?</p><p>A mere great sage minor mastery actually dared to make such a bold statement, saying that he could fight anyone in the great sage realm?</p><p>Did he really think that the people here were all trash?</p><p>Everyone here was a top-tier heaven’s pride expert. It was almost impossible for an ordinary warrior to fight a great sage in the lower mastery realm, not to mention that they were all heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>This kid was absolutely crazy!</p><p>hahaha, this kid, could it be that he’s gone crazy after being hit by my palm last time?”</p><p>The young man who had sent Lu Ming flying previously burst out laughing.</p><p>He couldn’t even block a single palm from him, and he still dared to say that he could even fight a great sage. If he wasn’t crazy, what was he?</p><p>“Ninth brother, did you really invite this person? I’m afraid you haven’t seen much of the world!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji sneered.</p><p>A great sage lower mastery could fight a great sage in the Great Perfection realm, and he was a top heaven’s pride expert. He didn’t believe that there was such a person in the world.</p><p>“So much nonsense, do you dare to go up or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated and looked down at the only divine temple, mo lang and the rest.</p><p>Mo lang and the rest felt their hearts skip a beat when Lu Ming’s gaze swept over them. They did not dare to look Lu Ming in the eye and lowered their heads.</p><p>They knew that they were not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>I’ll kill this kid. He has been staring at Junior Sister Qiuyue since he arrived. I want him to know what kind of trash he is!</p><p>A young man from the only holy temple shouted coldly and rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>The aura on his body bloomed. He was an expert at the peak of the great saint realm.</p><p>senior brother, go easy on him. Don’t kill him with one move. It’ll be boring!</p><p>The young man who had sent Lu Ming flying with a single palm on the street shouted.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the other party indifferently.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>die! the young man bellowed and struck out with his palm. A huge khaki palm grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This person controlled the law of the earth, and his strength was astonishing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. It was a very simple punch..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
