Huang Ling also had a clearer understanding of the matters of the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>...</p><p>this time, the other Prince has also come to the ancient Moon Holy Land. His bloodline is familiar with the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan. I’m afraid he will invite the experts from these forces to help’</p><p>Finally, Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Are you guys mainly inviting the young heaven’s pride experts this time?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>that’s right. The ancient emperors have set a rule that allows the princes to invite their own geniuses to help them pass the test. After all, connections are also a form of strength, especially when it comes to ruling an ancient empire!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained.</p><p>“Who else did you invite besides Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang smiled bitterly, my faction only has good relations with the Phoenix Palace and the celestial Bird Palace. I went to the celestial Bird Palace before but was rejected!</p><p>“Oh, I do have a few people I can recommend to you. Let’s sec if you can convince them!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang asked.</p><p>“Young sect master, and Long Chen!” Huang Ling said with a smile.</p><p>“What? Young master sect is also in ancient Moon Holy Land?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>of course. Back then, the young sect master. Long Chen, and I entered the Hunyuan sect together. Of course, he’s in the ancient Moon sanctuary!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I’ll definitely pay my respects!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Then I’ll send a message to Long Chen first!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling. She then sent a message to Long Chen.</p><p>Not long after long Chen returned to the divine elephant sect, he received the news from Phoenix spirit and rushed to the Phoenix Palace. He was also surprised to see Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>After Ouyang Wushuang explained his purpose, Long Chen agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them headed to the Dayan elixir Palace.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that young sect master would actually be the new hall Master of the great Yan elixir Hall!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang sighed as he stood outside the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>In ancient times, the great Yan elixir Hall was famous all over the world. Naturally, Ouyang Wushuang had heard of it.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came out.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also surprised to see Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained his purpose for coming.</p><p>“Ancient sun sacred land? Alright, I agree. When do we leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while and agreed.</p><p>In fact, even without Ouyang Wushuang’s matter, Lu Ming had planned to make a trip to the ancient sun sacred land soon.</p><p>The only sacred Hail was in the ancient sun sacred land.</p><p>Qiu Yue had been taken away by an expert from the sole divine temple. It was very likely that she had become a disciple of the sole divine temple.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had another idea.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was the Hunyuan sect’s Silver successor. For at least twenty years, he had to listen to Lu Ming. If he could help Ouyang Wushuang control the shenyuan Empire, this powerful force would definitely stand on Lu Ming’s side. They could even be used by Lu Ming.</p><p>To Lu Ming, this was definitely beneficial.</p><p>He had already decided that he would definitely help Ouyang Wushuang obtain victory and become the Crown Prince of the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>“With the help of the young sect master, this trip is not in vain. We can set off at any time!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang revealed a happy expression.</p><p>Since Lu Ming could become the Golden inheritor of the Hunyuan sect, his potential was definitely shocking. Even if his cultivation level was still weak, his combat strength was definitely not weak. He would be a great helper.</p><p>In addition, Phoenix spirit and Long Chen were also silver inheritors like him, so their combat strength was definitely not weak.</p><p>“Ouyang, in the future, you don’t have to call me young master sect in front of outsiders. Just call me Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded.</p><p>Soon after, they arrived at Phoenix Palace. When Huang Ling reported to the palace Master that Lu Ming and Long Chon were also going to shenyuan Empire, the palace Master was overjoyed.</p><p>Two months ago, the news that Lu Ming had killed Wan Zhengyang had spread like wildfire. His combat strength was unparalleled. With Lu Ming participating, Ouyang Wushuang’s chances of winning would increase greatly.</p><p>Even the palace Master of Phoenix Palace, who had been prepared to send the other paragons of Phoenix Palace, had canceled the plan.</p><p>The most powerful genius of the Phoenix Palace had been in seclusion at a critical moment and could not come out. The other geniuses were not as good as Feng Ling, so it was useless for them to go.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and of course, bubbles followed Ouyang Wushuang and stepped onto the Phoenix Palace’s teleportation formation. They left the ancient Moon sanctuary and headed towards the ancient sun sanctuary.</p><p>Of course, Phoenix Palace couldn’t teleport directly into the ancient sun sacred land. They teleported to a city on the outskirts of the ancient sun sacred land and then flew to the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>On the way, Ouyang Wushuang told everyone about the situation in the ancient sun sacred land.</p><p>Ancient yang Holy Land and ancient Moon Holy Land were equally famous, but their structure was completely different.</p><p>In the ancient Moon Holy Land, many forces were in a confrontation, fighting with each other, each dominating a region.</p><p>There were at least 20 powerful forces in total.</p><p>&Nbsp; but the ancient sun sacred land was different. It only had four factions.</p><p>There were only four forces in the vast ancient sun sacred land, each occupying a vast territory and having existed for countless years.</p><p>These four forces were the only holy temple in the shenyuan Empire, the purple flame villa, and the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>One must know that the ancient yang Holy Land’s overall power was not weaker than the ancient Moon Holy Land, and might even be stronger. One could imagine how strong these four forces were. Each Force’s strength was far above the Phoenix Palace and the WAN family.</p><p>Among them, the Daluo heaven sect was the most powerful, suppressing the other three forces.</p><p>This time, there were a total of three princes who were qualified to participate in the fight for the crown prince’s position.</p><p>The other three forces in the ancient yang sacred land each supported a Prince.</p><p>The strongest sect, the Daluo heaven sect, supported the first Prince, Ouyang wudao.</p><p>The only divine temple supported Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>The purple flame villa supported Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>It was obvious that if a Prince became the Crown Prince, the faction that supported him would gain the friendship of the divine Yuan Empire. This would have a huge impact on the situation in the ancient sun sacred land.</p><p>The Daluo heaven sect was especially powerful. If they supported the Crown Prince, Ouyang wudao, to become the Crown Prince, the Daluo heaven sect would join hands with the shenyuan Empire in the future. The other two forces would be in a very difficult situation.</p><p>In order to fight against Ouyang wudao, who was supported by the Daluo heaven sect, Ouyang Wushuang and Ouyang Wuji went to the ancient Moon Holy Land to seek help from the heaven’s favorites.</p><p>As they flew, the vast land flitted under their feet. After that, they saw a huge city that was boundless. That was the imperial capital of the divine origin Empire, which was also known as the divine origin imperial capital.</p><p>When they entered the divine origin imperial capital, they could clearly see that some of the buildings had been destroyed. The divine origin Empire had just experienced a civil war. The war was incomparably intense, and it was said that even Emperor-ranked experts had died in the war. The divine origin imperial capital had also suffered serious damage and had yet to be repaired.</p><p>With Ouyang Wushuang leading the way, they were unimpeded and entered a continuous stretch of palaces. This was the Imperial Palace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
