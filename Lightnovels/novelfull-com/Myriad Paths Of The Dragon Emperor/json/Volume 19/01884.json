He pulled out the celestial Emperor’s sword?”</p><p>A powerful Martial Emperor from the Heng family swept his gaze over the crowd, and his powerful Emperor aura made it hard for everyone to breathe.</p><p>“I don’t know.

Which force is this expert from? ”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and made a guess in his heart. However, he did not stop and headed towards Vientiane tower.
