He was the leader of another of The Six Forces in barren city. He was also an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>...</p><p>This time, he was facing a desolate race member in the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, the desolate race’s combat strength was slightly stronger than the beast from before. After a dozen moves, the leader of the faction was killed.</p><p>After that, almost all the people who went up were outsiders.</p><p>it seemed like the desolate race was very curious about the outsiders, and wanted to see how strong they were.</p><p>However, more than a dozen people went up in a row, and none of them won a single round. They were all killed.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that be it the desolate race or the ferocious beasts, their combat strength was very high. In a battle of the same level, they could completely suppress rhe martial arts experts from the outside world.</p><p>the desolate race seems to have extremely strong bodies. The laws they use are also related to strength. They have infinite strength. They are indeed a race that loves to fight!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>After that, there were more than a dozen battles. Without exception, there were no winners among the outsiders and they were all killed.</p><p>The remaining outsiders were in despair. They couldn’t even win a single battle, let alone winning a hundred in a row. This was completely impossible.</p><p>At this moment, the light on the wall dimmed.</p><p>The day’s cage battle ended, and it continued on the second day.</p><p>That night, Lu Ming, bubbles, and Qiu Yue sat cross-legged and cultivated in silence.</p><p>The three of them had no fear of fighting at the same level, and they believed that they would win a hundred battles in a row.</p><p>The next day, the Deathmatch continued.</p><p>The ones who went up were still outsiders, but the outcome was the same as yesterday. Almost all of them were killed. One person wanted to escape, but he was mercilessly killed by the desolate race’s experts.</p><p>On the third day, there was finally a heaven’s favorite with profound battle prowess who won a round.</p><p>For the next ten days, the Deathmatch did not stop. Every day, the cage battle arena was filled to the brim. It was clear how fanatical the desolate race was towards battle.</p><p>Hundreds of people from barren city had died in battle.</p><p>But there were few victors.</p><p>Even if they won, they would have to participate in the second and third Deathmatch the next day.</p><p>The later the battle, the stronger the battle prowess. Therefore, almost no one could win ten battles in a row, let alone a hundred.</p><p>“The outsiders” combat power is actually so weak?”</p><p>they are indeed very weak. My desolate race is the true Battle Race of the world!</p><p>“The outsiders can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>During this period of time, waves of such voices sounded out in the surroundings of the cage battle arena.</p><p>In the past ten days, it was not Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>Time flew by and another ten days passed.</p><p>On the twenty-first day, the group of them came to Lu Ming s Secret chamber.</p><p>“You, go out and fight to the death!”</p><p>One of the brawny men pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is it finally my turn?”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>He wanted to see if the desolate race would really give him his freedom after winning a hundred battles.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, you can do it! Brother Lu Ming will definitely win!</p><p>Bubbles waved her small fists and cheered for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>“You … Be careful!”</p><p>Qiu Yue muttered after some thought.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then left with the desolate race.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming walked along a passageway and entered the cage battle arena.</p><p>Only when they truly stepped into the cage battle arena did they feel the magnificence of the arena. The surrounding grandstands within a radius of a hundred miles were filled with people, and there were at least over a million people.</p><p>the desolate race’s strength has probably exceeded our imagination!</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and was secretly shocked.</p><p>It seemed that the yuan continent was not as simple as it looked.</p><p>Just like Yuan mountain, on the surface, there were only nine sacred lands. The powerful forces within the nine sacred lands were extremely powerful. The forces outside the nine sacred lands were all ordinary Emperor-level forces, and their strength was not very strong.</p><p>However, no one knew that in this isolated land, there was an ancient race, the desolate race, living in seclusion. They were so powerful that they probably surpassed many of the powerful factions in the Holy Lands.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings, and the surrounding desolate race members were also sizing him up.</p><p>“This person is so young. What is his cultivation level?”</p><p>1 just reported that it’s a duel between great sages. This means that this person has the cultivation of great sages!</p><p>he’s such a young great sage. It seems that he’s a heaven’s favorite from the outside world. 1 wonder how strong he is?”</p><p>On the grandstand, the members of the desolate race were in a heated discussion.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, a huge beast rushed out of a door.</p><p>This ferocious beast had the shape of a Tiger. Its entire body was covered with scales. It was exactly the same as the ferocious beast that mo Qingshan had fought with previously, it was obviously of the same race, but its cultivation was in the great sage great mastery realm.</p><p>The beast roared and pounced at Lu Ming the moment it saw him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed. Holy power surged and condensed into a long spear.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and the ground trembled, lie dashed out like a bolt of lightning at an astonishing speed. He approached the beast in an instant and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>The spear was like a flash of lightning as it pierced towards the beast’s head.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, accompanied by the roar of the beast. The beast’s head was pierced by Lu Ming and nailed to the ground.</p><p>The entire place fell silent, then burst into loud cheers.</p><p>in one move, he killed a fierce beast of the same level. His speed was like lightning.</p><p>“What shocking battle strength! He killed a Tiger scale beast of the same level with one move!”</p><p>no wonder he’s reached the great saint realm at such a young age. He must be a genius from the outside world.</p><p>“Someone from the outside world has finally appeared!”</p><p>At that moment, a desolate race expert entered the scene and dragged away the corpse of the Tiger scale beast.</p><p>“Do you choose to continue or rest and fight another day?”</p><p>A burly man with a battleaxe on his back stood in the sky and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eight again!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered without hesitation.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The burly man nodded and left.</p><p>Not long after, a figure stepped out of a large door and walked into the cage battle arena.</p><p>This person looked to be in his fifties. lie was wearing a piece of animal skin and his upper body was naked, revealing his strong muscles.</p><p>This was an expert of the desolate race, and his cultivation level was also at the great sage realm.</p><p>However, he looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression. As soon as he stepped into the field, a huge Mace appeared in his hand and he stared at Lu Ming cautiously.</p><p>Lu Ming had just killed a Tiger scale beast of the same level with one move. His combat strength was definitely shocking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the man. The Saint energy in his hand condensed into a long spear that was a thousand meters long and he whipped it ar rhe man.</p><p>The burly man from the desolate race roared as his muscles bulged. Powerful energy surged into his Mace as it came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, as the long spear swept past, the man screamed and his body was sent flying like a cannonball. He flew for thousands of meters before he stopped and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, this person would have been dead.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He then looked up into the sky and said/’Nextl”</p><p>The crowd burst into an uproar. He had been defeated in one move again.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A voice came from the sky.</p><p>As the person from before retreated, another desolate race expert walked out.</p><p>However, just like before, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
