He didn’t dare to continue fighting, and his figure flickered into the distance.</p><p>Luo pokong revealed a trace of unwillingness. Ills body moved and also headed into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase.</p><p>Although his strength was stronger than Luo pokongs, there was a limit to it. If Luo pokong was determined to leave, with his terrifying speed of penetrating laws, he would not be able to stop him.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Seeing Luo pokong and Kong lang retreat, Feng wuchen didn’t dare to continue fighting. He roared and turned into a gust of wind, fleeing into the distance and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The others also abandoned their opponents and fled frantically.</p><p>damn it, at least this kid escaped quickly. Next time, I’ll definitely destroy him!</p><p>Desolate li cursed. He was very unhappy.</p><p>He was an invincible existence among the younger generation of the desolate race. This was the first time he had been beaten so badly in a battle with someone of the same generation.</p><p>“Luo Tianyi, fhankyou!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Luo Tianyi and smiled.</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me,”</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled and said,” I was in seclusion. I heard that there was a battle here as soon as 1 came out. I came to take a look. 1 didn’t expect it to be you. It’s a pity I’m too late!</p><p>“Not too late, just in time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming is also familiar with Luo Tianyi?”</p><p>so many experts have gathered. It’s truly shocking!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also familiar with Luo Tianyi. With Luo Tianyi, there were too many geniuses on Lu Ming s side.</p><p>He already had five King’s bodies. In addition to his own chaotic body, the power was too shocking.</p><p>and there are so many beautiful women. I’m so envious!</p><p>Someone sighed, and many people immediately agreed.</p><p>Luo Tianyi, Qiu Yue, and Feng Ling were all beautiful women who had stunned the world. Any one of them was one of the top beauties in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, the three of them were familiar with Lu Ming. How could he not be envious?</p><p>“This kid is such a womanizer. I wonder how my sister is doing. With her arrogant temper, would she be able to endure it? Tm really looking forward to it!”</p><p>Xie nianjun chuckled.</p><p>Many people turned to look at Xie nianjun. Could it be that this proud daughter of heaven from rhe ancient Saint clan knew Lu Ming?</p><p>“The battle is over. Let’s go!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said and turned to leave.</p><p>The geniuses of the ancient Saint clan followed behind Xie nianjun as if she was their leader.</p><p>After that, some people also turned around and left.</p><p>“Huang Ling, desolate force, you’re both injured. Let s heal first!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Huang Ling and the rest.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Huang Li, Long Chen, Qiu Yue, and a few other injured people sat in the air, consumed elixirs, and began to heal.</p><p>Not long after, Huang Ling was the first to finish her healing.</p><p>She had the undying celestial phoenix body, and her life force was extremely exuberant. She was said to be undying, and no matter how serious her injuries were, she could recover very quickly.</p><p>After that, Long Chen and Qiu Yue also ended their healing. Their injuries weren’t that serious.</p><p>Only the desolate power was left. He had taken the desolate power head-on, and his body had been pierced with a few holes. He was severely injured.</p><p>At this moment, his muscles wriggled and the holes were filled up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura burst out from desolate Li’s body.</p><p>“This is … The aura of an absolute Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes widened and he revealed a look of joy.</p><p>After a huge battle, desolate power had actually broken through and entered the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, this was normal. Desolate Power’s cultivation had long reached the great saint perfection realm. He was the closest to the absolute Saint realm among them. After this period of cultivation and the battle just now, it was not surprising that his potential had been stimulated and he had broken through in one go.</p><p>hahaha! Desolate power has broken through to the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>The other members of the desolate race were also overjoyed.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others also looked happy.</p><p>With a breakthrough in desolate power, their strength would become even stronger in the future.</p><p>It would not be so easy for Feng wuchen to deal with them.</p><p>If desolate li broke through to the absolute Saint realm, he would still be able to fight Feng wuchen.</p><p>Some people were watching from afar, and those who had not left were also shocked.</p><p>Desolate li had broken through to the absolute Saint realm. An absolute Saint with a King body was definitely powerful. Coupled with Lu Ming’s terrifying combat strength, Lu Ming and his group would become a force that could not be underestimated in the yuan mountain Saint Academy.</p><p>during this period of time, many people in the yuan mountain sacred Academy are breaking through. After a period of time, I’m afraid there will be an even more exciting clash in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>that’s right. In fact, there are many King physiques whose cultivation hasn’t reached the Saint realm yet. When these people all enter the Saint realm, the collision will be even more intense. That will be a true great era!</p><p>there’s still the strongest group of people who have been cultivating in the Holy Zhi battlefield. When they break out of seclusion, they’ll probably be even stronger. We have to work hard too. Otherwise, we’ll become stepping stones for others in this great era!</p><p>Some of the geniuses were discussing. They felt pressured, but they were also filled with anticipation.</p><p>Everyone wanted to burst out with brilliant sparks in this brilliant great era and be remembered by everyone.</p><p>I lu hu hu …</p><p>In the heavens and earth, endless Origin Energy gathered towards the desolate power.</p><p>“Give him a hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and a large number of raw gemstones exploded, turning into rolling raw energy that surged towards the desolate power. Long Chen and the rest also took out large piles of raw gemstones and exploded them.</p><p>As the vast amount of origin Qi was absorbed by the desolate power, his aura became stronger and stronger. Rolling Saint power shot into the sky like smoke.</p><p>After a few hours, the aura of the desolate power was retracted, and he opened his eyes.</p><p>hahaha, Long Chen, you’d better hurry up and cultivate. Otherwise, I won’t have any opponents!</p><p>Desolate li laughed out loud and then looked at Lu Ming.’Lu Ming, when are you going to have a big fight with me?”</p><p>‘Tm not free!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected him directly. He would not have a good life if he was entangled with this battle maniac.</p><p>Desolate li touched his head helplessly, causing many people to laugh.</p><p>let s go back. Luo Tianyi, do you want to go together? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Luo Tianyi.</p><p>“Alright!” Luo Tianyi nodded with a smile. She was extremely charming, causing the young men from the divine elephant sect, Phoenix Palace, and the desolate race to stare ar her.</p><p>Other than Feng Ling and Long Chen, the others were all very curious.</p><p>Luo Tianyi, the Holy successor of the Jade Lake divine Palace, was a peerless beauty. She actually helped Lu Ming and seemed to be very familiar with him. She even listened to him.</p><p>This made many people’s imagination run wild.</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her eyes. She looked at Lu Ming and then at Luo Tianyi. No one knew what she was thinking!</p><p>Soon, the group returned to their residence and gathered in a spacious courtyard..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
