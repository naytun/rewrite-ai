He wanted to retreat back to the mountain of the alchemy furnace.</p><p>...</p><p>The true Emperor was too strong. Even with the help of the great evolution pill formation, he was no match for the true Emperor. He might have a chance of survival if he entered the cauldron mountain.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor said coldly. He took a step forward and entered the area of the pill Furnace Mountain. With a wave of his hand, a small Golden Pagoda flew out. Then, it grew in the wind and turned into a hundred thousand feet tall, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. This force was too strong. He had no choice but to stop and control the Grand Yan formation to set up layers of defense around him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant Pagoda came crashing down. A terrifying force came crashing down on Lu Ming like a storm. The defense set up by the great evolution elixir formation let out a terrifying roar and exploded continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was blasted to the ground and he was forced to take more than a dozen steps back. With every step he took, a huge pit was blasted into the ground. After more than a dozen steps, Lu Ming stabilized himself and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>If he didn’t have the DA yan elixir furnace to protect him, he would probably not have been just injured.</p><p>despicable! A few true emperors working together to deal with a junior!</p><p>Huang Ling clenched her fists, and so did Long Chen.</p><p>They wanted to help, but there was nothing they could do. A battle like this wasn’t something they could interfere with. A true Emperor could probably kill them with a single breath.</p><p>“Hand over the great evolution elixir Scripture and the great evolution elixir furnace, then kneel down and destroy your cultivation. I might let you die a little easier!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor placed his hands behind his back and looked down at Lu Ming from above as he spoke coldly.</p><p>Don’t even think about it!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his eyes filled with an unyielding look.</p><p>“Your bones are quite tough, but I’ll see how long you can last!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor stretched out a palm and pressed down in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant Pagoda trembled and the terrifying attack pressed down on Lu Ming. Lu Ming used the great evolution elixir furnace and the great evolution elixir formation to block the attack. However, most of the power of the great evolution elixir formation was used to block the true emperors of the Sirius tower. The remaining power could not block the true emperors of the WAN family at all.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace trembled and Lu Ming’s body was hit by a terrifying force. His bones cracked and blood oozed out of his skin.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated continuously, coughing out blood continuously. His clothes were stained with blood.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still standing straight. His eyes were filled with determination and unyielding spirit.</p><p>Kneel down!</p><p>The WAN clan’s true Emperor shouted.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!</p><p>Lu Ming roared. His long hair fluttered in the wind and the mountain of alchemy furnace glowed. Rays of light surged towards the WAN clan’s true Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually thinking of counterattacking.</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor pressed down with his palm again and the Halo collapsed. The terrifying power made Lu Ming retreat again and again, vomiting blood.</p><p>Above him, the giant tower burst out with a terrifying pressure that confined the surroundings, making it difficult for Lu Ming to retreat and rush into the mountain of alchemy furnaces.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor’s cold voice rang out once again. The giant tower exploded with another wave of energy and blasted Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming retreated again and his injuries became more serious. However, he still stood upright.</p><p>“If I don’t die, I’ll definitely kill all of you from the five Forces!”</p><p>Lu Ming howled, his unyielding voice spreading in all directions.</p><p>His voice was filled with unshakable conviction and a cold killing intent.</p><p>If he didn’t die, he would definitely kill all the people of the five Forces!</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>In such a situation, Lu Ming was still unyielding and dared to shout out such a voice.</p><p>This kid was terrifying. If he didn’t die, the future would be unpredictable!</p><p>Many people had such thoughts.</p><p>Even the WAN family’s true emperors, the Sirius tower’s true emperors, the three-legged golden crow’s true emperors, and many other Emperor-level powerhouses felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>“You won’t have such an opportunity!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor said, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>This kid was too extraordinary. Even if he couldn’t get anything today, he had to kill him and get rid of future trouble.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor took another step forward, and a shocking aura burst forth from his body. Light spots bloomed on his body as terrifying weapons flew out one after another. The Qi of battle weapons converged, and hideous cracks appeared in the void.</p><p>It was obvious that the WAN family’s true Emperor had used all his strength to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>sigh, a few true emperors actually ganged up to bully a great saint realm junior. Ancient Moon Holy Land’s power is really getting worse and worse!</p><p>At this moment, a sigh could be heard.</p><p>Then, everyone saw an old man walk out of the mountain of pill furnaces.</p><p>This old man was extremely old. His eyes were cloudy, his hair was about to fall out, and his face was full of wrinkles.</p><p>His aura was dispirited, and he held a walking stick in his hand as he walked over step by step.</p><p>“Uncle Kong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This old man was the old servant of the Dayan elixir Palace, dan Kong.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor glanced at uncle Kong and found that his qi and blood were really weak, just like an ordinary old man who had never cultivated.</p><p>However, it was obviously impossible for an ordinary old man to appear in such a situation.</p><p>he’s just an old man who’s about to enter the grave. He’s never been born. Even if I tell you, you won’t recognize him!</p><p>Uncle Kong squeezed out a faint smile.</p><p>“You want to help Lu Ming?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s true Emperor asked.</p><p>“Of course. Lu Ming is now the hall Master of the Dayan elixir Hall. I have to ensure his safety!”</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability to do so!” The WAN clan’s true Emperor’s eyes were cold, and his killing intent grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>whether I have the ability or not, I have to try. Anyway, this old life is going to be buried soon, so what’s the harm in dying!</p><p>Uncle Kong said with a smile.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor shouted and pressed his palm down. A shocking aura burst out from the giant Pagoda and pressed down on uncle Kong. The power was far stronger than when he attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that he did not use his full strength when he attacked Lu Ming just now. He wanted to force Lu Ming to reveal the great evolution elixir Scripture and so on.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s expression didn’t change, but the walking stick in his hand was waved.</p><p>When the staff was swung, it began to grow rapidly, turning into a sky-high staff that struck the giant tower.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying force spread out in all directions, causing the giant Pagoda to shake unceasingly before being sent flying. Uncle Kong’s walking stick also rapidly shrank, returning to its normal size as it was held in his hand.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>This old man who had suddenly appeared had displayed shocking battle prowess and was actually able to block an attack from a true Emperor of the WAN family.</p><p>Could it be that this old man was also a true Emperor?</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Uncle Kong’s combat strength was beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had previously guessed that uncle Kong was most likely a Martial Emperor, but he had never thought that he was actually a true Emperor, a middle Emperor powerhouse.</p><p>“So you’re also a true Emperor!”</p><p>The WAN family’s true Emperor’s gaze turned serious.</p><p>“So what if he’s a true Emperor? do you think that you can protect Lu Ming on your own? He must die today!”</p><p>The true Emperor from the Sirius tower broke the great Yan elixir formation and came to the side of the WAN family’s true Emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
