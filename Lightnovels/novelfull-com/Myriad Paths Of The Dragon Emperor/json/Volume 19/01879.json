He had broken through ro the great saint perfection, and his aura had skyrocketed.</p><p>Around him, pieces of raw gemstones exploded and turned into rolling original Qi, which surged into Lu Ming’s body and turned into Saint energy.</p><p>There were two Saint hearts in Lu Ming’s body. Now that he had reached the perfected Supreme Saint realm, his Saint power was extremely strong.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming’s aura was restrained.</p><p>I’ve gained a lot from this cultivation. I’ve made a breakthrough in my cultivation and reached the great sage perfection. I’ve also mastered 80% of the primal Chaos tribulation finger. It’s time to go out!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Last time, he had killed the Golden Crow Crown Prince, if the wind race came out of seclusion, he didn’t know if they would take revenge.</p><p>Although killing was forbidden in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, as long as one didn’t step onto the life-and-death battle stage, they would be fine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still worried.</p><p>Lu Ming strode towards the exit of the purgatory Valley.</p><p>He was very fast and there were no obstacles. In a short while, Lu Ming had left the divine ability, purgatory Valley.</p><p>it seems like bubbles is still cultivating!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, then his expression changed.</p><p>The moment he came out, he seemed to have received a message from a jade talisman.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Jade voice transmission talisman and scanned it with his spiritual senses. His expression changed abruptly.</p><p>It was the news from the Phoenix Palace. Huang Ling and the others were in danger.</p><p>in fact, some of the paragons of the divine elephant sect in the Phoenix Palace had been sending him messages continuously. Previously, he had been in the purgatory Valley and could not send messages in at all. However, they did not give up and continued ro send messages. Now that Lu Ming had come out of seclusion, they naturally received the news.</p><p>“The wind race and Luo pokong!”</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. Then, he circulated his Saint energy and his figure was like a ray of light, cutting through the void.</p><p>At this moment, be it Qiu Yue, desolate power, Huang Ling, or Long Chen, all of them were in danger.</p><p>The four of them were no match for Feng wuchen and Luo pokong even when they joined forces.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear in Luo pokongs hand burst out. It turned into rays of spear radiance and pierced towards the vital points of Qiu Yue and desolate power.</p><p>Each of the Spear s radiances contained the power of the law of penetration. They could penetrate everything, even other laws.</p><p>At this moment, two parts of desolate Li’s body had already been pierced by the spear radiance. The front and back of his body were completely penetrated and blood was flowing out.</p><p>If not for the special Constitution of the desolate race, making them extremely strong and resilient, they would not have been able to continue fighting.</p><p>However, he still stood in front of Qiu Yue.</p><p>The two of them used all their strength to fight Luo pokong.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Desolate power barely dodged one of rhe spear radiances, or else he would have been pierced through.</p><p>At this moment, Feng Ling and Long Chen were not in a much better state. Even with Feng Ling’s terrifying vitality, her face was pale.</p><p>“Where’s Lu Ming? where’s he hiding? let him come out and fight me.”</p><p>Luo pokong shouted coldly.</p><p>He had lost face when he was defeated by Lu Ming last time. Now that he had broken through to the Saint realm, he must humiliate Lu Ming.</p><p>“If Lu Ming makes a move, I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle it!”</p><p>Desolate li grinned.</p><p>“Lu Ming defeated this person previously!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>hahaha, so that’s how it is. It turns out that you’re Lu Ming s defeated opponent. You still have the face to come here? ”</p><p>Desolate li laughed.</p><p>“Shut up. If Lu Ming dares to show up, I’ll make him kneel in front of me and beg for mercy. It’s a pity that he’s like a tortoise hiding in its shell now. He doesn’t dare to show himself!”</p><p>Luo pokong sneered.</p><p>“Are you looking for me?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice came from the distance.</p><p>Then, a beam of light flew over from the distance at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, it arrived at this place.</p><p>This rainbow light did not stop at all. It rushed directly towards Luo pokong. Huge prison-suppressing steles appeared one after another and pressed down on Luo pokong.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Luo pokong let out an angry roar and thrust his long spear at the illusionary stele. The illusionary stele exploded, and Luo pokong’s body trembled and he took a few steps back</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The light faded and Lu Ming’s figure appeared.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The hearts of Huang Ling and the others moved, and they revealed happy expressions.</p><p>Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and the desolate race were also delighted.</p><p>They did not know why, but as long as they saw Lu Ming, they would feel at ease. It was as if Lu Ming had the ability to turn the tide.</p><p>“Lu Ming, long time no see. I wonder if you can turn the tide in this situation?”</p><p>In the distance, Xie nianjun muttered among the ancient Saint clan members, this person is the son of chaos? ”</p><p>Those who had never seen Lu Ming before could not help but whisper, their faces filled with curiosity and anticipation.</p><p>Would the son of chaos appearance change the outcome of the war?</p><p>Qiu Yue, Huang Li, go and help Huang Ling and rhe rest. Leave this person to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Qiu Yue and desolate charged at Feng wuchen. With the help of Qiu Yue and desolate, the situation was finally stabilized.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, you’ve come at the right time. Today, i ll trample you under my feet and let you suffer all kinds of humiliation!</p><p>Luo pokong looked at Lu Ming, his eyes glimmering with cold killing intent.</p><p>Now that he had become an absolute Saint, his combat strength had increased dramatically. He was 100% confident that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>He was forced to take a few steps back by Lu Ming earlier because he was in a hurry and did not unleash much of his strength.</p><p>“Loser, since you’ve already been defeated once, you’ll never be my opponent in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, full of confidence and the belief that he would not lose.</p><p>“This time, you’re the one who’s defeated. Kill!”</p><p>Luo pokong s long spear trembled and hundreds of spearlights appeared, stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Smail tricks! Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and punched continuously. Tall prison-suppressing steles appeared one after another, suppressing everything.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The spear radiance exploded and was suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and broke through the sniping of the spear radiance, blasting it toward Luo pokong.</p><p>Luo pokong’s face darkened. His long spear buzzed and pierced toward Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A huge prison-suppressing stele appeared and clashed with the long spear.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Phantom image of the prison-suppressing stele exploded and the long spear trembled continuously. Lu Ming and Luo pokong’s bodies trembled at the same time and they retreated a few steps.</p><p>The hearts of many of the spectators in the distance trembled.</p><p>he’s so strong, lie can resist an absolute Saint King body alone!</p><p>Someone asked in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming s cultivation base was revealed as soon as he made his move. He was a perfected great saint.</p><p>For example, Feng Ling and the others only managed to resist Feng wuchen after the four King bodies joined forces.</p><p>However, Lu Ming alone could fight with Luo pokong.</p><p>as expected of the son of chaos. His combat strength is truly terrifying!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Luo pokong’s face also darkened, and the killing intent in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The long spear was like a bolt of lightning, piercing towards Lu Ming. The power of the penetrating law was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He took a step forward and continued to bombard with his prison-suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves, and neither of them had a clear winner..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
