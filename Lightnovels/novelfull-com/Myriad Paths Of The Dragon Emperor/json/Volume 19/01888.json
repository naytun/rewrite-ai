You have to do something valuable!</p><p>Beside the Wu area, a burly man with a gloomy expression transmitted a message to them.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Wu Chu and the rest were blocking the risk for them? How laughable. They were clearly being used as bait, and if there was danger, they would attack.</p><p>It was the same now. They were asked to resist while they seized the sword source. Who knew if they would run away after seizing the sword source?</p><p>I’m not going anyway. If you want to fight, you can fight for it. I’m leaving the team. I’d rather risk my life in the sword tomb alone!</p><p>A brawny man shook his head and refused. He then wanted to leave.</p><p>But at this moment, chief Wu suddenly moved. He rose up and clawed at the strong man.</p><p>The brawny man had never expected Wu Chu to attack him. Even with his initial absolute Saint cultivation, he couldn’t use it. Furthermore, Wu Chu was a perfected absolute Saint. The difference was too great. He couldn’t fight back at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Wu Chu’s claw cracked the head of the strong man.</p><p>The brawny man roared. His eyes were fixed on the scene, filled with anger and unwillingness.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Wu Chu’s power gushed out, and the man’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>His soul was also destroyed in an instant.</p><p>it’s too late to leave now. Go and stop the other party, or you’ll die!</p><p>Chief Wu sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and the rest coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s and Qiu Yue’s eyes were gloomy while the rest of them were pale.</p><p>On the other side, the dozen or so people also looked at them in surprise.</p><p>“Hehe, we haven’t even started the war, and there’s already internal strife!”</p><p>One of them sneered.</p><p>no matter what they’re up to, get ready. We’re going to take the sword source, and these people are going to die!</p><p>One of the people with the strongest aura said coldly.</p><p>Not only did they want the sword source, but they also wanted to annihilate Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>How could finding the source of the sword be faster than killing and snatching the treasure?</p><p>At Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Alright, let’s make our move!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in agreement.</p><p>The others were helpless and could only nod.</p><p>i’ll tell you to start. You guys just attack and catch the other party off guard!</p><p>Chief Wu transmitted his voice and then suddenly roared,” kill!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest dashed towards the dozen people in a flash.</p><p>However, before he could get far, Lu Ming’s palm was like a knife, slashing down with all his might. A force as large as a mountain suddenly blasted towards the other party.</p><p>“You’re looking for death! Kill them!”</p><p>The leader of the opposing party shouted angrily. More than a dozen people burst out and charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>run! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. He and Qiu Yue turned around abruptly and rushed toward chief Wu and the rest.</p><p>The others were stunned for a moment, then immediately fled in other directions. How could they really go up and court death?</p><p>“You guys are looking for death!”</p><p>When chief Wu saw that Lu Ming and the rest were running in the opposite direction and were charging towards them, he was instantly enraged.</p><p>they’re really using us as bait. What a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and rushed towards Wu Chu and the rest with Qiu Yue. The other party also rushed towards Wu Chu and the rest.</p><p>“Little brat, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>A burly man at the absolute Saint stage launched a fierce attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw a punch. He crushed the other party’s attack in a crushing manner and then collided with the other party’s palm.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The bones in the other party’s hand were directly shattered. He retreated rapidly, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue did not linger in the battle. They charged past and dashed into the distance.</p><p>Then, the other side’s dozen or so people had already rushed over. All kinds of attacks poured towards Wu Chu and the others. The two sides immediately started to fight.</p><p>“Damn it, you little bastards, I’ll kill you all sooner or later!”</p><p>kill! chief Wu roared. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>Lu Ming was so bold. Not only did he want to escape, but he also led the other party to them. He should be hacked into pieces.</p><p>“Old man, save your own life first. Goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud. He and Qiu Yue did not stop and they flashed away at top speed.</p><p>The dozen people saw that Lu Ming was just two young people and did not care at all. They only stared at Wu Chu and the rest and launched a fierce attack.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had left the battlefield and appeared tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>The two of them didn’t have a fixed direction. Their goal was to find the astral treasure Lotus, but they didn’t know where it would appear in the sword tomb, so they could only search randomly.</p><p>The two of them randomly chose a direction and ran forward.</p><p>Not long after, they discovered two sword sources. On the side, there were about twenty sword fiends guarding them.</p><p>Since they had encountered each other, the two of them naturally would not give up.</p><p>Although these swordfiends were strong, with their combat strength, they would naturally not be too difficult.</p><p>The two of them rushed toward the sword source as fast as lightning.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The swordfiends had also discovered Lu Ming and his companion and charged at them. Their bodies were like divine swords, bursting with dazzling sword-light as they slashed at the two.</p><p>Qiu Yue waved her hand, and two curved blades, one hot and one cold, flew out. They continued to spin, and the hot and cold collided, erupting a destructive power that swept forward.</p><p>A few sword fiends, regardless of whether they were at the eminent Saint stage or the absolute Saint stage, were instantly crushed into pieces by the destructive energy.</p><p>With Qiu Yue’s battle-power, she could kill ordinary lower-tier absolute Saints in an instant.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attacks were more direct. He kept punching out with both fists, and an illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and pressed down.</p><p>All the sword Qi that was suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele instantly collapsed.</p><p>Even two absolute Saints in the upper tier were killed instantly.</p><p>The twenty or so sword fiends were cleared out by the two of them in a few breaths. They each grabbed a sword source and flew into the air, leaving the place.</p><p>Ten thousand miles later, in a Valley, Lu Ming carefully sized up the sword source in his hand.</p><p>From the outside, the sword source looked like a real combat sword. However, when Lu Ming’s spiritual senses scanned it, he could clearly sense that it was formed by a type of sword energy.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Devouring power burst out from Lu Ming’s palm. The sword source exploded under the devouring power and turned into a stream of energy that was devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully. He realized that the energy of the sword source seemed to be formed by thousands of tiny sword gleams. When they were integrated into Lu Ming’s Saint energy, they were like countless sharp sword gleams that were tempering Lu Ming’s Saint energy, making it stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming started to refine it.</p><p>More than two hours later, Lu Ming had refined all the energy in the sword source.</p><p>my Saint energy has indeed become stronger and more condensed!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Although the improvement was not big, it was only a small amount. However, this was only one sword source. If he had enough sword sources, his cultivation would definitely increase very quickly. It would be many times faster than normal cultivation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
