Haha, now, 1’11 ask someone to release your two friends!</p><p>The expert from the desolate race laughed and looked at Lu Ming with a look of admiration.</p><p>Not long after, Qiu Yue and bubbles walked out of a door.</p><p>take these two entry tokens. No one will touch you when you walk around the ancient Savage barren realm in the future!</p><p>Two tokens appeared in the hands of the desolate race experts and they flew towards Qiu Yue and bubbles.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, all the best. Hit them, chirpy!</p><p>Bubbles waved her small fists and cheered for Lu Ming. She then climbed onto Qiu Yue’s shoulder.</p><p>Qiu Yue took the token and cast a complicated look at Lu Ming before flying to the stands at the side.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to challenge me now or do you need to recover first?”</p><p>The desolate race expert asked.</p><p>there’s no need to recover. Let’s fight now!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If he wanted to fight, then he should end it quickly and win the hundred-game winning streak in one go.</p><p>alright, you’re confident. Great sage in the great circle, who wants to try? ”</p><p>The desolate race experts looked around the grandstand.</p><p>“I’ll fight him!”</p><p>A figure stood up from the stands and stepped out, landing in the arena. The aura from his body was that of a perfected Supreme Saint.</p><p>This person was very young and was a few heads taller than Lu Ming. Two giant hammers appeared in his hands, which looked like two water tanks.</p><p>Typically, those who entered the cage battle arena’s fourth beta were either fierce beasts or slaves. And those who flew down from the stands were desolate race experts who had come here to train.</p><p>it’s a wasteland. 1 didn’t expect him to be up in the first round!</p><p>the desolate land has a superior-grade heaven spiritual body. It’s one of the top geniuses among the younger generation of our clan!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up when they saw this young man. They didn’t expect that there would be such an important scene in the first round.</p><p>“Good, then you guys can fight to your heart’s content. This old master won’t disturb you any longer!”</p><p>The desolate race expert stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“Come on, show me your true ability and let me see your strength!”</p><p>Huang Di raised his two big hammers and smashed them against each other, making a loud sound. His eyes were full of strong fighting intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was rare even in the desolate race. The desolate race loved to fight, so they were naturally delighted to see him.</p><p>“Then let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His body glowed, and holy weapons flew out of his acupoints.</p><p>More than a hundred holy weapons were floating around Lu Ming.</p><p>sealing a holy weapon in your body. What a wondrous ability. Don’t be useless!</p><p>The desolate man grinned and took a step forward. He was like a cannonball as he charged towards Lu Ming. The two big hammers were smashing towards Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>Back then, Tian Chui had also used a hammer, but its power could not be compared to the desolate land.</p><p>The giant hammer fell and a terrifying howl was heard in the sky. The air was compressed and brought with it a terrifying storm that came crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held an absolute holy weapon in his hand. The Holy power in his body whistled and he slashed out.</p><p>The terrifying wave of air was directly split into two.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The Battle Sword and the giant hammer of the desolate land collided fiercely, creating a violent wind that swept in all directions.</p><p>Huang Di’s body trembled, and his burly body was forced to retreat. He only managed to stabilize himself after taking more than ten steps back.</p><p>a high grade heavenly spiritual body. The desolate race is indeed an ancient race. They really have many geniuses!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It had not been long, but among the desolate race elites that Lu Ming had encountered, there were already three people with superior-grade heavenly spiritual bodies. This was extremely shocking. In the outside world, a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body was definitely a top elite, an existence that was only second to a monarch body.</p><p>Without the king physique, who could compete with him!</p><p>But in the desolate race, they had encountered one after another.</p><p>However, he didn’t know that the wasteland was even more shocked.</p><p>He was a top genius of the desolate race. Among his peers, he did not have many opponents. Now, with his cultivation being two levels higher, he was actually being forced into a disadvantage by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Amazing, again!”</p><p>The barren land raised two big hammers and stomped on the ground, crushing toward Lu Ming like a mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword was like the wind, slashing out continuously and colliding with the sledgehammer in the wasteland.</p><p>Sparks flew everywhere as the two of them clashed for more than a dozen times. Every time they clashed, desolate land was forced to take a few steps back. After a dozen times, he had already retreated a great distance. His face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’m done, I’m done, 1 admit defeat!”</p><p>Desolate man picked up his hammer, turned around, and ran away, shouting that he admitted defeat.</p><p>He realized that Lu Ming’s strength completely crushed his. There was no need to continue fighting.</p><p>even the desolate land was defeated. Could it be that this person can really cross two levels and win loo consecutive victories? ”</p><p>he can’t even defeat a desolate land. There aren’t many people in the great sage perfection realm who can be his opponent!</p><p>“This level of combat strength is truly shocking!”</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>And on the highest grandstand, a few desolate race experts ‘eyes lit up.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept the surroundings.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just finished speaking when a voice was heard. Then, a burly figure soared into the sky and landed in the arena.</p><p>He was also a young man, and his body was even more burly than wasteland’s. He stood there like a mountain, giving off a sense of pride.</p><p>This was an undefeatable belief!</p><p>“Desolate power, it’s the desolate power!”</p><p>desolate power has already made his move. I thought he was going to stay until the end.</p><p>“Can the number one prodigy of the younger generation defeat Lu Ming?”</p><p>Many people even stood up from their seats and shouted excitedly when they saw the young man.</p><p>the number one genius among the desolate race’s younger generation? ”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke. He was surrounded by sounds and naturally heard it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you defeat me, you don’t have to fight anymore. I’ll count it as a hundred-win streak!”</p><p>Desolate said.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads. That was indeed the case. Within the great sage full circle, desolate power was an invincible existence. If he was no match for it, then the subsequent battles would be meaningless.</p><p>There was no need to talk about loo consecutive wins, any number of consecutive wins could be achieved.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He also wanted to see the combat strength of the number one genius of the desolate race.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Desolate took a step forward. It was as if an ancient beast was walking, causing the ground to shake.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, desolate li continued to step forward. With every step, the ground would shake. His aura became stronger and stronger. His muscles bulged, and he was filled with explosive power.</p><p>Finally, the desolate power was not too far away from Lu Ming. It threw a punch at him.</p><p>He punched with his bare hand, but the vibration that erupted was even more intense than when the wasteland swung the giant hammer.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He also threw a punch at the desolate power.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to fight the desolate power head-on?”</p><p>“In a direct confrontation, no one is a match for desolate power at the same level. Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation is two levels lower.”</p><p>“He probably doesn’t know the power of desolate power!”</p><p>On the grandstand, many thoughts flashed through the minds of the crowd. Lu Ming’s fist and the desolate Power’s fist collided fiercely..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
