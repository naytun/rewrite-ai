Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; the two figures trembled and retreated, stomping on the ground and causing it to rumble.</p><p>Lu Ming and desolate power retreated at the same time, shocking the audience.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, Lu Ming was not weaker than desolate power?</p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p>what a powerful force! This is the law of extremity!</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The desolate energy’s spiritual body was an upper-class sky spiritual body, and the laws it grasped were the extreme laws of the king path, which were exactly the same as Long Chen’s laws.</p><p>Extreme strength, extreme strength, boundless strength, breaking all techniques with strength!</p><p>Coupled with his cultivation as a desolate power Grand Sage, his power was truly shocking. With one punch, he could blow up a mountain and crack the earth.</p><p>“Alright, again!”</p><p>Desolate li saw that Lu Ming was facing him head-on and that he was his equal. Instantly, his fighting spirit burned to the extreme. A fanatical fighting spirit burst forth in his eyes as he rushed towards Lu Ming. He kept punching out with both fists, like cannonballs, towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and charged forward. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and punched continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming had never been afraid of anyone in a head-on confrontation.</p><p>Illusionary pieces of the prison-suppressing stele seemed to appear in Lu Ming’s fist. They had the power of millions of Jun and suppressed the heavens. Their strength was shocking.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them kept punching each other. It was direct, barbaric, and overbearing. The sky and earth rumbled, causing some people with weaker cultivation to turn pale and almost suffer internal injuries.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves in a row, but there was still no winner.</p><p>To be honest, desolate power was very strong. Every strike was like a bolt of lightning, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>Not many people could directly confront him like this in a direct confrontation.</p><p>Lu Ming was only able to resist the desolate power in such a way by relying on the prison suppressing heavenly technique and the power of the chaos laws.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what other tricks do you have? use them all!”</p><p>Desolate li roared.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>yes,” Lu Ming replied. The Laws of Chaos boiled and he suddenly pointed his finger.</p><p>Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>The terrifying finger force crushed towards desolate li. Desolate Li’s expression was extremely heavy.</p><p>die! he roared as a pair of boxing gloves appeared on his hands. He circulated his nomological laws to the extreme and punched out with all his might.</p><p>It was as if a star had appeared on his fist as he threw the punch at Lu Ming, clashing with the chaotic finger of tribulation.</p><p>This scene was shocking. It was as if the finger of a God had pointed at a star in the sky. Then, the star exploded, and desolate’s body retreated rapidly.</p><p>“It’s time to end this battle. Seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Following that, dense runes suddenly appeared on desolate Power’s body, trying to seal him.</p><p>Desolate Li’s expression changed. He used all his strength to struggle, but at this moment, Lu Ming pointed with his finger again.</p><p>A huge finger pressed down on desolate li, sending him flying thousands of meters away. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, the desolate power would not have been as simple as being injured.</p><p>hahaha, amazing, really amazing. Lu Ming, I lost!</p><p>Desolate force had lost, but he laughed heartily and did not seem to mind.</p><p>1 just have a few more tricks up my sleeve. I might not be able to defeat you in a head-on collision. You let me win!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>! win is! win. In! life and death battle, who wants to fight me head on? but we’ll fight again in the future. Next time, I’ll definitely win!</p><p>Desolate Li’s eyes were filled with battle intent.</p><p>“Alright, let’s fight again if there’s a chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He realized that these desolate race people were not bad. They were all very straightforward and did not have many schemes.</p><p>At that moment, the desolate race expert stepped down from the sky and landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>since you have crossed two levels and defeated desolate power, no one in the great sage full circle is your match. You are free!</p><p>A token appeared in the desolate race expert’s hand and he threw it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took it and revealed a look of joy.</p><p>He was finally free. Now, he could search for Berserker crystals in the ancient wilderness realm.</p><p>Lu Ming, the elders of the desolate race want to see you!</p><p>At that moment, the desolate race expert spoke again.</p><p>the desolate race’s elder wants to see me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“That’s right, I need your help!”</p><p>The desolate race expert nodded. This sentence was said through a voice transmission, so no one else could hear it.</p><p>“Since senior has invited me, I will definitely meet you!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head and agreed without hesitation.</p><p>alright, come with me. Desolate, you too!</p><p>The desolate race experts flew towards the sky above the cage battle arena. Lu Ming, desolate li, Qiu Yue and bubbles, who were in the grandstand, followed them.</p><p>They flew out of the cage battle arena and headed north.</p><p>“It’s so spectacular!”</p><p>It had been a while since he came here. This was the first time Lu Ming left the cage battle arena. He looked around.</p><p>This was an ancient city. There were all kinds of ancient buildings in the city. They were majestic, tall, and vast. One could not see the end of them.</p><p>The city was filled with people from the desolate race, and there was an endless stream of them.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a grand building and entered a large hall.</p><p>In the hall, there were a few burly, white-haired old men.</p><p>These old men didn’t seem to have any aura at all, and they looked like ordinary old men.</p><p>“Greetings, clan elders!”</p><p>The desolate race experts and desolate li bowed to the few elders.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>The old man in the middle raised his hand slightly and looked at Lu Ming with a look of admiration.”You are Lu Ming? I just heard the news that you defeated desolate power. You are two levels above desolate power. This is the first time I’ve seen someone with such combat strength in my life.”</p><p>“Senior is too kind, junior was just lucky!” Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>The few elders chuckled but did not comment.</p><p>little fellow, my desolate race has a matter that we need your help with!</p><p>The old man in the middle continued.</p><p>“You need my help? However, this Junior’s strength is too weak…”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He had never expected that the desolate race elder would look for him to ask for his help. However, he was only at the great saint realm. There were probably a lot of people in the desolate race who were stronger than him, so what could they possibly need his help with?</p><p>The old man smiled, come with me and you’ll know. Desolate Li, you kids, come at me together!</p><p>With that said, the few elders walked out. Desolate li and the desolate race experts followed.</p><p>Lu Ming hesitated for a moment before following them with Qiuyue bubbles.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a secret place.</p><p>There was a stone wall in front of them. Under the stone wall, there were three ancient altars. They seemed to have been there for countless years. In front of them, there were three ancient bluestone roads that led to the three altars, each of which was about a thousand meters away..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
