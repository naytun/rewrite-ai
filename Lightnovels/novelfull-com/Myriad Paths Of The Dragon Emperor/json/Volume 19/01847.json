He asked carefully.</p><p>...</p><p>“Luo pokong of the Daluo heaven sect!”</p><p>The young man in the lead said indifferently.</p><p>“You’re Luo pokong?’1</p><p>The Guard’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The Daiuo heaven sect had two kings in the younger generation.</p><p>There were two heaven’s favorites who had mastered the king path laws.</p><p>One of them was Luo cangqiong, and the other was Luo pokong.</p><p>Luo pokongs status in the Daluo heaven sect was second only to Luo cangqiong. Everyone in the ancient sun Holy Land knew him.</p><p>haha, brother Luo, welcome! Please forgive me for not welcoming you!</p><p>At this time, a laugh was heard. Yu Shu and a few young men stepped on the air and came over.</p><p>“Yu Shu, there’s a kid called Lu Ming. Is he in your one and only holy temple?”</p><p>Luo pokong asked.</p><p>“That’s right, he’s at the one and only sacred Hall. If brother Luo needs him, 1 can take you there!” Yu Shu said with a smile.</p><p>“Lead the way!”</p><p>Luo pokong stepped forward.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Yu Shu led Luo pokong and the others to Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>At this moment, in the courtyard where Lu Ming lived, he was chatting with Qiu Yue about the past. Suddenly, his expression changed and he looked out of the courtyard.</p><p>A group of people stepped on the air and stopped above the courtyard, looking down at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Luo pokong!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Luo pokong s eyes swept across Qiu Yue and then landed on Lu Ming.”Boy, you’re Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Not bad!” Lu Ming responded.</p><p>very good. Do you know that Qiu Yue is my brother Luo cangqiong’s woman? you dare to have any thoughts about her? I think you’re tired of living!</p><p>Saint power surged from Luo pokong s body, forming a powerful aura that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nonsense! When did I become Luo cangqiong’s woman? you tell him that it’s impossible between us!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted.</p><p>This made Luo pokong squint his eyes, and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Did you hear that? Qiuyue denied it herself, but that Luo cangqiong keeps sticking to her. Isn’t it embarrassing? Don’t you have any shame?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>impudent! Who Do You Think You Are? how dare you insult my elder brother? you must be tired of living!</p><p>Luo pokong shouted, and his cold killing intent bloomed.</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>arrogant! Lil cripple you now!</p><p>Luo pokong s gaze was cold. His aura grew stronger and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>He had heard of Lu Ming’s combat strength. He could defeat a sovereign with a superior-class celestial spiritual body in the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>However, his combat strength was not something that a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body could compare to.</p><p>His own spiritual body was also a superior-grade heaven spiritual body, and he had mastered the laws of the king path. His cultivation was at the great saint perfection. With such talent, he was almost invincible in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Why would he care about Lu Ming?</p><p>“Luo pokong, if you want to fight, I ll accompany you! ’</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted coldly as her two curved blades flew out. The laws of yin and yang revolved around her body.</p><p>Luo pokong s eyes narrowed slightly. Qiu Yue’s talent was not inferior to his.</p><p>He was not confident that he could fight her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems like you can only hide behind a woman!”</p><p>Luo pokong sneered and revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>“You don’t need to use such a low-level goading method. However, I really don’t need the help of others to deal with you! ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He took a step forward and appeared in the sky.”Come up and fight!”</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Luo pokong revealed a trace of joy. His body soared into the sky, and a long spear appeared in his hand. A terrifyingly sharp intent burst out from the long spear.</p><p>“Lu Ming is definitely not Luo pokong s match. He’s dead for sure in this battle!”</p><p>Yu Shu sneered.</p><p>Luo pokong’s talent was almost at the top of the younger generation. His spirit body and laws were at the top. No one could defeat him in a battle of rhe same level. Even if Lu Ming mastered the Laws of Chaos, his cultivation was so far behind. It was impossible for him to be Luo pokong’s match.</p><p>Although Luo cangqiong didn’t come, it would be the same if Luo pokong came.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Luo pokong shouted coldly. With a shake of his long spear, a terrifying spear radiance burst out toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming s body glowed, and more than a hundred holy weapons appeared. He held an absolute holy weapon in his hand and slashed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The combat sword slashed at the Spear’s gleam and a terrifying vibration was produced. The Spear’s gleam was shattered by the combat sword, but the combat sword in Lu Ming’s hand also shook violently.</p><p>what a powerful penetrating power! This is the penetrating law!</p><p>Lu Ming s heart stirred.</p><p>He felt that there was a penetrating power in the spear light. It was extremely terrifying, as if it could penetrate everything in the world.</p><p>That was the law of penetration, a type of King path law. It was said to be able to penetrate everything in the world, and nothing could block it. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s see how many shots you can take! ”</p><p>Luo pokong’s long spear trembled and hundreds of spearlights emerged. They made a sharp whistling sound and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a single thought, more than a hundred holy weapons shot out from around him. Each holy weapon was shrouded in the Laws of Chaos, and they bombarded the spear radiance.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sound of the violent collision reverberated through the sky. Then, Lu Ming’s more than one hundred Saint weapons were all knocked back. However, the Saint weapons were shrouded in the Laws of Chaos, which blocked the opponent’s attack.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at Luo pokong like lightning.</p><p>Close combat was a better choice to fight with someone who controlled the law of penetration.</p><p>Lu Mings figure neared Luo pokong. He activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art and punched out with both fists.</p><p>Pieces of the prison-suppressing stele’s illusionary shadow emerged and pressed toward Luo pokong.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear in Luo pokong’s hand continued to thrust out. The spear shadows, with a terrifying penetrating power, pierced the prison-suppressing stele’s illusionary image.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s shadow was pierced through and exploded in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to swing his fist and the illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele kept appearing.</p><p>The two of them clashed fiercely. The air was boiling, and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“A destructive attack!”</p><p>Luo pokong seemed to have lost his patience. He let out a long howl and circulated his Saint energy to the extreme. He became one with his spear and turned into a terrifying spear radiance, stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a terrifying sacred art that seemed to be able to pierce through everything.</p><p>The illusionary shadow of the prison-suppressing stele that Lu Ming had blasted out exploded and was pierced through.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cast his remarkable power and pointed his finger. The light of chaos curled around his finger and pressed down on his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger and the spear light clashed, creating a massive storm that spread in all directions.</p><p>In the end, the chaotic finger of tribulation crumbled, but the spear radiance of the other party also exploded, revealing Luo pokong’s figure. He retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and used the divine sword technique. Two rays of sword light shot out from his eyes and rushed into Luo pokong’s body. Luo pokong’s body trembled slightly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s holy weapons charged at Luo pokong again.</p><p>Luo pokong endured the piercing pain in his soul. He waved his long spear and blocked all of Lu Ming s holy weapons..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
