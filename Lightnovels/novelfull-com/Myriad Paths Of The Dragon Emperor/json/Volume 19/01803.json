The aura was scorching hot, and Lu Ming felt as if he was being burned when it got close to him.</p><p>...</p><p>However, a wonderful scene appeared. When the alchemy furnace approached Lu Ming, it shrank rapidly and finally turned into a ray of light, rushing into Lu Ming’s mind and disappearing.</p><p>The next moment, the elixir furnace appeared in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, emitting a brilliant light. At the same time, a large amount of information rushed into Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming instinctively sat cross-legged and began to digest the piece of information.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming finally opened his eyes.</p><p>the great Yan elixir furnace and the great Yan elixir Scripture. I didn’t expect that I would obtain the inheritance of the great Yan elixir Hall just like that!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his expression was a little complicated.</p><p>There were two main types of information that appeared in his mind. One was the great evolution elixir Scripture, and the other was a sacred book on elixir refinement.</p><p>the great evolution elixir Scripture is truly wondrous. Just like what the outside world says, it can use the laws of heaven and earth to refine elixirs. It has endless uses!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with surprise.</p><p>Of course, he only had a rough idea of the contents of the great Yan elixir Scripture. He was still far from comprehending it. He would need to spend time to comprehend it in detail later.</p><p>There was also another piece of information, which was the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>There had been powerful ancestral cultivators from the Dayan elixir Palace who had inscribed a powerful formation on this mountain and its vicinity. All the information was in Lu Ming’s mind and he could grasp it easily.</p><p>this place is protected by a great formation, and the origin Qi is extremely rich. It’s not a bad idea to live here in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Ta! Ta! Ta!</p><p>At this moment, a crisp sound rang out in the quiet stone room. This sound seemed to be the sound of a wooden stick hitting the ground.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Did the great Yan elixir Palace still have a successor?</p><p>Lu Ming was highly focused as he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The sound of tapping was getting closer and closer. Then, Lu Ming saw a figure walking out from the depths of the stone chamber.</p><p>It was an old man wearing grey clothes, but he was really old. There was not much white hair left, his body was thin, and the wrinkles on his face were like mountains.</p><p>He did not exude any martial arts aura. He looked like an ordinary old man.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. Since the other party had appeared in the Dayan elixir Hall, he was afraid that there was something unusual.</p><p>after so many years, someone has finally come!</p><p>An old voice came out of the old man’s mouth, but it was weak and seemed to be a little weak.</p><p>He opened his turbid eyes and looked at Lu Ming. He suddenly bowed to Lu Ming.’This old servant greets the new hall Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly waved his hand and a wave of energy lifted the old man up.”Senior, why is that? And who are you?”</p><p>I’m just a servant of the great Yan elixir Palace. I was ordered to guard the great Yan elixir Palace and wait for the arrival of its successor. Finally, before I was buried, a new successor of the great Yan elixir Palace came!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“I’ve become the successor of the great Yan elixir Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. The previous Hall Master said that anyone who can enter here is the successor of the Dayan elixir Hall. Otherwise, why would the Dayan elixir furnace enter your sea of consciousness and recognize you as its master?”</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>“Senior, what’s going on? What did this have to do with the Hunyuan sect’s inheritor? Can you explain it to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>it’s simple. The previous Hall Master was also the inheritor of Hunyuan sect. He was a silver inheritor!</p><p>Then, a token appeared in the old man’s hand. It was the silver inheritance token of the Hunyuan sect.</p><p>the previous sect master once said that the great Yan elixir Palace can only appear when the Golden inheritor of the Hunyuan sect appears. The Golden inheritor is the inheritor of the great Yan elixir Palace and the palace Master!</p><p>some time ago, I sensed through the silver inheritor token that the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor had finally appeared. So, I opened the great Yan elixir Palace and let it appear, waiting for the arrival of the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor. I didn’t expect the palace Master to arrive so soon. It seems like the palace Master is in the ancient Moon sanctuary!</p><p>The old man explained in detail.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization. No wonder there was a Hunyuan sect’s legacy token on the stone door. No wonder no one else, not even Huang Ling and Long Chen, could enter. He was the only one who could.</p><p>That was because the Grand Yan Hall was born for him alone. If he did not come, no one else would be able to obtain the inheritance.</p><p>But then, he thought of another problem.</p><p>The silver inheritance token could sense the presence of a gold inheritor.</p><p>Didn’t that mean that all the Hunyuan sect inheritors in the past could sense it? even some powerful existences knew that a golden inheritor had appeared?</p><p>It seemed that he had to be more careful in the future. Unless it was necessary, he could not expose his identity as the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. If some powerful beings harbored ill intentions and knew that he was the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor, they would probably kill him with one slap.</p><p>“That’s right, senior, where are the others from the great Yan elixir Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he asked again.</p><p>there’s no one else, only this old servant. In a few more days, I’m afraid I’ll also die. Fortunately, the heavens have eyes. Before this old servant dies, the hall Master came here and inherited the great Yan elixir Hall. This old servant can die in peace!</p><p>The old man said, his voice filled with sorrow.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled as he asked,’why is senior the only one left in the Dayan elixir Hall? It’s said that once one reaches the Martial Emperor realm, one’s lifespan will be unlimited and they’ll almost never die…”</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed very surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe that there were no Martial Emperor powerhouses in the Dayan elixir Palace.</p><p>In ancient times, the great Yan elixir Hall’s name shook the land of Mount Yuan. Its alchemy skills were unparalleled in the world, seizing the Fortune of heaven and earth, and it could even establish a sect in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Moreover, after so many years, the moment it appeared, it caused a commotion in all directions. Almost all of ancient Moon Holy Land’s major forces were mobilized, and even martial sovereigns appeared one after another. How could such a force not have a martial sovereign? Lu Ming did not believe it!</p><p>it’s true that a Martial Emperor’s lifespan is endless. However, no one can truly live forever!</p><p>The old man sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. Could there be a mistake in the rumors?</p><p>Palace Master, you probably don’t know this yet. In the Martial Emperor realm, one’s lifespan is endless. However, there will be a major tribulation. Every 33333 years, there will be a major tribulation. Those who pass it will be able to temper their cultivation and become stronger. They might even be able to reach a higher level. Those who can’t pass it will be turned into ashes by the major tribulation!</p><p>The old man’s explanation made Lu Ming’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>Every 33,333 years, a Martial Emperor powerhouse would face a great calamity. If they could not overcome it, they would be annihilated.</p><p>When one reached the Martial Emperor realm, they would not be able to rest easy and live forever. They would have to face a great calamity.</p><p>In that case, Martial Emperor powerhouses pursued strength more than those of other realms because they would die if they were not strong enough.</p><p>the tribulations of heaven and earth get more and more powerful each time. If a martial sovereign doesn’t advance, he’ll die under the tribulations. So what if he’s a martial sovereign? he can’t escape the punishment of the heavenly Dao!</p><p>The old man sighed, as if he was filled with endless emotions..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
