The other four had medium-grade heaven spiritual bodies. Each of them was very powerful. Their cultivation was either at the peak of the great saint or the great saint perfection.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how many people in the outside world know about the entrance to the wild Sanctuary?”</p><p>At this moment, an elder asked.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be many, at most a few!”</p><p>Lu Ming told him about ha Zheng.</p><p>the desolate race has yet to fully come into being. Therefore, these people can not be allowed to live!</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in the eyes of one of the elders.</p><p>“I’ll go out with Lu Ming to get rid of them!”</p><p>A middle-aged burly man spoke. This person was the desolate race expert who had brought Lu Ming to meet the desolate race elder in the cage battle arena. His cultivation level was at the Martial Emperor realm and his name was Huang Xu.</p><p>“Alright, you guys can go!”</p><p>The elders nodded.</p><p>The desolate race’s exit was naturally not the one that Lu Ming and the rest had entered previously. There were other exits, but this time, they still planned to exit from that entrance.</p><p>Everyone rose into the air, and not long later, they arrived at the exit. The desolate race experts opened the exit, and a vortex appeared in the sky. Everyone charged into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that they had appeared in the sky above the lake that they had entered previously.</p><p>He swept his gaze around, but there was no one around.</p><p>“Senior ruins, why don’t you enter my mountain and river diagram for the time being? i’ll go to barren city secretly, so as not to alert the enemy and scare ha Zheng and the others away!”</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>The members of the desolate race were too burly, so they would definitely attract attention when they walked on the streets.</p><p>Ha Zheng, on the other hand, had entered the ancient Savage barren realm before. If they were to swagger into barren city, they would probably alarm ha Zheng and make an early escape.</p><p>Barren ruins and the rest nodded. Lu Ming kept barren ruins, desolate li, and the rest into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and bubbles were the only ones who headed toward barren city.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest entered the barren city again, they felt that the atmosphere was completely different from the previous time.</p><p>Now, the atmosphere in the entire barren city seemed to be very depressing. The streets were also very depressed. Many shops were closed, and the restaurants were deserted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest passed by a towering mansion, a loud boom came from the mansion. A figure crashed through the wall and flew out of the mansion. He fell heavily to the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>It was a white-haired old man. He was very old and the wrinkles on his face were like mountains. He reminded Lu Ming of uncle Kong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, a few figures rushed out of the mansion. One of them was a middle-aged man who stepped on the old man’s face, causing his head to hit the ground heavily.</p><p>“Grandpa Shi…”</p><p>A delicate cry rang out.</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming realized that the other burly man was holding onto a young and beautiful lady.</p><p>“Young miss, let young miss Go. Otherwise, when old master and the others return, they won’t let you off!”</p><p>The old man didn’t care about his injuries and struggled to get up, trying to save the woman. However, the woman was kicked away by the burly man again.</p><p>“Your master still wants to come back? He should have died in the ancient Savage barren realm long ago. And even if he comes back, so what? would my ha family be afraid of your Huang family?”</p><p>The middle-aged man sneered and looked at the old man coldly,” “Old man, let me send you on your way!”</p><p>Then, a saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at the old man.</p><p>However, he didn’t strike down because a force flew out from the side and knocked his saber away.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted. His eyes were like lightning as they finally landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, was it you who attacked?”</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>“Looks like you’re not blind!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>brat, you’re courting death. How dare you meddle in my ha family’s Affairs? you’re a reckless fool!</p><p>The middle-aged man walked toward Lu Ming. When he saw Qiu Yue, he was stunned, this woman is not bad. I’ll give her to the young master. I’m sure you’ll be rewarded handsomely!</p><p>He did not know Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. Back then, although Lu Ming had caused quite a stir in the barren city, not many people had actually seen them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s saber flashed like lightning and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>But the next moment, he suddenly felt a chill on his neck. Then, he saw a headless body holding a saber. The body ran a few steps forward and then fell to the ground.</p><p>That was clearly his body. Then, he felt his vision go black, and he didn’t know anything.</p><p>After killing the middle-aged man, Lu Ming’s figure flickered a few times. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying force was directed at the remaining members of the HA family. These people did not have the strength to resist and were killed by Lu Ming directly. Only one person survived because Lu Ming deliberately left him alive. However, he was so frightened that his face turned pale and his body trembled. He fell to the ground weakly, and a foul smell came from his crotch.</p><p>He had actually peed his pants.</p><p>“Grandpa Shi, are you alright?”</p><p>The young woman quickly ran to the old man and asked with concern.</p><p>“Miss, I’m fine!”</p><p>The old man shook his head. Then, with the help of the young lady, he walked to Lu Ming and bowed.”This old man thanks young master for saving my life!”</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. I also have some grudges with the HA family, so I just took the opportunity. Senior, what happened in barren city? Why do I feel like something is wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“All, it’s still because of the savage barren ancient region …”</p><p>The old man briefly told him what had happened in barren city.</p><p>It turned out that many experts of barren city’s six strongest forces had followed ha Zheng to the ancient Savage barren realm, but only ha Zheng and hamenti had returned. The experts of the other six forces had never returned.</p><p>As a result, the situation in barren city had changed dramatically. Ha family was now the dominant family.</p><p>In the past, although ha Zheng was the number one expert in barren city with the cultivation of Emperor-to-be, the other six forces could still compete with the HA family if they joined forces.</p><p>But now, no one could resist the HA family.</p><p>Not long ago, the HA family had started to sweep all the forces in barren city. Anyone who resisted would be killed without mercy.</p><p>Previously, the six major forces had all been annihilated by the HA family.</p><p>The old man and the young woman belonged to the Huang family, one of the six big forces. The young woman was the daughter of the Huang family. As hammerte was a lustful man, he wanted to take the daughter of the Huang family and make her his concubine. That was why there was such a scene today.</p><p>Realization dawned on Lu Ming. Almost everyone from the other forces had died in the cage battle arena of the ancient Savage barren realm. It was not surprising that such a scene had occurred in the barren city.</p><p>young master, you should leave barren city now. They won’t let you off for killing the HA family!</p><p>The old man advised with good intentions.</p><p>leave? I don’t want to leave. You should go back and report this!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the only surviving member of the HA family.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The man from the HA family was stunned. Lu Ming did not kill him. Instead, he wanted to release him and let him go back to report the news.. What was happening?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
