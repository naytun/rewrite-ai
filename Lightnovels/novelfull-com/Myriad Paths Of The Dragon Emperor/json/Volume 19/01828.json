Madam…”</p><p>...</p><p>Qiu Yue mumbled to herself as the look of contemplation in her eyes became even more intense.</p><p>Her eyebrows were tightly knitted together, as if she was thinking hard about something.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yu Luan roared and charged at Lu Ming again. Flames filled the sky. In the sky, sabers and swords condensed from flames appeared. Like a storm, they charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>This move was Yu Shu’s strongest move. He had unleashed his sacred art to the extreme.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look and pointed his finger again.</p><p>Lu Ming had raised the power of the chaos finger of tribulation to its maximum.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his full strength in the previous finger attack.</p><p>&Nbsp; the chaos laws exploded, and the chaos tribulation finger was formed, crushing everything in its path.</p><p>All the weapons condensed by the flame exploded in an instant. Yu Shu’s expression changed drastically. With a scream, his body was blown away like a cannonball. He flew out of the fighting ring and flew a long distance before he fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was severely injured by this move. If not for his fire spirit body and tenacious vitality, his physical body would have exploded.</p><p>Yu Shu had been defeated, completely and utterly defeated.</p><p>Many people were silent. This level of combat strength had already exceeded their imagination.</p><p>A great sage minor mastery had actually defeated Yu kun, who was a great sage in the Great Perfection realm. Yu kun was a peerless genius. Such combat strength was simply unheard of.</p><p>Especially the paragons of the purple flame villa. They thought of how they had laughed at Lu Ming and the others when they first saw them. Now that they thought about it, they felt embarrassed and ashamed.</p><p>Some of the people from the sole divine temple were red in the face.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had said that they could challenge anyone who was at the great saint realm. They had even mocked Lu Ming for being crazy.</p><p>Now, it seemed that Lu Ming was very confident. On the other hand, they seemed a little ridiculous, like jumping clowns.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang laughed heartily.</p><p>sixth brother, so what? so what if you’re a great sage in the Great Perfection realm? you still lost. It seems that my side is stronger. Sixth brother, do you want to help me to get the position of Crown Prince?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face was extremely gloomy. He knew that his plan to suppress Ouyang Wushuang and make him help him fight against the first Prince, Ouyang wudao, had failed.</p><p>It was all because of Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Feng Ling!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s fists were clenched together as his eyes turned cold.</p><p>In the beginning, everything was going according to his plan, and everything was going smoothly.</p><p>However, after long Chen made his move, all his plans were thrown into chaos.</p><p>Long Chen and Feng Ling were extremely powerful. They were able to defeat the only heaven’s favorite of the sacred Hall.</p><p>However, this was not a big deal. No matter how strong Long Chen and Feng Ling were, they could not fight against Supreme Saints in the Great Perfection realm. It did not affect the overall situation much.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attack had completely disrupted his plan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength could even defeat Yu Shu. This level of combat strength could already affect the outcome of the battle. In this case, he did not have an overwhelming advantage. Why would Ouyang Wushuang help him?</p><p>“Ninth brother, this test will be a competition of overall strength. Although Lu Ming is strong, he’s alone. I’d advise you to help me!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face darkened.</p><p>“Oh, since that’s the case, we’ll see who’s stronger and who’s weaker during the assessment!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll see during the assessment!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said coldly.</p><p>All sorts of thoughts ran through the crowd’s minds, but Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Qiuyue, what’s wrong with you? You still remember the Lu family of fiery wind city? Do you still remember the mystical sword sect? Do you still remember the burning sun Empire?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was like a great Bell that resonated in the heavens and earth. He asked a series of questions in succession as if he wanted to penetrate deep into Qiu Yue’s heart.</p><p>“The Lu family of fiery wind city? Mystical sword sect? The Lu family of fiery wind city?”</p><p>Qiu Yue kept muttering to herself. Her eyes were blank. After a while, a pained expression appeared on her face. She let out a soft cry and shot into the sky. She turned into a ray of light and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Qiuyue…”</p><p>Lu Ming was about to give chase, but his figure flashed. A few of the temple’s geniuses blocked his path.</p><p>“Damn it, what did you say to Qiu Yue? Why was she so abnormal?”</p><p>“If anything happens to Junior Sister Qiuyue, you’ll die without a burial place!”</p><p>The Paragon of the sole divine temple shouted coldly, and a powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you trying to bully me with your numbers?”</p><p>let’s go! Long Chen said as he stepped forward and came to Lu Ming’s side. Huang Ling did the same.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji shouted coldly and stood up abruptly. A powerful aura burst out from his body as he looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a cold gaze.</p><p>At the same time, mo lang, the Golden Crow second Prince, and the rest were also staring at Lu Ming with unfriendly gazes.</p><p>If they could take the opportunity to kill Lu Ming today, they would be more than willing to do so.</p><p>“Sixth brother, the test hasn’t even started yet, and you’re already going to fight me? If this gets out, both of us will be disqualified. Wouldn’t that be too good for Ouyang wudao?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang also stood up and confronted Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s expression changed.</p><p>He did want to take the opportunity to cripple Lu Ming. However, Ouyang Wushuang was right. If the two of them started a fight first, the consequences would be unpredictable. Regardless of whether they would be disqualified or not, it would benefit Ouyang wudao.</p><p>“Hmph, ninth brother, let’s meet at the assessment!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji muttered to himself for a moment before he waved his sleeves and snorted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go first!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction that Qiu Yue had left in, frowning.</p><p>Something must have happened to Qiu Yue.</p><p>However, one thing was for sure. Qiu Yue’s body was not possessed.</p><p>If he was possessed by someone else and Lu Ming kept asking him questions, he would definitely not have this reaction.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I will definitely find out what you have been through.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was very cold. The only thing he could do now was to find out what Qiu Yue had gone through before he could find the right solution.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. He turned around and left the place with Ouyang Wushuang and the rest.</p><p>In Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion, Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang were sitting opposite each other at a stone table in a courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re here to ask me about miss Qiuyue. Do you know her? Are you really her young master?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang asked out of curiosity.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>yes. Lu Ming nodded. Qiuyue and I came from the same place. Before she came to the yuan continent, she was my servant…</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained his relationship with Qiu Yue.</p><p>“The only proud daughter of the divine temple is actually your maidservant!”</p><p>After listening, Ouyang Wushuang was amazed.</p><p>“But when Qiu Yue saw me earlier, she didn’t seem to recognize me at all. Something must have happened to her. Ouyang, have you heard any news about this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Earlier, Lu Ming came to look for Ouyang Wushuang alone to ask about this.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was the Prince of the divine origin Empire. He was in the ancient sun sacred land with the only sacred Hall, so he might know something..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
