He’s too audacious. Otherwise, we would have taken down Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the rest!</p><p>Mo lang said respectfully.</p><p>Oh, I’ve heard of that Lu Ming. He stirred up a storm in ancient Moon sanctuary a while ago. Unfortunately, the Wind Clan had not yet emerged at that time. Otherwise, we would have suppressed him long ago!</p><p>Feng wuchen sneered and said.</p><p>young master wuchen, we’ve also mentioned your name, but Lu Ming didn’t give us any face at all. He even said that if you’re not convinced, you can look for him directly!</p><p>The Golden crow’s second Prince chimed in.</p><p>“Arrogant and ignorant, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Beside Feng wuchen, another green-robed young man said coldly. This man was also a heaven’s favorite of the Wind Clan, but he was not as strong as Feng wuchen.</p><p>“You’re asking me to find him? Hehe, alright, I’ll go find him then. From now on, those people don’t need to stay in the yuan mountain sacred Academy anymore!”</p><p>Feng wuchen said indifferently. With his hands behind his back, he took a step forward and walked out.</p><p>The other geniuses of the wind race, as well as ink Wolf and the Golden Crow second Prince, followed him.</p><p>On the mountain peak where Lu Ming and the rest lived, there was an open space. Two figures were fighting fiercely, erupting terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>These two were long Chen and desolate.</p><p>After two months of cultivation, Long Chen’s cultivation had finally entered the great saint perfection. The moment he entered the great saint perfection, desolate power found him. The two of them had nothing to say and immediately engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The battle between the two was very similar. It was direct, brutal, and overbearing. It was like two ancient beasts fighting.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The trumpeting of elephants could be heard. Long Chen’s arms expanded several times as he circulated his nomological laws to the extreme. He punched out continuously with both fists. With every punch, a giant elephant rose into the air and crushed toward desolate li.</p><p>Desolate Li’s muscles bulged as a wild light shone in his eyes. He roared and continued to punch out. Each punch would destroy a giant elephant.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves before they retreated to the sides. They stared at each other like two wild beasts.</p><p>hahaha, awesome, this is awesome. How about we fight another day? ”</p><p>Desolate li suddenly laughed.</p><p>“That’s exactly what 1 want. Let’s have a great battle another day!”</p><p>Long Chen’s fighting spirit was not weak at all.</p><p>They looked at each other, feeling a sense of appreciation for each other, and a sense of regret that they had not met each other.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two of them controlled the same laws and fought each other. This would greatly benefit each other and allow them to find their own weaknesses.</p><p>Although he could also condense a figure with the same laws as himself after entering the purgatory Valley, it was condensed by a Grand array after all.</p><p>There was still a huge gap between it and a true genius or a real person.</p><p>Real people had thoughts and could understand. They could see through weaknesses and fight against each other. The effect would naturally be better.</p><p>The two of them stopped fighting and sat down cross-legged to absorb the orirocks to recover their true Yuan.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them opened their eyes at the same time and looked in the same direction.</p><p>In that direction, a terrifying tornado with destructive power swept toward the mountain they lived on.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Long Chen and desolate li roared at the same time. Their bodies shot into the sky, and they charged towards the tornado. Their fists continued to strike out, and terrifying fist forces were sent towards the tornado. After dozens of punches, the tornado was finally stopped.</p><p>The expressions of the two of them turned gloomy. The other party was too audacious, directly attacking them in their residence, wanting to destroy the courtyard they were staying in. This was a direct slap to their faces, a humiliation.</p><p>In the distance, a young man in a green robe was Walking in the Air with his hands behind his back. He was Feng wuchen.</p><p>“Two extreme King physique, this is really rare!”</p><p>Feng wuchen looked at Long Chen and desolate li in shock.</p><p>“Feng wuchen!”</p><p>Long Chen said with a serious expression.</p><p>this guy is Feng wuchen. He’s so pretentious. I’ll beat him until he cries later!</p><p>Desolate li grinned, his eyes filled with ferocity.</p><p>At that moment, on the mountain peak, other figures rose into the air and came behind Huang Li and Long Chen. A few of them were the elites of the desolate race, while the others were elites of the Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and Thunder God sect.</p><p>At the same time, the other heaven’s favorites of the wind race, ink Wolf, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, and the others also arrived and stood behind Feng wuchen.</p><p>The two sides drew their swords and their powerful auras met in the air.</p><p>The fluctuations here naturally alerted the paragons of the other peaks. One by one, they stood in the void and watched from afar.</p><p>it’s Feng wuchen! Feng wuchen has come out!</p><p>I knew it. Once Feng wuchen comes out, he will definitely make a move. He won’t let Long Chen and the others go easily. I wonder how they will deal with Feng wuchen!</p><p>“It seems like there’s going to be another intense battle!”</p><p>Many people spoke up, filled with anticipation.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had killed the Golden Crow Crown Prince. How would Feng wuchen treat Lu Ming and the rest?</p><p>Feng wuchen smiled faintly and said,” the two of you are rare talents. Come to me and work for me. I will make you my right and left arms. 1 will not treat you badly!</p><p>He still wanted to subdue desolate power and Long Chen. If he had the help of the two King physiques, he would definitely be able to have a place in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>“Help you? Take a piss and look at yourself, Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Desolate li immediately cursed.</p><p>he only knows how to suppress us with his cultivation level. He even wants us to join him. What a joke!</p><p>Long Chen also sneered.</p><p>They were all King physiques, so how could they rely on Feng wuchen?</p><p>Did Feng wuchen have the right?</p><p>Feng wuchen’s cultivation was only slightly higher now. Once they had a breakthrough, their cultivation would catch up to Feng wuchen’s and they would have no fear of him at all.</p><p>stubborn! Then I’d like to see what capital you have to clamor in front of me!</p><p>Feng wuchen’s face darkened. He took a step forward and a gust of wind howled between heaven and earth. Endless destructive wind appeared out of thin air and wreaked havoc in the world.</p><p>Each gust of wind was like a terrifying destructive divine weapon. It cut through the space, leaving a hideous mark in the space.</p><p>Feng wuchen was also a King body. He controlled the laws of the wind of destruction and was a lower-tier absolute Saint.</p><p>Although his cultivation level was the same as the Golden Crow Crown Prince, his battle-power was much stronger.</p><p>Long Chen and Huang Li’s eyes turned serious. The Saint energy in their bodies circulated crazily, and they used their full strength to unleash their laws. They were like two wild beasts that were lying dormant, ready to unleash a shocking attack at any moment.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>At this moment, Feng wuchen pressed down with a single hand, and a terrifying destructive wind swept toward Long Chen and desolate.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen and desolate li attacked at the same time. They punched continuously, causing the sky to shake. The air was completely compressed together, forming a terrifying force that shot towards the destructive wind.</p><p>Explosions continued to occur in the sky. Long Chen and desolate Li’s bodies trembled as they were forced back.</p><p>“You can block one of my attacks. Not bad. Continue!”</p><p>Feng wuchen’s body was wrapped in the wind as he continued to walk. With every step, the wind became more violent and swept through the sky. The clouds in the sky had long been swept away by the wind.</p><p>Two terrifying tornadoes flew towards desolate li and Long Chen..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
