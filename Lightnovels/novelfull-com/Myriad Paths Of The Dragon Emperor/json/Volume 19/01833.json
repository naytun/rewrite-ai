On the side, the heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa had a serious look in their eyes.</p><p>The first Prince, Ouyang wudao, was extremely talented and had a profound cultivation. He was domineering and decisive, and he had the support of the Daluo heaven sect. He was the most promising candidate for the Crown Prince position.</p><p>“Big brother, it’s not the Ouyang family’s style to surrender before the battle. If big brother wants to be the Crown Prince, then let us see if you have the strength to do so!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s voice came from the silver Army.</p><p>big brother, if you want to become the Crown Prince and take control of the shenyuan Empire, then show me your strength!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang also said.</p><p>“You’re so stubborn!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao’s voice was very cold. He was tall and sturdy, wearing a purple robe, and was filled with dignity.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji and Ouyang Wushuang thought that they could compete with the first Prince just because they had the support of the only divine temple and the purple flame villa. What a joke! I will make them regret this!</p><p>A cold-looking young man beside Ouyang wudao said. He was a heaven’s favorite of the Daluo heaven sect. He had a terrifying talent and was very famous in the ancient sun sacred land.</p><p>The three sides confronted each other, and no one made a move.</p><p>All three sides had an Army of 30000, and their cultivations were all at the LV1 martial Royal realm. Their strengths were almost the same, and no one had the confidence to fight the other two sides alone in a head-on battle.</p><p>This meeting was just a test.</p><p>After a while, the three forces retreated at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest retreated to the military camp.</p><p>In the camp, Ouyang Wushuang and a few of his confidants, Lu Ming, Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa gathered together to discuss a strategy.</p><p>I think that the current plan is to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight. We won’t move and defend the camp. When the first Prince and the sixth Prince fight and both sides are injured, we can clean up the mess and take the first round!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng, the leader of the purple flame villa, said.</p><p>“Waiting for the other two sides to fight each other? haha, what a joke. How can they be so stupid? I’m guessing they have the same idea as us. They want to wait for the other two sides to fight so that they can reap the benefits. If this continues, it will only be a stalemate!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xiao Mucheng’s face sank and he said,”Oh?” Then what do you think we should do?”</p><p>“Take the initiative and attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>haha, taking the initiative to attack? what a joke. Lu Ming, although you’re strong and I admire you, you’re still a little weak when it comes to leading troops into battle!</p><p>you just said that the other two parties are also waiting for us to fight each other. They want to reap the benefits from the battle. If we take the initiative to attack, no matter which party we attack, we will be helping the third party. You are contradicting yourself!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sneered.</p><p>The paragons of the purple flame villa also sneered.</p><p>I want to break the stalemate. If it continues, no one knows how long it will last. I want to end it quickly and win the first round. That’s the way to go!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Win the first round? How to get it? I’m afraid that well be the first to be eliminated if we follow your method!” Xiao Mucheng sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming casually glanced at Xiao Mucheng and then ignored him. He looked at Ouyang Wushuang and said,” ninth Prince, I suggest that we attack the first Prince’s Army first, but we can’t make it too obvious. We should send Scouts to gather information first, and then attack in the dark…</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The ninth Prince said.</p><p>This was the countermeasure that he had come up with to curry favor with Lu mingshang. Of course, he could not say it out now. If it were to spread, their plan would be ruined.</p><p>“Ninth Prince, you can’t do this! You’ll definitely lose!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng’s expression changed drastically as he shouted, hoping to stop Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>that’s right. You can’t do this. You’re seeking your own destruction!</p><p>“Ninth Prince, please reconsider!”</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa also chimed in.</p><p>“Don’t worry, everyone. I know what I’m doing. There’s no need to persuade me!” He said.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang waved his hand.</p><p>“Ninth Prince, if you lose in the first round, the rest will be difficult. Ninth Prince, you have to think this through!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng said with a sullen face.</p><p>“This Prince’s mind is set!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>Hmph, since that’s the case, we won’t say anything more. It seems like the crown prince’s position will fall into the hands of the first and sixth Prince!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sighed.</p><p>From the looks of it, they were definitely going to lose.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang did not say much and immediately sent out Scouts to find out about Ouyang wudao’s Army.</p><p>For the next few days, news about Ouyang wudao kept coming in.</p><p>For the past few days, Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji’s Army had been stationed in the military camp without any unusual movements.</p><p>In Ouyang wudao’s tent, they were also discussing the military situation.</p><p>“First Prince, the ninth Prince has been sending Scouts around the area to find out more about us. I’m afraid they’re going to take action soon!”</p><p>One of them reported to Ouyang wudao.</p><p>“I think the ninth Prince is trying to ambush us!”</p><p>A sovereign of the Daluo heaven sect said.</p><p>“Sneak attack us? Haha, then let’s beat him at his own game. Ninth brother, you’re still too impulsive, haha!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao burst out laughing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three sides were in a stalemate for seven days.</p><p>On the night of the seventh day, Ouyang Wushuang sent a trusted aide to lead an Army of 25000 to Ouyang wudao’s camp.</p><p>In the dead of the night, Ouyang Wushuang’s Army arrived not far from the first Prince’s camp. From afar, it seemed very peaceful. Some people were resting, while others were patrolling.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The commander was one of Ouyang Wushuang’s trusted men, called Luan Fei. With a wave of his hand, the Army charged towards the first Prince’s camp at full speed.</p><p>“Not good, enemy attack!”</p><p>&Nbsp; those patrolling noticed the Army and their expressions changed as they shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Luan Fei roared and charged forward with his Army. Those patrolling guards were killed and turned into rays of light, disappearing from this place.</p><p>In the array world, once you were killed, you would leave this place. Before the end of this competition, you could not enter this place a second time.</p><p>“Charge in!”</p><p>Luan Fei roared as he led his Army into the first Prince’s camp. Terrifying attacks converged together and exploded toward the tents.</p><p>If there was anyone in the tent, they would have been blown to pieces.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The tent exploded, but there was no one inside.</p><p>“Not good, we’ve been tricked. Retreat!”</p><p>Frenzied flight’s expression changed as he roared.</p><p>“It’s too late to find out now. Kill!”</p><p>The first Prince appeared in the sky and gave the order.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>From the ground, endless sword Qi burst out and slashed toward Ouyang Wushuang’s Army.</p><p>At the same time, countless attacks exploded down from the sky, blasting towards the Army.</p><p>Instantly, screams rang out as large swaths of soldiers were killed. In the blink of an eye, thousands of people had been killed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>From all directions, there were figures, and all kinds of terrifying attacks poured towards them. They were like living targets..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
