There was a beautiful lady there to receive Lu Ming.</p><p>“What kind of information do you need? For example, information about people, cultivation Arts, or martial skills, or even materials for sacred medicine?”</p><p>The young woman had a gentle smile on her face, which made people feel very comfortable.</p><p>“It’s a type of Saint herb!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If you want the sacred medicine, please go to room six. I’ll bring you there!”</p><p>The young lady smiled and led Lu Ming to a room at the side of the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed. Vientiane tower had a clear division of labor. The information was different according to the corresponding room.</p><p>This way, the efficiency would indeed be better.</p><p>Lu Ming saw an elegant middle-aged man as he walked into room No. 6.</p><p>“Sir, what kind of Saint herb do you want to know?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>“I want to know where 1 can find the Grand astral Lotus for sale or if I can find one.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the astral treasure Lotus is an extremely rare sacred medicine with special effects. There haven’t been many of them since ancient times!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man sighed.</p><p>“Even Vientiane tower doesn’t have any news about the Grand astral treasure Lotus?” Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>haha, 1 can only say that you’re very lucky. If you had come a few days earlier, you might have made a wasted trip. But yesterday, 1 just received news about the Grand astral treasure Lotus. Someone has seen it in a place!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>“What place?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>brother, don’t worry. A sacred herb like the Grand astral treasure Lotus is too rare. Vientiane tower paid a huge price to obtain this information. If you want to know this information, you naturally have to pay a price too!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man smiled.</p><p>“How many raw gemstones?” Lu Ming said. He knew that if he wanted to know more, he would need the rough stone.</p><p>information on a rare item like the Grand astral treasure Lotus is naturally precious. Five hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones for this piece of information!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man said.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips trembled slightly. A piece of news was sold for five hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones. It was really expensive.</p><p>Of course, Vientiane tower’s people were all over the place. The cost of training so many people was very high. It was normal for information to be sold at a high price.</p><p>“Alright, 1 want the information on the Grand astral treasure Lotus!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and placed five hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones in it. He then handed it to the middle-aged man.</p><p>After the elegant middle-aged man confirmed the number, he said,” some time ago, someone saw the Taiyi treasure Lotus in the Taiyi sword tomb. However, the Taiyi treasure Lotus is extremely spiritual and can escape on its own. Therefore, it’s up to your luck whether you can get it. Please!</p><p>After saying that, the middle-aged man waved his hand to send the guest off.</p><p>“The Taiyi sword tomb?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he left Vientiane tower.</p><p>Not long after, he returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>He then sent a message to Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others, saying that he would be leaving for a while.</p><p>He planned to head to the Taiyi sword tomb immediately to look for the Grand sui treasure Lotus and help Qiu Yue regain her memories.</p><p>For things like memories, the longer they were dragged on, the more likely it would be disadvantageous to Qiu Yue and the more difficult it would be to recover.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have to worry about the yuan mountain sacred Institute. Desolate force had broken through to the absolute Saint realm and his strength had increased greatly. Moreover, there was also Luo Tianyi. If they joined forces, they would be able to protect themselves.</p><p>After making his decision, Lu Ming did not waste any time and walked towards the teleportation array of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t directly teleport to the Taiyi sword tomb. Instead, he teleported to the public teleportation area near the Taiyi sword tomb.</p><p>In fact, every Emperor-level force would set up a teleportation array, but it was almost all one-way. It could only teleport people out and not people from the outside.</p><p>If someone from the outside could be directly teleported into a force, then that force would be very dangerous. If it was an enemy, then it would be even more dangerous.</p><p>Only forces with very good relationships would open two-way teleportation between each other, allowing free movement.</p><p>Therefore, in many areas, there would be a public transportation area.</p><p>For example, outside the ancient Moon Holy Land, outside the ancient sun Holy Land, and the eight satellite cities around the heavenly Emperor City were all public teleportation areas. If outsiders wanted to enter these places, they could only first teleport to the public teleportation area and then fly there.</p><p>Therefore, if one wanted to go to a certain place, they could only teleport to the nearest public teleportation zone and fly there.</p><p>After all, Yuan mountain was too big. It was unrealistic to fly all the way. Even an ordinary monarch level expert would need a long time to cross the entire Yuan mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the teleportation array and was teleported to the public teleportation zone closest to the Taiyi sword tomb. He then took out the space-breaking shuttle and flew toward the Taiyi sword tomb.</p><p>This space-breaking flying shuttle was obtained by Lu Ming after he killed an enemy. It was a space-breaking flying shuttle that was 20 times faster than the one that the valley master of Skycloud Valley had.</p><p>In the space-breaking flying shuttle, Lu Ming restored his original appearance and released Qiu Yue from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“The celestial Emperor’s sword, what’s so magical about it? let me see.”</p><p>Qiu Yue came out and looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Was this man really her young master?</p><p>His talent was also amazing, and he could barely be her young master! Qiu Yue’s mind was filled with strange thoughts.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. With a thought, the celestial Thearch sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword really did look like a stone sword. It was made from a strange stone, and there was nothing unusual about it at the moment. It really looked like an ordinary stone sword.</p><p>It didn’t have that shocking appearance when it was pulled out.</p><p>this really is the celestial Emperor’s sword. It looks very ordinary. Could the legends be wrong?”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at the stone sword curiously, then took it and looked at it carefully. Finally, she injected her Saint power into it, but the stone sword had no reaction at all.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and infused it with holy power. He even circulated the chaos law but there was no reaction.</p><p>there’s no reaction at all. It’s a useless sword!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Then, the two of them studied it again, but there was still no result.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to store it in the mountain and river diagram. He would study it in the future.</p><p>The distance to the Taiyi sword tomb was not short. Even with a</p><p>space-breaking flying shuttle that was 20 times faster, it would still take half a month.</p><p>The two of them started cultivating in the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>Half a month passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>They came to a wild mountain range, surrounded by vast mountains. In the mountains, the roars of beasts could be heard.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the space-breaking shuttle and the two of them stepped on the air. After more than a hundred thousand miles, they realized that the area was becoming more and more deathly silent and there were fewer and fewer living creatures.</p><p>In the end, they saw an incomparably huge cave. It was like a huge Devil’s well that led underground.</p><p>In the cave, there was a constant flow of death energy, which was why the cave was so quiet.</p><p>It was said that the Taiyi sword tomb was under this cave where the swords were buried..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
