Instantly, the Golden Crow crown prince’s expression changed as he retreated rapidly. His palm trembled slightly as a sharp pain came from it. His finger had almost been broken by Huang Li’s punch.</p><p>“Lu Ming is right. He’s indeed a sick bird!”</p><p>Desolate li grinned.</p><p>It caused the other desolate race youths to burst out in laughter.</p><p>“Find… Die!”</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince spat out these two words in anger, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>Just now, he had been too careless. Furthermore, he had not expected that desolate’s punch would contain such a terrifying amount of power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince let out a long howl and transformed into his true form. He turned into a huge three-legged golden Crow. His cultivation of the lower tier absolute Saint realm burst out. He flapped his wings and charged toward desolate li.</p><p>The terrifying great sun divine fire seemed to be able to incinerate everything as it poured towards the desolate power.</p><p>Huang Li wore a pair of gloves on his hands. He circulated his nomological laws as he punched out continuously. Every punch caused the sky to rumble and form a vacuum. The terrifying fist force smashed towards the Golden Crow Crown Prince, destroying the great sun divine fire.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s body had shrunk to the size of a normal person, but his speed was even more shocking. He was like a golden ray of light as he pounced towards Huang Li. His three golden Crow claws were extremely hard and seemed to be able to pierce through everything. At the same time, his wings were like blades as they slashed towards Huang Li.</p><p>Desolate power responded to all changes by remaining still. It stood in the air unmoving as it punched out with both fists, clashing fiercely with the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of blows. Desolate power was able to hold back the Golden Crow crown prince’s attacks.</p><p>“A superior-grade heavenly spiritual body!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s spiritual body was also a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body. With his cultivation at the absolute Saint realm, his combat power was indeed very strong.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that although he could temporarily resist the desolate power, he would definitely lose if the situation dragged on.</p><p>After all, there was a huge difference between a Supreme Saint and an absolute Saint.</p><p>“The law of extremity, it’s the king body!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites who were attracted here were shocked.</p><p>Even in the yuan mountain sacred Academy where geniuses were as common as clouds, there weren’t many King physiques. Every king physique that appeared would attract a lot of attention.</p><p>Once the king physique matured, it would definitely be very terrifying.</p><p>The intense battle between desolate power and the Golden Crow Crown Prince continued. However, just as Lu Ming had expected, the Golden Crow crown prince’s attacks became more and more violent. Desolate power was gradually losing and was being suppressed.</p><p>“I’ll go help him!”</p><p>A figure stepped out from behind Lu Ming. It was Qiu Yue.</p><p>Two scimitars flew out of Qiu Yue’s body. One was extremely cold, and the other was scorching hot.</p><p>The two scimitars spun and turned into a destructive force that shot toward the Golden Crow first Prince.</p><p>The terrifying power shocked the Golden Crow Crown Prince. He immediately counterattacked with his full power. The power of the divine Sun Fire and Qiu Yue collided.</p><p>However, the Golden Crow Crown Prince still underestimated Qiu Yue. The two curved blades broke through the godly Sun Fire and slashed towards the Golden Crow Crown Prince. The Golden Crow Crown Prince quickly retreated in shock, but he was still swept by the blades, and golden feathers fell all over the sky.</p><p>“Bah, bird feathers all over the sky, kill!”</p><p>die! Huang Li shouted as he charged at the Golden Crow Crown Prince, his fists punching out.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, she used her desolate power and the laws of yin and yang to attack the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince used all his power to fight the two, but he was actually forced into a disadvantage.</p><p>another King physique. Why are there so many King physiques?”</p><p>In the distance, many people were shocked.</p><p>Desolate power and Qiu Yue were both new, and they were together with Feng Ling and Long Chen. This meant that Feng Ling and Long Chen had four King bodies.</p><p>Four King bodies. Their cultivation was still a little weak, but if they all became absolute Saints, what kind of power would they have?</p><p>“Despicable, two against one!”</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow roared.</p><p>an ultimate Saint fighting a great saint? you still have the face to say that? How about this? it’s only fair to fight on the same level!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the Golden Crow second Prince and the others as he spoke in disdain.</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow and the others were tongue-tied for a moment.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, only the body of a King could compete with someone of the same level. Lu Ming had so many body of a King. What did they have to fight against someone of the same level? their advantage was their cultivation and realm.</p><p>How could he give up his strong points and take his weak points?</p><p>“Lady Qiuyue, you’re a member of the only divine temple. Are you going to interfere in our Affairs?”</p><p>The Golden crow’s second Prince turned his attention to Qiu Yue, hoping that she would back out of this matter.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue couldn’t be bothered with the second golden Crow Prince and attacked even more fiercely.</p><p>Desolate power and Qiu Yue, one attacking from close range and the other from afar, worked together to create a terrifying battle power. The Golden Crow Crown Prince roared in anger, but he could do nothing.</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince had used all his strength, but he was at most on par with Qiu Yue and desolate li. Sometimes, he was even at a disadvantage.</p><p>Although the Golden Crow crown prince’s cultivation was strong and had reached the initial absolute Saint realm, he had just broken through not long ago. Furthermore, the laws he controlled weren’t King path laws. Qiu Yue and desolate li were both great saints in the great circle, not far from the absolute Saint realm. The two of them working together were no weaker than the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>The two sides exchanged dozens of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>that’s amazing. Two King physiques. Moreover, they are both following Lu Ming!</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen were fine since they had seen Qiu Yue before. However, the other geniuses of the Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>There were actually two King physique experts who came with Lu Ming. Moreover, their cultivation had reached the great saint perfection, which was even stronger than Feng Ling and Long Chen. What about the combat strength of the rest?</p><p>Many people could not help but cast their gazes towards the remaining desolate race members.</p><p>However, Huang Tian and the others were looking at the battlefield, and they were all eager to fight.</p><p>In the past, when they were in the wild sacred region, they had only faced a limited number of geniuses. When had they ever seen so many geniuses? they felt like their blood was boiling, and their battle intent was burning. They wanted to fight just like desolate power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, fight me if you’re so capable. What’s the point of hiding?”</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince let out a long cry as he continuously shot out great solar divine fire, forcing Qiu Yue and desolate power back.</p><p>“You want to fight with me? fine, I’ll fight with you. Let’s go to the life-and-death battle stage. Do you dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, his voice exuding a terrifying murderous intent.</p><p>“A life-and-death battle!”</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s heart skipped a beat and he hesitated.</p><p>He had heard of Lu Ming’s combat strength. However, no matter how strong Lu Ming was, he was no match for him.</p><p>However, those who stepped into the life-and-death battle stage would have a life-and-death battle.</p><p>It was allowed to kill one’s opponent in the life-and-death arena. The sacred Institute didn’t forbid it.</p><p>This was extremely dangerous. Since the start of the sacred Institute, not many people had stepped onto the life-and-death battle stage.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You wanted to challenge me to a battle earlier, but now you don’t dare to? He’s so arrogant, but he’s just a coward!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered coldly, his mockery growing stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t know this, do you? these people only know how to bully the weak and fear the strong. They use their power to bully others and take advantage of others ‘might. If they meet someone stronger or more ruthless, they’ll immediately become tortoises!”</p><p>Long Chen sneered, causing the others to burst into laughter..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
