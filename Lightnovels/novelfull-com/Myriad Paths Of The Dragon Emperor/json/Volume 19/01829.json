After a while, he said,” “A year ago, something big did happen in the ancient yang Holy Land. I wonder if it has anything to do with miss Qiu Yue?”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>a year ago, miss Qiuyue’s master, the only powerful existence in the divine temple, suddenly went crazy and killed his way to the Daluo heaven sect. In the end, for some unknown reason, master Qiuyue retreated again!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>Master Qiuyue suddenly went to the Daluo heaven sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in deep thought.</p><p>miss Qiuyue’s master is definitely a true Emperor, and even among the true emperors, he’s an extremely powerful existence. The Daluo heaven sect is the most powerful existence in the ancient yang Holy Land, and it’s even said that there’s a great emperor in charge. If there’s nothing important, why would miss Qiuyue’s master come to the Daluo heaven sect? ”</p><p>this matter caused a great shock in the ancient sun Holy Land at that time. Later on, there were many different opinions. People were guessing what exactly happened to make a powerful true Emperor so angry that he went to the Daluo heaven sect. But in the end, he left without a solution. But until now, there has been no unified explanation!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>Daluo heaven sect, could it be that what happened to Qiuyue is related to the Daluo heaven sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Then, he chatted with Ouyang Wushuang for a while more but could not come to a conclusion. In the end, he bade farewell and left.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>Seven days later, Ouyang Wushuang gathered everyone again.</p><p>everyone, the content of this assessment is out. It will be divided into three stages. The first stage will be the assessment of leading an Army in battle!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Leading an Army into battle?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>that’s right. If you want to become the Crown Prince of a country, you need to be outstanding in all aspects, such as martial Dao talent, wisdom, connections, etc., Before you can control a country!</p><p>the first round will be held in a world of formations. I, Ouyang Wuji, and Ouyang wudao will each lead an Army of 30000 in battle. We will be ranked according to our battle results!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained.</p><p>each side has 30000 troops. Are the cultivation levels of these 30000 troops similar for all three sides?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>If one side’s 30000 strong Army was strong while the other side’s was weak, then no matter how strong one’s commanding ability was, it was useless.</p><p>don’t worry about that. Everyone who enters the world of formations will only use their spiritual consciousness. Anyone who enters will have their cultivation suppressed to Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm. Even if they are killed inside, they will only be eliminated and not killed!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>Everyone who entered would have their cultivation suppressed to the first level Martial Emperor realm. In other words, the 30000 soldiers were all at the first level Martial Emperor realm. They would also be at the first level Martial Emperor realm when they entered.</p><p>In an Army of tens of thousands of soldiers, an individual’s battle prowess could hardly affect the overall situation. Only the ability to command troops and the cooperation of battle formations would be fully displayed.</p><p>the first test will take the longest time. There will be two months of training at the start. In these two months, I will lead thirty thousand troops and train their battle formations. Two months later, the three sides will begin to fight against each other. Starting from today, I will take you to see!</p><p>After Ouyang Wushuang finished speaking, he walked out.</p><p>Everyone followed him, and soon, they arrived at a vast and spacious area.</p><p>Mysterious runes glowed in all directions, forming a mysterious array.</p><p>On the ground, there were many figures sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed, as if they were in a meditative state.</p><p>there are a total of 30000 people here, and they are currently in the world of formations. There are experts from the Empire guarding this place, so you can enter the world of formations without worry. No one will disturb you. Let’s go in as well!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said. He landed on the ground first and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest landed on the ground, sat cross-legged, and closed their eyes. Instantly, inscriptions climbed up their bodies and enveloped them.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if his spirit had left his body and entered a void. Soon, he opened his eyes and found himself on a platform. Ouyang Wushuang, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others had also appeared.</p><p>as expected, he’s only at the LV 1 Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed his body. Indeed, he was only left with the cultivation of a first level Martial Emperor. Everyone else was the same. Their cultivation was at the first level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>it’s amazing. It’s similar to the floating platform in the Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The sky-high floating platform in Dragon God Valley was also a place where one’s spirit could enter to cultivate. This array world was also where one’s spirit could enter and then condense a body from the array world.</p><p>In front of the platform, there was a huge military camp. He could see many people in the military camp.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang took the lead and flew over, followed by the rest.</p><p>“The ninth Prince is here!”</p><p>Someone in the military camp shouted.</p><p>“Sound the Army drums, the Army will gather!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang passed down the order.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>His deep voice reverberated throughout the entire camp.</p><p>With a flash of their figures, the Army gathered on the empty drill ground.</p><p>Not long after, the 30 thousand strong Army had gathered.</p><p>Each of them wore black armor and were all Lv 1 martial Royal realm martial artists. They stood together with an imposing aura.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang stood at a high place and looked around.</p><p>“This time, the sixth Prince, Ouyang Wuji, and the first Prince, Ouyang wudao, are fighting for the position of Crown Prince. If you all help me become the Crown Prince, you will all be heroes. When I inherit the throne in the future, I will definitely not forget you.”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“I’ll do my best to help the ninth Prince become the Crown Prince!”</p><p>The 30,000 strong Army roared.</p><p>If they could help the ninth Prince become the Crown Prince, Ouyang Wushuang would take control of the divine Yuan Empire in the future. Their lives would be much better, and they would have more opportunities. If they could seize the opportunity, they might be able to rise to the top.</p><p>alright, we’ll train together for the next two months. I have a formation here, the sky Tiger roaring formation. You’ll have to train this formation with all your might for the next two months!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The 30,000-strong Army received the order, and their voices shook the heavens.</p><p>In a battle between great armies, only by coordinating with a great formation could they display their powerful combat strength.</p><p>Some formations could even unleash ten times, or even a hundred times the combat power. An Army that did not know how to use battle formations would be easily defeated by an Army that knew how to use battle formations.</p><p>everyone, please take a good rest during the first round of assessment. We will need your help for the second and third round!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The first round was the battle of commanding troops. Lu Ming and the others were only at the LV 1 martial Royal realm after entering this place, so they were not of much use.</p><p>Their role was mainly in the second and third round.</p><p>ninth Prince, please go ahead. We’ll just look around!</p><p>A genius from the purple flame villa said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded and went to teach the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation to the thirty thousand strong Army..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
