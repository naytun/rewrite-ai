A Phoenix let out a long cry and soared into the sky.</p><p>Huang Ling’s cultivation was similar to Long Chen’s. She had also reached the peak of Supreme Saint.</p><p>In Phoenix Palace, the other paragons of divine elephant sect also released their auras and stared at mo lang and the others with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>Mo lang and the others ‘expressions changed again and again, and they subconsciously retreated.</p><p>you’re so stubborn. Don’t think that you can compete with the wind race’s heaven’s favorite with your cultivation. You’re delusional. Just you wait. Let’s go!</p><p>The second Prince of the Golden Crow said coldly and left with mo lang and the others.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen looked at each other and saw the worry in each other’s eyes.</p><p>After that, they returned to the courtyard.</p><p>“Feng Ling, Long Chen, what happened? What’s the background of the wind race?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the Wind Clan is an ancient clan. The place where they live in seclusion is actually the ancient Moon Holy Land. Some time ago, the Wind Clan appeared, and their geniuses came out to join the yuan mountain Saint Academy!</p><p>the paragons of the wind race are extremely overbearing. They want to establish a force in the yuan mountain sacred Academy and make all the other paragons of the ancient Moon Holy Land join them. For example, the paragons of the black wolf, Purple Extreme sect, and golden Crow race have all joined the wind race’s camp. We are the only ones not joining the ancient Moon Holy Land!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>they are too tyrannical. It was originally our freedom to join or not. However, the wind race announced that if we don’t join, we won’t be able to stay in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Mu Qingxue’s expression was very ugly.</p><p>“Wind race? Gu Yue Holy Land actually has an ancient race living in seclusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>“How’s the strength of the wind race’s heaven’s favorite?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the strongest heaven’s favorite of the wind race is called Wu fengchen. He has a King body and a superior-grade heaven spiritual body. He can control the law of the destructive wind and has long broken through to the absolute Saint realm. He is one of the strongest heaven’s favorites in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>an absolute Saint King body! No wonder he’s so arrogant!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>His King body had reached the absolute Saint realm, so his combat strength was definitely terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry was heard in the distant sky. A Golden ray of light flew toward the place where Lu Ming and the others were staying at a terrifying speed.</p><p>It was a three-legged golden Crow. When it spread its wings, it was at least 100 meters long. Its entire body was bathed in the divine fire of the great sun, like a sun.</p><p>“It’s the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow!”</p><p>he’s probably going to deal with Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others!</p><p>the wind race wants to unify the geniuses of ancient Moon Holy Land. They obviously have their eyes on Feng Ling and Long Chen’s talents. Although their talents are high, their cultivation is still low. I’m afraid they won’t be able to fight against them!</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites in the nearby mountains sensed it and flew up to the sky to watch.</p><p>The three-legged golden Crow was extremely fast. In just a few breaths, he had reached where Lu Ming and the others were staying. He flapped his wings and a large amount of great divine Sun Fire poured down on them.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest were chatting. Suddenly, everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>“Great sun divine fire, damn it!”</p><p>die! Huang Ling and Long Chen shouted at the same time. They shot up into the sky and attacked, extinguishing the divine Sun Fire.</p><p>Lu Ming, desolate power, and the rest were moved. They were not in a hurry to take action.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>A screech that resounded through the firmament was heard. A young man in a golden robe appeared in the sky. His eyes were like lightning, and he was extremely domineering. A pair of golden Crow wings slowly flapped behind him, and a terrifying aura enveloped the entire mountain.</p><p>“The Saint realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This three-legged golden Crow actually had the cultivation of an absolute Saint.</p><p>“The Golden Crow Crown Prince!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others muttered with a solemn look in their eyes.</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince was extremely famous in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Before the Feng clan appeared, he was one of the strongest geniuses in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Especially after joining the yuan mountain Saint Academy, he used the resources of the yuan mountain Saint Academy to break through to the absolute Saint realm. His reputation was even more well-known.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More than a dozen figures appeared behind the Golden Crow Crown Prince. It was mo lang and the others.</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, I advise you to surrender and join us. Don’t put up any unnecessary resistance. You should know that resistance is futile!</p><p>Mo lang shouted coldly with an arrogant expression.</p><p>“If you want to be the dogs of the wind race, go ahead. We’re not interested in that!”</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s wings flapped, and flames spread out, making him look even more majestic. He glanced coldly at Long Chen and Feng Ling and said,” in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, although 1 can’t kill you, 1 can still injure you severely. If you don’t agree, 1 will beat you up every time I see you. I will make it so that you won’t be able to stay in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>a sick bird. What big words. Is the yuan mountain sacred Academy opened by you?”</p><p>A mocking voice came from a side courtyard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s face was dark as he looked at the courtyard.</p><p>He actually dared to call him a sick bird, he was looking for death!</p><p>Then, more than a dozen figures stepped into the air. Lu Ming was walking in front, followed by Huang Li, Qiu Yue, and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mo lang, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, and the others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>“So, you are Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s eyes grew even colder.</p><p>“I’m sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>good, very good. In the past, if 1 hadn’t always been in heaven Emperor City, how could you have acted so atrociously in ancient Moon Holy Land? I thought you wouldn’t dare to come to ancient Moon Holy Land. Since you’re here, I’ll teach you a good lesson today and take revenge for ninth brother and the others!</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in the eyes of the Golden Crow Crown Prince. If it were not for the fact that killing was forbidden in the sacred Institute, he would have killed Lu Ming.</p><p>However, even if he couldn’t kill Lu Ming, he could still humiliate him and step on him in front of everyone so that he wouldn’t be able to lift his head in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince continued to step forward, and the divine Sunfire on his body became even hotter. The flames filled the sky and his aura was wild as he pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others all released their auras, ready to fight.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to meet such a character as soon as I came out. Leave this bird to me!”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, desolate li grinned. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight. He stepped forward and walked toward the Golden Crow Crown Prince.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still. Since the desolate power wanted to make a move, he would just let it move.</p><p>you? you’re just a great saint. Get down!</p><p>The Golden Crow Crown Prince had a haughty expression on his face as he casually glanced at desolate li. With a palm strike, flames gathered and formed a giant flaming palm that slammed down on desolate li.</p><p>“Lie down, your sister! Sick bird, you’re the one who’s lying down!”</p><p>die! desolate li roared as his muscles bulged. He punched out and destroyed the flaming palm. Without stopping, he charged towards the Golden Crow Crown Prince and punched out.</p><p>The Golden Crow crown prince’s expression changed. He bent his fingers like a claw and clawed at desolate li..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
