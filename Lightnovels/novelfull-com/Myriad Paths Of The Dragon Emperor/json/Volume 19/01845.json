You’re trying to get close to Junior Sister Qiuyue, but let me tell you, she’s already taken, so don’t bother her anymore!”</p><p>...</p><p>Yu Shu berated.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had already been patient and tried to talk to the other party nicely, but the other party was deliberately making things difficult for him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly took a step forward. His overwhelming aura pressed toward Yu Shu.</p><p>Yu Shu’s expression changed drastically, and she shouted,”what are you trying to do?!” How dare you try to break into my only sacred Hall? men, kill this person!”</p><p>During the shenyuan Empire’s assessment, he had suffered at Lu Ming’s hands time and time again. He had long harbored hatred in his heart. Now that there was an opportunity, he naturally had to seize it and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>As Yu Shu’s voice rang out, a few powerful auras burst out from the only sacred Hall. A few figures flew through the air and flew over.</p><p>Each figure was surrounded by a River of laws. They were all Emperor-to-be figures.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang in everyone’s ears. It was filled with supreme authority.</p><p>Yu Shu, the young men, and the Emperor-to-be all changed their expressions. They stopped and bowed to the depths of the sacred Hall, saying,” “Ice screen Grand Elder!”</p><p>“Bring Lu Ming in to see me!”</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>Yu Shu’s expression changed slightly. It seemed that the Grand Elder of the ice curtain had found out about the situation.</p><p>“Brat, you’ve gone far today!”</p><p>Yu Shu sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming coldly and then left.</p><p>young master Lu Ming, please follow me. The Grand Supreme elder of the ice curtain wants to see you!</p><p>One of the guards said.</p><p>“Ouyang, you can go back first. There’s no need to wait for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming told Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>“No rush, I can wait here!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang smiled faintly. He was afraid that something would happen to Lu Ming after he entered. With him, the Crown Prince of the shenyuan Empire, around, the other party would have some reservations.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say much. He and the gatekeeper walked toward the depths of the only holy temple.</p><p>The only sacred Hall was surrounded by many halls, and they couldn’t see the end of it. They bypassed many halls and came to a small hall.</p><p>this is the residence of the ice curtain sect’s Grand Supreme elder. You may enter!</p><p>After the guard finished speaking, he turned and left.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the door open and entered. Behind the door was a small courtyard. A figure stood there with his hands behind his back and his back facing Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming closed the door and came behind the figure. He cupped his fists and said,” “Junior Lu Ming greets senior ice screen!”</p><p>MMH!</p><p>The figure nodded and turned around. It was a beautiful middle-aged woman.</p><p>I heard that you said that you were Qiu Yue’s young master during the shenyuan Empire’s examination. Is that true?”</p><p>The middle-aged lady spoke. At the same time, a terrifying aura filled the air and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if he was being stared at by an extremely terrifying existence. It was as if he would be turned into ashes with just a thought from the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s back was drenched in cold sweat. This was his body’s subconscious reaction.</p><p>This beautiful middle-aged woman was definitely an extremely terrifying person. Her cultivation was unfathomable. Lu Ming felt that everything about him had been seen through. If he lied, he had no doubt that the other party would kill him immediately.</p><p>“Senior, everything junior has said is true. Junior comes from the divine wilderness continent’s blazing sun Empire’s Lu family. Back then, when senior took Qiu Yue away from the divine wilderness continent, didn’t you leave behind a sentence? In the divine wilderness, the only one in the world!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied in a humble manner.</p><p>A hint of surprise flashed through Bing MU’s eyes, but his gaze became even colder.”lt seems like you’re right. So, you’re here to take Qiu Yue away and make her your maid again?”</p><p>“Senior, you’ve misunderstood. I’ve never treated Qiu Yue as a servant. I’ve grown up with Qiu Yue and I’ve always treated Qiu Yue as my family!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, the aura on ice screen’s body was retracted, and a hint of warmth appeared on her face.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a long sigh of relief. The other party was too terrifying. That wisp of steam engine had put Lu Ming under terrifying pressure.</p><p>The ice curtain sized Lu Ming up curiously. 1 really never expected that you would be able to walk out of the divine wilderness and achieve such an achievement!</p><p>She already knew that Lu Ming was taking the examination in the shenyuan Empire. How could she not know that it was related to her disciple, Qiu Yue?</p><p>Regarding this, she was really surprised. Lu Ming could actually walk out of the divine wilderness and come to the yuan continent. Furthermore, he had such shocking achievements, suppressing many of the geniuses of the ancient yang Holy Land. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Back then, when she took Qiu Yue away, she left behind the eight words ‘in the divine wilderness, the only one in the world’. She had just said it casually, but she did not expect that someone would really find her.</p><p>“Senior is too kind, junior was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>luck? hehe, I’ve never heard of anyone who can reach this stage by relying on luck. Alright, did you come to me this time to ask about Qiu Yue? ”</p><p>Ice screen said.</p><p>“That’s right, senior. Why did Qiu Yue completely forget about me? and when I mentioned what happened back then, she also completely forgot about it? What happened to Qiu Yue?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a series of questions.</p><p>“Qiu Yue’s memory was taken away!”</p><p>Ice curtain sighed.</p><p>“What? His memories were taken away?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. A cold light flashed in his eyes. Who was it? However, he could even take away memories. What kind of method was this?</p><p>that’s right. He’s Luo cangqiong, the number one genius of the Daluo heaven sect. He has a King’s body and controls the law of deprivation, one of the laws of the king path. He can deprive everything, even his memories!</p><p>Ice screen said.</p><p>“Why? Why would they do that?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned colder.</p><p>“Because Luo cangqiong likes Qiu Yue and has been pursuing her. But Qiu Yue already has someone in her heart, and that person is you. She always believes that you will come to her, so why would she care about Luo cangqiong’s pursuit?”</p><p>so, in a fit of anger, Luo cangqiong took away all of Qiu Yue’s memories from before. All of her memories regarding the divine wilderness continent were taken away, leaving only her memories of the yuan continent. He wanted Qiu Yue to forget you and accept him!</p><p>The ice curtain revealed the truth.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and a cold killing intent emanated from him. He did not expect that things would turn out like this.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s memory was actually taken away by someone else, and the reason was that Qiu Yue already had someone in her heart.</p><p>It was simply laughable and simply deserving of death!</p><p>“Senior, as Qiu Yue’s master, aren’t you going to take revenge for her?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked straight at the ice screen, a faint trace of anger in his eyes.</p><p>of course 1 want to take revenge for Qiu Yue. 1 once went to the Daluo heaven sect in anger, but I quit in the end. Do you know why? ”</p><p>that’s because Luo cangqiong’s grandfather was a great sovereign. It was only a legend before, but I saw it with my own eyes. Luo cangqiong relied on his grandfather’s status as a great sovereign to act lawlessly, but no one dared to touch him!</p><p>The ice curtain spoke, her voice filled with helplessness..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
