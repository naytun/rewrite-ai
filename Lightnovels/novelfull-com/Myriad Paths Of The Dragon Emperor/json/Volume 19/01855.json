He and Qiu Yue flew forward at top speed.</p><p>...</p><p>At this distance, even if ha Zheng was about to attack, they could get bubbles to open a spacetime tunnel and escape.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had let go of hammerty, ha Zheng burst out with a terrifying speed and appeared beside hammerty. He grabbed hammerty and then retreated rapidly, rushing toward the vortex.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally saw this scene.</p><p>“No, ha Zheng seems to be very afraid and wants to leave. Is there danger here?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed at the thought of this.</p><p>“let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pulled Qiu Yue’s hand, about to rush toward the vortex.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a battle axe appeared in the sky. It was extremely huge, and it slashed down at ha Zheng.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Ha Zheng roared, and a River of laws appeared. He punched out and sent the battle-ax flying.</p><p>However, at the same time, a huge hand as large as a mountain surrounded by a River of laws grabbed at ha Zheng.</p><p>This was an Emperor-to-be, and an Emperor-to-be had made a move.</p><p>Ha Zheng waved his hand, and Saint weapons flew out to block the hand while he charged toward the vortex.</p><p>As he was already prepared, he was very close to the vortex. With a few flashes, he rushed near the vortex and rushed in, disappearing.</p><p>At the same time that ha Zheng was attacked, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were attacked as well. A huge Mace was swung at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue with a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Absolute Saint in the great circle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. The attack of this Mace was at least equivalent to the attack power of a perfected absolute Saint. It was not something that they could fight against at the moment.</p><p>Bubbles waved her small hands and the space-time law enveloped Lu Ming and the rest. Their figures flickered rapidly and they dodged the attack.</p><p>At the same time, the other forces of the barren city were also attacked. The attackers were all very powerful and shocking.</p><p>“Not good, we’ve been tricked!”</p><p>“Damn it, I’ve fallen for ha Zheng’s vicious plan. Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The people of the six major forces roared loudly, wanting to retreat toward the vortex.</p><p>However, a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>These figures were extremely burly and were at least two meters tall. They were all wearing animal skins, revealing their muscular arms. Some carried battle axes on their backs, while others carried maces, just like the people of the ancient tribes.</p><p>However, each of them exuded an extremely terrifying aura. They were like giant beasts from the ancient times and were extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed that most of them were absolute Saints. A few of them were surrounded by the river of laws. They were Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>He finally knew why ha Zheng had come in alone without bringing any experts from the HA family. It was obvious that ha Zheng had known about the situation here, so he immediately rushed toward the vortex after rescuing hamenti.</p><p>It was too late for Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest to rush to the vortex.</p><p>“Who are you people? We have no ill intentions!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s panicked voice rang out.</p><p>These ancient barbarian-like people were too strong. They were no match for them at all.</p><p>“Take them down!”</p><p>A deep voice rang out. Those tall figures made their move, and terrifying attacks poured towards them.</p><p>Especially those emperors-to-be, the river of laws condensed into a huge hand. With a grab, a large number of people were captured without any resistance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge hand covered the sky and cast a huge shadow as it grabbed at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>This was the attack of an Emperor-to-be. Just now, Lu Ming and the others had displayed an amazing movement technique and attracted an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Leave it to me, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles waved her hands and a space-time Tunnel was formed, leading directly to the vortex. Lu Ming and the rest rushed into the space-time Tunnel and avoided the attack of the large hand.</p><p>Just as they were about to rush into the space-time Tunnel, a tall and burly figure suddenly appeared in front of the vortex. With a grab, the space-time Tunnel collapsed and Lu Ming and the others were caught by the huge hand.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a surge of powerful energy surge towards him, sealing his cultivation.</p><p>“A Martial Emperor powerhouse! I’m not going to die Here, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely indignant. Immediately, his body went numb and his vision turned black. He fainted.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how long had passed before he woke up.</p><p>Where was this place?</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that he was in a secret room. The walls of the secret room were made of a black metal and were as smooth as a mirror.</p><p>Qiu Yue and bubbles were lying not far away from him.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his Saint energy and surged it into Qiu Yue and bubbles ‘bodies. After a while, Qiu Yue and bubbles woke up one after another.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, where is this place? chirpy!</p><p>Pao Pao blinked her large eyes as she sized up her surroundings.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He was thinking rapidly. Who were those people who looked like barbarians? Was this really the wild sacred region?</p><p>“I’ll bring you guys out!”</p><p>Said bubbles. She then executed her spacetime laws, causing ripples to appear in the void. She wanted to break through space and leave this place, but the surrounding walls suddenly glowed, causing bubbles to almost crash into them.</p><p>The bubble could travel through space, but it could not break through the walls on all sides.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and cast the prison suppressing heavenly art, throwing a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist hit the wall, making a violent boom, but the wall did not move at all.</p><p>“It’s so hard?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>With his current combat strength, a full-force punch could probably smash a great saint weapon into pieces. However, this wall was completely undamaged. “The Laws of Chaos! Space-time law!”</p><p>At this moment, a cry of surprise could be heard. It was an extremely shocked voice.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice. In the corner of the secret room, there was an extremely burly man. He was dressed in similar clothes to those who had brought them in.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen this person earlier but at that time, his attention was on Qiu Yue and bubbles and he did not pay attention to them.</p><p>The burly man sized up Lu Ming and bubbles, still looking surprised. After a while, he said,” guys, don’t waste your energy. The walls here are made of wild black Gold. They can isolate the Saint power and are extremely strong. Unless you have the cultivation of a martial Supreme, you can’t break them!</p><p>“Wild black Gold?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had never heard of such a metal. It actually required a martial Supreme to break it. No wonder it did not move at all when he punched it just now.</p><p>“Senior, where is this place? Why did those people want to capture us?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course it’s the ancient Savage barren realm. You’ve come here on your own, so don’t tell me you don’t know what this place is? As for the people who captured you, they are naturally the desolate race from the savage barren ancient region!”</p><p>The burly man explained.</p><p>“Desolate race? You are from the desolate race?”</p><p>Qiu Yue exclaimed in surprise..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
