The river of laws was almost pierced through, and blood spurted out of their mouths.</p><p>However, to their despair, the giant sword slashed down again, and they could only try their best to block it.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue. The mountain and river diagram flew out and kept Qiu Yue in it. Lu Ming’s glabella glowed again and he took out the Dayan elixir furnace. Lu Ming rushed into the furnace and controlled it to fly upwards.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace was the most important treasure of the Dayan elixir Palace. No one knew what level it was, but it was definitely above the Tai Chi formation disk.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sword radiance continued to slash at the Dayan elixir furnace, causing it to tremble. However, it was still slowly moving upwards.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan. He would let the two Emperor-to-be, the purple-robed elder and the woman in Palace attire, hold off the sword fiend while he rushed out with the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>If he was with the purple-robed elder and the others, they would not be able to escape from the sword fiend’s full-force attack.</p><p>Jian Sha’s eyes also changed slightly.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to have so many treasures on him. Each one was stronger than the last. If this went on, he would not have time to deal with Lu Ming. Lu Ming might really be able to get out of here.</p><p>don’t even think about it. All of you will stay here today. These treasures are all mine!</p><p>The sword fiend growled and his body was filled with a bloody light.</p><p>The blood light was the blood light he had just absorbed. It flowed out of his body like water, looking extremely strange.</p><p>Then, the blood light flowed to the giant sword in his hand and burned like a flame. The giant sword in his hand seemed to have turned into a terrifying sword of slaughter.</p><p>“Return to your position!”</p><p>The huge sword light that had attacked the purple-robed elder and the others also flew into the huge sword and fused together, making the aura of the huge sword in the sword fiend’s hand even more terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword fiend stepped in the air and the giant sword in his hand slashed down at the purple-robed elder and the woman in the palace dress.</p><p>The terrifying sword power covered the sky and earth. It was so terrifying that even the space trembled as if it had the power to split the sky and earth.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder and the woman’s expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>The power of this sword had exceeded the scope of an Emperor-to-be and was infinitely close to the attack of a Martial Emperor.</p><p>They were going to die from this attack!</p><p>“No, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>The purple-robed old man roared in his heart, and his eyes emitted a ferocious look. He suddenly struck out and hit the woman in the palace dress with his palm, sending her flying into the sky towards the sword fiend.</p><p>“You… Despicable!”</p><p>The woman in the court dress roared, her eyes filled with endless anger and fear.</p><p>But at this time, in order to save her life, she could only use all her strength to resist.</p><p>She had used all of her techniques, even her Saint weapons, but all of them were in vain against the sword fiend.</p><p>The giant sword slashed down, and all of the woman’s defenses, as well as her own body, were turned into ashes.</p><p>“This kid…”</p><p>After the purple-robed elder sent the woman flying with one palm, he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming kept taking out his monarch weapon. If he could get his hands on Lu Ming’s monarch weapon, his chances of escaping would be greatly increased.</p><p>However, Jian Sha would not let him do as he wished.</p><p>“Hehe, you want to leave? die!”</p><p>After the sword fiend killed the woman, his body flashed and he appeared above the purple-robed elder.</p><p>The purple-robed elder’s face was as white as snow.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>He roared, but as the sword light slashed down, he followed in the footsteps of the woman in Palace Clothing and turned into ashes.</p><p>He pushed the woman towards the sword fiend, but he himself only lived for a few more breaths.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>In the Dayan elixir furnace, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The sword fiend had been sending out some sword lights to stop him. At this moment, he had not charged too far.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t expect that the purple-robed elder and the woman in Palace attire, two Emperor-to-be experts, would be killed so quickly.</p><p>Swordfiend had clearly used a method to temporarily increase his combat power, allowing his own combat power to be infinitely close to that of an Emperor-level expert.</p><p>“Kid, it’s your turn now!”</p><p>The sword fiend sneered. He took a step forward and appeared above the Dayan elixir furnace. His huge sword slashed down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge sword hit the Dayan elixir furnace, causing it to shake violently. Like a cannonball, it fell into the abyss and hit the ground heavily.</p><p>The entire abyss started to shake violently. A huge pit that was 100 meters deep was created on the ground.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace was embedded in the deep pit.</p><p>In the Dayan elixir furnace, Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood and his face was pale.</p><p>Although he had the protection of the Dayan elixir furnace and the other party could not break it, Lu Ming’s cultivation was limited after all. He could not unleash the power of the Dayan elixir furnace at all.</p><p>Moreover, his cultivation was far inferior to his opponent’s. His opponent’s strength had injured Lu Ming just by shaking the pili furnace.</p><p>this treasure is really amazing. Haha, not only am I going to step into the Emperor-tier today, but I’ll also be able to obtain a few rare treasures. The heavens are really helping me!</p><p>The sword fiend laughed and appeared above the Dayan elixir furnace, slashing at it again.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace shook violently, and the terrifying power caused the surrounding ground to explode. The 100-meter-deep pit exploded again and became even larger.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace trembled and produced a terrifying force that bombarded Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood and his injuries worsened.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly, trying to find a way to escape. However, in such an environment, he could not escape at all.</p><p>The difference in strength between him and his opponent was too great. Even the Dayan elixir furnace couldn’t protect him. If this went on, he would be shaken to death sooner or later. He might even exhaust his Saint power and lose control of the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>“Let’s see how long you can hide. Slash, slash, slash!”</p><p>The sword fiend shouted and the huge sword in his hand, which was condensed from countless sword sources, kept slashing at the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>The entire abyss was shaking.</p><p>Spider web-like cracks appeared on the ground, spreading in all directions.</p><p>In the Dayan elixir furnace, Lu Ming exerted all his strength. The Laws of Chaos protected his body and the Holy power filled his body. However, the terrifying vibration continued to hit him, causing his injuries to worsen.</p><p>Not long after, the swordfiend had attacked for more than a hundred times. Lu Ming’s aura was extremely weak and he was severely injured.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt that he was starting to have difficulty controlling the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As expected, when the sword fiend slashed down again, the Dayan elixir furnace trembled and began to shrink rapidly. Finally, it turned into a ray of light and flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body appeared in the deep pit.</p><p>“Hahaha, kid, you’ve finally come out. Let’s see how you’re going to Stop Me Now.”</p><p>Sword fiend laughed sinisterly, his killing intent thick.</p><p>In order to deal with Lu Ming, he had expended a large amount of Yuan Qi. Now, he was not even confident that he could break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>All of this was Lu Ming’s fault. He would make Lu Ming die an ugly death..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
