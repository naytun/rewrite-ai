The terrifying pressure made the burly young man from the purple flame villa change his expression as he felt the terrible pressure.</p><p>He bellowed in rage and the purple flames on his body bloomed, forming a purple beast that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm was unstoppable. There was nothing it could not break. With a slash, the purple beast exploded, but the palm did not stop.</p><p>The other party’s expression changed again, and he blocked it with both hands. Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on the man’s arm. The man screamed in pain and his body flew out, falling heavily on the ground. His arms were completely twisted. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face was pale.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>Previously, on the street, Lu Ming could not even withstand a palm strike from a great sage in great mastery. How could he be so terrifying now and injure him so badly with one palm?</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, he would have been dead.</p><p>how dare you hurt the people of my purple flame villa! Let me see your combat strength!</p><p>In the purple flame villa, another young man shouted. With a swish, his figure pounced toward Lu Ming. His cultivation of the great saint in the great circle was fully released.</p><p>This person was no weaker than the number one genius of the WAN family, Wan Zhengyang. In fact, he might even be slightly stronger.</p><p>“Violet meteorite critical strike!”</p><p>The man roared. It was as if he had turned into a flame. He punched out continuously with both fists. Balls of purple flames shot towards Lu Ming like meteorites. This was a terrifying divine ability. It was shockingly powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He circulated the chaos law and activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique. His palm was like a knife, and he slashed a hundred times in an instant.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, the meteorite-like attack exploded like fireworks when Lu Ming’s palm struck it.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed through the flames, but the flames did not touch his body. He quickly approached the genius of the purple flame villa, and a terrifying attack was aimed at him.</p><p>“Violet meteorite critical strike, combine!”</p><p>die! the Paragon of the purple flame villa shouted. The flames burned fiercely as he pushed his hands out slowly. A huge fireball, like a Purple Sun, pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed. The Dragon’s Roar reverberated in his body. He pointed with his finger and the chaotic finger of tribulation burst forth. A huge finger condensed and pointed at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion sounded out, and the sky continuously trembled. There were experts protecting the buildings below, or else they would have exploded.</p><p>In the end, the primal Chaos tribulation finger crushed over like a god, exploding the sun with a single finger. The scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sovereign from the purple flame villa was sent flying back. He was only able to stabilize himself after flying for more than 10000 meters, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p>He was actually defeated by a great sage in the Great Perfection realm. How could this be possible?</p><p>the law of chaos! He is one of the sons of God, the son of chaos!</p><p>Someone exclaimed. The others looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>It was no wonder that the son of chaos was so terrifying.</p><p>“Still not getting lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and chided indifferently.</p><p>The people from the purple flame villa blushed and left dejectedly.</p><p>Since Lu Ming and the rest had just arrived, they had been looking at them with contempt.</p><p>Almost all of the top heaven’s favorites from the ancient Moon Holy Land had been to the heavenly Emperor City. They had seen them before, but Lu Ming and the others had not been to the heavenly Emperor City. Their first impression was that Lu Ming and the others were very weak, and they looked down on them from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p>Previously, the two geniuses of the purple flame villa happened to see Lu Ming being sent flying by a great sage in one palm strike. This made them look down on him even more.</p><p>This time, the people who helped Ouyang Wushuang in the purple flame villa were all at the peak of the great saint realm or even great saint perfection. He believed that the people invited by the other princes were the same. With Lu Ming’s cultivation base, it was almost useless.</p><p>Therefore, as soon as Lu Ming and the rest returned, they mocked them. However, they did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly explode and his combat strength was so strong that it was abnormal.</p><p>They were also prodigies, but Lu Ming had surpassed them by three levels. They were too ashamed to stay here after he had defeated them.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Long Chen smiled faintly.</p><p>After that, they all returned to their residences and began cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>However, the next morning, Ouyang Wushuang sent someone to invite them to meet again.</p><p>It was still the same Hall as before, and everyone took their seats.</p><p>The only difference was that the paragons of the purple flame villa now looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang smiled. He had received the news of the battle between Lu Ming and the heaven’s pride expert of the purple flame villa.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was beyond his imagination. He could actually suppress a great saint in the Great Perfection realm. However, the stronger Lu Ming was, the more advantageous it would be for him.</p><p>“Prince Wushuang, why have you summoned us so early?”</p><p>One of the geniuses from the purple flame villa asked.</p><p>“Ouyang Wuji has sent me an invitation to a banquet for me and everyone else!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained the reason.</p><p>“Ouyang Wuji invited us to a banquet. I’m afraid that things are not as simple as they seem!”</p><p>Someone said with a frown.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji was one of the three competing princes and had the support of the only sacred Hall. He had even invited many heaven’s favorites from the ancient Moon Holy Land to help him. It would not be easy to invite them to a banquet.</p><p>no matter what, he’s inviting us openly. I doubt he’ll dare to play dirty!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The test for the three princes had yet to begin. Ouyang Wuji would not dare to play any dirty tricks and harm them. Otherwise, he would be disqualified immediately.</p><p>that’s right. Therefore, we can’t lose our momentum. Let’s go and see what Ouyang Wuji is up to!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>No one had any objections. It would be beneficial for them to meet Ouyang Wuji and his helpers first.</p><p>Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated!</p><p>After chatting for a while, Ouyang Wushuang led his men towards a vast Palace when it was almost time.</p><p>That Palace was Ouyang Wuji’s residence. Someone brought them to a spacious courtyard.</p><p>haha, ninth brother, you’re here. And all the heroes, please have a seat!</p><p>A young man wearing a purple-gold robe and a purple-gold crown laughed heartily as he came out to welcome them.</p><p>“Sixth brother, you don’t have to be so polite!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile.</p><p>Among the princes, Ouyang Wushuang was ranked ninth, Ouyang Wuji was ranked sixth, and Ouyang wudao was ranked first. He was known as the first Prince.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji and Ouyang Wushuang sat at the head of the table.</p><p>Below Ouyang Wuji sat more than ten young men. Each of them had an extraordinary aura.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming and the rest were seated below Ouyang Wuji. Both parties were sizing each other up.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Qiu Yue at a glance and his gaze fell on her.</p><p>Qiu Yue seemed to have sensed Lu Ming’s gaze. She frowned and cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It seems like you really can’t recognize me!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>the second Prince of the Golden Crow, mo lang of the Skywolf tower …</p><p>Huang Ling muttered and looked across..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
