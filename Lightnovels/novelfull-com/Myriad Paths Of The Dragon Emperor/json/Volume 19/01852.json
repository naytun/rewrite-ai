Not only did he come from a good family, but his father was also the number one master in barren city. He also had amazing talent. He had a low-class heaven spiritual body and the potential to become a sovereign. He was known as the only person with the potential to become a sovereign in barren city for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>...</p><p>With his status and talent, his path had been smooth.</p><p>Ever since he was young, he had always been able to get whatever he wanted.</p><p>This time, not only did Qiu Yue dare to disobey him, but Lu Ming also dared to injure him, insult him, and even kill so many experts from the HA family. He must make Lu Ming regret it.</p><p>However, the next moment, he shouted in fear,” “Quick, increase the speed!”</p><p>That was because at that moment, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s speed suddenly increased greatly. It was as if they were traveling through the void. Their speed was shocking as they approached them at an extreme speed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s speed suddenly increased greatly because of bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles cast a spacetime law that enveloped the two of them. The two of them seemed to be able to travel through the void.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, we’re almost at the HA family’s house. Hurry up!”</p><p>Hammerte kept shouting, his body trembling in fear.</p><p>“Young master, you go first. I’ll block them!”</p><p>let’s go! the absolute Saint said and threw Hamilton forward. He stopped in his tracks and a saber appeared in his hand. He slashed dozens of times at Lu Ming and Nangong wuque.</p><p>As for hammerte, he was frantically running forward.</p><p>This place was not far from the HA family mansion. As long as he could escape to the HA family, his life would be saved.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>The bubble opened its mouth and spat out a transparent bubble. Then, it disappeared. In the next moment, it reappeared on the absolute saint’s body and enveloped him.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and a huge finger shot towards the other party.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s two scimitars spun rapidly, turning into a destructive storm that swept toward the other party.</p><p>There was no suspense.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, and Qiu Yue could fight against an ordinary absolute Saint in the upper tier. They could even defeat and kill their opponent. Now that the three of them had joined forces, their power was even more terrifying.</p><p>The attacks of the three landed, and the absolute Saint expert didn’t even have time to scream before he was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue rushed past them without stopping.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The people who followed from the distance were dumbfounded. The shock in their hearts was unimaginable.</p><p>An absolute Saint in the Great Perfection realm was instantly killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s cultivation base was clearly only at the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>these people are definitely the peerless heaven’s favorites from outside barren city. Interesting!</p><p>we’re almost at the HA family mansion. I wonder what the result is?”</p><p>Many people followed, wanting to find out what was going on.</p><p>In front of him, Hamilton saw that the absolute Saint expert had been killed in an instant. He was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He held his breath and rushed forward.</p><p>A vast and majestic mansion appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Hammerte was overjoyed. They had arrived at the HA family’s mansion. Once they arrived, he would be safe. Next, it would be his crazy revenge.</p><p>However, behind him, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had no intention of stopping. They were charging towards him at an alarming speed.</p><p>Hammerte was almost scared to death. He shouted as he charged,” “Help, help! Father, help!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were approaching hammerty at top speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and an absolute Saint weapon pierced through the void toward Hamilton.</p><p>Hamerty wanted to Dodge in fear but he realized that he could not do so at all. His ability was far inferior to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Audacious fanatic, you’re courting death!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout rang out from the HA family mansion. A ray of light shot out and collided with Lu Ming’s absolute Saint weapon, knocking it away.</p><p>Then, a figure flickered out, and a terrifying aura bloomed in all directions.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Hammerty was ecstatic.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man in a brocade robe. He looked a bit like hamerty. He was hamerty’s father, ha Zheng, the No. 1 master of barren city and an expert of the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>“Ha Zheng has appeared. The young man and woman are in danger!”</p><p>The people who were following him all stopped far away.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also stopped.</p><p>“Father, these two people are extremely audacious. They have killed several elders. Hurry up and kill them. No, leave that woman behind. I want her to suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>Hammerte shouted.</p><p>Seeing ha Zheng, hammerty was relieved. He knew that he was fine now. Next, he would take his revenge.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had actually made him look so miserable. He should be hacked into pieces.</p><p>“He should be killed!”</p><p>Ha Zheng’s gaze was very cold as he swept a cold glance at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue. The two of them moved, turning into two shadows and retreating.</p><p>“You want to leave? die!”</p><p>Ha Zheng shouted and threw a punch. A vast fist force pierced through the void and headed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“I can’t resist it, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming was about to ask bubbles to open the space-time Tunnel and leave this place.</p><p>However, at this moment, a thousand-meter long sword radiance appeared and slashed at ha Zheng’s fist radiance.</p><p>With a loud boom, the sword radiance and the fist radiance disappeared at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not leave but stopped in the distance.</p><p>Ha Zheng’s gaze looked up into the sky, where a white-haired elder appeared.</p><p>This person had a long sword on his back and looked like a Sage.</p><p>“It’s the mo clan’s clan head!”</p><p>Around them, someone exclaimed.</p><p>The mo family was one of the seven most powerful forces in barren city. The head of the mo family was an absolute Saint in the great circle. Why did he help Lu Ming and block ha Zheng’s attack?</p><p>Not only the others, even Lu Ming himself was puzzled.</p><p>It was his first time in barren city and he didn’t know anyone.</p><p>“Mo Qingshan, you know those two?”</p><p>Ha Zheng asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“I don’t know him!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know you and you want to stop me? It seems like you are tired of living!”</p><p>A hint of killing intent flashed through ha Zheng’s eyes.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, what big words you have!”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice came from another direction, and then a burly middle-aged man appeared.</p><p>At the same time, other figures also appeared in other directions.</p><p>Including mo Qingshan, there were a total of six figures.</p><p>“Leaders of the six major forces, what’s going on? The leaders of the six major forces have all arrived!”</p><p>could it be because of that young man? that’s impossible!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Upon seeing the six figures, the scene broke out into a discussion.</p><p>These six people were the leaders of the other six forces in barren city. Each of them was in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. Why were they all here at the same time?</p><p>Many people were puzzled.</p><p>“What’s the matter for the six of you to come to my ha family?” ha Zheng’s face darkened. Could it be because of those two?”</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“I’ve already said that we don’t know those two. We’re here to look for you!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan squinted his eyes and said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
