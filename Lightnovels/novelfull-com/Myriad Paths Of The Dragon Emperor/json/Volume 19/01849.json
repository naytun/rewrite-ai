There were also descriptions of various precious materials and even their origins. Lu Ming thought that perhaps the Dayan elixir Palace had information on the other two materials to refine the soul recovery pill.</p><p>“Go, let’s go out for a walk!”</p><p>Ice curtain waved her hand.</p><p>“Senior, this junior will take his leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists. He planned to return to the Dayan elixir Palace first and take a look.</p><p>“Master, take care!”</p><p>Qiu Yue also bowed to the ice screen and left the one and only divine temple with Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the shenyuan Empire first. When Ouyang Wushuang, Long Chen, and Huang Ling saw Lu Ming and Qiu Yue walking together, they were surprised.</p><p>Especially Huang Ling, who had a complicated look in her eyes.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Huang Ling bade farewell to Ouyang Wushuang. They brought Ouyang Moli along and stepped onto the teleportation formation, leaving the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the heavenly Emperor city’s yuan mountain sacred Institute will be holding an official meeting in two months. Do you want to go?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>1 don’t know. We’ll see when the time comes. Qiu Yue has lost her memory, so I’ll see if 1 can find the materials to refine the soul recovery pill. If I’m not around, you can go to heavenly Emperor City first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He didn’t hide Qiu Yue’s matter from Long Chen and Feng Ling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Phoenix spirit and Long Chen nodded and returned to Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect respectively.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue and Ouyang Moli back to the Dayan elixir Hall.</p><p>“Junior Brother, you’re back!”</p><p>Just as he returned to the Dayan elixir Palace, he met Xue ningxin.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had left Xue ningxin in the Dayan elixir Palace to cultivate with uncle Kong.</p><p>“Senior Sister, are you used to living here?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“En, it’s alright!”</p><p>Xue ningxin nodded and looked at Qiu Yue and Ouyang Moli with a curious expression.</p><p>“Let me introduce you …”</p><p>Lu Ming introduced them to each other.</p><p>“What a powerful Constitution!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice rang out. Uncle Kong held onto his walking stick and slowly walked out. His eyes, however, landed on Ouyang Moli’s body and were filled with shock.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, he’s my new disciple, Ouyang Moli!”</p><p>Lu Ming introduced.</p><p>“Good, good, this is a great opportunity, good!”</p><p>Uncle Kong sighed.</p><p>Now that Ouyang Moli’s bloodline had been awakened, with uncle Kong’s cultivation, he could naturally see that Ouyang Moli was extraordinary.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, 1’11 leave Mo Li in the great Yan elixir Palace to cultivate in the future. I’ll still need you to guide him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, don’t worry. These old bones of mine are idle anyway. 1 can still give them some pointers!</p><p>Uncle Kong revealed a smile.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue and Ouyang Moli around the Dayan elixir Hall.</p><p>The interior of the Dayan elixir Palace was huge. Other than the main hall, there were many smaller halls, secret chambers, alchemy rooms, rooms, and so on. After making a round, Lu Ming arranged rooms for Qiu Yue and the rest and came to a secret chamber.</p><p>This secret chamber was filled with all kinds of pill recipes, formulas, and records of all kinds of precious sacred medicines and materials collected by the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>There were storage rings placed there, and each storage ring contained a large number of Jade tokens.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at them one by one.</p><p>This amount of work was huge because there were too many Jade plates.</p><p>After half a month, Lu Ming finally found the prescription for the soul recovery pill.</p><p>“There are records!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. As the three main ingredients of the soul recovery pill were very rare, there were relevant information about the three main ingredients recorded on the book. For example, the location and the possibility of having such ingredients.</p><p>The two main materials that Lu Ming was lacking were the Grand Lunar treasure Lotus and the Berserker crystal.</p><p>“There are only two places that might have the Grand astral treasure Lotus.</p><p>One is the land of ten thousand demons, and the other is the land of ten thousand demons!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>These two places weren’t in Mount Yuan. They were too far away and were the other two places in the ten lands of the yuan continent.</p><p>the records on this are from countless years ago. Perhaps there’s also a Grand astral treasure Lotus in Mount Yuan!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and looked at the place where the Berserker crystal might appear.</p><p>There were three places where Berserker crystals could appear. Two of them were not in Mount Yuan, and only one was there.</p><p>“Ancient Savage barren realm? The savage barren ancient realm to the North of Mount Yuan?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He decided to make a trip to the savage barren ancient realm.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bade farewell to uncle Kong and left Ouyang Moli and Xue ningxin to cultivate here. He and Qiu Yue went to the Phoenix Palace and used the teleportation array there to head to the savage barren ancient region.</p><p>However, the savage barren ancient realm was only a legendary place. It was impossible to directly teleport there. They were teleported to a sacred place in the North of Mount Yuan, then took a flying shuttle and flew in the direction of the legendary Savage barren ancient realm.</p><p>After flying for more than half a month, they arrived at a desolate mountain range.</p><p>the ancient Savage barren realm is a place of ancient legends. Is it still there? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>However, since they were already here, they continued to search.</p><p>After a few days, an ancient city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The two of them landed outside the ancient city and saw two large words on the city gate: Barren city!</p><p>What was the relationship between the barren city and the ancient Savage barren realm?</p><p>According to the legends, the ancient Savage barren realm should be in this area. The two of them decided to settle down in barren city first and explore.</p><p>The two of them walked into the city. This ancient city seemed to have experienced a long time, and the aura of the vicissitudes of time was everywhere.</p><p>There were many people in the city. At a glance, most of them were cultivators with strong auras.</p><p>There were many Saint realm martial artists.</p><p>The two of them found a restaurant and went to the third floor. They ordered some food and wine to see if they could hear any news.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Not far from Lu Ming and the rest, there was a table of people. One of the young men was looking at Qiu Yue with a burning gaze.</p><p>she’s indeed very beautiful. 1 wonder which family she’s from. However, it’s his fortune to have caught the young master’s eye in barren city. I’ll call the girl over to have a drink with him!</p><p>A thin middle-aged man laughed and flattered.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The young man nodded, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p>He had never seen such a beautiful woman in the barren city. He was tempted.</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man chuckled and walked towards Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. He walked past Lu Ming and said to Qiu Yue,”Young lady, my young master invites you over for a drink. Come with me!”</p><p>There was a commanding tone in his voice. After he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away. It was as if Qiu Yue would definitely follow him if he said so.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue just sat there without moving..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
