He realized that he was in a desolate Valley. It was pitch-black and empty. Even bubbles were not by his side.</p><p>...</p><p>Suddenly, a few figures condensed in front of him. They were blurry and their faces could not be seen clearly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The few figures pounced on Lu Ming one after another, as fast as lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. The Laws of Chaos covered his entire body. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and punched out with both fists.</p><p>The figures also launched various attacks. Some were punches, some were palm strikes, and some were finger forces. However, they all had one thing in common: they all used the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were consecutive collisions and a few figures were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>“He can indeed use the Laws of Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>He had heard from Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others that this super power, purgatory Valley, was extremely mysterious. The human figures condensed here could use the same laws as the ones who entered. The deeper one went into the valley, the stronger the power of the person who used the laws would be.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed toward the few figures, increasing his strength.</p><p>There were a few consecutive explosions and the few figures were defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although these figures could use the Laws of Chaos, they were very weak. They were far inferior to Lu Ming and naturally could not withstand a single blow.</p><p>After defeating a few figures, Lu Ming stepped forward. He had not gone far when a few more figures appeared.</p><p>These figures could still use the Laws of Chaos and were more powerful than the previous figures. However, they were far inferior to Lu Ming and were still defeated by him in a few moves.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming defeated dozens of groups of figures. The figures he encountered were getting stronger and stronger. The power of the law of chaos was getting closer and closer to Lu Ming’s. They could even use the finger of chaos just like Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming finally felt the pressure. He circulated the chaos laws at full force and fought with the other party.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A total of three figures pointed their fingers at the same time. Three huge fingers came from three directions and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was highly focused and his figure changed. At the moment his figure changed, he pointed out three fingers at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Similarly, three huge fingers formed and pointed towards the other party.</p><p>The six huge fingers collided with each other and were in a stalemate in the air.</p><p>However, in the end, Lu Ming was still stronger. The other party’s chaotic finger of tribulation collapsed and his body was also destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>the power of these figures ‘chaotic finger of tribulation is very close to mine. If it was a little stronger, it would not be so easy for me to win. But this is good. It will help me improve!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and took another step forward.</p><p>He had not walked far when another figure appeared and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, the figure’s mastery of the Laws of Chaos was no weaker than Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming and the three figures engaged in an intense battle. The Laws of Chaos pervaded the air and collided continuously.</p><p>It was extremely rare to collide with the same laws. This way, one could better see one’s shortcomings and improve.</p><p>It was obvious that the great emperors had spent a lot of effort to build such a place.</p><p>This time, the battle lasted for a full half an hour before Lu Ming finally defeated the three figures.</p><p>“My chaos finger of tribulation is close to seventy percent!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming’s chaos finger of tribulation was about 69% complete.</p><p>Now, it was close to 70% complete.</p><p>If he cultivated like this, it wouldn’t take long for him to reach 70%.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. This time, the figure that appeared was even more powerful. After fighting with Lu Ming for more than an hour, Lu Ming still could not defeat the other party. In the end, his Holy energy ran out and he could only retreat.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming retreated, the few figures would not pursue him.</p><p>After Lu Ming’s holy power recovered, he continued to fight.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>A few figures were fighting in an extremely intense manner.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming kept pointing out the chaos finger of tribulation. The power of the chaos finger of tribulation suddenly soared.</p><p>The chaotic fingers of tribulation that the three figures pointed out were instantly crushed by Lu Ming. The terrifying force shattered the three figures. “Primal Chaos tribulation finger, seventy percent!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and revealed a faint smile.</p><p>Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation had broken through in just two days of cultivation.</p><p>Although the difference between 69% and 70% seemed very close, the difference in power was very large.</p><p>Once it broke through 70%, it would be another level.</p><p>For an ordinary martial artist, it was impossible to break through 70% without the cultivation of an absolute Saint realm. Moreover, the chaotic finger was even more difficult to cultivate.</p><p>Of course, all the rules were meant to be broken by geniuses.</p><p>This was truly a good place. No wonder all the geniuses of the entire Yuan mountain would gather here.</p><p>A cultivation sanctuary jointly built by several great emperors was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>Furthermore, there would also be a Dao lecture by a great emperor. The geniuses would clash with each other. This way, the cultivation speed of this batch of geniuses would definitely increase, forcing out their potential and pushing them to a higher realm.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed an excited expression and continued to move forward.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating in the purgatory Valley.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, two months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated tirelessly and his apocalyptic finger of chaos progressed very quickly. In less than two months, he had reached 80% mastery in the apocalyptic finger of chaos.</p><p>One had to know that the higher the sacred art was, the harder it was to improve. The closer it was to perfection, the more difficult it was to improve it.</p><p>In less than two months, he was able to raise it to eighty percent. The speed was already very terrifying.</p><p>If he were to cultivate normally, he might not even be able to achieve it even after several years.</p><p>Moreover, as he continued to fight with those figures, Lu Ming’s Saint energy was constantly being condensed and strengthened. It was approaching the great saint perfection at a rapid speed.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming felt the Saint energy in his body surge like a flood after a huge battle with three figures. It was unbelievably fast.</p><p>“I’m about to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After nearly two months of continuous fighting, his cultivation had finally reached zero. He was about to break through to the great sage perfection.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated and sat down cross-legged. He took out a large pile of raw gemstones and began to strive for the great saint perfection realm.</p><p>In a luxurious courtyard in the yuan mountain Saint Academy, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, mo lang and the others were all standing respectfully in front of a green-robed young man.</p><p>“The Golden Crow Crown Prince is dead? Hehe, How dare you!”</p><p>The green-robed young man said. His voice was very gentle, but everyone could hear the cold killing intent in it.</p><p>Mo lang, the second Prince of the Golden Crow, and the others trembled.</p><p>This man was the peerless genius of the Feng clan, Feng wuchen.</p><p>He was a top figure who had reached the absolute Saint realm a long time ago. Even in the yuan mountain Saint Academy, which was full of geniuses, he was a very famous existence..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
