They were formed by extremely pure sword energy and were stuck in the ground.</p><p>This was the source of the sword!</p><p>Dozens of sword fiends surrounded the three sword sources.</p><p>Swordfiend was able to absorb the energy from the sword source to strengthen itself. Hence, there was a swordfiend guarding the vicinity of every sword source.</p><p>There were three sword sources here, so naturally, there were even more swordfiends guarding the place.</p><p>“Three sword sources!”</p><p>Wu Chu’s gentle eyes shone with a fiery light.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>1 can’t fight them head-on. Otherwise, I’ll alert the other swordfiends and it’ll be more troublesome. The best way is to attract the swordfiends and then seize the three swordfiends instantly with my powerful combat strength!</p><p>Wu Chu’s eyes shone with an astute light as he continued to make arrangements,” all of you, and the rest of you, go and draw away those sword fiends. We have the strongest cultivation, so we’ll seize three sword sources in an instant!</p><p>Wu Chu pointed at Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and some other people who had joined the team later.</p><p>“We’ll lure them?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>that’s right. In the sword tomb, only by cooperating with each other can we maximize our strength and obtain more resources. Don’t worry, after we obtain the sword source, we’ll split it equally. We won’t give you a single cent less!</p><p>Wu Chu said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go lure them!”</p><p>That person nodded, and the others had no objections.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest approached the swordfiend from different directions.</p><p>When they were within a certain distance, the swordfiends discovered them and their eyes shot out a sharp glint.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the swordfiend turned into streaks of sword light and chased after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Qiu Yue, turned around, and ran.</p><p>The others did the same. They all turned around and ran off into the distance, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Beside the sword source, there were only seven or eight sword fiends left.</p><p>it’s good to find some bait. It can save us a lot of effort!</p><p>A middle-aged burly man at the side of the Wu area sneered. He looked in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had left and revealed a mocking smile, let’s not waste any time. Let’s take action and seize the three sword sources! let’s go! Wu Chu said. He took a step forward and attacked the eight sword spirits. His cultivation was at the great circle of the absolute Saint realm, and with one palm, two sword spirits were destroyed and turned into energy that sank into the ground.</p><p>The other people beside chief Wu also attacked. Their auras bloomed, and they were all absolute Saints.</p><p>Everyone attacked together. Seven to eight sword fiends did not hold on for long before they were killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were running at top speed, but the sword fiend behind them was surprisingly fast. It was closing the distance between them.</p><p>this sword Qi is so fast. It’s like a flying sword light. And there’s an absolute Saint Sword Qi among them!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s stop here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue suddenly stopped. With a wave of her hand, two curved blades flew out and spun rapidly, sweeping towards the few swordfiends.</p><p>One of the sword demons was equivalent to a lower-tier absolute Saint, while the others were all great saints. They weren’t Qiu Yue’s opponents at all. The two curved blades swept over, and the sword demons collapsed, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>“Ah!” “All!”</p><p>At this moment, shrill screams came from several other directions.</p><p>It was obvious that it was the screams of the other people who had attracted the sword fiend.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned even colder. Then, he and Qiu Yue returned to their original spot.</p><p>At that moment, Wu Chu and the rest had already obtained three sword sources and were retreating. They were a little surprised to see Lu Ming and Lin fan return.</p><p>it seems like these two are heaven’s favorites. Even an absolute Saint Sword fiend can’t do anything to them!</p><p>Wu Chu’s eyes flashed, and then he revealed a warm smile, Lu Ming, return to the team. We’ll retreat first!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He and Qiu Yue remained silent and returned to the team, retreating.</p><p>Not long after, a deafening roar sounded from the place where he had obtained the sword source. It was obvious that the sword fiend had returned and let out an angry roar when it realized that the sword source had disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, a few more people who had gone to attract the sword fiend returned to the group. These people’s cultivation was not weak, and they did not die at the hands of the sword fiend.</p><p>“Chief Wu, where’s the sword source? you said you were going to split it evenly!”</p><p>One of them looked at chief Wu.</p><p>haha, don’t worry. I’ve only obtained three sword sources so far. I’ll keep them for the time being. When 1 obtain more sword sources in the future, I’ll naturally take them out and divide them equally!</p><p>Chief Wu laughed.</p><p>The man snorted and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. A sharp glint flashed across Qiu Yue’s eyes but the two of them did not say anything.</p><p>The group continued forward, and not long after, chief Wu sensed something again.</p><p>“There’s another sword source ahead!”</p><p>Chief Wu revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The group moved forward and found a sword source in a Col.</p><p>A sword source would protect a relatively small number of sword fiends, only around three.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and exterminate these sword fiends!”</p><p>Wu Chu said.</p><p>There were only a dozen swordfiends that did not need to be lured away. Lu Ming and the rest had good combat strength. They would probably be useful if they were kept.</p><p>A cold smile hung on the corner of Wu Chu’s mouth. The next moment, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>On the other side, a dozen figures flashed and appeared.</p><p>These were all martial arts experts. They were clearly the ones who had entered the sword tomb before.</p><p>There were a lot of people in the sword tomb. Every few days, there would be people who would come to take risks in the sword tomb. No one knew how many people were in the sword tomb.</p><p>Clearly, the other party was also someone who had entered the sword tomb to take risks.</p><p>The other party also saw Lu Ming and the others. Their gazes were unfriendly, and some of them revealed killing intent.</p><p>The faces of Wu Chu and the others darkened.</p><p>you guys can get lost. That sword source is ours!</p><p>Someone in the crowd said coldly.</p><p>“You’re the ones who should get lost!”</p><p>Chief Wu sneered.</p><p>How could he miss the sword source that was right in front of him?</p><p>His gaze shifted and landed on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“You guys go and stop them. We’ll go and get the sword source!”</p><p>Chief Wu sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and a few others.</p><p>These people were the ones who had gone to attract the swordfiend. They were the ones they had found to be the bait.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>you want us to stop them? what a joke. There are many experts among them. If we go over, we’ll just be courting death. 1 refuse!</p><p>A short and fat man shook his head and refused.</p><p>There was definitely no lack of experts among those who could form teams to travel in the sword tomb. At least half of the other party’s group were absolute Saints. There might even be experts in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm like Chu Wu.</p><p>Asking them to stop the other party was clearly asking them to die.</p><p>Chief Wu’s eyes turned cold, don’t worry. You can stop them for a while. When we get the sword source, we will go and help you.. 1 believe you can stop them in a short time!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
