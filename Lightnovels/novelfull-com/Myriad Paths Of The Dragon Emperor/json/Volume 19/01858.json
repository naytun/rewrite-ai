Everyone who went to battle, be it beasts or desolate race experts, were all defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>...</p><p>To Lu Ming, he felt no pressure at all when he was at the same level. It was not a challenge at all.</p><p>Within a short period of time, Lu Ming had won nineteen matches in a row.</p><p>he’s so strong. This person’s combat strength is truly shocking. It feels like he’s unfathomable!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The surrounding desolate race members did not feel dejected or angry because of the desolate race expert’s defeat. Instead, they became more and more excited.</p><p>On the grandstand at the highest point, a few powerful desolate race existences were also nodding their heads.</p><p>“This outsider’s combat strength is pretty good!”</p><p>“Let desolate blade try!”</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>Not long after, a figure entered the cage battle arena.</p><p>This person looked very young, about the same age as Lu Ming. He was extremely burly, at least 2.5 or 2.6 meters tall, much taller than Lu Ming.</p><p>The muscles on his body bulged as if he was filled with infinite power.</p><p>it’s desolate blade! Desolate blade has made his move!</p><p>desolate blade has already won 30 matches in a row. I wonder if he can stop this outsider!</p><p>Huang Ren has a low-class celestial spiritual body. He might be able to fight!</p><p>Upon seeing this youth, even more members of the desolate race became excited, as they looked forward to the next battle.</p><p>“Kid, you’re very strong, but your winning streak has come to an end after meeting me!”</p><p>Barren blade held a huge axe and looked at Lu Ming with a fighting spirit.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He was still holding the long spear that was condensed by holy power.</p><p>“Arrogant, take this!”</p><p>Barren blade shouted and charged at Lu Ming with his battle axe.</p><p>He stomped on the ground and charged at Lu Ming like a wild beast. When he was not far from Lu Ming, he rushed into the sky and looked down. The giant axe chopped down at Lu Ming with great force. The aura was shocking.</p><p>inferior celestial spiritual body? it’s just a law. It’s just an ordinary law of strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he swept the long spear out.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>There was a loud boom. Just like Lu Ming’s previous opponent, desolate blade was sent flying like a cannonball. He only stopped when he reached the edge of the cage battle arena. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming’s power was unfathomable and he was completely invincible.</p><p>“Thank you for showing mercy!”</p><p>Barren blade cupped his fists and left.</p><p>He had lost, and there was no need to fight.</p><p>“Another move!”</p><p>I’m afraid this person also has a heavenly spiritual body, and his level is even higher!</p><p>1 wonder if this person can win 100 consecutive victories!</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated desolate blade in one move. Everyone knew that they had underestimated Lu Ming. Many people were looking forward to seeing if Lu Ming could achieve a hundred-win streak.</p><p>It was not easy to obtain a hundred-win streak. Those who could do so were the rare elites of the desolate race.</p><p>“Fight again!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, his fighting spirit soaring. His voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>The next person to fight was not as powerful as barren blade, so Lu Ming won easily.</p><p>Lu Ming launched his crazy winning streak mode. Moreover, he only needed one move for each battle. He gave off an unfathomable feeling. No one knew how strong Lu Ming’s combat strength was.</p><p>30 wins, 40 wins, 50 wins …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had achieved a 90-win streak.</p><p>At this moment, an expert descended from the sky and looked at Lu Ming. “Kid, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>Lu Ming, very good. Your combat strength is very strong, and you are worthy of the desolate race’s respect. However, let’s end today’s battle here. There are only a limited number of great sage great mastery experts here today. We will need time to arrange them. The next ten battles will be fought in two days!</p><p>The desolate race expert said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The further they went, the stronger the enemies they would face. It was normal for the other party to send stronger great sages.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid. He had yet to meet his match in a battle of the same level.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to the secret chamber. The battle for the day had come to an end.</p><p>On the second day, it was not Lu Ming’s turn to fight but bubbles.</p><p>When bubbles entered the arena, everyone was a little stunned.</p><p>It was unknown if it was due to a problem with bubbles ‘Constitution or something else, but she had never grown up. She always looked the same as when she had just transformed, two or three years old, pink and tender.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that it might be because the growth period of the top ten beasts was longer.</p><p>A two to three-year-old little girl was truly a sight to behold. However, upon knowing that bubbles ‘cultivation base had also reached the great sage realm, everyone’s lips twitched.</p><p>A two or three-year-old little girl actually had the cultivation of a great sage?</p><p>“No, she doesn’t seem to be a human, but a demon!”</p><p>demons. Even if you’re a demon, you’re still so young after taking on human form. You’re not that old, are you? ”</p><p>that’s true. I wonder what kind of combat strength he has!</p><p>As the people around them discussed, the battle began. In the next moment, the battle ended.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>Many people did not even see how the battle had ended. Bubbles had only spat out a bubble and her opponent had been sent flying with heavy injuries.</p><p>“I want to continue fighting!”</p><p>Bubbles’s tender voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>For the rest of the battle, the entire arena could only be described as silent.</p><p>Bubbles was the same as Lu Ming the day before. She unleashed her crushing mode and was even faster than Lu Ming.</p><p>No matter who it was, bubbles only had toot and wave her little hands, and the other party would be sent flying with heavy injuries.</p><p>Not long after, bubbles also achieved a 90-win streak.</p><p>At this point, they had to stop and fight another day.</p><p>As the bubble had only used a very short amount of time, today’s battle continued.</p><p>After that, Qiu Yue appeared.</p><p>It was already shocking that Qiu Yue had reached the great saint perfection at her age, but the following battle was even more shocking.</p><p>Sweep, another sweep.</p><p>Qiu Yue had also won 90 consecutive battles before ending the battle.</p><p>For the next two days, Lu Ming, bubbles, and Qiu Yue did not participate in the battle. Instead, it was the others ‘battle.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming finally welcomed his 91st battle.</p><p>The desolate race had prepared for a few days, and the experts they sent out were indeed stronger.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, there was no difference in a battle between those of the same level, unless they were the children of God.</p><p>It was still a sweep.</p><p>91 consecutive wins, 92 consecutive wins, 93 consecutive wins …</p><p>Soon, it was 99 consecutive wins.</p><p>During the 100th battle, the desolate race finally sent out a heavyweight figure.</p><p>This person was a young elite of the desolate race. His spiritual body had reached a high grade heavenly spiritual body, and his strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the combat strength of the desolate race, under the same conditions as the spirit body, was much stronger than the elites of the outside world.</p><p>For example, this elite had a high-tier celestial spiritual body. His laws were not the laws of the king’s path. His talent was comparable to the shenyuan Empire’s Crown Prince, Ouyang wudao. If the two of them were at the same realm, the desolate race member would definitely be stronger.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, he was no different from the other people. He was still easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>100 consecutive wins!</p><p>The crowd cheered.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to achieve 100 consecutive victories. He didn’t expect that an outsider would be able to achieve it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
