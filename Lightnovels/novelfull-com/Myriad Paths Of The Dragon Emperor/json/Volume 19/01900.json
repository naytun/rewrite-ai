The number of people on the mountain peak continued to increase. In the end, there were close to 10000 people.</p><p>However, there were nearly ten thousand people sitting here, but not a single sound was made. No one spoke. On the mountain peak, one could even hear a pin drop.</p><p>The old man didn’t say anything either. He had been resting with his eyes closed.</p><p>Half an hour passed, and no one came. At this time, the old man opened his eyes.</p><p>The moment the old man opened his eyes, everyone had an illusion as if they had suddenly arrived in the starry sky of the universe. However, the next moment, this illusion disappeared without a trace.</p><p>alright, almost everyone has arrived. If there are still people who haven’t arrived, we won’t wait any longer. Today, this old man will be the one to preach!</p><p>The old man spoke in a gentle voice that echoed in everyone’s ears.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits lifted. This elder was indeed a great emperor.</p><p>It was said that the three great emperors who founded the yuan mountain sacred Academy were called Sky Fire great emperor, huntian great emperor, and Wuxiang great emperor.</p><p>Which of the three great emperors was this great emperor?</p><p>“This old man is Wu Xiang. From now on, you can just call me Dean Wu Xiang!”</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat. So this was Emperor formless.</p><p>This was an existence at the peak of the entire Yuan mountain, a figure who stood at the peak of all living beings. He had lived for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>“Now, the lecture begins!”</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice resounded, and everyone immediately focused their attention.</p><p>At this moment, a small bell appeared in Emperor formless’s hand. The small bell flew into the sky and rapidly grew in size.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The small bell trembled and rang. When everyone heard the bell ring, their spirits were instantly lifted. They felt their thoughts become sharper and more focused.</p><p>“What a wonderful Bell!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the Bell’s effect was similar to that of the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Then, rays of light emanated from the small bell. When everyone was enveloped by this light, their thoughts seemed to become more focused.</p><p>this is the Bodhi Bell. I’ve spent several years letting the Bodhi Bell absorb years of Bodhi energy. The Bodhi energy and the Bodhi Bell can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of your Tao comprehension!</p><p>Emperor formless explained.</p><p>“Emperor notionless is really well-prepared for this Dao lecture!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>No wonder almost all the geniuses in the yuan Mountain region had gathered in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Where else would they be able to enjoy such treatment?</p><p>“The Dao I’m talking about isn’t biased toward any particular law, but a great Dao!”</p><p>there are countless nomological laws in the world, but the great Dao is one. Any nomological law can be comprehended from the great Dao. How much you can comprehend depends on your own comprehension ability!</p><p>Emperor formless spoke. As soon as he finished speaking, his body seemed to transform. His figure disappeared and transformed into a world.</p><p>Endless music came from the world, and the light covered everyone.</p><p>This was the most fundamental great Dao, and it was infinitely mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but recall that when he had participated in the Hunyuan sect’s assessment, there had been a stage where he had to comprehend Dao for the abyss. It was very similar to the way the formless Emperor had preached.</p><p>They were all great DAOs that pointed directly to the source.</p><p>At this moment, everyone closed their eyes and silently comprehended the Dao.</p><p>Emperor formless lectured for three days and three nights. After three days and three nights, he stopped.</p><p>However, no one woke up. They were all in a Deep State of enlightenment.</p><p>Emperor formless revealed a warm smile and closed his eyes again.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura rose from one of them. This person had actually broken through.</p><p>Not long after, the man opened his eyes.</p><p>haha, I’ve made a breakthrough in my cultivation. I’ve broken through from the upper tier of a bright Saint to the peak of a bright Saint!</p><p>The man was ecstatic.</p><p>He had been stuck at the great mastery of the bright Saint stage for a long time and had not been able to break through. However, the great Emperor’s lecture this time had allowed him to break through.</p><p>Then, he looked around and his expression turned ugly.</p><p>The others were still comprehending the Dao. He was the first one to wake up.</p><p>The earlier one woke up, the worse one’s comprehension would be, and the less one could comprehend.</p><p>The youth’s excitement from breaking through instantly disappeared without a trace. It was as if a basin of cold water had been poured on his head.</p><p>“Since you’ve ended your enlightenment, you may leave!”</p><p>A voice rang out in this person’s mind.</p><p>It was the voice of Emperor notionless.</p><p>The young man’s heart trembled. He quickly stood up and bowed to the great emperor before leaving.</p><p>However, he didn’t go far. He stood in the void and watched from afar.</p><p>He was very curious as to who would wake up the last among all the heaven’s favorites.</p><p>After this young man, there were many descendants who woke up, and there were also people who broke through their cultivation.</p><p>The great Emperor’s Dao lecture, coupled with the Bodhi Bell’s support, was indeed very effective.</p><p>However, most of the people breaking through cultivation were in the bright Saint realm. The higher the cultivation, the harder it was to break through. It was not so easy to break through to the Supreme Saint realm, let alone those above the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>On the 20th day, half of the people had already woken up and ended their enlightenment.</p><p>Everyone had gained something. The longer they spent comprehending the Dao, the greater their gains.</p><p>Almost all of the people who had finished their enlightenment left the mountain peak and watched from a distance, just like the first youth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this time, another person’s body erupted with a powerful aura.</p><p>Some Supreme Saint geniuses had broken through.</p><p>After that man, a few Supreme Saints broke through to the next realm.</p><p>Of course, great saints were able to break through because they were already at the limit of a certain realm and were about to break through. Therefore, when the great emperor was teaching, they all broke through their limits and entered a higher realm.</p><p>If he had just broken through to a certain realm, it would have been difficult for him to break through so quickly.</p><p>A month later, there were less than 1000 people left.</p><p>One and a half months later, there were only about two hundred people left.</p><p>Two months later, there were only a few dozen people left who were still comprehending Dao.</p><p>The last few dozen people could be said to be the most talented few dozen people.</p><p>Most of them had King physiques and could control King path laws.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, Huang Li, Qiu Yue, and the others were still comprehending the Dao.</p><p>the king physique is truly astonishing. He actually managed to comprehend it for two months!</p><p>how much can 1 gain from comprehending Dao for two months? ”</p><p>Many people were envious, especially those who finished their enlightenment in a dozen days.</p><p>They felt that if they had already gained a lot from comprehending the Dao for more than ten days, then what they had gained from comprehending the Dao for two months would definitely be unimaginable. It would definitely be much more than what they had gained..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
