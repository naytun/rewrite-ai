The Skywolf tower will never let you off. Just wait for your death!”</p><p>...</p><p>An expert from the Skywolf tower roared and transformed into a giant wolf.</p><p>His eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>“You’re speaking as if you’ll let me go if I don’t kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently with a faint sense of disdain.</p><p>It was the other party who had been pressing him step by step. Even if he didn’t kill the other party, the other party wouldn’t let him off. He might as well kill to his heart’s content.</p><p>Killing a Martial Emperor from the other party was a good thing for him.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>It was at this moment that a loud roar came from the distant sky. This roar was earth-shattering, and even the mountains and rivers trembled. Even the sun in the sky seemed to be shaking, as if it were about to be shaken down.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>In the sky, the expressions of the Emperor-level powerhouses changed drastically. Their auras burst out, and their world powers circulated, enveloping the powerhouses of their respective sects.</p><p>As the terrifying sound waves swept past, the defenses set up by the Emperor-level powerhouses actually shook violently.</p><p>As for those who were not protected by Emperor-ranked powerhouses, their bodies exploded in the air like fireworks.</p><p>They died before they could even react.</p><p>Those who were lucky enough to survive turned pale and were terrified.</p><p>What kind of existence was this? with a loud roar, a large number of experts were shaken to death, and even the expressions of the Emperor-ranked experts changed greatly.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a flash of light, and a giant wolf appeared on the scene.</p><p>The giant Wolf’s body was silver in color and its silver fur was shining. It was a hundred thousand feet tall and incomparably huge. It looked at Lu Ming with its cold eyes.</p><p>On his body, there were layers of strange light, like a divine ring, surrounding his body. He was like a god from the legends.</p><p>“World God light, true Emperor expert!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s martial sovereign said in a serious tone.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>It was actually a true Emperor. Needless to say, the other party must have come from the Sirius tower. Even a true Emperor had appeared in the Sirius tower.</p><p>The Martial Emperor realm was divided into the minor Emperor, the medium Emperor, the great emperor, and the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>A minor Emperor’s throne would initially form a small world. However, the small world at this time was in the process of evolution. There was chaos in it, and living beings had no way of entering. Once they entered, they would be ground into pieces.</p><p>Therefore, the small emperor throne was also known as the void Emperor.</p><p>In other words, the small world hadn’t formed yet and living beings couldn’t enter. It was considered an illusory Emperor, not a true Emperor.</p><p>At the middle Emperor level, the small world would be stable and the living beings would be able to survive. This realm was also known as the true Emperor.</p><p>It meant a true Emperor.</p><p>As for the great emperor position, they could control the great Dao and their small worlds could even give birth to living beings. This was even more mysterious and unfathomable. This realm was already the peak of the world.</p><p>As for the heavenly Emperor, he was a legend in the current world.</p><p>The Emperor-level powerhouses that had appeared before were all existences of the minor Emperor realm, the void Emperor realm.</p><p>Now, the Skywolf tower had actually sent out a true Emperor.</p><p>When a true Emperor’s small world was completely formed, their bodies would emit world divine light.</p><p>“Brat, are you the one who killed the fey Thearch of my Skywolf tower?”</p><p>The true Emperor rank Wolf’s eyes were like two suns, shining brightly. It looked at Lu Ming and spoke in a cold voice.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied. He was not afraid even if he was facing a true Emperor.</p><p>If he wanted to fight, then he would fight to his heart’s content. These major forces were closing in on him step by step, so he could only fight to the end.</p><p>“Very well, I will extract your soul and burn it in the fire of purgatory, making you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The true Emperor giant wolf spoke with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Let’s find out his secret first!”</p><p>At this moment, another voice was heard. Then, the void shook and cracked. A figure stepped out of the void.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a cold expression and an air of nobility.</p><p>His body was also surrounded by a divine ring.</p><p>Everyone gasped. Another true Emperor had appeared.</p><p>“Greetings, patriarch!”</p><p>The martial sovereign from the WAN family bowed respectfully when he saw the man.</p><p>This person was the WAN family’s true Emperor.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>A terrifying screech was heard. Following that, everyone saw a golden light flying over from the distance. As the golden light flew past, the space actually rippled like water, and a hideous opening appeared.</p><p>Then, the golden light faded and a huge three-legged golden Crow appeared in the sky. Its sharp eyes scanned the surroundings, sending chills down everyone’s spine.</p><p>True Emperor, another true Emperor, the true Emperor of the three-legged golden Crow race.</p><p>In ancient Moon Holy Land, true Emperor level experts would not appear unless something important happened. They would either cultivate in seclusion or travel to find ways to increase their strength to resist the Tribulation that occurred once every three hundred thousand years.</p><p>However, because of Lu Ming, true emperors appeared one after another today.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others who were close to Lu Ming looked anxious.</p><p>“Lord martial sovereign, what should we do?”</p><p>Martial Emperor! anxious, Feng Ling sent a voice transmission to the Martial Emperor powerhouses of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>it’s difficult. In this situation, it’s not good for Phoenix Palace to interfere. If our true Emperor interferes, I’m afraid it will turn into an all-out war. Therefore, I’m afraid our true Emperor won’t interfere!</p><p>The martial sovereign of Phoenix Palace said.</p><p>His words made Huang Ling even more anxious.</p><p>Would Lu Ming be able to stop the three true emperors with the help of the great evolution elixir formation?</p><p>A true Emperor’s strength wasn’t something a minor Emperor could compare to. If a great emperor didn’t appear, who could compete with them?</p><p>The three true emperors glared at Lu Ming coldly, their eyes glimmering with a cold light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned serious. With a thought, the Dayan elixir furnace shrank rapidly and floated above his head. At the same time, endless light flashed near the mountain of the elixir furnace. Halos appeared and were extremely gorgeous.</p><p>“You want to stop me with a mere formation?”</p><p>The true Emperor of the Sirius tower said coldly. He stepped on the air and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Beams of light shot toward the true Emperor from the Sirius tower. Two beams of silver light shot out of the true Emperor’s eyes. With a slash, the beams of light were all destroyed. The true Emperor from the Sirius tower strode forward without being stopped.</p><p>A true Emperor expert was much stronger than a void Emperor.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and controlled the great evolution elixir formation with all his might. At the same time, the great evolution elixir furnace shook and resonated with the great evolution elixir formation. In the sky, an extremely huge elixir furnace was formed. It emitted a brilliant light and blasted towards the true Emperor of the Sirius tower.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The true Emperor of the Sirius tower let out a long howl and struck out with his Wolf Claw.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Wolf’s claw hit the pill furnace, but the pill furnace didn’t shatter. It had blocked the true Emperor’s attack.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The true Emperor’s eyes turned cold when he saw that his attack didn’t shatter the pill furnace. He clawed out again.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the pill furnace with all his might and blasted it at the true Emperor from the Sirius tower.</p><p>This elixir furnace combined all the power of the great Yan elixir furnace and the great Yan elixir formation. Its power was extremely terrifying. Previously, it had almost suppressed three martial sovereigns and finally obliterated a demon sovereign.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The true Emperor from the Sirius tower struck the pill furnace again. The pill furnace shook, but it still didn’t shatter. It had blocked the attack..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
