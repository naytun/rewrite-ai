Although they can kill people in the absolute Saint upper tier, they’re definitely no match for an absolute Saint at the peak. Furthermore, there’s an absolute Saint in the great circle. There won’t be any accidents!</p><p>Hamilton shook his head, trying to get rid of the bad thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“That young man and woman are finished!”</p><p>now that the HA family is powerful and dominates barren city, this young man and woman dare to provoke them. The result is already decided!</p><p>“That woman is going to be miserable. She’s beautiful like a flower and the moon, but she’s going to be defiled by hamerty!”</p><p>In the distance, many people sighed.</p><p>During this time, the HA family was domineering, dominating barren city. Many people had suffered, but they didn’t dare to say anything. At this moment, they just stood far away and talked in low voices.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a painting scroll flew out. It was the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>From the mountain and river diagram, a tall and burly figure stepped out.</p><p>Seeing this figure, hammerty’s pupils contracted sharply, and his eyes were filled with fear. He roared,” “Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The one that came out of the mountain and river diagram was naturally Huang Xu. When hammerty had entered the savage barren ancient region, he had seen people from the desolate race. At this moment, he recognized Huang Xu as the person who had attacked them in the savage barren ancient region.</p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Huang Xu punched out a few times, and the terrifying fist force broke through the air as if it could crush everything. The terrifying pressure made the three absolute Saints at the peak and one in the perfected absolute Saint realm turn pale. They retreated frantically, wanting to escape.</p><p>However, how could they escape from a martial Supreme?</p><p>The fist radiance broke through the void and crushed over. The four experts didn’t even have time to scream before their bodies exploded and turned into ashes under the destructive power.</p><p>Hamilton was almost scared to death.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>run! hamerte roared as if he had gone mad. He ordered the remaining absolute Saint in the Great Perfection stage to escape with him.</p><p>However, a giant hand reached out from the ruins and grabbed in the air. A giant palm appeared out of thin air and grabbed hammerty and the absolute Saint. A terrifying force surged in, and the two of them were crippled at the same time.</p><p>Hammerte let out a shrill scream.</p><p>&Nbsp; everyone around was flabbergasted, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p>Two absolute Saints in the great circle and three at the peak of the absolute Saint realm were a powerful force, but they were crushed like ants by Huang Xu.</p><p>Martial Emperor! This is a Martial Emperor!</p><p>“Who is that young man and woman? He actually has a martial sovereign behind him.”</p><p>he must be a heaven’s favorite from a powerful force outside barren city. No wonder he was so calm. He has a martial sovereign with him!</p><p>More people’s eyes lit up. Would the appearance of a martial sovereign change the current situation in barren city?</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside hamoti. His Saint energy was like a blade as he slashed out, killing the absolute Saint in perfection.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me …”</p><p>Hamilton almost peed in his pants as he let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed Hamilton by the neck and said,” “Let’s go to the HA family!”</p><p>Then, he walked toward the HA family.</p><p>Qiu Yue and Huang Xu followed.</p><p>“I’m going to the HA family. There’s going to be a good show!”</p><p>I wonder if Emperor Wu will make a move on the HA clan. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>The others in the distance were looking forward to it, hoping that the martial sovereign would attack the HA family. If the HA family could be destroyed, the situation in barren city would change again, and the cards would be reshuffled.</p><p>This place was not far from the HA family. Not long after, they arrived in front of the HA family mansion.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, come out and die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His voice rumbled and echoed throughout the entire ha family mansion.</p><p>“Who’s looking for death!”</p><p>A loud roar came from the HA family’s residence. Following that, a terrifying aura burst out. A rainbow light flashed, and Ha Zheng’s figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you? Mosi…”</p><p>Ha Zheng’s gaze swept across the room. When he saw Lu Ming, a cold killing intent burst out from his eyes. Then, he saw hamerty in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Brat, quickly release Mosi. Otherwise, I’ll tear you into a thousand pieces …”</p><p>Ha Zheng roared, but he stopped abruptly as if something was stuck in his throat.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the ruins behind Lu Ming.</p><p>He hadn’t noticed the ruins earlier, but now that he saw them, his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, ha Zheng turned around and ran away, not caring about hammerty at all.</p><p>“You want to escape in front of me?”</p><p>Huang Xu’s cold voice was heard as he took a step forward. Then, above the HA family mansion, a huge foot formed, like the foot of a God, covering the entire ha family.</p><p>Ha Zheng was like a small boat in a storm, about to be destroyed at any moment.</p><p>die! he roared. The river of laws surrounded him, and he exploded with all his power, trying to rush out of the range of the giant foot.</p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p>The giant foot stomped down, and Ha Zheng let out a blood-curdling screech. His body shattered into pieces before turning into ashes and dissipating into the air.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be died just like that.</p><p>Martial sovereigns were too powerful. Anyone below the martial sovereign realm was like an ant in front of a martial sovereign. They could not even contend against a martial sovereign, not even an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>After killing ha Zheng, the giant foot did not stop and continued to stomp.</p><p>Beams of light rushed out of the HA family mansion, trying to escape. However, under the giant foot, it was all wishful thinking.</p><p>One figure after another exploded in the air and died on the spot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the giant foot stepped into the HA clan’s mansion, the vast mansion exploded and turned into dust. The entire ha clan was erased from the world.</p><p>alright, this way, no one will know the entrance to the ancient Savage barren realm!</p><p>Huang Xu smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, while Qiu Yue’s eyes flashed with a hint of pity.</p><p>It was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations that the entire ha family would be wiped out in one move.</p><p>Originally, he thought that the ruins would only kill some of the higher-ups of ha family. He didn’t expect that the ruins would be more direct and obliterate the entire ha family in one move.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>The world of martial Dao was a cruel world where the strong preyed on the weak. There might be many innocent people here, but in the eyes of the ruins, he didn’t care.</p><p>Perhaps in his eyes, ordinary people were just like ants.</p><p>If not for his talent, which earned him the attention of the desolate race, and also helped them greatly, he might have been an ant in the eyes of the desolate ruins.</p><p>In such a world, Lu Ming could only make himself stronger so that he would not be treated as an ant by others and be destroyed at will.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart and turned to leave.</p><p>On this day, the Overlord of barren city, the HA family, was exterminated!</p><p>On this day, it was rumored that hamerty had offended a peerless heaven’s favorite who shouldn’t have been offended. This person had descended with a martial sovereign and wiped out the HA family with a flip of his hand!</p><p>On this day, the situation in barren city changed greatly, and heroes fought for supremacy!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
