The leaders of the other forces naturally did not dare to touch Lu Ming and the rest, you want to enter the ancient Savage barren realm? ”</p><p>...</p><p>Ha Zheng asked with a dark expression.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>If he had not heard the news from the ancient wilderness realm, Lu Ming would have asked bubbles to open a space-time Tunnel and leave.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 let you in. Let Murti go now!”</p><p>Ha Zheng said, a sharp glint in his eyes.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming released hammerty, he would tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>“Hehe, do you think I’m stupid? I’ll let him go after I enter the ancient Savage barren realm. If I let him go now, 1’11 be seeking my own death!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>the ancient Savage barren realm isn’t a place you can enter as you wish. The best time is in a month’s time. We can’t enter now! ha Zheng said with a dark expression.</p><p>“Then 1’11 wait for a month. After a month, I’ll come back to find you!”</p><p>Lu Ming carried hammerty and retreated with Qiu Yue at high speed, disappearing from the place in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Ha Zheng did not dare to chase after him.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, then we’ll meet again in a month!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan said. Then, his figure disappeared from the place.</p><p>Following that, the other leaders of the other forces also left.</p><p>Ha Zheng snorted coldly and returned to the HA family mansion. The news that ha Zheng knew about the savage barren realm spread like a whirlwind throughout barren city, causing a huge uproar.</p><p>Countless people were looking forward to the arrival of the next month.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had already left barren city and arrived at a remote place. They placed Hamilton inside the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>He and Qiu Yue found a random place and went into closed-door cultivation. They would wait for a month.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time, and a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On this day, there was a sea of people outside the HA family mansion.</p><p>“The mo clan is here!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>From afar, a group of people flew over. There were hundreds of them. Mo Qingshan took the lead, and behind him were the experts of the mo family. There were more than ten absolute Saints.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The mo clan’s tyrannical arrival caused many people to back off, leaving a large area for them.</p><p>But no one dared to voice their anger.</p><p>The mo family was one of the seven most powerful forces in barren city. No one could compete with them.</p><p>After the mo family, the other five Forces also arrived one by one. Each force had a large number of experts.</p><p>“Where’s Ha Zheng?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s eyes were fixed on the depths of the HA clan’s mansion, and his voice spread far and wide.</p><p>“Don’t worry, 1 won’t leave!”</p><p>From the depths of the HA family mansion, ha Zheng stepped out.</p><p>“A month has passed. Ha Zheng, let’s go!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan said.</p><p>“There’s no hurry, someone hasn’t arrived yet!”</p><p>Ha Zheng said.</p><p>Everyone knew that ha Zheng was referring to Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, figures flashed over from the distance. They were Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Brat, where’s my son?”</p><p>Ha Zheng looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. Hammer suggested that it should be in Lu Ming’s hands, don’t worry. I’ll let him go once we enter the ancient Savage barren realm!</p><p>Ha Zheng was relieved to see that Hamilton was fine. He said,”Alright, let’s go!” wait a minute. 1 think that there are too many people here. Some random people don’t even have the right to enter the ancient Savage barren realm!</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s eyes were like swords as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>that’s right. The seven of us will be enough to enter the ancient Savage barren realm. All other people, get lost!</p><p>The pang family head said.</p><p>“What? You want us to leave? you’re too overbearing!”</p><p>that’s right. In the ancient Savage barren realm, anyone who hears of it will have a share. You’ll only anger the masses. There are so many of us here, so we don’t have to be afraid of you!</p><p>Instantly, the scene became noisy, and many people cried out in dissatisfaction.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying sword light bloomed from mo Qingshan’s hand and shot into the crowd. Screams rang out as more than ten experts were killed by the sword light.</p><p>The crowd was shocked and retreated frantically, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>“Whoever follows will end up like this!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>The powerhouses from the other forces also looked around with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>The others ‘expressions were ugly, but they didn’t dare to voice their anger.</p><p>The difference in strength was too great, and talking too much would only lead to death.</p><p>“We can go now!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s gaze swept towards ha Zheng.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ha Zheng nodded and stepped forward.</p><p>“Ha Zheng, you’re the only one from your ha clan who’s going?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan asked.</p><p>“I alone am enough!”</p><p>Ha Zheng had his hands behind his back, looking like a powerful expert.</p><p>Mo Qingshan and the other Masters of the other forces had looks of suspicion in their eyes, but they did not say anything.</p><p>The powerhouses from the six major forces, Lu Ming, and Qiuyue left barren city with ha Zheng.</p><p>The others didn’t dare to follow and could only watch.</p><p>After flying for an hour, they stopped at a calm lake.</p><p>“The entrance to the ancient Savage barren realm is here?”</p><p>Mo Qingshan asked doubtfully.</p><p>it’s just not time yet. 1 spent thousands of years before 1 found some clues in an ancient book. Just wait!</p><p>After ha Zheng finished speaking, he stood above the lake and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>The others could only wait in silence.</p><p>Soon, the sun set, and the afterglow shone on the earth.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The calm surface of the lake suddenly became choppy, and all kinds of fish jumped on the surface of the lake.</p><p>“Go to the bottom of the lake!”</p><p>Ha Zheng shouted and rushed to the bottom of the lake. The others quickly followed.</p><p>As soon as he reached the bottom of the lake, he saw a Black Vortex.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. Was this the entrance to the savage barren ancient realm?</p><p>Ha zhengzheng was the first to rush into the entrance of the ancient wilderness realm, and the others followed suit.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the crowd and rushed into the entrance.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he was standing on a large grassland.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a boundless grassland. It was vast and majestic, giving off a wild and ancient feeling.</p><p>In the surroundings, ha Zheng and the powerhouses from the other six great factions were present.</p><p>Above their heads, the vortex hung in the air like a Dark Moon.</p><p>Was this the ancient Savage barren realm?</p><p>Many people looked around.</p><p>“Brat, can you give me my son now?”</p><p>Ha Zheng looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s the hurry?”</p><p>Lu Ming carried hammerty and flew away with Qiu Yue.</p><p>“What are you doing? Why aren’t you putting down the Murti?”</p><p>Ha Zheng roared, a hint of anxiety flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“If I let him go now, who knows if you’ll kill me? of course I’ll let him go when we’re far away!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard and he flew further and further away.</p><p>haha, so this is the savage barren ancient realm? let’s go!</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>The other six forces all flew into the distance, as if they were afraid that their treasures would be taken away.</p><p>It was said that the ancient Savage barren realm was full of treasures. They naturally had to make the best use of their time to search for treasures. No one saw the flash of fear and anxiety in ha Zheng’s eyes..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
