She did not expect that the celestial Thearch’s sword that Lu Ming had pulled out in the heavenly Emperor City would be of great use here and save them.</p><p>...</p><p>“Qiuyue, now that I have all the ingredients, why don’t we concoct the soul recovery pill here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Anyway, the materials had been gathered. Lu Ming wanted to refine the soul recovery pill as soon as possible. Moreover, Luo Xiang’s cultivation level had soared and he needed time to consolidate it. He might as well refine the pill here. Anyway, the environment here was more hidden and he was not afraid of being disturbed.</p><p>“Mm, that’s fine too!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and her eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>She also wanted to know what the memory that had been taken from her was.</p><p>When a person knew that a part of her memory had been taken away and was blank, she would still think about it and be curious. This would also cause her obsession and affect her cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out the Dayan elixir furnace and recited the refining method of the soul recovery pill in his heart. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he took out the various materials one by one.</p><p>The soul recovery pill was a very rare and high-level pill. It was also very complicated to refine. It was a slow process that couldn’t be rushed.</p><p>Lu Ming threw the first material into the Dayan elixir furnace and began to temper it.</p><p>When the first material was almost completely tempered, the second material would be put in according to the sequence and the tempering would begin. This would allow the two materials to fuse together in a strange way.</p><p>Of course, he only started with supplementary ingredients.</p><p>Luo Xiang and Qiu Yue sat on both sides of Lu Ming, a few miles away from him. They were cultivating and guarding Lu Ming.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>This time, he used half a month to refine the medicine.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming opened the lid of the furnace and a pill flew out.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He stretched out his hand and sucked the pill into his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look. It was really the soul recovery pill. It was exactly the same as what was recorded in the prescription. He spent half a month and finally succeeded in refining it.</p><p>With a flash, Qiu Yue and Luo Xiang appeared in front of Lu Ming. Qiu Yue looked at the pill in Lu Ming’s hand with anticipation.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, the soul recovery pill is a success. Take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and swallowed the pill without hesitation. She then sat down cross-legged and began to refine it.</p><p>“Let’s hope it works!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists. He was a little nervous.</p><p>The soul recovery pill might not be able to restore Qiu Yue’s memory 100%, and there was a possibility of failure.</p><p>If he failed, it would be difficult to find the materials for the soul recovery pill again.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue had been with him all this time, and it was indeed effective. This would also increase the success rate.</p><p>Lu Ming and Luo Xiang stood at the side and waited. There was a layer of light on Qiu Yue’s body, and the laws of yin and yang were circulating non-stop. She was clearly refining an elixir.</p><p>Three days later, Qiu Yue opened her eyes.</p><p>Has it recovered?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Initially, Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with confusion. Slowly, her eyes regained their liveliness. She looked at Lu Ming and suddenly smiled happily. Her body moved and she pounced toward Lu Ming, throwing herself into his arms.</p><p>“Young master, young master, Qiu Yue has remembered you. Young master, you’ve finally come to look for Qiu Yue …”</p><p>As she spoke, Qiu Yue’s tears flowed down her face and drenched Lu Ming’s clothes.</p><p>“Qiuyue, have you recovered your memories?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Yue kissed Lu Ming’s body a few times, wiping her tears on his clothes. She then blinked her big eyes at Lu Ming and said,”Young master, I’ve recovered. Previously… Please don’t blame Qiuyue for what happened before!”</p><p>She was referring to Qiu Yue’s attitude toward him. When they first met, she even treated Lu Ming as her opponent.</p><p>“Don’t blame me? Of course, you have to blame him. You have to be punished for treating your young master like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately pulled a long face.</p><p>“Then … Then how should we punish him?”</p><p>Qiu Yue asked in a low voice.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>Qiu Yue suddenly stepped forward and gave Lu Ming a Peck on the lips. She then glanced at Luo Xiang who was beside her. Luo Xiang’s eyes immediately darted around and he deliberately looked in other directions as if he could not see anything.</p><p>“This way… Will this work?”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face turned red and her voice became lower and lower.</p><p>“Little girl, I haven’t seen you for a long time and you’re getting more and more daring!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>However, he was also happy. Qiu Yue’s memory had finally recovered. The way she looked at him was exactly the same as ten years ago.</p><p>Qiu Yue stuck out her tongue and made a face.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s return to the yuan mountain sacred Academy!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>young master, I’m afraid we can’t go back yet. After I recovered my memory, 1 felt that my spirit embryo had become bright. It seems that I’m about to break through to the absolute Saint realm. If I miss this time …</p><p>Qiu Yue said softly.</p><p>“He’s about to break through?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed but he was not too surprised.</p><p>Qiu Yue had already reached the great saint realm in the Great Perfection for a long time. She had accumulated enough.</p><p>Now that his memories had been restored, his spirit embryo had become bright, and his thoughts were clear, it was normal for an opportunity to break through to the next level to appear.</p><p>we don’t have anything else to do anyway. Your breakthrough is more important. We’ll be waiting for you here!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>An opportunity to break through could only be encountered and not sought. If he missed this opportunity, he did not know when the next one would come. It would be a waste of time.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded, then flew forward and started cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming and Luo Xiang protected Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue closed her eyes and sank into a deep level of cultivation. She paid no attention to the outside world and focused on breaking through.</p><p>Saint power surged on her body, and the laws of yin and yang surrounded her. Her aura grew stronger with each day.</p><p>Just like that, half a month passed. Qiu Yue’s aura had reached its peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As if something had broken, a powerful aura burst out of Qiu Yue’s body and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Then, Qiu Yue opened her eyes and waved her hand. Large piles of raw gemstones appeared and she started to absorb the raw gemstones ‘raw Qi, as well as the natural Qi in the heaven and earth.</p><p>This process lasted for three days.</p><p>Three days later, Qiu Yue’s aura had reached its peak.</p><p>The aura of an absolute Saint!</p><p>Qiu Yue was the first to become an absolute Saint and reach the lower tier.</p><p>With the talent of the autumn Moon King body, her combat strength would definitely increase sharply after she became an absolute Saint. Even now, Lu Ming was not fully confident that he could defeat Qiu Yue.</p><p>After a while, Qiu Yue finished her cultivation, retracted her aura, and stood up.</p><p>“Qiuyue, congratulations!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and looked at Qiu Yue, feeling rather emotional.</p><p>The little girl who had grown up with him had already become an absolute Saint. She would be a top genius even in the vast Yuan mountain. Who could have expected this?</p><p>“It’s all thanks to young master. Otherwise, 1 wouldn’t have been able to break through so quickly!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the space-breaking shuttle and the three of them entered it. The space-breaking shuttle shot out like lightning and flew towards the nearest teleportation point..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
