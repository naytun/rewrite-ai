Under Lu Ming’s control, it continued to fly toward Luo pokong.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the prison destructive Divine Art and punched continuously with both fists.</p><p>Lu Ming launched a storm of attacks. For a moment, Luo pokong was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Yu Shu and the others were in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had the upper hand and was beginning to suppress Luo pokong. How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was clearly only at the great sage accomplished realm, while Luo pokong’s cultivation was at the great sage accomplished realm.</p><p>With Luo pokong’s talent, it was simply unbelievable that he was at a disadvantage when his cultivation was two levels higher.</p><p>Was the Son of God really that powerful?</p><p>The battle here had long alarmed the only sacred Hall. Many people in the sky were watching and were shocked.</p><p>Luo pokong let out a long howl. He was extremely furious as he exerted all his strength to the extreme.</p><p>Unfortunately, although his penetrating law was powerful, it seemed to have met its nemesis. It could not penetrate Lu Ming’s chaos law.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming muttered. Then, dense runes emerged on Luo pokong’s long spear and covered his entire body.</p><p>The sealed scroll of the nine scrolls of array Dao.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had applied the law of array Dao on each of his holy weapons. As the Holy weapons continued to collide with Luo pokong, the seal Scroll was quietly activated. At this time, it exploded and immediately sealed Luo pokong.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He exerted all his strength and struggled with all his might. A terrifying penetrating power burst forth, hoping to break the seal.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he continued to circulate the divine sword technique. At the same time, he cast the chaotic finger of tribulation and pointed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current mastery of the chaos finger tribulation was close to sixty percent. Its power was shocking. With one finger, mountains and rivers were shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The finger of tribulation of Primal Chaos struck Luo pokong’s body, causing him to let out a blood-curdling screech. His body was sent flying, and he vomited large mouthfuls of blood. He had been severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He continued to step forward and charged towards Luo pokong.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>An old man who had followed Luo pokong here shouted and struck out a huge palm print at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Emperor-to-be!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He had no choice but to retreat with all his might to avoid the palm print.</p><p>you’re just a Supreme Saint. How dare you hurt the sovereign of the Daluo heaven sect? who gave you the guts? I’ll cripple you first!</p><p>At this moment, another elder spoke coldly. He took a step forward and a huge foot formed in the sky, stomping down on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if the space around him had frozen. He could not move his body at all.</p><p>Even a bubble could not break the space and take him away.</p><p>A martial Supreme!</p><p>The old man was a Martial Emperor.</p><p>This was the Daluo heaven sect. It was extremely overbearing. In the territory of the only temple, a Martial Emperor powerhouse wanted to attack Lu Ming directly.</p><p>Just as the foot was about to land on Lu Ming, a wave of energy rippled out like a wave. However, the huge foot dissipated into nothingness under this wave of energy.</p><p>A figure had appeared in the sky without anyone noticing.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Grand Elder!”</p><p>The people from the only divine temple all bowed to this person.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue also bowed to this person.</p><p>The person who had suddenly appeared was Qiu Yue’s master, Bing mu.</p><p>it’s too much for a martial Supreme like you to fight with the younger generation. Since Luo pokong has been defeated, you can leave!</p><p>The ice curtain said indifferently.</p><p>senior ice screen, young master cangqiong has personally asked for this kid. We must take him away today…</p><p>The martial sovereign of the Daluo heaven sect said.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Bing mu suddenly shouted as a terrifying aura pressed down on the Martial Emperor. The Martial Emperor’s expression changed drastically, and he was forced to retreat, almost spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He looked at the ice curtain in fear.</p><p>The ice curtain was definitely a terrifying existence. It had lived for countless years and its cultivation was unfathomable.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to go to the Daluo heaven sect alone. If the great emperor didn’t show up, Luo cangqiong would have been killed.</p><p>The man’s expression changed. He turned around and said,” “Young master Po Kong, let’s go!”</p><p>Luo pokong wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He stared at Lu Ming coldly and said,”Lu Ming, my brother Luo cangqiong is exploring an ancient ruin. When he returns, it will be the time of your death. No one can save you!”</p><p>After saying that, he looked at the ice screen.</p><p>In other words, if Luo cangqiong returned and wanted to lull Lu Ming, the ice curtain would not be able to protect him.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s grandfather was a great emperor.</p><p>He was not Luo cangqiong’s brother, so he was not as tough as Luo cangqiong.</p><p>After saying that, Luo pokong and the people of the Daluo heaven sect stepped into the air and left.</p><p>this kid is so lucky. He’s still fine even after this!</p><p>Yu Shu was filled with hatred.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt someone looking at him. It was the gaze of the ice curtain.</p><p>“I hope there won’t be a next time!”</p><p>The ice curtain opened its mouth. Its voice was very calm, but it made Yu Shu’s face turn pale in an instant, and cold sweat flowed down his face.</p><p>Obviously, he had informed the Daluo heaven sect about Lu Ming and Qiu Yue, and the ice curtain had already known.</p><p>His body trembled, and he didn’t dare to say a word.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept coldly toward Yu Shu.</p><p>It was not difficult to guess from the ice curtain’s words that Yu Shu was the one who told them the secret. Otherwise, how would the people of Daluo heaven sect know that Lu Ming was in the sole divine temple?</p><p>“Lu Ming, Qiuyue, come with me!”</p><p>The ice screen turned around and left. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue followed closely behind and arrived at the palace where the ice screen was staying.</p><p>Lu Ming, you and Qiu Yue should leave the ancient sun sacred land and go to other places. It might help Qiu Yue recover her memory!</p><p>Ice screen said.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong may not be able to kill me!”</p><p>Said Lu Ming. He knew the meaning of the ice curtain. It was for him to avoid Luo cangqiong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you may be powerful, but don’t underestimate the heroes of the world. Luo cangqiong is a terrifying person. His spirit body and laws are top-notch, and he has long reached the absolute Saint realm. You’re not his match now!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong relies on the fact that his grandfather is a great emperor and that his grandfather is extremely protective of his own people. That’s why this person is lawless. Even if you are in the only sacred temple or the shenyuan Empire, you won’t be safe. It’s better to avoid him for the time being!</p><p>also, I know of an ancient prescription called the soul recovery pill. It can help with the recovery of memories, but the ingredients required are too rare, especially the three main ingredients. I spent a lot of effort and only found one. Take a look!</p><p>Ice screen took out a Jade tablet and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses.</p><p>This was an ancient medicinal formula that recorded the refining method of the soul recovery pill and the required materials. There were dozens of them.</p><p>Lu Ming had never heard of three of the main materials.</p><p>“I have collected all the supplementary ingredients for the soul recovery pill. I have also collected one of the three main ingredients. They are all here. Take them. If you have the chance to collect the other two ingredients, you can make the soul recovery pill. There is a high chance that Qiu Yue’s memory will be restored!”</p><p>Ice screen took out another storage ring and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and expressed his gratitude to the ice curtain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
