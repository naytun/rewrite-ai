The endless halos around him rushed out and blocked the three Emperor-level powerhouses.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a Crimson light rushed out. It was an elixir furnace, the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace grew to a height of 10000 feet and smashed heavily on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth rumbled as Lu Ming stepped down from the sky and stood on top of the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>“It’s the Dayan elixir furnace!”</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the demon sovereigns of the heavenly Wolf tower, and the demon sovereigns of the Golden Crow race all stared at the DA yan elixir furnace with burning eyes.</p><p>The great Yan elixir furnace, when combined with the great Yan elixir Scripture, could be used to refine elixirs using laws and seize the good fortune of heaven and earth. Such a treasure was a fatal temptation to any force.</p><p>“Hand over the great Yan elixir furnace!”</p><p>The WAN family Martial Emperor shouted and used his Emperor weapon to open a path as he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The heavenly Wolf tower’s demon Thearch and the Golden Crow demon Thearch did not slow down at all. They burst out with terrifying attacks and blasted away several halos in a row, heading for Lu Ming.</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses charged at Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on top of the furnace, his eyes flashing with madness.</p><p>The WAN family, the Sirius tower, the Golden Crow race, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace-these five Forces had bullied him too much.</p><p>From the beginning, Lu Ming and the five major forces were only a competition between the younger generation.</p><p>It was inevitable for the younger generation to die in the competition, but these major forces directly sent out the older generation when the younger generation was no match for them.</p><p>This time, it was even better. An Emperor-level expert had made a move to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Since that was the case, Lu Ming would go all out. Otherwise, he would be treated as a junior who could be toyed with as he pleased.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still as the attacks from the three Emperor-level powerhouses approached him at high speed.</p><p>“Great evolution elixir formation, smelt all things, refine for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. At this moment, the Dayan elixir furnace let out a roar, as if it was resonating with the entire heaven and earth. The entire area burst with brilliant light. Endless halos gathered from all directions and formed an extremely huge elixir furnace, trying to suppress the three Emperor-level experts.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses roared and attacked the alchemy furnace with terrifying attacks.</p><p>“Da yan elixir furnace, open!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. The lid of the Dayan elixir furnace under his feet opened, revealing a dark space. A terrifying suction force erupted from the elixir furnace, as if it wanted to swallow everything in the world into the Dayan elixir furnace and refine them into an elixir.</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses were sucked in by this terrifying suction force, and their bodies could not help but fall into the alchemy furnace.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses ‘expressions changed, and they burst out with world power, struggling madly to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Great evolution elixir formation, suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and controlled the great evolution elixir formation in this area with all his might.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, the Dayan elixir furnace, and the Dayan formation seemed to have merged into one and exploded with a shocking amount of energy.</p><p>If the great Yan elixir furnace was placed outside, without the support of the great Yan elixir formation, Lu Ming would not be able to exert such a powerful force that could affect Emperor-level powerhouses with his current cultivation.</p><p>However, with the help of the great evolution elixir formation, it was a different story. Its power was astonishing, and it seemed to have awakened, erupting with an astonishing gravitational force.</p><p>In the sky, endless halos gathered and turned into a huge alchemy furnace. The flames inside burned fiercely and pressed down on the three Emperor-level powerhouses.</p><p>The three Emperor-level powerhouses roared and resisted with all their might. However, their bodies were still falling bit by bit, and they were about to be sucked into the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The people watching the battle from afar were dumbfounded.</p><p>Their eyes were wide open as they stood there in a daze. The word ‘shock’ could no longer describe their feelings.</p><p>What did Lu Ming want to do? Could it be that he wanted to slaughter the Emperor? He wanted to put three great emperors into the furnace and refine three Emperor pills?</p><p>This simply couldn’t be described as audacious. This courage was even greater than the heavens.</p><p>For a junior, a great sage, to think that he would attempt to slay a Celestial Emperor. Regardless of whether he would succeed or not, it was definitely insane for him to have such thoughts and actions.</p><p>Martial Emperor, even the weakest minor Emperor, was still a Martial Emperor. He had the power to destroy the world, had an endless lifespan, and could condense a small world. Such a figure, no matter where he was, would be high and mighty, looking down on all living beings.</p><p>When an ordinary person faced an Emperor-level powerhouse, it was like a mortal facing a God. They would not even dare to have the thought of blasphemy. Now, Lu Ming wanted to kill an Emperor.</p><p>One could imagine how shocked the people around them were.</p><p>The most important thing was that the three great emperors were really falling into the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll burn your bones and scatter your ashes!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign roared madly.</p><p>He had really gone mad. Even as a Martial Emperor, he could not take down Lu Ming and needed the help of others. But now, he had even fallen into the hands of little Feng.</p><p>In the future, his reputation as a Martial Emperor was destined to be ruined.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the extreme!</p><p>He hated Lu Ming for resisting. Why did he not follow him to the WAN family and give up everything obediently?</p><p>A mere ant actually dared to resist him, causing him to lose face.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>The WAN clan martial sovereign’s eyes flashed with pain. With a roar, a sovereign weapon rushed up and exploded with a brilliant light.</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign was forced to self-destruct his sovereign weapon.</p><p>The self-destruction of the sovereign weapon was shockingly powerful. The elixir furnace formed by the great Yan elixir formation was torn apart by the terrifying energy, and the WAN clan Martial Emperor rushed out through the gap with the other two sovereign weapons as protection.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The Golden Crow let out a long cry as the Golden Crow demon sovereign flapped his wings. With an astonishing speed, he followed closely behind the WAN clan’s martial sovereign like a ray of golden light and rushed out of the gap.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower also wanted to rush out.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and controlled the great evolution elixir formation. The elixir furnace recovered rapidly and the gap shrank rapidly.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The heavenly Wolf tower’s demon Thearch let out a loud roar and heavily struck the opening. Unfortunately, the opening had already disappeared. The huge alchemy furnace emitted a terrifying flame and pressed down on the heavenly Wolf tower’s demon Thearch.</p><p>At this moment, he was the only one left, so it was even more difficult for him to resist. He was directly crushed by the huge elixir furnace and fell towards the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The demon Thearch of the Skywolf tower struggled madly. The power of the world burst out, and his body expanded rapidly, but it was all useless. It didn’t have much effect.</p><p>His body quickly fell into the pill furnace. Finally, his huge body entered the pill furnace.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the lid of the Dayan elixir furnace and closed it.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he stood on the furnace, his long hair flying in the wind.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the bottom of the pill furnace, the pill fire gushed out.</p><p>At the same time, the great Yan elixir formation turned into rays of light that surrounded the great Yan elixir furnace and suppressed it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying roar came from the great Yan elixir furnace. Obviously, it was the demon Emperor of the heavenly Wolf tower who was bombarding the great Yan elixir furnace. However, it was useless. The great Yan elixir furnace was the sect’s most precious treasure of the great Yan elixir Palace. It could refine the heavens and transform the earth. No one knew what kind of existence had made it, so it could not be broken..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
