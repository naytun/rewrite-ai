This speed shocked the few elders of the desolate race, as well as Huang Li and company.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, he was overjoyed. Perhaps, Lu Ming could really do it?</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed finally slowed down after three hundred steps.</p><p>However, it was still much faster than before.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had taken four hundred steps. After four hundred steps, his speed slowed down a little and then it was five hundred steps.</p><p>After 500 steps, he still did not stop Lu Ming. He took one step at a time, firmly advancing forward. When Lu Ming took 600 steps, the desolate race members were shocked.</p><p>Six hundred steps.</p><p>Previously, desolate li was only able to take 600 steps. Desolate li was the number one elite of the desolate race. In the history of the desolate race, he was also one of the top elites.</p><p>However, the desolate power had taken a few days while Lu Ming had only taken about an hour.</p><p>In the history of the desolate race, the highest record was 700 steps.</p><p>Lu Ming stood at the position of six hundred steps. He adjusted his breathing for a while and took another step.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>There was a violent explosion and a terrifying pressure pressed on Lu Ming’s body. However, Lu Ming’s body only trembled slightly and he resisted the pressure.</p><p>Then, he took a second step, a third step …</p><p>Everyone heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Ming advanced step by step at a constant speed. This time, Lu Ming took an hour to take his 700th step.</p><p>This had already tied with the desolate race’s historical record. Next, Lu Ming only needed to take one more step and he would break the desolate race’s record.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and took some time to regulate his breathing and recover. Then, he took another step forward.</p><p>701 steps. With this step, the earth let out a violent roar, and the entire ancient road emitted a green light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by the Laws of Chaos, resisting the strong pressure from the outside world.</p><p>what a strong pressure. It’s only the 701st step, and the pressure is already so strong!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>He felt that all his muscles and bones were under a terrifying pressure, and they were groaning.</p><p>It was as if his body had become thousands of times heavier.</p><p>In his dantian, the two Saint hearts were spinning rapidly, and the majestic Saint power filled Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward.</p><p>However, at this point, Lu Ming’s walking speed had greatly reduced. It was much slower than before.</p><p>Everyone from the desolate race revealed nervous expressions.</p><p>Was it so difficult after seven hundred steps?</p><p>Could Lu Ming make it to the end? If even Lu Ming could not make it to the end, they would really be in despair.</p><p>They did not believe that anyone of the same level could be stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The rumbles continued. Fortunately, this area was isolated by a formation. Otherwise, the violent rumbles would have shaken the entire ancient city.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming took a total of three hours before he took the hundredth step and landed on the eight hundredth step.</p><p>There were only two hundred steps left before he would be able to walk through this ancient bluestone road.</p><p>But without a doubt, the last two hundred steps would be the most difficult.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned serious. He sat down cross-legged at the 800th step and took out a large number of raw gemstones to devour to recover.</p><p>Just now, he had consumed a large amount of Saint power.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>After a few hours, Lu Ming finally recovered to his peak. He then stood up and stepped out without hesitation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently when he took that step. He felt a force as strong as a storm crashing into his body, as if it was going to break him apart. “What a terrifying pressure!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>The bone armor in his body creaked as it endured the terrifying pressure. It was as if it was going to blow Lu Ming away.</p><p>“How can this pressure stop me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He growled and continued to step forward, resisting this terrifying force.</p><p>After the second step, Lu Ming’s body still trembled. The desolate race members ‘hearts also trembled.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming’s every step was stepping on their hearts.</p><p>After Lu Ming took his second step, he stopped for a long time before taking his third step.</p><p>The pressure from the outside world was really too strong here. If it were an ordinary great sage in the great mastery realm who came here, his body would have been crushed in an instant, leaving no corpse.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming’s pace became very, very slow. With every step he took, he had to stop for a long time to devour raw gemstones to recover.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s posture was still straight and his eyes were still determined.</p><p>Although it was very slow, it was still moving forward!</p><p>This process lasted for five days.</p><p>Five days later, Lu Ming took the 900th step.</p><p>There were still a hundred steps to go.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to sit cross-legged and began to recover.</p><p>This recovery took three days.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming stood up. Everyone in the desolate race felt their hearts in their throats.</p><p>Could Lu Ming continue to move forward?</p><p>He wouldn’t be blasted down when he took his 901st step, right?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming took a step out.</p><p>The ground shook and Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. His face turned pale.</p><p>what a terrifying pressure. It’s even stronger than the previous pressure. Furthermore, there’s even pressure on the soul and even the laws!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>After nine hundred steps, the pressure he had to face was all-round. It was simply too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was almost blasted away. In the end, he gritted his teeth and endured it.</p><p>“He withstood it!”</p><p>The desolate race members were overjoyed.</p><p>On this ancient road, every hundred steps was a Ridge, and the pressure would rise to a new level.</p><p>Therefore, the first step of every hundred steps was the most difficult. Once one couldn’t block it, they would be directly blown down.</p><p>Once the first step was blocked, it meant that he could withstand the power of this level. Then, he could continue to move forward.</p><p>If Lu Ming could take the 901st step, there was a high possibility that he would be able to walk through the ancient bluestone road.</p><p>How could they not be happy?</p><p>However, since ancient times, no one had been able to walk past nine hundred steps. They did not know what the situation would be like after nine hundred steps. Therefore, they were still extremely nervous, afraid that something would happen.</p><p>After taking this step, Lu Ming stood there for a long time before he took another step.</p><p>When he took his second step, Lu Ming’s body still trembled, but he managed to withstand it and stayed there to regulate his breathing.</p><p>After some time, Lu Ming took the third step …</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming would take a step every once in a while. When he had taken 950 steps, he suddenly sat cross-legged and took out a large number of raw gemstones.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“He’s about to break through!”</p><p>An elder asked in surprise.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming was about to break through at this moment..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
