Let’s go into the mountain and river diagram to heal!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Huang Ling.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re alone. You can’t fight them head-on!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling worriedly. She was afraid that Lu Ming would go against Wan Zhengyang and the rest by himself.</p><p>don’t worry. If I can’t defeat them, I’ll have no worries about retreating with bubbles around!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Huang Ling was relieved and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Today, all of you will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming exuded a terrifying killing intent. His cold eyes swept over Wan Zhengyang, Falcon, and the rest.</p><p>“Hehe, do you think this is the great Yan elixir Palace? You’re the one who’s going to die, kill!”</p><p>The Falcon let out a long cry and flapped its wings, pouncing towards Lu Ming. Its wings were like blades as it whizzed out, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Falcon, the number one genius of the celestial Bird Palace, was a great saint in the great circle. His attack was terrifying. If Lu Ming’s spirit body hadn’t evolved, he might not have been able to defeat Falcon. But now, Lu Ming was not afraid.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos circulated and the prison-suppressing heavenly art burst forth. With a palm strike, a Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. Lu Ming seemed to be carrying the prison-suppressing stele as he charged at the Falcon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with the Falcon’s Wings. The Falcon’s body shook violently and it retreated rapidly, its feathers flying in the air.</p><p>His eyes were filled with extreme shock at Lu Ming’s power.</p><p>From the attack just now, he felt a terrifying power surging from Lu Ming’s palm as if he wanted to suppress him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at the great sage initial mastery. How could he have such terrifying power?</p><p>He was standing in the great sage accomplished realm, while Lu Ming was only in the great sage minor mastery. He had just entered the great sage realm. There was such a huge difference in cultivation. In a head-on collision, he was actually no match for him. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the void and charged towards the Falcon.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Falcon roared.</p><p>At once, the wolf howled and the wings flapped in the air. The experts from the Sirius tower and the celestial Bird Palace all charged at Lu Ming. At the same time, Wan Zhengyang led the WAN family’s experts at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Bubbles, you block the people from the WAN family first!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>let’s go! bubbles flew out and waved her hand. Space rippled like water, blocking the path of Wan Zhengyang and the others. At the same time, a terrifying power of time and space surged towards them.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang and the others could only resist with all their might.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, an absolute holy weapon combat sword appeared in his hand. He rushed forward and slashed with the combat sword.</p><p>A terrifying power poured into the sword, making it have the power to split a mountain. It slashed at a giant wolf.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant wolf howled and exploded with all its might. Divine light emanated from its body as it charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>This giant wolf was also a heaven’s pride expert of the Skywolf tower. Although he wasn’t the number one heaven’s pride expert of the Skywolf tower, he was still one of the top few. He was very powerful.</p><p>However, he could not block Lu Ming’s sword at this moment.</p><p>The sword slashed down, breaking his attack and slashing down at his head.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The giant wolf howled, and the next moment, the sword slashed down. Blood gushed out, and the giant wolf was cut in half.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming swung his battle sword horizontally. A powerful bird was killed in one stroke, its feathers flying in the air.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The others trembled in their hearts. Lu Ming’s realm was only great sage minor mastery, but his combat strength was terrifying. This time, the weakest of the three major forces was at the peak of great sage, but they could not block Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to use the divine sword technique. At the same time, he stepped into the air and activated the array Dao law. Dense runes appeared out of thin air and covered the remaining experts.</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword aura was like a rainbow, slashing continuously.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two more experts were killed, and blood stained the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. The Falcon had found an opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Its terrifying sharp claws swiped at Lu Ming. A layer of black light covered the sharp claws.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and it hit the sharp claw. The sword hummed and the Eagle was sent flying again. Blood seeped out of the Eagle’s claws.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his fingers several times in succession. A few huge fingers were pointed at Falcon and the remaining experts.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming’s mastery of the chaotic finger of tribulation had steadily increased. It had already reached 55%.</p><p>The power of the chaotic tribulation finger at 55% was terrifying. It was comparable to 75% of a supernormal technique. Only absolute Saints could reach this realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger crushed down. Apart from Falcon, all the other experts were instantly killed, their bodies exploding under the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>The Falcon also spat out a large mouthful of blood, its feathers flying in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming put away his combat sword and stepped forward. Like a fleeting shadow, he appeared in front of the Falcon in an instant and struck down with his palm.</p><p>The Falcon let out a long cry and fought back with all its might.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The two of them continued to collide with each other and exchanged more than a dozen moves in an instant. After each collision, Falcon retreated frantically.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation was far behind Falcon’s, Lu Ming’s current spirit body had already reached the peak of a superior-grade heavenly spirit body. Moreover, Lu Ming’s spirit body had also refined a wisp of chaotic Qi. The strength of his spirit body was far above that of a superior-grade heavenly spirit body.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cultivated the Laws of Chaos, one of the ten most powerful laws in the world, the Emperor of thousands of laws.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had two Saint hearts. The cultivation of his Saint energy could not be measured with common sense. Although Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the great saint lower tier, the strength of his Saint energy would not be weaker than that of the great saint upper tier because he had two Saint hearts.</p><p>With so many factors added together, Lu Ming was able to cross such a huge distance and overpower the Falcon.</p><p>This Falcon was a top genius. If he was an ordinary person, even an absolute Saint, Lu Ming would be able to fight him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After more than a dozen collisions, the Falcon crashed into the wall of the valley. Flames flew, gravel flew, and feathers flew. The Falcon coughed up blood.</p><p>“Wan Zhengyang, come and help me!”</p><p>Falcon roared. His heart was trembling as he felt a fatal crisis.</p><p>But at this moment, Wan Zhengyang’s face was also pale from fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. Ordinary great saints were as vulnerable as babies in Lu Ming’s hands. Even the Falcon was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had far exceeded his expectations. At that moment, he would not help the Falcon. He only wanted to escape.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>A crazed look flashed across Wan Zhengyang’s face as he self-destructed an absolute Saint weapon. The terrifying power destroyed the spatial defense that bubbles had set up, and he and a few experts of the WAN family broke through bubbles ‘defense.</p><p>However, they didn’t go to help the Falcon. Instead, they soared into the sky and fled into the distance.</p><p>“Falcon, you block them first. I’ll find an expert to save you!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s voice came from afar.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Falcon roared, revealing a look of despair.</p><p>“It seems that no one will come to save you. Die, seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He clenched his fist in the air and dense runes emerged from the Falcon’s body. They formed a terrifying sealing force that was about to seal the Falcon..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
