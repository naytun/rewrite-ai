He waved his hand and a map appeared in the sky.</p><p>At the three corners of the map, there were three dots of light, representing the military camps of three parties.</p><p>Their current location was quite a distance away from their own military camp.</p><p>I believe that it won’t be long before Ouyang wudao sends his Army to occupy our camp. This way, Ouyang wudao will have the absolute advantage. Even if this stalemate continues, Ouyang wudao will still obtain victory!</p><p>however, this is not what Ouyang Wuji wants to see. If he wants to fight against Ouyang wudao, he has to achieve a certain level of success. Therefore, Ouyang Wuji will not give up on our military camp. If he can obtain one, he will definitely get a high score!</p><p>Lu Ming explained and everyone listened carefully.</p><p>however, with Ouyang wudao’s overbearing character, how could he hand over the fat meat that’s already in his mouth? now that we’re no longer a threat to him, we’re just struggling at death’s door in their eyes. Therefore, in the end, they’ll definitely launch a decisive battle in our camp. We’ll then be able to reap the benefits without doing anything. When they’re both injured, we can annihilate them in one fell swoop!</p><p>Lu Ming explained the complete plan.</p><p>The previous sacrifice of more than 20000 people was to make the other two sides let down their guard against them. This way, the other two sides would have a chance to fight.</p><p>Hmph, all of this is just your conjecture. Your conjecture is perfect, but the truth is cruel!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? Let’s just watch the show. Ninth Prince, just send out Scouts to keep an eye on the situation outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded and sent out Scouts to gather information.</p><p>Indeed, not long after, Ouyang wudao led his Army and occupied their camp.</p><p>ninth brother ran pretty fast, but there are only a few thousand people left. There’s no need to worry. They’re just struggling on their last breaths!</p><p>In the military camp, Ouyang wudao said in disdain.</p><p>The news of the battle between Ouyang Wushuang and Ouyang wudao had also reached Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>In Ouyang Wuji’s military camp, everyone was also in a meeting.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang is really stupid. He actually attacked Ouyang wudao and was annihilated instead. This way, Ouyang wudao gained the upper hand. How hateful!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said unhappily.</p><p>“Sixth Prince, what should we do next?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>now, Ouyang Wushuang only has a few thousand people left. He abandoned the camp and fled, struggling on his last breath. He will definitely be the last one. There’s no need to worry!</p><p>and now, Ouyang wudao has taken over Ouyang Wushuang’s military camp with the battle merits of annihilating his 25000-strong Army. If this continues, the first place will definitely be his. Therefore, we can’t give up on Ouyang Wushuang’s military camp!</p><p>as long as we can seize that military camp, we’ll be able to compete with Ouyang wudao in terms of battle merits. Moreover, we have the advantage in numbers. Only then will we have a chance to defeat Ouyang wudao and obtain first place!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>that’s right. I suggest that we immediately send out our Army and attack Ouyang Wushuang’s camp in one fell swoop!</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the temple nodded.</p><p>Immediately, Ouyang Wuji mobilized almost all of his Army, leaving only a few thousand people to guard the camp. The rest of the Army headed toward Ouyang Wushuang’s camp.</p><p>Not long after, Ouyang Wuji’s Army arrived near the camp.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The sound of war drums reverberated in the military camp. Following that, a purple-colored Army appeared in the air. The person in the lead was Ouyang wudao.</p><p>“Sixth brother, I knew you would come!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao spoke.</p><p>“Oh, really? It’s a pity that you’re only a small part of this Army. As long as I can annihilate you and take this Army, the final victory will be mine!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji sneered as his eyes glowed with a fiery light.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao’s lips curled up. With a wave of his hand, the war drum sounded again.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A roar came from behind Ouyang Wuji’s Army. A White Tiger and a Black Tortoise appeared in the sky.</p><p>Behind Ouyang wudao, the Army had set up a formation. An Azure Dragon and a Phoenix appeared.</p><p>“Four symbols formation, you’ve called everyone here!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right, I’ll annihilate all of your people here! Kill!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao ordered.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji also gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, Ouyang Wuji’s Army set up a formation and a huge Mantis appeared.</p><p>This was the Mantis battle formation. The two front claws of the Mantis were like two heavenly blades, extremely sharp.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Azure Dragon, Black Tortoise, White Tiger, and Phoenix pounced towards the huge Mantis. The huge Mantis waved its front claws as if it could cut through the void.</p><p>The five giant beasts kept colliding with each other.</p><p>Although the four symbols battle formation was powerful, it separated the number of people. Ouyang Wuji’s formation, which consisted of nearly 30000 people, was extremely powerful. It was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>Both sides were trying their best to defeat each other.</p><p>Now, Ouyang Wushuang was not a cause for concern. As long as they could defeat the other, they would gain the upper hand and obtain the first place.</p><p>The two sides were fighting fiercely. Even in the middle of the battle, people were constantly dying, turning into light and disappearing.</p><p>At this time, in a Hidden Valley, 5000 soldiers had gathered and were ready to set out. Meanwhile, the scouts kept sending back news.</p><p>“Report! The first Prince has already taken over our military camp!”</p><p>report! The sixth Prince has sent an Army to attack our camp!</p><p>report! The sixth Prince and the first Prince have started fighting. The battle is brutal!</p><p>As more and more news came, the faces of the geniuses of the purple flame villa became uglier and uglier.</p><p>It was because everything was exactly the same as Lu Ming’s previous speculation.</p><p>“Hmph, even if the first Prince and the sixth Prince attack each other and injure each other, we only have five thousand people left. We don’t have the power to deal with them!”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng said with a sullen face.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming’s speculation was correct, so what? in the end, they still had to rely on their true abilities. There were only five thousand of them. It would be difficult to finish the battle.</p><p>“We’ll know the result soon, so what’s the hurry?”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>Such an expression gave the proud sons of heaven of the purple flame villa a bad feeling.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was really confident that there was something that they did not know?</p><p>Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji’s battle was getting more and more intense. Their eyes were bloodshot as they continued to kill each other’s soldiers.</p><p>The number of people on both sides was about the same. Ouyang wudao had lost about two thousand people previously, while Ouyang Wuji had left a portion of his men in the main camp.</p><p>However, Ouyang wudao’s four symbols formation was indeed stronger. He slowly gained the upper hand. However, even though he gained the upper hand, he could not completely suppress them. The losses on both sides were increasing..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
