Ouyang Moli knew how to repay kindness. He had a good character and was to his liking.</p><p>...</p><p>“Alright, since you insist on taking me as your master, I’ll take you in as my disciple!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>The Scion of Samsara was a rare existence in the world. Since ancient times, there had only been a handful of such prodigies. Lu Ming was also very tempted. He pondered for a moment and then nodded in agreement.</p><p>“However, I will still pass on the inheritance of that senior to you. You must also respect that senior as your master, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>master! Ouyang Moli was overjoyed. I understand. Master!</p><p>“Mm, get up!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed and Ouyang Moli stood up obediently.</p><p>before you, I’ve already taken in two in-name disciples and one true disciple.</p><p>In the future, you’ll be ranked second among the true disciples. Do you understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“Understood, master!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli said respectfully.</p><p>“Hmm, let’s talk about you. Your surname is Ouyang, so you should be a member of the divine Yuan Empire’s royal family. Why did those people treat you like that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Since he had accepted Ouyang Moli as his disciple, he naturally had to understand his situation.</p><p>“Master, although I’m. member of the imperial family, I’m only a branch of the imperial family…”</p><p>Following that, Ouyang Moli began to explain.</p><p>The divine origin Empire’s Ouyang royal family had developed and multiplied for countless years, giving birth to countless branches. Their population was already so large that it was hard to imagine.</p><p>Ouyang Moli was from one of the branches. However, a few years ago, his parents were killed by the Daluo heaven sect while they were cultivating outside. Now, he was the only one left in his branch.</p><p>In the past few years, he had relied on his identity as a descendant of the Ouyang family to obtain a job in the palace. Unfortunately, he had not been able to awaken his bloodline. After so many years of hard work, he had only reached the warrior realm.</p><p>Furthermore, he was all alone, so he was often bullied by others. He had always been patient, hoping that one day he would awaken his bloodline and soar into the sky. At the same time, he would avenge his parents.</p><p>This time, due to his hard work, the higher-ups had rewarded him with a stabilizing pill. He hoped to use this stabilizing pill to awaken his bloodline, but he was surrounded by the yellow-robed youth and the others, who wanted to snatch his stabilizing pill.</p><p>The yellow-robed youth and the others were also from the Ouyang royal family. However, they were able to awaken their bloodline, so their cultivation was naturally far above Ouyang Moli’s.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded silently. Such things happened all the time in the entire Yuan continent.</p><p>Wasn’t he the same back then?</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had discovered him this time. Otherwise, an unparalleled genius would have been buried.</p><p>In fact, this world had never lacked heaven’s favorites. It just depended on whether they could be discovered. Since ancient times, there had been countless heaven’s favorites who had been buried.</p><p>Some physiques and geniuses had been outstanding since young and had displayed rare talents. Naturally, they would not be buried. They would be discovered by important people and focused on training.</p><p>However, there were some physiques and bloodlines that were hidden and could not be developed without a strong support.</p><p>For example, Ouyang Moli’s reincarnation bloodline was hidden. Moreover, he was from a branch of the Ouyang imperial family, so no one paid attention to him. Others would think that he was a good-for-nothing. If he had not met Lu Ming this time and the reincarnation halberd had a reaction, Lu Ming would not have discovered him.</p><p>If this continued, in a few more decades, this peerless genius would be buried.</p><p>Therefore, some powerful forces would send experts to travel the world in search of heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Back then, wasn’t Qiu Yue discovered by the only divine temple’s powerhouse in this way?</p><p>in the future, if I succeed in my cultivation, I will definitely find the Daluo heaven sect and avenge my parents!</p><p>Ouyang Moli clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>then you have to cultivate well. I’ll pass on an inheritance to you first. Sit tight!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Ouyang Moli sat down immediately. Then, Lu Ming took out the world-core of the reincarnation Emperor and sealed it in Ouyang Moli’s sea of consciousness with his powerful cultivation.</p><p>Ouyang Moli’s entire body immediately emitted a black light. A vortex spun non-stop above his head. It was as black as ink, as if it was leading to the abyss of hell.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, the vortex suddenly trembled and split into two.</p><p>After a while, another vortex split out and became three vortexes.</p><p>Every time the vortex split, Ouyang Moli’s aura would increase.</p><p>Just like that, a few hours later, a total of six vortexes appeared above Ouyang Moli’s head.</p><p>“Six paths of reincarnation!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes glistening.</p><p>This was the true six paths reincarnation bloodline.</p><p>Mo Li’s cultivation has already reached the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>Ouyang Moli had only just started to merge with the world core of the reincarnation Emperor, but his cultivation had already increased explosively, reaching the martial King realm.</p><p>After another two hours, Ouyang Moli finally opened his eyes.</p><p>“My cultivation…”</p><p>Ouyang Moli could feel the endless power in his body, and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Mo Li, you’ve just fused with the world core, and your cultivation has skyrocketed. However, you can’t lose yourself. During this time, you’ll stay in my mountain and river diagram and familiarize yourself with your own power. Don’t increase your cultivation for now!</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>It wasn’t a good thing for his cultivation to rise too quickly. He had to stabilize his Foundation.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>okay, you should cultivate well. If you have any problems, you can find me at any time. Also, this reincarnation halberd is for you to use!</p><p>Lu Ming took out the reincarnation halberd and handed it to Ouyang Moli. Naturally, Ouyang Moli was grateful.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, went to the path-understanding ancient tree and quietly studied the chaotic finger of tribulation.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Every once in a while, Lu Ming would go to the array world and watch Ouyang Wushuang train the Army.</p><p>The thirty thousand strong Army was divided into two groups. One group had twenty-five thousand people to continue practicing the sky Tiger roaring formation. The other five thousand people were taken away by Ouyang Wushuang to practice the true dragon battle formation in secret.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two-month training period was up.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the geniuses of the purple flame villa all entered the world of formations.</p><p>They and Ouyang Wushuang were standing on high ground, and below them was the Army of thirty thousand.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Under Ouyang Wushuang’s command, the 30000 strong Army set off and rolled into the distance.</p><p>At the same time, two other armies from two different directions also headed toward the center of the formation world.</p><p>Not long after, the three armies met in the center of the formation world.</p><p>The three armies formed a triangle, facing each other, and no one dared to make a move.</p><p>To the left of Lu Ming’s group was an Army clad in purple armor. At a glance, it looked like a Purple Ocean. It was the Army led by the first Prince, Ouyang wudao.</p><p>On their right was an Army in silver armor. It was the Army led by Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>sixth brother, ninth brother, you’d better surrender. The position of Crown Prince will be mine this time. You can’t compete with me!</p><p>An overbearing voice came from the purple Army..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
