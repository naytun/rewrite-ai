We just need you to approach an altar from here and activate it!”</p><p>...</p><p>A desolate race elder said.</p><p>“Approach the altar? Are there any obstacles on this road?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The clan elder nodded and said,” these three altars were left behind by the desolate race’s ancestors. Legend has it that they contain the desolate race’s Supreme treasures. They are related to the rise and fall of the desolate race. Unfortunately, for countless years, no one has been able to approach the altars and activate them to obtain the desolate race’s Supreme treasures!</p><p>every path is filled with terrifying pressure. The stronger one’s cultivation is, the stronger the pressure will be. That’s why only heaven’s favorites can take this path!</p><p>The elder explained.</p><p>So that was the case. Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It was no wonder the desolate race wanted his help.</p><p>The cage battle earlier was probably a test for him. Otherwise, he would’ve regained his freedom after obtaining 100 victories.</p><p>“Clan elder, I want to try again!”</p><p>Desolate Li said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and try!” The elder nodded.</p><p>Desolate li stepped forward, heading towards the ancient path on the far left.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The moment he stepped onto the ancient Limestone Road, the heavens and earth seemed to rumble. The desolate Power’s step felt as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>Desolate Li’s body trembled slightly. Then, he stood up straight and continued to walk forward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Another explosion sounded out, and the ground trembled slightly. Desolate power seemed to be under great pressure.</p><p>The muscles on his body bulged, and the laws of extreme power covered his entire body. He was like an invincible God of War as he stepped forward.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Step by step, he walked forward. Every step he took would make a loud boom.</p><p>Very quickly, desolate took a hundred steps forward. However, after a hundred steps, his speed began to slow down. It was as if the pressure he was under had become even stronger.</p><p>However, in desolate Li’s eyes, there was determination and determination. He continued to advance.</p><p>Not long after, desolate took 200 steps. His speed slowed down again, but he still continued forward.</p><p>It seemed like every hundred steps he took, the pressure on desolate power would increase.</p><p>He advanced step by step. Every hundred steps, the desolate Power’s speed would slow down.</p><p>After more than an hour, desolate finally took five hundred steps.</p><p>When he took his 501st step, his body suddenly trembled and his face turned pale.</p><p>The ancient bluestone road was a thousand meters long, which meant that it had a thousand steps.</p><p>He had only crossed half of the desolate power threshold.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Desolate li let out a low roar. His eyes were filled with an unyielding look as he continued to walk forward.</p><p>He took a step forward, and his body trembled again.</p><p>However, he did not fall. Instead, he continued to move forward.</p><p>Every step he took was very difficult, as if he was carrying an ancient divine mountain with the weight of millions of Jun.</p><p>that’s right, there’s an improvement. In the history of the desolate race, the number of people who can take 500 steps can be counted on your fingers!</p><p>The clan elder nodded. He was satisfied with desolate’s performance.</p><p>“Let’s see how many steps this little guy can take in the end!”</p><p>Another elder spoke.</p><p>After that, no one said anything and continued to watch.</p><p>The desolate power steps became slower and slower. Sometimes, it would take dozens of minutes to take a single step.</p><p>However, everyone had a lot of patience.</p><p>After three whole days, desolate li had finally taken 600 steps.</p><p>that’s right. To reach 600, even among the Royal physiques in the history of the desolate race, not many have been able to do so!</p><p>A clan elder praised.</p><p>For desolate power to be able to do this, his future achievements would be extraordinary.</p><p>After desolate power took 600 steps, he stopped and stood there, as if he was recovering.</p><p>This stop lasted for an entire day.</p><p>One day later, desolate let out a furious roar and took another step towards the 601st step.</p><p>However, when he took this step, his body trembled violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was thrown back and flew out of the ancient bluestone road.</p><p>A clan elder reached out and caught Huang Li. A wave of energy entered Huang Li’s body, and his pale face regained some vitality.</p><p>Lu Ming, as you can see, with desolate’s strength, he can only take 600 steps. If you can help our tribe activate the altar, you will be our tribe’s great benefactor. As our tribe’s honored guest, you will be given the position of an elder from another tribe. Your position will be second only to us desolate race elders. How about it? ”</p><p>An elder spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart palpitated.</p><p>If they helped the desolate race activate the altar, they could obtain the position of an external elder of the desolate race. Their status would be second only to the desolate race’s elders, and this authority would probably be no trifling matter.</p><p>And the desolate race’s strength was unfathomable. If he could obtain the help of the desolate race, he would definitely be an extremely powerful backer.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly took a deep breath and calmed himself down, senior, you’re being too polite. I’ll definitely do my best. Also, I came to the ancient Savage barren realm to look for Berserker crystals. I wonder if senior has any news about them?”</p><p>“So you’re looking for Berserker crystals. Although Berserker crystals are precious, our tribe still has a lot of them. It’s fine to give you a few later!”</p><p>An elder smiled.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He looked at the ancient bluestone road and said,”Then this junior will go and try!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took a step forward, heading towards the ancient path on the left that desolate force had just taken.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>When Lu Ming took a step in, he felt a strong force pressing down on him, making his body extremely heavy. The ground trembled when he took a step.</p><p>However, although this surge of energy was strong, it did not affect Lu Ming much.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward quickly.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The ground kept shaking. In a few breaths, Lu Ming had crossed a hundred steps.</p><p>what a fast speed. As expected of the son of chaos!</p><p>A desolate race elder’s eyes lit up.</p><p>this child is stronger than the average child of God. Perhaps there’s really hope!</p><p>The other clan elder revealed a hopeful expression.</p><p>The altars left behind by their ancestors had been sealed for far too long. For countless years, they had tried everything they could to open it, but they had never been able to.</p><p>Perhaps, there was hope now.</p><p>Their desolate race, countless years ago, was the most powerful faction in the world. They were at the peak of their strength and experts were as common as clouds. In the end, they fought with other powerful factions, resulting in their defeat and their experts being killed.</p><p>As such, they could only seclude themselves in the world, hiding in the savage barren ancient region. However, no one had ever activated the treasures left behind by their ancestors. After so many years, the desolate race had yet to recover to its former glory.</p><p>The treasures in the three altars were their chance, so they naturally cared about it.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>When Lu Ming took a hundred steps, he did not stop at all. He took the 101st step.</p><p>When he took this step, Lu Ming felt an even stronger force pressing down on him. However, Lu Ming’s muscles only trembled slightly and he resisted this force as he continued to take another step forward.</p><p>The first three hundred steps did not affect Lu Ming much. He moved forward at a constant speed and in just over a minute, he had taken the first three hundred steps..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
