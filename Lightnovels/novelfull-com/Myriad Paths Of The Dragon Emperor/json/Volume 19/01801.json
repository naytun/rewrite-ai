However, the door of light had appeared. It was difficult for him to stop so many people from entering.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the result was unexpected. Wan Zhengyang slammed his head into the light door. He was dizzy from the impact and could not enter. He was blocked.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang bellowed in rage. He then looked at the token in Lu Ming’s palm with a burning gaze.</p><p>“Brat, give me your token!”</p><p>die! Wan Zhengyang shouted. He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. A combat sword appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming, trying to cut off his arm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved. He dodged Wan Zhengyang’s attack like a bolt of lightning and rushed toward the door of light.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Two more young men appeared in front of Lu Ming. They blocked Lu Ming coldly and stretched out their hands to grab him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and threw two consecutive punches.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two young men’s bodies trembled violently as they were sent flying backward and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Laws of Chaos. You’re Lu Ming!”</p><p>One of them shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Stay here!”</p><p>Behind him, Wan Zhengyang’s cold killing intent burst out. Holy weapons flew out of his acupoints. The Qi of battle weapons converged, and a terrifying sword Qi slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand as well. He slashed backward and clashed with Wan Zhengyang’s combat sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a terrifying vibration. Lu Ming’s body used this force to move forward at extreme speed, rushing toward the light door.</p><p>The door of light rippled like water and did not hinder Lu Ming at all. He rushed into the door of light and disappeared.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>die! Wan Zhengyang roared and slashed at the light door with his sword. However, the light door was indestructible and had no reaction at all. The light dimmed and disappeared the next moment.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, the other young men rushed over and asked in surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming. He’s gone in!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang roared. He was extremely unwilling.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming had entered? How can he enter?”</p><p>The others were even more confused.</p><p>“He has the key to open a door of light. Damn it!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang shouted in anger. He then turned to look at Feng Ling with an extremely cold gaze and said,” “Lu Ming has the key. Do you have it? hand it over quickly.”</p><p>“If Lu Ming has it, why would I? What a joke!”</p><p>Huang Ling sneered.</p><p>of course you won’t admit it. I’ll search it myself!</p><p>Wan Zhengyang stepped out and was about to press on Feng Ling.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang was the strongest among the WAN family’s younger generation. He was definitely strong. Huang Ling was no match for him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the entire Furnace Mountain shook violently.</p><p>Then, a beam of light burst out from the mountain and swept in all directions. Anyone who was swept by the light was sent flying out of the mountain.</p><p>The light swept past and all the young men who entered were swept out of the mountain.</p><p>Outside the mountain, countless people stood in the air, looking at the mountain of pill furnaces and waiting.</p><p>In the sky, many Emperor-ranked powerhouses stood there, emitting terrifying fluctuations. It was as if there were dozens of worlds there that were about to devour everything.</p><p>All of a sudden, the pill Furnace Mountain trembled. Then, everyone saw a ray of light burst out. Then, one by one, the young men were rushed out of the mountain at an amazing speed. They only managed to stabilize themselves after they were out of the mountain.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang roared, his anger soaring.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>High up in the sky, the WAN clan’s Emperor-level expert glared at Wan Zhengyang with a sharp gaze.</p><p>Lord martial sovereign, someone has entered the mountain of pill furnaces!</p><p>Wan Zhengyang said.</p><p>When facing a Martial Emperor, even the younger generation would address him as Lord Martial Emperor out of respect.</p><p>“What? Someone had entered the mountain of pill furnaces? Who is it?”</p><p>The eyes of the WAN clan’s martial sovereigns shone with a brilliant light.</p><p>The experts from the other forces were all shocked. They started to look at the heaven’s favorites from their own forces, hoping that it would be their own heaven’s favorites who entered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s voice sounded again.</p><p>These words made many people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming! It was Lu Ming again!</p><p>Not long ago, Lu Ming’s name had caused an uproar in the ancient Moon sanctuary. He was extremely audacious and killed more than a dozen geniuses from the four major factions in the thousand spirit exchange, as well as more than a dozen senior Supreme Saints.</p><p>In the end, the four major forces sent out a large number of experts and even Emperor-level experts to search for him, but it was to no avail. They could not find Lu Ming.</p><p>Some martial Supremes had even heard of Lu Ming.</p><p>Even some of the martial sovereigns were surprised that he had returned to the mountain of pill furnaces without anyone knowing.</p><p>“It’s this kid again. How did he get in? Is he alone?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s Martial Emperor asked.</p><p>Lu Ming has the key and he opened the door…</p><p>Wan Zhengyang briefly explained the situation inside, then looked at Feng Ling and Long Chen, you guys are with Lu Ming. Do you have the key too?”</p><p>“What a joke. If we had the key, why would we be here?”</p><p>Huang Ling sneered.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, the WAN family Martial Emperor finally noticed Feng Ling and Long Chen. He frowned.</p><p>Didn’t he send people to kill Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others? why were they still alive?</p><p>Then, he looked around and found that the WAN family was missing a few heaven’s favorites. He frowned and asked coldly,” “Zhengyang, where are the celestial dynasty and the others? Where did he go?”</p><p>“Where are Dark Wolf and the others of my Skywolf tower? why aren’t they here?”</p><p>“My heavenly Bird Palace …”</p><p>Then, the cultivators of the major forces looked around and said coldly. They all found that some people from their respective sects were missing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The WAN family martial sovereign’s eyes were like lightning as he looked at Feng Ling and asked,” “Tell me, where did my Wan family’s WAN Tianchao and the others go?” what?” Huang Ling’s expression changed, senior, you must be joking. How would I know about your Wan family’s heaven’s favorite?”</p><p>they’re all dead. They’ve been killed by Feng Ling, Long Chen, and Lu Ming!</p><p>At this moment, a loud cry was heard. Everyone looked over and found that it was the fourth prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>“What? He was killed?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial emperors, the Skywolf tower’s martial emperors, and the others burst out with a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. He was killed by them!”</p><p>The fourth golden Crow Prince called out, his eyes flashing with a vicious light.</p><p>how dare you kill the WAN clan’s chosen? you’re courting death!</p><p>The martial sovereign of the WAN clan let out a long roar and took a step forward. This step caused the heaven and earth to shake, as if the world was about to explode. The terrifying and astonishing aura made everyone’s expression change drastically, and they retreated frantically.</p><p>It was the same for Huang Ling. She retreated quickly, but she still felt a strong pressure. Her body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, at this moment, a figure appeared in front of bi Lin. A terrifying aura also burst out and blocked the aura of the WAN family’s Martial Emperor.</p><p>“A martial Supreme is going to attack a junior?”</p><p>This was a Martial Emperor powerhouse from Phoenix Palace. He spoke coldly and glared at the WAN family’s martial emperors..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
