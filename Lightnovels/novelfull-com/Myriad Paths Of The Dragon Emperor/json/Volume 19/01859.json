He might be of great help to our desolate race!</p><p>“You mean that matter? How was that possible? Not even the strongest paragons of our desolate race have been able to complete it, so how can an outsider do it?”</p><p>“How would you know if you don’t try? Let’s report this and see what the patriarchs think.”</p><p>A few desolate race experts were discussing. After that, a person stepped down from the sky and landed in the arena.</p><p>“Senior, now that I’ve won a hundred matches in a row, can I obtain my freedom?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the desolate race expert.</p><p>“We can’t!”</p><p>The desolate race expert shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed, senior, 1 heard that the desolate race has a rule. As long as you win a hundred matches in a row, you can obtain freedom. Are the desolate race going back on their word? ”</p><p>At the scene, the others were also surprised.</p><p>Indeed, as long as they won a hundred rounds, be it slaves, beasts, or anyone else, they would obtain their freedom. This was a rule passed down through the generations of the desolate race.</p><p>Why was the desolate race expert saying that it was not possible?</p><p>that rule only applies to the beings of the ancient Savage barren realm. You are outsiders, so the conditions are even higher. If you can cross realms and win a hundred consecutive victories, you will be free!</p><p>The desolate race expert said.</p><p>cross-level hundred-win streak? okay, I agree!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and returned to the secret room.</p><p>“A hundred-win streak?”</p><p>Everyone in the stands was shocked. Then, they revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>Since ancient times, not many people had been able to achieve a cross-realm hundred-win streak. Those who could achieve it were all peerless heaven’s favorites who later became peerless powerhouses.</p><p>Would this outsider be able to complete it?</p><p>After Lu Ming returned, it was bubbles and Qiu Yue’s turn.</p><p>Without exception, bubbles and Qiu Yue also successfully obtained 100 consecutive wins.</p><p>However, they did not regain their freedom. Instead, they continued to return to the secret chamber.</p><p>In an ancient castle within the desolate race, a group of terrifying experts were discussing matters.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be three terrifying geniuses among the outsiders. One of them has mastered the Laws of Chaos, one has mastered the laws of space and time, and the last one has a King body and is also very strong!</p><p>“Perhaps I can use the help of these outsiders to complete that matter!”</p><p>I’m afraid that’s impossible. In the past generations, there have been no lack of King physiques in our clan, but no one has been able to complete it. The other two are the children of God, so there might be hope!</p><p>that little girl is too young. Although the space-time law is wonderful, it’s not powerful enough. I’m afraid it won’t work either. On the other hand, the young man named Lu Ming has mastered the chaos law. He might have a chance!</p><p>well, then let’s let that young man cross levels and fight. Let’s see what level his combat power has reached before we make a decision!</p><p>The desolate race experts were discussing matters, but Lu Ming was completely unaware.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was a little worried.</p><p>He and bubbles should be able to achieve a hundred consecutive victories if they were to fight across levels unless the other party also had a child of heaven. If not, they would have no problem.</p><p>He was worried about Qiu Yue.</p><p>Although Qiu Yue’s combat strength was very strong, the desolate race was a race that loved to battle. At the same level of combat strength, they were stronger than outsiders. What if the desolate race also had a King physique? Qiu Yue would be in danger.</p><p>Furthermore, Qiu Yue’s cultivation was at the great circle of the Supreme Saint realm. She could fight an absolute Saint?</p><p>The difference between an absolute Saint and a Supreme Saint was huge. This was the difference between a large realm and not something that a small realm could compare to.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh.</p><p>There was no point in worrying now. He could only take one step at a time.</p><p>On the second day, Lu Ming’s cross-level battle began.</p><p>The cage battle arena was even more crowded.</p><p>An outsider was about to engage in a cross-realm battle, which caused a huge uproar and attracted countless people to watch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The earth rumbled. Lu Ming’s first cross-level battle was against a terrifying beast.</p><p>It was a ten-meter-tall bear covered in scales. Its cultivation was at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still only used one move to send the giant bear flying more than ten thousand meters away.</p><p>his combat strength is indeed amazing. Even if his cultivation is one level higher, he can’t even withstand a single blow!</p><p>he’s definitely not Lu Ming’s match in the beginning. We’ll have to wait and see. Later on, there will be geniuses at the peak of the great sage realm. That’s when the battle will be intense!</p><p>Since Lu Ming was able to win a hundred consecutive battles at the same level, he naturally had the ability to fight above his level. Ordinary peak great saints were no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>If they wanted to watch, they would have to watch the battle between Lu Ming and the Supreme Saints at the peak of the great saint realm.</p><p>The crushing continued.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to crush them with a sweeping momentum.</p><p>Ten consecutive wins, twenty consecutive wins …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had achieved 80 consecutive victories.</p><p>Starting from the 8oth consecutive victory, there were a few heaven’s favorites. There were those with the heavenly spiritual body, those with powerful divine arts, and even beasts with terrifying bloodlines.</p><p>However, without any exception, they were all crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>90 consecutive wins, 95 consecutive wins, 99 consecutive wins …</p><p>It was unstoppable!</p><p>In the hundredth battle of the cross-level battle, the desolate race sent out a terrifying beast. This beast’s physique was terrifyingly strong, but it was still easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Cross-level battle, 100 consecutive wins!</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>A hundred-win streak across levels was born. Moreover, it seemed that Lu Ming was very relaxed and did not use much effort.</p><p>How could he be so strong?</p><p>The surrounding spectators were extremely shocked.</p><p>Such experts were rare in the desolate race’s history.</p><p>It was shocking that there was such a genius among the outsiders.</p><p>“Senior, can I regain my freedom?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his head and looked at the desolate race expert in the sky.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The desolate race expert nodded and then changed the topic,” “However, I’ll give you a choice. Do you accept?”</p><p>“What choice?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I know that the lady called Qiu Yue and the little girl called bubbles are your friends. The choice is clear. You can give them this opportunity and they will be free without fighting. However, you must continue to challenge!</p><p>The desolate race expert spoke.</p><p>“You want to continue the challenge?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>that’s right. You can fight two levels above you and fight with a great saint in the great circle. If you can fight two levels above you and win 100 consecutive victories, you can also regain your freedom!</p><p>The desolate race expert said.</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>crossing two levels and obtaining 100 consecutive victories? impossible! This is absolutely impossible!</p><p>that’s right. That’s impossible. No one can do it, unless those two levels higher are all ordinary people!</p><p>in the history of the desolate race, no one has ever been able to do it. And this time, it’s even more impossible. Don’t forget that our desolate race’s number one genius is currently in the great circle of the great sage realm!</p><p>“This person probably won’t agree, right?”</p><p>It was almost impossible for a heaven’s pride expert to win 100 consecutive victories if he or she was two levels higher.</p><p>However, to everyone’s surprise, Lu Ming nodded his head and his voice spread throughout the entire venue..”Alright, I agree!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
