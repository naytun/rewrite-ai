It was as if it was made of a strange stone.</p><p>six feet. This person is so powerful. A normal King’s body can only pull it out five feet, but this person can pull it out six feet. He’s extraordinary!</p><p>however, six feet is his limit. There have been records since ancient times that an ordinary King’s body can pull it out five feet, and some particularly terrifying King’s bodies can pull it out six feet. The Son of Heaven can pull it out seven feet, and the highest record is eight feet, but it’s very rare even since ancient times!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Many people were discussing. As for the young man, after he pulled out six feet, he had indeed reached his limit. After a few consecutive bursts, the sword did not move at all.</p><p>In the end, the young man had no choice but to give up and retreat. The sword returned to the platform.</p><p>“Interesting. Qiuyue, do you want to try?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled. She was also eager to try.</p><p>“Haha, little girl, you want to try too? 1 bet you can pull it out by three feet. Uncle has high hopes for you!”</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>There were many young people who came here every day to draw their swords, but how many of them could pull it out by three feet? The middle-aged man was just joking.</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled and did not say anything. She stepped onto the platform and grabbed the hilt of her sword.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted as her Saint energy surged and she pulled it up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With three consecutive sword hums, the celestial Emperor’s sword was pulled three feet out.</p><p>The middle-aged man was dumbfounded. He said,” “Still… He really pulled it out by three feet?”</p><p>He had only said it casually just now. He had never expected that this little girl would actually be able to pull it out by three feet.</p><p>“Uncle, it’s not over yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue shouted again, and the laws of yin and yang filled the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of swords clashing rang out continuously, and it rang out three times in a row.</p><p>Six feet!</p><p>King’s body, another King’s body, and an extremely terrifying King’s body!</p><p>another heaven’s chosen who pulled out six feet has appeared. This woman should be a heaven’s chosen from the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Qiu Yue pulled out six feet, causing a heated discussion.</p><p>In the past, it was very rare for someone to pull out six feet. On average, it would take many years for one to appear. Today, in such a short time, two people had appeared in a row, which was very rare.</p><p>Of course, when the yuan mountain sacred Academy had just opened, it was the liveliest. In one day, more than a dozen heaven’s favorites who could pull out five or six feet had appeared, which shocked the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue had reached her limit after pulling it out by six feet. After a few fruitless attempts, she gave up and returned to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Do you want to try?”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at Lu Ming with a curious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming was the son of chaos. She wanted to see how far he could pull.</p><p>At the side, the middle-aged man and the old man sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were walking together. Could it be that they had the same King physique? Could it be that he was also an existence that could pull out five or even six feet? then today would be lively.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 try!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Since he was here, he might as well give it a try.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the platform and many people’s eyes were on him.</p><p>“There are quite a few young people here today!”</p><p>“Indeed. 1 wonder how far this person can pull out?”</p><p>“To be able to come up after two King physiques, he’s probably not simple. Today is really lively!”</p><p>Some of them sized Lu Ming up curiously and looked forward to it. Could it be that Lu Ming could also pull out six feet?</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the sword hilt and held the sword with both hands. He instantly felt a strange, warm energy surge out from the sword hilt and into his body.</p><p>“Can this energy test a person’s cultivation?”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed.</p><p>This was because those who came here to draw their swords had nothing to do with their cultivation.</p><p>A martial Supreme might not even be able to pull it out by one foot, but a person who had just started cultivating could pull it out by five feet.</p><p>“Then let’s see how far 1 can pull it out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he pulled hard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and the long sword was pulled out by a foot.</p><p>“It’s really heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled. The Saint energy in his body surged and his two Saint hearts began to spin rapidly. Endless power poured into Lu Ming’s hands and he pulled up again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Four sword hums resounded, and the sword shone with brilliant light.</p><p>Five feet!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had pulled it out by five feet.</p><p>“He still hasn’t used his laws!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>he didn’t even use his nomological laws, yet he could pull it out by five feet. How is that possible? ”</p><p>“We didn’t see it wrong, right?”</p><p>Everyone was in disbelief.</p><p>To be able to pull it out by five feet without using any laws, this was too shocking.</p><p>The king physique from before looked at Lu Ming with a brilliant light in his eyes.</p><p>“It’s really heavy, but this is not my limit. Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming still did not use the law. He relied on the power of the Holy power and the spirit body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another sword chime rang out.</p><p>Six feet!</p><p>Lu Ming still did not use the law. The entire place was silent and everyone was staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>To be able to pull it out by six feet without using any laws was simply too shocking.</p><p>unbelievable. I wonder what level of nomological law this person’s nomological law is at. If it’s a powerful King path nomological law, he might be able to pull out another foot and be on par with the Son of Heaven!</p><p>Someone said, his voice somewhat interfering.</p><p>The uncle and old man who were chatting with Lu Ming previously were also at a loss for words and were dumbfounded.</p><p>The gentle-looking young man whom they were chatting with earlier was actually so formidable?</p><p>To be able to pull it out by six feet without using any laws, it seemed that only the Galaxy had ever done it, right?</p><p>Didn’t that mean that Lu Ming had already tied the record of the Galaxy?</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. He felt that he had not reached his limit.</p><p>He had refined a wisp of chaotic Qi in his spiritual body, which made his spiritual body much stronger than an upper-class sky spiritual body. Most importantly, he had two Saint hearts, which gave him endless potential.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Other than the laws, all the energy surged into his arms and exploded in an instant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another sword cry resounded through the firmament, and a beam of sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>Seven feet!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled it out by seven feet, but he still did not use the power of law.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was this possible? To be able to pull it out by seven feet without using any laws, this is unprecedented!”</p><p>when the Galaxy has not used its laws, it can only be pulled out by six feet. Doesn’t that mean that Lu Ming has surpassed the Galaxy’s record?”</p><p>some people say that the reason why the star River can pull out six feet without using any nomological laws is that he is the descendant of the celestial Emperor. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to do it. How did this person do it?”</p><p>The scene was out of control, and many people were in disbelief..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
