Under the immense pressure, Lu Ming’s potential was forced out, allowing him to break through the shackles and rush into the peak of the great saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming began to devour large amounts of raw gemstones to stabilize his realm.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming completed the breakthrough. He got up and continued to move forward.</p><p>“The pressure is getting stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>As his cultivation broke through, the pressure from the outside world became stronger.</p><p>The pressure on this ancient path would change according to the cultivation level of the cultivator. Only those who were far stronger than their peers could step on it.</p><p>The pressure grew stronger, but Lu Ming’s cultivation level had increased as well. The pressure he faced was no different from before.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>It was a long process.</p><p>From the 900th step to the 1000th step, including Lu Ming’s breakthrough, he used half a month’s time.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>When Lu Ming took his 1000th step, the elders of the desolate race, as well as desolate li and the rest, were ecstatic.</p><p>They had finally taken the 1000th step. After so many years, there was finally someone who could walk through the ancient Limestone Road. The treasure of their desolate race ancestor was about to be born.</p><p>“The pressure is gone!”</p><p>When Lu Ming took his one-thousandth step, the external pressure disappeared without a trace. Lu Ming felt refreshed and very comfortable.</p><p>I’ve made some breakthroughs in the Laws of Chaos. The chaos tribulation finger should be 61% complete now!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. This trip was not in vain.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to walk and arrived in front of the altar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, as long as you turn the altar, you’ll be able to activate the ancestral treasure!”</p><p>A clan elder reminded him, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He grabbed both sides of the altar and turned it with force.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A cracking sound came from the altar. Then, an infinite amount of light was emitted from the altar. Then, the light gathered and formed a circular ring of light. A piece of crystal-like stone flew out from the ring of light.</p><p>“This … Could it be a power condensation stone?”</p><p>A clan elder looked at the rock that flew out of the circle of light. His body trembled slightly, and he revealed an extremely excited expression.</p><p>The other clan elders, as well as desolate li and the others, were also extremely excited.</p><p>After the ring of light flew out of the stone, it collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>“A power condensation stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. He held the stone in his hand but he could not feel any weight. However, he could feel a strange force acting on his body.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned along the ancient bluestone road.</p><p>However, this time, the ancient bluestone road did not exert any pressure on him. With one step, Lu Ming arrived beside desolate force and the rest.</p><p>“Senior, here!”</p><p>Lu Ming passed the strength condensation stone to a clan elder.</p><p>The clan elder received it excitedly and examined it carefully. His old body trembled slightly because of his excitement.</p><p>“The power condensation stone, it really is the legendary power condensation stone. With the blessings of our ancestors, our clan has finally found the power condensation stone!”</p><p>The desolate race elder held the strength condensation stone in excitement. The other elders were not much different.</p><p>what is the use of this power condensation stone to make these elders of the desolate race, who have lived for who knows how many years, so excited? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>Lu Ming, you still don’t know the significance of the strength condensation stone to our desolate race. This is a Supreme treasure that can allow our desolate race to rise to power. However, in the hands of others, it is of little use</p><p>Desolate said, explaining the function of the power condensation stone.</p><p>The desolate race was an ancient race. They had special physiques, and every single one of them had extremely strong bodies and immense strength.</p><p>Furthermore, what the desolate race cultivated was also related to strength. All sorts of martial techniques, Mystic techniques, and divine powers were related to strength. The intent and nomological laws they comprehended were all related to strength.</p><p>Most people comprehended the law of strength.</p><p>As for the members of the desolate race, if they were exposed to the power condensation stones from a young age, they would be able to improve their physiques. Their bodies would become stronger, and their strength would become stronger. They would be able to better grasp the laws of strength, and they would even be able to easily grasp the laws of extremity.</p><p>The laws of extremity were the laws of the way of the king. If a group of elites who could control the laws of extremity appeared in the desolate race, how terrifying would that be?</p><p>After Lu Ming heard this, he was shocked. It was no wonder the elders of the desolate race were so excited. This was a treasure that could really allow the desolate race to rise.</p><p>Lu Ming, our desolate race will never forget this great favor!</p><p>A few elders of the desolate race bowed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior, you mustn’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly retreated.</p><p>These few desolate race elders had lived for an unknown number of years. Their cultivation levels were unfathomable, so how could he dare to accept them?</p><p>Then, Lu Ming changed the topic and said,”Senior, the other two altars …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the other two ancient bluestone roads.</p><p>the two altars can’t be opened yet. The second ancient Limestone Road requires at least the cultivation of the Martial Emperor realm to step on. I’m afraid that the third one requires a higher cultivation to step on!</p><p>A desolate race elder explained.</p><p>I need to be at least a martial Supreme to enter? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming, I hope that when your cultivation level is higher in the future, you can help my desolate race a few more times!</p><p>A clan elder said very courteously.</p><p>Since Lu Ming could clear the first ancient road, he could clear the second and third one. It was just that his cultivation level was not high enough.</p><p>Of course, they had to build a good relationship with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was beneficial to both parties. It was a win-win situation.</p><p>The desolate race needed Lu Ming’s help, and if Lu Ming needed help in the future, he would also need the desolate race’s help. To Lu Ming, there was no harm in doing so, so why should he not agree?</p><p>Following that, they left the place and returned to the desolate race’s meeting hall. A desolate race elder immediately went to get a few Berserker crystals and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally overjoyed that he had obtained the Berserker crystals.</p><p>On the second day, the desolate race held a huge banquet, as the entire world celebrated.</p><p>At the same time, at the banquet, the desolate race made Lu Ming an elder of another race. His status was second only to the desolate race’s clan leader, and he had great authority.</p><p>As for the desolate race, everyone knew that Lu Ming had stepped onto the ancient Limestone Road and helped the desolate race obtain the strength condensation stone. Naturally, no one objected and they all supported Lu Ming wholeheartedly.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming bade the desolate race elder farewell.</p><p>It had been several months since he came to the savage barren ancient region. He had also obtained the savage crystal. It was time to leave.</p><p>Calculating the time, the heavenly Emperor city’s yuan mountain sacred Academy had already held its meeting for two months.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’ve selected some geniuses from our clan. We’re planning to go out and train with you. What do you think?”</p><p>In the desolate race’s meeting hall, an elder said.</p><p>that’s right. From what you’ve said, there are many prodigies in the outside world with King physiques. Letting them go out and gain experience will allow them to go further. Otherwise, they’ll really think that they’re invincible if they stay in the ancient Savage barren realm every day!</p><p>Another external elder said.</p><p>Desolate Li’s face turned red.</p><p>Before meeting Lu Ming, desolate force was indeed very proud. He felt that he was the leader of the younger generation and was invincible.</p><p>Ever since the battle with Lu Ming, he had completely lost his temper, alright, but I’m afraid we’ll face danger outside! Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Only with danger can we go further!”</p><p>An elder spoke, and this matter was settled..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
