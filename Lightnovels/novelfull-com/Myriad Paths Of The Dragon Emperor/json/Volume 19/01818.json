He planned to let Long Chen and Huang Ling enter the DA yan elixir furnace to refine and evolve their spirit bodies.</p><p>...</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen both cultivated spiritual bodies related to the top ten war beasts. If their spiritual flowers evolved and reached the level of upper-class heavenly spiritual bodies, their combat strength would also soar.</p><p>it can actually temper the spirit body directly and allow the spirit body to evolve?”</p><p>After listening to Lu Ming’s explanation, the two of them were dumbfounded.</p><p>This effect was simply too heaven-defying.</p><p>“Who’s going to go in and try? However, the tempering process is extremely painful. If you can’t hold on, please remind me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the evolution of a spirit body is so heaven-defying that a little pain is nothing. I’ll go first!</p><p>Long Chen stepped forward.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the lid and let Long Chen in. Then, he put in a large amount of sacred medicine and closed the furnace.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming took control of the elixir furnace. The elixir fire burned fiercely inside the furnace, enveloping Long Chen and beginning to temper his physical body.</p><p>Long Chen was also a person with a strong will. How could he give up in such intense pain? he gritted his teeth and endured it.</p><p>Seven days later, Long Chen reached his limit and came out of the furnace.</p><p>“The effect is indeed amazing!”</p><p>Long Chen sighed.</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>Huang Ling couldn’t wait any longer and stepped into the furnace.</p><p>In the following days, Huang Ling and Long Chen took turns to enter the Dayan elixir furnace to temper their spirit bodies. Lu Ming split some of his attention to pay attention to the elixir furnace, while most of his energy was still on his own cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed. Long Chen’s and Phoenix Spirit’s spiritual bodies had finally been tempered to the extreme and had evolved into the ranks of the top-tier celestial spiritual bodies. Their combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>With their potential and their own cultivation, they would be able to evolve sooner or later and step into the upper-class celestial spiritual body, but it was unknown how long it would take.</p><p>Lu Ming, the Phoenix Palace sent me a message earlier. The date of the heavenly Emperor city’s yuan mountain Saint Academy’s opening ceremony has been set. It will be in half a year!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“In half a year?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He definitely had to make a trip to the heavenly Emperor City. The yuan mountain sacred Academy was established by a few great emperors and there would be great emperors giving Dao lectures. He couldn’t miss such a good opportunity.</p><p>Moreover, the top geniuses of the entire Yuan mountain would gather at the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Lu Ming also wanted to go and see for himself. Only by clashing with powerful geniuses could he improve faster.</p><p>right now, all the geniuses are cultivating hard and their progress is extremely fast. We should make use of this period of time to raise our cultivation. With our strength, it wouldn’t be too difficult for us to occupy a place in the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>The few of them chatted for a while more before Feng Ling and Long Chen bade farewell and returned to their respective sects to cultivate.</p><p>As soon as Feng Ling returned to the Phoenix Palace, someone came to find her.</p><p>“Feng Ling, the palace Master is looking for you!”</p><p>The messenger reported.</p><p>“Palace Master? Alright, I’ll go now!”</p><p>yes. Huang Ling nodded and walked towards the palace master’s Hall.</p><p>In the main hall, the palace Master stood with her hands behind her back, as if she was thinking about something.</p><p>I’m Huang Ling, Palace Master. May I know why you’ve summoned me?”</p><p>Huang Ling came to the back of the Phoenix Palace Master and bowed respectfully.</p><p>The master of the Phoenix Palace turned around and glanced at Feng Ling. Her eyes lit up in surprise. “Feng Ling, your spirit body has evolved?”</p><p>yes, Palace Master. It has just evolved recently!</p><p>Huang Ling said. She didn’t say that it was because of the DA yan elixir furnace that she evolved.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace’s effects were too heaven-defying. Lu Ming told them this because he trusted them. Naturally, they would not tell anyone about it, even if it was the person they were closest to or the palace Master of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>alright, I have a matter here. I was originally considering whether to let you go or not, but now that your spirit body has evolved and your combat strength has increased greatly, it’s a good time for you to go and gain experience!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord said.</p><p>“Palace Master, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked curiously.</p><p>“It’s about the shenyuan Empire!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord said.</p><p>ancient sun sacred land? God Yuan Empire? ” Huang Ling’s expression changed.</p><p>Ancient yang sacred land was also one of the nine sacred lands of Yuan mountain, and it was close to ancient Moon sacred land.</p><p>The shenyuan Empire was one of the ancient sun Holy Land’s major powers. It was an ancient empire, and its strength was much stronger than Phoenix Palace.</p><p>that’s right. Some time ago, the old Emperor of the shenyuan Empire failed to survive the crisis of heaven and earth. He was annihilated in the crisis!</p><p>The palace Lord of Phoenix Palace said with a complicated expression.</p><p>the old Emperor of the shenyuan Empire has failed his tribulation!</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression changed as well.</p><p>The old Emperor of the shenyuan Empire was an unimaginable existence. He was extremely terrifying. Even if he wasn’t a great emperor, he was at least a peak existence among true emperors. An expert like him was almost at the peak, but he still couldn’t survive the Great Tribulation and fell under it.</p><p>with the death of the old Emperor, the shenyuan Empire lost its ruler. In order to fight for the emperor’s position, the various branches had internal strife and a fierce battle broke out. The battle caused the shenyuan Empire to suffer heavy losses. In the end, a few ancient emperors who had been in seclusion appeared and quelled the internal strife with their terrifying combat power!</p><p>however, a country can not go a day without a ruler. The ancient emperors selected three of the most talented princes from the younger generation of the divine Yuan Empire to undergo a test. The Prince who wins will become the Crown Prince of the divine Yuan Empire. As long as he becomes an Emperor in the future, he will be able to take over the throne and become the new emperor!</p><p>one of the princes ‘descendants has always been on good terms with the Phoenix Palace. A few days ago, he came to the Phoenix Palace and asked some geniuses to help him fight for the position of Crown Prince!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord explained.</p><p>Huang Ling was enlightened. So that was what happened.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Master was probably referring to helping the shenyuan Empire’s Prince.</p><p>the shenyuan Empire is very powerful, far stronger than many of the forces in ancient Moon Holy Land. If we can help this Prince become the Crown Prince, or even inherit the entire shenyuan Empire in the future, then our Phoenix Palace will also receive a powerful support!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord explained.</p><p>don’t worry, Palace Master. I’ll do my best to help the Prince!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>yes, but just do your best. If there’s danger, don’t force yourself. This time, the other princes of the shenyuan Empire will probably invite some powerful heaven’s favorites to help. Just do what you can. I’ll bring you to meet the prince!</p><p>The master of the Phoenix Palace warned, then asked someone to bring Feng Ling to the Prince.</p><p>In a courtyard, Huang Ling met the Prince.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang, it’s you?”</p><p>Seeing the Prince, Huang Ling was shocked.</p><p>“A Phoenix spirit?”</p><p>The Prince of the shenyuan Empire, Ouyang Wushuang, was also surprised. He had not expected to see Feng Ling here.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely be surprised.</p><p>This was because the shenyuan Empire’s Prince, Ouyang Wushuang, was one of the six people who had passed the Hunyuan sect’s assessment and become a silver inheritor.</p><p>Previously, they only knew each other’s names, but they did not know the other’s detailed information..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
