In any case, the area here was vast and incomparably empty, so there were plenty of empty courtyards.</p><p>The next day, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others brought Lu Ming and the others around the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>the yuan mountain sacred Academy was built by a few great emperors and other Emperor-ranked experts. They spent several years to build it. There are many wondrous places that are extremely helpful to cultivation!</p><p>As the group walked, Huang Ling introduced them.</p><p>that’s true. In the past few months, many people have entered the yuan mountain sacred Academy and used the resources here to improve their cultivation. We are the same!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“How many geniuses are there in the yuan mountain sacred Academy?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“It’s beyond our imagination!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression was serious, the requirements to enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy are to be at the bright Saint realm and have a low-tier heavenly spiritual body. This time, there are more than ten thousand people from the nine Holy Lands, various monarch-level forces, and some ancient clans!</p><p>“Over ten thousand people!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. He was very shocked.</p><p>There were actually over ten thousand people who met the requirements. How shocking was this?</p><p>These people all had the potential to become Saint emperors. Even if they only had the potential, it was impossible for so many of them to become Saint emperors. That was already extremely shocking.</p><p>There were so many people in a generation.</p><p>There were many Emperor-level powerhouses in the yuan mountain, but they had been accumulated over countless years. It would be terrifying if thousands of martial emperors appeared in a generation.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood what the golden age was!</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw a stone tablet soaring into the sky. It was as tall as the mountain peak and could be seen at a glance even from far away.</p><p>“That’s the Saint King ranking, let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The group moved forward and soon appeared under the huge stone tablet.</p><p>There were names on the stone tablet that were giving off a golden light. At a glance, there were about forty names.</p><p>the Saint King ranking represents the strongest group of people in the Saint realm in the yuan mountain Saint Academy. However, those who want to be on the ranking must be at least in the Saint realm. The Golden Crow Crown Prince was at the bottom, but he has disappeared!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>I heard that only 100 people can make it onto the Saint King ranking, but since most of them haven’t reached the absolute Saint level yet, there are only 42 people!</p><p>Long Chen added.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. It seemed that there were only forty-two absolute Saints in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. If everyone’s cultivation improved in the future, there would be more than a hundred absolute Saints. Then, the Saint King ranking would only show the strongest one hundred people.</p><p>“The star River!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the forty-two names. The first name was the most eye-catching. It was called the eternal Star River.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, this person is extremely terrifying. He is one of the sons of God, born with an eternal body, and controls one of the ten strongest laws, the eternal law. It is said that this person is the descendant of the heavenly Emperor, and he has the bloodline of the heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Huang Ling spoke. When she spoke of this person, her expression became very serious and fearful.</p><p>“The descendant of the heavenly Emperor, the heavenly Emperor who founded heavenly Emperor City?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. Although the heavenly Emperor has fallen, he has left behind descendants who are one of the strongest forces in the heavenly Emperor City!</p><p>Huang Ling nodded.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to look at the names.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong, 10th!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Luo cangqiong, the number one genius of the Daluo heaven sect, had deprived Qiu Yue of her memory. Lu Ming would have to fight with him sooner or later, the death blade is only ranked twelfth? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The death blade was one of the six silver inheritors of the Hunyuan sect. He controlled the death law and was the son of death, one of the ten strongest laws. He was also one of the sons of God like Heng Xing and ah Tong, but his ranking was much lower.</p><p>the death blade’s cultivation is a little weak, so his ranking isn’t high!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a familiar face. It was Luo Tianyi, who was ranked 36th.</p><p>“Is this ranking accurate? What is the basis for that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>when the yuan mountain sacred Academy first opened, all the geniuses swarmed in at the same time. No one was willing to submit to the other, and naturally, intense battles broke out. Many of the Supreme geniuses clashed with each other and the rankings of the teachers of the sacred Academy were determined by the battles.</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Isn’t this not allowed?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, because some people are more low-key and didn’t use their full strength, some people didn’t even make a move, so this Saint King ranking isn’t very accurate for the time being. Some of the lower rankings might have astonishing battle strength, but no one can say for sure, I guess it will be rearranged in the future?”</p><p>also, after a few months of fighting, the strongest geniuses have all entered the absolute Saint battlefield to cultivate in seclusion. They’re trying to break through and suppress everyone else!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“So many chosen! This is great! Hahaha!”</p><p>Desolate li was extremely excited. The other members of the desolate race were similarly excited. Their eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming memorized the dozens of names on the Saint King ranking and the group walked in the other direction.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming saw many wonderful places, many of which were helpful for cultivation.</p><p>For example, one of the places was called the mystic purgatory Valley. There were powerful challenges there, and one could cultivate mystic arts.</p><p>However, one had to pay a certain amount of raw stones to enter these places.</p><p>A large amount of energy was required to maintain these cultivation grounds. Although the great emperors had built them, they did not have enough resources to maintain them. Naturally, they had to collect the corresponding orirocks.</p><p>1’11 cultivate here. You guys can choose where you want to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming said to the desolate race.</p><p>Only by choosing the most suitable place for cultivation would it be of the greatest help.</p><p>I’m cultivating here with brother Lu Ming!</p><p>Pao Pao said.</p><p>divine power, purgatory Valley. We’ve been here for a while. Let’s go somewhere else to cultivate!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“I want to go to the power God Valley!”</p><p>Desolate li revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Then, everyone split up and went to choose their own places to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles walked towards the divine ability, purgatory Valley.</p><p>The sacred art, purgatory Valley, was a vast Valley. It was pitch black inside, and nothing could be seen. It was as if it led to the abyss of purgatory.</p><p>A profound formation had been set up here, and it could accommodate many people to cultivate at the same time.</p><p>There were naturally guards at the entrance of the valley. Before entering, one had to apply for a Jade card to enter the valley and store some raw stones inside.</p><p>Then, for every day of cultivation, the Jade card would deduct one day’s worth of raw stones.</p><p>If a person cultivated inside for too long, the raw stones deposited in advance would be deducted and they would have to pay back when they came out.</p><p>Lu Ming stored bubbles and three months ‘worth of raw gemstones at one go. He then walked into the divine ability, purgatory Valley..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
