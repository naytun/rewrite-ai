Ouyang Wuji’s side was gradually losing and the number of people he killed was increasing. He was starting to be suppressed by Ouyang wudao.</p><p>...</p><p>In the end, the battle formations of both sides collapsed and turned into a chaotic battle.</p><p>However, Ouyang wudao had the advantage in numbers and still had the upper hand.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, a battle cry came from behind. Thousands of soldiers in silver armor charged over.</p><p>They were the thousands of people that Ouyang Wuji had left behind to guard the military camp. Since the start of the battle, he had deployed these thousands of people over.</p><p>With the addition of thousands of fresh troops, Ouyang Wuji managed to turn the tables. Both sides once again entered a heated battle.</p><p>On the battlefield, rays of light continuously shot up into the sky, creating a gorgeous and colorful scene.</p><p>The number of people on both sides was getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>Slowly, the number of people on both sides dropped below 10000, then to 8000, then to 7000.</p><p>When the number dropped to five to six thousand, the two sides finally stopped fighting. They slowly retreated and faced each other from a distance.</p><p>“Sixth brother, I won the first round!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao spoke.</p><p>In the first round, he had secured first place with his battle achievements.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji was a little unwilling, but he knew that he could not win against Ouyang wudao in this round. However, he could at least obtain second place.</p><p>Although he was left with five to six thousand men, he had killed a large number of Ouyang wudao’s soldiers and his battle merits were far above Ouyang Wushuang’s.</p><p>If he got second place, he might have a chance to win the next two rounds as long as he grasped the opportunity.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from behind Ouyang Wuji’s Army, shaking the sky.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji turned around and his expression changed. He saw a black torrent rushing toward them.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, Humph, he wants to take advantage of us and turn the tables. Big brother, why don’t we join hands and completely destroy his hope!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji sneered.</p><p>“Alright, since he wants to join in the fun, I’ll completely destroy him!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao coldly replied.</p><p>He and Ouyang Wuji each had five to six thousand men. Adding them together, they had more than ten thousand men. They could easily annihilate Ouyang Wuji’s few thousand men.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji’s Army charged toward Ouyang Wushuang from two different directions.</p><p>The three different colored torrents were about to collide.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>In the Army, Ouyang Wushuang gave the order.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar resounded through the sky. A huge true dragon was formed in Ouyang Wushuang’s Army. This true dragon was blood red and full of cold killing intent.</p><p>The true dragon was the first to charge toward Ouyang Wuji’s Army.</p><p>if you want to attack me, I’ll block you and surround you with Ouyang wudao. We’ll annihilate you in an instant!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji laughed coldly. His Army also formed a battle formation, and a Mantis appeared.</p><p>The blood-red true dragon and the Mantis collided fiercely.</p><p>However, the result shocked Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>This was because the result of the collision was that the Mantis formation on his side collapsed. Many people were killed by the terrifying power, turning into light and disappearing.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji roared in disbelief. How could the enemy’s battle formation be so powerful?</p><p>the true dragon battle formation has always been powerful, and the other party has just experienced a bitter battle. Their true energy is not enough, and they are exhausted. Their combat power is less than half of their peak, so how can they fight against the true dragon battle formation? ”</p><p>In the Army, Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>If the other party was at their peak and had about the same number of people, no matter how powerful the true dragon battle formation was, they would not be able to crush them.</p><p>But now, the other party’s exhausted Army was completely crushed.</p><p>The Dragon’s roars continued to ring out as the blood-red true dragon’s claw struck out continuously. Large groups of Ouyang Wuji’s Army were annihilated, turning into light and disappearing.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang wudao’s Army had also arrived.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood-red true dragon changed its direction and charged toward Ouyang wudao’s Army.</p><p>Ouyang wudao’s Army was also exhausted. Similar to Ouyang Wuji, after being attacked by the blood-red true dragon, their battle formation was also on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>How could Ouyang Wushuang let go of this opportunity? he led his Army into a formation and charged into Ouyang wudao’s group.</p><p>Every time the huge true dragon body attacked, a large number of soldiers would be killed.</p><p>“Ouyang Wuji, come and help!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao roared.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Wuji couldn’t care about Ouyang wudao. He gathered the remnants of his troops and quickly retreated.</p><p>“Dammit! We’ve been tricked!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao howled.</p><p>At this moment, how could he not understand that he had fallen into a trap?</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang actually had such a powerful battle formation. However, the twenty thousand troops from before did not cultivate it. Instead, they cultivated the heavenly Tiger roaring sky formation. From the beginning to the end, this had been a trap.</p><p>The purpose was to make him and Ouyang Wuji fight each other. What a terrifying scheme.</p><p>But at this time, he was already powerless to reverse the situation.</p><p>The situation was similar to the last time he led his Army to slaughter Ouyang Wushuang’s Army. Unfortunately, this time, he was the one being slaughtered.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, I’ll be waiting for you in the last two rounds. The crown prince’s position is mine!</p><p>Ouyang wudao roared as he was grabbed by the blood-red Dragon Claw. His body exploded, turned into a ray of light, and disappeared.</p><p>Along with Ouyang wudao’s death, Ouyang wudao’s Army was also completely annihilated.</p><p>“Go and kill Ouyang Wuji!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang shouted and the Army chased after Ouyang Wuji’s Army.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji led his Army and fled in a sorry state. Unfortunately, they were exhausted and could not escape in the end. Lu Ming and the rest caught up to them and annihilated them.</p><p>In the end, Ouyang Wushuang’s Army was left with only 3000 people. However, they had won and annihilated the other two sides. Without a doubt, the winner of this battle was Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The faces of the paragons from the purple flame villa turned pale.</p><p>Although Ouyang Wushuang had won, their hearts had fallen to the bottom.</p><p>They had lost the bet. From then on, they had to listen to Lu Ming’s orders for the next fifty years.</p><p>They had made a blood oath, and if they didn’t obey, they would be surrounded by their inner demons in the future. It would be difficult for them to make any progress in their cultivation, and they might even go into Qi deviation.</p><p>“You’ve lost. Do you understand what to do now?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the paragons of the purple flame villa.</p><p>The Paragon from the purple flame villa had an ugly look on his face. His expression changed, but he did not dare to break his oath. He lowered his proud head and saluted Lu Ming.</p><p>They understood that they had been tricked by Lu Ming. It turned out that Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang had secretly trained another group of troops and used other battle formations. It was no wonder that Ouyang Wushuang had been following Lu Ming’s orders.</p><p>This was clearly a trap for them to jump into, but they just jumped in.</p><p>fifty years will pass in the blink of an eye. I’ll bear with it for now. After fifty years, I’ll kill this Lu Ming to vent my anger!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng comforted himself in his heart.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites of the purple flame villa had similar thoughts.</p><p>After that, they left the array world. As expected, the upper echelons of the shenyuan Empire announced the results of the assessment.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was first, Ouyang wudao was second, and Ouyang Wuji was third..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
