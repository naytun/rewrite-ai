They were all top heaven’s favorites from the various forces.</p><p>...</p><p>For example, mo lang was the number one genius in the Skywolf tower, and the second Prince of the Golden Crow clan was the number two genius in the Golden Crow clan…</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>When ink Wolf, the second Prince of the Golden Crow race, and the rest saw Lu Ming, their expressions changed abruptly and became somewhat unsightly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name was too well-known in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Not long ago, he had killed Falcon and Wan Zhengyang, both of whom were not weaker than them. Their expressions were naturally ugly, revealing a deep fear.</p><p>it’s good that Lu Ming came to the ancient yang sacred land. We can leave him to the geniuses of the sole sacred Hall. Every single one of them is shockingly powerful. It’s hard for anyone of the same level to be a match for them. We can kill Lu Ming!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Mo lang, the Golden Crow second Prince, and the others were secretly communicating with each other. All kinds of thoughts were running through their minds.</p><p>haha, ninth brother, I’m very grateful that all of you have come to this banquet today. Let me toast you all!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji raised his cup and said a few polite words.</p><p>Everyone raised their cups and drank a cup.</p><p>ninth brother, the test will begin in a few days. Are you ready? ”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji suddenly said as he put down his wine cup.</p><p>“Of course, when the time comes, I hope sixth brother will show mercy!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile. His words were watertight.</p><p>“Ninth brother, are you confident about this assessment?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji suddenly changed the topic.</p><p>big brother has the support of the Daluo heaven sect and is very powerful. I’m not sure!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang sighed.</p><p>that’s right. You have the support of the Daluo heaven sect, which is full of geniuses and powerhouses. I’m afraid you and I can’t compete with them. So, I invited you here to discuss something with you!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>“Sixth brother might as well be direct!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>alright, I’ll be Frank. You and I won’t be big brother’s match even if we separate. How about we work together? ninth brother will help me become the Crown Prince. I won’t forget you in the future. When I inherit the throne, you will be above everyone else in the shenyuan Empire. How about that? ”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji revealed his purpose.</p><p>His words caused the faces of all the paragons of the purple flame villa to change.</p><p>However, Ouyang Wushuang’s expression did not change. He played with the jade cup in his hand and seemed to be thinking. After a while, he slowly said,” “Sixth brother’s idea is not bad!”</p><p>“You agree?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji was overjoyed.</p><p>I didn’t say I agreed. I just said that it’s a good idea. How about this? sixth brother, help me win the position of Crown Prince. I can also guarantee that you will be second only to one person and above thousands of people in the future. What do you think? ”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile.</p><p>“Ninth brother, are you toying with me?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face darkened.</p><p>how did I trick you? why? I can help you, but you can’t help me? ”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said indifferently.</p><p>ninth brother, you have to know your own strength. You and your helpers will only be a foil in this assessment. You won’t stand a chance!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s voice turned cold.</p><p>His words made the people from the purple flame villa’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s words implied that the purple flame villa was weak and not as good as the one and only holy temple.</p><p>In fact, that was the truth.</p><p>Of the four forces of the ancient yang sacred land, the purple flame villa was the weakest.</p><p>Although the number of disciples in the unique divine temple was the smallest, their title of being unique was not just for show. Every single disciple of the unique divine temple had terrifying talent in their own fields.</p><p>“Sixth brother, you’re that confident?” Ouyang Wushuang was not angry.</p><p>“It’s not confidence, it’s the truth!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji spoke with great confidence. He continued, ninth brother, to put it bluntly, you’re weak to begin with. What qualifications do you have for me to help you? why don’t you help me defeat big brother?”</p><p>“Sixth brother, you can’t just say who’s strong or weak with your mouth!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said indifferently.</p><p>“Oh? So, ninth brother is confident in competing with me?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang didn’t finish his words. He took a sip of the wine, which was a silent agreement.</p><p>“Haha, good. Since ninth brother is so confident, sixth brother would like to see it for himself. Why don’t we have a friendly match?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>“How do we spar?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang asked.</p><p>you and I are well aware of our combat strength. There’s no need to spar. Let’s see who is stronger!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang nodded. He understood that the main purpose of Ouyang Wuji’s invitation was to suppress his morale and then persuade him to help Ouyang Wuji.</p><p>How could he give in?</p><p>“Set up the battle stage!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s voice rang out.</p><p>Immediately, there was a roar in the open space, and then a huge fighting ring emerged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On Ouyang Wuji’s side, a figure flickered out and stood on the fighting ring. He did not hide his aura at all. Layers of white flames bloomed, causing the space around him to constantly distort.</p><p>I’m Yu kun, the only disciple of the Holy Temple. I’m a great saint in the exceptional realm and am good at the law of fire. The purple flame villa is also good at the law of fire. Which great saint in the exceptional realm would like to fight me?”</p><p>Yu Shu’s gaze swept past Lu Ming and the others. However, it only swept past Lu Ming and his group before landing on the people from the purple flame villa.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A sovereign from the purple flame villa stepped into the air and rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>This person was the one who was defeated by Lu Ming yesterday.</p><p>The two of them stood on the fighting ring, their auras bursting forth, causing the fighting ring to heat up.</p><p>A light screen rose around the fighting ring to isolate the heat.</p><p>The two of them didn’t waste any words and immediately started fighting.</p><p>Both of them cultivated the flame Maxim, which was filled with terrifying destructive power. Their attacks collided continuously, causing loud rumbles and blazing flames.</p><p>However, Yu Shu’s white flame, which was unknown, was extremely powerful. After a few moves, he gained the upper hand and began to suppress the purple flame villa’s genius.</p><p>After a dozen or so moves, the purple flame villa’s sovereign was no match for Yu Shu. He was thrown out of the fighting ring by Yu Shu’s punch and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Yu Shu was defeated. They were both great saints in the Great Perfection, but he was defeated by the other party in a dozen moves.</p><p>This made all the geniuses of the purple flame villa have ugly expressions. Even Ouyang Wushuang’s face darkened.</p><p>I’ve long heard that every single heaven’s favorite from the one and only sacred temple is extremely terrifying. They’re said to be the only ones in the world, and every attribute and domain is unique. It’s truly shocking!</p><p>Huang Ling said softly.</p><p>that’s right. Yu Shu’s white flame is extremely strange. It can even burn flames!</p><p>Said Long Chen with a serious expression.</p><p>The flame could actually burn other flames. It was really strange and terrifying.</p><p>“You’re even worthy of cultivating the law of fire?”</p><p>Yu Shu stood on the fighting ring, looking down at the geniuses of the purple flame villa with disdain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
