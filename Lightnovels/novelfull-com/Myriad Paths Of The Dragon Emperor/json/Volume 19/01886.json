This place became his grave, attracting thousands of swords to pay homage to him. Countless ownerless swords flew here and were buried here with the terrifying swordsman.</p><p>Behind them, there were countless powerful sword cultivators who coveted that existence’s inheritance. In order to fight for that sword cultivator’s inheritance, a tragic battle occurred here.</p><p>Countless powerful swordsmen had died in battle here, their bones buried here.</p><p>This place had become a terrifying sword tomb.</p><p>Later on, many sword cultivators would come here when they reached the end of their lives and were about to die.</p><p>As time passed, the number of experts and swords buried here was already unknown, endless.</p><p>Over time, the Taiyi sword tomb also produced some wonderful treasures.</p><p>For example, the sword source was a rare treasure. Refining the sword source could refine one’s true essence and Saint power to improve one’s cultivation.</p><p>There were also some people who would come here in search of swords with spirituality.</p><p>Since ancient times, too many swordsmen had been buried here. It was said that there were even many Emperor-level swordsmen. Some people’s swords were real treasures. If one was lucky enough to get them, they would be rich.</p><p>Therefore, the Taiyi sword tomb had attracted many people to explore it.</p><p>Every year, many people would come, especially those who cultivated the sword.</p><p>The great sui treasure Lotus had been discovered by the people who had explored this place.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the area. Indeed, he saw some figures near the cave.</p><p>“You two…”</p><p>A gentle-looking elder flew over and sized up Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. He smiled and said,”The two of you also want to enter the sword tomb to explore, right?” “Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>just as well. This old man and some friends want to form a team and enter the sword tomb together. After all, there are opportunities in the sword tomb, but there are also dangers. The more people there are, the stronger we can be. We can help each other. Little friends, are you willing to enter together? ”</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>“Do you want to form a team?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>The Taiyi sword tomb had both opportunities and dangers.</p><p>Since ancient times, there had been many experts buried here, and it had also given birth to some dangerous creatures, and that was the sword fiend.</p><p>The sword fiend would kill any living being it encountered. It had no intelligence.</p><p>There were strong and weak swordfiends. Some swordfiends were extremely strong and it was very dangerous to encounter them alone. Hence, it was normal for many people to choose to form teams to enter.</p><p>“Senior, we’re here to find a Saint herb.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, that’s great. The Taiyi sword tomb is very vast. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack with just the two of you. Come with us and pay attention to each other. We’ll have a greater chance!</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>The old man’s words made sense. It was indeed very difficult for the two of them to search. If they formed a team with more people, the chances would be higher.</p><p>Moreover, some of these people might have been here for a long time, so they might be able to get some useful information.</p><p>“Alright, haha, come, let me introduce you to the others!”</p><p>The old man smiled and led Lu Ming and Qiu Yue to the others.</p><p>There were eight people at the entrance of the cave, and the old man introduced them.</p><p>After the old man’s introduction, Lu Ming knew that his name was Wu Chu. He had a cultivation base of a perfected absolute Saint. Among these people, the old man’s cultivation base was the highest.</p><p>“My two young friends, we will have to wait for a while more. We will enter when there are more people!”</p><p>Wu Chu said. He always had a gentle smile on his face, giving people a feeling that he was easy to get along with.</p><p>“It’s fine to wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The search for the astral treasure Lotus couldn’t be done overnight, so it didn’t matter if he waited a few more days.</p><p>There were indeed many people who came to explore the Taiyi sword tomb. After that, there would be people coming every two days, and they would all be pulled into the group by chief Wu.</p><p>Ten days later, there were more than twenty people in their group.</p><p>“Alright, we’re almost there. Let’s go!”</p><p>Wu Chu said. Then, he flew towards the cave with the others following.</p><p>This cave was extremely huge and led underground. Its depth was unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group flew down and finally reached the bottom after flying for about 10000 feet.</p><p>“This … It really is like an underground world!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the cave and realized that it was a completely different world. He could not see the end of it.</p><p>There were many mountain peaks here, but it was deathly silent. There was nothing.</p><p>There was only a sword.</p><p>The rusty swords were either stuck in the ground or on the mountain peaks.</p><p>However, almost all of them had lost their spirituality and were on the verge of corrosion over the years.</p><p>“Let’s set up a formation so that we won’t be flustered when we’re attacked!”</p><p>Wu Chu said. He would arrange the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were arranged to be at the back. Some of them were in the middle, while others were in front, left, and right.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered slightly. He realized that the people who were arranged to the front, back, left, and right were those who had joined the team later.</p><p>Chief Wu brought five to six people and was in the middle.</p><p>According to him, he had the highest cultivation level, so he was in the middle and could support the four sides at any time.</p><p>No one had any objections, so they chose a direction and ran forward.</p><p>The Taiyi sword tomb gave people the impression that it was dead silent.</p><p>The world was silent, with the occasional gust of cold wind. Not a single blade of grass grew, and it was extremely desolate.</p><p>They ran forward for hundreds of miles, and the scenery they saw was almost the same.</p><p>This was the outer region. All the swords they had encountered had rotted away. There would not be any gains in this area.</p><p>He didn’t know how far he had walked, but suddenly, two figures floated over.</p><p>These were two black shadows. Their faces could not be seen clearly, but they were like ghosts.</p><p>As soon as the two black shadows saw Lu Ming and the group, their eyes emitted a sharp aura. They turned into two sword lights and rushed toward the group.</p><p>“There are two sword fiends, but they are only at the bright Saint realm!”</p><p>Wu Chu said. With a wave of his hand, two streams of Qi shot out and destroyed the two sword fiends.</p><p>After the two swordfiends were destroyed, they turned into two streams of energy and sank into the ground, disappearing.</p><p>It was said that it was very difficult to kill the sword fiend. It could only be defeated temporarily. After being defeated, it would escape into the ground. After a period of time, it could reappear.</p><p>The group continued forward and encountered a few more swordfiends behind them. However, they were not strong and were easily defeated.</p><p>Suddenly, a weak sword intent came from the front.</p><p>“There’s a sword source ahead!”</p><p>Chief Wu’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Obviously, it was not chief Wu’s first time in the Taiyi sword tomb. He was very experienced and could tell that there was a sword source ahead based on a faint sword essence.</p><p>Everyone concealed their auras and advanced carefully. After bypassing a mountain peak, they saw dozens of sword fiends.</p><p>What was different was that these dozens of sword fiends looked very solid, as if they were real. Their bodies emitted an astonishingly sharp Qi, like divine swords..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
