He also knew that uncle Kong was doing this for his own good. A powerful person had to fight and kill to become one. He had to go through all kinds of difficulties and dangers.</p><p>The flowers in the greenhouse could not stand the test.</p><p>If he needed uncle Kong to help him everywhere, how could he reach the peak?</p><p>“Hall Master, let’s go back and recuperate!”</p><p>Uncle Kong nodded and walked back to the mountain of the pill furnace step by step. Soon after, Lu Ming also returned to the mountain of the pill furnace. He swallowed a pill and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was severely injured. It took him seven days to fully recover.</p><p>A few days later, Huang Ling, Long Chen, mu Qingxue, and the others came to visit him. Seeing that Lu Ming was fine, they were relieved. Lu Ming took them around the Dayan elixir Hall.</p><p>However, Phoenix and the others did not stay for long. They returned to their respective sects.</p><p>Now, the day of the opening of the yuan mountain sacred Academy in heavenly Emperor City was getting closer and closer. Everyone had to seize the time to cultivate and improve their cultivation so that they could enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy smoothly and receive the guidance of the great emperor,</p><p>Lu Ming passed on the divine breath technique to Huang Ling and the rest. It was a life-saving secret technique and would be of great use at critical moments.</p><p>After Huang Ling and the rest left, Lu Ming began his closed-door cultivation.</p><p>can the alchemy fire of the Dayan elixir furnace really temper and evolve the spirit body? ”</p><p>With a single thought, the Dayan elixir furnace flew out and landed on the ground. It then transformed into the size of a house.</p><p>During this period of time, elder Kong had told Lu Ming about some of the great Yan elixir furnace’s wonderful uses.</p><p>The Dayan elixir furnace seized the good fortune of heaven and earth. It could be used to refine elixirs using the laws of heaven and earth, and it could also refine elixirs that could evolve the spirit body.</p><p>This was just a rumor, but in fact, the Dayan elixir furnace was even more mysterious than the rumors. It could directly temper a person’s physical body and allow the spirit body to evolve.</p><p>“Til try!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a large number of sacred elixirs flew out of his storage ring and into the Dayan elixir furnace. Then, Lu Ming moved and rushed into the furnace as well, closing the lid.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>With a single thought, a large amount of alchemy fire spewed out of the Dayan elixir furnace and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This kind of alchemy fire was extremely terrifying. The Emperor-level powerhouses of the Sirius tower had been refined by this alchemy fire.</p><p>Alchemy fire had the power to destroy, but it also had an unparalleled vitality. It was completely controlled by the user’s will.</p><p>The pill fire gushed out, and the Saint herbs were instantly refined and turned into waves of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was enveloped by the alchemic fire and a piercing pain spread throughout his body.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist, but the pill fire covered his body and burned fiercely as if it was going to melt his body.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was being roasted by the pill fire, emitting sizzling sounds. He felt as if his body was about to melt.</p><p>It hurt! It was extremely painful! A heart-piercing pain!</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and endured it. He persevered.</p><p>He knew that it was not easy for a spirit body to evolve. If he wanted to buy real dragon bones and real dragon blood essence, he would need a lot of raw gemstones.</p><p>But now, there was a shortcut, so why not take it?</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and persevered. After a while, the energy from the sacred herbs in the alchemy furnace began to gather towards Lu Ming. As the alchemy fire refined them, they continuously seeped into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his spirit body was slowly becoming stronger.</p><p>He cultivated for seven days. When Lu Ming felt that he had reached his limit, he exited the furnace. After a day of rest, he put in some sacred herbs and continued to smelt them.</p><p>This method was similar to refining pills.</p><p>However, he was using himself as a pill and the Saint herbs as supplementary ingredients. He was constantly smelting and removing the impurities in the spirit body. The energy of the Saint herbs was integrated into the spirit body, constantly increasing the potential of the spirit body. When the time came, the potential of the spirit body would explode and transform.</p><p>Such an effect was heaven-defying.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it might not be a big deal. He cultivated the Dragon God combat body. As long as he had true dragon bones and true dragon blood essence, he would evolve sooner or later.</p><p>But what about ordinary martial artists? How heaven-defying was this effect?</p><p>In other words, no matter what level the spirit body was, as long as one continued to condense it, the spirit body would continue to evolve.</p><p>Of course, there wore some restrictions. There would be some differences according to the individual’s potential.</p><p>Some people could continue to evolve, but some people had limited potential. Even with the Dayan elixir furnace, they wouldn’t evolve much and would have a limit.</p><p>However, this was already heaven-defying enough. Therefore, elder Kong warned that this ability should not be revealed unless one was extremely close to the great Yan cauldron. This was because the outside world only thought that the great Yan cauldron could refine medicinal pills that could allow one’s spirit body to evolve, but they didn’t know that it had this ability.</p><p>To concoct a pill, one needed materials. Without materials, one would not be able to concoct it.</p><p>However, this function didn’t require any specific ingredients at all. Any Saint medicine could be added in.</p><p>If a major power obtained this, how many geniuses could it nurture?</p><p>At that time, even with elder Kong standing guard, it would still be hard to avoid some major powers taking the risk out of desperation.</p><p>Seven days passed, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating in the Dayan elixir furnace. Bubbles, on the other hand, had nothing to do and would run out every day. Lu Ming did not bother with it.</p><p>With bubble’s current cultivation base and the spacetime laws, she should be fine as long as she did not encounter any monarch-level experts.</p><p>As expected, Baoba came back every few days with a medicinal fragrance all over his body. He even gave Lu Ming many sacred elixirs.</p><p>These Saint herbs had strong medicinal power and were all very old.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Bubbles must have gone to some big force to steal medicine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from the Dayan elixir furnace. In the sky above the elixir furnace, the shadow of Nine Dragons danced and circled. It roared at the sky as if the nine Dragons had been reborn.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The lid of the furnace opened, and Lu Ming’s figure flew out. Nine Dragons circled his body, and every inch of his skin glowed with a crystal-like luster. Under the luster, it seemed to be filled with infinite power.</p><p>“A superior-grade heavenly spiritual body!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes bright.</p><p>After a month of continuous tempering, his spiritual body had finally evolved into a superior-grade celestial spiritual body.</p><p>This was already the highest level of a spirit body. His strength had reached an astonishing level.</p><p>Although his cultivation hadn’t changed in the past month, which was still at the minor mastery Supreme Saint realm, his combat strength had increased by a lot.</p><p>with my current combat strength, who can be my match in a battle of the same level? the child of God is known to be invincible among those of the same level. If there’s a chance, I must see it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Then, he stepped out of the mountain of pill furnaces and rushed into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the clouds were pierced through, revealing a passage that was thousands of miles long.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s fists continued to swing. The terrifying fist force swept across and the void boiled. All the air was compressed and exploded, turning into destructive power.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have unlimited energy. He only stopped after half an hour..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
