Once he entered the mountain and river diagram, he would be completely passive and at the mercy of others.</p><p>“Are we going to die Here today?”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and was extremely unwilling.</p><p>In his life, he had experienced many difficulties and dangers. He had experienced ail kinds of dangers and had overcome them one by one. He was not willing to die just like that.</p><p>He wanted to step onto the peak of martial arts!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, the sword fiend shouted coldly. He did not waste any more words and the huge sword in his hand slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This sword could kill an Emperor-to-be in seconds. It was so powerful that it was shocking.</p><p>The sword had yet to reach him, but the terrifying pressure had already made it difficult for Lu Ming to move. The powerful pressure pressed down on Lu Ming’s body, causing his bones to creak as if they were about to break.</p><p>There was no way to block this sword!</p><p>no, I can’t die. I have family and friends who need my protection. My parents need my protection., don’t know where little Qing is now., have to find her, and also Xiangxiang, Mo Li…</p><p>once I die, Qiu Yue will die as well. I can’t die. I want to reach the peak and change my fate …</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and his fighting spirit burst forth.</p><p>Even in a desperate situation, he was unwilling. Even if he was no match, he still wanted to fight.</p><p>Even if he were to die, he would fight to his death!</p><p>His eyes were filled with an unyielding look.</p><p>Unyielding to the sword fiend, unyielding to fate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a sword rang through the nine Heavens.</p><p>Inside the mountain and river diagram, a stone sword directly broke through the barrier of the mountain and river diagram and flew out, floating above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>A terrifying sword light burst out from the stone sword and rushed into the sky. The sword light that the sword fiend had sent down was shattered by the sword light.</p><p>“This is … The celestial Emperor’s sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that the celestial Thearch sword would suddenly rush out and block the other party’s sword at the critical moment.</p><p>“This sword …”</p><p>Jian Sha’s gaze also fell on the celestial Emperor’s sword. For some reason, when he saw the sword, his heart trembled.</p><p>it s a divine sword, a peerless divine sword. If I can get my hands on this sword, my cultivation will instantly break through the shackles and reach the Martial Emperor realm. I might even be able to reach an even higher realm in the future!</p><p>Swordfiend’s eyes glowed with a fiery light.</p><p>He was a sword fiend that had been inadvertently born in rhe Taiyi sword tomb after countless years, and he had intelligence.</p><p>However, his inborn talent was lacking. Unlike the human race, it was extremely difficult for him to advance. It was much more difficult than the human race, the demon race, and the divine beasts.</p><p>He had cultivated arduously for many years and had finally found the opportunity to break through to the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>However, because of Lu Ming, the opportunity to make a breakthrough had become mysterious again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming actually had a peerless divine sword in his hands. He had a feeling that as long as he obtained this peerless divine sword, he would be able to rise up in the future. Even his cultivation speed would soar.</p><p>He had to get this sword.</p><p>kid, you have quite a lot of treasures in your hands. Hand over this sword obediently and I can give you a quick death!</p><p>The sword fiend looked at Lu Ming coldly, but the greed in his eyes could not be concealed.</p><p>“If you let me go, I can give it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he said.</p><p>“Alright, I promise to let you go. Give me the sword!”</p><p>Swordfiend did not hesitate at all and immediately nodded.</p><p>“Do you think I’m stupid? what if you go back on your word? When I get out, I’ll pass it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brat, you’re not qualified to negotiate with me now. If you don’t hand it over, then I’ll take it myself!”</p><p>Jian Sha said coldly. The aura on his body became stronger again, and the giant sword in his hand gave off a terrifying fluctuation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He slashed down with his sword again. This time, the power of his sword was even stronger than before.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The celestial Thearch sword trembled slightly and scattered a sword curtain that enveloped Lu Ming;</p><p>The swordfiend’s sword light slashed at the light screen, but it was like water droplets falling into the ocean. There was no ripple at all, and it disappeared.</p><p>No, it didn’t disappear. It was absorbed by the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword trembled again, emitting a terrifying attractive force.</p><p>Jian Sha’s expression changed. At that moment, he felt a terrifying suction force from the celestial Emperor sword. The huge sword in his hand was about to fly towards the celestial Emperor sword.</p><p>A few of the sword sources even left the giant sword and flew towards the celestial Emperor s sword. They entered the celestial Emperor’s sword and disappeared.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword trembled slightly as if it was very excited. Its attraction became stronger.</p><p>you want to devour my sword source? stop!</p><p>The sword fiend roared. Blood light flowed out from his body continuously and started to burn, causing his strength to increase greatly. He managed to stabilize the huge sword in his hand.</p><p>“Your sword is indeed amazing, bur don’t even think about swallowing my sword source!”</p><p>Jiansha shouted, his eyes as cold as a blade.</p><p>“What if I’m included?”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was not the one who spoke.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming and swordfiend, there was a third person?</p><p>“Luo Xiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thought of Luo Xiang. He spread out his spiritual consciousness and saw that Luo Xiang had opened his eyes. A black-and-white sword was floating above his head.</p><p>That was his sword soul!</p><p>Luo Xiang didn’t die!</p><p>“You’re not dead yet!”</p><p>Swordfiend shrieked.</p><p>“You’re not dead, so how can I die? Devour!”</p><p>Luo Xiang said indifferently. When he said the last word, the huge sword on his back that was stuck in the ground started to shake violently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword hummed and howled. The giant sword emitted a brilliant light and a terrifying suction force enveloped the sword fiend.</p><p>A few sword sources flew out from the giant sword in the sword fiend’s hand and entered the giant sword.</p><p>At this time, the celestial Emperor’s sword also seized the opportunity and burst out with a suction force.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword essence of the giant sword in the sword fiend s hand flew towards the celestial Emperor sword.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword and the giant sword on Luo Xiang’s back simultaneously exploded with a suction force, and the sword fiend finally couldn’t resist.</p><p>To his horror, he couldn’t leave this place even if he wanted to. He found that he couldn’t move his body at all. He was being sucked in by the celestial Emperor s sword and the giant sword on Luo Xiang’s back.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sword source of the giant sword in his hand kept separating and being absorbed by the celestial Emperor sword and the giant sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, two sword sources flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that this seemed to be a gift from the celestial Thearch s sword. He was a little dazed.</p><p>However, the sword sources were good stuff. Lu Ming burst our with the devouring power and absorbed the energy of the two sword sources into his body. He then sat cross-legged and began to refine them..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
