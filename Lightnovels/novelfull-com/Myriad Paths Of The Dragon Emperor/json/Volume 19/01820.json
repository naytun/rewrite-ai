I’ll hold a banquet in two days. I’ll introduce you to the geniuses of the purple flame villa!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>“Alright, if you have something to do, then go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After Ouyang Wushuang had arranged a place for them to stay, he took his leave.</p><p>Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and Long Chen were wandering around the hall. It was their first time in the ancient sun sacred land and they were curious.</p><p>“The only divine temple supports the other Prince? I wonder if I’ll meet Qiu Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The three of them walked around and chatted for a while before returning to their rooms to cultivate.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Two days later, Ouyang Wushuang held a banquet and sent someone to invite the three of them to the banquet.</p><p>When the three of them arrived at a large hall, there were already a few people seated inside.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang sat at the head of the hall. On the left side of the hall, there were eight young men and women. All of them were wearing the same purple clothes with a purple flame embroidered on it.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two’s hearts skipped a beat. They knew that this was the pride of the purple flame villa.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Feng Ling, Long Chen, please take a seat!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang stood up to welcome them while Lu Ming and the other two took their seats.</p><p>everyone, everyone is here. Let me introduce them to you. These are the heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa. This is Xiao Mucheng, and this is…</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang first introduced Lu Ming and the others to the geniuses of the purple flame villa.</p><p>“Nice to meet you!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two stood up and raised their glasses to toast.</p><p>However, the eight heaven’s favorites from the purple flame villa only laughed and did not reply. Their faces were filled with pride.</p><p>This attitude was somewhat disrespectful to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>This made Ouyang Wushuang’s face darken.</p><p>Prince Wushuang, I heard you went to ancient Moon Holy Land to ask for help. Are these the heaven’s favorites you invited?” ye mo asked.</p><p>In the purple flame villa, a young man with a purple flame between his brows spoke. His name was Xiao Mucheng, and he was an extremely powerful heaven’s favorite of the Xiao family in the purple flame villa. His cultivation had reached the great saint perfection realm.</p><p>not bad. These geniuses from ancient Moon Holy Land are extremely talented</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang introduced.</p><p>“Extraordinary talent? How come I’ve never seen him in heavenly Emperor City?”</p><p>Another heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa interrupted Ouyang Wushuang’s words.</p><p>that’s right, we have seen all of the powerful heaven’s favorites from ancient Moon Holy Land in heaven Emperor City. Why don’t we see them?”</p><p>Xiao Mucheng smiled faintly.</p><p>When the news of a great emperor building the yuan mountain sacred Academy spread in heavenly Emperor City, countless geniuses gathered in heavenly Emperor City and clashed with each other. Many geniuses had met each other before. The geniuses from purple flame villa had also been to heavenly Emperor City and met many geniuses from ancient Moon Holy Land. However, they did not know Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Even the heavenly Emperor City did not dare to go, how strong could they be? And he was extremely talented? They obviously didn’t believe him.</p><p>our cultivation was still weak at that time, so we didn’t go to heavenly Emperor City!</p><p>Long Chen said in a deep voice.</p><p>haha, your cultivation is still weak. At least you have some self-awareness!</p><p>his cultivation was weak before. Is he strong now? ”</p><p>I’ve heard that Ouyang Wuji managed to invite the number one genius of the Skywolf tower and the second Prince of the Golden Crow race from the ancient Moon Holy Land. They are all very powerful.</p><p>A few of the purple flame villa’s geniuses mocked him.</p><p>This made Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and Long Chen’s faces turn cold.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s face was also ugly. He waved his hand and said,” “Alright, since you’re all here to help me, you should work together and not fight among yourselves!” He said.</p><p>Prince Wushuang, we are doing this for your own good. I hope these people will be of some use!</p><p>Xiao Mucheng sneered, with a faint sense of disdain.</p><p>After that, the atmosphere became a little awkward. Everyone drank a few cups and then left unhappily.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry!”</p><p>After the people from the purple flame villa left, Ouyang Wushuang felt a little apologetic.</p><p>it’s normal for people from big forces to have their eyes on the top of their heads. I just don’t know if they have the corresponding strength!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>the heaven’s favorites of the purple flame villa are quite strong. Maybe I’ve never seen you guys before, so I’m a little proud …</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang explained.</p><p>“I hope so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and bade farewell to Ouyang Wushuang. He returned to his residence with Feng Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang sighed and felt a headache.</p><p>However, he was still biased towards the purple flame villa. Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and Long Chen had great potential, but their cultivation levels were still weak.</p><p>This test mainly relied on the talents of the purple flame villa, Lu Ming, and a few others to assist.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two returned to their residence and made an appointment to visit the divine origin imperial capital the next day.</p><p>The next morning, the three of them headed outside.</p><p>The three of them had Ouyang Wushuang’s token, so they were naturally unimpeded.</p><p>The divine origin imperial capital had been passed down for countless years. It was vast and boundless. All sorts of ancient buildings soared into the sky. From afar, it was extremely spectacular.</p><p>Even though it had just experienced internal strife, the divine origin imperial capital had basically returned to normal. Shops lined both sides of the streets, and martial Dao powerhouses were streaming in endlessly.</p><p>The three of them didn’t have a goal in mind and just wandered around. They bought whatever they needed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s wrong?”</p><p>As they walked, Huang Ling and Long Chen realized that something was wrong with Lu Ming. Lu Ming suddenly stopped and looked ahead without blinking.</p><p>They followed Lu Ming’s gaze and saw a woman in front of them. She was out of this world.</p><p>This woman had a slender and graceful figure. She wore a long dress and had an otherworldly temperament. She was like a goddess from the legends, a fairy from heaven. Even in the vast crowd, she could attract everyone’s attention and become the center of attention.</p><p>This woman’s appearance wasn’t any worse than Huang Ling’s.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming is lecherous. He can’t move when he sees a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Bubbles mumbled as she sat on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen were a little surprised. Although the lady was like a goddess, they knew Lu Ming well enough to know that he was not such a person.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming seemed to have not heard bubbles, Feng Ling, and the rest. There was only one person in his eyes, the lady who was as white as snow.</p><p>Qiu Yue!</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that after so many years, he would meet Qiu Yue again on the streets of this house.</p><p>It had been more than ten years since Qiu Yue had been taken away by the only expert from the divine temple. It had been more than ten years since they had last seen each other, but Qiu Yue was still as beautiful as before, except that she had matured a little and her temperament had become more otherworldly.</p><p>For more than ten years, in the vast Yuan continent, Lu Ming did not know where to look for Qiu Yue.</p><p>All these years, especially Lu Ming’s parents, they had been thinking about Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue could be said to have grown up with Lu Ming. Li Ping and her husband had almost treated Qiu Yue as half a daughter.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main purpose in coming to the ancient sun sacred land was to find Qiu Yue.</p><p>However, he did not expect to achieve this goal so easily..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
