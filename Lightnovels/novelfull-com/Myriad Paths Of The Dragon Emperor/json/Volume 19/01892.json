Without a word, they charged at the crowd.</p><p>tn the end, more than a hundred people stepped out. They were all strong, and most of them were absolute Saints. They were fearless and very difficult to deal with.</p><p>...</p><p>The scene fell into chaos.</p><p>these people are just walking corpses. Let’s join forces and kill them!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>There were at least 300 to 400 people who had come to this place, and they were all experts. They joined forces, several against one, and killed the people who had come otn of the abyss.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming saw a person and he was shocked.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming actually knew one of them.</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect!</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected to see the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect here.</p><p>Back in the Azure region, they had been ambushed by evil spirit and had broken out of the encirclement together. The life and death Sword sect’s main gate had brought Luo Xiang and successfully broken out of the encirclement, but who would have thought that they would appear in the sword tomb.</p><p>Moreover, the sect leader was the same as those who had walked out of the abyss. He had completely lost his mind and his eyes were empty. All that was left was his cultivation and combat power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The life-death Sword sect leader’s life-death Sword technique was extremely terrifying. With one strike, an absolute Saint realm master’s forehead was pierced.</p><p>“Junior Brother, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>An old man roared and charged at the sect leader.</p><p>This person was at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. With one strike, he destroyed the sect leader’s attack. The battle blade didn’t stop and continued to attack the sect leader.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch, sending the man’s saber flying.</p><p>“What are you doing? This person is crazy and has no spiritual intelligence!”</p><p>That person shouted.</p><p>“I’ll deal with it!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said indifferently. The absolute Saint at the peak was very afraid of Lu Ming, lie gritted his teeth and left, killing the other people who had walked out of the abyss.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect attacked again. The sword light pierced through the air, and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect was at the mastery of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and destroyed the sword gleam of the life – and-death Sword sect leader.</p><p>“Senior, wake up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Ills voice rumbled like thunder, blasting into the head of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect did not seem to notice anything and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the other party’s attack and shouted continuously. However, the other party did not react at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this person’s soul seems to have been destroyed!”</p><p>Qiu Yue appeared beside Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect used to have a good relationship with Dragon God Valley. They had fought together against an enemy. Lu Ming really did not want to see the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect fall, but it was a pity that there was nothing he could do to reverse the situation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is this someone you know? However, the other party has indeed fallen. If you can’t bear it, you can give it to someone else!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Fie and Qiu Yue retreated at top speed and attacked the other people who walked out of the abyss.</p><p>As for the sect leader, he continued to attack the others. However, there were more people outside. Soon, the sect leader was surrounded by a few Masters. His body exploded and he fell into the abyss.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He was the master of a sect in the Azure continent, an Overlord of a region. After leaving the Azure continent, he had ended up in such a state.</p><p>He had escaped from evil spirit, but he had ultimately fallen here.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of Luo Xiang, who was with the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect. How was he?</p><p>He was an upright person and also a terrifying heaven’s favorite. He had stayed in the same realm and nurtured his sword soul for 15 years. No one knew what kind of achievements he would have in the future.</p><p>Had he also fallen?</p><p>Lu Ming s thoughts were running wild, but he did not stop his attacks. He killed two people who walked out of the abyss in succession.</p><p>Those who walked out of the abyss were few in number and were eventually surrounded and annihilated one by one.</p><p>However, these people were very strong and fearless. The people outside had also paid a heavy price. About a hundred people were killed, and their blood dyed the ground red.</p><p>When the last person who walked out of the abyss was killed, everyone’s eyes turned back to the abyss.</p><p>Was there anyone else in the abyss?</p><p>Why did those people look like zombies? were they being controlled?</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered with various thoughts.</p><p>However, no one dared to go up and seize the sword source.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh …</p><p>At this moment, the sword sources gathered together and flew down toward the abyss.</p><p>Ln less than a minute, the endless sword source flew into the abyss and disappeared.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>All the sword sources had flown into the abyss. What should he do? Should he go down?</p><p>However, the abyss was extremely mysterious and terrifying.</p><p>Earlier, more than a hundred experts had walked out of the abyss. All of them had lost their spiritual intelligence and were like walking corpses, only knowing how to kill.</p><p>What was in the abyss?</p><p>Was there a treasure that attracted the sword source, or was there some kind of danger?</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, all thinking that the others would go down first to explore the way, and if there was danger, they could retreat in time.</p><p>Everyone was thinking the same thing, so who would take the lead?</p><p>After a moment of silence, someone finally spoke.</p><p>“Everyone, we can’t go on like this. Why don’t we join forces and go down to explore?”</p><p>A purple-robed elder suggested.</p><p>alright, I agree. Rather than this stalemate, why don’t we join forces and explore!</p><p>A tall and sturdy man said.</p><p>good. If you want to go down, take a few steps forward. If you don’t want to go down, retreat. We won’t force you!</p><p>The purple-robed elder spoke and stepped forward first. Then, the brawny man also stepped forward.</p><p>Some people muttered to themselves for a moment before stepping forward as well.</p><p>The endless sword source was an irresistible temptation. If he could get a part of it, his cultivation would definitely improve quickly.</p><p>This was especially so for those who cultivated the sword. Not only could they increase their cultivation, but they could also temper their sword techniques and increase their comprehension of the laws of rhe sword.</p><p>Even if it was dangerous, it was worth it.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also stepped forward.</p><p>The astral treasure Lotus had escaped into the abyss. No matter what, they had to go down and find it. Otherwise, they didn’t know when they would be able to find it.</p><p>However, not everyone wanted to go down and take a look. Some of them shook their heads and took a few steps back.</p><p>The abyss was too strange, and no one could predict what dangers there would be. If they lost their lives, what was the use of getting the source of the sword?</p><p>However, the number of people who retreated was small. More people planned to go down and explore.</p><p>“Everyone, those who don’t want to go down, let them stay here forever!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the purple-robed elder’s eyes as he sent a message to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Someone’s eyes flashed as he asked.</p><p>“These people who don’t want to go down have unfathomable motives. Most likely, they want us to go down first to explore the way. Who knows if they will go down after we go down? Flow can there be such a good deal in this world!” also, some people are probably waiting for us to come out before launching a sneak attack on us. If we get injured, we ll be killed by these rats. That’s why we can’t let these people live!</p><p>The purple-robed elder continued to transmit his voice..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
