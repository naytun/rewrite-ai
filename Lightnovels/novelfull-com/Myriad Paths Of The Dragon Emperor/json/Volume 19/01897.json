The Saint power slowly grew and surged into Lu Ming’s limbs and bones. His injuries began to recover.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other side, Luo Xiang’s situation was very similar to Lu Ming’s. The giant sword would actually split out a sword source and fly towards Luo Xiang, which was then absorbed by his sword soul. Luo Xiang sat there cross-legged, motionless, like an old monk in meditation, concentrating on his cultivation.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>The sword fiend howled and continued to explode out. He wanted to resist but it was useless. He could not move at all.</p><p>He seemed to be restrained, and as the sword source on the giant sword in his hand was continuously drawn away, his ability to resist was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>However, there were too many sword sources on the giant sword. It was endless and could not be absorbed in a short time.</p><p>Time passed by quickly, day after day.</p><p>Given the strength of Lu Ming’s spirit body, his injuries were fully healed after a day. He then used the power of the sword source to temper his vital essence and increase his cultivation.</p><p>Every time the energy of the sword source was refined, another two sword sources would fly to him and be devoured and refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s cultivation grew stronger and closer to an absolute Saint.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>In three months, the endless sword source in the sword fiend’s hands had almost been completely absorbed by the celestial Emperor’s sword and that huge sword.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had also refined many sword sources. His cultivation had reached the limit of the Supreme Saint realm and was very close to the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>It was not that easy to break through to the absolute Saint realm. Although Lu Ming had refined many sword sources during this period of time, he still had not broken through. He needed an opportunity.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already very satisfied.</p><p>It was very difficult for a great saint to break through to an absolute Saint. It required a long time of accumulation. Without enough accumulation, it was difficult to advance.</p><p>Take Qiu Yue for example. When Lu Ming first met her, Qiu Yue was already a perfected great saint. However, she had not broken through to the absolute Saint realm. This was because she was accumulating her strength.</p><p>Only after accumulating to a certain level would one be able to break through.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Lu Ming would not have been able to break through to the absolute Saint realm without a few years of accumulation, considering that he had cultivated two Saint hearts.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had accumulated a few years ‘worth of experience in just three months.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword had absorbed a large amount of sword source. There was a layer of faint white light on it, which looked extremely mysterious.</p><p>The huge sword behind Luo Xiang also emitted a dazzling sword light with many mysterious patterns moving on it.</p><p>“No, no, I’m not willing …”</p><p>Jian Sha muttered to himself. At this moment, his aura was extremely dispirited and he was extremely weak.</p><p>When the last sword source was absorbed, the celestial Emperor sword shook and all its aura was retracted. It transformed back into an ordinary stone sword and flew into Lu Ming’s glabella, floating in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>With a single thought, the celestial Emperor’s sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. However, after Lu Ming infused his Saint energy into it, he realized that it was like a stone sinking into the sea. There was no reaction at all from the celestial Emperor’s sword.</p><p>“Is this really the celestial Emperor’s sword? I can’t even unleash its full power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He kept the celestial Emperor’s sword back into his sea of consciousness.</p><p>At this moment, the giant sword on Luo Xiang’s back started to shake as if it was going to break out of the ground. The light on the sword became even more brilliant, and a more powerful suction force enveloped the sword fiend.</p><p>The sword fiend revealed a terrified expression and shouted,” “No, don’t!”</p><p>He struggled madly, but it was all in vain. His body flew towards the giant sword and sank into it, disappearing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The huge sword buzzed, and the entire Valley shook violently.</p><p>Lu Ming flew out of the deep pit and stood in the air to observe from a distance.</p><p>The huge sword trembled more and more violently. Finally, it rushed out of the ground and flew into the sky. After flying in a circle in the sky, it directly rushed towards Luo Xiang. When it got close to Luo Xiang’s body, it became smaller and smaller, and then it disappeared into Luo Xiang’s glabella.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang opened his eyes, and a powerful aura emanated from him.</p><p>“Great sage Great Perfection!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Luo Xiang’s cultivation base had also reached the great saint in the Great Perfection realm. It seemed that Luo Xiang had also obtained a great opportunity because of this giant sword.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered that Luo Xiang’s spirit body was extraordinary. It had actually evolved to the level of a medium-grade heaven spirit body.</p><p>When Lu Ming first met Luo Xiang, his spirit body was only a low-grade Earth Spirit body.</p><p>fifteen years of nurturing the sword soul. It’s indeed not simple!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had long felt that Luo Xiang wasn’t simple. He had already mastered the law of speed, which was one of the king path laws. Now that his cultivation had reached the great saint perfection, he had obtained that giant sword, and cultivated the wonderful sword soul. His combat power was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Luo Xiang stood up and looked at Lu Ming with a smile on his face.”Lu Ming, long time no see. 1 didn’t expect to meet you here after we parted at the Azure continent!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to see you here either. What’s going on between you two? Also, your master, he…”</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming stopped and sighed.</p><p>“My master, he must have fallen!”</p><p>Luo Xiang said with a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>“He seems to have lost his intelligence. His soul is no longer there.” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“His soul was destroyed by the sword fiend!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s leave this place first. We’ll talk as we walk!” Luo Xiang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, together with Luo Xiang, they soared into the sky and flew up to the abyss. They then flew towards the exit of the sword tomb.</p><p>They didn’t encounter any accidents along the way. Soon, they flew out of the sword tomb and into the distance.</p><p>On the way, Luo Xiang told Lu Ming about their encounter after they escaped from the Azure region.</p><p>After they escaped from the Cang state, they did not reach the ancient Moon Holy Land. Instead, they followed a caravan and took a teleportation array to the vicinity of the Taiyi sword tomb.</p><p>Later on, Luo Xiang followed the life and death Sword sect’s sect leader to the sword tomb to cultivate and accidentally stumbled into this abyss.</p><p>The swordfiend had been planning to attract other martial artists here. He wanted to use the blood of the other martial artists as a sacrifice to the sword. With the energy of the sword source, he would be able to break through to the Martial Emperor realm in one go.</p><p>Therefore, the sword fiend split out the soul of the sword fiend and destroyed the soul of the life-and-death Sword sect leader, controlling him.</p><p>Because Luo Xiang had a sword soul, he had the protection of that huge sword.</p><p>Moreover, Luo Xiang cultivated a sword soul, which was used to destroy the soul of the sword fiend.</p><p>So previously, sword fiend thought that Luo Xiang had died, but in fact, Luo Xiang didn’t die. Instead, he formed a connection with the giant sword.</p><p>However, with his strength alone, it was impossible for him to be the sword fiend’s opponent. In the end, the celestial Emperor’s sword appeared and exploded with a strong power to attract the sword fiend. Only then did Luo Xiang take action, cooperating with the giant sword to attack the sword fiend.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization and finally understood the cause and effect.</p><p>Luo Xiang could also be considered to have profited from this misfortune and obtained a great fortuitous encounter. Unfortunately, the death of the life-and-death Sword sect’s sect master made him quite sad.</p><p>The two of them flew more than a hundred thousand miles away and landed on a mountain peak. Lu Ming summoned Qiu Yue from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Qiu Yue had just come out and was very surprised. Lu Ming explained what had happened earlier..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
