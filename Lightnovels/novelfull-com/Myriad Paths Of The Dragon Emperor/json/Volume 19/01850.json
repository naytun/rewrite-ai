He stopped and turned to look at Qiu Yue. His face darkened and he said coldly,” “Didn’t you hear what I just said?”</p><p>...</p><p>Qiu Yue did not seem to see the skinny middle-aged man or hear his words.</p><p>She was drinking by herself, and so was Lu Ming.</p><p>They completely ignored the thin middle-aged man.</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man’s face turned even colder. He said,” you probably don’t know my background. Let me tell you, I’m from the HA family. My young master is hamenti of the HA family, the No. 1 heaven’s favorite in barren city. Now, come with me!</p><p>When he mentioned the HA clan, the skinny middle-aged man had a smug look on his face, as if the HA clan was very powerful.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>However, the only reply he got was a cold voice from Qiu Yue.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man shouted, bursting with cold killing intent.</p><p>This woman actually dared to tell him to get lost after hearing his name. She was simply courting death.</p><p>In barren city, who didn’t know about the HA family?</p><p>The HA family was the most powerful force in barren city. Hamenti was the No. 1 genius in barren city, and hamenti’s father was the No. 1 master in barren city. In barren city, no one dared to disrespect the HA family.</p><p>But this woman actually told him to get lost?</p><p>“If you don’t want to go over, I’ll take you over!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man shouted coldly in an overbearing manner. He stepped forward and his skinny hand reached for Qiu Yue’s neck. He wanted to drag Qiu Yue to hamerte.</p><p>However, before his palm could reach Qiu Yue’s neck, his entire body froze. Then, his arm was covered in a layer of ice crystals, completely sealing his arm in ice.</p><p>Furthermore, the ice crystals quickly spread from his arm to his entire body.</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man revealed a look of fear and quickly retreated. With a miserable scream, his arm shattered like a piece of ice.</p><p>“My arm!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man let out a shrill scream.</p><p>The restaurant suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The other people who were eating and drinking looked at Qiu Yue in surprise.</p><p>where did such a young expert come from? ha Gou has the cultivation of an initial bright Saint, but one of his arms has been crippled without him knowing!</p><p>newborn calves are not afraid of Tigers. This time, Hamilton is going to flip out. He won’t let them off!</p><p>that’s right. Hamilton is barren city’s number one prodigy. He has a low-class heavenly spiritual body and has already reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. That woman is in trouble. It’s a pity that she lost such a beautiful face!</p><p>Many people were discussing, but they kept their voices low as if they were afraid that Hamilton would hear them.</p><p>As expected, the young man, Hamilton, suddenly stood up. He was full of cold killing intent as he stepped toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“It seems that you’ve never heard of my name? Do you know the consequences of hurting my ha family?”</p><p>Hammerte said coldly.</p><p>what Bullsh * t ha family? it seems that you don’t understand human language. 1 just told you to ‘get lost’, didn’t you hear me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He did not even look at Hamilton and poured himself and Qiu Yue a glass of wine.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Hamilton’s face darkened. At the same time, a terrifying killing intent burst forth from him. He glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>In the barren city, no one had ever dared to talk to him like this. Even the senior experts of the other forces had to give him face for the sake of his father.</p><p>Now, a kid who came out of nowhere dared to insult the HA family and him. He wanted to make Lu Ming regret it and kneel on the ground to beg him.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant also felt their hearts tremble. They all thought that the young man was finished. He actually dared to say such things about hammerty. His end would be extremely miserable.</p><p>“Brat, 1’11 make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Hamilton’s face. He took a step forward and moved like the wind, appearing beside Lu Ming. He swung his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to see it. He picked up a piece of meat with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. When he saw that Hamilton’s palm was about to hit his face, his chopsticks stabbed out like lightning.</p><p>A shrill scream resounded through the restaurant. It was from hammerty.</p><p>One of his palms had been pierced by Lu Ming’s chopsticks.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of minced meat. It seemed to have turned into the most terrifying hidden weapon and hit Hamilton’s face.</p><p>The laws and holy power that covered his body were as fragile as tofu. The minced meat penetrated through hammerty’s defense and created tiny bloody holes in his face.</p><p>Hammerte retreated crazily, screeching miserably. His face was covered in blood, which made him look ferocious.</p><p>The others in the restaurant gasped.</p><p>They were shocked by Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>Hammerte was barren city’s number one genius. He had a low-tier heavenly spiritual body and his cultivation had reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. In barren city, among the younger generation, no one could withstand one move from him.</p><p>However, he was completely helpless in front of Lu Ming and was completely crushed by him.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t look very old and belonged to the younger generation.</p><p>Could he be a heaven’s favorite from outside barren city?</p><p>“Die! I want you to die!”</p><p>Hammerte shouted crazily.</p><p>“Blowing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and slapped across the air.</p><p>A palm condensed with holy power slapped hamerty’s face across the air, sending him flying out of the restaurant.</p><p>In the restaurant, the thin middle-aged man and Hamilton’s other lackeys were pale and stunned.</p><p>“Get lost. If there’s a next time, kill without mercy!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the skinny middle-aged man and the rest as he spoke coldly.</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man and the others felt as if they had been granted Amnesty. They rushed out of the restaurant in a hurry and escaped.</p><p>you two, you’d better run. The HA family won’t let you off for treating hammerty like this!</p><p>At this moment, a white-haired old man walked over and kindly reminded.</p><p>“Senior, how’s the strength of this ha family?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and asked.</p><p>there are seven most powerful forces in barren city, and the HA family is the most powerful one. It is said that hammerty’s father has reached the Emperor-to-be realm, and is the most powerful master in barren city!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Emperor-to-be realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, but his expression did not change.</p><p>With bubble’s current strength and the profoundness of the space-time law, they might be able to escape from an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>As long as there were no Emperor-level powerhouses, Lu Ming was not very worried.</p><p>senior, there’s something 1 would like to ask you. Do you know of the ancient Savage barren realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He had come here to search for the savage barren ancient realm, and this was the perfect time to ask.</p><p>“Ancient Savage barren realm? In barren city, the savage barren ancient land is also a legend. It is said that there are endless treasures in there. The major forces in barren city have been looking for it, but after countless years, no one has found it!”</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>“No one found it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked disappointed.</p><p>The major forces in barren city had failed to find it after so many years. The hope of finding it was slim.</p><p>you two, you should leave quickly. Ha clan is not far from here. I’m afraid the experts of ha clan will arrive soon!</p><p>The old man reminded again.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
