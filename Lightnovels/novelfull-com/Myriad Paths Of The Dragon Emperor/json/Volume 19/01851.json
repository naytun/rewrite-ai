If an Emperor-to-be didn’t come, he could easily escape.</p><p>...</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had no intention of leaving, the old man sighed and turned to leave.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant were the same. They were afraid that they would be implicated when the experts of the HA family arrived.</p><p>After a while, only Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were left in the restaurant.</p><p>The two of them ate and drank.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>It didn’t take long before a terrifying aura came from outside. The entire restaurant was surrounded by the power of laws and completely blocked.</p><p>“Brat, get out here!”</p><p>Outside, hammerty’s roar could be heard.</p><p>two great saints in the great circle, two in the initial absolute Saint realm, and one in the late absolute Saint realm!</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>The other party was quite generous. They had sent three absolute Saints all at once.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about the initial absolute Saint realm at all. Even if it was the great mastery absolute Saint realm, it could only cause Lu Ming a little trouble.</p><p>“Qiuyue, how about going out to kill people?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Qiu Yue was even more direct. She stood up and stepped out.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. Qiu Yue’s personality seemed to have changed after she lost her memory. She was not so decisive in the past.</p><p>When the two of them left the restaurant, they saw that in the sky, Hamilton had sealed off the area with five great experts.</p><p>“Little brat, very good, you haven’t left!”</p><p>Hamilton looked at Lu Ming with a ferocious expression. He wished he could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces. Then, he looked at Qiu Yue and said coldly, b * tch, 1’11 make you my slave and play with you every day. When I’m done, I’ll give you to my subordinates. Hahaha!</p><p>After saying that, hammerty laughed crazily.</p><p>“I said before that if there’s a next time, I’ll kill you without mercy. It seems like you’re tired of living!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze darkened.</p><p>“You’re so full of yourself, I’ll cripple you first!”</p><p>A strong middle-aged man stepped out, his Iron Fist as heavy as a mountain, aiming for Lu Ming.</p><p>This person had the cultivation of a great saint in the exceptional realm. With a single punch, the heavens and earth rumbled. The force of the punch was extremely terrifying and was about to drown Lu Ming.</p><p>In the distance, many onlookers were shaking their heads. They all thought that Lu Ming was in grave danger.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heavens and earth rumbled as a nine-headed Dragon pounced out. The Dragon’s Roar suppressed the heavens, and the dragon’s claws swiped out, crushing the fist force of the opponent. The Dragon’s body did not stop as it stomped down with its claws.</p><p>The brawny man screamed as he was torn apart by the nine Dragons and died on the spot.</p><p>This was the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. Lu Ming had not used it for a long time. At his current realm, the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was not enough. However, it was more than enough to deal with an ordinary great sage in the exceptional realm.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>He killed a great sage in the great circle with one move. What kind of strength was this?</p><p>Furthermore, he was so young. This was too terrifying.</p><p>Hammerte was known as the number one prodigy in barren city. However, he was nothing compared to Lu Ming.</p><p>Hamilton himself was stunned. He looked terrified. With Lu Ming’s abilities, it was easy for him to kill him previously.</p><p>But soon after, his heart was filled with even stronger killing intent and jealousy.</p><p>In the past, he had dominated the barren city’s younger generation and was very proud. He thought that there were not many geniuses in the world who could compare to him. Now, seeing how powerful Lu Ming was, he was deeply envious.</p><p>“Kill, kill him!”</p><p>Roared hammerte.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure rushed out from behind hamerty. A terrifying aura burst forth, pressing down on Lu Ming like a wild mountain.</p><p>He was an absolute Saint.</p><p>An absolute Saint was astonishingly powerful. They were far from being comparable to a Supreme Saint. They could kill a Supreme Saint with a flip of their hand.</p><p>In the Azure state, an absolute Saint was an Overlord of a region. There were not many absolute Saints in a top power.</p><p>Light spots lit up on Lu Ming’s body, and holy weapons appeared one after another.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The divine sword technique burst out and rushed into the other party’s body. The other party’s body shook slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void, holding an absolute holy weapon sword in his hand, and slashed.</p><p>A flash of sword light cut through the void, as if it was splitting the heaven and earth. The power was so strong that it made everyone’s expression change.</p><p>The absolute saint’s expression changed drastically. He used all his power and shot out beams of divine light at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, as the Battle Sword passed by, all the divine light was cut apart. The Battle Sword did not stop and continued to slash down.</p><p>With a scream, half of the absolute saint’s body was cut off by Lu Ming.</p><p>The man was terrified and retreated frantically, trying to escape.</p><p>“Can you escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming attacked coldly. The combat sword in his hand shot out like lightning and pierced through the man’s head, destroying his soul.</p><p>The absolute Saint had fallen.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air and felt their scalps tingle. Lu Ming’s combat strength was simply terrifying. Even an absolute Saint had been killed so easily. Was he still human?</p><p>Hammerte was completely stunned. His eyes were wide open, and he looked at the scene in disbelief, as if he was dreaming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to move forward. He activated the chaotic finger of tribulation and pointed.</p><p>A giant finger of chaos tribulation pointed at another absolute Saint.</p><p>When Lu Ming was in the great sage lower tier, he could defeat an ordinary absolute Saint lower tier. Now that he had broken through to the great sage upper tier, it was not too difficult to kill an absolute Saint lower tier.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming had killed an absolute Saint in a few moves. The absolute Saint didn’t dare to take it head-on. He retreated quickly, trying to avoid Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue’s body flashed out, and the laws of yin and yang exploded. Two curved blades flew out, forming a terrifying destructive power that enveloped the absolute Saint.</p><p>The absolute Saint didn’t even have time to scream before he was reduced to ashes by the power of destruction.</p><p>Another one had died, and this time, it was Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>run! the only absolute Saint in the upper tier roared. He didn’t dare to stay any longer. He used his Saint power to run away.</p><p>“Come and go as you please, how can it be that easy?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He turned into a ray of light and chased after hamerty.</p><p>With hammerty’s personality, he would not give up just like that. There would be endless trouble later on, so he might as well kill him directly.</p><p>Qiu Yue followed closely behind.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded, as if they were in a dream.</p><p>In the beginning, Hamilton had been aggressive. He had brought three absolute Saints with him to kill Lu Ming and take Qiu Yue.</p><p>But now, two of the three absolute Saints had died, and the remaining one was running away with Hamilton.</p><p>This result was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many people followed closely behind them, wanting to see the final result. Hammerty, the Lord who had been lawless in barren city, what would happen today?</p><p>The absolute Saint expert took hamenti and fled frantically. His speed was amazing, and he flew over the barren city like a beam of light.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, I’ll definitely ask my father to kill them. No, i’ll make them beg for death!”</p><p>Hamilton roared in his heart. His face was twisted..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
