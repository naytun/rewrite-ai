As the number one Holy Land of the yuan mountain, it had gathered countless strong cultivators.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other hand, the platform where the celestial Emperor’s sword was located had lost its former liveliness. Ever since the celestial Emperor’s sword was pulled out by Lu Ming, no one was interested in it anymore.</p><p>A young man stood in the air above the platform.</p><p>This young man was dressed in snow-white clothes, shoes, and socks. His black hair was loose, and his eyes were as dazzling as two stars.</p><p>At this moment, the young man was emitting a terrifying aura as he stared at the platform.</p><p>“When did the celestial Emperor’s sword get pulled out?”</p><p>The young man said, his voice cold.</p><p>Beside the young man, there was an old man with gloomy eyes. “About five months ago!” He replied.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The young man continued to ask.</p><p>this person controls the Laws of Chaos and is a very Young heaven’s pride expert. We’ve sent people to investigate. He’s a heaven’s pride expert from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. His name is Lu Ming!</p><p>The old man replied.</p><p>“The Laws of Chaos! Lu Ming, Hmph, how dare you take away my sword from the Galaxy. You really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>The killing intent in the young man’s eyes grew stronger.</p><p>So he was the number one genius on the Saint King ranking, the eternal Son, Xing Chen.</p><p>however, that kid is also smart. After taking the celestial Emperor’s sword, he disappeared. We have used various methods to find out that the kid has not been in the yuan mountain sacred Academy during this period of time. He should have gone out to train!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Hmph, unless he never returns to the yuan mountain sacred Academy, my sword will always be mine!”</p><p>Xing Chen snorted coldly, then turned around and left.</p><p>In a Citadel outside the heavenly Emperor City, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and Luo Xiang stepped out of the teleportation formation.</p><p>They had to travel for half a month before they reached the nearest teleportation area. Then, they returned to the guard city of the heavenly Emperor City through the teleportation array.</p><p>After they got out of the teleportation array, they rose into the air and flew towards heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Of course, Luo Xiang wasn’t a disciple of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, so he was naturally stopped. However, with his talent, he easily passed the test and became a member of the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>As soon as he entered the yuan mountain sacred Institute, Lu Ming realized that the sacred Institute was much livelier than before.</p><p>In the past, many people had been cultivating in seclusion in various cultivation places of the sacred Institute. But now, it seemed that many people had come out of seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. Not long after, they arrived at the Saint King ranking.</p><p>“The number of people on the Saint King ranking has increased by a lot!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Previously, there were only about forty people on the Saint King ranking. Now, there were more than eighty people. It was double the number.</p><p>It was obvious that many people had broken through to the absolute Saint realm during this period of time.</p><p>They were improving, and so were others.</p><p>Therefore, in a competition between geniuses, once one was at a standstill, one would be quickly surpassed by others.</p><p>“So many absolute Saints!”</p><p>Luo Xiang’s eyes were bright, revealing his battle intent.</p><p>The three of them didn’t stay for long. After a glance, they flew back to their residence.</p><p>When he returned to his residence, he found that everyone was there.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, desolate li, and the others were all gathered together.</p><p>“You guys didn’t go into closed-door cultivation?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve returned just in time. The great emperor will be giving a lecture tomorrow. If you’d returned a day later, you wouldn’t have made it!”</p><p>Huang Ling smiled.</p><p>“The great Emperor’s lecture, it seems my luck is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lady Qiuyue … Has she recovered her memory?”</p><p>Huang Ling looked at Qiu Yue with a complicated expression.</p><p>hmm, I was lucky this time. I found the materials 1 needed and made the soul recovery pill. Qiu Yue’s memory has been restored!</p><p>Lu Ming said. Everyone came forward to congratulate him.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming introduced Luo Xiang to everyone.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard that you pulled out the celestial Emperor’s sword. Is that true?”</p><p>Long Chen suddenly said.</p><p>“Not bad!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>you have to be careful. Some time ago, the Heng family has been sending people to find out about you. I heard that the Heng Xing River has already announced that the celestial Emperor’s sword will be his personal sword. Now that the great emperor is giving a lecture, many geniuses have come out of seclusion. The Heng Xing River has also come out of seclusion.</p><p>Long Chen said with a frown.</p><p>you’re afraid that the star River will find trouble with me. It’s fine. At most, I’ll just put the celestial Emperor’s sword back in and see if he can pull it out!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>“Good idea, hahaha!”</p><p>Desolate li laughed as well.</p><p>Some of them were in seclusion, while others were out traveling. They had not seen each other for a long time, so naturally, there were many topics to talk about. Some people even started sparring on the spot, which was quite lively.</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next day was the day of the great Emperor’s Dao lecture.</p><p>Two months ago, the date for the Dao lecture was set. During this period of time, almost all the geniuses had exited their seclusion. It could be said to be the most lively day in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others flew towards the highest peak in the depths of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. The great Emperor’s Dao lecture would be held at the peak of this mountain.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was a piece of flat land. It was very wide and open. On the flat land, there were more than ten thousand futons.</p><p>At the forefront of the flat land, there was an ordinary-looking old man in a gray robe. He was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.</p><p>Many people had already taken their seats on the praying mats, but there was no sound at all. Everyone was holding their breath and concentrating.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived and looked at the old man, they felt a chili in their hearts.</p><p>The old man looked very ordinary, but the seat he was sitting on was the seat for preaching.</p><p>The one giving the lecture today was a great emperor. Needless to say, the old man was a great emperor.</p><p>The yuan mountain sacred Academy was established by three great emperors. However, the great emperors were extremely elusive. After everyone joined the yuan mountain sacred Academy, they had yet to meet the great emperor. Was it finally possible for them to meet one?</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest held their breath and sat down on some futons at random.</p><p>Next, more and more geniuses arrived.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt an icy cold aura enveloping him. He turned around and saw a group of paragons approaching.</p><p>Among them, he saw Luo pokong, but he wasn’t at the forefront. There was another young man in front of him.</p><p>The man’s face was cold and his eyes were shining with a faint sense of pride as he looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Young master, that’s Luo cangqiong!”</p><p>Qiu Yue sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a murderous intent.</p><p>“Kid, Qiu Yue is mine. If you’re smart, you’d better get lost. If you don’t, you’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Of course, he was using voice transmission. With the great sovereign here, no matter how lawless Luo cangqiong was, he didn’t dare to make a loud noise.</p><p>“Wishful thinking!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently, revealing a faint look of disdain.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent. He glanced at Qiu Yue and said no more. He stepped forward and walked to the front row of praying mats..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
