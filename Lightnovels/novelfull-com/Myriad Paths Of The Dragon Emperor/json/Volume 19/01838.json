Ancient Moon Holy Land was close to the South, and the southernmost part was the endless sea.</p><p>...</p><p>The ancient yang sacred land was close to the North, and if one kept going up, they would reach the land of ten thousand demons, one of the ten lands of the primordial realm.</p><p>The land of myriad demons was a Holy Land for demonic cultivators. It was filled with countless demonic cultivators, and there were even ancient demon clans. Its overall strength was even stronger than the yuan mountain.</p><p>After flying for half a day, a faint demonic Qi began to appear in the world.</p><p>This place was already at the border between the yuan mountain and the land of myriad Devils.</p><p>At this moment, the warship stopped.</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily, they didn’t enter the land of myriad demons.</p><p>There were countless demonic cultivators in the land of infinite demons, and there were even ancient demons. They were very powerful. If they went in, they would be in great danger. If they met those ancient demons, they would be killed immediately.</p><p>there’s a sect up ahead called the blood soul sect. Their cultivation methods are brutal, and they secretly use the blood and souls of ordinary people to cultivate. Countless ordinary people have died at their hands!</p><p>however, this sect isn’t very strong. The strongest are the absolute Saints in the Great Perfection realm. There are also some experts in the initial perfection realm. Previously, we had Emperor-ranked experts who secretly infiltrated this sect and left a mark on twelve of them. Your mission is to obtain these marks, regardless of the method you use!</p><p>An old man explained. With a wave of his hand, crystal balls appeared in the air. Then, these crystal balls flew towards everyone, one for each person.</p><p>take this crystal ball. As long as you’re within 1000 meters, you’ll be able to sense the existence of the mark. Moreover, as long as you kill the person with the mark, the crystal ball will automatically absorb the mark. Remember, only the person who kills the person can obtain the mark. Whoever kills the person will obtain it. In the end, whoever obtains the most marks will win!</p><p>The old man continued to explain.</p><p>“A total of 12 marks!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>There were a total of twelve of them. Each of them was extremely precious and could decide the outcome of the battle.</p><p>“Now, you can set off, no matter what method you use!”</p><p>The old man ordered again.</p><p>the strongest is only in the absolute Saint realm. Let’s kill our way in. Let’s go!</p><p>A ferocious look flashed in Ouyang wudao’s eyes. He flew into the blood soul sect’s Gate first, followed by the elites of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao and the others charged over and were naturally discovered. Someone immediately shouted.</p><p>“The person who killed you, kill!”</p><p>die! Ouyang wudao shouted and punched out. The people in front of him were killed instantly.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and the elites of the Daluo heaven sect rushed into the blood soul sect like a sharp knife.</p><p>“They directly charged in!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang frowned.</p><p>At first, they wanted to sneak in secretly and use the crystal ball to sense the imprints. Then, they would secretly snatch the imprints. However, after Ouyang wudao’s actions, it was no longer possible to sneak in secretly.</p><p>“We’ll charge in from the other side!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, they headed to the right and charged out from the other side of the blood soul sect.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji led his men and charged from the left.</p><p>Now, he had no idea who had the mark on them, so he could only try his luck.</p><p>Mount Xue hun had more than a dozen mountains. It covered a wide area and had tens of thousands of disciples.</p><p>But at this moment, the entire blood soul sect was in an uproar. Someone was attacking the blood soul sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Figures rose into the air from the dozen mountains of the blood soul sect and flew in all directions.</p><p>“There are enemies here!”</p><p>Someone discovered Lu Ming and the others. Instantly, a large number of figures rushed toward them, and all kinds of terrifying attacks flooded toward them.</p><p>However, there were no absolute Saints among them. The most powerful ones were only great saints. How could they be a match for Lu Ming and the others?</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest rushed past and a large number of corpses fell to the ground. In an instant, they had killed more than a hundred people.</p><p>They didn’t stop as they charged into the depths of the blood soul sect. No one could stop them.</p><p>At this moment, everyone noticed that their crystal balls were flashing with light.</p><p>there’s an imprint within 1000 meters!</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>Someone pointed ahead. Not far away, there was a group of people. One of them was a burly man with a faintly discernible mark on his body. This mark would only appear when he sensed the crystal ball. Normally, it couldn’t be seen.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The burly man roared. A group of people charged toward Lu Ming and the others. Many of them were in the great saint realm, and the burly man was in the great saint perfection realm.</p><p>Light spots appeared on Lu Ming’s body. More than 100 holy weapons flew out and turned into a bright light, attacking the other party.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Holy weapon killed the experts of the blood soul sect wherever it passed.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Retreat!”</p><p>The burly man turned pale with fright. He wanted to retreat, but Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared behind him. He swung his absolute Saint weapon, and the burly man spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Ninth Prince, I’ll let you kill this person!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Although it was the same for whoever obtained the imprint, if Ouyang Wushuang obtained it, his weight would undoubtedly be greater. In the eyes of the divine Yuan Empire’s elders, Ouyang Wushuang would have a better impression of him.</p><p>Therefore, he would let Ouyang Wushuang kill those that he could kill.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang took a step forward and threw out a palm. The sky and earth were in chaos. The terrifying Palm Power broke through all the attacks and defenses of his opponent. The burly man’s body was torn into pieces before he could even scream.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s talent and combat strength were absolutely terrifying. Otherwise, he would not have been able to obtain the identity of Hunyuan sect’s Silver inheritor.</p><p>As soon as the burly man died, a mark flew out and into Ouyang Wushuang’s crystal ball.</p><p>The first mark was a good start.</p><p>Then, the group continued to charge toward the depths of the blood soul sect.</p><p>The blood soul sect was in chaos, and the sounds of killing could be heard everywhere.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the group rushed past a mountain peak, the crystal ball reacted again.</p><p>“Another mark has appeared. It’s that old man!”</p><p>Someone shouted. He saw a thin old man with a mark on his body.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically when he saw the group. His body plunged into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>“Not good, he’s trying to escape underground!”</p><p>Someone’s expression changed.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body also rushed to the ground. The law of chaos had transformed into the law of earth. The ground was like water. Lu Ming rushed in and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming rushed out from the ground again. There was an additional mark in the crystal ball in his hand.</p><p>After that, everyone continued on their way.</p><p>They had no idea who had the marks on their bodies. These marks had been planted by a Martial Emperor powerhouse at will. It could be someone with a strong or weak cultivation base. Therefore, they could only find them by constantly searching..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
