She was about to rush out of the valley.</p><p>...</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, a sword light burst forth, and a terrifying sword light tore towards Huang Ling.</p><p>The power of this sword light was extremely terrifying. Huang Ling’s expression changed. At the critical moment, a Sword of Fire appeared in her hand and she blocked in front of her.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A terrifying collision rang out and flames shot out in all directions. Huang Ling’s figure retreated rapidly and she only managed to stabilize herself after retreating more than ten steps.</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, a few figures appeared, their demonic Qi soaring to the sky.</p><p>“Falcon, it’s you!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s heart sank.</p><p>Several figures appeared at the entrance of the valley. They were experts of the celestial Bird Palace, and the leader was the strongest genius of the younger generation of the celestial Bird Palace, Falcon.</p><p>Huang Ling, to be honest, it’s a pity for such a beautiful woman like you to die like this!</p><p>Falcon was the first to step over. His eyes were as sharp as knives as he looked at Huang Ling with a burning gaze. His eyes kept scanning her body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Behind him, the fire cage exploded. Wan Zhengyang rushed out of the fire cage, and his cold killing intent burst out, pressing toward Huang Ling.</p><p>In the sky, a few giant wolves from the Skywolf tower blocked their way.</p><p>Huang Ling was in a desperate situation.</p><p>everyone, it would be a pity to kill this woman directly. Why don’t you cripple her first and let me bring her back to play with her?”</p><p>Falcon licked his lips and kept glancing at Huang Ling’s body. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Falcon, if you want to play, 1 have an idea!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang rolled his eyes as if he was brewing a vicious plan, bring the Phoenix Spirit and play outside the cauldron mountain. Lure Lu Ming out and we’ll set up an ambush to kill him in one fell swoop!</p><p>“As long as we send out the younger generation, the experts from the Dayan elixir Palace will not say anything. Lu Ming’s death will be in vain. Haha!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang then laughed smugly.</p><p>that’s a good idea. However, if the people in Phoenix Palace knew about this, they would probably go crazy!</p><p>Falcon’s eyes turned, as if he was thinking about whether this idea was feasible.</p><p>we’ll just think of a way to hide it from those people in Phoenix Palace. Falcon, are you so timid that you don’t even dare to do this? ”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang sneered.</p><p>“Who says I don’t dare?”</p><p>The flames in Falcon’s eyes grew even more intense.</p><p>“Despicable! Don’t even think about getting your way!”</p><p>Huang Ling let out a long cry, and her entire body was about to turn into flames. Endless flames gathered towards her, and she turned into a flaming phoenix, charging up into the sky.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Above her, a few giant wolves attacked at the same time, charging towards Feng Ling.</p><p>A series of collisions rang out. Huang Ling was alone and her cultivation was at a disadvantage. In the end, she did not manage to rush out and was blasted down.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Saint weapons flew out from Wan Zhengyang’s body, and their battle weapon Qi soared to the sky as they charged toward Huang Ling. At the same time, Falcon and the others also charged toward her.</p><p>Huang Ling tried her best to fight against the crowd, but after a few moves, her body flew far away. She spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and her face was pale.</p><p>However, her body was still covered in flames. She rushed to the side, trying to get out.</p><p>the undying celestial phoenix body, the law of undying fire, and your vitality is indeed amazing. But today, your fate is already decided. Accept your fate!</p><p>Wan Zhengyang said coldly. He took a step forward, and more than two hundred Saint weapons tore through the void, making a terrible whistling sound, and charged toward Huang Ling.</p><p>Falcon and the others also took action at the same time.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang or Falcon alone were more powerful than Huang Ling, not to mention so many experts attacking at the same time. Huang Ling was no match for them at all. After a few moves, she was sent flying again and spat out blood.</p><p>If it were not for her physique, the extremely mysterious law of the imperishable flame, and her astonishing vitality, she would have been killed by now.</p><p>But even so, Huang Ling was still severely injured.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Wan Zhengyang, Falcon, and experts from the Sirius tower, a total of more than ten people, surrounded Feng Ling.</p><p>Huang Ling had no way to retreat.</p><p>everyone, let’s cripple her. Such a beautiful woman must taste good!</p><p>The evil in Falcon’s eyes became even more intense.</p><p>Huang Ling’s heart sank. Then, a hint of ruthlessness flashed in her eyes.</p><p>She would rather die than fall into Falcon’s hands and be used by the other party to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flames on her body went berserk and were extremely violent.</p><p>“She wants to self-destruct, stop her!”</p><p>die! Wan Zhengyang shouted. More than 200 Saint weapons gathered and formed a terrifying suppressive force. It pressed down on Huang Ling, trying to stop her from self-destructing.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The Eagle roared and turned into a huge black Eagle. With a flap of its wings, it was as big as a mountain and it charged towards Huang Ling.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying power shook, and the flames that Huang Ling had burst out were extinguished. Her body was sent flying, and she spat out another mouthful of blood. Her face was extremely pale.</p><p>Her face was filled with despair. There were too many of them, and she couldn’t even self-destruct.</p><p>“You want to self-destruct? dream on.”</p><p>Falcon shouted coldly as he pounced towards Huang Ling, wanting to cripple her cultivation.</p><p>Huang Ling’s injuries worsened and it was difficult for her to Dodge.</p><p>Just as the Falcon’s attack was about to hit Huang Ling’s body, the air around her started to ripple like water. Then, Huang Ling’s body disappeared like an illusion.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Falcon’s attack landed on the ground, causing a huge boom and a huge pit to appear.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Eagle’s eyes were as sharp as blades. He shouted and scanned the surroundings. Finally, he stopped in the sky above the valley.</p><p>There, a black-robed young man stood in the air, exuding a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>A two or three-year-old girl sat on his back, also staring at Wan Zhengyang and the others with an unfriendly expression.</p><p>Of course, the two people were Lu Ming and bubbles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing here?”</p><p>Huang Ling stood beside Lu Ming, looking surprised.</p><p>Earlier on, it was bubbles who had saved Feng Ling at the critical moment.</p><p>I only rushed here because I accidentally heard that Wan Zhengyang and the others were going to attack you. It seems like I’m still a little late!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Why is he here?”</p><p>When Wan Zhengyang and the rest saw Lu Ming, their expressions changed drastically and they even took a step back.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fearsome reputation was too great. A month ago, when all living beings refined a demon Thearch, it was truly terrifying.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? This isn’t the great Yan elixir Palace, so he can’t control the great Yan elixir formation. He’s just an ordinary Saint realm expert!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang shouted, stabilizing the morale of the Army.</p><p>that’s right. He’s here just in time. We can kill him here and save ourselves some effort!</p><p>Falcon also said.</p><p>“That’s right, we can kill him and avenge the demon God!”</p><p>The killing intent of the giant wolves from the Skywolf tower grew stronger.</p><p>That was right. This was not the great Yan elixir Palace. Lu Ming could not control the great Yan elixir formation. What did they have to fear? It was a good time to kill Lu Ming and get rid of future trouble..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
