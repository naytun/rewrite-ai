There were several generations of Hall Masters who were extremely powerful. Unfortunately, there were several generations of Old Hall Masters who failed to pass the Tribulation and died under it! the old man said as if he was reminiscing.</p><p>the great Yan elixir Scripture and the great Yan elixir furnace of the great Yan elixir Palace were coveted by others. In the past, there were several generations of Old Hall Masters guarding it, and no one dared to touch it. However, after the fall of the Old Hall Masters, other forces began to stir. After that, the previous Hall Master had no choice but to seal the great Yan elixir Palace and hide it in the endless void!</p><p>in the endless years that followed, the others died of old age, and the previous Palace Master also fell under the Great Tribulation. Only my branch was left to guard the great Yan elixir Palace for generations…</p><p>The old man continued to explain and Lu Ming roughly understood.</p><p>The old man’s lineage was the servants of the great Yan elixir Hall and the Guardians of the great Yan elixir Hall. They had guarded the great Yan elixir Hall for generations.</p><p>In the countless years that the great Yan elixir Hall had been in seclusion, everyone else had died of old age. The previous Hall Master of the great Yan elixir Hall had also fallen under a Great Tribulation. The inheritance of the great Yan elixir Hall had been severed, and only the old man’s lineage had continued.</p><p>However, he was the only one left from the elder’s lineage. If Lu Ming did not come, the entire Dayan elixir Hall would probably disappear in the long river of history.</p><p>“Hall Master, you can cultivate here in the future. If there is anything you don’t understand, you can ask this old servant!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Senior, you don’t have to be so polite. You can just call me Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming was not used to the old man calling him an old servant.</p><p>no, you’re the palace Master of the great Yan elixir Palace and I’m a servant of the great Yan elixir Palace, so I should address you as Palace Master with respect. Also, Palace Master, don’t call me senior in the future. This old servant can’t bear the responsibility. Palace Master, you can just call me by my name in the future. My name is dan Kong!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Then 1’11 call you uncle Kong. This matter is settled!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The old man muttered to himself for a moment, then nodded, Hall Master, you should first familiarize yourself with the great Yan elixir formation and the great Yan elixir Scripture. Later on, this old servant will explain some of the wonderful uses of the great Yan elixir furnace to Hall Master. It will be of great help to Hall Master!</p><p>“Many thanks, uncle Kong!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Dan Kong revealed a smile on his face. Then, he walked toward the stone room with his walking stick and disappeared.</p><p>Obviously, there was another space in front of the stone room.</p><p>After the elder left, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and familiarized himself with the control of the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed. Lu Ming felt that he had almost mastered the control of the great evolution elixir formation.</p><p>let’s go out for a while. I came in alone. 1 wonder how Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others are doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, feeling a little uneasy.</p><p>Previously, he had killed many heaven’s favorites from the four forces and the Golden Crow clan, but the fourth Crown Prince of the Golden Crow clan had escaped. This matter would probably cause a commotion among the four forces and the Golden Crow clan. He didn’t know if Huang Ling and Long Chen would be implicated. If he didn’t get to the bottom of this, he wouldn’t be at ease.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked towards the stone door of the stone room. Miraculously, when he reached the stone door, a door of light automatically appeared and Lu Ming passed through it.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was in control of the entire Grand Yan formation. He could enter and exit any place in the Grand Yan elixir Hall freely.</p><p>There were still countless people waiting outside the mountain of pill furnaces.</p><p>A few days ‘time was just a blink of an eye to a martial arts powerhouse. It was nothing.</p><p>“Someone’s coming out of the pill Furnace Mountain!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Then, everyone’s eyes turned to the mountain of pill furnaces.</p><p>A black-robed young man flew through the air in the mountain of alchemy furnaces. Who else could it be but Lu Ming?</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, and the Skywolf tower all glared at Lu Ming with eyes as sharp as divine swords. They did not even bother to hide their killing intent.</p><p>However, the expressions of Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t come out! Hurry back to the mountain of the pill furnace!”</p><p>Huang Ling shouted anxiously.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>die! the WAN family Martial Emperor shouted coldly as he looked at Huang Ling with his sharp eyes, causing her to turn pale.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming saw the people outside and heard Huang Ling’s voice. However, he did not stop and continued to step on the air. He only stopped when he reached the edge of the alchemy Furnace Mountain.</p><p>He looked around and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that both Feng Ling and Long Chen were safe and sound.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you get the great evolution elixir Scripture and the great evolution elixir furnace?”</p><p>The WAN family Martial Emperor’s eyes were as sharp as a sword as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“So what if I am? So what if I’m not?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his head and looked at the WAN family’s Martial Emperor. He was not afraid of a Martial Emperor at all.</p><p>“No matter what, come with me to the WAN family!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign spoke in a cold voice. His tone was completely commanding, but it did not allow any room for doubt.</p><p>An Emperor’s words carried enormous weight and were unquestionable.</p><p>“Hehe, how shameless. Since ancient times, treasures belong to those who are fated to obtain them. Even if Lu Ming obtained the Dayan elixir Scripture and the Dayan elixir furnace, it was his good fortune and opportunity. You, a Martial Emperor, actually want to snatch the opportunity of a junior. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by the world?”</p><p>The martial sovereign of Phoenix Palace spoke with disdain.</p><p>who said 1 wanted to take his fortune? he killed many of our clan’s geniuses, so he has to pay the price. Furthermore, the appearance of evil Spirit’s vice sect leader means that evil spirit is about to rise again. 1 suspect that he’s from evil spirit, and he specializes in lulling geniuses with the potential to become monarchs. 1 want to bring him back to the WAN clan for interrogation, so why not?”</p><p>The WAN family’s Martial Emperor quibbled and directly accused Lu Ming of being from evil spirit.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming specializes in killing prodigies. We must bring him for interrogation!</p><p>The martial sovereign of the Skywolf tower also said with greed in his eyes.</p><p>In their opinion, not only did Lu Ming have the Dayan elixir Scripture and the Dayan elixir furnace, but he also had other secrets. If they could get their hands on Lu Ming’s secrets, it would definitely be of great use to the major forces.</p><p>“Hehe, what a joke. This is a martial sovereign? You’re actually so despicable!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His words were filled with mockery and disdain.</p><p>&Nbsp;” how dare you, a junior, not kneel when you see an Emperor and even mock me? I will cripple you now!</p><p>The WAN family Martial Emperor bellowed, and a violent aura burst out from his body, pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he retreated like lightning.</p><p>you want to leave? in front of me, you’re delusional!</p><p>die! the WAN clan martial sovereign shouted coldly. He took a step forward and the world rumbled. Then, he waved his hand and a huge hand that covered the sky and the sun grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The faces of Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others changed drastically.</p><p>The WAN family’s martial sovereign was too shameless. He actually attacked a junior.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. He retreated quickly and waved his hand at the same time. The entire area around the mountain of alchemy furnaces glowed. A ray of light spread out and rushed toward the big hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent explosion, the huge hand exploded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
