At this moment, the cold Qi in her body suddenly converged on one side of her body, while the other side of her body emitted a hot Qi.</p><p>At the same time, a fiery red scimitar flew out, and the terrifying heat wave burned and distorted the space.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the two scimitars was emitting a cold air while the other was emitting a hot air. They slashed toward Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>The cold and the hot collided with each other, producing a terrifying energy that blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This energy was very terrifying. It had the power to destroy and even Lu Ming felt a sense of danger.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and struck the energy. A crackling sound was heard and the two scimitars were knocked back by Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming felt his fingers go numb. Waves of destructive energy were about to annihilate him.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the great sage mastery, he might not have been a match for them.</p><p>“A superior-grade heavenly spiritual body, and … One of the king path laws, the law of yin and yang!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Qiu Yue was worthy of being chosen by the only divine temple. She had brought the only divine temple from the divine wilderness. Her talent and potential were shocking. Not only did she control the laws of the king path, her spiritual body was also a high-tier heaven spiritual body. Her cultivation had already reached the Great Perfection of the great saint realm.</p><p>This level of combat strength was even stronger than Ouyang Wushuang, Ouyang wudao, and the others.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang, Long Chen, and Huang Ling also had such talent, but their cultivation was not at the great saint perfection.</p><p>“Yin Yang convergence!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted. Two streams of air burst out from her body. One was hot and one was cold, one was Yin and one was yang. They collided with each other and formed a terrifying destructive force.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I’m lu Ming. I’m your young master. You said that you’ll serve me for the rest of my life. Have you forgotten?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s shout was like thunder in spring, ringing in Qiu Yue’s ears.</p><p>Qiu Yue frowned and shouted,”shameless brat, are you trying to lie to me again?” Can’t you change to something new? Kill!”</p><p>The two scimitars spun rapidly like a storm and came for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Tai Chi formation disk appeared. A Tai Chi yin-yang fish pattern was formed and it suppressed Qiu Yue.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Tai Chi pattern collided with the two scimitars, producing a dull boom.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s punches were like the wind, dispersing the terrifying destructive airflow.</p><p>While Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were clashing, Ouyang Wushuang had also encountered a strong enemy.</p><p>Ouyang wudao charged toward Ouyang Wushuang, and the two of them were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang had mastered the king path law and was more talented. However, Ouyang wudao’s cultivation was stronger. It was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>However, the talents of the Daluo heaven sect rushed toward the mountain, bubble, go and snatch that flag!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Leave it to me, chirp chirp!”</p><p>The bubble flew off from Lu Ming’s shoulder. Its petite figure flickered and it flew towards the mountain at top speed. The array was almost useless against the bubble.</p><p>After a while, bubbles had almost caught up with the talents of the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>“How is that possible? Is that the Law of Time and space?”</p><p>“Go stop her!”</p><p>The elites of the Daluo heaven sect exclaimed. Then, two or three of them rushed toward the bubble and attacked it with all kinds of attacks.</p><p>Chirping…</p><p>In a flash, Pao Pao’s figure rippled through the air. By the time the attacks landed, she had already disappeared. In the next moment, she had passed by the few of them and was charging towards the mountain.</p><p>not good! The spacetime laws are too strange. I can’t attack her at all!</p><p>Someone shouted anxiously.</p><p>“All of you, attack! Use the laws to block the void and stop her!”</p><p>Bai mu shouted and suddenly changed his direction. A terrifying power of law bloomed and covered the sky, locking the void with the power of law.</p><p>The other paragons attacked at the same time. All sorts of nomological laws were like chains that locked down the void.</p><p>Paopao’s figure flickered continuously. However, with the void being sealed, she was unable to rush over.</p><p>“Hmph, I’m switching sides …”</p><p>Bubbles’s tender voice was heard. She moved her body and wanted to charge in another direction.</p><p>However, there were too many of them. There were more than a dozen heaven’s favorites and most of them were great saints in the Great Perfection realm. With more than a dozen of them joining forces, the laws were confined in all directions and they completely blocked bubble’s escape route.</p><p>“Let’s join hands and take her down!”</p><p>Bai mu gave the order, and the power of law burst forth. More than a dozen people joined forces in an attempt to take down bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles ‘figure flickered unsteadily, and the space around her flickered. It would not be easy for the other party to take her down.</p><p>For a time, the two sides were in a stalemate.</p><p>The battle between Lu Ming and Qiu Yue was getting more and more intense.</p><p>“Qiuyue, have you forgotten about Li Ping and Lu Yuntian? Have you forgotten about the Lu family?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he attacked, hoping to awaken Qiu Yue’s memory.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted as her brows furrowed. The laws of yin and yang represented the foundation of the world. Even among the laws of King Dao, it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The cold current collided with the scorching heat, producing a terrifying energy that surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw three consecutive punches and blocked Qiu Yue’s attack.</p><p>“Qiuyue, have you forgotten about the mystical sword sect? Have you forgotten about the burning sun Empire?”</p><p>“Qiuyue, have you forgotten about yuehuan mountain and Emerald Lake?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept shouting, telling Qiu Yue some of the things that she was most familiar with and experienced the most.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes kept changing, as if she was trying to grasp something. But he couldn’t catch it.</p><p>“Nonsense! I’ll kill you!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted and two curved daggers slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then I’ll let you kill me!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming put away the Tai Chi formation disk and the chaos laws. He let the two curved daggers slash at him.</p><p>The two scimitars were about to hit Lu Ming, but he did not move. He looked at Qiu Yue with a gentle gaze, just like how he did in the past.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue’s heart trembled.</p><p>She subconsciously retracted her force. However, the speed of the two curved daggers was too fast. Although she had retracted most of her force, they did not stop and slashed Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood gushed out. The two scimitars sank deep into Lu Ming’s shoulders and went straight through his bones. Blood stained Lu Ming’s long robe.</p><p>Qiu Yue was stunned. She looked at Lu Ming in a daze and said,”You … Why didn’t you Dodge?”</p><p>“Why should 1 hide? You and I have been together for more than ten years. If you want to kill me, then 1 will let you kill me. 1 only hope that you can remember!”</p><p>Lu Ming said gently.</p><p>“You … Is everything you’ve said true?”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>of course it’s true. I’m lu Ming, your young master. We’ve been together for more than ten years. The jade pendant you’re wearing was a gift from my mother. Do you still remember? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said gently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two scimitars flew from Lu Ming’s shoulders and disappeared into Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s gaze fell on the jade pendant around her neck. This was the jade pendant that she had always worn on her body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
