Young lady, have you heard of the desolate race?”</p><p>...</p><p>The burly man looked at Qiu Yue in surprise.</p><p>I once read about it in an ancient book that master left behind. It is said that the desolate race is an extremely ancient race, but in rhe distant past, they had disappeared from the world. I never expected that they would be in the legendary Savage barren ancient region!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>haha, the young lady is right. The desolate race has been in seclusion for a very long time. They have been living in seclusion in the ancient Savage barren realm. 1 never expected that you would be able to find your way in. From what 1 know, it has been a very long time since any outsiders have entered!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>The bodies of the desolate race were all extremely burly, and they were very different from ordinary people. Hence, it was needless to say that the burly man knew that Lu Ming and company had entered from the outside.</p><p>“Senior, where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“The cage battle arena!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“What’s a cage battle arena?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The burly man explained patiently.</p><p>The desolate race was hidden in the ancient wilderness realm and outsiders did not know about it. Lu Ming and company had barged in rashly, so they would naturally be captured.</p><p>And this place was a huge cage battle arena of the desolate race. The people locked up here had committed grave crimes or were slaves. They had to participate in a Deathmatch, fight with other slaves, fight with ferocious beasts, and fight with the desolate race experts who came here to train.</p><p>The desolate race loved to battle, so a Deathmatch would attract countless members of rhe desolate race to watch.</p><p>Lu Ming understood. They were captured and directly treated as slaves to participate in the Deathmatch for the desolate race to watch.</p><p>As for the burly man, because of Fan Guo’s great crime, he had also become a slave and had to participate in a life-and-death battle.</p><p>“The Deathmatch in the cage battle arena is usually a battle between those of the same level. As long as you win a hundred battles in a row, you’ll be able to obtain freedom and leave this place. You and that little doll control the Laws of Chaos and the laws of time and space, so you definitely have a chance of winning a hundred battles!”</p><p>The burly man explained.</p><p>win too matches in a row and you’ll be free!</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes lit up.</p><p>As long as they could regain their freedom, they would have a chance.</p><p>of course, the desolate race loves to fight, and they respect people with strong combat strength the most!</p><p>The burly man said. He then looked at the innermost wall and said, when the Deathmatch begins, that wall will appear. This is also a chance for us Deathmatch fighters to observe other people’s combat strength!</p><p>Next, Lu Ming and the rest chatted with the burly man for a while. It was the first time the burly man had met an outsider and he was rather enthusiastic. He told them everything he knew, allowing Lu Ming and the rest to have a better understanding of the place.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the inner wall of the secret room suddenly glowed, and then a massive image appeared.</p><p>It was an enormous cage battle arena that was extremely wide. Surrounding the cage battle arena were rows of spectator stands that were filled with people.</p><p>All of them were burly desolate race members. Even the women were more than two meters tall. They were burly, with the backs of Tigers and waists of bears. They were filled with strength.</p><p>A deafening howl could be heard through the screen.</p><p>Even sound could be heard from this scene. It was truly amazing.</p><p>However, the experts in the world of martial Dao controlled the laws of heaven and earth. Laws were the foundation of the world, so no matter how wondrous things were, they could create them. It was not surprising.</p><p>The cage battle had begun!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>roar! a roar sounded out, and an enormous fierce beast walked out of a large door on the side of the cage battle arena.</p><p>This was a Tiger-shaped ferocious beast, but its entire body was covered in pitch-black scales. Its fangs were like swords, and it looked extremely ferocious.</p><p>“This is a wild mutant!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>These beasts looked very ancient and were rarely seen in the outside world. They could only be found in the ancient Wildlands.</p><p>Meanwhile, a figure walked out of a large door on the other side of the cage battle arena.</p><p>“Mo Qingshan!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and bubbles hearts were moved.</p><p>The person who walked our was actually mo Qingshan.</p><p>“This person came in from the outside with you, right?”</p><p>The burly man asked.</p><p>that’s right. This person is very strong. He’s in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. Aren’t you afraid that he ll take the opportunity to escape if you let him out like this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Escape? There are no less than five martial sovereigns guarding this cage battle arena, and if he were to escape, only death would await him as he would be instantly killed!”</p><p>The burly man said in disdain.</p><p>“Five martial sovereigns?”</p><p>Lu Ming drew in a breath of cold air. The strength of the desolate race was truly extraordinary.</p><p>It was only a cage battle arena, yet it was actually not inferior to five martial emperors overseeing it. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Initially, he had brought the experts of the mo clan into the savage barren ancient realm in search of treasures. However, he did not expect to be ambushed the moment he entered and be captured to this place.</p><p>He was also told that he would only be free if he won 100 battles in a row.</p><p>At this moment, mo Qingshan’s heart sank.</p><p>This was because the beast he was facing had an extremely terrifying aura. Without a doubt, it was also in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm, and it was a wild mutant. Its battle-power was hard to predict.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ferocious beast roared and pounced towards mo Qingshan. Its four limbs stomped on the ground, causing the earth to rumble.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan also let out a roar as he unsheathed his sword. A terrifying sword light cut through the void and slashed towards the ferocious beast.</p><p>The ferocious beast’s roar was like thunder. That roar actually formed a terrifying sound wave that destroyed the sword light. At the same time, it extended its huge claw and shattered the sword light.</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s expression was grave as he soared into the sky. Endless sword light poured down from the sky and slashed at the ferocious beast. However, most of the sword light was destroyed by the ferocious beast. A few sword lights slashed at the body of the ferocious beast and actually produced the sound of metal clashing and sparks flying in all directions.</p><p>Mo Qingshan’s sword light was actually unable to break through the defense of the ferocious beast. It only left a few sword marks on its scales.</p><p>The ferocious beast broke through the sword light and pounced towards mo Qingshan. With a swipe of its claw, it sent mo Qingshan flying.</p><p>Mo Qingshan continued to retreat, his face a little pale.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ferocious beast revealed a malevolent expression and continued to pounce towards mo Qingshan.</p><p>Mo Qingshan was no match for the ferocious beast. The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in a row. Mo Qingshan was completely at a disadvantage. There was one time when his body was almost torn apart. He managed to Dodge the attack by a hair’s breadth, but he was also seriously injured.</p><p>“This old master won’t play with you anymore!”</p><p>Mo Qingshan let out a loud roar as his figure soared into the sky. He actually wanted to break through the sky above the cage battle arena and escape.</p><p>However, at this moment, a huge palm formed in the sky above the cage battle arena and pressed down on mo Qingshan.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Mo Qingshan roared. However, under the giant palm, it was difficult for him to escape and he was sent flying out of the arena.</p><p>The ferocious beast roared and seized the opportunity to grab mo Qingshan. It tore mo Qingshan into pieces with all its might and swallowed him in one gulp, you’ve fled the cage battle arena without thinking. Kill without mercy!</p><p>kill! an imposing voice sounded out in the sky above rhe cage battle arena.</p><p>At this moment, in the other secret rooms, the people from the Imperial City who had entered with Lu Ming and the others naturally saw everything that had happened in the cage battle arena. Their faces were extremely pale.</p><p>Next, they would have to face the same scene. How was it possible to win loo battles in a row?</p><p>He didn’t expect that the ancient Savage barren realm wasn’t a land of treasure, but hell.</p><p>“It’s ail because of that ha Zheng!”</p><p>Many people were secretly resentful. They finally understood why ha Zheng had come in alone without bringing anyone from the HA clan..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
