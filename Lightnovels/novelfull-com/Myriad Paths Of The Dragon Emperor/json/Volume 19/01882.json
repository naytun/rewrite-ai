Or, help me keep an eye out for news in this area!”</p><p>...</p><p>After chatting for a while, Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Right now, he was lacking the materials to make the soul recovery pill. However, this kind of spiritual item was extremely rare. It would be difficult for him to find it by himself. If he asked everyone for help, he would have a better chance.</p><p>“The taisui treasure Lotus?”</p><p>Some of them were at a loss. It was obvious that they had never even heard of it.</p><p>The rest of the people who had heard of it also had a thoughtful expression.</p><p>the astral treasure Lotus is extremely rare. It’s said to be extremely spiritual. It’ll be difficult to find it in a short time, but 1 know a place that might have news of the astral treasure Lotus!</p><p>Luo Tianyi thought for a moment and said.</p><p>“What place?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>For generations, many geniuses had joined the Jade Lake divine Palace, so it was normal for Luo Tianyi to know a lot of information that ordinary people didn’t.</p><p>“Vientiane tower!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi explained,” Vientiane tower is specialized in collecting all kinds of information. Whether it’s from the North or the South, big or small, they will collect information from all over the yuan continent. They have people all over the world. As long as you spend money, you can buy any information!</p><p>“There’s such a place? Where can I find the Vientiane tower?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. If that was the case, he could go to Vientiane tower and ask around. He might be able to gain something.</p><p>there’s a branch of Vientiane tower in heavenly Emperor City. 1’11 give you the specific address!</p><p>Luo Tianyi took out a Jade card and carved the map on it with her spiritual sense. She handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone chatted for a while more before leaving.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue left the yuan mountain sacred Academy together and headed towards Vientiane tower.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor City was extremely vast and boundless. The Vientiane tower was located to the North of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two of them continued to fly, and not long after, they discovered a place that was extremely lively. Many people had gathered around, as if they were watching a good show.</p><p>“Shall we go down and take a look?”</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her eyes and revealed a curious expression.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The two of them landed and discovered an ancient platform. The platform was surrounded by people of all ages.</p><p>On the ancient platform, there was a sword stuck in the ground all the way to the hilt. A middle-aged man grabbed the hilt and used all his strength to push it out, but the sword didn’t move at all.</p><p>“This old man, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted an elder and inquired about the situation.</p><p>Little brother, this must be your first time in heavenly Emperor City. Let me tell you, this sword is the sword of the heavenly Emperor!</p><p>The old man said proudly.</p><p>“What? The celestial Emperor’s sword! Is that true?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>The sword on the platform was actually the celestial Emperor’s sword. How could it have been left behind until now?</p><p>I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s just a legend. It’s said that this platform was built by the celestial Emperor, and this sword was also inserted here by the celestial Emperor. It’s nine feet long, but no one has been able to pull it out for countless years!</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>“No one can pull it out, not even martial sovereigns?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious. Qiu Yue also looked at the old man with a curious expression.</p><p>no, it has nothing to do with one’s cultivation. Many martial sovereigns can’t even pull it out by a foot, but those with low cultivation might be able to pull it out a little. There was once a young man who had just started cultivating who could pull it out by five feet!</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>throughout the ages, the record for the most uprooting was eight feet. Among this generation of young people, there was one who managed to uproot eight feet. He was the descendant of the heavenly Emperor, the peerless genius, Heng Xinghe, who had the bloodline of the heavenly Emperor!</p><p>and I heard that the star River has spread the word that he will pull out this Celestial Emperor’s sword sooner or later and make it his personal sword!</p><p>A middle-aged man interjected.</p><p>Lu Ming roughly understood what was going on.</p><p>At this moment, the burly man on the platform was almost exhausted. In the end, he couldn’t even pull it out by a foot. He retreated from the platform with a red face.</p><p>there are people who come here every day to try. Many of them were very confident in the beginning and thought that they could pull out the celestial Emperor’s sword. But in the end, they were all disappointed!</p><p>The old man shook his head.</p><p>“That’s just wishful thinking. How can the celestial Emperor’s sword be pulled out so easily? For countless years, no matter how many heaven’s favorites have been born, no one has been able to pull it out. It is said that once you pull it out, you may obtain the inheritance of the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>The middle-aged man sneered.</p><p>“That’s just a legend, it can’t be taken for real!”</p><p>The old man shook his head.</p><p>At this moment, another person stepped onto the platform and began to draw his sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a sword rang out, shaking the sky. The hilt of the sword emitted a bright light.</p><p>The sword was pulled out by a foot.</p><p>However, one foot was the limit. No matter how much strength that person used, he could only pull it out by one foot.</p><p>After a while, the man failed and retreated from the platform. The sword returned to the platform, leaving only the hilt.</p><p>“It’s really amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>Even a Martial Emperor powerhouse could not pull out this sword. It was a miracle.</p><p>Martial Emperor powerhouses were extremely powerful when they were enraged, yet they could not even pull out the sword.</p><p>If one wanted to pull out this sword, it had nothing to do with one’s cultivation level. It depended on the person.</p><p>“This sword is mine!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man stepped onto the platform. This person’s expression was cold and arrogant, and he was filled with great confidence, how presumptuous! This sword can’t even be pulled out of the eternal Star River, and this person is saying that it’s his!</p><p>many people were very confident before they went up, but they failed very quickly. I’ve seen many people like this!</p><p>Some people were discussing with disdain.</p><p>The young man snorted and stepped to the hilt of the sword. He held the sword with both hands, exhaled, and pulled it up with force.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword shook the sky. The celestial Emperor’s sword was pulled out by a foot.</p><p>“Rise again!”</p><p>The young man shouted, and his power exploded. The sound of the sword rang out again, and the sword emitted rays of multicolored light.</p><p>three feet! He actually pulled out three feet!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In that instant, the young man had pulled out another two feet, making it a total of three feet.</p><p>this person’s talent is shocking, but he can only pull it out by three feet. Three feet is his limit!</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>“Rise again!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the young man shouted again, and a terrifying power of laws erupted from his body.</p><p>“That is … The laws of the king path!”</p><p>“This person has a King body!”</p><p>Exclamations of shock rang out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With two sword hums, the sword was pulled out another two feet, reaching five feet.</p><p>initial absolute Saint cultivation. This person should be a top genius of the yuan mountain Saint Academy!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. However, he had not seen this person before.</p><p>The young man pulled the celestial Emperor’s sword five feet out and stopped there as if he had reached his limit.</p><p>The young man’s cultivation was pushed to the extreme, and his body was drowned in endless multicolored light.</p><p>PS: three chapters for today and tomorrow, and 30 chapters for the day after tomorrow..
