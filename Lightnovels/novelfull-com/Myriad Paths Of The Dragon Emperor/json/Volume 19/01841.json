The terrifying power swept through the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming pointed with his finger. He used all his strength in this one finger.</p><p>The middle-aged man was already heavily injured and on the verge of death. Now that he was suddenly attacked by the self-destruction of an absolute Saint weapon and the full-powered attack of the chaotic finger, he was unable to withstand it at all. His body immediately exploded and his soul was scattered.</p><p>After Lu Ming attacked with the chaos finger of calamity, bubbles immediately took action and cast the space-time law. Lu Ming’s figure turned illusory again.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao howled madly. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent as he launched a terrifying attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to snatch his mark. He was courting death.</p><p>However, when the attack landed, Lu Ming’s figure dissipated like a Phantom. In the next moment, his figure had already left the battlefield.</p><p>And in his crystal ball, there was another mark.</p><p>Everything had happened too quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming asked bubbles for help and suddenly appeared on the battlefield. With lightning speed, he self-destructed an absolute Saint weapon and attacked with the chaos finger of calamity. Then, he retreated with bubbles ‘help.</p><p>All of this happened in an instant.</p><p>However, in that instant, Lu Ming had already killed the middle-aged man and seized the mark.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao bellowed in rage. He stepped into the air and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dared to snatch food from the Tiger’s mouth and snatch his mark. He was simply courting death.</p><p>The rest of them followed Ouyang wudao and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. With a spatial fluctuation, Lu Ming’s figure reappeared in the distance, near Ouyang Wushuang and the others.</p><p>“Remember the seal, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Everyone rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Ouyang Wushuang, get back here!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao shouted in a commanding tone.</p><p>It was as if he told Ouyang Wushuang to roll back and he would roll back.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s disdainful voice was heard as he flew forward with all his might.</p><p>all 12 marks have appeared. The test is over. Come out now!</p><p>At that moment, a voice rang in everyone’s ears. It was the voice of the divine origin Empire’s elder.</p><p>“All 12 marks have appeared. Damn it!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao stopped and roared. His eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>He only had four imprints on him, which was a third of the total. This number was still very dangerous.</p><p>If either Ouyang Wushuang or Ouyang Wuji had five marks, he would have lost.</p><p>If each of them had four marks, it would only be a draw.</p><p>He didn’t want a tie, but first.</p><p>This made him hate Lu Ming and Ouyang Wushuang even more. If he had obtained the mark just now, he would have five marks and would have the upper hand. Now, he could only hope that he would have four marks for each of the twelve.</p><p>“It’s over, let’s go out!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and the others flew out.</p><p>haha, we have five marks. We have a high chance of winning!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa laughed.</p><p>The chances of winning with five marks were indeed very high. As long as Ouyang Wuji obtained three marks, Ouyang wudao would only have four marks, and they would win.</p><p>The position of Crown Prince would be Ouyang Wushuang’s.</p><p>They flew out at top speed.</p><p>Ouyang wudao led his men and flew out with a gloomy face.</p><p>However, on the way, he met Ouyang Wuji and the heaven’s favorites from the sole divine temple.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Wuji’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>He knew that he had lost. He had no chance at all. He had no fate with the position of Crown Prince.</p><p>“Ouyang Wuji, how many marks did you get?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao looked at Ouyang Wuji nervously. He hoped that Ouyang Wuji had also obtained four marks. This way, this round would be a draw.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s words caused Ouyang wudao’s face to pale.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji had obtained three. Did that not mean that Ouyang Wushuang had obtained five and won first place?</p><p>In this way, Ouyang Wushuang had won two rounds in a row. There was no need to compete in the last round. The position of Crown Prince would belong to Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The killing intent in Ouyang wudao’s eyes intensified.</p><p>It was all Lu Ming’s fault. If he had not made a move and snatched the last mark, he would have won.</p><p>At that moment, he hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“Ouyang wudao, how about we join forces?”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said, his eyes gleaming with a sharp light.</p><p>How could it be so easy for Ouyang Wushuang to seize the position of Crown Prince?</p><p>“Join forces? What’s the point of joining forces now? Ouyang Wushuang has won two rounds in a row. The victory is set!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao said unwillingly.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji smiled faintly. With a wave of his hand, an old man appeared.</p><p>“This person has a mark on his body, but 1 kept it and didn’t kill him. I’ll leave it to you now!”</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said.</p><p>Ouyang wudao’s eyes lit up and emitted a bright radiance. He had never expected that Ouyang Wuji would actually leave one person alive.</p><p>“Since you’re helping me like this, what’s the request?”</p><p>Ouyang wudao asked.</p><p>I don’t have any requests. 1 just don’t want Ouyang Wushuang to become the Crown Prince!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said coldly.</p><p>In any case, he had no hope of getting it, but Ouyang Wushuang could forget about getting it either.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ouyang wudao stepped forward and struck out with his palm, killing the elder. Instantly, the number of imprints on his side increased to five.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>Ouyang wudao was overjoyed.</p><p>In this case, he and Ouyang Wushuang had tied for this round. Then, they would decide the winner in the third round.</p><p>If he were to get first place in the third round and Ouyang Wushuang was last, the Crown Prince position would be his.</p><p>then let’s let Ouyang Wushuang get the last place in the third round!</p><p>Ouyang Wuji said coldly.</p><p>haha! Sixth brother, I won’t forget you if 1 take control of the shenyuan Empire!</p><p>Ouyang wudao laughed. Then, the group flew out.</p><p>When they left the blood soul sect, they discovered that Ouyang Wushuang and the others had already arrived.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji looked at Ouyang Wushuang and Lu Ming with cold killing intent.</p><p>alright, everyone’s here. Take out your crystal balls and let’s see what you’ve got!</p><p>A clan elder said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded and took out their crystal balls.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang had three marks and Lu Ming had two, so there were five marks in total.</p><p>“Five, not bad!”</p><p>The clan elder nodded and looked at Ouyang wudao and the others.</p><p>Ouyang wudao and the others also took out their crystal balls.</p><p>“It’s also five!”</p><p>The faces of Ouyang Wushuang and the others changed.</p><p>He did not expect Ouyang wudao to obtain five of them. In that case, Ouyang Wuji would have obtained two.</p><p>damn it! How could Ouyang Wuji be so useless? he only got two!</p><p>Someone in the purple flame villa muttered.</p><p>If Ouyang Wuji had obtained three, they would have won. However, they did not expect Ouyang Wuji to be so useless as to only obtain two marks..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
