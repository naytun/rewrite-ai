He trained the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation with the thirty thousand troops.</p><p>Half a month passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been cultivating wholeheartedly. His cultivation was approaching the great sage mastery.</p><p>However, after reaching the great saint realm, the progress of cultivation became slower and slower. It became more and more difficult.</p><p>After cultivating for half a month, Lu Ming stopped for a while and walked around. Then, he entered the array to see how Ouyang Wushuang1 s training was going.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>An Army of 30000 galloped across the vast land like a mighty flood. The earth rumbled, and the momentum was shocking.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a black torrent.</p><p>True essence surged, and a Giant Tiger formed in the sky above the 30000 troops.</p><p>This Giant Tiger was tens of thousands of feet tall and was even larger than a mountain. Its aura was shocking.</p><p>This was the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation. 30000 first level martial emperors formed a large formation and formed a heavenly Tiger. Even a half-Saint would be torn apart.</p><p>Furthermore, as the 30000 soldiers trained for a longer period of time, they would become more familiar with the technique and their combat strength would also increase.</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and watched quietly.</p><p>After a few hours of training, the Army finally stopped to rest.</p><p>A figure flew toward Lu Ming. It was Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>‘‘Lu Ming, why are you here today?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said with a smile.</p><p>“I’m here to see how your training is going. How was it? Do you have any confidence in the first test?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’m not confident!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang shook his head and said with a serious face,” “I obtained this heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation by accident. It’s very powerful, but I can’t guarantee that Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji don’t have powerful battle formations!”</p><p>if they have a battle formation that is not weaker than mine, this battle will be very difficult. There are three sides, and they are restraining each other. The situation changes rapidly, and no one is confident of winning!</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The three sides had thirty thousand troops and their abilities were similar. They restrained each other and the situation was constantly changing.</p><p>No one could predict who would win before the results were out.</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his head and pondered for a moment.”! have a battle formation here that is far more powerful than the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation. Perhaps I can give it a try!”</p><p>“its power is far above the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Yes, this formation is called the true dragon battle formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took out a Jade token and passed it to Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>This battle formation had been found in the nine Dragons ‘memories. It was extremely powerful, far above the heavenly Tiger sky roaring formation.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang used his spiritual sense and the joy on his face grew,</p><p>“With this battle formation, I’m even more confident!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang said.</p><p>not necessarily. If he doesn’t use it well, he’ll probably be the first to be eliminated!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was not that optimistic.</p><p>“You’re sayingWould it cause Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji to join forces?”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was also a smart person. He immediately understood what Lu Ming meant.</p><p>If his battle formation was too strong and caused Ouyang wudao and Ouyang Wuji to sense danger, they would join forces to attack him. No matter how strong the true dragon battle formation was, it would still be dangerous.</p><p>therefore, out of the 30000 strong Army, only 5000 can be used to practice the true dragon battle formation. The other 25000 can continue to train the sky Tiger roaring formation. During the battle, it’s best to sacrifice those 25000 people…</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and explained a strategy.</p><p>His plan was simple. When the three sides fought, he would sacrifice 25000 soldiers. This way, there would only be a few thousand people left. To the other two sides, Ouyang Wushuang would not be much of a threat.</p><p>Their attention would only be on each other. This way, Ouyang Wushuang could just sit back and reap the benefits.</p><p>Of course, this plan required the remaining thousands of people to be strong enough and the battle formation they formed to be powerful enough.</p><p>Otherwise, even if they were to sit back and reap the benefits, it would probably be useless.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll follow this plan!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was also a decisive person. He immediately decided to use Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>“Ouyang, I hope that you can win in the first round!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang was a silver inheritor and had to listen to him. Lu Ming also hoped that Ouyang Wushuang could defeat the other two sides and become the Crown Prince, controlling the shenyuan Empire in the future.</p><p>In this way, there were only benefits and no disadvantages to Lu Ming.</p><p>Immediately, Ouyang Wushuang selected five thousand people to train the true dragon battle formation in secret.</p><p>Lu Ming left the array world and strolled around the shenyuan Empire. He bought a few things and headed towards Ouyang Wushuang’s residence.</p><p>you piece of trash, hand over your pill now. Otherwise, I’ll completely cripple you!</p><p>Lu Ming had just turned into a mansion when he heard a voice.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. This is my reward for working hard for a year. Don’t even think about taking it. If you have the ability, kill me!”</p><p>At this time, another voice was heard.</p><p>From their voices, they didn’t seem very old,</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. He moved and appeared on the roof of a Hall. He looked ahead.</p><p>In front of them, there were five to six youths, all around fourteen to fifteen years old. Five of them wore surrounding a black-clothed youth, staring at him with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>The black-clothed youth looked at the others with a stubborn expression.</p><p>Ouyang Moli, since you want to die so badly, we’ll fulfill your wish. Don’t think that wo don’t dare to kill you. A piece of trash like you who can’t even awaken your bloodline, even if we kil 1 you, who would care?”</p><p>A yellow-robed young man sneered.</p><p>that’s right. Hand over the pill. Even if a piece of trash like you gets the stabilizing pill, it’s still a waste of God’s gift. You might as well hand it over to us!</p><p>be filial to us in the future. Only then can trash like you struggle on whilst at death’s door. Otherwise, only death awaits!</p><p>The other youths sneered.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. The stabilizing pill is mine. It’s my last hope. If you want to take the stabilizing pill, you might as well kill me!”</p><p>The black-robed youth, Ouyang Moli, shouted.</p><p>“Hmph, since that’s the case, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man kicked Ouyang Moli in the stomach. Ouyang Moli cried out in pain as his body was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>However, his eyes wore still firm as he stared at the yellow-robed youth and the others.</p><p>“If I don’t die, I’ll definitely return it to you ton times over!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli said. His eyes were cold and filled with killing intent.</p><p>This look made the hearts of the yellow-robed youth and the others turn cold.</p><p>“You won’t have the chance. Today is the day you die!”</p><p>The yellow-robed youth said coldly. His true energy surged and he was about to kill Ouyang Moli.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>His palm glowed, and the reincarnation halberd appeared in his hand.</p><p>But at this moment, the reincarnation halberd shook violently and let out a buzzing sound..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
