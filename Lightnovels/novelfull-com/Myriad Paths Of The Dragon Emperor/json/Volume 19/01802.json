His terrifying aura made the WAN family’s Martial Emperor stop in his tracks.</p><p>...</p><p>“Feng Ling, what’s going on?”</p><p>The martial sovereign of Phoenix Palace asked Feng Ling.</p><p>it’s like this. Long Chen, I, and the others were on our way to the mountain of pill furnaces. On the way, we were surrounded by the WAN family, the Sirius tower, the celestial birds Palace, and the purple pole Palace. Fortunately, Lu Ming arrived and saved us!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>“What? The people of the four forces are trying to kill you. How dare you!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the martial sovereign of Phoenix Palace was furious. He burst into brilliant Phoenix Flames and a huge Phoenix flew forward. The martial sovereign of Wan clan was shocked. He took out his sovereign weapon and blocked the Phoenix.</p><p>the four forces besieged Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others. In the end, they were killed instead. Now, the martial sovereign wants to deal with Feng Ling and the others. This is outrageous. Do you think we, the Phoenix Palace, are easy to bully?”</p><p>The martial sovereign of Phoenix Palace said. A Phoenix circled above his head, and his aura grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the surroundings, the people from the other sects and powers also more or less understood what was going on.</p><p>The four major forces had secretly sent their paragons to kill Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the rest. For some reason, Lu Ming intervened and caused them to be killed. Now, they wanted to blame the people who were surrounded and killed. It was ridiculous.</p><p>They looked at the WAN family, the Sirius tower, and the other major forces with a hint of mockery.</p><p>no matter what, our heaven’s favorite has been killed. The murderer has to pay the price!</p><p>Another figure stepped out with a ferocious aura. This person was the martial sovereign of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>Then, two more figures stepped out. They were the martial sovereigns of the heavenly birds Palace and the ziji sect, who were pressing toward Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>what a joke. Your own people are useless. They couldn’t kill others and were killed instead. If a martial Supreme has to step in, does that mean I can kill any of you?”</p><p>A sneer was heard. A tall and burly figure stepped out beside Long Chen like a giant elephant stepping in the air, and his aura was extremely violent.</p><p>This was a Martial Emperor expert of the divine elephant sect.</p><p>The six Martial Emperor powerhouses exploded with terrifying auras as they faced each other in the sky. The people who were watching in the surroundings kept retreating. Only the Emperor-level powerhouses were able to stand still.</p><p>you four clans have broken the rules like this. From now on, the younger generation can’t go out anymore. Otherwise, every one of you will die!</p><p>A figure covered in the power of Thunder said indifferently, and a terrifying pressure pressed toward the martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the Sirius tower, and the other four major forces.</p><p>This was the martial sovereign of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>The Thunder God sect and the Phoenix Palace had always been on good terms, so they naturally stood on the Phoenix Palace’s side.</p><p>The Thunder God sect’s Martial Emperor’s words made the eyes of all the Martial Emperor powerhouses present light up.</p><p>That’s right. The younger generation wanted to kill someone but was killed in the end. Now that the martial Supreme wanted to take revenge, did this mean that the martial Supremes of the other forces could no longer control them? they could just kill the younger generation of the opposing forces or those below the martial Supreme realm when they saw them?</p><p>In this case, all the major forces would have to die except for the martial sovereign himself. No one would be able to survive.</p><p>What was the point of doing this?</p><p>This was breaking the rules!</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the Skywolf tower, and the other four major forces all looked awful.</p><p>That’s right. If they wanted to attack by force, the martial sovereigns of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect could also attack. They had to be wary of killing people below the rank of martial sovereigns.</p><p>Their expressions were ugly, and they were in a dilemma.</p><p>“Fourth bro, fifth bro, ninth bro, and the others?”</p><p>what’s the matter?” a golden Crow Martial Emperor asked the fourth prince.</p><p>“Dead, they’re all dead. Lu Ming killed them. Patriarch, you must kill Lu Ming and avenge fifth brother!”</p><p>The fourth Crown Prince of the Golden Crow cried.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming again!”</p><p>Around them, the others were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>The few princes of the Golden Crow clan had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>This Lu Ming was truly audacious. First, he had killed the paragons of four major forces, and now, he had even killed the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow clan.</p><p>Audacious and lawless!</p><p>This was the impression that many experts had of Lu Ming.</p><p>damn it! i low dare you kill me, the Golden Crow Crown Prince?!</p><p>The Golden Crow race martial sovereign let out a long and sharp hiss that pierced many people’s eardrums and almost made them vomit blood.</p><p>the WAN family, the Sirius tower, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace were all killed by Lu Ming. This kid suddenly attacked. Despicable!</p><p>The fourth prince of the Golden Crow called out.</p><p>Compared to Huang Ling and Long Chen, he hated Lu Ming more. Now that the situation was at a stalemate, he might as well shift all his hatred onto Lu Ming. He must have Lu Ming killed.</p><p>In fact, that was the case. Before he escaped, he saw that Lu Ming had killed everyone.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the Skywolf tower, and other forces muttered this name softly. Their voices were not heavy, but they contained extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming must die. Now that he has entered the mountain of alchemy furnaces, we’ll wait for him to come out. Once he comes out, we’ll kill him without mercy!”</p><p>The WAN clan martial sovereign said coldly.</p><p>After that, the major forces surrounded the area and waited for Lu Ming to come out.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was unaware of what was happening in the outside world. He entered a huge stone room after he dashed through the door of light.</p><p>The stone chamber was extremely spacious and empty. There was almost nothing else except for a pill furnace.</p><p>In the middle of the stone chamber, there was a huge alchemy furnace, which was at least a hundred meters tall.</p><p>However, this alchemy furnace had been completely corroded. There were spots of rust on it and it had no spirituality at all. It was just like a piece of scrap metal.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings but found nothing.</p><p>“Is this the great Yan elixir Palace? However, there’s nothing here, let alone any inheritance!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in a low voice, feeling a little disappointed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a buzzing sound was heard. Lu Ming was shocked. He retreated and looked around cautiously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another buzzing sound attracted Lu Ming’s attention. He looked at the rusty alchemy furnace. The sound was coming from the alchemy furnace.</p><p>Then, the sound of the furnace shaking became louder and louder.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming saw that the rust on the alchemy furnace had cracked open and was falling off continuously. A Scarlet glow filled the air.</p><p>Furthermore, there were lines of patterns on the pill furnace that were extremely wondrous.</p><p>“It smells so good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could smell a strong medicinal fragrance coming from the alchemy furnace.</p><p>The shaking of the elixir furnace became more and more intense. The rust on the surface of the elixir furnace fell off in large chunks. In the end, a Scarlet elixir furnace appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was glowing with a splendid light, like a divine radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, the pill furnace shook and rose into the air, aiming to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed as he tried to Dodge at top speed. However, a terrifying force erupted from the cauldron. Lu Ming’s surroundings seemed to be confined. He could not move even if he used all his strength.</p><p>nest, I won’t be smashed to death by this alchemy furnace, right? that would be a great injustice!</p><p>This thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind. Then, the huge elixir furnace came crashing down on his head..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
