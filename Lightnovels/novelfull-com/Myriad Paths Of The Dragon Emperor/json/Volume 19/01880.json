How disappointing!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a mocking tone.</p><p>“Die, destructive strike!”</p><p>Luo pokong shouted loudly and burst out with his magical technique, displaying his strongest attack.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and the chaotic finger of tribulation burst forth, clashing with the opponent’s long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook violently as if it was under extreme pressure. Luo pokong’s body shook violently as he retreated continuously.</p><p>Luo pokong’s Divine Art was about 85% mature, and it was a King path law, so its power was already very shocking.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s magical power Technique was at eighty percent maturity, but it was a law of chaos. Its power was equivalent to ninety percent of the law of kings, which was still superior to Luo pokong’s.</p><p>your strongest attack is only so-so, suppress!</p><p>Lu Ming’s finger pointed out continuously. The energy between heaven and earth gathered towards his finger in a frenzy. A few huge fingers formed in succession and pointed at Luo pokong.</p><p>“Extreme penetration!”</p><p>Luo pokong shouted loudly. His body seemed to bow and then shoot out, erupting with astonishing power.</p><p>With the support of the Saint energy of the absolute Saint stage, his long Spear’s penetrative power became even more shocking as he clashed with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few explosions, Luo pokong’s figure retreated again.</p><p>Luo pokong retreated while Lu Ming advanced. The fingers of his right hand were constantly pointing out to cast the chaotic finger of tribulation. On his left hand, the law of formation was operating. Endless runes spread out and formed a sealing force that covered Luo pokong.</p><p>Luo pokong retreated continuously, not daring to let the sealing power Stick to him.</p><p>“Luo pokong is no match, he’s at a disadvantage!”</p><p>“Lu Ming’s abilities are so terrifying!”</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites were all shocked.</p><p>Previously, it was already very shocking that Lu Ming could resist Luo pokong. Now, Lu Ming was actually suppressing Luo pokong.</p><p>“Luo pokong, didn’t you want to trample me under your feet today? Why are you retreating?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke sarcastically, but his attacks did not stop. Instead, they became even more violent.</p><p>&Nbsp; he used the primal Chaos tribulation finger in his right hand to constantly point out the primal Chaos laws.</p><p>The law of the array Dao in his left hand was suffused with endless runes, forming a sealing power that was about to seal Luo pokong.</p><p>Although Luo pokong’s penetrative power was strong, he was suppressed by the finger of tribulation of Primal Chaos. He could only retreat continuously and was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Lu… Ming!”</p><p>Luo pokong hated Lu Ming to the core. Previously, in the only sacred flail in the ancient sun sanctuary, he was no match for Lu Ming’s great sage accomplished cultivation with his great sage perfected cultivation. He was defeated by Lu Ming in public and was humiliated.</p><p>Now that he had entered the yuan mountain sacred Academy and broken through to the absolute Saint realm, he was ambitious and wanted to compete with the heroes of the world. He even wanted to completely trample Lu Ming under his feet. However, after meeting Lu Ming, he was still no match for him and was suppressed.</p><p>He felt a lump in his chest, and it was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s right finger pointed at the void continuously. Then, in the sky, an incomparably huge finger formed, as if a God had come from an eternal unknown place. A finger stretched out and pressed down on Luo pokong. The scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>Luo pokong thrust his spear with all his might. A shocking spear light soared into the sky, trying to pierce through this finger. However, the result was that the spear light exploded and Luo pokong was blasted down from the sky, falling to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo pokong landed on the ground. The ground exploded, and a huge pit was created. Although he managed to stabilize his body, his face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’ve said it before. If I can defeat you once, I can defeat you a second time. You will never be my opponent. When you are defeated by me, you are no longer worthy of being my opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and looked down at Luo pokong from above.</p><p>Luo pokong’s face turned from pale to ashen. His eyes were full of anger and killing intent.</p><p>you only have the upper hand for a moment, yet you dare to say that brother Luo is not worthy of being your opponent. How arrogant. Brother Luo, let me give you a hand!</p><p>Not far away, Kong lang coldly spoke. He then stepped forward, and endless waves appeared around him.</p><p>Kong lang wanted to join forces with Luo pokong to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, let’s join forces and severely injure this brat. After that, we will bring him out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy and cripple him. 1 want him to live like a dog for the rest of his life!</p><p>Luo pokong said. His voice was extremely cold and filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>He had been defeated by Lu Ming time and time again, and there was an inner demon in his heart.</p><p>The air wave treaded on the waves and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“As expected, Kong lang is going to make his move!”</p><p>Many people were moved.</p><p>Kong lang and Luo pokong had come together. As expected, their relationship was not shallow. At this moment, although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was definitely not a match for Luo pokong and Kong Lang’s Joint Forces.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming’s side would eventually lose this battle.</p><p>Many people sighed. Lu Ming’s cultivation was too weak. If one of them had reached the absolute Saint realm, they would not have been in such a passive position.</p><p>two King physiques of the absolute Saint realm joining forces to fight a great saint. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at? ”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and melodious voice was heard. It was very pleasant to the ears and would not be forgotten after hearing it once.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Kong lang shouted as he looked around.</p><p>In the distance, a graceful figure stepped through the air.</p><p>“It’s Luo Tianyi!”</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm as he recognized the person.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. Luo Tianyi was here.</p><p>Luo Tianyi slowly walked over to Kong lang and said,” “If you want to fight, then I’ll fight with you!”</p><p>Hmph, Luo Tianyi, you’re only ranked thirty-sixth on the Saint King ranking. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you. It won’t be too late to fight Lu Ming after I defeat you!</p><p>Kong lang snorted coldly and stepped toward Luo Tianyi. Under his feet, a huge wave rose to the sky, as if it was going to annihilate everything.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Tianyi’s eyes turned dark, as if they had turned into two abysses.</p><p>Kong Lang’s body suddenly stopped.</p><p>The waves under his feet churned and his body started to tremble.</p><p>“Illusion, break!”</p><p>Kong lang roared and waved his hands. In an instant, huge waves surged up and destroyed the world, as if to break Luo Tianyi’s illusion.</p><p>However, when all the waves rushed toward Luo Tianyi, they automatically separated, as if they were deliberately avoiding Luo Tianyi.</p><p>A moment later, Kong Lang’s body trembled, and his face flushed red as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>At this time, Luo Tianyi’s eyes returned to normal and she said indifferently,” “You’re not my match!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Kong lang was shocked. They had only fought for a short while, but he was already injured. He could not break Luo Tianyi’s sky illusion law at all.</p><p>Luo Tianyi gave him an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>Luo Tianyi is so powerful. The current Saint King ranking is not that accurate. It can’t be taken seriously!</p><p>Luo Tianyi is too low-key. Although she’s ranked thirty-sixth on the Saint King List, her strength is probably enough to rank in the top twenty!</p><p>Many people were shocked by Luo Tianyi’s strength.</p><p>In the battle just now, Luo Tianyi had made Kong lang spit blood without even moving his hand. Such strength was simply strange and unpredictable..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
