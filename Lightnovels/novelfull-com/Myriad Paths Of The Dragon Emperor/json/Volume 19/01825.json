He was invincible among his peers. But now, he was defeated by Long Chen in a single move. This shocked everyone.</p><p>...</p><p>Long Chen was being polite when he said three moves, but in fact, he couldn’t even block one.</p><p>the law of extremity. It’s one of the laws of the king path, the law of extremity!</p><p>In the only sacred Hall, someone recognized Long Chen’s law.</p><p>this person has a King physique and can control extreme power. No wonder he’s so terrifying.</p><p>“It’s the same as the ninth Prince, a King body!”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorites from the sacred Hall were discussing.</p><p>“This fellow is also this strong?”</p><p>The paragons of the purple flame villa looked at Long Chen in shock.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had displayed unparalleled combat strength. He did not expect that Long Chen was not weak either. He had defeated the only sanctuary’s genius of the same level with one move.</p><p>Could it be that these few people are all so abnormal?”</p><p>Their gazes then shifted to Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>Mo lang, the Golden Crow second Prince, and the others from the Gu Yue Holy Land all had serious expressions. They already knew Long Chen had a King body and could control the king path laws.</p><p>what’s the point of fighting at the same level? since you’re called a heaven’s favorite, you should fight above your level. Who among you at the peak of the great saint realm wants to fight? ”</p><p>At this moment, Long Chen’s voice rang out, and he looked in the direction of the sole divine temple.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Long Chen was actually going to challenge someone of a higher level.</p><p>Wasn’t he too confident?</p><p>To heaven’s favorites like them, it was not difficult to fight someone above their level.</p><p>However, this was only applicable to ordinary martial artists, such as those who had inferior, medium, or even superior earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>However, who among the top heaven’s favorites could fight above their level?</p><p>This was unless he had a battle prowess that far exceeded those of the same level.</p><p>Hmph, although you have a King body and control the laws of the king path, you might not be able to skip a level and challenge us!</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the sacred temple snorted coldly.</p><p>“Nonsense, do you dare to fight?”</p><p>Long Chen was domineering, and his battle intent was threatening.</p><p>“You asked for it, so I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the sacred Hall stepped out and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>This man was the heaven’s favorite who had defeated the Supreme Saints at the peak of the purple flame villa. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>He was almost invincible in a battle of the same level, not to mention that Long Chen was one level above him.</p><p>I will let you understand that even if you control the laws of the Icing path, you are not invincible!</p><p>die! the only Saint Palace’s heaven’s favorite shouted coldly. A terrifying aura burst out from him, and a dazzling golden light bloomed from his hand, forming a golden sword.</p><p>This person controlled the laws of metal and was extremely sharp.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>An elephant’s cry rang out, and Long Chen’s entire body swelled up. The laws of nature circulated to the extreme, as if it was filled with infinite power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen stepped on the fighting ring, and the ring rumbled as he charged toward his opponent.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The metal sword in his opponent’s hand was extremely sharp. It was ten meters long and slashed at Long Chen. Long Chen punched out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing resounded. The opponent’s gold sword shook violently and then exploded. The man was forced to retreat.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Many people were shocked. Long Chen’s strength was too strong. He was one level higher than his opponent, but he was able to shatter his opponent’s attack with one punch and push him back.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Long Chen took a step forward and threw another punch at his opponent.</p><p>“Ten thousand soldier condensation, slash!”</p><p>die! the only sacred Hall genius shouted. The law of metal circulated, and countless weapons formed in the sky. They attacked Long Chen from all directions.</p><p>However, Long Chen’s attacks were very simple. He just threw out one punch after another, but each punch shook the void and crushed everything in its path. All the weapons in his path were shattered.</p><p>The terrifying fist force continued to surge towards the other party, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“The armored giant!”</p><p>die! the only Saint Palace’s genius shouted. His Saint power surged, and two giant creatures formed in front of him.</p><p>These were two giants. Their entire bodies were golden as if they were completely made of metal. They were ten meters tall and had an oppressive aura.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The two giants stepped forward, and their fists, which were as big as water tanks, smashed toward Long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen fearlessly took the attack head-on with his fist.</p><p>It was a battle between the strong, a contest of strength.</p><p>Long Chen’s fist collided with the armored giant’s fist, creating a terrifying boom.</p><p>“Scrap metal, break!”</p><p>Long Chen let out a long roar, and his fist energy was like a rainbow as he continuously swung it, clashing with the armored giant.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A Vajra realm giant couldn’t withstand Long Chen’s power and was directly crushed.</p><p>Then, Long Chen soared into the sky and stepped on the body of a Vajra giant. This step was like the resurrection of an ancient dragon and elephant, suppressing the heavens.</p><p>The armored giant was also crushed into pieces, turning into energy and disappearing.</p><p>After long Chen crushed the giant, he used the force to pounce on the only genius of the sacred temple. His fist force was like a rainbow, unstoppable.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the sole sacred Hall grunted and flew out of the fighting ring, spitting out blood.</p><p>Long Chen won again.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Previously, it was normal for Long Chen to defeat a heaven’s favorite of the same level with one move. But now, he had crossed a level and defeated the only heaven’s favorite of the sacred temple. This was shocking.</p><p>Furthermore, this heaven’s favorite from the only divine temple was extremely powerful. He had just defeated all the heaven’s favorites of the same level in the purple flame villa.</p><p>The only heaven’s favorite from the temple had a dark expression.</p><p>The paragons of the purple flame villa were dumbfounded.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Huang Ling’s expressions remained unchanged.</p><p>This result was within their expectations.</p><p>Long Chen had mastered the laws of the way of the king, and his spiritual body had evolved into a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body. It was normal for him to defeat an opponent one level higher than him. In fact, Long Chen had not even used his full strength just now.</p><p>“Good, hahaha!”</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang laughed and let out a long breath, releasing all the anger he had suppressed.</p><p>Ouyang Wuji’s face darkened and he did not say anything.</p><p>“Long Chen, it’s my turn to play!”</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling stood up, stepped on the air, and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Long Chen nodded and left the fighting ring.</p><p>guys, I’m also a great saint. I’ll learn from brother Long Chen and challenge someone at the peak of the great saint realm. Who’s going to challenge me?”</p><p>Huang Ling’s voice rang out as she looked towards the one and only divine temple.</p><p>Another great saint in the upper tier challenging a great saint in the peak?</p><p>Could it be that this beautiful woman was also a heaven’s favorite on the same level as Long Chen?</p><p>“How can a heaven’s favorite of that level appear so easily? I don’t believe it. I’ll fight this battle!”</p><p>In the only Sacred Palace, a woman flew up.</p><p>This woman was also quite beautiful, but she paled in comparison to Huang Ling. She was already unhappy when she saw Huang Ling, and now that Huang Ling wanted to challenge a Supreme Saint peak with her cultivation of the great saint realm, she went up directly.</p><p>&Nbsp; without saying anything else, the two of them immediately attacked. The only woman from the sacred Hall controlled the law of water and had countless changes. Her strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, he met Feng Ling and his defeat was set in stone.</p><p>Just like long Chen, after a few moves, Huang Ling knocked her opponent off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Law of unperishable flame, another King body, how is this possible?”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
