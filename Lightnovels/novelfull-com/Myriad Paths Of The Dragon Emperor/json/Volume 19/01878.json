Her life force was extremely strong. She almost turned into the undying fire and rushed toward Feng wuchen. She was not afraid of the wind of destruction and blocked it.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Long Chen, and desolate li seized the opportunity to attack. In an instant, Feng wuchen was forced back a few thousand meters.</p><p>“Don’t think that you’ll be useful just because you have more people!”</p><p>Feng wuchen bellowed as his entire body turned transparent, as if he was about to transform into a gust of wind.</p><p>The wind between heaven and earth was getting stronger and stronger. Tornadoes formed around Feng wuchen, and there were also storm blades.</p><p>The destructive attack swept toward Long Chen and the others.</p><p>“I’ll block it, you guys attack. Undying cage!”</p><p>die! Huang Ling shouted. Endless flames spread out and turned into a huge flame cage, blocking the destructive storm.</p><p>Long Chen and Huang Li stepped forward and appeared beside Feng Ling to protect her. At the same time, they attacked Feng wuchen.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, she stood behind Feng Ling and the others. She did not care about her own defense and attacked with all her might.</p><p>Qiu Yue attacked with all her might. Her attacks were terrifying. With the help of the laws of yin and yang, her two curved blades were extremely destructive. She kept attacking Feng wuchen.</p><p>The heavens and earth seemed to be on the verge of exploding. The others had to stay far away from their battlefield.</p><p>The battle of the five kings!</p><p>Four great saint King physiques were fighting against a King physique of initial absolute Saint.</p><p>This was a rare sight.</p><p>At this moment, more and more people were watching the battle from afar. Even many powerful heaven’s favorites who had been in seclusion appeared.</p><p>Among them, there was a group of people in snow-white robes. They were very eye-catching, especially one of the most beautiful women. She was so beautiful that people kept looking at her.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would be shocked because the woman was Xie nianjun. it’s the ancient Saint clan!</p><p>“Who is that woman? It’s so beautiful!”</p><p>1 heard that he’s a terrifying genius from the ancient Saint clan. He’s extremely powerful!</p><p>Many people looked at Xie nianjun and his group and discussed among themselves.</p><p>But very quickly, everyone’s attention was focused on the battle ahead.</p><p>four great saint King physiques in the great circle are really amazing. If they all break through to the absolute Saint realm, I’m afraid they will stir up a storm in the yuan mountain Saint Academy!</p><p>this is strange. King physique has always been arrogant and solitary. Why are these four King physique gathered together to fight Feng wuchen? ”</p><p>“It seems to be because of a person called Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>you guys have been in seclusion all this time, so you don’t know this. This Lu Ming just joined the yuan mountain sacred Academy not long ago, and he’s a son of chaos!</p><p>“What? The son of chaos!”</p><p>Some people exclaimed in surprise. They didn’t expect that another son of chaos would appear in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>It was no wonder that so many King physiques were gathered together. If it was because of the Son of chaos, then it was not surprising.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>Xie nianjun murmured as a strange light flickered in her eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Long Chen and the other three had teamed up to fight Feng wuchen and finally turned the tables. However, Feng wuchen was an absolute Saint after all. His cultivation was much higher than theirs, so it was almost impossible for them to win.</p><p>However, with the four of them working together, it would be difficult for Feng wuchen to win.</p><p>The battle was very intense, but it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s really intense!”</p><p>At this time, a cold and grave laughter sounded out, and two young men came over together.</p><p>“It’s them, Luo pokong, Kong lang!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically when they saw the two of them.</p><p>“How did these two end up together?”</p><p>Many of them had grave expressions.</p><p>This was because Luo pokong and Kong lang both had King physiques, and it was said that both of them had entered the absolute Saint realm not long ago.</p><p>Two absolute Saint King bodies came together.</p><p>“It’s that b * tch!”</p><p>Luo pokong’s eyes looked directly at Qiu Yue, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Back in the ancient yang sacred land, he was defeated by Lu Ming because of Qiu Yue and lost all his face.</p><p>“Brother Luo, do you know that woman?”</p><p>Kong lang laughed.</p><p>my brother Luo cangqiong has taken a fancy to that woman, but she is against the Daluo heaven sect every day. 1 don’t know where she went a while ago. I didn’t expect to see her here. I’ll take her and send her to my brother!</p><p>Luo pokong took a step forward after he finished speaking.</p><p>There was a penetrating law circulating around his body. His body seemed to be able to penetrate the void. His speed was astonishing, and in an instant, he appeared not far from Qiu Yue.</p><p>He stretched out his hand, and his five fingers were like five long Spears, piercing toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s expression changed. She did not expect that someone would suddenly attack him.</p><p>“Luo pokong!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted and could only use all her strength. She retrieved her two curved blades and attacked Luo pokong.</p><p>But now that Luo pokong had broken through to the absolute Saint realm, his combat strength had soared. He grabbed with his fingers, and Qiu Yue’s two scimitars were sent flying.</p><p>“Qiuyue, leave these people and go to my brother Luo cangqiong!”</p><p>Luo pokong said coldly.</p><p>don’t even think about it. 1 will choose anyone but Luo cangqiong. Let him give up!</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly.</p><p>Her master had also told her that Luo cangqiong had taken away a part of her memory in order to get her. She only felt disgust for Luo cangqiong.</p><p>you don’t know how to appreciate my brother’s kindness. It’s your good fortune that my brother has taken a fancy to you!</p><p>Luo pokong’s face darkened. He kept pointing his finger, and the terrifying spear light pierced through the void and headed toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue quickly retreated and used all her strength to resist, but she was still completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Oh no, lady Qiuyue is in danger. I’ll go help her!”</p><p>Desolate Li’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming was an external elder of the desolate race. He had done the desolate race a great favor and held a high status. As for Qiu Yue and Lu Ming, they had a good relationship and had gone to the desolate race together. Therefore, Huang Li could not let anything happen to Qiu Yue.</p><p>His body flashed and he rushed towards Luo pokong, his fists punching out continuously.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in Luo pokong’s hand. With a shake of the spear, rays of spear radiance shot out, destroying Huang Li’s fist force and forcing him to retreat.</p><p>On the other side, Qiu Yue seized the opportunity to launch an attack on Luo pokong.</p><p>However, Luo pokong’s cultivation base was too strong. With a sweep of his spear, he broke Qiu Yue’s attack.</p><p>Desolate li seized the opportunity and rushed to Qiu Yue’s side. He joined forces with Qiu Yue and fought Luo pokong.</p><p>However, Luo pokong also had a King body, and his cultivation was in the absolute Saint realm. Although he had just broken through to the absolute Saint realm not long ago, and his battle strength was slightly weaker than Feng wuchen’s, the difference was not big.</p><p>Even if desolate li and Qiu Yue joined forces, they were no match for him.</p><p>On the other side, Feng Ling and Long Chen were also at a disadvantage.</p><p>Because of Luo pokong’s interference, the situation in this battle had taken a huge turn.</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others are in trouble this time. They’re no match for two King bodies in the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>that’s right. I’m afraid he’ll be heavily injured and thrown out of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. He’ll lose all his face!</p><p>Some people sighed.</p><p>With Luo pokong’s interference, Huang Ling and the others no longer had a chance.. Moreover, Kong lang, who came with Luo pokong, would he interfere?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
