He smiled and said to Huang Ling and the rest,” I met an old friend. I haven’t seen him for many years. I’ll introduce him to you later!</p><p>...</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped forward and walked toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Lu Ming walked like the wind and arrived beside Qiu Yue in a few steps. He called out, “Qiuyue!”</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was very determined now, he was still a little shaken. He wondered what kind of expression Qiu Yue would have when she suddenly saw him.</p><p>Qiu Yue turned around and looked at Lu Ming when she heard him. However, Lu Ming was stunned by her gaze.</p><p>It was a kind of silence and there was a vague look of disgust in his eyes as if Lu Ming was a stranger.</p><p>“Qiuyue, long time no see!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Qiu Yue’s mouth, and the disgust in her eyes became even stronger.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Qiu Yue would never speak to him like that. Could it be that the person in front of him was not Qiu Yue?</p><p>That was impossible. Lu Ming grew up with Qiu Yue and they had been together for more than ten years. He could not be mistaken. Even if Qiu Yue’s temperament had changed a little, she was definitely Qiu Yue.</p><p>Moreover, no matter how high a person’s cultivation level was, their intrinsic aura would not change. Lu Ming would definitely remember Qiu Yue’s aura correctly!</p><p>The beauty in front of him was Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I’m young master. I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and reached out to pull Qiu Yue’s small hand.</p><p>“Lecher, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted as a blade of light burst out from her hand. It was extremely terrifying and bone-chilling. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he retreated, avoiding the blade of light.</p><p>fanatic, how dare you flirt with my Junior Sister Qiuyue in broad daylight? I’ll kill you!</p><p>A fiery-red figure rushed toward Lu Ming. It was a young man with cold eyes. He threw a palm at Lu Ming. The fiery palm print made the void tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was in a state of shock and he did not Dodge. The palm landed heavily on his body. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he drifted backward.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The young man’s eyes turned cold. He felt that when his palm landed on Lu Ming’s body, it was as if he had landed on an Immortal Diamond. He could not move it at all.</p><p>How was it possible with his great sage mastery cultivation?</p><p>“It must be an illusion, kill!”</p><p>The young man took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming, intending to kill him.</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p>Long Chen stepped forward and threw a punch. The young man’s expression changed as he felt that he couldn’t fight against this punch. At the critical moment, he stopped himself and backed off to avoid long Chen’s punch.</p><p>“You’re lucky today!”</p><p>The young man snorted coldly and swept his cold gaze at Lu Ming. Then, he turned around and left.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue had already floated away and disappeared into the crowd. From the beginning to the end, she did not even look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on? Qiuyue doesn’t seem to recognize me at all!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly and could not understand.</p><p>Although his temperament had changed a lot over the years, he had been with Qiu Yue for so many years. It was impossible for Qiu Yue not to recognize him.</p><p>Furthermore, he had already given his name, but Qiu Yue still pointed her sword at him. Based on Lu Ming’s understanding of Qiu Yue, this was impossible.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes revealed that she was very quiet, as if she really did not know Lu Ming.</p><p>What had happened all these years?</p><p>hehe, another person who doesn’t know what’s good for him wants to get close to fairy Qiuyue. He’s asking for trouble!</p><p>&Nbsp;” isn’t that so? he’s a Toad lusting after a Swan’s flesh. Qiuyue fairy is one of the two beauties of the ancient sun sacred land. So many peerless geniuses have tried to pursue her, but they’ve all been rejected. This kid is just dreaming!</p><p>“It’s already good luck that he wasn’t killed!”</p><p>The people on the streets who had witnessed this scene sneered and looked at Lu Ming in disdain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Huang Ling walked over and asked curiously.</p><p>Based on her understanding of Lu Ming, he was not that kind of person. He would not touch a beautiful woman and be unable to move.</p><p>However, they were very curious about Lu Ming’s unusual behavior just now.</p><p>an old friend. We haven’t seen each other for more than ten years, but he doesn’t seem to recognize me at all…</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and told her about his relationship with Qiu Yue.</p><p>that’s strange. We cultivators will never forget a person. Even if we haven’t seen each other for ten thousand years, we can still recognize each other!</p><p>Long Chen said with a frown.</p><p>Cultivators had a good memory, and a person’s origin aura would not change. No matter how long it had been, one could still recognize it.</p><p>“She doesn’t know you at all. There are only two possibilities …”</p><p>Huang Ling spoke, but she stopped halfway. She wanted to say something but stopped, as if she couldn’t bear to.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and walked toward Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion after he finished speaking.</p><p>He knew what Huang Ling wanted to say.</p><p>There were only two possibilities if she didn’t know him.</p><p>The first was amnesia.</p><p>The second was to be possessed by an expert.</p><p>No matter what, something must have happened to Qiu Yue, and he would definitely find out.</p><p>Lu Ming walked very slowly as he pondered. Long Chen and Feng Ling followed behind him and did not disturb him.</p><p>After walking for a long time, they finally returned to Ouyang Wushuang’s mansion.</p><p>“Hehe, this lecher is back. He still has the face to come back!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the gate, they met a few young men from the purple flame villa. One of them sneered.</p><p>why don’t you take a piss and look at yourself in the mirror? you’re really overestimating yourself to have designs on fairy Qiuyue!</p><p>moreover, his cultivation is so low that he was sent flying by a great sage from the only sacred Hall. I really don’t know what use Prince Wushuang has in inviting such a person. He’ll just drag us down!</p><p>The other young men from the purple flame villa also sneered.</p><p>Obviously, the scene on the street was also witnessed by the geniuses of the purple flame villa. Otherwise, they would not have known so clearly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his eyes sweeping across the few people like lightning.</p><p>“Kid, who are you asking to shut up?”</p><p>One of the purple flame villa’s paragons ‘expression turned cold.</p><p>“I heard a few wild dogs barking as soon as I came back. Get lost immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming was already in a bad mood. When he came back and heard these people’s sarcasm, he naturally did not look happy.</p><p>kid, you’re just a piece of trash. If it weren’t for Prince Wushuang, I would have thrown you out long ago. How dare you act so arrogantly now? it seems like you don’t know your place if I don’t teach you a lesson!</p><p>A burly heaven’s favorite from the purple flame villa shouted coldly and stepped forward, pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This man was at the peak of the Supreme Saint realm and was a powerful heaven’s favorite. His spiritual body was a medium grade heaven spiritual body.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and pounced on his opponent like a bolt of lightning. He struck out with his palm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
