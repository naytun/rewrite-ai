For the two of them, a few miles of distance was covered in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A thousand meters away from the battlefield, the two of them hid in a pile of rocks and watched from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the figure with messy hair at one glance.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>Although they had not seen each other for more than eight years, although Lu Yuntian’s hair and beard were in a mess and he was dressed in rags, Lu Ming could still recognize him with a single glance.</p><p>This person was his father, Lu Yuntian.</p><p>damn the ten direction Sword School. They actually tortured my father like this.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“How can I save my father?”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>The omnidirectional sword sect and the Dark Moon Empire had more than ten martial ancestor realm experts in total. There were even two fourth level martial ancestor realm experts who were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>It was simply impossible to save Lu Yuntian from so many powerhouses.</p><p>It was impossible to get close. Once he got close, he would be discovered.</p><p>Moreover, even if they could get close, so what? there was no way they could take Lu Yuntian away without making a sound. Once they were discovered, they would have to face the pursuit of two parties. In the face of such a powerful force, only death would be the only outcome.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking anxiously.</p><p>After more than eight years, he had finally found his father. He was not far away now, but he could not save him.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming hated himself very much. He hated himself for being too weak.</p><p>“I can save your father.”</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing whispered.</p><p>“What? You can save my father? Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and asked.</p><p>of course it’s true. It’s up to you to believe it or not.</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at him.</p><p>“No, I believe you. I believe you. If you can really save my father, I’ll do anything you want.”</p><p>Lu Ming said sincerely.</p><p>Hmph, don’t think too much. I saved your father to prevent you from being impulsive and rushing out. If you die Here, how can I fulfill my promise and step on you? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. “How do you want to save my father? As you can see, once they find out that my father has been rescued, they will definitely stop fighting and go all out to hunt us down.”</p><p>I know a secret technique called the heavenly demonic Phantom technique. It can create an illusion that is exactly the same as your father’s. If you leave it there, I can steal Liang huanzhu and save your father.</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>“There’s such a profound secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“It’s just a small trick, you’re the one who’s ignorant.”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming with disdain. The corners of his lips curled up slightly, revealing a smug look.</p><p>“Wait for me here!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could react, Xie nianqing’s figure was like a ghost, floating forward.</p><p>A layer of black mist emanated from her body, and it was impossible to tell in the night.</p><p>Very quickly, Xie nianqing was approaching Lu Yuntian. At that moment, Lu Ming’s heart was beating so fast that it was almost in his throat.</p><p>In the end, Xie nianqing silently appeared behind Lu Yuntian. A layer of black mist began to spread towards Lu Yuntian.</p><p>The black mist moved, and Lu Yuntian’s figure disappeared without a trace. However, in the next moment, Lu Yuntian reappeared at the same spot.</p><p>However, no one noticed that Lu Yuntian, who had appeared later, had a dazed look in his eyes.</p><p>Shrouded in black mist, Xie nianqing floated toward Lu Ming at top speed. In seven to eight breaths, he was beside Lu Ming.</p><p>let’s go. My demonic apparition can only last for a moment. After that, it will disappear and the enemy will notice.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice sounded.</p><p>The black mist dissipated, revealing Xie nianqing’s figure. There was another figure, who else could it be but Lu Yuntian?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Lu Ming pulled Lu Yuntian and used the soaring steps to rush out of the wild forest with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Now was not the time to reminisce. They had to leave this place first.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming sent a message to the experts of the royal family through the thousand-mile sound transmission talisman.</p><p>The two of them were extremely fast. In the dark night, it was almost impossible to see their figures with the naked eye.</p><p>Half an hour later, the two of them were already two hundred miles away and stopped in a hidden mountain stream.</p><p>Lu Ming had discovered this mountain stream by accident when he came. It was extremely well-hidden.</p><p>The message he had sent to the imperial family’s experts was to meet here.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were not martial arts grandmasters and could not fly. If they continued to travel with Lu Yuntian, it would not take long for the martial arts grandmasters from the omnidirectional sword sect to catch up.</p><p>Only by borrowing the power of the imperial family could he save Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“The two of you are so young. Are you also here for the Martial Emperor key? I advise the two of you to give up on this idea. Qiu changkong has used all sorts of methods, but he still didn’t succeed. It’s the same for the two of you.”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yuntian glanced at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and said indifferently, ”</p><p>However, neither Xie nianqing nor Lu Ming said anything. They just stared at Lu Yuntian blankly.</p><p>Slowly, tears welled up in the corners of Lu Ming’s eyes. He said softly,”Father!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s body suddenly trembled. His originally listless eyes instantly lit up as he glared at Lu Ming.”You … What did you just call me?”</p><p>“Father, I’m Ming ‘er, father!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and wiped his face, revealing his delicate and pretty face. He had returned to his original appearance.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s face, Lu Yuntian’s body started to tremble violently.</p><p>More than eight years ago, Lu Ming was less than ten years old. In addition to his weak and sickly body, his appearance and mannerism were very different from now. However, the outline of his face would not change. Also, the feeling between father and son would not disappear.</p><p>Lu Yuntian immediately recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, Ming’ er, it’s really you. It’s really you. I’m not dreaming, am I?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s voice trembled as he stared at Lu Ming. He kept muttering under his breath, his eyes filled with surprise and disbelief.</p><p>He had never dreamed that he would meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>“Father, it’s me. Ming ‘er has come to save you.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s nose felt sour and his eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>“Haha, Ming ‘er, Ming’ er, the heavens have eyes. I can’t believe I’ll meet Ming ‘er again in my lifetime. I can die without regrets.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian let out a long sigh as tears continued to flow down his face.</p><p>A man does not shed tears easily, but it was not the time to be sad.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’ve grown so much in the blink of an eye. Let me take a good look at you.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian placed his hands on Lu Ming’s shoulders and sized him up carefully.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’re finally able to cultivate, and you’ve even become an incredible expert.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s face was filled with smiles.</p><p>“Father, you … Your cultivation level?”</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming realized that there was not a single fluctuation of true Qi on Lu Yuntian’s body. His body was weak and his blood Qi was lacking. He was even weaker than an ordinary person.</p><p>“My cultivation has long been crippled.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian chuckled.</p><p>“Crippled? who? Father, did the people from the ten direction Sword School do this? damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot, and his body exuded a sharp murderous intent.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, don’t be rash. It’s already a blessing for us to meet. The ten direction Sword School is too powerful. Let’s just forget about this.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s heart was twitching. He knew that Lu Yuntian was worried about his safety. He was afraid that he would act rashly and go against the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>“Father, who is it? Is it the entire ten direction sword sect or someone else? who is the mastermind?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
