Its power was so strong that it was shocking.</p><p>Feng Wuji also let out a long howl and slashed out a shocking sword radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying shockwaves rumbled in the air, the space around them trembled violently under the sword Qi. After that, Feng Wuji was forced back, his body trembled and a trickle of blood flowed down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Feng Wuji is injured, Feng Wuji has lost!”</p><p>&Nbsp; instantly, the area around Sunset Peak began to ring out with thunderous cries.</p><p>Countless people were shouting in excitement.</p><p>The other five of the scorching sun’s six heroes finally had a winner.</p><p>Guan Hong defeated Feng Wuji.</p><p>the Shifang Sword School is too strong. Not only is Qiu changkong suppressing everyone, even Guan Hong is so strong.</p><p>the number one sect in the burning sun Empire is indeed worthy of its name. In the future, the ten direction Sword School will be even stronger!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>“Feng Wuji, you’re only so-so!”</p><p>Guan Hong’s figure was majestic as he stood in the air and said proudly.</p><p>Feng Wuji’s face turned dejected, he sighed and said, ” “Guan Hong, I didn’t expect your Shi to be at the major accomplishment stage. My defeat is not an injustice.”</p><p>Feng Wuji, in my opinion, you are not qualified to be on the same level as me. The six heroes of the scorching sun shall be changed to five heroes from now on. Guan Hong smiled proudly.</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone’s expression changed drastically, especially Feng Wuji’s.</p><p>Guan Hong’s words were basically kicking Feng Wuji out of the six heroes of the burning sun. If that was really the case, Feng Wuji wouldn’t be the only one affected, but the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s reputation would take a huge hit, and some geniuses might not even choose to join the mystical sword sect in the future.</p><p>“Guan Hong, you were just lucky to win against brother Feng by one move. What are you so arrogant for?”</p><p>A loud roar came from the side.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and realized that there were a few people standing in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming was distracted by the battle between Feng Wuji and Guan Hong earlier and did not pay much attention to them. He only noticed them now.</p><p>There were a total of four people. Lu Ming had seen three of them at the emperor’s birthday banquet. They were the other three of the six heroes of the scorching sun.</p><p>Ling Yanchi of the Crimson Cloud Valley. He was the one who had spoken just now.</p><p>There was also Shangguan Yi of the ghost moon saber sect and Zuo Lian of the heavenly fiend sect.</p><p>There was another person who was very young, only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. He was carrying a broad sword on his back and standing proudly.</p><p>Guan Hong’s eyes turned to Ling Yanchi.</p><p>“Guan Hong, this time you said you wanted to challenge me and brother Feng. Now it’s my turn. I won’t take advantage of you. You can start meditating now. When you’ve recovered, we’ll fight.”</p><p>Ling Yanchi continued.</p><p>“Ling Yanchi, who said I wanted to fight you? The one who is dealing with you is someone else.”</p><p>Guan Hong laughed coldly.</p><p>“Someone else?”</p><p>Ling Yanchi was stunned and could not help but look at Shangguan Jie and Zuo Lian.</p><p>“Ling Yanchi, you’re looking at the wrong place. I’m the one fighting you!”</p><p>The young man with a sword on his back stepped forward and said arrogantly.</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Ling Yanchi was stunned.</p><p>Everyone else in the audience was stunned.</p><p>It was obvious that this young man was a disciple of the ten directions Sword School, but almost no one knew him.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect actually wanted to let an unknown youth fight against Ling Yanchi?</p><p>Was this arrogance or humiliation?</p><p>“Hahaha, Guan Hong, are you sure he has the right to fight me?”</p><p>Ling Yanchi’s eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>“We’ll know whether you’re qualified or not after the battle.”</p><p>Guan Hong sneered.</p><p>“The six heroes of the scorching sun will be replaced from now on.”</p><p>The young man said arrogantly.</p><p>“Haha, kid, you’re very confident, aren’t you?” Ling Yanchi was so angry that he laughed.</p><p>it’s not confidence, it’s strength. Remember, the one who defeated you is Qiu changlie!</p><p>The young man let out a long cry, and his aura burst out. The combat sword on his back automatically unsheathed, and he flew into the sky, slashing at Ling Yanchi.</p><p>This sword caused the heavens and earth to shake. It was terrifying.</p><p>In an instant, the expressions of most of the people present changed, and they were extremely shocked.</p><p>This was because this sword was too powerful.</p><p>In the sky, Ling Yanchi’s expression became extremely serious. His body emitted heat waves. A battle spear appeared in his hand. With a wave of the spear, a giant flaming Eagle formed and attacked Qiu changlie.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Ling Yanchi and Qiu changlie were forced back. Then, they roared in anger and started to fight again.</p><p>“He’s too strong. Who exactly is this Qiu changlie? Before, he was unknown, but his battle strength was so strong that he could actually fight with Ling Yanchi!”</p><p>I’m afraid he’s a genius secretly trained by the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>On Sunset Peak, countless people were watching the battle in the sky and discussing it.</p><p>In the sky, Feng Wuji, Shangguan Yi and the others also had a serious expression on their faces.</p><p>On the other hand, Guan Hong’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The explosions continued, and in the blink of an eye, a hundred moves had passed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering sound was heard. Then, a figure flew back.</p><p>It was Ling Yanchi.</p><p>The entire place fell silent. Could it be that Ling Yanchi had lost?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ling Yan’s Red hind legs moved a thousand meters before he stopped.</p><p>He stood still in the void, unmoving.</p><p>All of a sudden, Ling Yanchi’s body trembled, and an arrow of blood shot out from his chest.</p><p>At this moment, everyone saw that there was a long sword wound on Ling Yanchi’s chest.</p><p>He had lost. Ling Yanchi had lost. He had lost at the hands of an unknown youth from the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>The setting sun Peak was in an uproar. This news was like a whirlwind, spreading from the setting sun Peak to the entire Imperial City.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect was too strong. First, it was Guan Hong who defeated Feng Wuji. Then, a young man emerged and defeated one of the six heroes, Ling Yanchi.</p><p>It was too shocking. From now on, the structure of the younger generation of the scorching sun sect would undergo a substantial change.</p><p>Were they excluding Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi? Or should he add another person?</p><p>No matter what, the reputation of the ten direction Sword School would reach its peak.</p><p>In the sky, Ling Yanchi’s body trembled slightly, and his eyes revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>“I told you to remember that the one who defeated you was Qiu changlie.”</p><p>Qiu changlie laughed arrogantly. The corner of his mouth revealed a hint of disdain.</p><p>“Brother Ling, are you alright?”</p><p>Feng Wuji appeared beside Ling Yan’s naked body and injected a stream of true Qi into him.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Ling Yanchi smiled sadly.</p><p>Feng Wuji sighed. Today, he and Ling Yanchi were completely defeated. It was conceivable that in the future, the reputation of the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley would fall while the ten directions sword sect would rise even more.</p><p>wonderful, wonderful! The heroes of the ten direction Sword School are really admirable!</p><p>Zuo Lian from heavenly fiend sect clapped his hands and walked out. He then looked at Shangguan Yan and said, ” “Brother Shangguan, since you’re here today, why don’t we have a fight?”</p><p>“Let’s fight!”</p><p>Shangguan Yan was very direct as he stared at Zuo Lian.</p><p>The crowd was extremely excited. Another two of the six heroes of the scorching sun were about to battle.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any warning, Shangguan Yan and Zuo Lian started fighting. The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>“Ming Feng, you stay here. I’ll be leaving first.”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Ming Feng.</p><p>“Ah? Big brother tianyun, the battle isn’t over yet.” Ming Feng was extremely surprised.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
