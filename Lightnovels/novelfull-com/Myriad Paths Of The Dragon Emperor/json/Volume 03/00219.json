The crooked-mouth young man’s sword Qi was extremely sharp. With a slash of his sword, he directly cut off the head of the White Dragon.</p><p>Baichi’s expression changed drastically, and he kept waving his palms.</p><p>White Snake dragon palm. One palm can transform into ten Dragons.</p><p>Ten giant Dragons danced in the air.</p><p>“Nine Heavens howling sword!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man slashed out with his sword, and the sword Qi whistled as it collided with the White Dragon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With ten consecutive explosions, the White dragons were defeated one by one.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man waved his sword, and a series of crystal-clear sword Qi shot toward bai chi.</p><p>White Dragon Snake transformation palm, double the palm force!</p><p>Baichi roared and waved his palms again.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The giant white Dragon roared and suddenly condensed into twenty giant white dragons. They roared and pounced on the crooked-mouthed young man.</p><p>After a period of hard work, bai Chi’s martial arts technique had improved and he could now shoot out twenty white giant Dragons. He had wanted to take revenge on Ming Cheng and Lu Ming but he was forced to use it now.</p><p>“Is this your limit? What a disappointment!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man let out a long howl. He became one with his sword and soared into the sky.</p><p>Wherever the sword Qi passed, the White dragons collapsed one by one.</p><p>arghh! bai chi screamed and his body was thrown back. He fell heavily on the ground and coughed up blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s figure moved and landed on the observing pillar where bai chi was.</p><p>haha, from now on, this gazing-upon pillar belongs to the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man laughed.</p><p>“Damn it, get down.”</p><p>The Royal disciple from before shouted.</p><p>“Hehe hehe, then you should also give up your clairvoyant pillar!”</p><p>At this moment, another disciple of the ten directions Sword School rushed out and pounced on the disciple of the royal family.</p><p>BOOM! Boom …</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>This Royal disciple was stronger than bai chi, but the disciple of the ten direction Sword School was also very terrifying. In just a dozen moves, the Royal disciple was sent flying while vomiting blood.</p><p>Another viewing pillar was seized by the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Is this the genius of the ten direction Sword School?”</p><p>Everyone in the general Star Hall thought in despair.</p><p>On the side of the ten direction Sword School, the geniuses standing on the gazing-upon pillars had yet to make a move. Just a few geniuses with unknown rankings had defeated two of the top ten experts of the general Star Hall’s outer hall in a row, and it had been a one-sided battle.</p><p>This caused everyone in the general stars Hall to be dumbstruck and lose all morale.</p><p>The difference was too great. If he entered the blood ant secret realm, how could he fight against the other party?</p><p>Moreover, the other party had three times the number of people from the general Star Hall.</p><p>what top ten experts? they’re all trash. I think I’ll just sweep them all the way!</p><p>The crooked mouth youth was extremely arrogant as he looked at the other eight of the top ten experts of the general Star Hall with disdain.</p><p>The eight people’s faces changed slightly.</p><p>Even the strongest few people had grave expressions.</p><p>Even if they were confident that they could defeat the crooked-mouthed young man, they were afraid that the ten direction sword sect would send someone stronger. That would be troublesome.</p><p>Therefore, none of them made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged at the side, watching indifferently.</p><p>He had just joined the general stars Hall and did not have much sense of belonging to it. No matter how much the Shifang sword sect looked down on the general stars Hall, he was not interested in taking action.</p><p>His main purpose here was to obtain the blood ant eggs in exchange for the blood refinement pills.</p><p>He didn’t want to get into trouble for no reason.</p><p>don’t be so arrogant. There’s someone in my general stars Hall who can definitely sweep you all away!</p><p>Baichi suddenly shouted from the side.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Everyone was stunned and looked at Baichi.</p><p>He didn’t understand why Baichi suddenly became so strong and dared to speak to the people of the ten directions Sword School like this.</p><p>“Brat, are you looking for a beating?”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man looked at bai chi.</p><p>I’m telling the truth, ” Baichi said through gritted teeth. no matter how strong your school is, you can’t defeat this man.</p><p>“Who are you talking about? Tell him to get out here!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man shouted coldly.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Bai chi suddenly pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In an instant, everyone’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. This bai chi actually wanted to kill someone with a borrowed knife. He deserved to be killed!</p><p>“It’s him. His name is tianyun, a peerless genius of the general Star Hall. He can definitely kill you within ten moves.”</p><p>Baichi shouted at the crooked-mouth young man.</p><p>“Killing me in ten moves? what a joke. I think you’re crazy. Fine, open your dog eyes and watch carefully. Let’s see how he can kill me in ten moves.”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man sneered. He then looked at Lu Ming and pointed his sword at him.”Brat, come out and fight me!”</p><p>The corners of Baichi’s mouth curled into a sneer, and his eyes flashed with pride.</p><p>He secretly admired himself for pulling Lu Ming into the water with just a few words.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to die against the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>Bai chi sneered.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he slowly got up.</p><p>Although he did not want to cause trouble, he was not afraid of trouble.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>This was the first sentence that Lu Ming said to the crooked-mouthed youth.</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man thought he had heard wrong.</p><p>idiot, that idiot is obviously using you to deal with me. It’s so obvious, and you can see it. What are you if not an idiot? ”</p><p>Lu Ming chided, as if he was chiding a child.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s face suddenly turned ashen. His already crooked mouth became even more crooked as he roared, ” you’re looking for death, kid. You’re dead, you piece of sh * t. I don’t care what the reason is, but you’re dead because of what you said.</p><p>that idiot was right about one thing. I only need ten moves to kill you. No, three moves is enough.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Not far away, bai chi was gritting his teeth. Lu Ming kept calling him an idiot. He was so used to it that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Hmph, tianyun, you dare to be so arrogant in front of the ten direction Sword School? let’s see how you die!”</p><p>Baichi roared in his heart.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man roared. His killing intent exploded. He could no longer bear it and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sword howl!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man’s first move was a killing move. The dazzling and crystal-like sword Qi slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. The demon subduing spear appeared in his hand and he swept the spear forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the spear swept past, the space trembled violently. The air exploded with a terrifying sound. Due to the Spear’s speed being too fast, the friction with the air brought about scorching flames.</p><p>Before the long spear arrived, the terrifying force of the Qi explosion had already destroyed the crooked-mouthed youth’s sword Qi.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s pupils contracted sharply, revealing a sense of fear. His body moved back frantically, and at the same time, his battle sword rotated rapidly, displaying that kind of defensive sword technique.</p><p>At this moment, the faces of the geniuses of the ten direction Sword School who were standing on the observing pillars all changed.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>“I didn’t expect the general stars Hall to have a decent genius!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian’s eyes showed a trace of interest, but it was just a little bit.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear struck the sword circle formed by the crooked-mouthed youth.</p><p>In an instant, a shrill and unpleasant rumbling sound was heard.</p><p>Then, the crooked mouth young man’s eyes popped out and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body retreated rapidly.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
