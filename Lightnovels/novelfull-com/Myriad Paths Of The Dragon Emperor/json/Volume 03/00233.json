Lu Ming was simply a lunatic. He was so audacious that he even dared to kill yang Zaitian, let alone them.</p><p>If he were to be killed because of this, it would not be worth it.</p><p>Someone took off his storage ring and threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept it with his essential Qi.</p><p>Since someone took the lead, the rest could only follow suit and take off their rings, passing them to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, there were also people who were reluctant to do so. They gritted their teeth in pain and were on the verge of tears.</p><p>This storage ring could be said to contain all of his accumulated wealth. Who would be willing to hand it over like this?</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s gaze turned to them, they were shocked. They gritted their teeth and took off their storage rings, handing them to Lu Ming with trembling hands.</p><p>one hundred and eighty-five, one hundred and eighty-six …</p><p>As Lu Ming kept them, he counted them. He felt so good that he could not even open his eyes.</p><p>The disciples of the ten direction sword sect looked like they were about to cry. They gritted their teeth so hard that they almost broke.</p><p>Everyone in the general Star Hall looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>Not long after, the last disciple from the ten directions sword sect handed the storage ring to Lu Ming, who put it away with satisfaction.</p><p>alright, you can get lost now. This blood ant nest is mine. I’ll kill whoever I see.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect felt as if they had been granted Amnesty, and they turned to run.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, not a single one had run away.</p><p>In the distance, countless disciples of the ten directions Sword School growled, ” “Quick, let’s find a place to recuperate and then hunt the blood ants. Otherwise, we’ll lose everything we’ve invested.”</p><p>damn it! That’s my storage ring! Tianyun! That damned tianyun! Once we leave the blood ant realm, I’ll definitely kill him!</p><p>Many disciples of the ten directions sword sect rushed into the distance with great resentment. They seized the time to heal their injuries and kill the blood ants.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the people from the general Star Hall.</p><p>“Brother Mingcheng, how about exploring the blood ant nest with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“I can’t ask for more.”</p><p>Ming Cheng was overjoyed.</p><p>“As for you guys, get lost immediately!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming looked at the other students of the general Hall.</p><p>These people weren’t good people either. Just now, they just wanted to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight.</p><p>“Tianyun, we’re both from the general stars Hall. You can’t be so overbearing, right? He’s going to occupy the blood ant nest alone.”</p><p>A student from the general stars Hall said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Nonsense, so what if I’m this overbearing? If you’re not convinced, then let’s fight.”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>The young man was stunned.</p><p>What a joke. Wasn’t it courting death to exchange two moves with Lu Ming?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The others were helpless and could only turn around and leave.</p><p>Soon, only Lu Ming and Ming Cheng were left in the place.</p><p>“Brother Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and strode forward.</p><p>When he arrived at the edge of the blood ant nest, he discovered that there were hundreds of blood ants crawling around.</p><p>It was obvious that the battle just now had been too shocking and had completely alarmed the blood ants.</p><p>As Lu Ming and Ming Cheng walked over, the blood ants let out a strange cry and pounced at them.</p><p>However, the highest level of these blood ants was only sixth grade third level. How could they be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Soon, the ground was covered with the corpses of blood ants. The two of them then charged into the blood ant nest.</p><p>In the blood ant nest, there were many intersecting passageways.</p><p>The two of them didn’t even need to identify the direction. They simply charged forward and killed as many blood ants as they could.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming had already killed more than two hundred blood ants and harvested more than a thousand blood ant eggs.</p><p>Ming city’s harvest wasn’t small either. They had around 200.</p><p>The two of them went around and around, not knowing how far they had gone.</p><p>Suddenly, the area in front of him opened up, and a huge underground cave appeared.</p><p>The moment they arrived at the cave, the two of them were immediately stunned.</p><p>Blood ant eggs. A large number of blood ant eggs were piled up in the cave. Each of them was red and translucent, like garbage.</p><p>These were all shed by the blood ants.</p><p>Blood ant eggs were not the eggs of the blood ant’s offspring. Instead, they were energy crystals that contained powerful blood essence.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ How many of these blood ant eggs are there?”</p><p>Ming Cheng was dumbfounded.</p><p>“This? There should be at least tens of thousands of them, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little stunned.</p><p>A burning light flashed in the eyes of the two.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>At this time, a sharp cry was heard.</p><p>The two of them then realized that there was a huge creature in the middle of the cave.</p><p>It was a huge blood ant that was at least ten meters tall.</p><p>Its stomach was huge, and there were strings of blood ant eggs hanging on it. At a glance, there were at least a few hundred of them.</p><p>The mother ant!</p><p>This was the mother blood ant.</p><p>Just now, the two of them had been attracted by the countless blood ant eggs and had almost forgotten about the existence of the mother ant.</p><p>The mother ant stared at the two of them with its huge eyes and let out a sharp cry.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>From the side of the cave, a loud sound of air being torn rang out. A strong and sharp force was coming towards Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a blood ant, but it was as large as a water buffalo. Its entire body was fiery red, crystal clear, and bright like red jade.</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Lu Ming raised his gun and swept it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, the blood ant was forced back, but Lu Ming felt his body go numb and took a few steps back.</p><p>what a powerful force! These are blood ants of Class 9 Lv 3!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, another blood ant rushed out from another cave on the other side of the cave. This blood ant was no smaller than the previous one, and it exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>“Brother Ming, you can leave first.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ming Cheng nodded without any hesitation, then turned around and ran toward the tunnel behind him.</p><p>He knew that he had no way of fighting back against the ninth grade third level blood ants. He would only be a burden to Lu Ming if he stayed.</p><p>“Now, let’s have a good fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He shook the demon subduing spear and let out a buzzing sound. He rushed out and attacked the blood ants.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The demon subduing spear shot out with the power of wind and Fire, its might shocking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear collided with the blood ant’s claws, causing a violent tremor and a loud rumbling sound to echo in the cave.</p><p>After this blood ant was forced back, the next one rushed up.</p><p>The two ninth grade third level blood ants joined forces and launched a frenzied attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his cultivation to the maximum and activated the power of wind and Fire to fight the two blood ants.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The mother ant shrieked and dragged its huge body as it charged at Lu Ming. Its long, sharp claws were like blades as it slashed at Lu Ming. Its power was shocking and was not any weaker than the two blood ants.</p><p>Obviously, the Queen ant also had the combat strength of a class 9 Lv 3.</p><p>Three blood ants with the combat strength of ninth grade third level attacked Lu Ming at the same time, giving him immense pressure.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>With a single thought, three ancient shields appeared around Lu Ming.</p><p>After two months of hard work in the God Wind Valley, his ancient shield technique had reached the third level, and he could now form three ancient shields.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blood ants ‘claws struck the ancient shield, making clanging sounds, but they couldn’t break it.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
