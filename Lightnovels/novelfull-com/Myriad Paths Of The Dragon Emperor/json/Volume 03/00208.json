The lower the level, the denser the fire-element spiritual Qi.</p><p>It was said that the further down one went, the more spiritual Qi there was, the deeper it would be.</p><p>These 13 floors were not natural. The burning sun royal family had spent a lot of manpower to excavate them.</p><p>However, even after exhausting all his efforts, he could only dig out the 13th layer. It was impossible to continue down.</p><p>It was because no one could go down. It was said that the last two levels were opened up by a peerless martial King of the ancient burning sun Empire’s royal family. No one else could even go down.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard this from Ming Feng.</p><p>What was below the 13th floor? countless people in the burning sun Empire were wondering, but no one knew the answer.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He sat cross-legged, activated the true war Dragon technique, and began cultivating.</p><p>The surrounding fire-type spiritual energy was absorbed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The hot fire-property spiritual Qi was constantly being transformed into genuine Qi. The hot aura could also refine the genuine Qi, making it more condensed.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the cultivation speed here was more than twenty times faster than the outside.</p><p>One day of cultivation here was equivalent to more than 20 days of cultivation outside. Although the cost of 80 runes was terrifying, which was more than 2400 spiritual crystals, the effect was worth it.</p><p>This was especially so for martial artists who needed to break through their bottlenecks. If they came here, they would have a higher chance of breaking through their bottlenecks.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was at the sixth level, the speed at which it devoured and absorbed spiritual energy was not inferior to that of a ninth level Blood Meridian. It was at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his spirit-devouring bloodline and his body was like a Whirlpool, constantly devouring the spirit Qi of heaven and earth around him.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>Circulating his essential Qi, the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s meridians transformed into tangible Little Dragons that swam in his meridians.</p><p>The vortex in his dantian was spinning continuously, like a Nebula.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p>A few hours later, on the second level of the earth cave.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, Liu Mazi’s eyes lit up and he shouted.</p><p>The others all looked towards the entrance.</p><p>Two figures walked in.</p><p>One of them was Bai Long.</p><p>At this moment, one of Bai Long’s hands was wrapped in a thick layer of bandages.</p><p>Next to Bai Long was a young man with a cold expression and a 50 – 60% resemblance to Bai Long.</p><p>“Baichi, Baichi really came.”</p><p>Liu Mazi and the others looked at the young man with deep respect.</p><p>Bai chi, one of the top ten experts of the outer hall, was a peak sixth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>However, his combat strength was extremely terrifying. He could easily kill a seventh grade great Martial Master, and many inner hall students were no match for him.</p><p>He was a top genius.</p><p>They simply couldn’t compare to him.</p><p>Bai chi glanced at Liu Mazi and the others, then went to the third floor.</p><p>“Let’s go down and take a look!”</p><p>Liu Mazi gritted his teeth and followed him down to the third floor. The others also followed.</p><p>When bai chi and the others arrived at the third floor, they saw that there was no one there.</p><p>“Speak, where’s that little bastard?”</p><p>Bai Long’s eyes were extremely cold as he stared at Liu Mazi and the others.</p><p>“F * ck, we didn’t know. We were also chased away by that kid.”</p><p>Liu Mazi’s face changed.</p><p>“Looks like he’s already in a secret room to train. Second brother, do you still remember which secret room it was?”</p><p>Bai Chi’s voice was calm, but there was a hidden killing intent in it, causing Liu Mazi and the others to shiver.</p><p>“That room, that’s right!”</p><p>Bai Long pointed at the room that Lu Ming had opened earlier. It was also the room that Ming Feng was cultivating in.</p><p>“Good, does that kid think that hiding in the secret room will help? Even if he’s hiding inside, I’ll blast him out!”</p><p>Bai chi sneered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, he struck the stone door of the secret room with his palm.</p><p>A violent tremor was heard.</p><p>In the secret chamber, Ming Feng was cultivating. Suddenly, an earth-shaking boom sounded. His body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>“Who is it? Who’s bombarding the stone door? damn it!”</p><p>Ming Feng roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Outside, Baichi struck out with his palm again, causing the stone door to shake.</p><p>Liu Mazi and the others were shocked. Bai chi was really bold.</p><p>There was a rule in the general Star Hall that no one was allowed to bombard the door of the secret room, because doing so would easily cause the person inside to go berserk.</p><p>But now, Baichi completely ignored this rule.</p><p>This was the confidence that came with being powerful.</p><p>In the secret room, Ming Feng gritted his teeth.</p><p>However, the sounds of the attacks continued to ring out as if they were endless.</p><p>An hour later, Ming Feng couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“I’d like to see who it is. I’m going to report him to the elder!”</p><p>Ming Feng growled, opened the stone door, and walked out.</p><p>“Bai Long, you again!”</p><p>The moment he opened the stone door, Ming Feng saw Bai Long.</p><p>“You’re finally out. Why are you here? Where’s that kid? Which secret room?”</p><p>Bai Long said coldly as he stared at Ming Feng.</p><p>“Why should I tell you? also, you attacked the stone door, which is against the rules of the general Star Hall. I’m going to Sue you guys!”</p><p>Ming Feng shouted.</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, he felt a strong gust of wind coming at him.</p><p>The speed of this gust of wind was far beyond his imagination, and he could not Dodge it at all.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Ming Feng’s face received a heavy slap.</p><p>Ming Feng’s body flew out.</p><p>“You talk too much. Tell me, which secret room is that kid in?”</p><p>Baichi asked coldly as he withdrew his palm.</p><p>“F * ck, I don’t know!”</p><p>Ming Feng struggled to get up and shouted.</p><p>“You don’t know? You still dare to be stubborn?”</p><p>Baichi’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>His body moved and he appeared beside Ming Feng. He stepped on Ming Feng’s face, causing his face to collide with the stone slab.</p><p>“Do you know now?” Bai chi asked indifferently.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Ming Feng roared like a wild beast and struggled in anger, shouting, ” I said I don’t know, so I really don’t know. If you have the guts, kill me today. Otherwise, I’ll definitely take revenge.</p><p>“Big brother, looks like he didn’t lie. I’ve checked the secret chamber that was opened here, and it wasn’t open for long. I guess that kid went down.”</p><p>Bai Long said.</p><p>“He went down?”</p><p>Bai chi frowned.</p><p>It would be troublesome if they went further down because they did not know which secret room Lu Ming had entered.</p><p>Without knowing which secret room it was, he didn’t dare to randomly attack.</p><p>This was especially true from the fourth level onwards, where everyone was an expert. If he made a mistake and provoked other experts, things would become troublesome.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bai chi kicked Ming Feng away and said in disdain, ” a master realm ant wants to seek revenge from me? fine, I’ll be waiting for you!</p><p>After he finished speaking, he looked at Liu Mazi and the others and ordered, ” “You guys, stay here and guard. When you see that kid come out, report to me immediately.”</p><p>“This mo …”</p><p>Liu Mazi and the others hesitated.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to refuse?”</p><p>Bai chi stared at Liu Mazi and the others with an unfriendly look, and his voice turned cold.</p><p>no, no, we’ll definitely stay here. As soon as that kid comes out, we’ll report to you immediately!</p><p>Liu Mazi hurriedly nodded in agreement.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Bai chi nodded and left with Bai Long.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
