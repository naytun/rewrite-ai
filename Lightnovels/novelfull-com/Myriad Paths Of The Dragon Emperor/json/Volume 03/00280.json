He kept it and continued to consume the blood refinement pills.</p><p>Two days later, the remaining blood refinement pills were all refined by Lu Ming. A blood-red glow shot up from Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to break through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He felt that it was not enough. He still needed to continue refining treasures such as blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing was sitting cross-legged. The blood-red glow on his spine was even thicker than Lu Ming’s and there was a terrifying fluctuation.</p><p>He did not refine as many blood refinement pills as Lu Ming, but his energy fluctuations were stronger than Lu Ming’s. This was due to his talent.</p><p>After a while, the blood light disappeared and a terrifying fluctuation was hidden. Xie nianqing opened his eyes.</p><p>“Do you have any more blood refinement pills?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked the first question after finishing his cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming spread his hands. I don’t have any more. I think it’s too little!</p><p>then go and kill them. The others must have a lot of blood refining crystals.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Then, the two of them left the place, chose a direction, and ran away.</p><p>Two hours later, the two of them stopped at a barren mountain.</p><p>The two of them felt that the second bloodline that had not been awakened was throbbing, as if it was attracted by something.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>The two of them headed in that direction.</p><p>Ten miles away, a boundless Stone Forest appeared.</p><p>Stone pillars stood tall and upright. These stone pillars were carved into various shapes, such as tigers, lions, and wolves.</p><p>There were even carvings of humans, true dragons, and so on.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Many figures appeared in the surroundings and quickly rushed toward the Stone Forest.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the Stone Forest, there were constant rumbles. It was obvious that someone was fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at each other and rushed toward the Stone Forest.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At the side, a first level martial arts Grandmaster youth charged towards Lu Ming and was pierced through the heart by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>The young man’s eyes were wide open in disbelief even as he died.</p><p>Lu Ming was now infinitely close to becoming a martial arts Grandmaster. He could be considered half a step away from becoming a Grandmaster. He was much stronger than before.</p><p>Lu Ming could kill an ordinary first level martial arts Grandmaster in one move.</p><p>As soon as the young man died, his blood, Qi, and essence were all condensed into blood refining crystals. There were 16 of them, and Lu Ming collected them. At the same time, essential Qi gushed out and Lu Ming took the young man’s storage ring.</p><p>As they continued to move forward, many people wanted to attack Lu Ming and Xie nianqing along the way, but they were all killed mercilessly by the two of them.</p><p>“The combination of my Wind and Fire Force is extremely powerful, but it’s only a combination and can’t be completely fused. If the two forces can be completely fused, the power will be even more shocking,”</p><p>“But how can I completely fuse the two types of Shi? If it works, then it’ll be my trump card.”</p><p>As Lu Ming fought, he was thinking.</p><p>Soon, the two of them had covered a distance of ten miles, and the attraction to the bloodline was even stronger.</p><p>Not long after, a pit appeared in front of them. All kinds of patterns were engraved around the pit.</p><p>The two of them walked into the pit and immediately felt their blood run cold.</p><p>In the pit, there were piles of white bones of all kinds of creatures, human-shaped, and demonic beasts.</p><p>Between the bones, there were blood-red crystals that gave off a blood-red glow.</p><p>Blood refining crystals. They were all blood refining crystals.</p><p>The thing that attracted their bloodline was the blood refining crystal.</p><p>This wasn’t left behind in the present, but in ancient times.</p><p>this place is a burial ground, and it’s also a place for ancient sacrificial offerings!</p><p>Xie nianqing seemed to be talking to himself as his voice trembled.</p><p>blood refining crystals, they’re blood refining crystals. These are all mine.</p><p>Many figures appeared in the surroundings, their eyes burning with fire as they looked down.</p><p>“Yours? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A few figures jumped into the pit and started fighting in the air.</p><p>At this moment, ku Luming and Xie nianqing had also jumped into the pit.</p><p>Immediately, someone attacked him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a human path palm print and smashed the first level martial arts Grandmaster into a meat patty, which was then condensed into a blood refining crystal in the air.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also extremely powerful. A Black Lotus flew out and beheaded a first level martial ancestor realm expert.</p><p>As soon as the two of them landed, their true energy gushed out and swept away the blood refining crystals.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming had collected hundreds of blood refining crystals.</p><p>There were still many of them as far as the eye could see. Some of them were even buried in the bone banner.</p><p>“Keep, keep!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing collected them to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>When the others saw this, their eyes turned red. They all stopped and rushed down to fight for the blood refining crystals.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>At this time, a blade light suddenly slashed down from above.</p><p>Screams rang out as five or six young men were killed in one strike.</p><p>Then, a young man with disheveled hair and a saber on his back appeared above the pit.</p><p>“Zhao Hong, it’s Zhao Hong! Hurry up and run!”</p><p>The remaining people were shocked and quickly flew into the sky, wanting to escape. However, the next moment, a Saber Light flashed, and those people were all cut in half in the air.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Zhao Hong glanced at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing in the pit and then slashed down.</p><p>The blade light was pale and the killing intent was as cold as the winter snow, enveloping the two of them.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing shouted and joined forces to fight the enemy.</p><p>In the face of such a strong enemy, there was no need to hesitate. They could only join forces.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing retreated backward.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Zhao Hong’s gaze flickered and he was slightly surprised, I didn’t expect two great martial masters to be able to block my blade. It’s rare in this world. But today, you’ll still die.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Zhao Hong’s body, and a Saber Light shot up into the sky like a waterfall.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Then, he slashed down.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not even think and immediately retreated.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhao Hong’s blade slashed at the thousands of bones in the pit. The bones instantly shattered and shot out in all directions. Blood refining crystals flew into the sky and then fell back down.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a change occurred.</p><p>From the pit, under the thousands of white bones, a shocking roar suddenly came out.</p><p>A terrifying, baleful aura surged out from under the White bones.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the White bones in the pit exploded, and a living being rushed out.</p><p>This living being had a human form and was three meters tall. It was covered in green hair, had long and sharp nails, and had fangs in its mouth.</p><p>“Blood corpse!”</p><p>This living being was exactly the same as the blood corpse that Lu Ming and the rest had encountered in the blood Realm’s demonic cave.</p><p>The only difference was that this blood corpse’s eyes were golden, and the aura it gave off was much stronger than the blood corpses he had encountered in the blood Realm and Devil’s Den.</p><p>A fiendish aura filled the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As soon as the Golden-eyed blood corpse appeared, it pounced towards Zhao Hong. Its claws were as sharp as blades as it tried to grab Zhao Hong.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
