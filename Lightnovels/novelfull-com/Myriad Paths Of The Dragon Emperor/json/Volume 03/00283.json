At his spine, there was an extremely rich blood-red light, as if something was about to break out of his body.</p><p>“Awaken!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A bloody light exploded at his spine, and an object condensed.</p><p>It was actually a stone tablet. The stone tablet was ten meters tall and was suspended above Lu Ming’s head. There seemed to be some words on the stone tablet, but they were blurry and unclear.</p><p>“This is my second bloodline? It was actually a stone tablet? Could it be a special bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone tablet trembled, and a silver chakra emerged.</p><p>The silver chakra represented a King-level bloodline.</p><p>A silver chakra represented a first class King-level bloodline.</p><p>However, it was not over yet. The stone tablet shook again, and the second silver chakra emerged, followed by the third.</p><p>After the third silver chakra appeared, there were no more chakra.</p><p>The third level King level Blood Meridian was the final level of the second blood Meridian that Lu Ming had awakened.</p><p>The three silver chakra glowed and were extremely dazzling.</p><p>I’ve taken more than 6000 blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals. The bloodline I’ve awakened didn’t disappoint me.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile. He was quite satisfied.</p><p>With his talent, if he had not taken more than 6000 blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals, he would probably only be able to awaken a level 9 ordinary bloodline. It would be impossible for him to even reach the king level.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>His second blood Meridian vibrated and emitted a strong suction force. The boundless Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was absorbed by Lu Ming and transformed into essential Qi.</p><p>This was the king level bloodline, which was extremely magical. When it was first awakened, it would have a chance to madly devour the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, and then it would slowly calm down.</p><p>“I can’t waste this opportunity!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than two hundred thousand spiritual crystals appeared in the surroundings.</p><p>These spiritual crystals were obtained from killing other young masters.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The spirit crystals exploded one by one and turned into rolling energy that was constantly absorbed and refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation soared like a rocket.</p><p>It was not long before Lu Ming’s cultivation level had broken through to the early stage of the first level martial arts Grandmaster realm. However, this was not his limit and he was still increasing.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the peak of the first grade martial ancestor realm. He was only a step away from the second grade martial ancestor realm.</p><p>At this time, the second bloodline finally calmed down and stopped absorbing the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming took in a deep breath. His eyes flickered and shot out like two long Spears.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as he felt the almost endless essential Qi in his body.</p><p>However, in terms of true Qi, he was much stronger than before.</p><p>With a thought, the second bloodline was hidden.</p><p>Hmph, it’s only a third level King bloodline. What’s there to be proud of? watch me!</p><p>Xie nianqing, who had been paying attention to Lu Ming’s breakthrough, snorted and sat down cross-legged to continue refining the blood crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind. He moved his hand and took out a Jade bottle.</p><p>It was the Yiyuan ancient panaceas. He still had dozens of bottles in his hands. He planned to use the Yiyuan ancient panaceas to raise his cultivation to the second level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>When he opened the Jade bottle, the bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. He opened his mouth and sucked in all the nine Yiyuan ancient panaceas in the bottle.</p><p>The energy required to break through to the martial ancestor realm was even more terrifying. Even if there were too few Yiyuan ancient spiritual pills, they would not be of much use. Lu Ming might as well swallow the entire bottle.</p><p>As Lu Ming refined the pill, he diverted some of his attention to observe Xie nianqing.</p><p>An hour later, Xie nianqing stopped refining blood crystals and started to break through.</p><p>With Xie nianqing’s talent, breaking through to Wu Zong was not a problem.</p><p>Soon, she successfully broke through, and a terrifying essence Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>This essence Qi was not any smaller than Lu Ming’s earlier one. It caused another commotion.</p><p>The people nearby were extremely shocked. Two streaks of essence Qi shot up into the sky in a row, and each one was extremely terrifying. Could it be that there were two monstrous geniuses breaking through here?</p><p>Everyone was extremely curious.</p><p>BOOM! After Xie nianqing’s breakthrough, he began to awaken his second bloodline.</p><p>The blood light soared into the sky and was extremely dense, almost covering an area of several li.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. This blood aura was too shocking.</p><p>The momentum was so great that it was ten times stronger than before. No, it was more than that.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The blood Qi swept out and churned. An astonishing pressure spread out.</p><p>A moment later, the blood light dissipated, and a figure appeared above Xie nianqing’s head.</p><p>Yes, that’s right. Xie nianqing’s second bloodline was actually a human. It was a woman who was more than 10 meters tall, with graceful curves. She wore a Black Veil and sat cross-legged on a Black Lotus.</p><p>The woman’s appearance was unclear, but her figure was extremely good. She exuded an alluring aura everywhere, like a demoness.</p><p>The most terrifying thing that stunned Lu Ming was that the woman’s body was actually emitting seven silver chakras.</p><p>A seventh level King level bloodline. Lu Ming’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. He had a dumbfounded look on his face.</p><p>He was too shocked.</p><p>King class bloodline was extremely difficult to awaken. For example, Duanmu Lin, the genius of the Duanmu family that was said to be able to surpass Feng Wuji in the future, only had a second class king class bloodline.</p><p>Geniuses like the six heroes of the scorching sun would usually only awaken to the first level of the king class. Some people might even awaken more.</p><p>From this, one could see how terrifying a seventh level King was.</p><p>Genius, this was a true genius. Xie nianqing clearly did not refine as many blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals as Lu Ming, but the blood Meridian he awakened was much stronger than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>This was a true monster. Even if Xie nianqing did not refine the blood Crystal, he could probably awaken a fifth level King bloodline.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing opened his eyes and shouted,””Swallow!”</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The heaven and earth spiritual Qi in the area rushed towards Xie nianqing like a madman. The heaven and earth spiritual Qi in a radius of dozens of miles was stirred up, and a strong wind seemed to be blowing in the air.</p><p>“What’s going on? I can’t absorb the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth anymore.”</p><p>“The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth is being controlled by someone.”</p><p>Within a few dozen miles, exclamations rang out.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing waved his hand and a pile of spiritual crystals appeared. There were hundreds of thousands of them. All of them exploded and turned into a sea of spiritual Qi, pouring into Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation level rose rapidly. Early stage of martial ancestor realm 1-dan, middle stage of martial ancestor realm 1-dan.</p><p>Very quickly, he reached the peak of the first stage of the martial ancestor realm. However, he did not stop. With a boom, he broke through the bottleneck and broke through to the second stage of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation continued to rise until he reached the peak of the second level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“This Jiao is too terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>When he broke through, it was already extremely rare for him to make use of the power of his newly awakened bloodline to rush to the peak of the martial ancestor realm 1-dan. It was equivalent to a normal person’s years of hard work.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing was even more terrifying. He rushed straight to the peak of the second level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>This was a seventh level King bloodline.</p><p>Of course, this kind of improvement was a one-time thing. In the future, he would have to slowly cultivate.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
