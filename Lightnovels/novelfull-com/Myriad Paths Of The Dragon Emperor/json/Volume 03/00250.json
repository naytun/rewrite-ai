Why is tianyun not challenging anymore? he clearly won. If he were to challenge someone three levels above him, he would be able to obtain an additional 1000000 spirit crystals as a reward.”</p><p>that’s right, why isn’t he challenging us anymore? I’m just about to witness history.</p><p>Countless people were greatly disappointed.</p><p>Only the judge and the few elders of the Ditian battle arena were overjoyed.</p><p>tianyun, ” the judge said, suppressing his joy, ” since that’s the case, I hereby announce that you’ve won ten consecutive victories across two levels. The reward is one million spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The reason why he didn’t continue to challenge was that he could tell that if he showed off too much and earned too many spirit crystals from the Ditian battle arena, it would definitely cause the Ditian battle arena to be unhappy.</p><p>On the other hand, if he were to continue challenging, the opponent he would face would definitely be even more powerful. If that were the case, all of his trump cards would be exposed.</p><p>It was not wise to reveal all his trump cards in front of the enemy.</p><p>So, he chose to end it.</p><p>One million spiritual crystals was enough for now.</p><p>However, the audience in the arena was itching for a fight. They were all guessing whether Lu Ming would win if he continued to challenge and how many consecutive wins he would win.</p><p>Of course, there was no answer to that.</p><p>Some people felt that Lu Ming had already done his best just now. If he continued to challenge, he would definitely lose. Hence, he chose not to continue the challenge.</p><p>There were also people who felt that Lu Ming still had the strength to spare and chose not to fight for some unknown reason.</p><p>There were different opinions.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered. He followed the judge and received the reward of one million spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming left, satisfied.</p><p>Of course, there were also the three siblings from Ming city.</p><p>big brother tianyun, you’re really too amazing. If I’m half, no, one-tenth as amazing as you guys, I’d be laughing my head off even in my dreams!</p><p>Ming Feng looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said,”let’s go. What do you want to buy?” It’s my treat today.”</p><p>“It’s true!”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed. He pulled Ming Zhu and Ming Cheng and ran towards the market.</p><p>When they arrived at the market, the three Ming siblings picked from all the places and spent five to six thousand spiritual crystals. To Lu Ming, it was nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming was a millionaire now.</p><p>After that, he returned to the general stars Hall.</p><p>At the entrance of Lu Ming’s dormitory, he saw Hua Chi waiting there.</p><p>“Hua Chi, you were waiting for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve exceeded my expectations time and time again. Today, you’ve achieved ten consecutive wins across two levels, surpassing Qiu changkong’s record.”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>Of course, Ming Feng had gone to Ming city. Hence, Lu Ming was the only one there. He did not have to hold back when he spoke.</p><p>“You found out so quickly?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Right now, almost all of the higher-ups in the entire imperial capital know about it.”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. The spread speed was really terrifying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, my father wants to see you,”</p><p>Hua Chi suddenly said.</p><p>“Your father?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. Hua Chi’s father, the current Emperor of the blazing sun Empire, wanted to see him?</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. I didn’t hide your information from my father. You won’t mind, right?”</p><p>Hua Chi looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. In fact, Lu Ming had already expected this.</p><p>Since he had agreed to help Hua Chi, it was only natural for him to tell his Imperial father.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not seem to mind, Hua Chi smiled and said,”Lu Ming, I’ve told my father about your father. He’s been sending out a lot of people to investigate and it seems like there’s some progress.”</p><p>“What? Is there any news of my father?” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be happy too early. It seems like there’s only a slight lead.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Let’s go and see your Imperial father.”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait.</p><p>A little bit of information was better than no news and finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming left the general Star Hall and boarded a beast carriage with Hua Chi, heading toward the palace.</p><p>After they arrived at the palace, Lu Ming followed Hua Chi and headed straight for the Imperial garden.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the Imperial garden, he saw a middle-aged man with a burly and majestic figure. He was dressed in a Golden Dragon robe and was sitting in a Pavilion, drinking tea.</p><p>He was just sitting there casually, but he had a terrifying Majesty.</p><p>This was the majesty of an Emperor.</p><p>There was no doubt that this was the current Emperor of the burning sun Empire, Hua Zhengxing.</p><p>“Your son pays his respects to Imperial father!”</p><p>When he arrived at the pavilion, Hua Chi bowed.</p><p>“I, Lu Ming, pay my respects to Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>haha, nephew Lu Ming, no need for formalities. Come, have a drink with me!</p><p>Hua Zhengxing was very forthright as he laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Hua Chi walked in and took their seats. Beside them, the emperor’s trusted aide poured tea for Lu Ming and Hua Chi.</p><p>“I’ve long heard that nephew Lu Ming is a Dragon among men, unparalleled in the world. It’s true after seeing you today.”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing said with a smile.</p><p>“Your Majesty, you’re too kind,”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing took a sip of tea and said, ” Lu Ming, you’ve been creating miracles time and time again, but at the same time, you’ve also offended the omnidirectional swordsman. You must be careful from now on. However, since you’ve joined the general stars Hall and you’re eighth brother’s close friend, I can promise you one thing. As long as it’s a fight between peers, no matter what happens, I and the royal family will definitely stand on your side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. Hua Zhengxing was implying that as long as it was a fight between peers, he could go all out. The royal family would stand firmly behind him and protect him.</p><p>“Many thanks, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Although the royal family had declined, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. They were still powerful. With the emperor’s promise, Lu Ming would no longer have to be afraid if he encountered disciples of the ten direction Sword School in the future. He could just kill them. If the older generation of the ten direction Sword School were to make a move, the royal family would definitely step in.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming would have less to worry about.</p><p>“There’s more!”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing moved his hand and a storage ring appeared in his hand. He said,”These are blood refinement pills. There are 4000 of them.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that the blood ant eggs from the last time had been refined into blood refinement pills.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and accepted it. He deserved it.</p><p>“Your Majesty, I heard you know where my father is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He had wanted to ask since he arrived, but he had been holding it in. Now, he could not hold it in anymore.</p><p>I’ve been sending people to investigate all this time, ” Hua Zhengxing said after a moment of silence. I’ve been investigating since eight or nine years ago, and I’ve finally found some clues.</p><p>your father is most likely imprisoned by the ten direction Sword School for some reason. This is certain. Also, there is a high possibility that your father is not dead, but we have not found out where he is imprisoned.</p><p>“Father really didn’t die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Then, he was filled with endless anger.</p><p>His father had actually been imprisoned by the ten directions Sword School. Damn it, the ten directions Sword School deserved to die!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
