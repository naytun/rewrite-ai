A few young men from the ten directions Sword School had noticed him.</p><p>His voice shook the entire area.</p><p>More than fifty young men turned their heads and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>it really is tianyun! There are so many of us here, and he still dares to appear? ”</p><p>haha, he’s courting death. Let’s join forces and kill him!</p><p>The disciples of the omnipresent sword sect looked at Lu Ming with murderous eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and was very clear about the situation.</p><p>There were more than thirty young men from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>There were nearly twenty young men from the general Star Hall, and three of them were from the top ten experts of the outer hall.</p><p>“Tianyun, he’s mine.”</p><p>An eerie voice came from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>A young man in a blue robe strode out and looked at Lu Ming with a cold smile.</p><p>“Senior brother water trace!”</p><p>“Could it be that senior brother Shui liuhen is going to personally make a move? tianyun is dead for sure!”</p><p>When this young man walked out, there were exclamations from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He remembered that this young man was one of the six geniuses in the omnipresent Sword School who had comprehended the ‘control force’.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve really been blinded by greed. To think that you’d still dare to appear here. You’re really looking for death. Fine, I’ll finish you off and complete one of elder Qiu’s missions.”</p><p>Shui shuihen looked at Lu Ming and said indifferently. His tone was full of confidence as if Lu Ming was already a piece of fat meat in his mouth.</p><p>a few disciples from the ten directions Sword School told me the same thing before, but they’re already on their way.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently.</p><p>“What? Tianyun, you’ve actually killed a disciple of my ten direction Sword School. How dare you! Do you know that this is a heinous crime?”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming only said two words indifferently.</p><p>There would always be some people who felt good about themselves, as if they were the only ones who could kill others. If others resisted, they would be guilty of great crimes.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense to such a person.</p><p>“Tianyun, no matter what? If you encounter me, you’ll definitely die!”</p><p>Shui shuihen’s face turned even gloomier, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Force, the force of water!</p><p>“Cut the crap. Didn’t I say before that we’ll see who kills who?”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed the long spear in his hand and his killing intent burst forth.</p><p>At this moment, an even more intense fragrance wafted out.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit was about to ripen.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ll let you live a little longer for now. I’ll kill you after I get the flood Dragon Spirit fruit!”</p><p>Shui liuhen said coldly. He looked at the serpent spirit fruit with a burning gaze.</p><p>As long as he could obtain the flood Dragon Spirit fruit, he would be able to break through to the seventh grade great master realm.</p><p>At that time, he would not fear anyone in the blood ant secret realm, not even yang Zaitian. At that time, he would kill his way into the blood ant nest, how many blood ant eggs could he get?</p><p>Thinking of this, his heart was burning.</p><p>The blood ant secret realm would not reject those who broke through to the seventh grade Grandmaster realm in it.</p><p>“People of the general Star Hall, if you dare to make a move, I will make sure that none of you can leave this place alive.”</p><p>Shui shuihen looked at the people from the general Star Hall coldly.</p><p>Hmph, Shui liuhen, the blood ant realm doesn’t belong to your family. Anyone who sees it will have a share.</p><p>A young man from the general stars Hall said.</p><p>He was one of the top ten experts of the general stars Hall’s outer hall. As long as he got the flood dragon fruit, he would be able to break through to the seventh grade great Martial Master realm. At that time, he would no longer have to fear the people of the Shi Fang Sword School. Therefore, he was very aggressive and didn’t want to back down.</p><p>“You’re looking for death! When I get the serpent spirit fruit and break through, I’ll definitely kill all these trash from the general stars Hall!”</p><p>Shui lihen’s eyes glowed with a sinister light.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar seemed to come from the flood dragon fruit.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit shone brightly and the fragrance of medicine spread throughout the area.</p><p>After a few breaths, the light dimmed, and the medicinal fragrance also faded, becoming more restrained.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit had ripened.</p><p>“The flood dragon fruit is mine!”</p><p>go! Shui lihen roared and leaped out like an arrow, shooting towards the flood dragon fruit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The people from the general stars Hall and the other people from the ten direction Sword School also pounced toward the flood dragon fruit.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Shui shuihen roared and threw a punch. The surface of the lake exploded and water pillars formed, shooting towards the people from the general Star Hall.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Several experts from the general Star Hall joined forces to block the water pillar. However, their bodies were obstructed and they could not help but fall towards the surface of the lake.</p><p>The tips of their feet stepped on the surface of the lake to stop themselves, but the water current had already run a long distance.</p><p>“A few pieces of trash want to stop me? the flood dragon fruit is mine.”</p><p>Shui lihen sneered in his heart.</p><p>But the next moment, he was stunned.</p><p>A figure stepped in the air and leaped over his head, heading straight for the flood Dragon Spirit fruit.</p><p>“Tianyun, stop right there! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Water current scar roared.</p><p>He stomped on the surface of the water and ran forward at top speed. At the same time, he waved his palms and the nearby lake water was driven by him. It condensed into a water sword and pierced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look and swept his long spear out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A loud boom was heard. The water swords were not shattered, but Lu Ming’s body was affected by a huge force and he floated down.</p><p>“The force of water is indeed amazing, especially on the surface of this Lake.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re still trash if you haven’t comprehended force. You’re dead for sure today.”</p><p>Shui shuihen laughed out loud. A combat sword as clear as autumn water appeared in his hand. As he swung the combat sword, the water on the lake was naturally driven, forming water pillars. Together with the sword Qi, they blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s so great about comprehending force?”</p><p>A cold smile hung on the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>“What’s so great about it? ‘Haha, you’re just jealous …’ “Huh?” Ah …”</p><p>Shui shuihen’s voice trailed off.</p><p>That was because at that moment, Lu Ming’s body suddenly exploded with a light and sharp aura.</p><p>Force, the force of the wind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and there seemed to be a gust of strong wind whistling out. As the spear swept out, a tornado seemed to have formed on the lake.</p><p>Bang Bang …</p><p>The water pillar that Shui shuihen had shot out was instantly dispersed, and the powerful spear momentum blasted towards Shui shuihen.</p><p>Shui shuihen exerted all his strength and slashed with his sword, clashing with Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shui liuhen’s body was sent flying and he crashed into the lake, causing a huge splash. Shui liuhen was sent flying into the lake.</p><p>Behind him, the other disciples of the ten directions Sword School and the general stars Hall all gasped and widened their eyes.</p><p>For a moment, their figures slowed down.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The lake water splashed everywhere, and traces of water rushed out of the lake, letting out an unbelievable roar, ” “Wind force initial success, how could you possibly cultivate wind force to the initial success?”</p><p>He could sense that Lu Ming’s wind force had reached the initial success stage and was shockingly powerful.</p><p>As for his force of water, he had only just started. He did not know how far away he was from the initial success stage.</p><p>“Isn’t it just momentum? What’s so great about it, is there a need to keep talking about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
