There were six rooms that were dim.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and walked towards a secret room.</p><p>The eyes of the six young men who were sitting cross-legged in the middle lit up when they saw Lu Ming walking toward a secret chamber.</p><p>“I’ve never seen this kid before. He’s probably a hothead.”</p><p>“Could it be that they just arrived? haha, after waiting for several days, someone finally came to open the secret cultivation room. I’m going to seize it!”</p><p>The six young men thought to themselves.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun!”</p><p>Ming Feng was a little nervous as he followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, anyone who dared to occupy someone else’s Secret cultivation room here was definitely a ruthless person.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and took out nine inscription stones.</p><p>The secret room on the third floor required nine inscription stones to open.</p><p>There were a few pits on the stone door.</p><p>Lu Ming placed the nine runestones into the pit. The stone door immediately flashed with light. Then, there was a clicking sound and the stone door opened.</p><p>“Haha, this secret training room is mine.”</p><p>“You’re dreaming. I was the first to arrive here. I arrived seven days ago. This secret chamber is mine.”</p><p>“The one that came earlier was already yours? In your dreams. The secret cultivation room is the home of the strong. Get out of here immediately!”</p><p>When the door of the secret room opened, the six young men stood up and shouted one after another. They all wanted to take this secret room for themselves.</p><p>As for the thoughts of Lu Ming, the party involved, they directly ignored them.</p><p>One of them looked like he had just arrived. Who would care about his thoughts?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of weapons being unsheathed could be heard. The six of them actually pulled out their weapons and started to face each other.</p><p>“If you want to fight with me, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, one of the pockmarked young men’s aura suddenly burst out. Judging from his aura, he had actually reached the fourth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>The other five young men’s faces changed instantly.</p><p>“Liu Mazi, you’ve actually broken through to the fourth grade great Martial Master realm? When did that happen?”</p><p>A young man shouted in shock.</p><p>“Hahaha, unexpected, right? I’ve already made a breakthrough, so let’s see how you can compete with me. Get lost now, I need this secret chamber to consolidate my cultivation!”</p><p>Liu Mazi shouted coldly, and his powerful aura began to wreak havoc in the cave.</p><p>The other five people’s expressions were very unsightly, but they didn’t dare to refute.</p><p>Most of them were at the second or third grade great Martial Master realm, and they were no match for a fourth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>“Damn it, I’ve waited for seven days and finally found a hothead. It seems like I’ve waited for nothing.”</p><p>A tall young man growled unhappily. He stepped back helplessly and stood to the side.</p><p>The others were silent for a moment and then retreated.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Liu Mazi laughed arrogantly and proudly.</p><p>He then turned to look at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, I want this secret room of yours. Also, hand over all the inscription stones you have and get lost. I’m in a good mood today, so I won’t make things difficult for you.”</p><p>“Fourth grade great Martial Master?”</p><p>When Liu Mazi revealed his cultivation, Ming Feng was no longer nervous. He mumbled to himself and looked at Liu Mazi with a strange expression.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily take care of a group of third and fourth grade Grandmaster geniuses with one move. What was Liu Pozi to him?</p><p>Ming Feng had already started to mourn for Liu Mazi.</p><p>“So pitiful!”</p><p>Ming Feng muttered in his heart as he looked at Liu Mazi’s arrogant expression.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to do this? Don’t you want to think about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Liu Mazi and said with a faint smile.</p><p>nonsense, what’s there to consider? stop wasting my time!</p><p>Liu Mazi shouted.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then fine. Hand over your storage ring and get lost?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Ah? What? What did you just say?”</p><p>Liu Mazi was stunned and thought he had heard wrong.</p><p>“Hurry up, I don’t want to repeat myself.” Lu Ming said.</p><p>hahaha, brat, you still want my storage ring? I think you’re crazy. Let me cure you!</p><p>Liu Mazi laughed out loud. He took a step forward and sent a palm strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Immediately after, the others heard a loud boom and saw a figure flying backward. He fell heavily on the ground and screamed repeatedly.</p><p>It was Liu Mazi.</p><p>The other five young men were stunned.</p><p>Liu Mazi was defeated, and the key was that he was defeated too quickly. They did not even see how Liu Mazi was defeated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved like a ghost and appeared in front of Liu Mazi. He stepped on Liu Mazi’s face, causing his face to fall heavily to the ground.</p><p>Liu Mazi screamed.</p><p>The other five young men felt a chill run down their spines and their teeth hurt.</p><p>expert, so he’s a top expert. Thank God I didn’t make a move just now!</p><p>it’s all Liu Mazi’s fault. If it wasn’t for him, I would be the one in trouble. I have to thank Liu Mazi …</p><p>The other five young men secretly rejoiced, their palms sweating.</p><p>“Now, hand over your storage ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at Liu Mazi and said indifferently.</p><p>“I’ll pay, I’ll pay!”</p><p>Liu Mazi shrieked in pain and handed the storage ring to Lu Ming while trembling.</p><p>He simply wanted to die. He originally thought that he had picked up a bargain, but in the end, he suffered a double loss. What a terrible loss.</p><p>I won’t come and occupy the secret room anymore. It’s too much!</p><p>Liu Mazi screamed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming took the storage ring and moved his feet away.”Get lost!”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Liu Mazi rolled and crawled, struggling to get up, and was about to go up.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>At this moment, the door of a secret room opened.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, a figure came out of it.</p><p>It was a man in his twenties. He was wearing a black robe and had a cold expression. The moment he came out, he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>“Bai Long, it’s Bai Long!”</p><p>The other young men’s expressions changed drastically when they saw the black-robed young man.</p><p>who has the inscription stone? hand it over now. My time in the secret room is up. I need to continue cultivating and break through a martial technique!</p><p>Bai Long shouted, his eyes like lightning, and he didn’t hide his powerful aura at all.</p><p>A fifth grade great Martial Master! This young man was actually a fifth grade great Martial Master!</p><p>Suddenly, Bai Long’s gaze landed on the secret room behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, the secret room that just opened is perfect for me to use.”</p><p>Then, he strode towards the secret room.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his feet slightly and stood in front of Bai Long.”This secret chamber is mine.”</p><p>Bai Long was stunned. He sized Lu Ming up and a cold smile appeared on his face.”Yours? Then let me have it now!”</p><p>Although he said ‘let’, his tone was strong and domineering. It was a direct command.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I won’t ‘let you win’.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Not allowed? Kid, it seems like you don’t know who I am? I’ll say it again, I’m going to cultivate my martial skill in the secret room now. If I’m delayed by you and my martial skill can’t break through, can you bear the responsibility?”</p><p>Bai Long said coldly.</p><p>if you need a secret chamber, open it yourself. Don’t grumble here. What does it have to do with me if you need to practice martial arts? get out of here, I still need to practice!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands as if he was chasing away flies.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
