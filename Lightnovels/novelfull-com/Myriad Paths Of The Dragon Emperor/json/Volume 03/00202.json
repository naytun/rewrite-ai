It was like a small world inside.</p><p>There were countless mountains, rivers, and historical sites.</p><p>In particular, the palaces and pavilions were densely packed and overlapping.</p><p>The dormitory of the general Star Hall was made up of many pavilions.</p><p>They were all seven-story pavilions with rooms.</p><p>Lu Ming’s room was on the third floor. There was a metal plate hanging at the door with the number 11232 written on it.</p><p>Ming Feng’s room was right next to his.</p><p>After taking out his identity Jade plate, Zhang tie shone it on the iron plate. As the iron plate glowed, the door opened automatically.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>The room was very spacious and elegantly decorated. There was even a bookshelf on one side of the room, which was filled with brand new books.</p><p>the treatment in the general stars Hall is much better than in the mystical sword sect. Although the royal family has declined, they are still the Orthodox lineage. Their heritage is still there.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Not long after, there was a knock on the door. When he opened the door, he saw that it was Mingzhu and Mingfeng.</p><p>brother Tian, you’ve just joined the general Star Hall. I’ll show you around!</p><p>Mingzhu smiled sweetly.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He wanted to familiarize himself with it.</p><p>Lu Ming and the Pearl mountain strolled around the general Star Hall.</p><p>They chatted as they walked.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming found out that Mingzhu and Ming Feng were the children of a general in the blazing sun Empire. Their father guarded the border and fought wars all year round. As his children, they naturally joined the general stars Hall and could become generals who guarded an area in the future.</p><p>The three of them chatted as they walked, and their relationship slowly grew closer.</p><p>After a few hours, Lu Ming returned to his room and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He moved his hand and a secret manual appeared in his hand.</p><p>The three Palms was one of the two earth level martial arts techniques that Lu Ming had obtained from the Dongyi tribe’s ruins.</p><p>Previously, he didn’t have that much energy to cultivate, but now that he had already cultivated the soaring steps to the highest level, he could finally start cultivating the three Palms.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the secret manual of the three Palms and read it in detail.</p><p>After a long time, Lu Ming closed the secret manual, his face full of surprise.</p><p>The three palm strikes were completely offensive martial arts techniques, and their power exceeded his imagination.</p><p>Three Palms. In fact, there were only three Palms in total.</p><p>The first palm strike was the palm of humanity.</p><p>The second palm was the beast DAO palm.</p><p>The third palm strike was the heavenly path palm strike.</p><p>According to the introduction, the power of the first palm, the human path palm, was already completely equivalent to the power of other earth grade martial arts techniques.</p><p>The power of the second palm had completely exceeded the power of a low Earth grade martial technique, and was infinitely close to a high earth grade martial technique.</p><p>As for the third palm, the heavenly path palm, it was said that when cultivated to the highest realm, its power was infinitely close to that of a heaven rank martial skill.</p><p>It was infinitely close to a heaven level martial arts technique. Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw this.</p><p>Heaven level martial skills, what kind of concept was that? it was much stronger than earth level martial skills, incomparably terrifying. That was a martial skill that only King level Warriors were qualified to cultivate.</p><p>The reason why the three Palms were classified as a low Earth grade martial arts technique, according to the introduction, was because the third palm, in history, very few people were able to successfully cultivate it, the difficulty was too great.</p><p>Having it was equivalent to not having it, so the three palm strikes were determined as earth grade lower level martial arts techniques.</p><p>Only when the first palm had been cultivated to the third level could the second palm be cultivated.</p><p>However, if he wanted to cultivate the third palm, he didn’t know what conditions he would need. It all depended on luck.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully comprehended it. After reading it, he took out the three palm secret manual and read it in detail.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the three Palms was even more difficult than the ancient shield technique.</p><p>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In three days, there was no progress in the three palm strikes.</p><p>At this moment, it was time for the new students to take their test.</p><p>Early in the morning, Mingzhu and Ming Feng found Lu Ming and walked to the martial arts school field with him.</p><p>The martial arts field was extremely vast. It was said to be the place where the Emperor reviewed his troops. One could not see the end of it.</p><p>On one side of the field, there were more than a dozen fighting rings.</p><p>At this moment, hundreds of people had already gathered around one of the fighting rings.</p><p>More than a hundred of them were the new students.</p><p>As for the others, they were all senior students. Some of them were here to watch the show, while others were here to take part in the test.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, he saw a few cold eyes staring at him.</p><p>They were Hua Jie, Chen Xiong, and the others.</p><p>Beside Hua Jie, there were more than ten young men. They had indeed come.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered with them.</p><p>this kid is so calm now. Wait a moment, let’s see how he dies!</p><p>“That’s right. He’s lucky to be alive today for daring to offend the young prince, but that’s it.”</p><p>The other young men beside Hua Jie sneered.</p><p>Hua Jie’s lips curled into a cold killing intent as he said,”Chen Xiong, wait a moment. You just need to be ruthless and put the blame on the star Hall. I’ll take the responsibility.”</p><p>“Young prince, don’t worry. I know what to do!”</p><p>Chen Xiong sneered.</p><p>After that, the number of people slowly increased, and in the end, there were about 500 people.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged elder stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>the test this time is very simple. I’ll send out the senior students to fight with the new students. The new students don’t have to be afraid and just use your strength to the fullest. If you can withstand 100 moves from the senior students, the general Star Hall will give you a generous reward. If you can defeat the senior students, you will be able to cultivate for one year free in the other six cultivation sanctuaries of the general Star Hall, except for the earth cave.</p><p>The middle-aged elder announced.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the eyes of many new students began to light up.</p><p>seven cultivation sanctuaries? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts. Obviously, he had not heard of it.</p><p>brother Tian, the seven cultivation sanctuaries are unique to the general Star Hall. It’s very magical. I’ll tell you in detail after the test.</p><p>Mingzhu said in a low voice.</p><p>alright, let’s begin. The first to come up is Wu Yuan.</p><p>The middle-aged elder announced.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a thin young man stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Du can, you go up and test him.”</p><p>The middle-aged elder instructed an older student.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A senior student in a red robe appeared.</p><p>Without saying much, the battle began.</p><p>The new student, Wu Yuan, launched a frenzied attack. The battle saber in his hand turned into a rolling Saber Light, attacking towards du can.</p><p>As for du can, he had a smile on his face the entire time. He was unruffled and did not fight back. Instead, he dodged blindly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell that du can’s cultivation was definitely above that of a martial Grandmaster while Wu Yuan was only a sixth grade master. The difference was too great.</p><p>If du can really made a move, he would be able to take Wu Yuan’s life in half a move.</p><p>However, du can did not make a move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He raised his head and looked at the sky to his right.</p><p>In the sky, above a cloud, a few elders were watching the fighting ring with bright eyes.</p><p>as expected, there are experts observing in the dark. It seems that this general stars Hall is not simple. It can’t be like the rumors outside that the general stars Hall is used by the royal family to cultivate their own strength in an attempt to fight against the ten direction Sword School, right? but it’s so obvious. It’s impossible that the ten direction Sword School doesn’t know about it, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, full of doubts.</p><p>At this moment, a few old men were carefully observing the competition on the fighting ring.</p><p>the blade light is rolling. This is the lone Peak thirty strikes. This Wu Yuan should be from the lone Peak City. There’s no problem.</p><p>An old man said.</p><p>“It’s a pity that his cultivation is too weak and his talent is average.”</p><p>Another old man sighed.</p><p>“There’s no other way. Most of the talented ones have been recruited by the five great sects. Let’s wait and see.”</p><p>Another sigh was heard.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
