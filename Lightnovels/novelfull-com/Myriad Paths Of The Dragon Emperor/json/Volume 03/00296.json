Which one of them didn’t have a few lives?</p><p>Therefore, when he sorted out the storage rings, there were more than 200 of them.</p><p>Most of the 200-odd storage rings belonged to eighth or ninth grade Grandmaster realm young geniuses, but there were also dozens of storage rings that belonged to martial grandmasters.</p><p>There were even storage rings from peerless geniuses like Qiu changlie and Zhao Hong.</p><p>Lu Ming was full of anticipation for the wealth inside.</p><p>He didn’t know and was shocked.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was mentally prepared, he was still dumbfounded.</p><p>A mountain of spiritual crystals could not even be stored in a storage ring.</p><p>There were 55.56 million spiritual crystals in total.</p><p>50 million? What a terrifying number this was? Lu Ming was in a daze.</p><p>Holding back his ecstasy, Lu Ming used a few storage rings to keep the spiritual crystals and looked at the other items.</p><p>There were over four thousand spirit weapons.</p><p>There were more than 12000 spiritual herbs and grasses.</p><p>However, most of them weren’t very high level, and only a few of them had reached Level 4.</p><p>There were also over 200 books of various cultivation techniques and martial arts techniques, as well as all kinds of forging materials.</p><p>He had struck it rich. Lu Ming had struck it rich.</p><p>this amount of wealth … Other than the five great sects and the royal family, I don’t think the other small forces in the blazing sun Empire would have this much even if they went bankrupt.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming put the various items into the storage ring and kept them.</p><p>Then, he kept it and the ten thousand spirit combat body manual appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He flipped it open and started to read it carefully.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming closed the secret manual.</p><p>“The ten thousand spiritual combat body is so terrifying and mysterious.”</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>The 10,000-mile battle body could refine all the spirits in the world and produce the Qi of 10000 spirits, which would be integrated into the body and constantly improve the strength of the body.</p><p>Ten thousand spirits, as long as it was something with spirituality in the world, it could be used.</p><p>For example, all kinds of spiritual herbs, metal materials, and ores that contained spiritual essence could be refined into the Qi of ten thousand spirits to cultivate the body.</p><p>It could even be used on living creatures. It was terrifying.</p><p>as expected of a technique that can cultivate one’s body to the ninth stage. It’s really overbearing.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and excited.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to comprehend.</p><p>For three consecutive days, Lu Ming had been trying to comprehend the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>……</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away from the imperial capital, there was a stretch of mountains that stretched on endlessly like a Fairyland. This was the location of the ten direction sword sect, the ten direction mountain.</p><p>At the highest point of the ten square Mountain, a dozen people were sitting in a Hall.</p><p>Each of them was just sitting there casually, but they exuded an aura as vast as the mountains and as deep as the sea, vast and unfathomable.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, the sect leader of the ten directions sword sect, sat at the highest position with a gloomy expression.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall was extremely oppressive.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, an old man with a cold face slammed the table and shouted, ” “That brat tianyun deserves to die for killing the peerless hero of my ten directions sword sect. Sect leader, please allow me to personally kill tianyun!”</p><p>“This is inappropriate!”</p><p>Another voice rang out. tianyun and changlie were having a life-and-death battle. Countless people in the imperial capital saw it. If we were to kill tianyun like this, I’m afraid it would incur the wrath of the martial world.</p><p>then we can send assassins!</p><p>The cold-faced old man said.</p><p>tianyun is a small matter. Our plan is more important. I don’t think we can let tianyun affect our plan.</p><p>The person from before said.</p><p>The crowd fell into silence again.</p><p>After a while, Qiu Wuyang said, ” let’s follow our plan first. As long as everything goes well, tianyun will be dead. He killed the hero of our Shifang sword sect. He can’t live in this world. But let’s put it aside for now.</p><p>“Now, let’s discuss the specific details of this matter!”</p><p>No one objected to Qiu Wuyang’s suggestion. Then, they began to discuss an important matter.</p><p>In the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming had been meditating on the ten thousand spiritual combat body for three days. Three days later, he opened his eyes.</p><p>Then, he moved his hand and a level 2 spiritual herb appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Following that, the essential Qi in his body trembled according to the ten thousand spirit combat body’s technique. A wave of dense Qi spread out from Lu Ming’s palm and wrapped around the spiritual herb.</p><p>After a few breaths, the spirit herb disappeared. It was refined into a wisp of strange gas and entered Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This was the Qi of ten thousand spirits.</p><p>Once the Qi of myriad spirits entered Lu Ming’s body, it seeped into his entire body. Lu Ming could clearly feel that his physical body was getting stronger. Although the extent was not large and it was very small, it was indeed getting stronger. It was many times faster than ordinary physical cultivation techniques.</p><p>“Amazing, this is amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and his eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>Then, he took out a level 3 spiritual herb and turned it into the Qi of ten thousand spirits to improve his body.</p><p>For the next three days, Lu Ming continued to refine spiritual herbs and improve his physical body.</p><p>In these three days, he refined no less than 200 spiritual herbs. Finally, his body broke through the limit and reached the fourth-grade body in one go.</p><p>The fourth-grade physical body was extremely wondrous.</p><p>Lu Ming could almost change his muscles, bones, and body shape at will.</p><p>Even after being injured, the muscles would automatically wriggle, sealing the wound and healing it quickly.</p><p>His muscles were like steel, and his bones were like steel. His veins were wide and flexible. Lu Ming could unleash his strength without any restraint. This was a huge improvement to his combat strength.</p><p>now that my physical body has reached the fourth stage, I can finally start cultivating the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to take out the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and begin to comprehend it.</p><p>The pressure from the secret manual was no longer a problem for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, after a moment, he closed the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and frowned.</p><p>Because he was completely confused, he didn’t know where to start.</p><p>It was too difficult to cultivate a divine level martial technique.</p><p>A God-level martial technique was completely different from the heaven, earth, black, and yellow level martial techniques.</p><p>God-level martial techniques were not divided into levels such as the first level, the second level, and so on.</p><p>God-level martial techniques were very special. Each one was unique in the world, and there were all kinds of differences.</p><p>For example, the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was divided into nine steps.</p><p>With every step he cultivated, the power would become stronger and stronger. Step by step, the power would stack.</p><p>If he could cultivate the nine steps, the power of the nine steps would stack up, and he could crush mountains and break the heavens. The power was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>As long as the first step of the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was cultivated, the full power of the first step could be exerted. At the same time, as one’s cultivation level increased, the power of the first step would also become stronger.</p><p>It was a pity that it was too difficult to cultivate it. Lu Ming studied it for a while but could not find any clues.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to comprehend it slowly. As long as I put in more effort, I don’t believe I can’t cultivate it successfully!</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and pondered.</p><p>After comprehending the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps for a while, he began to cultivate the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>He had countless spiritual herbs on him, so he didn’t have to worry about not having enough spiritual herbs to cultivate.</p><p>After cultivating the ten thousand spirit combat body for a few hours, Lu Ming condensed a figure on the third platform and fought with it to cultivate his martial arts technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
