He roared and staggered up, leaving the earth Yuan cave.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liu Mazi and the others were waiting there.</p><p>Three days later, in Ming Feng’s dormitory, Mingzhu and Ming Feng sat opposite each other.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mingzhu slammed the table heavily. Her face was dark as she said, ” “Baichi, you’ve gone too far!”</p><p>“Sister, I must take revenge for this!”</p><p>Ming Feng gritted his teeth.</p><p>After three days, his injuries were much better, but a few of his bones were broken, and it was not something that could be healed in a few days.</p><p>“Little brother, do you really want big brother to take action?”</p><p>Mingzhu asked.</p><p>“Not bad! Only big brother can take revenge for me!” Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Big brother has been focusing on his cultivation and has been keeping a low profile. That’s why he’s not listed in the top ten Warriors of the outer Palace. But you and I both know his combat strength. He should be able to deal with bai chi. But big brother is in closed door cultivation now. I’m afraid he has to wait for a while.”</p><p>Mingzhu pondered for a while and said.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, I’ll wait, wait for big brother to come out of seclusion, big brother will definitely make a decision for me.”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Mm, that’s good!”</p><p>Mingzhu nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea what was happening in the outside world. He was focused on cultivation.</p><p>Every day, other than cultivating the true war Dragon technique, he would be comprehending the force of fire.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained a lot in a month’s time.</p><p>Cultivating here for a month was equivalent to cultivating in the outside world for more than a year. In nearly two years, Lu Ming had condensed his essential Qi properly. Not only did he eliminate all the hidden dangers left behind by his rapid improvement in the past, but his cultivation also progressed steadily and steadily, step by step, he reached the peak of the fourth grade great master realm.</p><p>It could not be helped. Lu Ming needed too much energy to increase his cultivation level. Lu Ming’s main purpose was to lay a solid foundation. Hence, the progress was very slow.</p><p>However, his essential Qi was full and smooth as one. He had already reached the limit of the fourth grade great Martial Master and was only one step away from the fifth grade great Martial Master. Lu Ming was still very satisfied.</p><p>His force of fire had also made great progress. Although it was still far from the great completion, it had been moving forward steadily, taking a big step forward from the foundation of the small completion.</p><p>if you have time in the future, you should come here more often to cultivate. This is only the fifth level. The effects of the lower levels will definitely be greater!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, the stone door opened. It was time and Lu Ming walked out.</p><p>Then, he went up.</p><p>When he reached the third level, Lu Ming was slightly stunned because Liu Mazi and the rest were still there.</p><p>“It’s that kid. He’s out.”</p><p>The eyes of Liu Mazi and the rest lit up when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“You really haven’t changed!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and looked at the secret room at bright peak.</p><p>The stone door was dim, and it was obvious that no one was cultivating inside.</p><p>“Eh, he should’ve arrived at Ming Feng’s Secret room just a few minutes earlier than me. If he came out, he should’ve waited for me. Could it be that he came out early?”</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking in his heart.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly flashed. He saw some faint palm prints on the stone door of the secret chamber.</p><p>Although the palm print was very faint, it could not escape Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming remembered that there was definitely no such thing before.</p><p>“Did something happen to Ming Feng?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He suddenly turned around and looked at Liu Mazi and the rest.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>At this moment, Liu Mazi and the rest were about to slip away. Lu Ming shouted loudly. Everyone was so frightened that their faces turned pale and they could only stop.</p><p>“Let me ask you, where are the people in this secret chamber? The young man who came with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“This … We don’t know about that.”</p><p>Liu Mazi’s eyes flickered as he stuttered.</p><p>“There’s definitely something going on!”</p><p>The expressions of Liu Mazi and the rest made Lu Ming even more certain.</p><p>“Tell me, what happened? if you don’t tell me, you can’t leave.”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes, and a murderous aura burst out.</p><p>Liu Mazi and the others shivered and were scared to death. Finally, they told him everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. His violent essential Qi was wreaking havoc in the cave.</p><p>“Bailong, Baichi, damn you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice. His voice was extremely cold.</p><p>Speaking of which, Ming Feng was still implicated by him. This debt, he definitely had to get it back for Ming Feng.</p><p>“Big … Big brother, this has nothing to do with us. We are here because of Baichi.”</p><p>Liu Mazi said, trembling.</p><p>“Cut the crap. Lead the way to Baichi’s residence!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Liu Mazi and the rest were stunned. Then, they looked shocked. Lu Ming was going to find trouble with bai chi directly.</p><p>“Good, this kid is really arrogant. Bring him to bai chi and let bai chi teach him a lesson. It will also help me vent my anger.”</p><p>Liu Mazi thought to himself and then quickly nodded in agreement.</p><p>Then, Liu Mazi and the rest brought Lu Ming to bai Chi’s residence.</p><p>More than ten minutes before Lu Ming ended his cultivation, a tall young man with a saber on his back walked into Ming Feng’s dormitory.</p><p>“Hahaha, little brother, you’ve finally joined the general Star Hall. Big brother has been busy cultivating and didn’t come to see you. Don’t blame big brother.”</p><p>The young man burst into laughter as soon as he entered Ming Feng’s room.</p><p>Mingzhu was beside the young man.</p><p>“Big brother, you’ve come out of seclusion?”</p><p>When Ming Feng saw the young man, he shouted in joy.</p><p>“En, I’ve come out of seclusion. Long time no see, let me see if your cultivation has improved.”</p><p>The young man had a smile on his face as he sized up Ming Feng.</p><p>With one look, his expression changed slightly, and he said, ” “Little brother, you were injured some time ago?”</p><p>As the saying goes, it takes a hundred days to recover from a serious injury. A month ago, Ming Feng had many of his bones broken. Even if his cultivation was not weak, a month’s time was not enough for him to recover to his peak.</p><p>Naturally, the young man could tell at a glance.</p><p>“Big brother, you have to help me.”</p><p>Ming Feng immediately shouted.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The young man frowned.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Ming Feng then explained everything.</p><p>“Bai chi, you’re good. You’re only ranked tenth among the top ten experts of the outer Palace, yet you’re so arrogant. It seems that it’s wrong for my Ming city to blindly cultivate during this period of time. It’s time for me to move my bones and let people know how powerful I am.”</p><p>Ming Cheng’s face darkened and he said coldly.</p><p>let’s go. Take me to Baichi’s residence. I’ll take revenge for this.</p><p>Ming Cheng waved his hand.</p><p>“Big brother, I know Baichi’s residence!”</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>The three siblings of the Ming family headed toward bai Chi’s residence.</p><p>As one of the top ten Masters of the outer Palace, bai Chi’s residence was completely different from the other students.</p><p>He had his own courtyard, which was right behind the pavilions where the other students lived.</p><p>Soon, Ming Cheng, Ming Feng, and Ming Zhu arrived at bai Chi’s residence.</p><p>“Baichi, get out here!”</p><p>Ming Cheng roared. His voice rolled like the tide and spread far and wide, spreading throughout the entire dormitory area.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
