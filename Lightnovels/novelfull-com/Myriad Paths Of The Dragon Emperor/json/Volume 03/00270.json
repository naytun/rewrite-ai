His body swayed and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>But Xie nianqing’s body was shaking, his eyes were unfocused, and he shouted, ” “Lu Ming, I’m going to stomp on you!”</p><p>After saying that, his body went soft and he actually fell down directly, falling into a coma.</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he wanted to laugh. This woman was still thinking about this at this time.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The corrosive mist in the surroundings caused his skin to burn and sting.</p><p>Furthermore, this mist would seep into one’s skin, causing one to fall into a state of drowsiness.</p><p>“Could it be that I’m really going to die Here this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself, but he felt extremely indignant in his heart.</p><p>However, his body was indeed getting weaker and weaker, and his spirit was also getting more and more deficient.</p><p>“Argh! I want to hold on, I want to get out of here alive, I want to step onto the peak of martial arts!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and tried his best to resist.</p><p>Giving in was not in his character.</p><p>However, this mist was too strange and too powerful. It was not something that could be done by not submitting to it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to fall unconscious, the world suddenly turned upside down. Lu Ming found himself in another place.</p><p>“Supreme shrine, this is the Supreme shrine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised and puzzled.</p><p>Wasn’t the Supreme shrine a place that he couldn’t enter when he was in danger?</p><p>He had tried many times in the past, but it was useless. He didn’t expect it to come in automatically.</p><p>However, Lu Ming looked up and was a little surprised.</p><p>He realized that he was not on the first three platforms, but on the platform at the highest point. Below him was a long flight of stairs that led to the bottom.</p><p>On the other side was a Palace, which was exactly the same as the one he had seen on the first three platforms.</p><p>Xie nianqing was lying next to him, still unconscious.</p><p>“How did I appear at the highest point?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. He looked into the palace.</p><p>The palace’s door was open, and it was dark inside. A figure could be vaguely seen sitting cross-legged inside.</p><p>Suddenly, the figure moved. He actually stood up and walked out.</p><p>Ta ta ta.</p><p>With the sound of footsteps, Lu Ming’s heart started to beat rapidly.</p><p>It had been more than two years since he had obtained the Supreme shrine. Lu Ming was extremely curious about the palace and the people inside.</p><p>He had always wanted to see what it was, but he couldn’t get there, so he had to give up.</p><p>Now, could he finally get his wish?</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>Light footsteps could be heard and a figure walked out.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man wearing a red battle robe with a sun embroidered on it.</p><p>He was tall and muscular, with a tough and stocky build. When he opened his eyes, it was as if two suns were emerging.</p><p>The aura he gave off was as deep as the vast universe. Just by standing there, he seemed to be able to swallow the world and look down on everything.</p><p>Facing him, Lu Ming seemed to be facing the entire world.</p><p>However, in the next moment, the middle-aged man’s aura disappeared. He looked like a mortal. He looked at Lu Ming with a complicated expression.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned for a moment before he stepped forward and cupped his fists in greeting.”Junior Lu Ming pays his respects to senior.”</p><p>“You don’t need to introduce me. I’ve been following you for years.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s voice was filled with dominance.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>“Senior, thank you for saving me this time!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t be happy. I didn’t want to save you at first. I just didn’t want to waste a drop of the nine Dragons ‘blood essence.</p><p>The middle-aged man said with a casual smile.</p><p>Then, he sized Lu Ming up carefully and said, ” “Are you very curious about who I am? What is this place?”</p><p>“That’s right, please tell me, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He was indeed extremely curious. The main reason he had his current achievements was because of the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“Alright, I can tell you.”</p><p>The middle-aged man said. Then, he placed his hands behind his back and walked back and forth a few steps, as if he was in deep thought.</p><p>“I am the nine suns Paragon!” The middle-aged man said after a long while.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body and mind trembled. His pupils widened and he had an incredulous look on his face.</p><p>“You’re the Supreme nine yang of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Is there a second Supreme Master of the nine suns in the world?”</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>There was no other reason. The nine suns cosmos supremacy’s background was simply too great. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to describe him as world-famous.</p><p>Lu Ming had long heard of the reputation of the nine suns cosmos supremacy. However, to him, the nine suns supremacy was just a legendary figure.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme was from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He was the first disciple of Martial Emperor Di Yi of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. His cultivation base was earth-shattering and unparalleled.</p><p>He was known as the nine suns Supreme, and his cultivation was infinitely close to the martial Royal realm. He was the invincible God of War of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Such a person could annihilate the 36 empires of Emperor Yun with a snap of his fingers. How could he be here? Hiding in such a Palace?</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s doubts, nine suns Supreme sighed and said,”What you’re seeing now is not my true body. I’m actually already dead. This is just a wisp of my soul,”</p><p>“What? You’re already dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming found it hard to believe.</p><p>With the cultivation and combat strength of the nine suns Supreme, who could kill him?</p><p>Even a Martial Emperor might not be able to kill him.</p><p>that’s right. I’m dead. The one who killed me was my master, the ruler of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme had been killed by his master, Martial Emperor Di Yi. How could this be possible?</p><p>“You must be very surprised, right?”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang sneered.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s quite unexpected.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything.</p><p>hahaha, what’s there to be surprised about? Di Yi, that old man, is just a treacherous villain. He can do anything.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master laughed in anger. His voice was filled with hatred and killing intent.</p><p>boy, do you want to know why di Yi, that old man, would kill me? and why you awakened the bloodline of Nine Dragons? ”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“The bloodline of the nine Dragons? Could it be that my bloodline is called the bloodline of the nine Dragons? But, what are the nine Dragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of doubts. Of course, he nodded repeatedly.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll tell you the whole story.”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said. Then, he began to explain the entire story in detail.</p><p>The nine Dragons were extremely ancient and powerful beings in the world. Legend had it that they were one of the true dragons, but they were different from the true dragons as they were a variation of the true dragons.</p><p>True dragons had five claws and were called five-clawed true dragons.</p><p>The nine Dragons, on the other hand, had nine claws. They were extremely terrifying and invincible. Ordinary true dragons were far inferior to them.</p><p>It was said that since ancient times, there had only been one dragon in the world.</p><p>And the divine wilderness continent had an immemorial barren land. It was said to be the ruins of the nine Dragons, and it was extremely dangerous.</p><p>With his powerful strength and terrifying bloodline, the Supreme Master of nine suns had broken through the nine Dragon ruins once and obtained some things.</p><p>Among them were two drops of nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
