Bang!</p><p>One by one, the disciples of the ten directions sword sect were sent flying. By the time yang Zaitian arrived, there were only a few left standing.</p><p>Yang Zaitian looked around gloomily. Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said coldly,”I told you to stop, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>“I heard you, but Who Do You Think You Are? Do I have to stop just because you tell me to?”</p><p>Lu Ming gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p>Yang Zaitian was stunned, and his face became gloomier.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that he was a nobody?</p><p>Yang Zaitian was so angry that he laughed and said, ” tianyun, I’ve said before that you are my prey. At that time, I was just saying it casually. But now, you’re dead. There’s no way you can live!</p><p>does the Shifang Sword School have the same strategy? you say that I’m dead the moment you see me, but you all end up lying here. You’ll be the same soon.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to these trash.”</p><p>Yang Zaitian said.</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions Sword School had unsightly expressions on their faces. Yang Zaitian had called them trash in public, so of course, they felt uncomfortable.</p><p>in my eyes, you’re the same as them. You’re all trash!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Audacious! Impudent!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian shouted angrily, his killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>He, yang Zaitian, had been a genius since he was born. Along the way, he had defeated his peers and was almost invincible.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually said that he was trash. This was a great humiliation.</p><p>He had to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve succeeded! You’ve successfully angered me! Today, I’ll break all the bones in your body and feed you to the blood ants!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared, and his aura burst out.</p><p>Furthermore, it was constantly improving.</p><p>Soon, he broke through the limit of the peak sixth grade great master realm and entered the seventh grade great master realm.</p><p>“Seventh grade great master realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>“Seventh grade great Martial Master! Senior brother yang Zaitian has broken through to the seventh grade great Martial Master realm! Tianyun is dead for sure!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect shouted in ecstasy.</p><p>Yang Zaitian had always been a peerless genius, and he had suppressed his peers. With such a breakthrough in cultivation, his combat strength would also soar.</p><p>“Senior brother yang Zaitian, don’t kill tianyun so easily. I want to torture him.”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>“Tianyun, I saw it just now. To think that you’ve actually comprehended two types of Shi. That’s truly astonishing. However, let me tell you this. Shi, in terms of quality, not quantity. Furthermore, no matter how much Shi there is, in the face of absolute power, it will still fall apart.”</p><p>Yang Zaitian’s eyes were like lightning, and his momentum was like a tiger. He took a step forward, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>you talk too much nonsense. You’re just finding excuses for your own incompetence!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“I’m useless? Hahaha, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared and unsheathed his combat sword. A hot aura burst out.</p><p>Force, it was actually the force of fire.</p><p>“I’ll let you see the true power of fire!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian let out a long howl and rushed toward Lu Ming, swinging his sword.</p><p>The power of the fire wrapped around the sword Qi and exploded with a shocking power.</p><p>“So it’s the initial success of the force of fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>your Shi is only at the tip of the iceberg, while my Shi is already at the small success stage. This is what essence is!</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared with contempt.</p><p>Earlier, Lu Ming’s force had not been released at full force. He thought that although Lu Ming had comprehended two types of force, it was only a superficial understanding. How could Lu Ming be a match for him?</p><p>“Frog in the well!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yang Zaitian was stunned, but the next moment, his face changed dramatically.</p><p>This was because the force on Lu Ming’s body was rising uncontrollably.</p><p>First of all, his Fire Force had reached the small success in an instant, and it was still rising. Although it did not reach the great success in the end, it was still stronger than yang Zaitian’s force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A spear light shot out and collided with yang Zaitian’s sword Qi. The two of them dissipated.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can your Fire Force be so strong? What’s going on?”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared in disbelief.</p><p>Just now, he was still looking down on Lu Ming, saying that Lu Ming had too much power but was not good at it.</p><p>However, he immediately realized that Lu Ming not only had more, but he was also more astute than him.</p><p>It was like he was slapping himself hard in the face.</p><p>“This is impossible? Then let’s continue!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura rose again.</p><p>This time, it was wind force.</p><p>It went all the way up, like a hurricane sweeping through the sky. Finally, Lu Ming’s wind force had also rushed to the small success stage.</p><p>“Wind force small success, impossible, this is absolutely impossible, you’re cheating, you’re cheating, how could you comprehend two types of force to small success?”</p><p>Yang Zaitian was no longer calm, and he screamed hysterically.</p><p>In fact, even his facial features were distorted.</p><p>He had comprehended ‘force’ at the ninth grade master realm, which was rare even in the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>It was even rarer for a sixth grade great Martial Master to cultivate the force of fire to the small success stage.</p><p>He had always been extremely proud and regarded the six heroes of the scorching sun as his goal. He did not put anyone in his eyes.</p><p>But now, he suddenly realized that Lu Ming’s talent was stronger than his by a large margin. This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>“Die, die! This tianyun must die! In this world, there can not be a genius who can surpass me!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared in his heart.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, he activated his Blood Meridian and charged at Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The sword Qi was shocking and extremely hot.</p><p>Yang Zaitian was definitely a peerless genius with extremely terrifying combat strength. At this time, his full-strength attack was shocking.</p><p>Even an eighth grade great Martial Master would be killed in one move, and a ninth grade great Martial Master would have to retreat.</p><p>However, he had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of wind and Fire combined and turned into a blazing flame spear light that shot into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and yang Zaitian collided, turning into a terrifying and scorching shock wave that swept in all directions.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School all roared and retreated madly, not caring about their injuries.</p><p>The people from the general Star Hall in the distance also revealed expressions of shock and retreated frantically.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge shock waves hit the ground, creating deep pits.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With two loud roars, the two figures collided again.</p><p>From a distance, the two parties watched in shock. They saw two figures emitting a scorching aura colliding in the air and on the ground like two ancient giant beasts.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After more than a dozen collisions, more than a dozen large pits appeared on the ground. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>It was a good thing that they had been some distance away from the blood ant nest during their previous battle. Otherwise, the blood ant nest would have been destroyed.</p><p>Even so, the blood ant nest was still disturbed, and blood ants crawled out one by one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was another violent explosion, and a figure retreated quickly, being struck and sent flying.</p><p>It was yang Zaitian. At this time, he was in a very sorry state, covered in blood and his hair disheveled.</p><p>He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun, I want you dead! I want to kill you! I want to kill all your friends and family!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared, pretending to be crazy.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
