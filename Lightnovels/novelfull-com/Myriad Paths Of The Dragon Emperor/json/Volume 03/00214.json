Although the royal family has declined, we are still Orthodox. If the ten directions Sword School annihilates the royal family, the other four great sects will join forces and attack us. It’s sad to say that the ten directions Sword School is not afraid of the royal family, but the other four great sects.</p><p>Hua Chi sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. So that was the case.</p><p>however, the ten directions Sword School has the ambition of a Wolf. They’ve been supporting their own people in the royal family, trying to slowly erode the resistance of the royal family. In the end, they’ll achieve their goal of completely controlling the royal family. By then, everything in the royal family will really belong to the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>“Now, the royal family is divided into two factions. One faction is determined to resist, but the other faction wants to rely on the ten direction Sword School. This is especially true for the Heavenly King suppression.”</p><p>Hua Chi said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming listened quietly. He did not expect that there were so many secrets in between.</p><p>Hua Chi clearly trusted him, which was why he had told him so many secrets.</p><p>“I originally wanted to join the mystical sword sect and see if I could borrow their strength to fight against the ten direction sword sect. Now, it seems that this method is not feasible at all. I might as well stay in the Imperial City and accumulate my own strength!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a request. I hope you can agree to it!”</p><p>Hua Chi suddenly bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a surge of energy gushed out, lifting the pool.</p><p>“You’re my friend. If you have something to say, just say it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope that you can help me. Help me destroy the omnipresent Sword School!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes flickered with astonishing killing intent.</p><p>“Help you destroy the ten direction Sword School?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know that you’re extremely talented and that you’re a Dragon among men. I’m sure you won’t be trapped in a small place like the burning sun Empire in the future. You have a bigger stage to go on. I won’t ask you to join the royal family. I only hope that you can give me a hand when you’re strong in the future!”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment.</p><p>First of all, Hua Chi was his friend.</p><p>Moreover, his father, Lu Yuntian, was most likely in the hands of the ten direction sword sect. If that was true, he and the ten direction sword sect would become mortal enemies. They would have to face each other sooner or later, so there was no harm in agreeing to Hua Chi’s request.</p><p>“Good, that’s great!”</p><p>Hua Chi was ecstatic.</p><p>He was well aware of Lu Ming’s talent. As long as Lu Ming grew stronger, it was possible for him to become a martial King in the future. With Lu Ming’s help, great things were in sight. Naturally, he was excited.</p><p>Hua Chi moved his hand and a gold medal appeared in his hand. He passed it to Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, you’re now a member of the star cluster Hall. With this token, you can enter and leave the seven cultivation sanctuaries of the star cluster Hall as you wish without paying any fees!”</p><p>I can enter and leave the seven cultivation sanctuaries as I please? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he took the Golden token without any hesitation.</p><p>“Also, what is Star cluster Hall?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Hua Chi had a smile on his face, and he was clearly much happier.”Lu Ming, the general stars Hall recruits just about anyone. Their requirements are so low. Of course, they won’t do it for no reason.”</p><p>when a person enters the general Star Hall, the imperial family will send people to observe him and determine if he is from the five great sects and if he can be used by the imperial family. After a series of observations, we will confirm that this person can be used by the imperial family and has great talent. Then, we will recruit him into the Star cluster Hall.</p><p>the star cluster Hall is the core of the general stars Hall, and it will also be fully nurtured by the royal family. Many of the great generals guarding the border now came from the star cluster Hall, and they are also the trump card of the royal family against the ten direction Sword School!</p><p>At this point, Hua Chi pursed his lips and continued,”Of course, the general Star Hall also has a core, and that is the Dark Star Hall.”</p><p>“What? The Dark Star Hall belongs to the royal family?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Dark Star Hall was as famous as the shadow Wolf Pavilion, and was also one of the four major assassin organizations of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that the Dark Star Hall actually belonged to the royal family.</p><p>“Lu Ming, very few people know about this. You must not tell anyone. Otherwise, the omnipresent sword sect might make a big move.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Naturally, I won’t say anything!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>in fact, two of the four major assassin organizations in the blazing sun Empire were trained by the ten direction sword sect. They are the blood rain tower and the shadow Wolf Pavilion. The most mysterious underworld King mansion is also trained by the ten direction sword sect. I don’t even know who is behind them!</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“What? The shadow Wolf Pavilion belongs to the ten direction Sword School?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Duanmu family had sent assassins from the shadow Wolf Pavilion to kill him. He had thought that the shadow Wolf Pavilion was the support of the mystical sword sect!</p><p>He didn’t expect it to be the Shifang Sword school’s support.</p><p>How could the Duanmu family move someone who belonged to the ten direction Sword School?</p><p>Perhaps the shadow Wolf Pavilion would do anything as long as they were paid, or perhaps the Duanmu family had an unclear relationship with the shadow Wolf Pavilion, or perhaps the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have you discovered anything?”</p><p>Hua Chi asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and did not share his guess.</p><p>“Hua Chi, I also have a matter that I need your help with.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he suddenly said.</p><p>“What is it? As long as I can help, I will do my best to help.” Hua Chi said.</p><p>I need you to help me investigate a person. This person is my father.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and explained that Lu Yuntian might be in the imperial capital and in the hands of the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>“I can’t believe there’s such a hidden story. Don’t worry, Lu Ming. I’ll use all my power to help you investigate. As long as Uncle Lu is still in the Imperial City, I’ll help you find him even if I have to turn the Imperial City upside down.”</p><p>Hua Chi said firmly.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>With Hua Chi’s help, Lu Ming heaved a huge sigh of relief. He finally felt more at ease.</p><p>Hua Chi was the imperial family’s eighth prince, and he definitely had quite a bit of power in the imperial capital. With his help, it would be a thousand times better than him investigating like a headless fly.</p><p>Then, the two of them drank and chatted.</p><p>Very quickly, after three rounds of drinks, Lu Ming bade Hua Chi farewell.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s something I almost forgot to tell you. In two months, the royal family and the omnipresent sword sect will open a plane together to harvest the treasures and resources inside. In there, you can find treasures that are of great help to the awakening of a second bloodline!”</p><p>Hua Chi suddenly said.</p><p>“A treasure that can help you awaken your second bloodline? Of course, we’re going!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The awakening of the second bloodline was of utmost importance. Any treasure that could help with the awakening of the second bloodline could not be missed.</p><p>“Okay, actually, you’ve defeated Baichi, so you’ll definitely have a spot!”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming took his leave and returned to tianyun’s appearance before returning to the general stars Hall.</p><p>“I hope I can get news of father as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the bed, deep in thought.</p><p>He had a vague feeling that although the blazing sun Empire seemed to be calm right now, there were undercurrents surging in the dark. There were disputes between various parties, and he did not know when they would erupt. He had to find Lu Yuntian as soon as possible.</p><p>He also had to increase his strength.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
