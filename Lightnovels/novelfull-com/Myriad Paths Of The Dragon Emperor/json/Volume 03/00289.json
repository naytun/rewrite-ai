The Golden-eyed blood corpse’s body was not as strong as swords or Spears and was impervious to fire or water. It didn’t even feel yang Liuji’s hot fist energy when it landed on its body.</p><p>On the other hand, yang Liuji had to avoid the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s claw radiance. If he was not careful, he could be torn apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a dozen more moves, the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s claw landed on yang Liuji’s body. Yang Liuji dodged in shock, but he was still left with several wounds and blood.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and pounced towards yang Liuji.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>“Damn it, kid. One day, I’ll make sure you die without a burial ground.”</p><p>Yang Liuji let out a long, furious roar, then ran down the mountain.</p><p>“Take care, I won’t send you off!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said with a smile.</p><p>This almost made yang Liuji fall to the ground. He was so angry that his body trembled and he almost spat out blood.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, yang Liuji disappeared.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, more than a thousand people were waiting quietly.</p><p>Who would come down first?</p><p>Everyone was thinking about the same question.</p><p>“Perhaps that kid will never be able to come down!”</p><p>Some people sneered and felt that Lu Ming would most likely die at the hands of yang Liuji.</p><p>“Detestable guy, you can’t die in the hands of yang Liuji!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered.</p><p>Although she knew that Lu Ming had the Golden-eyed blood corpse with him, she was not confident. At this time, she could not help but reveal a worried look in her eyes. Even she did not notice it.</p><p>“Someone’s coming down!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise rang out. Many people were shocked and couldn’t help but look at the eighth path.</p><p>There was no one on the eighth route.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled as they looked at the first path.</p><p>Yang Liuji, covered in blood, came down from the first path with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The crowd burst into an uproar. More than a thousand people were dumbfounded.</p><p>The first to come down was yang Liuji, and he was injured.</p><p>Did he lose or win?</p><p>Everyone was guessing that perhaps yang Liuji had already killed Lu Ming and obtained the final reward.</p><p>However, yang Liuji’s next performance made everyone know that he had most likely lost.</p><p>He stood at the foot of the mountain and looked up at the peak with a cold expression.</p><p>This expression was obviously a defeat.</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. Even yang Liuji had been defeated. Who was this person?</p><p>On the mountain path, Lu Ming did not know about this. After watching yang Liuji leave, Lu Ming turned and walked up.</p><p>Up ahead, the road had already come to an end. At the end of the road, there was a bright ball of light.</p><p>A secret manual was floating in the ball of light.</p><p>“Another secret manual?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had already obtained an upper earth grade cultivation technique, and now a secret manual had appeared. Could it be a heaven grade secret manual?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to burn.</p><p>Stretching out his hand, he drew in his zhenqi and the manual fell into his palm.</p><p>The surface of the secret manual was covered with wisps of blood, which was extremely strange.</p><p>He opened the manual and took a look.</p><p>The ten thousand spiritual combat body was a body refining technique that could allow one to cultivate a ninth-grade body at most!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled violently. Then, he was overjoyed.</p><p>It was actually a body refining cultivation method, and it could cultivate a ninth-grade body. This was simply a priceless treasure, even more precious than heaven level martial skills.</p><p>“Haha, I was just looking for a body refining technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Then, he started to read it impatiently.</p><p>However, he had only read a few pages when heaven and earth suddenly shook.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a beam of light enveloped Lu Ming. He felt the world spinning around him and then disappeared from the mountain path.</p><p>At the same time, pillars of light appeared at the foot of the mountain and enveloped everyone.</p><p>Not only the foot of the mountain, but the rest of the young men in the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace were also covered by the light pillar.</p><p>After being enveloped by the light pillar, the figure disappeared the next moment.</p><p>A moment later, outside the cloud Emperor Palace, in the vast mountains near the blood Realm and Devil’s Den, light pillars suddenly appeared. The light pillars dispersed, revealing the figure inside.</p><p>They were all the young men who had entered the Yun Emperor Palace.</p><p>“He’s out, he’s out. Let’s ask about the situation.”</p><p>“Let’s see if there are any treasures inside.”</p><p>In the vast mountains, the elders all called out.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his head spinning. When he reappeared, he found himself between two mountains.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse also came out and stood beside him.</p><p>In the sky, human figures were flying here and there.</p><p>“Little bastard, get out and face your death!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar reverberated through the vast mountains. It was yang Liuji. He stood high in the sky with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“What’s going on? Who does yang Liuji want to kill?”</p><p>Many of the older generation were puzzled.</p><p>After asking the other young men, he found out that yang Liuji had suffered a great loss in the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace.</p><p>The elders were shocked. They didn’t think that with yang Liuji’s cultivation, he would actually suffer a great loss at the hands of someone from the younger generation.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” damn it, he actually dared to take a treasure from the hands of the great sun sect’s genius. Damn it!</p><p>find that bastard and let him know the consequences of offending our great sun House!</p><p>&Nbsp; some of the older generation of the great sun Prefecture shouted, their auras like mountains.</p><p>“A bunch of idiots!”</p><p>In the forest, Lu Ming’s mouth twitched in disdain. Then, he and the Golden-eyed blood corpse ran in the direction of the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave.</p><p>He had made an agreement with Xie nianqing to rush to the blood zone and Devil’s Cave as soon as he came out.</p><p>He wanted to go back to the blazing sun Empire through the blood and Devil’s Den, because if he wanted to go around the blood and Devil’s Den, the journey would be more than ten times longer.</p><p>&Nbsp; those from the great sun Prefecture had never seen him before, so how could they find him? Lu Ming successfully crossed the mountain and arrived near the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave.</p><p>In front of him, a dark red mist filled the air, making everything hazy.</p><p>A graceful figure was standing there. Xie nianqing had arrived.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted. He led the Golden-eyed blood corpse and rushed in without hesitation.</p><p>Xie nianqing followed closely behind.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming and the rest appeared in the blood Realm.</p><p>He looked around, but he didn’t see the stone door from last time.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the demon suppressing token, which glowed. Not long after, a deafening roar was heard. The tall figure of the blood demon dashed out from the blood mist.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared. All the green hair on its body stood on end and it stood in front of Lu Ming. It looked at the blood demon that was running toward it with fear in its eyes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blood demon stopped not far away, causing a gust of wind as he looked at the Golden-eyed blood corpse with disdain.</p><p>“Alright, I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sent a thought to the Golden-eyed blood zombie to let it relax.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse finally relaxed.</p><p>“Let’s go up!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and jumped onto the back of the blood demon.</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing and the Golden-eyed blood corpse jumped onto the back of the blood demon. The blood demon roared and ran away.</p><p>This direction was the opposite of the blood Zhao Empire, so it should be the direction to the burning sun Empire.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
