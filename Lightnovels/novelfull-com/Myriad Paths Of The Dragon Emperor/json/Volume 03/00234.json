He focused on one blood ant and launched a storm of attacks at it.</p><p>Ming Cheng, who was running through the blood ant nest, heard deafening rumbles from behind and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“This brother tianyun is truly monstrous. I have to get out of here quickly. Otherwise, this blood ant nest will be destroyed.”</p><p>Ming Cheng Ran out desperately.</p><p>In the blood ant nest, Lu Ming’s courage mounted as he fought.</p><p>He didn’t have to worry about himself at all and attacked with all his might. One blood ant was already suppressed.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The demon subduing spear pierced through the blood ant’s body, blasting a huge hole in its extremely hard shell.</p><p>“What a hard shell!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>If he had not attacked with the power of wind and Fire, he would not have been able to break through the blood ants ‘defense.</p><p>It was impossible for ordinary martial artists below the ninth grade great Martial Master realm to break through the defense of the blood ants.</p><p>No wonder there were so many blood ant eggs in the blood ant nest all these years without being taken.</p><p>Those who had entered were all martial artists below the seventh grade great master realm. Who could be a match for these blood ants?</p><p>Even a genius like yang Zaitian, who had broken through to the seventh grade great Martial Master realm, was no match for a few blood ants. At most, he would only plunder a little and then escape.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear again. It pierced through the blood ant’s wound, all the way to the handle.</p><p>The blood ant screeched and struggled madly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and a powerful essential Qi burst forth, rushing into the blood ant’s body and crushing its internal organs.</p><p>He finally killed a blood ant.</p><p>Without any delay, Lu Ming charged at another one.</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the last mother ant fell to the ground, the three powerful blood ants were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming began to plunder wantonly. Rays of light enveloped the blood ant eggs in the cave and kept them into his storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming did not count and he did not know how many he had collected.</p><p>Two minutes later, all the blood ant eggs in the cave had been collected.</p><p>“Haha, I’m rich now!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but grin and laugh.</p><p>Then, he controlled his bloodline and devoured the blood essence of the three blood ants.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>This refining process took more than a day, and all three blood ants ‘blood essence had been refined.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had skyrocketed from the fifth grade great Martial Master to the early stage of the sixth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>the amount of energy required for cultivation has indeed increased.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled.</p><p>This was the blood essence of three ninth grade third level blood ants. It was four levels higher than Lu Ming’s. Furthermore, the blood essence of the blood ants was one or two times richer than that of ordinary demonic beasts.</p><p>Three ninth grade third level blood ants had only helped Lu Ming advance by one level. It was clear that the amount of energy Lu Ming needed was terrifying.</p><p>now that I’m a sixth grade Grandmaster, I’ll need at least twenty Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beasts ‘blood essence before I can advance.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Moreover, the level of his bloodline had not been upgraded yet. He did not know how much blood essence he would need to upgrade it to a seventh-level bloodline.</p><p>“We can’t let go of the corpses of these three blood ants. The shells on their bodies are rare refining materials.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the three blood ants ‘corpses into a storage ring.</p><p>it’s almost time for the mystic realm to close. Ming Cheng must be waiting anxiously outside. Let’s go out quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he ran outside.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming came out of the blood ant nest.</p><p>As soon as he came out, he saw Ming Cheng pacing around anxiously.</p><p>“Brother Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>tianyun, you’ve finally come out! I thought that you’d been defeated by a few ants!</p><p>Ming Cheng heaved a long sigh of relief and grinned when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“A few ants, how can they do anything to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, he waved his hand and a storage ring appeared.</p><p>brother Ming, there are some blood ant eggs in here. I got them from the blood ant nest. Take them!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, this is something you obtained with your own strength. How can I accept it? Furthermore, I’ve already gained a lot by following you into the blood ant nest.”</p><p>Ming Cheng waved his hands and refused firmly.</p><p>Lu Ming gave him more but Ming Cheng refused to accept it.</p><p>Seeing this, Lu Ming did not insist. He put away the storage ring and headed to the exit of the secret realm with Ming Cheng.</p><p>The exit of the secret realm was on the easternmost mountain peak of the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>Once the ten days were up, the elders of the imperial family and the general Star Hall would work together to open an exit for them to leave.</p><p>……</p><p>Outside the blood ant secret realm, a door of light appeared.</p><p>Many figures appeared around the door of light, and they were all looking at it.</p><p>There were people from the royal family and the ten direction Sword School, but there were many more people than ten days ago.</p><p>Moreover, some people were floating in the air. They were all martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>On the side of the imperial family, Hua Chi was among them.</p><p>At the very front were the red-haired elder and Qiu Wuzhi.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi looked at the members of the imperial family and sneered, ” “Eccentric red, why did you send so many people here? Are you going to get even with us when you see that the people from the general Star Hall have been killed? Have a great battle with us?”</p><p>I’m just taking precautions. I’m afraid that the disciples of your ten directions Sword School will suffer losses in the mystery Land and die inside. If that happens, you’ll fly into a rage out of humiliation and try to harm the students of my general stars Hall!</p><p>The red-haired old man replied with a cold smile.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi laughed and said,”a disciple of my ten directions Sword School is at a disadvantage?” Died in battle? With your general stars Hall? Impossible, this can’t be happening!”</p><p>“Things are unpredictable!” The red-haired old man said.</p><p>“That’s impossible. And I’m telling you clearly that killing is not forbidden in the blood ant secret realm. If my ten direction Sword School disciples really die in there, it’s because they’re weak. What a joke!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi said calmly.</p><p>“Remember what you said!”</p><p>The red-haired old man snorted.</p><p>“Eccentric red, you’re so confident. Don’t tell me that you think that tianyun or whatever can pose a threat to the disciples of my ten direction sword sect? I’m telling you, that’s impossible. Right now, that tianyun has already died at the hands of the heroes of my ten direction sword sect. ”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi sneered.</p><p>“Died at the hands of your ten direction Sword school’s disciple? I don’t think so!” The red-haired old man said.</p><p>“Not necessarily? Alright, how about we make a bet? I have a piece of Heavenly Star Mithril here. I heard that you have a Cloud Net fruit. How about I use the Heavenly Star Mithril to bet on the cloud Net fruit with you?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi said.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“What? Heavenly Star Mithril, Cloud Net fruit? Such a big bet?”</p><p>A martial Grandmaster expert exclaimed.</p><p>Star Mithril was an extremely precious material for refining weapons. It was a top fourth-level material that could be used to refine fourth-level spiritual weapons.</p><p>The cloud Net fruit was also a level 4 spiritual medicine, which could be used to refine Level 4 elixir pills.</p><p>The fourth-grade materials and spiritual herbs were all items of the martial arts Grandmaster level and were extremely precious.</p><p>As for the star Mithril and cloud Net fruit, they were considered top tier items among the Level 4 items.</p><p>Its value was no less than 100000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
