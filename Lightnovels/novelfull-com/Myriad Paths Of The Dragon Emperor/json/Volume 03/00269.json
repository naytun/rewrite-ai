This Blood Realm and Devil’s Den was too strange.</p><p>The two of them focused their attention on their surroundings.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Behind him, another pale arm covered in green hair reached out to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his long spear and it hit the claw. With a bang, Lu Ming saw a figure being sent flying.</p><p>All around, the roars continued. Some were filled with fierceness, while some were like screams of pain.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The blood mist churned and a tall figure pounced toward Lu Ming. Before it even reached him, the stench of blood filled the air.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming could finally see the monster clearly.</p><p>It was in the form of a human and was unusually tall. It was two heads taller than Lu Ming and had long green fur all over its body. Its eyes were blood-red and it had sharp teeth.</p><p>“Could this be a blood corpse?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was somewhat shocked.</p><p>The so-called blood corpse was a transformation of a martial artist after they died in battle. It was a type of zombie, but its body was impervious to swords and Spears and was extremely strong.</p><p>Without much time to think, the long spear pierced forward like a rainbow.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the blood corpse’s body, but Lu Ming did not look happy.</p><p>This was because he felt that the blood corpse’s body was like an Iron Man. Although he had pierced through the blood corpse’s body, it had taken him a lot of effort.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and the blood corpse was sent flying.</p><p>However, the roars continued and blood zombies continued to charge at the two.</p><p>Some of the blood zombies actually started killing each other.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The two of them rushed to the back, but the situation was still the same. There were blood zombies constantly rushing over, fearlessly roaring and full of killing intent, constantly pouncing at the two of them.</p><p>These blood zombies were very strong. The weakest of them was at the seventh or eighth grade of the great Martial Master realm, while the stronger ones were at the peak of the ninth grade great Martial Master realm. They were even close to the battle power of a martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The key was that there were too many of them, and they were very difficult to kill. The two of them immediately fell into a passive position.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body was filled with black true Qi. Black Lotus flowers danced around him. He waved his palms and black palm prints flew out, knocking away the blood zombies one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear danced like a fire Dragon and swept out, sending five to six blood zombies flying.</p><p>However, more blood zombies pounced over.</p><p>The two of them fought as they charged.</p><p>However, the blood zombies seemed to be endless as they swarmed in from all directions.</p><p>The battle continued like this, and in the blink of an eye, more than an hour had passed.</p><p>The two of them had lost a lot of true Qi, and they were already drenched in sweat.</p><p>“This can’t go on, I’ll definitely die from exhaustion!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Eh? The fog has thinned.”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He found that the blood-colored mist around him had become lighter, and his visibility was slowly increasing.</p><p>He could vaguely see that there were blood zombies all around him. Most of the blood zombies were actually killing each other and biting each other.</p><p>“If the mist becomes lighter, perhaps the blood zombies will retreat.”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>This was because when they first entered, the blood mist wasn’t thick, and there were no blood zombies. Only when the blood mist became thicker did the blood zombies appear.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the appearance of the blood corpse was related to the blood mist.</p><p>As time passed, the fog slowly faded.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing seemed to see hope.</p><p>But in the next moment-</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An earth-shaking roar was heard, shaking the earth and the sky. In the distance, an unimaginably dense blood Qi permeated the air.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and his heart started to beat rapidly.</p><p>That was not blood Qi, it was clearly a huge monster.</p><p>The huge creature was at least a hundred meters tall. It was like a mountain as it ran wildly on the ground.</p><p>It looked like a giant male lion, but the difference was that its body seemed to be made of blood, and it emitted a strong bloody smell.</p><p>It opened its mouth and howled, its voice shaking the heavens. An aura as deep as the ocean spread out.</p><p>Then, it opened its mouth and sucked in the blood zombies one by one, disappearing.</p><p>blood demon! Could this be the legendary blood demon? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice trembled.</p><p>It was not only her voice. Lu Ming could feel that even her body was trembling.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing’s hand and ran back in big steps. This blood demon was too powerful. Its aura was as deep as the ocean, and it was unfathomable.</p><p>It was impossible for them to fight him.</p><p>The two of them ran wildly. The blood zombies at the side seemed to be extremely shocked. They gave up on attacking Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and ran for their lives.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook as the blood demon’s huge body rushed toward Lu Ming and Lin fan.</p><p>“It can’t be!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt bitter in his heart. He used all his strength to run but his speed was still much slower than the blood demon.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the blood demon approached the two of them, its blood-red eyes staring at them.</p><p>“Are we going to die Here today?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think.</p><p>no, I can’t die. I just saved my father and haven’t avenged him yet. I can’t die.</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. His eyes were filled with determination and he was highly focused.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and struck out with his palm.</p><p>This palm made Lu Ming’s state reach its peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge palm print was formed. It was almost solid, and it was twice as big as the previous ones.</p><p>At the moment of life and death, Lu Ming’s human path palm had a breakthrough and reached the third level.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had cultivated for a few months in the earth cave and the divine Wind Valley before he broke through to the second level. Now that he was on the verge of death, he actually broke through again.</p><p>The third level of the human path palm was unprecedentedly powerful. It struck the blood demon with an earth-shattering force.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon roared with disdain in his eyes. He opened his mouth and spat out a blood light, striking the human Dao palm.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Like a popped bubble, the third level of the human path palm was destroyed.</p><p>The difference in strength was too great. It was not something that a single martial technique could make up for.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon roared and pounced on the two of them. It opened its mouth wide and a terrifying suction force was produced. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were sucked into the blood demon’s mouth without any resistance and disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood devil let out a satisfied roar and continued to attack the blood zombies.</p><p>“Grab it!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the blood demon’s mouth, Lu Ming grabbed Xie nianqing’s little hand. The two of them followed the strong suction force and fell down.</p><p>“Don’t let me go!”</p><p>At that moment, Xie nianqing’s face was pale. His eyes were filled with fear as he grabbed Lu Ming’s hands tightly.</p><p>At this moment, she was just like an ordinary little girl, so fragile that she needed to be protected.</p><p>“Hold on. Don’t give up until the last moment.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Essential Qi gushed out as he tried to escape from the gravitational force. However, it was useless. The gravitational force was too strong.</p><p>&Nbsp; after a few breaths, the two of them landed on a soft area, surrounded by a thick blood-colored mist.</p><p>This blood-colored mist had a terrifying corrosive power. As soon as the two of them landed, they felt a burning pain on their skin.</p><p>The two of them immediately circulated their true Qi to protect their bodies, but it was of little use. Their true Qi was being consumed rapidly.</p><p>The two of them did not have much genuine Qi left after the battle. It did not take long for them to use up all their genuine Qi.</p><p>The blood-red martial mist began to corrode their bodies.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
