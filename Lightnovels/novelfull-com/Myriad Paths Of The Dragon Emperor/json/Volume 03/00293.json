Terrifying waves swept in all directions.</p><p>From the ground, one could see that a visible wave of air exploded from the point where the two met in the air. It spread out rapidly and covered the entire Imperial City in an instant.</p><p>At that moment, all the powerful cultivators in the imperial capital were shocked. They looked at the place where Lu Ming and Qiu changlie were fighting.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the earth-shaking tremor, the two figures quickly retreated, each retreating a thousand meters.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, the entire place burst into an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight Qiu changlie head-on, and they were even.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was this possible? Tell me, am I blind? what I just saw wasn’t real!”</p><p>“You’re blind, but I’m not. I saw it too.”</p><p>“My God, tianyun was only a martial Grandmaster half a month ago. It’s only been half a month, and he’s already able to fight Qiu changlie. Isn’t this a little too crazy?”</p><p>“I’ve lived my life in vain!”</p><p>Everyone’s nerves seemed to be in a mess as they screamed randomly to vent the shock in their hearts.</p><p>It was simply too shocking.</p><p>“This guy, this guy, this guy!”</p><p>Hua Chi was tongue-tied and almost couldn’t speak.</p><p>Beside him, the few elders of the imperial family were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“Dammit! Dammit! Tianyun, you deserve to die!”</p><p>Qiu changlie roared.</p><p>He, Qiu changlie, was a genius, but he had been in hiding for more than 20 years. His goal was to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat and break through the clouds.</p><p>In the end, he did it. With a single move, he defeated one of the six heroes, Ling Yanchi. His name shook the world and his glory was boundless.</p><p>He enjoyed this kind of glory incomparably. He had a kind of ambition. He wanted to climb all the way up and trample all the other geniuses under his feet. He might even be able to replace Qiu changkong.</p><p>However, to think that he would actually be stopped by an ant-like tianyun! This caused his reputation to be somewhat imperfect.</p><p>Unforgivable, absolutely unforgivable.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Qiu changlie’s body flashed with a blood-red light as a ferocious Tiger charged out.</p><p>This ferocious Tiger had a pair of wings on its back, and its aura soared into the sky.</p><p>Around the Tiger, there was a dazzling silver chakra.</p><p>King level first class bloodline!</p><p>“Tianyun, I have a King tier bloodline, and I’m a natural-born King. Why don’t you die?”</p><p>Qiu changlie bellowed. His aura was incomparably powerful as he slashed his sword toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Natural King?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. His body shook and a blood-red light shot out. Then, a huge stone tablet emerged.</p><p>The three silver chakras on the stone tablet were so bright that they almost blinded the others.</p><p>“Oh heavens, Oh earth, what am I seeing? Three silver chakra?”</p><p>“A third level royal bloodline, it’s actually a third level royal bloodline? How is that possible?”</p><p>monster, he’s a real monster!</p><p>The crowd’s mood that had finally calmed down was turned upside down again.</p><p>Everyone let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>Hua Chi’s dumbfounded expression turned into a bitter smile.</p><p>He had tried his best to overestimate Lu Ming. However, he realized that he was wrong every time. He had always underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, no, this is impossible!”</p><p>Qiu changlie’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets as he shrieked in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and blocked Qiu changlie’s sword gleam. He then looked at Qiu changlie with a cold smile and said,”What’s impossible? It’s just a third level King bloodline, how big of a deal is that? What was there to be surprised about? You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well.”</p><p>There was a seventh tier King level bloodline genius standing next to him. Lu Ming did not think that a third level King level bloodline was a big deal.</p><p>“Kill, kill, so what if it’s a third level king class bloodline? You’ll still die today!”</p><p>Qiu changlie roared. He was so jealous that he was about to go crazy.</p><p>In his heart, tianyun was just like an ant. He had actually awakened a third level King bloodline, which was two levels higher than him. This was unforgivable. He must kill Lu Ming. He could not allow Lu Ming to live in this world.</p><p>Just now, he was still feeling smug and self-proclaimed to be a natural-born King, looking down on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, Lu Ming erupted with a third level King level Blood Meridian.</p><p>His Blood Meridian was trash compared to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>This was like a slap to his own face. This made his killing intent towards Lu Ming even stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Qiu changlie’s sword trembled as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear trembled as he charged toward Qiu changlie.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>One had to admit that Qiu changlie was indeed extremely powerful, far more powerful than the other young experts of his generation.</p><p>He was at the peak of the 3rd level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>His force had reached the phenomenal success stage, and he had also cultivated a low Earth grade martial skill to the fourth stage.</p><p>The cultivation technique he practiced should be a low Earth level cultivation technique. With the first class King bloodline, he could kill a peak fourth level martial ancestor realm martial artist with one move, let alone a martial artist of the same level as him. He could cross two levels and fight with a peak fifth level martial ancestor realm martial artist.</p><p>It was not easy for Lu Ming to win since his cultivation level was more than a level lower.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not use any earth level martial arts technique.</p><p>He wanted to use the power of wind and Fire to fight against Qiu changlie. He wanted to use Qiu changlie’s hands to temper the power of wind and Fire so that the power of wind and Fire could be completely fused as soon as possible.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed and Lu Ming was gradually at a disadvantage.</p><p>After all, he didn’t use an earth rank martial skill, so he suffered a great loss in this aspect.</p><p>“Tianyun is going to be defeated!”</p><p>“Seems like Qiu changlie is still stronger. However, for tianyun to be able to fight Qiu changlie to this extent, it’s already extremely terrifying.”</p><p>“With tianyun’s bloodline, he might be able to surpass Qiu changlie in time.”</p><p>The people watching the battle couldn’t help but express their opinions.</p><p>In the crowd, Hua Chi had a worried expression.</p><p>“Elders, if tianyun is no match for you later on, you must save tianyun no matter what price you have to pay,”</p><p>Hua Chi secretly sent a message to the imperial family elders.</p><p>“Eighth prince, don’t worry. We will protect young master tianyun even if it means our lives.”</p><p>A few imperial family elders said.</p><p>Only then did Hua Chi relax a little and continue to watch the battle.</p><p>“Haha, tianyun, go to hell!”</p><p>Qiu changlie let out a long howl. His aura was like a rainbow. Dazzling sword Qi continued to burst out, determined to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming turned a deaf ear to everything in the outside world. He was completely immersed in his own world, in the world of Wind and Fire.</p><p>“Soon, soon. Just a little bit more and the wind and Fire will be completely fused together. Just a little bit more.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He waved the long spear in his hand at an increasing speed. The space was filled with spear shadows. Moreover, each spear shadow was more powerful than the last.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt that the Wind and Fire had reached a point. When they reached this point, the Wind and Fire had completely fused together.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook. The power of wind and Fire combined and exploded into a terrifying wave, destroying Qiu changlie’s sword radiance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the long spear shook and stabbed out like a real Dragon. The power of wind and Fire fused together and exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu changlie let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying several thousand meters away.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
