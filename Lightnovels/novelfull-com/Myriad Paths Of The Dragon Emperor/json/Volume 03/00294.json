Why did tianyun suddenly unleash his full power and send Qiu changlie flying with a single strike, severely injuring him?</p><p>Could it be that tianyun had been hiding his strength all along?</p><p>“Haha, Qiu changlie, thank you. Thank you for sparring with me just now, allowing me to cultivate a martial skill.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The countless spectators looked at each other and then came to a realization.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually borrowed Qiu changlie’s help to cultivate a unique skill.</p><p>The crowd was speechless. Lu Ming was actually using Qiu changlie to cultivate. It was crazy. The craziest thing was that he had actually succeeded.</p><p>“Ah, ah, tianyun …”</p><p>Qiu changlie howled into the sky and spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>These few mouthfuls of blood were completely from anger.</p><p>This was an insult. This was an insult.</p><p>Qiu changlie felt as if his anger was about to burst out of his chest.</p><p>“What are you screaming for? It’s your honor to be able to let me use you to cultivate.”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air and chided indifferently.</p><p>Wasn’t Qiu changlie crazy? I’m more arrogant than you.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming pulled the spear down.</p><p>The power of wind and Fire naturally fused together, erupting with a terrifying power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu changlie’s sword Qi was instantly destroyed, and the spear continued to strike Qiu changlie.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu changlie was sent flying like a rubber ball. His body was almost blown apart, and he was spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Crushing, a complete crushing.</p><p>the power of wind and Fire is actually so strong when completely fused? ”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed in his heart.</p><p>The power of the fusion of Wind and Fire had greatly exceeded Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that the power of the fusion of Wind and Fire should be equivalent to the sixth level of the low Earth level martial arts technique.</p><p>after force has reached perfection, it’s time to comprehend intent. The natural force of heaven and earth, the natural intent of heaven and earth, contains too many profound mysteries. I’ve only touched the surface of it now. In the future, I’ll have to work harder on force.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>the fusion of Wind and Fire Force will be called Wind and Fire kill. It can be considered a killing move that I comprehended on my own. In the future, as my comprehension of Wind and Fire Force deepened, I might be able to create a set of martial skills that belongs to me.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qiu changlie howled as he turned around to run.</p><p>However, Lu Ming caught up with him in a few steps.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few spear strikes landed on Qiu changlie’s body, causing him to scream in pain. It was unknown how many bones in his body had been broken, and he was almost unable to fly. He was barely able to remain in the air.</p><p>The entire arena fell silent. Qiu changlie was no match for tianyun at all. This was a one-sided battle.</p><p>“Tianyun, stop. This battle ends here. I admit that your strength is indeed slightly stronger than mine.”</p><p>Qiu changlie shouted.</p><p>“Stop? Have you forgotten that we have agreed to a life-and-death battle, one that will not end until one of us is dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered as he walked toward Qiu changlie.</p><p>Qiu changlie used the last of his strength to retreat as he shouted,”No, you can’t kill me. Tianyun, I’m warning you. I’m the peerless genius of the ten direction Sword School, and I’m destined to become a figure at the peak of the world. If you kill me, the ten direction Sword School will never let you off.”</p><p>what a joke. You and I have a life-and-death battle. Neither side will pursue the matter. This is the rule of martial arts. If the ten directions Sword School pursues the matter because of this, it will be breaking the rule of martial arts and making an enemy of all martial arts cultivators in the world. I would like to see if the ten directions Sword School has the ability to do so.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response. At the same time, he closed in on Qiu changlie with a bone-chilling murderous intent.</p><p>no, tianyun, you can’t do this. Let me tell you, if you really kill me, no one can protect you. Don’t think that the royal family can protect you. Let me tell you, the royal family will be destroyed sooner or later, and the ten direction Sword School will unify the blazing sun Empire sooner or later. When that time comes, there will be no place for you in the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Qiu changlie bellowed and even tried to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? That’s a matter for the future. I’ll kill you first.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He was already close to Qiu changlie. He extended his palm and tried to grab Qiu changlie.</p><p>Qiu changlie was already on the verge of death. He had no way of resisting and was held by his throat by Lu Ming.</p><p>His body began to struggle violently, and his eyes were filled with fear and despair.</p><p>“Just now, didn’t you say that you wanted me to understand what despair is? Now, you should understand, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu changlie coldly and said with a hint of mockery.</p><p>Just now, Qiu changlie had arrogantly told Lu Ming that he wanted him to understand what despair was. Now, he understood.</p><p>“No… Please don’t kill me, I beg you, I beg you.”</p><p>Qiu changlie shouted out with all his might.</p><p>He was truly terrified and desperate.</p><p>The experts of the ten directions sword sect had all rushed back to the ten directions sword sect to discuss an important matter. He was the strongest among those who remained in the imperial capital, so no one would come to save him.</p><p>It was useless even if he came.</p><p>However, he didn’t want to die. He was a peerless genius with a great future. He really didn’t want to die.</p><p>At that moment, he was filled with regret. Why did he have to provoke Lu Ming?</p><p>Now, he understood one thing. There were some people that he could never afford to offend.</p><p>But it was too late to realize it now.</p><p>“It’s too late to beg me now.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed coldly, then his essential Qi exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu changlie’s body exploded in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly controlled his Blood Meridian and devoured Qiu changlie’s blood essence. Of course, he would not let go of his storage ring.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>At this moment, it was as if the entire imperial capital had fallen silent.</p><p>Qiu changlie had been killed by tianyun.</p><p>This genius who had just risen and was about to become one of the seven heroes of the scorching sun had been killed just like that.</p><p>“It’s too … This tianyun is too domineering.”</p><p>he’s really a ruthless man. The higher-ups of the ten directions Sword School are probably going crazy now that Qiu changlie has been killed.</p><p>“So what if I go crazy? Tianyun and Qiu changlie are fighting to the death according to the rules of martial arts. Would the ten directions sword sect dare to interfere?”</p><p>“Even if we don’t interfere openly, we can do it in the dark.”</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>In the imperial capital, countless people were discussing excitedly.</p><p>Of course, there were also people who sighed. The path of martial arts was just so cruel. No matter how talented you were, you could die at the hands of a stronger genius.</p><p>The fall of a genius represented the rise of another genius.</p><p>From now on, there would be one more top genius in the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>That was tianyun!</p><p>“He really killed Qiu changlie?”</p><p>At the edge of the pool, a few imperial family elders were still in disbelief.</p><p>“This is his style!”</p><p>Hua Chi smiled bitterly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and appeared at the edge of the pool. “Let’s go to the general Star Hall.”</p><p>After being delayed by the people from the omnidirectional sword sect for such a long time, Lu Ming could not wait to see Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Hua Chi nodded. Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the Golden-eyed blood corpse followed him to the general Star Hall.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
