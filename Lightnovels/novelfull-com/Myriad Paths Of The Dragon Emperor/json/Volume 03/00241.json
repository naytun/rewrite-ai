They were naturally allowed to go up and fight against the person who was about to win six consecutive victories. Moreover, there was no need to test.</p><p>Not long after, the old lady passed the test and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The audience in the surrounding stands burst out in fierce roars as they looked at the fighting ring in anticipation.</p><p>They needed to see a bloody battle. That would be exciting enough.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, the young man and the old woman were moved by the surrounding atmosphere. They roared and charged at each other.</p><p>The young man was using a sword, while the old woman was using a thin and long blade. The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The old woman’s saber technique was extremely sharp, and she was experienced. Her attacks were fierce, and the young man was no match for her in just twenty moves.</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>Just as the young man was about to admit defeat, the old woman’s Saber Light suddenly accelerated.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The young man’s head was cut off by the old woman’s Saber Light before he could even say that he wanted to admit defeat.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Wonderful!”</p><p>The surrounding stands were filled with excited screams and clamors.</p><p>you’ve killed this person and replaced him, obtaining six consecutive victories. Now, do you still want to continue the challenge? ”</p><p>The judge asked the old woman.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>The old woman said.</p><p>This old woman was very powerful. She had obviously cultivated for many years, and her martial arts skills were very profound. She won consecutively, and then won three more battles, obtaining nine consecutive victories.</p><p>At this moment, the old woman shook her head, indicating that she would not continue the challenge.</p><p>The more she challenged, the stronger the people below would be. She was no longer confident.</p><p>The surrounding audience was greatly disappointed. They naturally wanted to continue watching, because the further down they went, the more exciting it would be.</p><p>The old woman received 1000 spiritual crystals and left the fighting ring.</p><p>“Who’s going to challenge me next?”</p><p>The judge’s voice echoed throughout the entire arena.</p><p>“I’ll go have some fun!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and chuckled.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, you’re going to make a move?”</p><p>Ming Feng’s eyes shone with excitement.</p><p>Ming Cheng also revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>They were not worried about Lu Ming at all. They did not believe that Lu Ming would lose in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>When the judge saw that someone had entered the arena, he smiled and said,”Little brother, please register your cultivation and pay the fee!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and took out fifty spirit crystals to register.</p><p>“I’m a sixth grade great Martial Master. Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings. His voice was not loud but it spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>“What? He’s a sixth grade great master, so young?”</p><p>Most of the audience in the stands were shocked.</p><p>The audience in the stands came from all over the imperial capital. Most of them did not know Lu Ming.</p><p>“Could he be a top genius from the five great sects?”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>For a moment, no one went on stage.</p><p>The younger they were, the higher their cultivation. They were usually geniuses, and their battle prowess was difficult to measure. They didn’t want to die in vain.</p><p>I know him. He’s tianyun, a peerless genius of the general stars Hall. He’s extremely powerful. Half a month ago, in the blood ant secret realm, he killed yang Zaitian, a peerless genius of the ten directions Sword School. He robbed most of the storage rings of the ten directions Sword school’s disciples by himself!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“It’s him? So he’s tianyun!”</p><p>Waves of exclamations came from the stands.</p><p>In the past half a month, tianyun’s name had spread throughout the imperial capital, and the incident in the blood ant realm had also spread throughout the capital.</p><p>“How can such a genius fight someone of the same level?”</p><p>“Yup!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He did not expect that it was not good to be too famous. There was no one to fight now.</p><p>“Who’s up for a fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted again.</p><p>But still, no one went up.</p><p>After a moment, a burly man stood up and said, ” “Young master tianyun, I’ll fight with you, but we’ll only be sparring. What do you think?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and quickly agreed.</p><p>He wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, so he didn’t necessarily have to fight to the death. He would be satisfied as long as someone went up to the stage.</p><p>The burly man moved and stepped onto the fighting ring, standing opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is going to be interesting!”</p><p>The audience in the stands all showed an expression of anticipation.</p><p>Although tianyun’s name had spread throughout the imperial capital recently, there were still very few people who had personally witnessed Lu Ming in action. Naturally, everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>A large saber appeared in the middle-aged man’s hand and he looked at Lu Ming cautiously.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and stood calmly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The middle-aged man didn’t hesitate any longer and launched an attack.</p><p>As soon as he attacked, he slashed eighteen times in a row, each faster than the last.</p><p>The saber ray whizzed and locked Lu Ming down.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to make a move. He used the midair step and his figure flashed slightly, leaving the burly man’s attack range.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The burly man roared and attacked like a tide. The snow-white Saber Light attacked Lu Ming layer by layer.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm and indifferent. His body was as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. He swayed slightly, causing the burly man’s Saber Light to miss.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the long spear in Lu Ming’s hands stabbed out toward the burly man’s Saber Light.</p><p>With just a casual stab, the burly man’s knife light disappeared, and his body became even more like a thug.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The burly man shouted. Lu Ming did not use much strength and his saber technique was broken with just a casual thrust of the spear.</p><p>He found it hard to accept.</p><p>your saber technique is a black grade low level saber technique. It should be a combination of strength and gentleness, but you’ve been pursuing speed and power, which has fallen into a disadvantage. Therefore, your saber technique has been stuck at the fourth level, and it’s difficult to break through to the fifth level.</p><p>Lu Ming said slowly, word by word.</p><p>However, these words were like a bolt of lightning in the middle-aged man’s ears.</p><p>He was stunned. His eyes flickered as if he was thinking about something.</p><p>A moment later, the middle-aged man was overjoyed. He suddenly struck out with his saber, and twenty-seven saber lights appeared instantly. They were extremely dazzling, and their power was much stronger than before.</p><p>“Haha, my saber technique has broken through!”</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed and looked at Lu Ming. He suddenly cupped his fists and bowed deeply, saying,”Thank you, young master tianyun, for your guidance. I’ve been enlightened. Otherwise, I don’t know how long it would have taken for me to make a breakthrough in my saber technique. Young master tianyun is a genius. I’m truly impressed.”</p><p>you’re welcome. You were able to break through because of your own comprehension ability. I was just throwing bricks to guide the Jade. Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had even successfully cultivated an earth level martial arts technique. His outlook was naturally different.</p><p>The middle-aged man had only cultivated a black level low-rank martial arts technique. Although Lu Ming had not cultivated any saber techniques, he had seen the world.</p><p>When the middle-aged man made a few moves, Lu Ming could see the man’s weakness and insufficiencies. He gave him a few casual pointers and did not expect the middle-aged man to make a breakthrough in his saber technique in one go.</p><p>“No matter what? Young master tianyun’s kindness is something that I can not thank enough for!”</p><p>The middle-aged man saluted again, then turned around and left the fighting ring.</p><p>It was obvious that he had admitted defeat.</p><p>The audience in the stands were dumbfounded.</p><p>This works too?</p><p>Immediately, a white-haired old man hurriedly jumped onto the fighting ring and cupped his fists. He said very politely, ” “I’m Xiang mu, please give me some pointers, young master tianyun!”</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
