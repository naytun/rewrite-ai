They were both injured and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>The two of them gritted their teeth and ran forward.</p><p>Not long after, they ran another few hundred miles.</p><p>not good! It’s the blood Realm and the Devil’s Den ahead.</p><p>The elder from the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>stop! You’ll all die if you enter the blood Realm and Devil’s Den!</p><p>“Quickly stop them and ask for Lu Yuntian’s whereabouts.”</p><p>The other members of the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>Not far ahead, a thick fog covered the area, and the blood mist rose. It was boundless.</p><p>One look and one could tell that it was a place of great danger.</p><p>“Blood territory and Devil’s Den?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had not heard of it.</p><p>Looking at Xie nianqing, she was also confused.</p><p>I don’t care anymore. It looks like the people from the ten direction Sword School are very afraid. The more dangerous a place is, the easier it is to escape!</p><p>Lu Ming decided to rush in.</p><p>It didn’t stop at all and rushed towards the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Stop them!”</p><p>The elder from the omnipresent sword sect bellowed repeatedly and slashed out sword Qi with all his might. However, it accelerated the speed of Lu Ming and his companion.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>Suddenly, an angry shout came from the sky, and a glass-like sword light slashed from the distance. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Young master changkong!”</p><p>The people from the ten directions Sword School shouted excitedly.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Although the sword Qi was still very far away, its power surpassed that of the 4th martial ancestor realm elder.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming activated his Blood Meridian and condensed four ancient shields at the same time. Then, he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Human Dao palm!</p><p>&Nbsp; a massive palm print fused with Wind and Fire energy shot forward.</p><p>Xie nianqing, on the other hand, was covered in Black Lotus flowers in front of him. At the same time, he sent out three black palm prints.</p><p>Demonic palm!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword radiance arrived in an instant and was the first to collide with the human path palm print and the heavenly demonic palm print.</p><p>Instant sword. Qiu changkong’s sword Qi glowed even more brightly, illuminating the entire sky. The light passed through Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s palm prints and continued to hit their defensive martial arts.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s bodies trembled. They groaned and spat out a mouthful of blood. Their bodies were thrown back and they crossed a thousand meters in an instant.</p><p>“Enter the blood Realm and Devil’s Den!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. He and Xie nianqing struck forward with their palms again. The powerful force pushed them back. The next moment, they disappeared into the mist of the blood Realm and Devil’s Den.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Six figures appeared and stopped outside the blood Realm and Devil’s Den.</p><p>Then, a sword light flashed, and Qiu changkong appeared.</p><p>However, his face was extremely gloomy as he stared at the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave in front of him.</p><p>“Young master changkong, don’t be rash!”</p><p>An old man shouted. He was afraid that Qiu changkong would rush in on a whim.</p><p>The blood Realm and Devil’s Cave was a legendary forbidden land. Unless one was a martial King, they would only die if they rushed in.</p><p>No one under the rank of martial King had ever come out alive.</p><p>Qiu changkong fell silent for a moment, but he still didn’t rush in.</p><p>“Leave a few people here to guard this place. If those two really come out, kill them without mercy.”</p><p>Qiu changkong instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The others bowed and acknowledged.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Yuntian, no matter who saved you, no matter where you’re hiding, I’m going to find you.”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s voice was as cold as the tip of a sword.</p><p>After that, Qiu changkong stepped out and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Two of them left with Qiu changkong, leaving four behind to guard the place.</p><p>……</p><p>The moment Lu Ming and Xie nianqing rushed into the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave, they felt the world spinning. When they calmed down, they found themselves in a desolate land.</p><p>Not a single blade of grass grew on the ground, and a blood-colored mist floated in the air. He looked around, but found that he couldn’t find the direction at all, and he didn’t know where he had come from.</p><p>“I’ve implicated you this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing and sighed.</p><p>“Don’t think too much. My goal is to step on you.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He could not figure out Xie nianqing’s temper at all.</p><p>However, no matter what, it was all thanks to Xie nianqing. Otherwise, it would not have been so easy to save Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“Let’s find a place to recuperate!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After blocking the attacks of the fourth-tier martial Grandmaster realm and Qiu changkong’s sword, both of them had suffered serious injuries.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted, picked a random direction, and walked forward.</p><p>Lu Ming followed.</p><p>Even though the forsaken land was desolate, there were still living beings that appeared.</p><p>However, this place was absolutely dead silent. The earth was reddish-brown, and there was not even a single blade of grass. It was completely bare.</p><p>The two of them walked for dozens of miles, and everything around them was the same.</p><p>There was no direction, no life, and no way out.</p><p>“Let’s recuperate first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This time, Xie nianqing didn’t refute. The two of them sat down and began to heal.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>This was because he felt that there was no spiritual Qi in the world, only a brutal and wild aura.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also a little shocked.</p><p>Then, they took out spiritual crystals and started to absorb the spiritual Qi in them to heal.</p><p>After half a day, the two’s injuries were much better, and they continued to move forward.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the two of them discovered that the blood-colored mist around them was much thicker than before, greatly reducing their visibility.</p><p>Even with their cultivation, they could only see a few hundred meters away. Any further and it would be a blur.</p><p>The two of them raised their vigilance and continued forward.</p><p>As time passed, the blood-colored mist became thicker and thicker.</p><p>Their visibility dropped from hundreds of meters to 100 meters, then 80 meters, 60 meters, and 50 meters.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, a roar came from the distance.</p><p>The two of them looked serious.</p><p>There were living beings in the fog?</p><p>They hadn’t encountered one in such a long time, but now it had suddenly appeared, full of strangeness.</p><p>The two of them were highly focused and did not continue forward. They stopped and looked around.</p><p>The mist was getting thicker and thicker. The blood-colored mist was almost solid, like dark red blood.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>In the surroundings, more and more howls could be heard, and they became more and more concentrated. It was unknown how many there were.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a roar came from beside the two of them. A murderous aura filled the air, and a bloody mist billowed. A pale white Claw grabbed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>This claw was like a human palm, but its nails were long and as sharp as blades. Its arm was covered in green hair.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression changed. He waved his hand and a Black Lotus appeared. The petals flew out and attacked the pale claw.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Lotus petals struck the pale claw, producing a metallic sound and sparks.</p><p>It was actually not cut in half.</p><p>However, this attack also caused the pale white Claw to withdraw. The fog churned, and the two seemed to see a tall figure that instantly disappeared into the distance.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
