Do you want to come along?”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Ditian battle arena!” Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he looked interested.</p><p>The Emperor Sky Battle arena was extremely famous. It could be said that there was no one who did not know of it.</p><p>This was because it was not established by any power in the blazing sun Empire. The Emperor heaven battle arena was established by the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace was an unimaginably powerful force.</p><p>Not to mention the blazing sun Empire, even the 36 empires of the Yun Emperor were all trash in front of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. They could be destroyed with a snap of the finger.</p><p>Even in the entire divine wilderness continent, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was an extremely powerful force.</p><p>The DI Tian battle arena created by the DI Tian divine Palace was spread all over the divine wilderness continent. There were countless of them, big and small.</p><p>Among the 36 empires of Emperor Yun, only one empire had one emperor heaven battle arena.</p><p>In the Ditian battle arena, one could kill and fight at will. One could also earn a lot of spiritual crystals.</p><p>This place was both heaven and hell for martial artists. Here, human lives were like grass, but as long as one had the strength, they could win honor and wealth.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to gain some experience. Perhaps the Emperor Sky Battle arena was a good place to go.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll go find your brother.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Haha, let’s go!”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed. He went to look for Ming city with Lu Ming.</p><p>When Ming Cheng saw that Lu Ming was with him, he was naturally overjoyed. The three of them headed towards the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>The Ditian battle arena was located in the southern part of the imperial capital and occupied an extremely vast area.</p><p>From the outside, the Ditian battle arena was an oval-shaped building that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>There were people standing guard at the main entrance of the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>To enter the Ditian battle arena, everyone had to pay ten spiritual crystals.</p><p>This was the battle arena opened by the Emperor sky divine Palace, and no one dared to not pay. Even the people from the ten directions sword sect had to behave themselves in the Emperor Sky Battle arena.</p><p>The omnipresent Sword School might seem powerful, but that was only in the burning sun Empire.</p><p>When facing a power like the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the difference was simply too great.</p><p>Perhaps a random servant from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace could annihilate the ten direction sword sect with a flick of his finger.</p><p>Each of them paid ten spiritual crystals and the three of them walked into the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>When they entered, they discovered that the Ditian battle arena was even wider than they had imagined.</p><p>The Ditian battle arena was surrounded by densely packed stands. There were at least dozens of levels and it would have no problem accommodating hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>In the center of the arena, there was a fighting ring that was 200 meters long and wide.</p><p>At this moment, there were two figures engaged in an intense battle on the fighting ring.</p><p>Shouts came from all around like a tide.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd on the grandstand. It was bustling and not very dense, but Lu Ming estimated that there were tens of thousands of people.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed. The Emperor Sky Battle arena was really profitable. Even if there were only tens of thousands of people watching every day, the daily income was hundreds of thousands of spirit crystals.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>On the arena, two burly middle-aged men roared and charged at each other, their killing intent surging.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Both of them were first grade great martial masters, and they exchanged dozens of moves. In the end, the yellow-robed man won and cut off the other party’s head.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve finally achieved six consecutive victories.”</p><p>The yellow-robed man laughed.</p><p>“Six consecutive wins? There should be a reward of 100 spiritual crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>According to the rules of the Ditian battle arena, anyone could go up to the stage to challenge as long as they paid a handling fee of 50 spiritual crystals.</p><p>In the beginning, it was a battle between equals.</p><p>The first five matches were very casual. You could challenge anyone, and there would be no rewards.</p><p>From the sixth round onwards, the Ditian battle arena would arrange for stronger opponents. The winner would be rewarded with 100 spiritual crystals.</p><p>100 spiritual crystals for six consecutive wins, 200 for seven consecutive wins, 500 for eight consecutive wins, and 2000 spiritual crystals for ten consecutive wins.</p><p>After ten consecutive wins, if one wanted to continue the challenge, they could not challenge Warriors of the same level but had to challenge Warriors one level higher than them.</p><p>Challenging opponents one level higher. Moreover, Di Tian battle arena would not allow you to challenge as you please. They would only arrange for opponents who were stronger.</p><p>For one win, one could get 5000 crystals, 10000 for two wins, 20000 for three wins, and 10000 for each win after that.</p><p>The reward was 90000 crystals for winning 10 consecutive battles.</p><p>At this time, if he wanted to continue the challenge, he would have to cross two levels to fight.</p><p>Of course, the rewards would be even better.</p><p>He would get 100000 crystals for winning a battle two levels above him, and 100000 more for every subsequent victory.</p><p>If one could win ten times in a row, two levels higher, the reward would be one million spiritual crystals, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The higher the level, the more terrifying the reward.</p><p>This would naturally attract countless geniuses to come and challenge him.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue the challenge?”</p><p>The judge of the Ditian battle arena asked.</p><p>“Yes, of course I want it!”</p><p>The yellow-robed man was full of confidence.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll make the arrangements.”</p><p>The judge said.</p><p>Soon, a white-haired elder walked up to the fighting ring. He was also a first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them started fighting.</p><p>But this time, the old man was obviously better. After about a hundred moves, he sent the yellow-robed man flying back with a punch.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The yellow-robed man hurriedly shouted.</p><p>In the Ditian battle arena, one could kill as they wished. If they did not admit defeat, they would only die.</p><p>The yellow-robed man admitted defeat, and the white-haired old man also stopped.</p><p>After that, the yellow-robed man received the reward of 100 spiritual crystals and left the fighting ring.</p><p>The white-haired old man also got off the platform.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?”</p><p>The judge roared as he swept his gaze across the entire arena.</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>A young man in his 20s jumped onto the fighting ring, registered himself, and paid 50 spiritual crystals.</p><p>I’m a second grade great Martial Master. Who’s going to challenge me? ”</p><p>The young man said loudly as he scanned the crowd.</p><p>“I’ll try.”</p><p>A burly man leaped onto the fighting ring and started fighting with the young man. However, he was defeated by the young man after a dozen moves.</p><p>After that, more and more people went up to challenge him, but they were all defeated by the young man.</p><p>It was obvious that this young man was a genius. He was extremely powerful and had defeated five people in a row.</p><p>Five consecutive wins, five consecutive wins from a young man.</p><p>“Who else wants to come up for a fight?”</p><p>The young man was in high spirits.</p><p>But for a moment, no one stepped forward.</p><p>After a long while, an old woman finally jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“We want to test your strength.”</p><p>The judge said.</p><p>The old woman nodded and followed the judge into a stone door.</p><p>After the five consecutive victories, the Ditian battle arena would not allow anyone to challenge them as they wished. They would test the strength of each opponent. Those who were not strong enough would not be qualified to challenge them.</p><p>Otherwise, as long as someone colluded with a group of people, they could easily win the competition and obtain the rewards. In that case, the DI Tian battle arena would suffer a huge loss.</p><p>Moreover, in that case, there would be nothing to see in the martial arts competition.</p><p>The audience was here to see an intense battle.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
