He actually dares to speak to Bai Long like that. He’s finished.</p><p>Liu Mazi was about to leave but he stopped at that moment. He laughed in his heart when he saw Lu Ming talking to Bai Long in such a manner, gloating over his misfortune.</p><p>He would be lying if he said that he did not resent Lu Ming for what he did to him just now. It was just that he was not as powerful as Lu Ming and could only swallow his anger.</p><p>Now that he saw that Lu Ming had actually offended Bai Long, he was naturally overjoyed. He hoped that Bai Long would teach Lu Ming a harsh lesson.</p><p>The others were the same, gloating at his misfortune.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>Bai Long’s face was cold as he asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“Are you deaf? I told you to get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Bai Long laughed out of extreme anger, and a cold killing intent exploded from his body. He glared at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, it has been a long time since anyone has dared to talk to me like this in the outer Palace. You are the first one. It seems like some ants are going to turn the sky upside down after I haven’t fought for a long time. Today, I will give you an unforgettable lesson.”</p><p>With that, he took a few steps forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Bailong’s fist rumbled out, and a terrifying whistling sound instantly rang out.</p><p>This punch was extremely shocking. The fist force was so powerful that it could even shatter a mountain.</p><p>Bai Long’s lips curled into a sinister smile. He wanted to break all the bones in Lu Ming’s body with one punch.</p><p>In the world of martial artists, no matter where one was, strength spoke the loudest. It was extremely normal for one to draw a sword and kill someone if they did not agree with one another.</p><p>“I originally didn’t want to make a move today, but there’s a group of people who are looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and waved his palm at Bai Long.</p><p>The moment he waved his hand, a long spear was formed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The tip of the spear pierced through everything, and Bai Long’s terrifying fist energy was pierced through like tofu.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Bai Long screamed and quickly retreated.</p><p>Liu Mazi and the others were shocked. They quickly looked at Bai Long and gasped.</p><p>A hole appeared on Bai Long’s fist, from which white bones could be seen and blood was flowing out.</p><p>The hole went straight through his arm, as if it had been blasted open. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Bai Long’s body trembled non-stop. His face was pale and cold sweat was flowing down his face. He let out a low roar.</p><p>with that little ability of yours, you still have that expression of blowing the sky up. I’m really speechless. Now, you better get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re ruthless, but today’s matter isn’t over yet. Just you wait!”</p><p>Bai Long roared and fled the place in a sorry state.</p><p>“You’re still here? Do you want to be like Bai Long?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Liu Mazi and the rest with a faint smile.</p><p>The expressions of Liu Mazi and the others changed drastically, and they were almost scared out of their wits.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful. He had crippled Bai Long’s hand with one move. How could they afford to offend such a ruthless person?</p><p>“Go! I’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>Liu Mazi shouted and quickly walked towards the stone stairs. The others followed closely behind. When they reached the second floor, Liu Mazi stopped.</p><p>“Liu Pozi, what’s wrong? Haven’t you been taught a lesson enough? you still want to stay and get abused?”</p><p>One of the young men sneered and gloated.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Liu Mazi shouted coldly. His face was extremely gloomy as he said,”That kid is strong, but he’s brainless. He even dared to hurt Bai Long. Now that Bai Long is injured, he’ll definitely go back and ask his big brother bai chi. Once bai chi comes, this kid is dead for sure. Of course I’ll stay and watch the show!”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the other young men’s expressions changed.</p><p>“That’s right. Bai chi is one of the top ten Warriors of the outer Palace. With him here, that kid is finished.”</p><p>“I also want to stay and watch the show!”</p><p>The young men spoke one after another. They then sat down cross-legged on the second floor, waiting for bai chi to arrive.</p><p>The third floor.</p><p>big brother tianyun, you’re really too amazing. When will I be as amazing as you? no, it’ll be good if I’m only half as amazing as you!</p><p>Ming Feng looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was already his idol.</p><p>“As long as you work hard in your cultivation, you’ll be able to catch up to me very soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the secret room. He sensed it carefully and shook his head.</p><p>Although the fire-type spiritual energy in the secret room was rich, it did not meet Lu Ming’s requirements.</p><p>He needed to continue down.</p><p>“Ming Feng, you can use this secret room for your cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“For me? Big brother tianyun, what about you?”</p><p>Ming Feng asked.</p><p>“I want to continue going down. This place isn’t very effective for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright then, I won’t stand on ceremony!”</p><p>Ming Feng’s eyes lit up with excitement as he walked into the secret room.</p><p>big brother tianyun, I’ll be closing my door to cultivate then!</p><p>Ming Feng shouted. Seeing Lu Ming nod, he pressed a button and the stone door of the secret room closed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to go down.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the fourth floor.</p><p>The fourth floor required twenty-seven inscription stones to open a secret room.</p><p>In the middle of the fourth floor, there were two people sitting cross-legged.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming came down, the two of them looked at him with ill intentions.</p><p>It was obvious that they were also people who wanted to occupy the secret cultivation room.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not take it to heart.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and shook his head. Then, he continued down and walked to the fifth level.</p><p>The two young men’s expressions changed. They watched as Lu Ming walked down to the fifth level. Their eyes flickered but they did not follow him in the end.</p><p>There were no weaklings who could cultivate on the fifth floor. In fact, many of them were students from the general Star Hall inner hall and were experts at the seventh grade great Martial Master realm or above.</p><p>Lu Ming walked down the stairs. When he was close to the fifth level, the power of an inscription acted on him, preventing him from going any further.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and this force was destroyed.</p><p>“It seems like without a certain cultivation, I can’t even cultivate here!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>When he set foot on the fifth level, Lu Ming felt waves of scorching, violent fire-type spiritual energy surging in his surroundings, making his skin feel numb and itchy.</p><p>no wonder there are inscriptions here. The fire spiritual Qi here is too hot and violent. Ordinary people would die if they were to be hit by this spiritual Qi. Weaker martial artists who cultivate here for a long time would even have their meridians burned.</p><p>“However, this spiritual Qi is just right for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>There were more than a dozen secret chambers around the fifth floor, and about half of them were occupied with people cultivating.</p><p>There was no one in the open space.</p><p>No one had occupied the secret cultivation room.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the front of a secret room and took out eighty-one inscription stones.</p><p>That’s right, the fifth floor required 81 inscription stones to open a secret room and cultivate for a month.</p><p>Embed the rune stone on the stone door, and the stone door will release</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door and walked in.</p><p>After he entered, he closed the stone door.</p><p>When the stone door was closed, the walls of the secret room glowed with inscriptions, and the fire-attributed spiritual Qi in the secret room became more and more intense.</p><p>The inscription formation in the secret room helped to absorb and gather the spiritual Qi between heaven and earth.</p><p>“The fire-attributed spiritual Qi here seems to be surging up from deep underground.”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
