Lu Ming made a bid without any hesitation and added 900 spiritual crystals at once. It was obvious that he was determined to win.</p><p>Mingzhu, Ming Cheng, and Ming Feng were also a little surprised.</p><p>Although this bottle of pills was good, it was only more effective for martial artists at the lower ranks of the Grand Martial Master. With Lu Ming’s cultivation, it would not be of much use. She did not know why Lu Ming was so interested.</p><p>“Are there any more bids?”</p><p>Du Zhi asked.</p><p>No one made a bid.</p><p>After that, du Zhi asked three times, but no one made a bid.</p><p>This bottle of pills naturally belonged to Lu Ming.</p><p>After a while, a beautiful young lady came in with the pills. Lu Ming took out four thousand spiritual crystals and handed them to her.</p><p>“Mingzhu, this bottle of pills is for you.”</p><p>Lu Ming took the pill and passed it to Mingzhu.</p><p>“Give it to me?”</p><p>Mingzhu was stunned.</p><p>At the side, Ming Cheng and Ming Feng were also a little stunned.</p><p>The pill that Lu Ming had bid for earlier was for Mingzhu?</p><p>“I saw that you wanted it just now, so I bought it for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“No, I can’t accept such a precious pill!”</p><p>Although Mingzhu was very eager, she still refused.</p><p>“You’re welcome. It’s just a bottle of pills.” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>sister, just accept it. You can’t waste big brother tianyun’s good intentions!</p><p>Ming Feng chuckled as he blinked his eyes at the Pearl. His eyes were filled with an inexplicable smile.</p><p>“That’s right, second sister, you should accept it!”</p><p>Ming Cheng smiled like a cunning Fox.</p><p>Mingzhu’s face suddenly turned red. It was unknown what she was thinking. Her large eyes were filled with tears, and her voice was as soft as a mosquito,”Thank you very much, young master tianyun.”</p><p>Having said that, he took the bottle from Lu Ming’s hands, his eyes filled with joy.</p><p>At the side, Ming Cheng and Ming Feng grinned. They looked at Lu Ming and then at Mingzhu. They nodded from time to time.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the two of them speechlessly.</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it. He just saw that he wanted the Pearl, so he bought it. It didn’t cost many spiritual crystals, as a way to thank him for the help the Pearl had given him when he entered the general Star Hall.</p><p>The auction continued, item after item being auctioned off.</p><p>Some of them were extremely rare, and the price went up to tens of thousands of crystals. Some were only worth a few hundred crystals.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was a little disappointed. These items were of no use to him and he was not interested in them.</p><p>As for Ming city and Ming Feng, they had their eyes on a few and participated in the bidding.</p><p>Soon, more than a hundred items fell into the hands of different people.</p><p>the next item is the last item of this auction. Of course, it is also the most precious!</p><p>At this moment, du Zhi said loudly.</p><p>“It’s time to auction the finale item.”</p><p>The atmosphere at the scene instantly rose.</p><p>Every auction would have a finale item, and they were all treasures that were extremely rare.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly interested.</p><p>Du Zhi saw that the atmosphere had been raised and revealed a satisfied smile. He clapped his hands and a young lady walked over with a Jade plate.</p><p>The Jade plate was covered with a golden silk gauze, so it was impossible to see what was inside.</p><p>you have to know the use of this treasure. Everyone knows that in the cultivation of martial arts, although the physical body is not the foundation, it is also an extremely important auxiliary path. Those with a strong physical body not only have strong vitality and amazing recovery ability, but it can also greatly enhance the combat power of the martial artist. There are even many other wonderful uses!</p><p>Du Zhi began to explain the uses of the physical body.</p><p>could it be a treasure that can help with physical cultivation? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was immediately aroused.</p><p>Many people at the scene also revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>Du Zhi smiled and continued, ” however, it’s extremely difficult to train one’s physical body. If you rely on cultivation techniques to train slowly, the speed will be extremely slow. It’ll also consume a lot of energy.</p><p>however, there are shortcuts. There are many treasures in the world that can quickly temper the body and enhance the strength of the body in a short time. There are strong and weak treasures, and the effects are different.</p><p>Du Zhi didn’t seem to be in a hurry and explained slowly, but the others were holding it in and immediately shouted.</p><p>“What kind of treasure is it? Why don’t you tell me?”</p><p>that’s right. What is it? open it and see!</p><p>“If you want to know, it’s simple. I’ll ask you a question, and you’ll know.”</p><p>among all the treasures in the world, what is the treasure that has the greatest effect on the physical body? ”</p><p>“What kind of treasure is most effective for the physical body? Needless to say, it was naturally the innate original liquid. Why? Don’t tell me you have the innate original liquid?”</p><p>A voice rang out, somewhat in disbelief.</p><p>There was a sudden silence. Some were shocked, but then they shook their heads secretly.</p><p>Innate original liquid? How was that possible?</p><p>It was said that the connate original liquid was a treasure that could only be formed after millions of years.</p><p>There were even many connate original liquids that were only born when the world was created.</p><p>It was extremely helpful to the body and was known as the number one in the world.</p><p>Of course, there were also differences in the innate original liquid.</p><p>According to the different effects, it was divided into four levels.</p><p>Low-grade, medium-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.</p><p>However, even a low-grade primordial origin liquid was a rare treasure in the world and extremely precious.</p><p>The fire spiritual milk that Lu Ming had obtained back then could also temper the body. However, it was trash when compared to the innate original liquid.</p><p>hahaha, my friend, you guessed right. This treasure is the innate original liquid.</p><p>Du Zhi ha laughed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, it was a big deal. The entire place was in an uproar.</p><p>It really was the innate original liquid, which was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“How is that possible? It really is the primordial original liquid.”</p><p>“Get it, I must get it!”</p><p>Countless people roared, their eyes burning with fire. They looked at the tray in the hands of the young girl on the high platform, wishing they could take it for themselves.</p><p>In guest Room No. 7, Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>The three Ming siblings were so shocked that their mouths were wide open.</p><p>Du Zhi was very satisfied with the reaction of the crowd. The more enthusiastic the crowd was, the higher the price would be later.</p><p>Du Zhi stretched out his hand and pressed it down slightly, saying,”Calm down for a moment.”</p><p>The scene instantly fell silent.</p><p>although this treasure is the innate stock solution, it’s only a low-grade innate stock solution and there’s not much of it.</p><p>Du Zhi said.</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement. It was only normal for it to be of low grade. How could it possibly appear in the blazing sun Empire? even if it did appear, not many people would be able to afford it.</p><p>At this moment, du Zhi reached out and removed the gauze on the tray, revealing a red stone ball.</p><p>“This is the innate original liquid?”</p><p>Everyone revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
