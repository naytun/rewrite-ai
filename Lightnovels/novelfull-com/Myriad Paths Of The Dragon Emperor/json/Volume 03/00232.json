A beam of sword light appeared out of thin air and suspended above yang Zaitian’s head. It was extremely brilliant.</p><p>A terrifying sword Qi rippled out. The soil under yang Zaitian’s feet was stirred up by the sword Qi, like water waves.</p><p>Earth level sword technique!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this was an earth level sword technique.</p><p>earth level sword technique, sword from the sky. Senior brother yang Zaitian has actually practiced it!</p><p>“What? This is an earth grade martial skill! It’s too terrifying! Tianyun’s finished! Once this earth grade sword technique is used, he’s dead for sure!”</p><p>senior brother yang Zaitian is so powerful! This is an earth level martial skill!</p><p>The people from the omnidirectional sword sect discussed excitedly. Some even laughed out loud, thinking that Lu Ming was dead for sure. They could finally vent their anger.</p><p>Everyone from the general Star Hall was filled with shock and frustration.</p><p>The disciples of the ten direction Sword School were too strong, and they had no way of competing with them.</p><p>The number one genius of the general Star Hall’s outer hall had only just comprehended force. Compared to yang Zaitian, he was still far behind.</p><p>“Brother tianyun!”</p><p>Ming Cheng stared straight ahead, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>“Tianyun, do you know the difference between us now? Tremble in front of me! Hahaha!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian laughed crazily. In his mind, Lu Ming would definitely be shocked, then shocked, terrified, and finally desperate when he saw yang Zaitian performing the earth level sword technique.</p><p>Thinking of this, he felt very good.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was only half satisfied when he couldn’t continue.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s expression was calm, indifferent, and even a little disdainful.</p><p>Yes, disdain!</p><p>Yang Zaitian’s heart was filled with anger. His face began to twist and he roared, ” “Tianyun, what’s with that expression? What’s with that expression?”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, but the murderous intent in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>“Ah, go to hell! Sky-covering sword, kill!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared and swung his sword. The sword light suspended above his head slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Before the sword reached him, the terrifying sword intent had already enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only one who knows an earth rank martial skill?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His essential Qi burst forth and he raised one hand to the sky and swung his palm.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space seemed to shake. Then, a huge palm print appeared in the air.</p><p>The handprint was ten meters wide and its shape was no different from a human’s palm, but it was slightly blurry.</p><p>However, its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>It was as if there was a King of humanity inspecting the universe, and an extremely powerful pressure pressed down on everyone.</p><p>“Earth rank martial skill, another Earth rank martial skill?”</p><p>“How is that possible? How was that possible?</p><p>The disciples of the ten direction Sword School shouted. They couldn’t believe that all this was real. They wished they were dreaming.</p><p>“Hahaha, tianyun, tianyun, I knew it! This guy is a freak!”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can you also cultivate an earth rank martial skill? ah, break!”</p><p>Yang Zaitian let out a roar of disbelief. He controlled the sword light and slashed at the palm of humanity.</p><p>BOOM! The palm print and the sword light collided.</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled. Then, a shock wave burst out at the place where the palm print and the sword light met.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The earth trembled, and a huge crater over a hundred meters wide and twenty meters deep was blasted into the ground where the palm print and the sword light met.</p><p>Countless pieces of rock flew everywhere.</p><p>“Retreat! Be careful!”</p><p>The people from the ten directions sword sect and general stars Hall were in chaos. They quickly retreated and waved their weapons to block.</p><p>He retreated a thousand meters before he stopped.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the sky, the light of the palm print brightened, while the light of the sword light quickly dimmed.</p><p>In the end, the sword light exploded, and a figure screamed as he was sent flying like a cannonball. He crashed heavily into the ground, creating a large crater.</p><p>It was yang Zaitian. He had been defeated and was lying in the big pit, coughing up blood.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>The sound of gasps rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in the air, his black hair fluttering in the wind. His aura was demonic, and his body exuded a cold murderous intent.</p><p>“Tianyun, what are you trying to do? Don’t mess around.”</p><p>Sensing the murderous intent from Lu Ming, yang Zaitian shouted in horror.</p><p>I, pingsheng, hate it the most when people threaten me with my family. Since you did that, your fate has already been decided.</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>Step by step, he walked toward yang Zaitian.</p><p>don’t you dare. I’m the peerless genius of the ten directions Sword School and the future pillar of the school. I’m someone who can become the Overlord. If you kill me, the experts of the ten directions Sword School won’t let you off. At that time, you’ll die a miserable death.</p><p>Yang Zaitian struggled hard and shouted.</p><p>“That’s my business, why do you need to worry?”</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved. His killing intent grew colder.</p><p>Yang Zaitian was scared. He was really scared. He could tell that Lu Ming really wanted to kill him.</p><p>“No, you can’t kill me. You’re crazy. You’re crazy.”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared and rushed out of the pit, trying to escape.</p><p>“People Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly and waved his palm. A huge palm print formed in the sky and blasted toward yang Zaitian.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Yang Zaitian roared and burst out crazily. He wanted to resist, but it was to no avail.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palm print hit yang Zaitian directly into the ground, and another big pit appeared on the ground.</p><p>The palm print dissipated, leaving only a lump of meat paste in the pit.</p><p>Yang Zaitian’s body was smashed into pieces by the palm.</p><p>“Yang Zaitian is dead. He was killed.”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School widened their eyes in shock and stared at the scene.</p><p>After a long time, someone reacted and shouted, ” “Go, hurry up and go! This tianyun is a madman!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was like the wind. He stepped on the void and appeared above everyone’s heads in a few steps.</p><p>“Who dares to run? Yang Zaitian will end up like that.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>The disciples of the omnipresent sword sect could not help but stop and look at Lu Ming in fear.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming wanted to kill them as well?</p><p>“Tianyun, what are you trying to do? If you kill so many of our people, the higher-ups of the ten directions Sword School will definitely go crazy. They’ll do everything they can to kill you. At that time, no one will be able to save you.”</p><p>Someone from the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>“Who said I was going to kill you? I only wanted to Rob you. Alright, now hand over your storage rings.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What? A robbery?”</p><p>Everyone from the ten direction sword sect was stunned.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If you don’t want to hand it over, I don’t mind starting a massacre.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>The expressions of the people from the ten direction sword sect changed drastically.</p><p>“I’ll pay.”</p><p>Finally, someone shouted and compromised.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
