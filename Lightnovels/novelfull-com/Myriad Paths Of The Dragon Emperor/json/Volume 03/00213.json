Could it be another student from the general stars Hall?</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and wanted to refuse.</p><p>young master tianyun, you don’t have to reject him so quickly. My young master said that he’s an old friend of yours! the old man said with a smile.</p><p>“An old friend?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled.</p><p>He didn’t have any old friends in the capital.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming thought of a person, Hua Chi.</p><p>However, he was currently in disguise and had changed his name to Tian Yun. How could he possibly be Hua Chi?</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming and the elder left the general Star Hall. There was already a luxurious carriage waiting at the entrance.</p><p>The horse in the carriage was not an ordinary horse, but a flood dragon horse. It had a strong body, a single horn on its head, and its entire body was covered in scales.</p><p>Legend had it that the flood dragon horse had the bloodline of a flood Dragon and could travel 100000 li in a day. It was an extremely precious Mount.</p><p>But this carriage was pulled by three Wyrm-horses.</p><p>The owner of the carriage was definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p>After boarding the carriage, the coachman shouted, and the carriage rushed out like a whirlwind.</p><p>Lu Ming sat in the carriage. It was very stable and he did not feel any bumps at all.</p><p>The old man sat opposite Lu Ming and did not say a word. He closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Soon, the carriage stopped.</p><p>“We’re here. Young master tianyun, please!”</p><p>The old man opened his eyes and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and got off the carriage. However, he was shocked by the scene in front of him.</p><p>They stopped in a wide square. There were many carriages parked in the square. Each carriage was very luxurious, and most of them were pulled by rare beasts.</p><p>In front of the square was a very majestic building with high walls that were resplendent.</p><p>Rows of armored soldiers patrolled on the high wall and the gate. Each soldier gave off a strong aura.</p><p>“This is the Imperial Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he was slightly shocked.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, please!”</p><p>The old man raised his hand and said.</p><p>“Who is your young master?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and asked again.</p><p>The old man smiled gently, I won’t hide it from young master tianyun. My young master is the eighth prince!</p><p>“The eighth prince?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not know any eighth prince.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, please!”</p><p>The old man said again.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and then said.</p><p>Regardless of whether he was the eighth prince or not, Lu Ming was not a timid person.</p><p>He followed the old man and easily walked through the palace gate.</p><p>The Imperial Palace was simply too large, and there were countless pavilions and pagodas.</p><p>The guards in iron armor patrolled back and forth, keeping a tight watch.</p><p>Lu Ming could also vaguely sense that there were many powerful auras hidden within. They were like sleeping true dragons. Once they erupted, it would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. It seemed that the royal family was not as weak as the rumors said. They were still very powerful and should not be underestimated.</p><p>Following the old man, they made many turns, and after a long while, they arrived at a courtyard.</p><p>The courtyard was very large, with hundreds of flowers in full bloom, and the fragrance of the flowers assailed the nose.</p><p>In the middle of the courtyard, there was a small lake. The water was as clear as a mirror.</p><p>There was a Pavilion beside the lake. At this moment, there were a few exquisite dishes and wine on the Jade table in the pavilion.</p><p>In the pavilion, a slender figure wearing a purple dragon robe and a Jade belt stood there.</p><p>He placed his hands behind his back and turned his back to Lu Ming and the rest. He looked at the small lake and seemed to be deep in thought.</p><p>The old man came to this figure and bowed, ” “Your Highness, young master tianyun has arrived,”</p><p>The figure moved slightly, as if it had reacted, and then slowly turned around.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank when he saw the person’s appearance.</p><p>Hua Chi. This person was actually Hua Chi.</p><p>Hua Chi was the eighth prince?</p><p>Wasn’t the surname Hua in the current royal family?</p><p>However, there were so many people with the surname Hua in the world. He had never thought that Hua Chi would be a member of the imperial family, and the eighth prince at that.</p><p>“Lu Ming, long time no see!”</p><p>The eighth prince said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He then cupped his fists and said,”Eighth prince, I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person. My name is tianyun, not Lu Ming,”</p><p>“I was there when you fought with bai chi yesterday. Lu Ming, you may be able to fool others, but you can’t fool me,” Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>especially your temperament during the battle. How can others imitate it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Although he had changed his appearance, Hua Chi was all too familiar with his expression and voice, so it was naturally difficult to hide.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>Lu Ming’s body wriggled and the bone armor moved. His body returned to its original shape. Then, he reached out and wiped his face, revealing his handsome face.</p><p>“Hua Chi, I didn’t expect you to be the eighth prince of the burning sun Empire!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“So what if he’s the eighth prince?”</p><p>Hua Chi sighed. He then waved his hand and said, Lu Ming, come, please have a seat. Let’s have a drink!</p><p>The two of them sat opposite each other. Hua Chi poured wine for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and finished the drink in one gulp.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve heard about your situation. The mystical sword sect is really disappointing!”</p><p>Hua Chi downed his cup and sighed.</p><p>“Haha, what’s there to be disappointed about? I’ll annihilate the Duanmu family sooner or later. As for you, you’re the eighth prince. I really don’t understand why you’ve come to the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and asked.</p><p>Hua Chi was silent. After a long time, he sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sure you know a little about the history of the royal family and the current situation, right?”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>the burning sun royal family used to be so powerful that even the five great sects had to tremble in front of the royal family.</p><p>it’s a pity that there was internal strife in the royal family, and their strength was greatly reduced. The sects rose up, especially the ten directions Sword School, who had rapacious ambitions. They took control of the former emperor and used the Emperor to command the vassals. In the name of the Orthodox lineage, they commanded the world. That’s why they were able to rise so quickly and become stronger and stronger. In the past eight hundred years, they dominated the burning sun Empire and became the strongest sect.</p><p>however, the royal family is the legitimate one. We can’t be controlled by a lowly sect like the ten directions Sword School!</p><p>When he said this, Hua Chi’s eyes flashed with an astonishing light. It was a sort of stubbornness and conviction.</p><p>But soon after, he sighed and said, ” it’s a pity that the citizens of the blazing sun Empire only know of the five major sects. Almost all the geniuses have been recruited by the five major sects.</p><p>“So the royal family established the general stars Hall with the purpose of cultivating their own power?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he asked.</p><p>“Not bad!” Hua Chi replied.</p><p>“It’s so obvious. Doesn’t the ten direction Sword School know?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course the ten direction Sword School knows, but maybe they don’t care and think it’s useless.”</p><p>there’s another reason. The royal family isn’t to be trifled with. The ten direction sword sect doesn’t dare to go too far.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“You don’t dare to go too far? With the current strength of the ten direction Sword School, it shouldn’t be difficult for them to destroy the imperial family, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
