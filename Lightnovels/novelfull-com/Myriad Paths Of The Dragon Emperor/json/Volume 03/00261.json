Just as he was about to hit the ground, the essential Qi in his body burst out. He stomped on the ground heavily and his body continued to drift backward.</p><p>“You want to leave? can you leave today?”</p><p>In the sky, the yellow-robed young man shouted coldly.</p><p>He was shocked and furious. With his cultivation at the peak of the second level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm and his surprise attack, he had not managed to kill Lu Ming with two consecutive slashes. This made him feel extremely humiliated.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man held the sword with both hands and slashed out.</p><p>A terrifying sword light, hundreds of meters long, cut through the void and approached Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Senior brother Huang, I’ll join you!”</p><p>Next to the yellow-robed young man was a white-robed young man. He unsheathed his combat sword and thrust it forward. An extremely sharp sword Qi pierced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched as if he was facing the god of death.</p><p>“Block it, block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. He circulated his essential Qi to the maximum and four ancient shields formed in front of him.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and cast the human path palm. A huge palm print appeared in front of him, carrying the power of wind and Fire, and blasted forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering roar shook the entire dormitory area of the star Hall. One after another, figures rushed out of the dormitories and fled in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s human path palm print, the ancient shield, was shattered. The terrifying force landed on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a cannonball, flying backward. He crashed through two dormitory buildings and flew hundreds of meters away.</p><p>Lu Ming used his long spear to support himself on the ground. He drew a deep line on the ground before he stopped. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Still not dead?”</p><p>In the sky, the two young men were shocked. With their cultivation and combat strength, they could kill a first tier martial arts Grandmaster with a single strike. However, Lu Ming had blocked it head-on. He was only injured but not dead.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two young men’s killing intent burst forth. Their eyes were cold as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>With a few loud roars, a few streams of light broke through the air at an extremely fast speed and arrived above the dormitory building in an instant.</p><p>They were the elders of the general stars Hall.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man and the white-robed young man were extremely domineering. They slashed out with their combat swords, and their sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three elders of the general Star Hall were no match for him and were sent flying hundreds of meters away.</p><p>stop! The ten direction sword sect is too much. You killed my general stars Hall’s students in public. I’d like to see how the ten direction sword sect is going to explain this to the royal family.</p><p>One of the patriarchs shouted as he looked at Lu Ming anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming was the unparalleled genius of the general stars Hall now. He was the hope of the future. Nothing must happen to him.</p><p>However, the two young men from the ten directions Sword School were gold rank disciples of the ten directions Sword School. Their cultivation had reached the peak of the second level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. In addition, they were top geniuses, so their combat strength could even compete with those in the third level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Among the three of them, the strongest was only at the second stage of the martial ancestor realm. The other two were only at the first stage of the martial ancestor realm and were not his match at all.</p><p>“Explanation? Why should we, the ten direction sword sect, have to deal with the royal family? What a joke, tengru has opposed the ten direction Sword School and killed many of their geniuses. He deserves to die. Get out of my way now, or you’ll all die!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man shouted in an overbearing manner.</p><p>The three elders of the general stars Hall had ugly expressions on their faces, but they stood firmly in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft! Lu Ming spat out another mouthful of blood. He leaned on the ground with his long spear and stood up straight, looking at the sky.</p><p>It was indeed the disciples of the ten directions Sword School. It seemed that the ten directions Sword School had been forced into a corner. They had actually sent a gold disciple to directly attack the general Star Hall.</p><p>Then, his gaze fell in the direction of the dormitory. It was already in ruins, and there were constant wails.</p><p>Lu Ming had managed to Dodge the first attack but the others did not have the ability to do so. At least ten people had died under that sword and many more were injured.</p><p>Fortunately, Ming Feng had been living in Ming city during this period of time. Otherwise, it would have been dangerous.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear shaft tightly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>senior brother Huang, there’s no need for so much nonsense. Just kill him directly!</p><p>The white-robed young man was even colder, his gaze as sharp as a sword.</p><p>He took a step forward and charged forward.</p><p>“Hold on, there will be experts soon!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! an elder shouted in rage and charged forward with all his strength.</p><p>The other two elders were the same, but they were not his match at all. After a dozen moves, they were injured and forced to retreat. One of the elders in the first realm of the martial ancestor realm even lost an arm.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man sneered with disdain.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud roar and a snow-white blade light slashed from the distance. It cut through the void and arrived in an instant.</p><p>“Not good, martial ancestor 4-stage!”</p><p>The two young men’s expressions changed, and they each slashed out with their swords. However, they were swept away by the saber radiance and were sent flying thousands of meters.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, several streams of light arrived in an instant.</p><p>There were three people in total, two old men and one young man.</p><p>Hua Chi. This young man was Hua Chi. He was enveloped by an elder’s true Qi, which was why he could walk in the air.</p><p>“I’m here, let’s see who can kill tianyun!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were like lightning as he stared at the two youths from the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>eighth prince, tianyun is going against the ten direction Sword School. He’s trying to destroy the relationship between the ten direction Sword School and the royal family. He has ulterior motives. Be careful, or the royal family might be harmed by him!</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said coldly.</p><p>you don’t have to worry about this. I will find out. Now, get out of the general Star Hall!</p><p>Hua Chi coldly shouted in an extremely domineering manner.</p><p>“You b * stard, Hua, I’m giving face to the royal family by calling you the eighth prince. Don’t be ungrateful!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said angrily.</p><p>This ant, Hua Chi, actually dared to tell him to get lost?</p><p>He was a golden disciple of the ten directions Sword School, a high and mighty figure.</p><p>In the five great sects, gold disciples were extremely rare. Every single one of them was a figure whose name shook the blazing sun Empire, and their status was not much lower than the gold-robed elders.</p><p>This was because they had unlimited potential. They would have no problem becoming gold-robed elders in the future.</p><p>And now, Hua Chi, this ant, was berating them?</p><p>So what if he was the eighth prince?</p><p>Their gazes were extremely cold.</p><p>“If you don’t want to get lost, then I’ll make you get lost. Let me tell you, the imperial capital is, after all, the imperial capital of the imperial family!”</p><p>Hua Chi coldly shouted.</p><p>Beside him, two old men exploded with powerful auras.</p><p>One was in the third level of the martial ancestor realm, while the other was in the fourth level.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man and the white-robed young man showed a look of fear.</p><p>If he was at the third level of the martial ancestor realm, they could still fight him. But at the fourth level, even if they joined forces, they would not be a match for him. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Good, good, good, eighth prince, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said ‘good’ three times in a row, but his voice was extremely gloomy. Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said,”Tianyun, if you’re so capable, then don’t leave the general Star Hall for the rest of your life. We’ll wait for you outside the general Star Hall and see how long the imperial family can protect you.”</p><p>After saying that, the yellow-robed young man and the white-robed young man stepped on the air and disappeared.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
