It was a good place to cultivate.</p><p>Without saying anything, the two of them sat down cross-legged, took out the Yiyuan ancient panaceas, and began to cultivate.</p><p>He took out a Jade bottle and opened the cap. Immediately, a medicinal fragrance filled the air.</p><p>The Yiyuan ancient spiritual pill was a medium Lv 4 medicinal pill. It was of great help to a martial arts Grandmaster and was priceless.</p><p>Lu Ming poured out one pill and swallowed it. In an instant, a powerful devouring force came from the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. The medicinal power of the Yiyuan ancient spirit pill was continuously devoured and refined.</p><p>Before long, the medicinal effects of the pill were completely refined. Lu Ming felt that his cultivation level had increased by a level.</p><p>The medicinal power of a Yiyuan ancient spiritual pill was at least dozens of times that of a class 9 Lv 3 demonic pill.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>He gasped when he saw the huge black Lotus floating above Xie nianqing’s head.</p><p>This was obviously Xie nianqing’s bloodline. However, there were nine blood-red chakra Rings shining around the Black Lotus. It was a breathtaking sight.</p><p>A ninth-level bloodline. Xie nianqing’s bloodline had actually reached the ninth level. How terrifying.</p><p>Xie nianqing had not broken through to Grandmaster and awakened his second bloodline.</p><p>In other words, her first bloodline had reached level nine.</p><p>this little demoness ‘bloodline is terrifyingly high. No wonder her combat strength is so strong. She’s a true genius!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly. To be honest, this was the first time he had seen Xie nianqing’s bloodline.</p><p>her first bloodline has already reached Ordinary Level 9. I wonder what level her second bloodline will be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine the primordial spirit pill.</p><p>The surging energy was constantly transformed into essential Qi. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was improving rapidly.</p><p>Soon, the bottle of pills was refined and Lu Ming’s cultivation was approaching the middle ninth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Continue to refine the Gu</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had refined twelve bottles of pills in a row, and his cultivation had risen to the peak of the ninth grade great master realm.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had also reached the peak of ninth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>After reaching the peak of the ninth grade great Martial Master realm, one could start to take blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals to condense a second bloodline and accumulate energy for the awakening of the second bloodline.</p><p>This process was known as blood solidification, also known as half-Grandmaster.</p><p>During the blood solidification process, his blood Qi was exuberant and even stronger than a peak ninth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>A blood refining crystal appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand and she swallowed it. Immediately, her spine emitted a strong blood-red light.</p><p>Lu Ming did not waste any time. He also took out a blood refining crystal and swallowed it.</p><p>As soon as the blood refining crystal entered his mouth, it turned into blood Qi energy, which was absorbed by his spine and began to condense under the first bloodline.</p><p>A blood-red light began to appear in that place. As the blood Qi poured in, it slowly became brighter.</p><p>In a few breaths, the blood Qi of a blood refining crystal was completely absorbed. Lu Ming took out a few at once and swallowed them in one go.</p><p>The blood-red light on his spine grew larger and brighter.</p><p>Very soon, the dozens of blood refining crystals that Lu Ming had obtained were all used up.</p><p>Then, he made a grabbing motion in the air and a bunch of blood refinement pills appeared. He stuffed them into his mouth.</p><p>After a while, he grabbed another handful.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly realized that there was someone in front of him, and he couldn’t help but open his eyes.</p><p>He saw a pair of bright eyes staring at him in surprise.</p><p>It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“What are you doing, nest? I’m scared to death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and asked, ” “You have blood refinement pills? How many do you have left?”</p><p>“I do have blood refinement pills. How many are none of your business?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Can you give me some?”</p><p>Xie nianqing stammered, as if he found it difficult to speak.</p><p>“I won’t give it to you. I’ll give it to you so that you can break through and step on me in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming firmly rejected the idea.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think that I can’t step on you if you don’t give me the blood refinement pill?”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and gritted his teeth, revealing a few white teeth.</p><p>Then, he turned around and walked to the side.</p><p>However, in less than a minute, she came back and stared at Lu Ming with her big eyes.</p><p>“What do you want now?” Lu Ming asked, feeling speechless.</p><p>“I’ll buy it. I’ll buy the blood refinement pill from you, okay? How many crystals do you want? You can also use treasures to exchange for it. ”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Oh? Using treasures to exchange? That’s fine. How about this, I’ll tell you a few treasures, and if you have them, I’ll exchange them.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, go ahead!” Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Mysterious yang spirit, ten square bone banner”</p><p>Lu Ming listed five types of treasures in a row.</p><p>These five heavenly materials and earthly treasures were all required to cultivate the fifth stage of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xu and Xie nianqing both shook their heads, indicating that they didn’t.</p><p>if you don’t have it, how can you exchange it? How about this, give me some dragon essence or dragon essence, and I can exchange it with you!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>I don’t have dragon essence or dragon essence, but I do have a flood Dragon Bone bead. What do you think? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked hopefully.</p><p>“What? Flood Dragon Bone bead? You really have one? Why don’t you take it out and have a look?”</p><p>Lu Ming said anxiously.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s palm glowed, and the next moment, a fiery red bone bead the size of a baby’s fist appeared in his palm.</p><p>it’s really a water Dragon’s bone bead. And it’s a fire water Dragon’s bone bead!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Cultivating the true war Dragon technique didn’t necessarily require those materials. There were still some substitutes, but these substitutes were more precious.</p><p>For example, the items on the true Dragon’s body were all priceless treasures. Having just one of them would allow the true war Dragon technique to break through.</p><p>Although flood Dragons weren’t true dragons, they had the bloodline of true dragons and were extremely rare mutants. They also had some functions.</p><p>Lu Ming had only mentioned it casually. He did not expect Xie nianqing to really have such a treasure.</p><p>“Let me see!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the Water Dragon Bone bead and studied it carefully.</p><p>the flood Dragon that produced this bone bead has a very profound cultivation base. As long as I have this bone bead and another material, I can successfully break through to the fifth stage of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>“How is it? I’ll exchange it for 2000 blood refinement pills from you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Two thousand? You wish, you’re asking for too much.”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and shouted.</p><p>this is a water dragon Bone Pearl. I spent a lot of money to get it. 2000 blood refinement pills is not a lot.</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Five hundred!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? Aren’t you cutting too much? One thousand five hundred, no less. ”</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Eight hundred, no more.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips trembled.</p><p>“One thousand two hundred!”</p><p>“Nine hundred!”</p><p>…</p><p>one thousand, one thousand blood refinement pills. I can’t go any lower. If you go any lower, I won’t trade anymore.</p><p>Xie nianqing said viciously.</p><p>“Good! Deal!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed with a look of heartache.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
