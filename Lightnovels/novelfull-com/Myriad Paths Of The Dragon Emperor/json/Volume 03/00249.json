Even qiuming had been defeated. There were a few eighth grade great martial masters among them, but none of them were as strong as qiuming. Wouldn’t they be courting death if they went up?</p><p>damn it! When the geniuses on the silver ranking of the ten directions sword sect come, I’ll see how you die!</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School all had dark expressions as they roared in their hearts.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and swept his gaze across the entire arena. However, no one stepped forward to fight.</p><p>“Tianyun, since this is the case, my Ditian battle arena will send someone out for the battle.”</p><p>The judge said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. After a while, a young man full of killing intent stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>However, this person was not as strong as qiuming. He was defeated by Lu Ming after a few moves.</p><p>Four consecutive wins!</p><p>Following that, Di Tian battle arena sent another person to the arena, but he was still defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Five consecutive wins had already broken the record of the scorching sun’s five heroes.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s victory did not stop there. Following that, Di Tian battle arena continued to send people up. They were all strong death fighters, each stronger than the last. Unfortunately, they were all defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Six consecutive wins, seven consecutive wins.</p><p>He tied with Qiu changkong’s record, but not long after, Lu Ming won again.</p><p>Eight consecutive wins!</p><p>The crowd burst into an uproar. Qiu changkong’s record had finally been broken.</p><p>my God, tianyun is going to defy the heavens. Could it be that his talent is even greater than Qiu changkong’s? ”</p><p>not necessarily. Qiu changkong was strong when he was a martial Grandmaster, but he wasn’t much stronger than the other five heroes. Qiu changkong was only able to surpass the other five heroes because he had awakened his second bloodline when he broke through to the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>that’s right. Although tianyun is strong now, he might not be able to reach the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“That’s true, but it’s still quite terrifying. Furthermore, what’s tianyun’s limit? How many consecutive wins will he be able to achieve in the end?”</p><p>The crowd speculated in shock. Tianyun couldn’t have crossed two levels and obtained ten consecutive victories, right?</p><p>The facts proved that their guess was coming true.</p><p>In the ninth battle, Di Tian battle arena sent out a powerful expert who was stronger than qiuming. However, he was still not a match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Nine consecutive wins!</p><p>This made the elders of the DI Tian battle arena’s higher-ups somewhat stunned.</p><p>“This little fellow’s strength isn’t bad. In the future, he might even be able to join the Empyrean sky divine guards. We have to pay close attention to it. The contribution of the recommendation will not be small.”</p><p>“It’s still too early to join the Ditian divine guards. Let’s see how his martial ancestor’s second bloodline is awakened. Now, the most urgent thing is to stop his winning streak. Otherwise, we old guys will suffer a loss.”</p><p>A few old men were discussing, frowning.</p><p>let No. 10 go. He’s the only one who got into the top 10 with his eighth grade great Martial Master cultivation. If he’s defeated, we can’t do anything.</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>The order was quickly given, and a topless young man in his twenties walked up to the fighting ring.</p><p>On his face, there was a number 10.</p><p>No. 10? how could it be No. 10? ”</p><p>A few people who knew the inside story of the DI Tian battle arena cried out in surprise.</p><p>The death fighters of Ditian battle arena, number one to ten, were usually the top experts among the ninth grade great martial masters.</p><p>But now, No. 10 was an eighth grade great Martial Master. Many people understood that this No. 10 must be extraordinary.</p><p>“He’s an expert, that’s what makes it interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. This No. 10 did not give off a strong aura, but Lu Ming could vaguely sense that he was dangerous.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>No. 10 suddenly let out a loud roar and a long spear appeared in his hand. In an instant, he shot out dozens of spear rays, which pierced through the air toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“He actually uses a spear too, just nice!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled and let out a buzzing sound. Rays of spear light burst out and clashed with No. 10.</p><p>On the 200-meter wide fighting ring, two shadows crossed each other. The Spear’s radiance whistled and exploded. The rumbling sounds were endless. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>At the same time, there were three types of Shi that were constantly bombarding and resisting each other.</p><p>“This little fellow called tianyun is truly astonishing. At such a young age, he’s already comprehended two types of force, and he’s already at the initial success stage in both. His Fire Force in particular is approaching the major success stage.”</p><p>that’s right. Number Ten’s ‘Mountain Force’ is also close to completion, and it’s about the same as tianyun’s ‘Fire Force’. However, tianyun’s Wind and Fire combination is even more powerful. If it wasn’t for the fact that number Ten’s cultivation base is much higher than tianyun’s, he would have already lost.</p><p>“In my opinion, defeat is only a matter of time!”</p><p>The higher-ups of the fighting arena were discussing as they watched.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged more than a hundred moves with No. 10.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright. The more he fought, the braver he became. The power of wind and Fire gathered on the demon subduing spear, forming a shocking destructive power.</p><p>In this battle, other than the earth level martial arts technique and blood Meridian that did not erupt, Lu Ming had used all his strength.</p><p>The current Lu Ming was extremely powerful. He had reached the fourth stage of the true war Dragon technique and a perfect third-grade physical body. With the convergence of the power of wind and Fire, an ordinary ninth grade great Martial Master would not be able to take more than a few of his moves.</p><p>From this, one could see how powerful No. 10 was.</p><p>The audience of over 300000 held their breath and stared at the fighting ring, afraid to miss the most important scene.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another hundred moves had passed. Lu Ming’s courage mounted as the battle progressed and he gradually gained the upper hand.</p><p>A shocking killing intent erupted from number Ten’s body. He was like a wild beast, unafraid of death. However, he was still suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After another hundred moves, No. 10 was sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear. He slid a few hundred meters away and fell off the fighting ring.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>No. 10 growled. He wanted to rush up the fighting ring, regardless of his injuries.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>stop! the judge shouted in a low voice. Ten’s body trembled and he stopped in his tracks. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“This round, tianyun wins!”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The audience in the stadium let out a long breath. They had been too nervous just now. Many people had been holding their breath until their faces were red. Now, they could finally let out a long breath.</p><p>Then, there was a shocking uproar.</p><p>Over 300,000 people began to discuss excitedly.</p><p>crossing two levels and winning ten times in a row … That’s too terrifying. It hasn’t happened in the burning sun Empire for at least five hundred years.</p><p>miracle, what a miracle! After today, tianyun’s name shall be known throughout the world!</p><p>if tianyun were to mature, he would be comparable to the six heroes, or even stronger!</p><p>“I’m witnessing the birth of a miracle.”</p><p>In the crowd, the three Ming siblings were so excited that they were trembling, while the people from the ten direction Sword School were all pale and bloodless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to continue the challenge?”</p><p>Then, everyone thought of the same question.</p><p>He could fight a battle that was three levels above him.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn’t just a simple jump of three levels, and he wouldn’t be facing an ordinary ninth grade great Martial Master. He was definitely an expert, and he was definitely stronger than No. 10.</p><p>Would tianyun continue?</p><p>Countless people were looking forward to it.</p><p>“This little guy won’t really continue, will he?”</p><p>A few elders among the higher-ups bitterly smiled.</p><p>If Lu Ming continued to fight, they would be at a loss.</p><p>“Tianyun, do you still wish to continue the challenge?”</p><p>The judge looked at Lu Ming, but there was a trace of nervousness and speechlessness in his eyes.</p><p>He had the same thought as the other elders.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
