He was a Supreme expert who had dominated the world, but he had ended up like this. It was a pity.</p><p>ten years, ten years!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>It was almost impossible to grow to the point where he could compete with Martial Emperor Di Yi in ten years. The difference was too great.</p><p>His cultivation was only at the ninth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Above the martial Grandmaster realm were the martial ancestor realm, the martial King realm, and the spiritual God Realm. Above the three spiritual God realms was the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>There was a difference of six major realms.</p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p>no matter how difficult it is, I have to try my best. If I don’t try, How do I know it won’t work? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>Then, he looked at Xie nianqing who was still unconscious.</p><p>we can’t let anyone else know about the nine suns Supreme. Who knows if Martial Emperor Di Yi will notice? let’s leave this place first.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Then, he walked over and pulled Xie nianqing along. With a thought, they disappeared from the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon’s roar shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>As soon as they left the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming realized that they were not in the blood demon’s stomach but on its back.</p><p>The blood demon felt that there were two more people on his back. He immediately flew into a rage and roared repeatedly.</p><p>The blood Qi surged and swept towards Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Demon suppressing token!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the demon suppressing token appeared. It floated in the air automatically. An invisible wave was emitted and surged toward the blood demon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon roared, as if it was extremely frightened. It let out a low wail and finally knelt down.</p><p>Submissive!</p><p>Lu Ming was pleasantly surprised. At the same time, he was amazed by the nine suns cosmos ‘methods.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme was just a wisp of soul. He was already at the end of his life when he helped him seal the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Under such circumstances, he could make the blood demon submit to him by simply condensing a demon suppressing token. The power of his means was already incredible.</p><p>“Let’s continue forward!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted the blood demon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon growled, got up, and continued to run forward.</p><p>The blood demon was obviously the Overlord of this area. With him leading the way, this area was unimpeded.</p><p>“Aiya, am I dead?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing shouted and jumped up from the blood demon’s back. His big black eyes looked around.</p><p>The next moment, he saw Lu Ming and could not help but call out, ” “Lu Ming, you’re dead too? We’re in the netherworld? It’s all your fault, but I still have an unfulfilled wish.”</p><p>Xie nianqing closed his eyes and sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He was stunned for a while before he said, ” “Who said I’m dead? I’m still alive and well.”</p><p>“You didn’t die? Then why are you with me? I know, did you capture my soul? what do you want to do? You won’t even let go of my soul, you despicable, shameless, perverted pervert.”</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing heard that Lu Ming was not dead, he began to curse and his body kept shrinking back.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was completely dumbfounded. He stared at Xie nianqing in a daze.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened as he looked at Lu Ming warily. After a while, he realized that something was wrong. He looked around and shouted, ” “So, I’m not dead either. Not good! How are we going to get on the blood Devil’s back? let’s think of a way to get out of this place!”</p><p>“Escape? If you want to run, run!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat there calmly, looking calm and relaxed.</p><p>“You’re not running?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned and he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>“Of course not. With this blood devil leading the way, what’s the point of running?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Blood devil leading the way? Wait, what’s going on? Why isn’t the blood devil attacking us?”</p><p>Xie nianqing noticed that the blood demon had been moving obediently, unlike the previous time when it would pounce on them.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve already subdued it.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Subdued by you? how is that possible? You think you can subdue this blood devil?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked a series of questions. She would never believe him.</p><p>This blood demon was extremely ferocious and powerful. She estimated that even if it had not reached the level of a martial King, it was not far from it. Could Lu Ming subdue it?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>But the next moment, her beautiful eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>Lu Ming said lightly, ” “Little blood, stop!”</p><p>Then, the blood demon stopped and growled in a low voice, seemingly trying to please Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little blood, get down!”</p><p>With another light sentence, blood devil obediently lay down.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were about to pop out, and his mouth was so wide open that a duck egg could be stuffed in.</p><p>Her beautiful face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>The blood demon had actually been subdued by Lu Ming. Moreover, it was the kind that was obedient.</p><p>Most importantly, what did Lu Ming call the blood demon? Little blood?</p><p>Xie nianqing felt like he was in a mess.</p><p>“Hahaha, what do you think? Don’t you admire me? do you have the urge to repay me with your body?”</p><p>Seeing Xie nianqing’s expression, Lu Ming felt extremely pleased. He laughed heartily with a smug expression on his face.</p><p>His smile was so wide that it almost reached his ears.</p><p>“Promise your head! Humph! Who knows what kind of despicable method you used to subdue this blood devil? Humph! You are a despicable bastard! One day, I will step on you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted coldly and glared at Lu Ming a few times. Then, he turned around and did not look at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, she was still shocked and curious about Lu Ming. She did not know what method Lu Ming had used to subdue the blood demon.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He knew Xie nianqing’s temper and could not be bothered to argue with her.</p><p>Then, the blood demon continued on its way. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing sat cross-legged on the blood demon’s back, channeling and healing their injuries.</p><p>About half a day later, the scenery in front of them changed.</p><p>In front of them, a huge, semi-circular light screen enveloped them. Lu Ming and the rest were inside this semi-circular light screen.</p><p>It was a huge inscription formation.</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming found out that the blood Realm and Devil’s Den was in a huge inscription array.</p><p>No wonder he couldn’t tell the direction the moment he entered the formation.</p><p>The only difference was that there was a stone door here.</p><p>The stone door was huge and was tightly shut, embedded in the light screen.</p><p>“This stone door might be the exit!”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>He ordered blood demon to charge forward.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, two earth-shaking roars came from the huge stone door. The stone door glowed, and two huge strange beasts appeared in front of the stone door.</p><p>These two strange beasts were incomparably huge, and their entire bodies emitted a blood-red radiance.</p><p>The moment it appeared, it glared at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he immediately shouted,”Little blood, destroy them!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood demon let out a furious roar and rushed toward the two strange beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing jumped down from the blood demon.</p><p>Immediately, the three humongous creatures began to fight each other.</p><p>The blood Qi was boiling, and the battle was extremely intense. The two strange beasts were also extremely powerful, but unfortunately, they were still inferior to the blood demon.</p><p>Soon, the two beasts were torn apart by the blood demon and swallowed in a few bites.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
