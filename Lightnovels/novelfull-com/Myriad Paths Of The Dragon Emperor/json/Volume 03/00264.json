He wanted to cut off Lu Ming’s head with one strike.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and stabbed again. A bright spear gleam pierced forward.</p><p>The spear radiance and the middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster’s sword clashed. The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster’s expression changed drastically in an instant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A wave of extremely sharp and powerful force blasted towards the middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster. The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly. He slid back for dozens of meters in the forest, leaving a deep gully on the ground.</p><p>how can a great Martial Master have such powerful strength? ”</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster roared in his heart.</p><p>“So this is your strength, it’s not that great, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his gun and charged at the other party.</p><p>The long spear thrust out and beams of dazzling spear radiance burst out.</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster tried his best, but he was still no match.</p><p>After six moves, he was hit by Lu Ming’s spear and flew out with a scream.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming chased after him and smashed his long spear down from above.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster screamed again. His body was smashed into the ground, creating a huge pit. He lay in the pit and kept spitting out blood. He could not move.</p><p>In a flash, Xie nianqing appeared beside him. It was clear that she had already taken care of the five ninth grade great Martial Master realm Warriors.</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster lay in the crater and looked at the two young people with shock in his eyes.</p><p>Where did this young man pop out from? he was too terrifying, and his combat strength was simply shocking.</p><p>could he be a genius from the blood Zhao Empire? ”</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong thought.</p><p>He had never heard of such a powerful great Martial Master in the blazing sun Empire. Unless it was a mid-tier Empire like the blood Zhao Empire, it would be normal to have such a genius.</p><p>“Tell me, what’s the current situation of the person you’re chasing? Where are they?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster coldly and asked.</p><p>“Could it be that you are also after the secret key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure? I’m telling you, Qiu changkong of the ten direction sword sect is right in front of us. You’re just a mere great Martial Master, and you want to interfere? you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong shouted angrily.</p><p>“The secret key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure? Qiu changkong is also in front?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He looked a little solemn and doubtful.</p><p>The leader of the six heroes, Qiu changkong, was actually hunting down his father.</p><p>And the secret key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure? “Is it related to a Martial Emperor?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Above the martial ancestor realm was the martial King realm. They were known as Kings and were extremely powerful.</p><p>It was still a question whether or not there was a martial King in the vast blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Even the overlords like Lin Xueyi had not reached the martial King realm.</p><p>However, there was a huge difference between a martial King and a Martial Emperor. No, there was an even greater difference. There was no way to compare.</p><p>After the martial King realm, there were still three major realms of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Above the three spiritual God realms was the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>A Martial Emperor could shatter the heavens and earth with a snap of their fingers, causing the sun and moon to lose their light. They were the strongest experts in the divine wilderness continent, unrivaled at the peak.</p><p>As for whether there was a higher realm after the Martial Emperor realm, there were legends, but they were just legends.</p><p>Could the secret key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure be related to the Martial Emperor?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but be shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming did not notice that Xie nianqing’s eyes glowed with surprise when he heard the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>“So I advise you to let me go quickly. I can hide what happened today. Otherwise, you will all end up in a miserable state.”</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong threatened.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, he let out a shrill scream because Lu Ming had pierced his thigh with a spear.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense. Tell me, where did you chase them to? did you find the person you’re chasing?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong broke out in cold sweat and screamed, ” “I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you, please don’t kill me!”</p><p>He knew that he had met a ruthless person today, so he could only admit defeat and beg for mercy.</p><p>“Speak!” Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“If we keep going forward from here, it’s the experts of the Dark Moon Empire who have kidnapped the people we’re pursuing. Our people are about to catch up with them.”</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong shouted.</p><p>“The Dark Moon Empire?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, feeling that the situation was getting more and more complicated. He continued to ask, ” “How many experts did you bring this time?”</p><p>other than Qiu changkong, there are a total of seven people in the martial ancestor realm. Now, other than me, there are six more people and more than a hundred martial artists in the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster answered honestly.</p><p>I’ve said everything I need to say. I beg you to let me go. I won’t tell anyone about what happened today.</p><p>The middle-aged Wu Zong begged.</p><p>However, there was a Flash of Ferocity in the depths of his eyes. He secretly planned that as long as Lu Ming let him go, he would inform Qiu changkong and let them die without a burial.</p><p>“Let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. With a flash of killing intent, he thrust his spear forward.</p><p>“Don’t be scared!”</p><p>The middle-aged martial arts Grandmaster screamed. However, the next moment, his scream came to an abrupt end because his heart had been pierced and crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“I won’t leave behind any hidden dangers!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength is not bad. I’m looking forward to stepping on you even more!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sized Lu Ming up carefully, his eyes glowing with passion.</p><p>Lu Ming shivered and quickly changed the topic. “You don’t want the spoils of war, but I want them.”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming fumbled around the bodies of the people from the omnidirectional sword sect. At the same time, he controlled his spirit-devouring bloodline and secretly devoured their blood essence.</p><p>There was the blood essence of a first level martial arts Grandmaster here. Lu Ming did not want to miss it.</p><p>After the battle just now, Lu Ming had a better understanding of his combat strength.</p><p>It was equivalent to the peak of the first level of the martial ancestor realm. The middle-aged man was only in the early stage of the first level.</p><p>Therefore, he was defeated by Lu Ming in a few moves due to his carelessness.</p><p>However, such combat power was far from enough.</p><p>Qiu changkong was the leader of the six heroes. His combat strength was definitely terrifying, not to mention that there were other martial grandmasters present.</p><p>It would be very difficult to save his father.</p><p>He had to constantly improve his strength.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming had devoured all the blood essences of the eight disciples of the omnidirectional Sword School.</p><p>Eight more storage rings appeared in his hands.</p><p>hey, you can’t keep the storage ring for yourself. I want the storage ring of that martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted.</p><p>“On what basis?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give it to her.</p><p>“No, I’m definitely taking it.”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth.</p><p>alright, but I’m going to cultivate for a while. Help me guard!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You can f * ck me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and finally agreed.</p><p>The two of them left the place and stopped in a Valley more than fifty miles away.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to refine his blood essence and break through to the ninth grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted coldly and stood guard at the entrance of the valley unwillingly.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The blood essence of a first level martial arts Grandmaster was too rich. It was constantly being converted into thick energy. Lu Ming refined it and converted it into essential Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming began to break through to the next realm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
