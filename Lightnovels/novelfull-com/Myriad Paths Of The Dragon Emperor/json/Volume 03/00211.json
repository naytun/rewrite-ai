If he said he would defeat bai chi in 30 moves, then he really meant it.</p><p>It was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“Baichi, is this your true strength? You’re really disappointing. From now on, you’ll be removed from the top ten experts, and your ranking will be inherited by me!”</p><p>Ming Cheng shouted.</p><p>Bai chi gritted his teeth, his face ashen, but he could not refute.</p><p>He was originally ranked tenth in the top ten experts. Now that he was defeated, he naturally should withdraw from the top ten experts ‘ranking and be replaced by Ming Cheng.</p><p>also, you don’t have the right to stay in this courtyard anymore. I’ll give you three days to move out.</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>“What? Don’t you go too far!”</p><p>Baichi roared.</p><p>“Bullying? Why didn’t you think that way when you hit my brother? You just think that you’re strong enough to bully others, but now that I’m stronger than you, what’s wrong with that?”</p><p>Ming Cheng was very domineering and sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Bai chi was furious, but he had nothing to say.</p><p>“Haha, second sister, little brother, let’s go!”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed and turned to leave.</p><p>“Hmph, why aren’t you cocky now? You’re just a piece of trash!”</p><p>Ming Feng pouted and looked at bai chi and Bai Long with disdain.</p><p>Bai chi and Bai Long were so angry that their eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>The three Ming siblings passed through the crowd. The people around them gloated at bai Chi’s misfortune when they saw him in such a sorry state.</p><p>The Bai brothers had offended many people.</p><p>“What are you looking at? If you keep looking, I’ll dig out your eyes!”</p><p>Bai Long roared as he scanned the crowd.</p><p>The surrounding crowd couldn’t help but lower their heads, but their hearts were filled with disdain. Why weren’t they arrogant in front of Ming Cheng just now? now that Ming Cheng had left, they began to be arrogant.</p><p>Bai Long’s gaze swept across the entire scene. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and a ferocious look appeared on his face. He pointed in Lu Ming’s direction and shouted,”It’s you, you little bastard. It’s all your fault. Big brother, the one who injured me that day was this bastard!”</p><p>Bai Long pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>The people around Lu Ming were shocked. They hurriedly took a few steps back to distance themselves from Lu Ming.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming was exposed.</p><p>“Is this the kid?”</p><p>Bai Chi’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, at this moment, his killing intent towards Lu Ming was extremely strong.</p><p>He felt that the reason why he ended up in this state, being defeated by Ming Cheng in public and being humiliated ruthlessly was all because of Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not injured Bai Long, he would not have gone to the earth Aeon cave to cause trouble for Lu Ming. He would not have injured Ming peak and attracted Ming city here.</p><p>At this moment, he blamed everything on Lu Ming. His desire to kill Lu Ming was stronger than Ming Cheng.</p><p>“Damn it, this brat should die!”</p><p>Baichi roared.</p><p>“Senior Bai, we’ve brought you the kid you wanted.”</p><p>At this time, Liu Pozi squeezed out of the crowd and walked toward bai chi.</p><p>little bastard, come here, kneel down, kowtow to me a hundred times in front of everyone, and admit your mistake. Hurry up!</p><p>Baichi pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>He wanted to get back at Lu Ming for the humiliation he had suffered today. He also wanted to let others know that he, bai chi, was still a strong person, a strong person that everyone respected.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips suddenly curled into a cold smile. How could he not see through bai Chi’s thoughts?</p><p>He was treating him as a soft persimmon.</p><p>However, was Lu Ming a pushover?</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward casually and looked at Bai Long.”What’s wrong? Wasn’t it enough to be taught a lesson back then? now you want to be abused again?”</p><p>A sinister expression appeared on Bai Long’s face, and he said,”Kid, what you did to me, I will take it back ten times!”</p><p>“Ten times? With just you, or with you, the Big Brother who was easily defeated just now?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and cast a glance at bai chi.</p><p>In an instant, bai Chi’s expression changed. It became extremely ugly. The muscles on his face trembled and his eyes revealed an extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>He regarded the matter earlier as a great humiliation, but Lu Ming still brought it up now? This was the scar of receiving him in public.</p><p>Gasps could be heard from the crowd.</p><p>‘Lu Ming is too bold. How dare he say that to bai chi in public? it’s over.’ Everyone thought.’Lu Ming is finished. Bai chi will never let him off.’</p><p>As expected, bai Chi’s expression was ferocious. He looked at Lu Ming and said in a cold voice, ” “Little bastard, if I don’t break all the bones in your body today, I won’t be called Baichi.”</p><p>“Just call me an idiot, it’s easy to say, isn’t it? It’s also a good match for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Ah, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Bai chi could not hold it in any longer. He roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“White Snake dragon palm!”</p><p>Baichi used his ultimate move as soon as he attacked.</p><p>A huge white Dragon roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>A sharp aura gushed out and filled the entire area.</p><p>Many people felt the terrifying pressure and retreated with a change in expression.</p><p>Although bai chi had been defeated by Ming Cheng, he was not seriously injured. His strength had not weakened, and he was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They all knew that the reason bai chi was easily defeated by Ming Cheng was not because bai chi was weak, but because Ming Cheng was too strong.</p><p>“That brat wouldn’t be turned into a meat pie with a single palm strike, right?”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, Lu Ming’s hand glowed and a long spear was condensed. He swept the spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear swept across the White Dragon, directly shattering it into pieces.</p><p>Bai chi let out a muffled groan and his expression changed drastically. He quickly retreated more than ten steps before he could stabilize his body.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded, their eyes wide as they watched this scene.</p><p>He retreated. The White Scarlet residence retreated after Lu Ming’s one move.</p><p>How was this possible? Some of them even rubbed their eyes hard, thinking that they had seen wrong.</p><p>what Dragon Transformation palm? I think it’s more like insect transformation palm!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … Take my move!”</p><p>Bai chi was so angry that he almost vomited blood. He roared and continued to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>White Snake dragon palm, one palm turning into ten Dragons!</p><p>Baichi’s palms were sent out continuously, using the strongest move he had used in the fierce battle with Ming Cheng.</p><p>“I’ll defeat you in three moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and with a move of his hand, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and the demon subduing spear turned into ten spear shadows. It was so fast that it was as if ten bolts of lightning had appeared in the sky.</p><p>After that, there were ten loud Explosions in the Sky. The ten white giant Dragons that bai chi had blasted out were all defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is the first move. Next, the second move!”</p><p>Before the crowd could be shocked, Lu Ming immediately executed his second move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The pitch-black demon subduing spear pierced through the air and instantly stabbed toward bai chi.</p><p>so fast! It’s too fast!</p><p>Bai chi shouted in fear. He used all of his strength and struck out dozens of palm strikes in an instant. The terrifying power covered the area in front of him.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
