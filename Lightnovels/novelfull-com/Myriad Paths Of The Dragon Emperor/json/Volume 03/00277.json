On the side of the shelves, there were a few dried corpses. It was obvious that they had been killed and their blood had been extracted to form blood refining crystals.</p><p>It was obvious that everything here had been looted by the people who had rushed in first.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry up and go! Get lost!”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The scene was in chaos. Everyone wanted to rush up, so it was naturally chaotic. Seven or eight people were fighting.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>A young man wielding a battleaxe swung his axe at Lu Ming.</p><p>His cultivation of the first level of the martial ancestor realm was revealed.</p><p>“You really think I’m a pushover?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He struck out a palm, and a huge palm print blasted toward the young man.</p><p>Bang! The young man’s bones were broken, and he was thrown back, but he didn’t die, because he also cultivated an earth level martial skill, which blocked part of the power of the palm of humanity.</p><p>Even so, the other young powerhouses were shocked and looked at Lu Ming with fear.</p><p>where did such a powerful great Martial Master come from? I’ve seen all the strongest great martial masters in the blood Zhao Empire, but there’s no such person.</p><p>Someone said with a grave expression.</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with them. He rushed to the third level with Xie nianqing.</p><p>The third floor also had a few shelves, and the items on the shelves had also been ransacked.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not stop at all. They continued to rush up.</p><p>The fourth level, the fifth level, the sixth level …</p><p>All the way to the sixth floor, the two of them were always a step slower than the others and were completely robbed.</p><p>When he reached the sixth level, he heard the sound of intense fighting. The sound came from the seventh level.</p><p>The two of them charged forward without hesitation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the seventh floor, there were six youths engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>One of them was the youth in the brocade robe. This person’s cultivation was at the second level of the martial ancestor realm and he was definitely a genius.</p><p>As for the other five, they were all at the peak of the 1-dan martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense. The six of them were in a chaotic mess, but it was obvious that the youth in the brocade robe had the advantage.</p><p>On the seventh floor, there were only two shelves with some Jade bottles on them.</p><p>On the shelf, it was written,”Yiyuan ancient panaceas, medium Lv 4 elixir.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Then, his eyes emitted a shocking glow.</p><p>The Yiyuan ancient spiritual pill was a medium Lv 4 pill. It could increase one’s cultivation very quickly. For a martial arts Grandmaster, it was very useful.</p><p>In the outside world, the price of the Yiyuan ancient panaceas was astonishingly high, and there was often a demand but no supply.</p><p>I must get some. This way, my cultivation will reach the peak of the ninth grade Grandmaster realm in a short time. Then, I’ll consume the blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals to refine my bloodline and break through to the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>In this place, Lu Ming had no time to devour the blood essence of others. The blood essence of the Warriors who died in battle had all been condensed into blood refining crystals. Without devouring the blood essence, Lu Ming’s cultivation level could not be improved in a short time.</p><p>The Yiyuan ancient spiritual pill appeared at the right time.</p><p>“You guys want to fight with me? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man in the brocade robe shouted. His eyes were like lightning, and his body emitted a strong purple light. He struck out with his palm, and it was a purple palm print. It was extremely powerful, and the other young men all retreated.</p><p>“Zisong, there are so many people here. How is it possible for you to take the Yiyuan ancient panaceas for yourself?”</p><p>Another young man called out.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then I’ll kill you first. Extreme Purple Golden Dragon palm!”</p><p>Zi song let out a long roar. The purple light on his body was extremely dense. When it reached a certain level, the purple light actually turned into gold. He struck out a palm and a golden true dragon roared out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man was knocked away by the Golden Dragon. He coughed out a mouthful of blood and his aura was extremely weak. His eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>“Is it possible now?”</p><p>Zi song looked at the young man coldly, then looked at the others.</p><p>The other four young men’s expressions changed.</p><p>“Hurry up and get lost. If you don’t, you’ll end up like him.”</p><p>Zi song’s aura was overbearing as he coldly looked at the others.</p><p>Zisong, there are four of us. We might not be afraid of you even if we work together.</p><p>A tall young man said unwillingly.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, he had completely ignored them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the tall youth finished speaking, Zi song struck out a palm and a Golden Dragon rushed out.</p><p>With a scream, the young man was torn in half by the Golden Dragon.</p><p>His blood essence and blood were condensed into 16 blood refining crystals, which were put away by Zi song.</p><p>“You still want to join forces? This is the end.”</p><p>Zi song sneered.</p><p>The remaining three people were extremely shocked. Zi song was too powerful. They were no match for him when he used his ultimate move.</p><p>They looked at each other and finally retreated from the sixth floor unwillingly.</p><p>“Aren’t you two going to get lost?”</p><p>Zi song looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Get lost? Get lost and let me see.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Instantly, Zi song’s face darkened and he said, ” “Kid, do you know the consequences of your words? Now, even if you want to leave, you can’t. Two mere great martial masters want to get their hands on the Yiyuan ancient panaceas? you’re really delusional and don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”</p><p>Zi song looked down at Lu Ming from above and walked toward him.</p><p>“Brat, do you want to kill yourself or do you want me to do it? if I do it, you won’t die so easily. Also, little girl, if you swear to be my concubine and serve me well for the rest of your life, I’ll let you go.”</p><p>Zi song looked at Xie nianqing with a burning gaze.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s looks were indeed rare in the world. Any man who saw him would be moved.</p><p>“Do you think trash like you is worthy?”</p><p>Xie nianqing sneered.</p><p>“Since you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, then I’ll send you both on your way together.”</p><p>Zi song’s body burst out with cold killing intent and he slapped his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>A purple palm print surged over.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he also struck out with his palm.</p><p>The human Dao palm was formed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two palm prints collided with a loud boom. Lu Ming’s figure swayed slightly, while Zi song took three steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>At this moment, his face revealed a look of disbelief. A mere ninth grade great Martial Master could actually push him back with one palm. How was this possible?</p><p>Then, an extremely cold killing intent burst out. He roared, ” “Damn it, damn it, go to hell!”</p><p>The purple light on Zi song’s body was extremely dense. Then, it turned golden. He struck out with his palm and a golden true dragon pounced out.</p><p>The Golden true Dragon’s body was fused with a powerful Shi.</p><p>Zi song’s Shi was also very strong and had reached the small success stage.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
