Time-type inscription?” Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The inscription of time was a Supreme inscription, and it was extremely difficult to master.</p><p>“According to this old man’s guess, this place has an age limit. If you exceed a certain age, you will be killed by the inscription formation in the vortex.”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Then how many years can it take to enter and how many years can it not?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>the world is divided by the age of 30. Those under 30 are the younger generation, which is the golden age for cultivation. Therefore, I speculate that those under 30 can enter this place, and those above 30 can’t.</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Thirty years old? I’ve already surpassed it. ”</p><p>“I’m just 31 years old. How unlucky.”</p><p>Many of those who were over 30 years old had a dejected look on their faces and cried out their bad luck. As for those who were below 30 years old, they revealed a look of joy. The stronger their cultivation base, the happier they were.</p><p>Since the older generation could not enter, those with higher cultivation would naturally have the advantage. How could they not be happy?</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Immediately, some young men under the age of 30 rushed forward.</p><p>As expected, they were fine and disappeared into the vortex one by one.</p><p>“Hahaha, ants like you also want to compete with me!”</p><p>Yang Liuji laughed arrogantly.</p><p>He was the only genius on the cloud Emperor ranking list who came here. Who could compete with him?</p><p>He stepped into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>The other young men also rushed in like bees.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that there were at least thousands of people.</p><p>During this period, there were also those over 30 who didn’t believe in luck and wanted to take a risk, but they were all killed by the inscription formation.</p><p>After that, no one else above the age of 30 dared to try again.</p><p>“Let’s go in as well.”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and charged into the vortex with Lu Ming.</p><p>As he rushed into the vortex, he felt his head spin. The next moment, Lu Ming found himself standing at the foot of a mountain. In front of him was a vast mountain.</p><p>Xie nianqing was right beside him. Not only that, but everyone seemed to have gathered at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>At a glance, it was full of people.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, not far from Lu Ming. A great battle broke out.</p><p>The people who had entered this place came from various forces. Some people already had enmity with each other, so it was very normal for a battle to break out when they met.</p><p>A moment later, a young man was killed with a scream.</p><p>However, at this moment, a change occurred.</p><p>Inscriptions suddenly appeared in the sky and wrapped around the young man who had been killed. The next moment, a shocking scene appeared. The blood and essence of the young man’s body were all extracted. Under the effect of the inscriptions, it turned into a blood-red crystal and fell to the ground.</p><p>“This … Are these blood refining crystals?”</p><p>it’s blood refining crystals. It’s true. I have them on me.</p><p>“What? It’s unbelievable that a dead person would be refined into a blood refining crystal.”</p><p>The entire place burst into an earth-shattering uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>The blood refining crystal and the blood refining pill had similar effects. They were both used by Warriors to awaken their second bloodline.</p><p>The effect of a blood refinement crystal was similar to a blood refinement pill.</p><p>“We’ll know once we try.”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout rang out.</p><p>A sun appeared in the crowd and exploded.</p><p>Miserable screams rang out continuously as more than a dozen people were killed.</p><p>The next moment, a large number of runes appeared in the sky and wrapped around the corpses. Then, the blood of the corpses was extracted and refined into blood refining crystals.</p><p>It really was so!</p><p>Many people gasped, and many people had bloodthirsty looks in their eyes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Immediately, someone roared and charged at the people around him.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>There were also people who shouted as they madly rushed towards the vast mountains.</p><p>The scene was in chaos, and the smell of blood filled the air.</p><p>Dense runes appeared in the sky, and the blood of those who were killed all turned into blood refining crystals.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were also people who charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swept out his long spear and clashed with the other party. The other party was forced back.</p><p>Xie nianqing, let’s go. We’ll rush into those mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>There were too many geniuses who had entered this time. Most of them were young experts from the blood Zhao Empire. There were many young experts in the martial ancestor realm. With Lu Ming’s combat strength, he could only be ranked in the middle and had to retreat for the time being.</p><p>The two of them rushed towards the vast mountain with all their might. Not long after, they rushed into the mountain and continued to run towards the depths of the mountain.</p><p>Behind them, there were people continuously rushing into the mountain.</p><p>Thousands of people were scattered in the vast mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing ran for more than two hundred miles before they stopped.</p><p>“For the next period of time, this place will become a hell of slaughter.”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>One could imagine how crazy it was to turn someone’s life into blood refining crystals. The youths who entered would definitely hunt each other down.</p><p>Although the young martial ancestor realm experts did not have any use for blood refining crystals, they could still sell them for a shocking price.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we have to break through to the martial ancestor realm as soon as possible. Otherwise, we’ll be in a very passive position.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>In this unfamiliar environment, they were facing strong enemies everywhere. The relationship between the two of them had unknowingly become closer.</p><p>that’s right, but it’s not easy to make a breakthrough. Let’s look around and see if there are any treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The two of them randomly chose a direction and ran forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp air-piercing sound was heard, and several sword Qi flew toward the two of them.</p><p>There was a sneak attack!</p><p>Their expressions changed and they dodged the attack.</p><p>Then, with a flash, eight figures appeared and surrounded the two.</p><p>“You two are unlucky. Now, turn into our blood refining crystals.”</p><p>The leader of the eight people, a young man, coldly said.</p><p>This person was the strongest among the eight. The aura on his body was extremely thick, and he was an expert in the first realm of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The other seven were all ninth grade great martial masters.</p><p>sixth senior brother, this woman is extremely beautiful. It’s such a pity to kill her just like this. Why don’t you let me play with her first before killing her? ”</p><p>One of them was a short and chubby young man. He looked at Xie nianqing with a perverted look in his eyes. His crotch was bulging.</p><p>“Fatso Liu, put away your perverted thoughts. What kind of place is this? let’s end this quickly, or else we won’t even know how we died.”</p><p>The sixth brother scolded.</p><p>The chunky young man laughed a few times, but when he looked at Xie nianqing, the fire in his eyes grew stronger. He didn’t notice the killing intent in Xie nianqing’s eyes.</p><p>“This fellow is really pitiful.”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. In his heart, he was already mourning for this fatty.</p><p>He even dared to molest the little devil, Xie nianqing. He was really looking for death.</p><p>“You’re dead.”</p><p>As expected, Xie nianqing’s voice was cold.</p><p>“What? I’m dead? You want to kill me? haha, what a joke. Didn’t you see that my sixth senior brother is a martial Grandmaster powerhouse? you are just a great Martial Master. You want to kill me in front of a martial Grandmaster? what a joke … “Ah!” “Ah!” My precious …”</p><p>The chunky young man started to be arrogant, but before he could finish his words, he let out a shrill scream.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
