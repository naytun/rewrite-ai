Senior brother yang Zaitian was killed by tianyun!</p><p>The disciple pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Other than the young men who had entered the blood ant secret realm, everyone turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Yang Zaitian was actually killed by tianyun? How was this possible?</p><p>Was tianyun that powerful?</p><p>Even the red-haired elder, Hua Chi, and company were shocked.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s body emitted a cold killing intent. He turned around and glared at Lu Ming.”Tianyun, speak. What despicable methods did you use? Did he secretly harm yang Zaitian?”</p><p>“Assassination?”</p><p>“Do you need to secretly harm yang Zaitian to kill him?” the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up.</p><p>“Nonsense, it’s not an assassination? You can kill yang Zaitian? Even ten of you won’t be enough.”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi shouted angrily. He did not believe Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and did not explain.</p><p>“Elder Qiu, I have something to say.”</p><p>The young man from the ten directions sword sect spoke again.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi bellowed and the disciple immediately shut up. However, his face was flushed red.</p><p>“If you have something to say, say it quickly!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi thought about what had happened and took a deep breath.</p><p>“Elder Qiu, senior brother yang Zaitian was really killed by tianyun! He was defeated by tianyun!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“How is that possible? Did you see it carefully?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi asked loudly.</p><p>“It’s not just me, most of the fellow disciples here are present as well.”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions Sword School all nodded in agreement, even though their expressions were ugly.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi and the rest were still in disbelief.</p><p>A motley crew of the general stars Hall had actually killed the peerless genius of his ten direction Sword School. This had never happened before.</p><p>“Elder Qiu, you have to seek justice for us. This tianyun is a madman, a beast. Not only did he kill senior brother yang Zaitian, he also took our storage rings. He took all of our senior brothers” storage rings, and all of our wealth was in them. Even the blood ant eggs we got from killing blood ants were all taken away by him.”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School screamed.</p><p>“Ah? What? What?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi and all the elders of the ten directions sword sect were stunned. Their mouths were wide open, and they stood there in a daze.</p><p>The red-haired elder, Hua Chi, and the other members of the imperial family were not much different. They stared at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>“Damn it, you little bastard, I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi only came to his senses after a long while. His hair stood on end and his eyes almost popped out. With a furious roar, he sent a violent wave of true energy toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was already prepared. He pulled Ming Cheng and moved tens of meters away in an instant, rushing toward the red-haired elder and the rest.</p><p>“Qiu Wuzhi, what are you doing?”</p><p>The red-haired old man shouted in anger. He rushed out and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook as the red-haired elder exchanged a blow with Qiu Wuzhi, almost splitting the earth apart.</p><p>“Get lost! Today, I’ll definitely kill that little bastard tianyun!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi glared at Lu Ming and bellowed.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“Little bastard, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi berated.</p><p>old man, do you really think that the omnipresent sword sect is the ruler of the blazing sun Empire? I’m a member of the royal family, and you want to kill me for no reason. Do you have no respect for the four great sects and the royal family? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, using the four major sects and the imperial family to suppress him.</p><p>“For no reason? You killed my ten directions Sword school’s disciples and even stole all of our storage rings. Don’t you deserve to be killed?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi roared.</p><p>haha, what a joke. Let me ask you, does the blood ant secret realm not prohibit killing and plundering? ”</p><p>Lu Ming questioned loudly.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s expression darkened.</p><p>He was unable to answer this question.</p><p>since killing and plundering are not forbidden, it is normal for me to kill your disciples and steal their storage rings. What right do you have to kill me? ”</p><p>furthermore, before I entered the blood ant secret realm, all the disciples of the ten directions Sword School declared that they wanted to kill me. I fought back and killed them. Isn’t that right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he faced Qiu Wuzhi fearlessly and questioned him loudly.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s expression was ugly, and the others from the ten direction sword sect did not say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. Nothing was forbidden in the blood ant secret realm. Killing and plundering were the main theme of the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>what a sharp-tongued little thing. So what? let me tell you, even if the disciples of my Shifang Sword School want to kill you, you have to let them kill you. You can’t resist. If you resist, you’ll die.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi said coldly.</p><p>He was overbearing, direct, and unreasonable.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered to say anything. This old man was simply shameless. He was extremely shameless.</p><p>“Qiu Wuzhi, you’re so f * cking shameless. Only about twenty people from my general stars Hall came out, and the rest were killed by your ten directions Sword School. According to what you said, you’re allowed to kill my general stars Hall’s people, but I’m going to kill them. Alright, then in the future, you guys can go back to the ten square Mountain. I will mine the blood ant secret realm alone.”</p><p>The red-haired old man roared.</p><p>you guys want to mine alone? in your dreams. It’s more like the other way around.</p><p>An old man from the ten direction sword sect sneered.</p><p>“Eccentric red, get lost! I’ll definitely kill tianyun today. Otherwise, I’ll kill all of you as well. When the Army of my ten direction sword sect arrives, the imperial family will be annihilated as well.”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s voice was cold and overbearing.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>Hua Chi shouted.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi actually said that he wanted to destroy the imperial family.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi, your Shifang sword sect is full of wild ambitions. We will kill you all.</p><p>The red-haired old man roared.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s expression was extremely ugly. He couldn’t help but regret saying those words in a moment of anxiety.</p><p>Even if the ten direction sword sect had such ambitions, they couldn’t say it out loud. Or rather, it wasn’t the time to say such things.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi, come. Let’s fight. We won’t rest until one of us is dead!</p><p>The red-haired old man strode forward like a lion. His hair and beard were all standing up, and he was obviously extremely angry.</p><p>I’m going to protect tianyun today. Whoever wants to kill him, kill me first!</p><p>Hua Chi took a step forward, his voice cold and firm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
