Others might be afraid of you, but I’m not. At most, we’ll fight!</p><p>The red-haired old man roared like a Mad Lion.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s face darkened.</p><p>If it was someone else, they might be afraid of the ten direction sword sect, but this red-haired elder was a wild beast. He was lawless and feared no one when he went crazy.</p><p>This was also the reason why the imperial family sent the red-haired old man to lead the team.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi, if you want to fight, then fight. Cut the crap. Otherwise, you will miss the opportunity to enter the blood ant realm.</p><p>The red-haired old man said.</p><p>“Good, very good. Eccentric red, what’s the point of you protecting this kid now? This time, I’ll give you a new mission. Kill this man with all your might in the blood ant secret realm. Whoever kills him will be heavily rewarded!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>alright. Elder, don’t worry. I’ll definitely kill this person with my own hands!</p><p>“This kid’s life is mine!”</p><p>Instantly, all the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect looked at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>also, this time, if you encounter people from the general Star Hall, kill them without mercy. Don’t hold back. Anyone who dares to kill people from my General Star Hall will not only have to die, but everyone else will also have to die!</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi ordered.</p><p>“Don’t worry, elder. This time, we’ll make sure that no one can leave the general Star Hall.”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect said one after another.</p><p>At this moment, all the disciples of the general stars Hall had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>“Damn it, tianyun, it’s all tianyun’s fault. He’s the one who started this mess, why should we be the ones to take the blame?”</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. It was Baichi again.</p><p>that’s right. This matter started because of tianyun. It’s all his fault. Originally, we had a way out with the ten direction Sword School and could have reconciled. It’s all his fault. He’s pushing all of us into the fire pit!</p><p>A green-robed young man on the observing pillar also shouted.</p><p>This person was originally bai Chi’s good friend, so he was naturally on bai Chi’s side.</p><p>As soon as he said that, many people in the general stars Hall looked at Lu Ming in a different light. They felt that what bai chi and the young man in green said made sense.</p><p>how about this? let’s enter the blood ant secret realm and work together to take down tianyun. We’ll hand him over to the ten direction Sword School and make peace with them.</p><p>Baichi shouted.</p><p>“Nonsense! Baichi, what the hell are you talking about?”</p><p>Ming Cheng couldn’t help but cry out.</p><p>He was so angry that his chest hurt. Bai chi and the green-robed young man were too shameless.</p><p>Just now, who was it that had been humiliated by the people of the ten direction Sword School, and the entire general stars Hall had been suppressed to the point where they couldn’t even lift their heads?</p><p>If not for Lu Ming’s intervention, the general Star Hall would have lost a great deal of face.</p><p>Now, they actually made a false countercharge and blamed everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>How could there be such a shameless person in this world?</p><p>“I’m not talking nonsense. That’s the truth. If not for tianyun, things wouldn’t have turned out this way.”</p><p>Baichi clamored.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>At this moment, the red-haired elder rebuked and looked at bai chi coldly, ” “What are you afraid of? At worst, we’ll just have a battle. Tianyun isn’t wrong in this matter!”</p><p>“Elder, the blood ant eggs are important!”</p><p>Bai chi called out.</p><p>hahaha, then what’s Baichi’s name? if that’s the case, we can consider showing mercy.</p><p>Someone from the ten direction sword sect laughed.</p><p>The others also looked at the people from the general Star Hall with a mocking expression.</p><p>They had not even set off yet and there was already internal strife. What a joke.</p><p>“Baichi!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted softly.</p><p>His voice was calm and indifferent, without any emotion.</p><p>Everyone could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Baichi, everything you’ve done today has already determined your fate. I will kill you in the blood ant realm. If I don’t, I, tianyun, will destroy my own cultivation!</p><p>His voice was not loud, but it was extremely cold. There was a terrifying killing intent and determination to kill Baichi.</p><p>Baichi’s face turned pale and he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>elder, look at this. We’re all from the general Star Hall, but tianyun actually threatened to kill me. How can such a vicious person remain in the general Star Hall? I suggest that we expel him from the general Star Hall and disqualify him from the blood ant Mystic realm!</p><p>Baichi looked at the red-haired elder and shouted.</p><p>He was afraid, so afraid that he could die.</p><p>shut up. I don’t care about what happens in the blood ant secret realm. You guys deal with it yourselves.</p><p>The red-haired elder chided. He was clearly unhappy with Baichi’s actions.</p><p>“And you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed the long spear in his hand at the people from the omnidirectional sword sect. His gaze was like lightning, and his aura was demonic.”All of you from the ten direction sword sect want to kill me. Fine, I, tianyun, will accept it. When the time comes, let’s see who will kill who?”</p><p>See who will kill who?</p><p>These four short words swept out like a storm, shaking everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>Such strong self-confidence, such strong spirit, these words, is he going to fight a sect alone?</p><p>“Alright, that’s how a martial artist should be!”</p><p>The red-haired elder roared, his eyes glowing. The more he looked at Lu Ming, the more he liked him.</p><p>arrogant, ignorant. If you have some combat power, you can’t tell North from South.</p><p>“There are quite a few people in the ten direction sword sect who can kill him.”</p><p>kill him! When we reach the blood ant secret realm, we must kill him!</p><p>The disciples of the ten direction sword sect shouted one by one. Their gazes were penetrating like tigers eyeing their prey.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A loud and clear sword cry resounded through the entire area. A beam of sword Qi shot up into the sky, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>It was yang Zaitian. His black hair was dancing in the wind and his eyes were like stars. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”He’s my prey. If I encounter him, I’ll definitely kill him!”</p><p>Everyone from the ten direction sword sect was shocked.</p><p>“Yang Zaitian has the intention to kill him. He’s dead for sure. There’s no chance for him to live!”</p><p>it’s a rare thing to attract the attention of senior brother yang Zaitian. It’s his honor!</p><p>The disciple of the ten directions sword sect laughed.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, you must be prepared to be killed by me.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile as he glared at yang Zaitian.</p><p>A confrontation!</p><p>“You don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect sneered.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>The red-haired old man suddenly let out a loud roar and led the way into the depths of the barren mountain.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi shouted coldly and brought the people from the ten direction Sword School to follow.</p><p>The group ran for thousands of meters and stopped in a pile of stones.</p><p>However, these rocks were all engraved with inscriptions.</p><p>“Eccentric red, let’s start!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi looked at the red-haired elder.</p><p>The red-haired elder nodded and walked to one side of the rocks with the other elders. Qiu Wuzhi, on the other hand, walked to the other side of the rocks with the elders of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>The two sides shouted at the same time and waved their hands. A strong true Qi gushed out and poured into the stones.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The inscriptions glowed and a door of light appeared in the pile of rocks.</p><p>This was the entrance to the blood ant realm.</p><p>“Enter!”</p><p>On the general Star Hall’s side, someone impatiently rushed towards the light door. His figure rushed into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>“We have ten days to enter this time. What’s the use of being so impatient?”</p><p>Some of the disciples from the ten direction sword sect sneered.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
