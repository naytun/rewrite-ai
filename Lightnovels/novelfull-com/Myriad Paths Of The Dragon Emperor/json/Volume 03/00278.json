Following that, the people Dao palm print shattered inch by inch. A terrifying force surged towards Lu Ming and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>Zi song’s combat strength was indeed extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that as his cultivation level increased, the opponents he faced would also become stronger. When he was facing these young martial arts grandmasters, his advantage in many aspects was no longer as obvious.</p><p>Almost all of these young martial Grandmaster powerhouses had cultivated earth rank martial arts techniques and comprehended force. Moreover, they had all mastered it.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had a slight advantage in martial arts techniques and force, it was not big.</p><p>Also, how could a martial Grandmaster’s cultivation technique be a yellow grade cultivation technique? it was usually a black grade upper level cultivation technique, and it was not surprising that some people even cultivated an earth grade cultivation technique.</p><p>The higher the level of the cultivation technique, the thicker and more condensed the true Qi cultivated would be.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming’s essential Qi to be five times more than these people. Therefore, his advantage was further reduced.</p><p>It was even more difficult to fight above one’s level. That was why Lu Ming was forced to retreat by Zi song.</p><p>However, he did not know that Zi song was even more shocked. He was a peerless genius, not an ordinary second grade martial arts Grandmaster. He found it unbelievable that his full-powered palm strike only forced Lu Ming back and did not kill him.</p><p>kill, kill! This brat’s talent is even higher than mine. He can’t be allowed to live in this world.</p><p>Zi song roared in his heart and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing also made his move. Black Lotus flowers formed around her. The black petals danced and enveloped Zi song. At the same time, she waved her palms and a black palm print whistled out.</p><p>“Bitch, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Zi song shouted as he directed a portion of his power at Xie nianqing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Immediately, the three of them engaged in a great battle.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat strength was also extremely shocking. He was not any weaker than Lu Ming. The two of them joined forces and were evenly matched with Zi song.</p><p>Zi song’s face was extremely gloomy. The more the battle, the more frightened he was.</p><p>The three of them fought, and their energy shot out in all directions. However, inscriptions appeared on the walls of the seventh floor, which absorbed most of the force. Otherwise, those Yiyuan ancient panaceas would have been shattered.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 50 moves had been exchanged.</p><p>On the sixth floor, the three first level martial arts Grandmaster youths stood there. As they heard the violent boom coming from the seventh floor, the three of them looked at each other.</p><p>Who was Zi song fighting with? Could it be the ninth grade great Martial Master realm couple from before?</p><p>But how was that possible? Two ninth grade great Martial Master realm cultivators were able to fight Zi song to such an extent? Then what were they? Trash?</p><p>They were in disbelief.</p><p>But other than the young man and woman, there was no one else on top.</p><p>The three of them decided to wait on the sixth floor.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>Zi song roared angrily. The golden light around his body was boiling and extremely dense.</p><p>He roared in his heart and wanted to kill Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, but he could not do it.</p><p>After a while, the golden light on Zi song’s body began to dissipate rapidly.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! You two B * stards, you b * stard couple, just you wait! I, Zi song, swear I’m not a human if I don’t kill you!”</p><p>Zi song bellowed in anger and waved his palm a few times, blocking Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s attacks. Then, he ran towards the sixth floor and disappeared from the stairs in an instant.</p><p>He had used up a lot of his essential Qi to maintain the golden light. He could not hold on any longer and could only run. Otherwise, he would be killed by Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>On the sixth floor, the three young men were waiting. Suddenly, they saw Zi song rushing down from the seventh floor at top speed. He ran down in a hurry.</p><p>The three young men were stunned.</p><p>could it be that Zi song has been defeated? ”</p><p>The three young men looked at each other and gasped.</p><p>Then, without any hesitation, they ran.</p><p>On the seventh floor, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing scanned their surroundings.</p><p>There were two shelves in total, and each of them was filled with Jade bottles, all of which were Yiyuan ancient panaceas.</p><p>“Let’s split it half each!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked to one of the shelves while Xie nianqing walked to the other.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and calculated that there were forty-nine Jade bottles in total.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a Jade bottle. As soon as he opened it, he could smell a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>In the Jade bottle, there were nine round, milky-white pills.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He waved his hand and kept all the Jade bottles into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing also put away the Yiyuan ancient panaceas with a smile on his face.</p><p>“With these Yiyuan ancient panaceas, I will be able to reach the martial arts Grandmaster realm very soon. At that time, I will definitely trample you under my feet.”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming and said fiercely.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Why did this girl keep thinking about this?</p><p>Immediately, Xie nianqing led the way and walked down. Lu Ming smiled and followed closely behind.</p><p>After going downstairs, there was no one on the lower floors. When the two of them left the pavilion, they found that the people outside had also left.</p><p>No one knew how long they could stay in this secret realm, and no one was willing to waste time. Since this place was not suitable, they would definitely find another place.</p><p>The two of them left the pavilion, randomly chose a direction, and ran at top speed.</p><p>They wanted to find a secluded place to consume the Yiyuan ancient panaceas and improve their cultivation.</p><p>Half an hour later, the two of them passed by a dilapidated Palace.</p><p>hurry up and run! Zhao Hong, one of the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao Empire, is inside!</p><p>A terrified shout came from the old palace.</p><p>Immediately, more than 20 young men ran out of the dilapidated Palace in horror.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! a cold shout full of killing intent came from the dilapidated Palace, and then a terrifying Saber Light burst out.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Miserable shrieks were heard continuously. More than 20 young men had been killed by this blade.</p><p>Runes filled the air as blood refining crystals were formed.</p><p>A young man with disheveled hair and a long blade on his back stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, he collected all the blood refining crystals and looked forward.</p><p>A sharp killing intent filled the air.</p><p>A thousand meters away, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and left the place with Xie nianqing.</p><p>This young man was too strong. He was not someone the two of them could fight against.</p><p>The blood Zhao’s 50 super rookies were geniuses on the same level as the scorching sun’s six heroes.</p><p>Zhao Hong’s eyes flickered as he watched Lu Ming and Xie nianqing leave. He did not pursue them. Instead, he turned around and entered the dilapidated Palace.</p><p>Fifty miles away, screams came from a Valley.</p><p>“It’s Duan Ling, one of the nine heroes of the Dark Moon Empire. Don’t, don’t kill me …” He said.</p><p>The next moment, a shocking sword Qi burst out of the valley. More than a dozen young experts were killed by the sword and turned into blood refining crystals.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was the first or second martial ancestor realm, none of them could escape the fate of death.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, who saw this scene from afar, did not stop at all. They turned and left.</p><p>A few hundred miles away from Lu Ming and the rest, yang Liuji laughed out loud in the ruins. Around him, there were at least fifty corpses of young men lying there, their blood Qi condensed into blood refining crystals.</p><p>In the secret realm, there was killing at all times. Only the strong could survive and seize opportunities.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
