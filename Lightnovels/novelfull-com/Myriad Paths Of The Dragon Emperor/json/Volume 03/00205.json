Lu Ming only knew of a clam cave in the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>The royal family that had once ruled the burning sun Empire was indeed powerful.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, which one do you plan on going to first?”</p><p>Ming Feng asked.</p><p>“Earth Yuan cave!” Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>“Okay, I want to go too. Let’s go together!”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Then you two go to the earth cave. I’m going to the foggy Marsh to practice a martial skill, so I won’t be going with you.”</p><p>Mingzhu said with a smile.</p><p>“Sister, you should hurry up and go!”</p><p>Ming Feng urged.</p><p>“You brat, you’ve just arrived at the general stars Hall, so don’t cause any trouble!”</p><p>Mingzhu glared at Ming Feng, then left.</p><p>big brother tianyun, let’s go to the earth cave together!</p><p>Ming Feng shouted, looking extremely excited.</p><p>Earth cave, just ask a senior student and he would know the way.</p><p>The two of them passed through many palaces and came to a mountain peak.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge stone wall with a stone door on it. Two middle-aged men were guarding the door.</p><p>The two middle-aged men were just casually standing there, but they exuded an aura that was as deep as the ocean.</p><p>what a strong cultivation. He is definitely a martial arts Grandmaster!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Everyone said that the imperial family had declined, but it seemed that their strength was still not to be underestimated.</p><p>In the mystical sword sect, a martial arts Grandmaster was an expert at the level of a silver-robed elder.</p><p>“Senior, we’re here to cultivate in the earth cave!”</p><p>Ming Feng walked in front of a burly man and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Let me take a look at your identity Jade token!”</p><p>The large man said expressionlessly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ming Feng took out their identity Jade cards and handed them to the burly man.</p><p>The burly man took it and looked at it before nodding, ” you can go in and Exchange for the inscription stones first. Only with the inscription stones can you open the secret training room in the earth cave.</p><p>“Alright, thank you, senior!” Ming Feng nodded and took out the spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming also took out his spirit crystals.</p><p>On the way here, Ming Feng had already explained the situation in the earth cave to Lu Ming in detail.</p><p>The imperial family had carved out 13 levels of the earth cave.</p><p>There were some secret training rooms on each floor, which were filled with rich fire-property spiritual Qi. It was very useful for improving cultivation, refining genuine Qi, and practicing fire-property martial skills.</p><p>The lower he went, the denser the spiritual Qi was, and the better the effect.</p><p>However, they couldn’t let people cultivate for free. Each secret room was engraved with an inscription stone. Only the imperial family’s inscription stone could open the secret room and enter it to cultivate.</p><p>Inscription stones, 30 spiritual crystals for one.</p><p>Of course, the further down he went, the more rune stones he needed.</p><p>“How many inscription stones do you want to exchange?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked Ming Feng.</p><p>“One piece, one piece is enough!”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>On the first level of the earth cave, one only needed an inscription stone to open a secret cultivation room and cultivate for a month.</p><p>Ming Feng took out 30 spiritual crystals and handed them to the middle-aged man.</p><p>Then, the middle-aged man handed Ming Feng a fiery red stone that was engraved with inscriptions.</p><p>“How about you? how many runestones do you need?</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>“I’ll exchange for 100 yuan first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Ah? What? A hundred Yuan?”</p><p>The two middle-aged men were shocked.</p><p>Ming Feng also widened his eyes.</p><p>One hundred rune stones would cost three thousand spiritual crystals, which was equivalent to thirty million taels of silver. How could Lu Ming have so many spiritual crystals at such a young age?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His fingers glowed and a Jade box appeared. There were rows of spiritual crystals neatly stacked inside.</p><p>Lu Ming took out three thousand spiritual crystals and handed them to the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged burly man took it and took out a hundred inscription stones, handing them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go in and cultivate!”</p><p>The two middle-aged men finally smiled.</p><p>The stone door opened and Lu Ming and Ming Feng walked in.</p><p>As soon as he entered, he felt a strong fire-attribute spiritual Qi blowing in his face.</p><p>After walking forward for about a hundred meters, a huge underground cave appeared.</p><p>The surroundings were well-maintained, and it was obvious that it was man-made.</p><p>Around the cave, there were many secret training rooms.</p><p>The doors of the secret rooms were all closed, but some of them were shimmering with a faint light, indicating that someone was cultivating inside.</p><p>If there was no light on the door, it meant that no one was cultivating inside.</p><p>In the middle was a hole.</p><p>As he walked in, he saw that there was a spiral stone staircase leading down the cave.</p><p>This was the first floor, and the second floor was just below.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, which level do you plan on going to cultivate? I’ll be cultivating here.”</p><p>Ming Feng said with a hint of envy.</p><p>“The world Energy here isn’t very dense, let’s go down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Go down? But my inscription stone …”</p><p>“Don’t I have it here? I haven’t even thanked you for talking so much with me. Let’s go down together, my treat. ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“You’re really inviting me? Then I won’t be polite!”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed and did not hold back at all.</p><p>Ming Feng’s young heart was true to his nature and he was not so indirect.</p><p>He took the lead and headed to the second level.</p><p>The space on the second floor was no smaller than the first floor.</p><p>The layout was almost the same as the first level, except that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was richer. Lu Ming could almost feel the scorching spiritual energy of heaven and earth wrapping around his body continuously as if it was going to drill into his body.</p><p>“The earth Yuan cave is indeed worthy of its reputation. And this is the outside of the secret room. If I cultivate in the secret room, my cultivation will probably increase ten times faster than outside. Besides, it’s definitely very useful to cultivate fire attribute martial skills. It’s also very useful to comprehend the fire Force. I’ve made the right decision to come here today.”</p><p>this is only the second level, but the fire spiritual Qi is already so dense. It is said that there are 13 levels in the earth cave. I wonder what it will be like if I go further down? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, to open a secret room for cultivation for a month on this floor, you need three inscription stones!”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Continue down!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and headed to the third level.</p><p>Ming Feng hurriedly followed.</p><p>On the third floor, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was even denser.</p><p>On this floor, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he saw five to six young men sitting cross-legged in the middle of the open space.</p><p>Although the world Energy Qi in the open space outside was still quite rich, it couldn’t be compared to the one inside the secret room.</p><p>What were these people doing outside?</p><p>Ming Feng seemed to have thought of something. His expression changed and he whispered to Lu Ming, ” I’ve heard from my sister that some people don’t have spiritual crystals to exchange for inscription stones in the earth Yuan cave, so they Rob other people’s Secret practicing rooms here. When someone opens a secret room, they’ll seize it.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>It seemed that no matter where it was, disputes of interest were inevitable.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
