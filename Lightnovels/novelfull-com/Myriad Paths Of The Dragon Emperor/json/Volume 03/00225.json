The difference was huge.</p><p>Shui shuihen’s face turned red.</p><p>Previously, he was extremely proud and looked down on Lu Ming with the attitude that he had comprehended the control force.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, Lu Ming gave him a tight slap in the face with an even stronger force.</p><p>The things that he was proud of were not worth mentioning in Lu Ming’s eyes. This dealt a serious blow to his self-confidence.</p><p>“Kill him! Let’s kill him together!”</p><p>Lu Ming! Shui shuihen roared in anger. He had to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More than thirty disciples from the ten directions Sword School roared and ran on the lake, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It wasn’t difficult for a third grade great Martial Master or above to walk on water.</p><p>More than thirty people attacked at the same time. Their power was extremely terrifying. The surface of the lake was suddenly filled with violent waves that swept across like a tsunami.</p><p>A murderous intent flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he shook the demon subduing spear.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>Dozens of spear lights shot out.</p><p>These spearlights, under the support of wind force, were shockingly fast and had a terrifying penetrative ability.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and screams rang out. In an instant, more than ten young men from the ten directions Sword School were assassinated.</p><p>Blood dyed the lake red.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and rushed into the crowd like a tiger among a flock of sheep. He was invincible and took the lives of the disciples of the ten direction sword sect without restraint.</p><p>Not far away, the students from the general Star Hall stopped and looked at this scene with pale faces.</p><p>“Isn’t this du Tian Yun too ruthless? You really dare to kill the disciples of the ten directions Sword School?”</p><p>ruthless! This is a truly ruthless man!</p><p>The throat of the students from the general Star Hall squirmed as they cried out in shock.</p><p>Shui lihen’s face turned pale as he shouted, ” “Kill, kill him!”</p><p>His figure, on the other hand, was rushing towards the flood Dragon Spirit fruit.</p><p>“Shui liuhen, you’re despicable!”</p><p>A disciple from the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>Within the same sect, there was originally a lot of competition. Of course, they could not be so United.</p><p>At this moment, Shui liuhen was the first to escape. He wanted to seize the opportunity to snatch the flood dragon fruit, but they naturally wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>“Let’s go and snatch the flood Dragon Spirit fruit!”</p><p>“The flood dragon fruit is mine.”</p><p>The remaining ten direction sword sect disciples immediately abandoned Lu Ming and ran towards the flood Dragon Spirit fruit.</p><p>“How can it be so easy to come and kill and leave as you please?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He pounced like an eagle and drew his long spear. Two disciples from the ten directions Sword School screamed in pain as they were killed on the lake.</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s feet touched the surface of the lake and his figure quickly chased after Shui shuihen.</p><p>At this moment, the stream of water was already approaching the flood dragon fruit.</p><p>“Hahaha, the flood Dragon Spirit fruit is mine. As long as I pluck the flood Dragon Spirit fruit, hide at the bottom of the lake, and refine the flood Dragon Spirit fruit, then, that will be the day of tianyun’s death!”</p><p>A cold glint flickered in Shui lihen’s eyes. At the same time, he was excited. He reached out his hand and genuine Qi gushed out. He was about to pick the serpent spirit fruit.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, the surface of the lake suddenly churned, and a giant claw covered in sharp thorns reached out from the lake and grabbed at the water trace.</p><p>“What the hell is this thing!”</p><p>Shui shuihen’s expression changed. He slashed out his sword and hit The Giant Claw. Sparks flew and he was sent flying by the claw.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Shui shuihen roared in anger. He almost spat out blood when he saw the fat meat in his mouth disappear just like that.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The surface of the lake churned, and another giant claw slapped out. The two disciples of the ten directions Sword School were caught off guard and were instantly smashed into meat patties.</p><p>From then on, only ten or so of the thirty or so disciples of the ten directions Sword School were left. They had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The lake water surged, and the thing under the lake was finally revealed.</p><p>It was a monster that was dozens of meters long, covered in spikes, and had a long and sharp mouth.</p><p>“Anteater? Could this be an anteater?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>This guy looked very similar to the anteater, and it was very likely. The blood ant secret realm bred a large number of blood ants, so it was normal for anteaters to feed on blood ants.</p><p>However, this anteater was a little too big.</p><p>The anteater appeared and let out a sharp cry. It paddled the lake water and pounced towards Shui hen and the others.</p><p>The shocking thing was that the lake water behind Lu Ming and the rest was surging and another anteater appeared.</p><p>The two anteaters formed an encirclement and charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>More than a dozen spikes shot out from the anteater’s body.</p><p>The sharp spikes pierced through the air, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>A sharp spike shot toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming pulled out his spear and flicked the spike away.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt his arm go numb. The anteater’s strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>it’s at least a class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast!</p><p>Lu Ming made a judgment.</p><p>He was able to strike away the spikes of the anteaters, but the others were not so lucky.</p><p>The screams rose and fell.</p><p>Twelve people from both the general stars Hall and the ten direction Sword School were killed in an instant, and blood dyed the lake.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The remaining people from the general stars Hall and the ten direction sword sect turned pale with fright. They didn’t care about the flood Dragon Spirit fruit and ran for their lives towards the shore.</p><p>However, how could he escape so easily when two powerful demonic beasts, which were equivalent to ninth grade great Martial Master realm, joined forces?</p><p>A few more corpses were left behind. In the end, only eight people from both sides managed to escape to the shore.</p><p>Once they reached the shore, the anteaters stopped their pursuit.</p><p>However, there was an exception, and that was Lu Ming.</p><p>He didn’t rush to the shore, but to the flood Dragon Spirit fruit.</p><p>As soon as he charged at the flood Dragon Spirit fruit, the two anteaters became even more violent. They shrieked continuously and charged at Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>The giant claws covered in sharp spikes clawed at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming pushed his midair step to its maximum. He seemed to be weightless and was constantly flashing.</p><p>One moment he was on the lake, the next moment he was in the air. Although the two anteaters tried their best to stop him, they could not stop Lu Ming from advancing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly emerged from the water below the flood Dragon Spirit fruit. He grabbed the fruit and plucked it.</p><p>This figure was actually water current mark. He didn’t rush to the shore just now, but took the opportunity to dive into the water.</p><p>The cultivation technique he cultivated, in addition to the force of water, had a great advantage underwater.</p><p>“Hahaha, the flood Dragon Spirit fruit is mine!”</p><p>Shui lihen laughed wildly in his heart, but his face was filled with excitement. With a thought, he kept the flood Dragon Spirit fruit into his storage ring.</p><p>Just as he was about to dive into the water to escape, over a dozen extremely sharp spearlights stabbed at him.</p><p>“You want to take the flood Dragon Spirit fruit? You wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His body flashed and he closed in on Shui liuhen.</p><p>“Tianyun, you deserve to die!”</p><p>Water current scar bellowed.</p><p>The two anteaters became furious when the flood Dragon Spirit fruit was plucked. They twisted their bodies and shot out dozens of sharp spikes.</p><p>The water current Mark’s body moved and was about to enter the water.</p><p>However, at this moment, a tail covered in spikes was pulled up from below him.</p><p>It was the tail of an anteater.</p><p>“Tianyun, get lost!”</p><p>The water current had no way to retreat. It could only rush up and slash out with its combat sword. Many swords of water condensed and slashed at Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
