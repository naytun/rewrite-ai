No matter who it was, he would take revenge ten times, no, a hundred times more.</p><p>Would he still be considered a man if he didn’t take revenge?</p><p>The people he wanted to harm would end up ten times, no, a hundred times more miserable than Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Lu Yuntian muttered to himself for a moment before saying, ” Ming ‘er, I can tell you, but you must not be rash. This person is not someone you can defeat. Promise me and I’ll tell you.</p><p>“Father, I promise you that I won’t die before I’m strong enough.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll tell you. This person is Yi.”</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Four figures rushed in from the mountain stream.</p><p>These four were all white-haired old men, and the aura on their bodies was extremely strong. They were all experts above the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and a ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>A short, chubby old man in gray linen clothes smiled as a voice transmission talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, I’ve heard so much about you. I didn’t think that you would be able to save your father from Qiu changkong’s eyes. You’re truly admirable.”</p><p>The short and fat old man cupped his fists.</p><p>“Senior is too polite. I was just lucky. This time, I’ll have to trouble senior to send us back to the imperial capital.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>you’re welcome. It’s just a small matter. Let’s not waste any time. Let’s move as soon as possible. If the people from the ten direction Sword School find us here, we’ll be in trouble.</p><p>The short stubby elder said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of something flying through the air could be heard in the distant sky. A few figures streaked across the sky and instantly disappeared into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that those figures were the martial grandmasters from the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>“The ten direction sword sect is so fast!”</p><p>The stumpy old man’s expression changed greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>This mountain stream was very well hidden, and it was surrounded by bushes and weeds, so the people from the ten directions sword sect did not notice it just now. However, as time passed, they would definitely notice it.</p><p>“What do we do? If we go out like this, we’ll definitely be discovered. If Qiu changkong arrives, we won’t be his match even if we join forces.”</p><p>The other old man said with a serious expression.</p><p>“Seniors, I’ll have to trouble you to take Ming ‘er and the others away. I’m the one Qiu changkong and the others want. I’ll go and draw them away.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>“No, father. It wasn’t easy to save you. How can I let you fall into the hands of Qiu changkong and the others?”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>Even if he had to die, he would not let Lu Yuntian fall into the hands of the ten directions sword sect and suffer.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, essential Qi surged, and Lu Yuntian’s tattered clothes landed in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you can’t!” Lu Yuntian’s expression changed.</p><p>The other people’s expressions also changed.</p><p>“Seniors, I’ll go out and draw them away. You guys take my father back to the imperial capital and hand him over to His Highness, the eighth prince.”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the few elders.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you can’t do this. I don’t agree.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian let out a deep roar.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. father, don’t worry. Ming ‘er will be fine. We’ll meet again in the imperial capital.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll go with you.”</p><p>Xie nianqing suddenly said.</p><p>“You’re coming?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Hmph, don’t think too much. I’m just afraid that if you die, I won’t be able to keep my promise. Also, how are you going to lure the people from the ten direction Sword School away by yourself? don’t forget that your father’s cultivation has been crippled. If you run too fast, you won’t be exposed immediately. I’ll take you away!</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that. I owe you a favor.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Tsk, who wants your favor?”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted in disdain.</p><p>“Father, take care!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming was about to rush out.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you can’t. Come back!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian growled.</p><p>However, he had lost his cultivation and could not catch up with Lu Ming. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were out of the mountain stream.</p><p>After leaving the mountain stream, Lu Ming put on Lu Yuntian’s clothes.</p><p>“I’ll take you away!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pulled Lu Ming and ran towards the depths of the desolate wilderness.</p><p>If he wanted to lure the people from the ten direction Sword School away, he would naturally have to do so in the depths of the desolate wilderness so that Lu Yuntian and the others could escape successfully.</p><p>After a few miles.</p><p>“Over here, I see them.”</p><p>A loud roar rang out in the desolate wilderness.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few figures were chasing after Lu Ming and the rest at high speed.</p><p>They were a few ninth grade great martial masters.</p><p>“Let’s run together!”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be pulled by Xie nianqing. In fact, he had used his movement technique. The two of them were like a gust of wind, heading towards the depths of the Forsaken desolation.</p><p>The ninth grade great Martial Master realm martial artists behind him couldn’t catch up at all. The difference was too great.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of miles had passed.</p><p>who dares to Rob the people of my ten direction Sword School? you’re courting death!</p><p>At this moment, the sky exploded and the sound of the air being torn could be heard. A martial arts Grandmaster was flying in the air and chasing after them.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing ignored him and ran away with gritted teeth.</p><p>Just like that, he ran for a few hundred miles.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, there were six figures in the sky. They were the six martial arts grandmasters of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>At that moment, they were getting closer and closer to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>No matter how fast they were, they were still slower than flying in the air. They were slowly being caught up.</p><p>Whoosh! Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>Beams of sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming and his partner. The two of them flashed and dodged them.</p><p>A moment later, another hundred miles had passed in a flash.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, an elder was already approaching Lu Ming and su lingyue.</p><p>This elder’s aura was extremely thick. He was the 4th level martial ancestor realm expert from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>With a cold expression, he waved his sword, and dozens of bright sword Qi shot out.</p><p>It completely enveloped the two of them.</p><p>“Not good, block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and four ancient shields appeared behind him.</p><p>Xie nianqing also shouted and waved his palm. Black Lotus flowers appeared behind him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ancient shield and the Black Lotus exploded one after another, and a strong force shot out in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing made use of this force to charge forward for thousands of meters.</p><p>“You’re not Lu Yuntian. We’ve been tricked.”</p><p>The old man let out an earth-shaking roar.</p><p>haha, it’s too late to realize it now. My men have already brought Lu Yuntian out of the Forsaken desolation land. You bunch of idiots!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Lu Yuntian ran away, so I’ll kill you all!”</p><p>The old man roared angrily and continued to chase after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After chasing for a while, he slashed again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing used the same trick again. They blocked with their shields and black Lotus flowers and used the momentum to charge forward.</p><p>The old man in the sky was so angry that he almost vomited blood. At the same time, he was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were only ninth grade Grandmaster cultivators. Not only were they unbelievably fast, but their defensive abilities were also frighteningly high.</p><p>Although there was a distance between them, it was already terrifying enough to block his sword Qi.</p><p>“The fourth level of Wu Zong is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
