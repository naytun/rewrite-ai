The entire world seemed to be shaking.</p><p>However, the stone door did not open.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The blood demon continued to attack, and the stone door kept shaking. Finally, it slowly opened a gap.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to hear a deafening roar from outside the stone door.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>But he didn’t have time to think too much. He strode forward and shouted, ” “Let’s go out!”</p><p>Xie nianqing followed closely behind.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the blood demon roared loudly and stopped in its tracks. A thought was transmitted into Lu Ming’s mind. Lu Ming roughly understood what the blood demon meant. It grew up here and could not get out at all. Once it got out, it would be turned into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. If such a powerful blood demon were to follow them out, he would be able to sweep through the blazing sun Empire. He might even be able to attack the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>What a pity! Lu Ming roared in his heart, but there was nothing he could do. He could only abandon the blood demon and rush towards the stone door with Xie nianqing.</p><p>The stone door was too big. Although it was only opened a crack, it was enough for two people to pass through.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them moved like the wind. As soon as they passed through the stone door, they felt the world spin. The next moment, they found themselves standing on a Hill.</p><p>Behind him, a blood-colored mist filled the air. It was clearly the blood Realm and Devil’s Den.</p><p>In front of him were green mountains and clear waters, full of life.</p><p>However, at this moment, the mountain peak in front of them trembled. A blood-colored pillar of light shot up into the sky, piercing through the clouds. It could be seen from a hundred miles away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>On the side, another mountain peak trembled. Immediately after, another blood-colored light pillar shot out, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were both dumbfounded.</p><p>Where was this place? Why did he look so unfamiliar? And this blood-red light pillar, could it be caused by them opening the huge stone door?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard, and a few figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>They were a few middle-aged men. The aura on their bodies was as thick as a mountain. They were obviously strong practitioners of the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>there’s a change outside the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave. Is there a rare treasure coming into being? ”</p><p>“Hurry up and inform the sect!”</p><p>The few burly men muttered to themselves. Then, they stepped on the air and disappeared.</p><p>However, not long after, more people came. Some of them came by stepping on the air. They were all martial arts grandmasters, and there were also some martial artists in the Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Through the conversation of these people, Lu Ming learned a fact that made him dumbfounded.</p><p>This place was actually not within the blazing sun Empire’s territory, but on the other side of the desolate wilderness, the border between the blood Zhao Empire and the yin moon Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had actually run in the wrong direction.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know whether to laugh or cry. He and Xie nianqing stared at each other.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The shaking became more and more intense. In the end, a total of nine blood-red light pillars appeared and shot into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, there were already no less than a hundred people gathered.</p><p>this place is most likely the ruins of the ancient sect, the cloud Emperor Palace.</p><p>In the sky, a white-haired old man speculated.</p><p>“What? It’s the ancient sect, cloud Emperor Palace?”</p><p>Some people were shocked and expressed their doubts.</p><p>“That’s a senior from the great sun House. His guess shouldn’t be wrong,”</p><p>that’s right. The great sun House is the number one sect in the blood Zhao. It has existed for a long time and is extremely knowledgeable. We can’t compare to it.</p><p>“Haha, what a great opportunity!”</p><p>Some people were discussing excitedly.</p><p>the ancient sect, cloud Emperor Palace!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The cloud Emperor mountain range was called the cloud Emperor mountain range because of the cloud Emperor Palace, which showed how powerful the cloud Emperor Palace was.</p><p>This place was actually the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace. Lu Ming definitely had to explore and did not want to miss it.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing sat cross-legged at the side, healing their injuries while waiting.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people arrived.</p><p>It was obvious that the news had already spread.</p><p>Seven days later, there was already a sea of people in all directions.</p><p>Even the sky was filled with people.</p><p>Some were from the blood Zhao Empire, and some were from the yin Yue Empire.</p><p>Of course, most of them were from the blood Zhao Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. The blood Zhao Empire was indeed powerful. Those standing in the air were all Grandmaster level experts. There were no less than a thousand of them.</p><p>The blood Zhao Empire was indeed a mid-tier Empire. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>the great sun mansion has sent hundreds of experts and core elders. It seems that we won’t get a share in the remains of the cloud Emperor Palace.</p><p>that’s right. Many experts from the other sects of blood Zhao have also come. Even the royal family of the Dark Moon Empire has come.</p><p>there are also many young experts, such as the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao Empire and the experts of the nine heroes of the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>Nearby, the sounds of discussion could be heard from time to time.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry resounded through the sky. It was extremely ear-piercing.</p><p>Then, a huge Crow appeared in the sky.</p><p>This Crow was extremely huge, with a wingspan of 30 meters. Its body was covered in blazing flames, and the demonic Qi on its body was soaring. It was a terrifying level four demonic beast.</p><p>A level four demonic beast was equivalent to a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>On the back of the crow stood a young man in his twenties. He was wearing a fiery red robe with a big sun embroidered on it.</p><p>His hands were placed behind his back as he looked at the blood-colored light pillars. He had an aura of disdain.</p><p>“Yang Liuji, this person is yang Liuji? Yang Liuji, who is ranked 33rd on the cloud Emperor board?”</p><p>“Who else could it be besides him?”</p><p>even the geniuses of the cloud Emperor ranking are here.</p><p>There was a commotion in the crowd.</p><p>Clearly, the name of the six extremes of yang had shaken the hearts of the people.</p><p>“Number 33 on the cloud Emperor board? Is this man stronger than Qiu changkong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The 36 geniuses on Emperor Yun’s list could be said to be the strongest 36 people of this generation in the 36 kingdoms of Emperor Yun.</p><p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, another two days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s injuries had already healed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the nine blood-red light pillars let out a violent roar. The light grew brighter and then actually gathered together.</p><p>A moment later, the blood light disappeared, and a huge black Vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>this is the spatial teleportation path. It leads to the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace!</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Immediately, dozens of people rushed into the vortex.</p><p>“Ah!” Ah!</p><p>In the next moment, a blood-curdling screech was heard. More than half of the dozens of people suddenly exploded, and their blood and flesh splattered all over the ground.</p><p>However, the other half of the people rushed into the whirlpool and disappeared.</p><p>“What’s going on? How did this happen? Why is it that when someone died, someone else charged in?”</p><p>“What are the restrictions?”</p><p>Everyone else on the scene stopped, not daring to rush into the vortex.</p><p>An old man with a head full of white hair appeared in front of the vortex and carefully observed it.</p><p>&Nbsp; everyone recognized that he was a core elder of the great sun mansion.</p><p>The white-haired old man carefully observed it. After a while, he said,”If I’m not wrong, this place should be covered with inscriptions of time.”</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
