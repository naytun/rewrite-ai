His combat strength was even more terrifying. To put it bluntly, a single hair from such a figure could benefit him greatly. It was not in Lu Ming’s character to not take advantage of him.</p><p>The eyelids of the nine suns Supreme martial artist kept twitching, and the corners of his mouth were trembling.</p><p>A God-level martial technique? Divine level medicinal pill? Dozens of them?</p><p>What did Lu Ming think a God-level was? Cabbages?</p><p>“Senior, what’s wrong? Was he not feeling well? Why is the corner of your mouth trembling?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>“No, nothing.”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang took a deep breath to calm himself down and continued, ” you may be disappointed about this. I escaped as a wisp of my remnant soul. After I came out, I only brought this Supreme shrine and a drop of Nine Dragons ‘blood essence. As for the things I placed on the first few platforms, they were all obtained by accident after I escaped.</p><p>also, there’s actually nothing on the platforms at the back. I deliberately placed a box on each platform to motivate you to work hard in cultivation.</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang said with slight embarrassment.</p><p>“Ah? The platforms behind are empty?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded and speechless. After a while, he asked tentatively, ” “Even if I don’t have any treasures, I’m sure you do have some martial skills. As the nine suns Supreme, senior should know a lot of cultivation methods and martial skills. Just pass me a few of them.”</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Nine suns Supreme coughed a few times and said, ” I’m afraid I can’t do that. Di Yi knows all the martial techniques I have practiced. Once you practice the martial techniques I have practiced, Di Yi will probably sense it. A martial Royal realm expert is too powerful.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was completely speechless.</p><p>It turned out that there was no benefit at all for him to agree to avenge him and kill Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>but don’t be disappointed. I can’t give you what I’ve cultivated, but I can still teach you what I haven’t. When I came to the nine Dragon ruins, I didn’t only bring two drops of nine dragon blood essence, but also a cultivation technique and a martial technique.</p><p>that cultivation technique is the true war Dragon technique that you’re cultivating. It’s a God-tier cultivation technique. There’s also a martial technique that goes with the true war Dragon technique. It’s called the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. It’s also a God-tier martial technique.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme martial artist also felt a little embarrassed and quickly said.</p><p>“What? Is there really a God-level martial technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. His eyes emitted a bright glow, like two bright Suns.</p><p>When he mentioned the God-level martial techniques and God-level elixirs, he was simply asking for too much. He never thought that the nine suns Supreme would really have God-level martial techniques.</p><p>It was a divine martial technique, and its name seemed to be related to the nine Dragons.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme Master waved his hand, and a secret manual flew out of the main hall. The secret manual was neither gold nor Jade, and it was impossible to tell what material it was made of.</p><p>this is the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. According to my speculation, it should be a martial technique created by the nine Dragons. Its power is terrifying and boundless. Even I have never cultivated it before. You’re really lucky.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme handed the manual to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly took it and opened it to read in joy.</p><p>As soon as he flipped it open, it was as if he saw a real Dragon with nine claws walking in the sky. A terrifying aura acted on Lu Ming’s body, and he felt excruciating pain all over his body as if he was about to be torn apart.</p><p>At this time, the nine suns Supreme Master waved his hand and closed the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. Only then did the terrifying aura disappear.</p><p>“Brat, don’t open it unless you’re strong enough. Otherwise, you won’t even know how you’re going to die.”</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns shouted coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming broke out in a cold sweat. This was only a secret manual. It was too terrifying, right?</p><p>kid, this manual contains a trace of the nine Dragons ‘Qi. Ordinary people can’t withstand it. Also, with your current cultivation and physical strength, you can’t practice the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps at all. You can only start practicing it when you break through the first realm of martial ancestor realm and your physical strength reaches the fourth grade.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns warned.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming carefully put away the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, but he sighed in his heart.</p><p>The requirements were too high.</p><p>It was still alright to break through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm. Lu Ming believed that he would be able to break through soon. However, it would not be so easy to reach the fourth-grade physical body.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s physical body had reached the third-grade, it was very difficult for him to break through to the fourth-grade.</p><p>First of all, he had to have a technique that could allow him to cultivate his body to the fourth stage. At the same time, he also needed an opportunity. Otherwise, he might not be able to break through in several years.</p><p>I must meet these conditions as soon as possible.</p><p>Holding a god level martial skill but not being able to cultivate it was not a good feeling.</p><p>alright, next, I’ll help you conceal the aura of the nine dragon blood essence. Sit tight, relax your mind, and control the bloodline to appear.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns instructed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sat down cross-legged. His body glowed as his spirit-devouring bloodline, no, it should be called the nine Dragons bloodline, emerged and floated quietly above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>let’s go! the nine suns Supreme Master shouted. His body emitted endless light, and a sun appeared above his head. After a few breaths, another sun appeared.</p><p>In the next minute, a total of nine suns appeared around the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>The nine suns hovered around the nine suns Supreme, like the gods of the sun.</p><p>“Suppress, seal!”</p><p>Nine Dragons bloodline! nine suns Supreme Master shouted. The nine suns emitted endless light, which then rushed toward the nine Dragon bloodlines and covered them, forming a seal that sealed the aura of the nine Dragon bloodlines.</p><p>Half an hour later, the nine suns around nine suns Supreme Master suddenly disappeared. Nine suns Supreme master’s body trembled and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>“Senior, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly stood up and supported nine suns cosmos.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme master’s face was pale, and his body had become much fainter, as if he would dissipate at any time.</p><p>sealing the bloodline of the nine Dragons requires a huge amount of energy. After I help you seal it, you will fall into a deep sleep not long after. Once you fall into a deep sleep, I don’t know when you will wake up again.</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns heaved a long sigh.</p><p>“Senior, Lu Ming is unable to repay senior’s kindness.”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to the nine suns Supreme with sincerity.</p><p>you just need to avenge me. Also, I have to tell you something seriously. I can help you seal the aura of the nine Dragon bloodline, but only for ten years. After ten years, my sealing power will dissipate. At that time, Di Yi and Martial Emperor will sense you.</p><p>so, you only have ten years. In these ten years, you must keep breaking through and growing. At least, you must have the ability to escape from Di Yi’s pursuit. Otherwise, everything will be over.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme martial artist said solemnly.</p><p>ten years, only ten years? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Don’t you have the confidence?” Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>of course. Ten years. That’s enough time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a trace of fighting spirit.</p><p>“Good! Now, I’ll subdue that blood demon while I’m at it. After all, you’re still inside its body.”</p><p>The Martial Emperor of nine suns muttered. A wave of fluctuation was emitted from his body and he disappeared. Then, a blood-colored token appeared in his hand.</p><p>He passed the blood-red token to Lu Ming and said,”This is the demon suppressing token. You can use it to control the blood Devils. Alright, I’ve said all that I need to say. From now on, you’ll have to depend on yourself.”</p><p>After saying that, nine suns Supreme Master staggered toward the main hall.</p><p>“Senior, if Lu Ming’s cultivation is successful in the future, I’ll definitely think of a way to save you.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Save me? Even a Martial Emperor can’t do it. ”</p><p>Supreme Master of the nine suns sighed, then walked into the hall and disappeared.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
