Obviously, he had gained a lot during this period of time.</p><p>The emperor’s birthday was in half a month’s time. Lu Ming planned to ask about his father’s condition.</p><p>He walked out of the general Star Hall and onto the street, heading toward the Imperial Palace.</p><p>At this time, the people on the street suddenly looked up at the sky in unison and started discussing.</p><p>“Who is that person? You’re actually so bold, daring to fly above the imperial capital so brazenly.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Ordinary martial arts Grandmaster powerhouses were forbidden from flying in the sky above the imperial capital. Only Overlord-level figures were not restricted by this restriction.</p><p>Now, someone actually dared to do this?</p><p>Lu Ming also looked up.</p><p>In the sky, a young figure in his twenties, wearing a red robe, was Walking in the Air towards the depths of the imperial capital.</p><p>“It’s Ling Yanchi, one of the six heroes, Ling Yanchi!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“What? It’s actually Ling Yanchi?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>It was Ling Yanchi, the strongest of the younger generation in the blazing sun Empire’s five major sects, the Crimson Cloud Valley. He was one of the six heroes of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first time meeting the six heroes of the scorching sun.</p><p>“Brother Ling, wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a soft shout came from behind. Then, a white-robed young man with a handsome face stepped through the air.</p><p>“It’s Feng Wuji, Feng Wuji from the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>“Another one of the six heroes!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>He is Feng Wuji!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard of Feng Wuji’s name countless times in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Feng Wuji was the pride of the mystical sword sect’s younger generation. He was the strongest among his peers.</p><p>Although Duanmu Lin was known as a peerless genius, he was still young and couldn’t compete with Feng Wuji.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in the mystical sword sect for more than a year and this was the first time he had seen her in person.</p><p>“Brother Feng, you’ve come so quickly. Let’s go together!”</p><p>Ling Yanchi smiled and waited for Feng Wuji to arrive. The two of them then disappeared into the sky.</p><p>my God, two of the six heroes of the scorching sun are here today. This is rare.</p><p>that’s right. It’s usually extremely difficult to even see one. Now, there are two of them.</p><p>“His Majesty the emperor’s sixtieth birthday is approaching. No matter what, the five great sects have to put on a show. They’ll definitely gather in the imperial capital, and it’s inevitable that the geniuses of the five great sects will gather.”</p><p>“Will the six heroes gather and start a competition? I’m really looking forward to it. ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. Among the six heroes, Qiu changkong is unrivaled, but the other five have never fought. I wonder who’s stronger.</p><p>“It would be great if there was a peak confrontation this time.”</p><p>On the streets, countless people were discussing.</p><p>As for not being able to fly in the imperial capital, that was directly ignored by them.</p><p>If the six heroes of the scorching sun couldn’t fly in the Imperial City, who else could?</p><p>They were the future overlords of the burning sun Empire. In the future, the entire burning sun Empire would be theirs.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything and continued on his way to the palace. However, there was a sharp glint in his eyes.</p><p>He would reach the height of the scorching sun’s six heroes sooner or later, and even surpass them.</p><p>He successfully entered the Imperial Palace and saw Hua Chi.</p><p>Unfortunately, even though the royal family had mobilized a large number of manpower, there was still no news of his father, Lu Yuntian. Lu Ming sighed and could only wait.</p><p>After discussing the current situation with Hua Chi, Lu Ming left the palace.</p><p>When he arrived at the gate of the general Star Hall, he discovered that a large number of students had gathered there and were currently dispersing.</p><p>“Tianyun, he’s back.”</p><p>damn it, why didn’t he appear earlier? it’s all his fault!</p><p>Mumbling sounds came from the students all around.</p><p>Of course, his voice was very soft as he was afraid that Lu Ming would hear him.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun!”</p><p>At this moment, Ming Feng came over.</p><p>“Ming Feng, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, it’s the Shifang Sword School. Just now, a disciple of the Shifang Sword School came and threatened to cripple you. However, you weren’t here, so everyone said you were in seclusion. Those disciples of the Shifang Sword School injured more than ten students of the general stars Hall. They were extremely arrogant.”</p><p>Ming Feng whispered.</p><p>“It’s the ten direction Sword School again!”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>big brother tianyun, I think you’d better avoid them for now. I heard that there are geniuses on the silver list among the disciples of the ten directions Sword School. They’re at the peak of the great Martial Master realm and are extremely powerful.</p><p>Ming Feng said worriedly.</p><p>“If they come again, inform me!”</p><p>Lu Ming left a sentence in an extremely domineering manner and then headed back to the dormitory.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming stayed in the dormitory and cultivated various martial arts techniques on the third platform of the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Time flew by and half a month passed.</p><p>In this half a month, a storm had gathered in the imperial capital, and the geniuses of the five great sects had all gathered.</p><p>Not only were there master realm geniuses, but there were also Grandmaster realm geniuses and even gold disciples from various sects.</p><p>However, in this half a month, although all the sects had gathered, it had been very calm.</p><p>Even the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect did not come looking for Lu Ming again.</p><p>However, everyone felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right. It was like the calm before the storm, and it was unusually depressing.</p><p>Half a month later, the 60th birthday of the Emperor of the burning sun Empire, Hua Zhengxing, was just the beginning.</p><p>Early in the morning, Hua Chi came to pick Lu Ming up in a beast carriage.</p><p>Together with Hua Chi, they arrived at the Imperial Palace.</p><p>The birthday banquet was held in the front yard of the Imperial Palace. It occupied a large area, but only a few dozen tables were placed.</p><p>Because those who could come here were all of high status, there were not many people.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Hua Chi and sat at a table on the right.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people slowly increased.</p><p>Hua Chi’s siblings, concubines, nobles, and ministers all sat down.</p><p>“The valley master and the elders of the Scarlet cloud Valley have arrived.”</p><p>A loud shout reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>All the princes, princesses, concubines, and ministers changed their expressions and stood up.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to be too special and got up as well.</p><p>At the main entrance, a group of six people walked in with majestic steps.</p><p>The leader was a middle-aged man with a full beard. He was wearing a red robe and had a burly figure.</p><p>His gaze swept across the crowd, and everyone felt as if a vast ocean was surging towards them. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Behind him, there were four old men who were also wearing red robes, but their red robes were inlaid with gold.</p><p>He was the Golden-robed elder of the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>The last one was a young man. He was one of the six heroes, Ling Yanchi.</p><p>“Greetings, Scarlet cloud Valley master.”</p><p>All of the concubines, princes, nobles, and ministers saluted the valley master.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how much the imperial family had declined. They were still very respectful to the five great sects.</p><p>“Haha, no need to be so polite. Where’s His Majesty? has he not arrived yet?”</p><p>The Scarlet heaven Valley master laughed and sat down on a chair.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
