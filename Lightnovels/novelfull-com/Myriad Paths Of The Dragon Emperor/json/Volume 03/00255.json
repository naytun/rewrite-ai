Do you think the royal family will take you seriously if you attack sect master Qiu in the palace?”</p><p>Heaven suppression King shouted.</p><p>Many people looked down on him. Qiu Wuyang was the one who didn’t take the royal family seriously. He had humiliated the royal family like that, but the heavenly suppression King didn’t say anything.</p><p>But now, he jumped out and used the name of the royal family to suppress Lin Xueyi and the others.</p><p>How despicable and shameless.</p><p>“Good, good, very good. Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang said ‘good’ a few times. His eyes were extremely cold as he glanced at Lin Xueyi, the valley master, and the others. Finally, he looked at Hua Zhengxing and said,”Hua Zhengxing, you, take care!”</p><p>His voice was cold, and the threat was extremely obvious.</p><p>With that, he waved his hand and stepped into the air, leaving first.</p><p>The other people from the ten directions sword sect followed closely behind.</p><p>brother, you don’t understand the bigger picture. The Hua family will be destroyed in your hands sooner or later!</p><p>The Heavenly King glared at Hua Zhengxing in anger.</p><p>“General trend? The general trend is to make the entire Hua family submit to the Shifang Sword School and become their slaves?”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing said as he looked at the Heavenly King mockingly.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The Heavenly King’s expression turned ugly. He snorted heavily and left with Hua Jie and the others.</p><p>However, before he left, the Heavenly King glanced at Lu Ming, making Lu Ming’s hair stand on end.</p><p>It was a blatant killing intent.</p><p>“Your Majesty, I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>The sect master laughed and bade his farewells, leaving with the rest of the heavenly fiend sect.</p><p>Only three of the five great sects were left.</p><p>The birthday banquet continued. However, regardless of whether it was Hua Zhengxing, Lin Xueyi, or the other three sect leaders, their faces were unusually serious.</p><p>Today, Qiu Wuyang had suddenly proposed to establish the sun Alliance, and heavenly fiend sect had even agreed to it.</p><p>They guessed that the heavenfiend sect had most likely joined forces with the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>This was a major event, and the balance of power in the burning sun Empire was about to be broken.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire was about to enter an eventful period.</p><p>The atmosphere of the birthday banquet was very depressing. Not long after, the three major sects also took their leave.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming also got up and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve seen what happened today. The omnipresent sword sect is simply too ambitious and lawless,”</p><p>Hua Chi sent Lu Ming to the entrance of the palace and said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming patted Hua Chi’s shoulder and returned to the general Star Hall without saying anything.</p><p>After returning to the general stars Hall, Lu Ming sat on his bed. His thoughts were in a mess and he could not calm down.</p><p>Today’s emperor’s birthday banquet allowed him to truly see the dark and turbulent situation in the burning sun Empire.</p><p>He had a feeling that the blazing sun Empire was about to fall into chaos. In the near future, a terrifying storm would probably be brewing.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was already deeply involved in the whirlpool because of his friends and family, and it was difficult for him to stay out of it.</p><p>The only thing he could do now was to improve his strength as much as possible. Without strength, he would only be crushed into dust in this storm.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths, adjusted his mood, and began to cultivate.</p><p>Somewhere in the imperial capital, there was a group of extremely luxurious palaces, even more luxurious than the Imperial Palace. This was the residence of the ten direction Sword School in the imperial capital.</p><p>In a large hall in the depths of the palace, Qiu Wuyang sat at the head of the table. Below him were the Golden-robed elders of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang slammed the table and said with a gloomy face, ” “Mystic essence sword sect, Crimson Cloud Valley, and ghostmoon saber sect. I knew that they wouldn’t agree. A bunch of damn things.”</p><p>sect leader, especially that Lin Xueyi, they have been targeting the sect leader at every turn. They even dared to fight with the sect leader. They are overestimating themselves.</p><p>A golden-robed elder said.</p><p>“Hmph! Lin Xueyi, the mystical sword sect won’t be arrogant for long.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang sneered.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang pondered for a moment and said, ” it’s time to let them know the strength of our ten direction Sword School. Pass down my order. Let the younger generation attack first. Let them know how weak their so-called geniuses are.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Golden-robed elders acknowledged in unison.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, a piece of news swept through the entire Imperial City like a storm.</p><p>Guan Hong, one of the six heroes of the ten directions sword sect, challenged Feng Wuji of the mystical sword sect and Ling Yanchi of the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>The location was at the highest peak of the imperial capital, the peak of Sunset Peak.</p><p>Once the news spread, everyone went crazy.</p><p>Other than the Shifang Sword School, the other four major sects each had one member of the scorching sun’s six heroes.</p><p>Only the ten direction Sword School had two.</p><p>One of them was Qiu changkong, and the other was Guan Hong.</p><p>Qiu changkong, the leader of the six heroes, was incomparably powerful. There was no doubt that he was able to suppress the other five.</p><p>As for the other five, they had never fought each other before, so no one knew who was stronger.</p><p>Now, was it finally time to fight?</p><p>Countless people swarmed towards setting sun Peak, hoping to witness the battle between the six heroes.</p><p>When Lu Ming ended his three-day closed-door cultivation and walked out of his room, he saw Ming Feng rushing in.</p><p>“Mingfeng, what’s the rush?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, let’s go to Sunset Peak. The battle between the six heroes is about to begin. Guan Hong is challenging Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi. My big brother and the others have already rushed over and told me to come and find you. If we don’t go now, it will be too late.”</p><p>Ming Feng panted.</p><p>“A battle between the six heroes?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Then, his eyes lit up. He grabbed the bright peak and took a step forward. He was already fifty meters away. Only one word was heard.”Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed Ming Feng and used the high flight step. He was as fast as the wind and rushed toward setting sun Peak.</p><p>Sunset Peak was located in the Western part of the imperial capital.</p><p>When Lu Ming neared Sunset Peak, he saw a shocking scene.</p><p>From all directions, countless silhouettes formed into long Dragons that rushed towards setting sun Peak.</p><p>There were so many people that it was impossible to distinguish them.</p><p>Among them, there were even martial arts Grandmaster powerhouses.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the crowd and quickly approached Sunset Peak.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying rumble was heard from the peak of Sunset Peak.</p><p>“The war has started, Guan Hong and Feng Wuji have started their war.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One figure after another began to climb up setting sun Peak.</p><p>Lu Ming held onto the bright peak as if it was weightless. He stepped on a piece of green grass and his figure shot forward for hundreds of meters, approaching the peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the mountaintop, the rumbling sounds continued. Lu Ming looked up and saw two figures charging at each other in the sky above the mountain. The sword Qi was shocking and the terrifying shock waves were surging outwards.</p><p>A suffocating pressure filled the air.</p><p>“What powerful battle prowess.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>With his eye of discernment, he could naturally tell that one of them was Feng Wuji of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The other man was tall and had a wild aura. The sword in his hand was an extremely wide giant sword. He must be Guan Hong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. In just a few minutes, he had reached the peak.</p><p>At this moment, Guan Hong and Feng Wuji had already exchanged a few hundred moves.</p><p>“Feng Wuji, admit your defeat!”</p><p>Guan Hong let out a long cry, and then slashed out a shocking sword light.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
