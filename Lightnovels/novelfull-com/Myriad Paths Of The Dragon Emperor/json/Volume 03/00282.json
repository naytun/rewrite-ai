That guy is waiting for us outside. No matter which direction we go, he will probably chase us.”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked up at the sky and frowned.</p><p>“Why do we have to go out? we can just cultivate here.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He leaped onto the pit and sat cross-legged at the side.</p><p>“Cultivate here?”</p><p>Xie nianqing was in disbelief.</p><p>“Trust me,”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was transmitted to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing was skeptical. However, on second thought, Lu Ming had never been at a disadvantage before. Perhaps he really had a way.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xie nianqing decided to go all out. He sat down cross-legged, took out a handful of blood refining crystals, swallowed them, and began refining them.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and took a look at the sky. He took out a handful of blood refining crystals and swallowed them, starting to refine them.</p><p>In the sky, Zhao Hong was dumbfounded.</p><p>“He’s actually refining blood crystals here? Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Zhao Hong roared in his heart, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>In his opinion, all the blood refining crystals here belonged to him. Now that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were refining his blood refining crystals, it was a heinous crime.</p><p>However, he was still hesitant and did not go over.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had refined a handful of blood refining crystals and took out another handful to refine.</p><p>One after another, it did not take long for Lu Ming to refine hundreds of blood refining crystals. Xie nianqing was about the same.</p><p>“That golden-eyed blood corpse hasn’t appeared yet, so it should be fine. Smash it and die!”</p><p>Zhao Hong growled and flew toward Lu Ming. In a short while, he was close to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is it finally here?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He did not care and continued to cultivate.</p><p>Xie nianqing was shocked and stood up to block.</p><p>“Little bastard, die!”</p><p>die! Zhao Hong roared and was about to slash down with his saber.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the pit as the Golden-eyed blood corpse charged out and attacked Zhao Hong.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Caught off guard, Zhao Hong was hit by the Golden-eyed blood Zombie’s claw. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his body flew far away.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse quickly charged towards Zhao Hong.</p><p>“What’s going on? How did this happen? Those two B * stards have been here for so long, collecting refined blood crystals and refining them. The Golden-eyed blood corpse didn’t even rush out, so why did it rush out as soon as I arrived? I’m not convinced!”</p><p>Zhao Hong roared in his heart.</p><p>But he didn’t dare to stay, so he turned and ran.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie clawed at Zhao Hong’s pants, leaving a huge hole in his pants. Zhao Hong’s snow-white butt was writhing in the air.</p><p>“Hey! Your butt is out again, haha, eh? Why did I say again?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red. He snorted and turned around.</p><p>”</p><p>Zhao Hong let out a long cry, his hair was in a mess and his aura was shocking. However, he was met with the claw of the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The claw ray swept past and left five wounds on Zhao Hong’s body. It was as if he had been cut by a blade, and blood was dripping from his body.</p><p>Zhao Hong spat out a mouthful of blood. He was already injured and his speed had decreased. He could no longer escape from the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>“If we’re going to die, we’ll die together!”</p><p>Zhao Hong howled and dashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and looked at him with a faint smile.</p><p>A scene that made Zhao Hong vomit blood appeared. When the Golden-eyed blood zombie rushed past Lu Ming, it did not even look at Lu Ming and continued to pursue him.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Zhao Hong bellowed in anger. He was unwilling and confused.</p><p>However, it was useless. The Golden-eyed blood corpse quickly caught up to him. No matter how talented he was, he was still torn in half by the Golden-eyed blood corpse after a few moves.</p><p>Zhao Hong, one of the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao Empire, a genius on the same level as the scorching sun’s six heroes, had died just like that in a state of unwillingness, doubt, and humiliation.</p><p>His blood and essence were all converted into blood refining crystals.</p><p>81 blood refining crystals. Zhao Hong had refined a total of 81 blood refining crystals.</p><p>His second bloodline was a first-level King bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all of them, including Zhao Hong’s blood refining crystals.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse growled and appeared beside Lu Ming. It stood there obediently.</p><p>Xie nianqing was dumbfounded. She stared at him for a while and suddenly remembered that the powerful blood demon had also been obedient to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you have any way to subdue the demonic creature?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>“Didn’t I already tell you? I’m a proud son of the heavens and am blessed by the heavens. These demonic creatures will naturally be submissive when they see me!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a smug look on his face. He sized up Xie nianqing and said,”How is it? Are you tempted? Why don’t you be my bed-warming maid? If you follow me, you’ll have endless benefits.”</p><p>Lu Ming had a smug look.</p><p>“Warm your head, Hmph! I guess you must have some kind of treasure that can subdue demons. No way, one day, I will step on you.”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted coldly, turned his proud neck, and went to the side to refine the blood refining crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and instructed the Golden-eyed blood corpse to stand guard at the side. He then took out Zhao Hong’s storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming put the rest aside and took out all the blood refining crystals.</p><p>There were more than 500 blood refining crystals in Zhao Hong’s storage ring. This meant that at least a few hundred young experts had died at Zhao Hong’s hands.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming benefited from it.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing focused on refining the blood crystals.</p><p>During this time, other young men came, but they were scared away by the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two days passed.</p><p>Lu Ming refined more than three thousand blood refining crystals.</p><p>In total, Lu Ming had refined more than six thousand blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s spine was glowing with a thick blood-red light. The blood Qi seemed to have substance and was about to turn into drops of blood.</p><p>that’s enough. Now, break through the martial arts Grandmaster realm and awaken the second bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He waved his hand and hundreds of thousands of spiritual crystals appeared beside him.</p><p>After that, he circulated the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>The vortex in his dantian spun rapidly, and the Dragon-shaped true Qi in his body surged. At his spine, his blood vessels surged, and his blood Qi exploded.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s essence, energy, and spirit were condensed to the extreme.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a deafening roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. A surge of essence energy surged up and soared into the clouds.</p><p>Within a radius of dozens of miles, countless young experts looked over.</p><p>the Qi is soaring to the sky. Someone has broken through to Wu Zong!</p><p>what a terrifying aura. This kind of power is too shocking. What kind of genius is he? ”</p><p>when I broke through to Wu Zong, my essence Qi was less than one-fifth of his. How terrifying!</p><p>Many people were discussing and some even rushed over, but with the Golden-eyed blood corpse, they couldn’t step in.</p><p>There were even some who wanted to force their way in but were killed by the Golden-eyed blood zombies. The others didn’t dare to force their way in anymore.</p><p>The pillar of essence Qi only disappeared after a long while.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons bloodline appeared. He opened his mouth and inhaled. Large pieces of spirit crystals exploded and were devoured by the nine Dragons bloodline, continuously transforming into Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>The essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body continued to strengthen and improve.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
