However, he knew that there were a few powerful figures watching him from the clouds. Hence, he did not dare to go overboard.</p><p>Hua Jie was stunned. He could not refute Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>“How about this, Hua Jie, I’ll give you a chance. All of you, come at me together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>What?</p><p>There was an uproar at the scene. Lu Ming actually wanted the people brought by Hua Jie to attack together?</p><p>This was too arrogant. One should know that the people beside Hua Jie were all geniuses. They were the children of many influential figures in the Imperial City and were very powerful.</p><p>Some of them were even stronger than Chen Xiong. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, how could he be a match for so many experts?</p><p>This was crazy! This was crazy!</p><p>“What? You want to challenge so many of us?”</p><p>Even Hua Jie himself was stunned for a moment. Then, he reacted and revealed a look of ecstasy on his face. He hurriedly shouted,”Alright, you said it, don’t go back on your word!”</p><p>At the same time, he laughed in his heart. He was laughing at Lu Ming for courting death.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the middle-aged elder was a little stunned. This was the first time he had seen such a scene during a test. For a moment, he did not know whether to agree or not.</p><p>At this moment, a voice transmission entered his ears, asking him to agree.</p><p>It was a voice transmission from an elder above the clouds. They wanted to take the opportunity to observe Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, this battle can proceed!” The middle-aged elder announced.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Hua Jie hurriedly waved his hand, and more than a dozen young men beside him rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Brat, do you think you can be so arrogant just because you defeated Chen Xiong? You’re really naive!”</p><p>he’s actually challenging so many of us at once. He’s simply courting death!</p><p>“If I don’t beat him up, I’m not a Wang!”</p><p>…</p><p>These young men glared at Lu Ming with hostility and sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming had challenged so many of them at once. It was obvious that he was looking down on them. It was an insult. They wanted to make Lu Ming regret it.</p><p>cut the crap. If you want to make a move, do it now. If you don’t, get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Damn it, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>…</p><p>The dozen or so young men let out angry roars, and their bodies emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A blood-red light flashed and the blood of the dozen youths burst out at the same time. A terrifying attack surged toward Lu Ming like a never-ending tide.</p><p>Lu Ming was instantly drowned by the colorful brilliance.</p><p>Everyone stared with their eyes wide open. Lu Ming was so arrogant. They wanted to see how Lu Ming would fight against more than ten young geniuses.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move.</p><p>Just like before, he didn’t even draw his weapon. With a brilliant glow, a spear materialized in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear swept out in a very direct and violent way. A full moon appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a loud boom, the attacks of the dozen or so young men were instantly dispersed. The terrifying spear light whizzed out and swept in all directions.</p><p>“Ah!” Achoo!</p><p>ah! more than a dozen screams sounded out as more than a dozen figures were thrown out of the fighting ring and coughed up blood.</p><p>It was frozen. The air seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>Everyone looked at this scene in a daze.</p><p>One move, it was still just one move, and the dozen or so young geniuses that Hua Jie had brought with him were all defeated.</p><p>He loosened his grip gently, as if he was chasing away a dozen flies.</p><p>“What a waste of time!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming pursed his lips and said.</p><p>Everyone was speechless. They were roaring in their hearts. What do you mean by wasting time? you’re the one who’s too abnormal, okay?</p><p>You can’t attack people like this!</p><p>Hua Jie’s body trembled. His face was pale and his lips were trembling. He pointed at Lu Ming and said,”You, you coward!”</p><p>He couldn’t say a word.</p><p>strong, he’s too strong! Big brother tianyun is too strong!</p><p>Ming Feng muttered to himself, his face filled with excitement.</p><p>At the side, Mingzhu’s beautiful eyes also flickered with extraordinary splendor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had completely exceeded her expectations.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>Above the clouds, a few old men let out a long breath, their eyes flickering.</p><p>“How is it? Can you tell what their origins are?”</p><p>One of the old men asked.</p><p>I can’t tell. It was just one move, and most of them were swept by absolute power. Very little information was exposed!</p><p>“Furthermore, what he used was most likely a personal martial technique that he had obtained himself. There are no traces of the five great sects.”</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>this is difficult. Is such a peerless genius really from the five great sects? ”</p><p>pay attention, we must pay close attention. If it’s someone from the five great sects, they’re just here to use the sacred land to cultivate. They won’t be able to stay for long.</p><p>“If he isn’t, I must rope him in!”</p><p>The few elders quickly discussed.</p><p>“Elder, is my test over?” Lu Ming asked the middle-aged elder.</p><p>“The knot has ended!”</p><p>The middle-aged elder stuttered.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and jumped off the fighting ring.</p><p>Hua Jie glared at Lu Ming resentfully and left with more than ten young men who were staggering. They were in a sorry state.</p><p>Hua Jie would become a laughingstock once again if he came in a high-profile manner and left with a dejected face.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. As long as there were no elders, he did not care about a dandy like Hua Jie.</p><p>Then, the test continued, but there were no outstanding people.</p><p>Soon, all the tests were over. The middle-aged elder marked the identity Jade card of each new student.</p><p>haha, I can finally go to the seven cultivation sanctuaries to cultivate.</p><p>Ming Feng laughed.</p><p>“Mingfeng, are the seven cultivation sanctuaries really that good?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Good, of course it’s good. Big brother tianyun, do you know why there are disciples from the five great sects who managed to sneak in? He wants to enter the seven sacred lands of the general Star Hall to cultivate!”</p><p>Ming Feng’s eyes lit up.</p><p>brother Tian, the seven cultivation sanctuaries of the general stars Hall are the most important treasure lands of the royal family. It is said that the ten direction Sword School is very coveting them, but the royal family has them in their hands. It can be said that the seven cultivation sanctuaries are the foundation of the royal family. They can’t give them to anyone else!</p><p>Mingzhu also explained.</p><p>that’s right, big brother tianyun. You’ve defeated the senior students this time. Other than the earth Yuan cave, you can choose any of the other six places and train for free for a year. I’m so envious!</p><p>Ming Feng shouted.</p><p>“I wonder what are the seven cultivation sanctuaries?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ll say it!”</p><p>“The seven cultivation sanctuaries are earth essence cave, gengjin Valley, godwind Valley, no rest tower, ten thousand killing secret realm, foggy Marsh, and lightning Palace,” Ming Feng immediately said.</p><p>among them, the most mysterious one is the earth Yuan cave. Under the earth Yuan cave, there is a rich fire spiritual Qi that can be condensed into true Qi. In the earth Yuan cave, whether it is to improve cultivation or to practice fire attribute martial skills, it will be twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>“The gengjin Valley is filled with rich golden qi, and is the best place to cultivate metal attribute cultivation techniques and martial arts techniques.”</p><p>God Wind Valley is filled with strong winds and hurricanes, it is the best Gu for the wind attribute!</p><p>…</p><p>Ming Feng explained the characteristics of the seven cultivation Holy Lands one by one.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
