You’re still going to die.</p><p>Qiuming said with a dark expression.</p><p>The three Ming siblings went up to the grandstand while Lu Ming walked up to the battle stage in the middle.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming, who was on the fighting ring.</p><p>alright, now the tianyun challenge has officially begun. Who wants to come up for a fight? ”</p><p>The judge announced loudly.</p><p>“I’ll give it a try!”</p><p>An old man shouted as he stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>it’s a monster from mang mountain. He’s an eighth grade great master, and he’s won seven consecutive battles against his peers. He’s considered an expert even among the eighth grade great master realm, and he’s qualified to be tianyun’s first candidate.</p><p>As soon as the old man went up the stage, someone recognized him.</p><p>“You can fight!”</p><p>The judge nodded and acknowledged the strength of the monster of min mountain.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, please!”</p><p>The monster of Xiao Mountain fixed its gaze on Lu Ming, its body exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a long spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The monster of mang mountain took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind staff technique!”</p><p>The monster of Xiao Mountain bellowed. The Dragon-headed walking stick in his hand was like a whirlwind, striking at Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>The monster of mang mountain revealed his absolute strength as soon as he attacked. Even among eighth grade great martial masters, he was one of the top fighters.</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear and engaged in a fierce battle with the monster of Xiao Mountain.</p><p>He didn’t use his aura. Although the monster of mang mountain was quite strong, he didn’t need aura.</p><p>After more than ten moves, the monster from Xiao Mountain was sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>The defeat of the monster of Xiao Mountain was within everyone’s expectations.</p><p>However, the experts who would come up later would also become stronger and stronger. The real challenge had just begun.</p><p>“Who’s going to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’m coming to kill you!”</p><p>With a loud shout, a disciple of the ten directions Sword School jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>For a sect disciple like the ten direction sword sect, who could reach this level of cultivation at such a young age, they were all geniuses and almost didn’t need to test their strength.</p><p>tianyun, if you know what’s good for you, quickly return the primordial origin liquid to senior brother qiuming, then kneel down and apologize to the ten direction sword sect in front of everyone. If you do that, I’ll consider only crippling your cultivation and sparing your dog life.</p><p>The disciple of the ten directions sword sect shouted coldly. He was extremely arrogant and ashamed.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“F * ck, what did you say? You’re looking for death. Even if I kill you, your things will still be mine.” The disciple from the omnidirectional sword sect roared. His aura exploded as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It had to be said that this disciple of the ten directions Sword School was very strong, much stronger than the monster of mang mountain. No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>Unfortunately, his opponent was Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The force of the wind was fused into the spear, causing the speed of the spear to be extremely fast.</p><p>The crowd only saw the shadow of a spear flash, and in an instant, it appeared in front of the disciple of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the heart of the disciple from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions sword sect let out a blood-curdling scream and fell to the ground, no longer breathing.</p><p>One-shot kill!</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions Sword School was still extremely arrogant just a moment ago, but he was instantly killed.</p><p>he’s two levels higher than me, and yet he’s still able to insta-kill me with a single shot. Isn’t this tianyun way too strong? ”</p><p>the disciples of the ten direction Sword School aren’t weak. They’re the top experts even among the eighth grade great martial masters. Tianyun’s battle prowess is definitely equivalent to a ninth grade great Martial Master!</p><p>“This is too terrifying!”</p><p>can he really break the record of the six heroes of the scorching sun? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming had already won two rounds in a row, while the other five of the six heroes of the scorching sun had only won four rounds in a row.</p><p>Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A roar came from the disciples of the ten directions sword sect. A figure jumped high into the air and landed on the fighting ring, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>It was qiuming.</p><p>tianyun, your winning streak ends here. If you want to break the record of the six scorching sun heroes, it’s impossible!</p><p>Qiuming looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“You think you can stop me? Don’t end up like the one just now.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to him. Tianyun, you’ve repeatedly offended the might of my ten direction sword sect. Today, I’ll make sure you die an extremely miserable death.”</p><p>Qiuming said coldly. At the same time, the aura on his body grew stronger and stronger. Within the strong aura, there was a force, the force of gold!</p><p>I forgot to tell you something. I have refined all nine drops of primordial origin liquid.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly changed his tone and smiled.</p><p>“What? You, you, you!”</p><p>Qiuming’s face turned green and he almost lost his momentum.</p><p>The primordial origin liquid was of great use to him. The main reason why he wanted to kill Lu Ming was to snatch the primordial origin liquid.</p><p>However, Lu Ming said that the innate original fluid had been refined.</p><p>Qiuming’s eyes turned red and he roared in anger, ” “Tianyun, you deserve to die! You deserve to die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and an extremely dazzling sword Qi slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword Qi was infused with the force of metal, making it extremely sharp and indestructible.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and he used the force of the wind to attack qiuming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heavens and earth rumbled, and the fighting ring kept shaking. Terrifying air waves rushed in all directions.</p><p>The first move was a tie.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Qiuming’s attack missed and he launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>Qiuming’s combat strength was absolutely terrifying. In terms of talent, he was not as good as yang Zaitian, but his cultivation was much higher than yang Zaitian’s. Similarly, his combat strength was also much higher than yang Zaitian’s.</p><p>It was not difficult for qiuming to kill an opponent of a higher level.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than 20 moves in a row, causing the space to tremble.</p><p>qiuming’s combat strength is too strong. He shouldn’t have appeared in the third Battle. He’s trying to stop tianyun from winning.</p><p>that’s right. From the looks of it, tianyun has the ability to break the records of the other five out of the six scorching sun heroes. It’s a pity that he was stopped by qiuming.</p><p>as long as tianyun defeats qiuming, there won’t be any problem for him to break the five heroes record!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>“Is this your true strength? I’m so disappointed!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly said indifferently.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qiuming was stunned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body exploded like a volcano.</p><p>An incomparably powerful aura burst out.</p><p>It was the combination of fire and wind, erupting with a terrifying power.</p><p>A long spear broke through all the obstacles and stabbed toward qiuming.</p><p>This spear attack could not be dodged or blocked because it was too fast and too powerful.</p><p>“I’m not afraid.”</p><p>Qiuming was scared out of his wits. He roared crazily and used all his strength to resist.</p><p>However, they were all unnecessary. The long spear pierced through his heart.</p><p>The true energy on the spear burst forth, crushing his heart into pieces.</p><p>Qiuming was dead!</p><p>The audience was stunned for a few seconds, then burst into an earth-shattering uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed qiuming and achieved three consecutive wins. However, the strength that he had displayed was too terrifying. If there were no other terrifying geniuses, Lu Ming would definitely break the five heroes record. He might even break Qiu changkong’s record.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
