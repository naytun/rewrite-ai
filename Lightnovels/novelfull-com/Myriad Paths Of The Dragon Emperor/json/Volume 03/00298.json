He had an extraordinary bearing, and his eyes revealed a faint arrogance.</p><p>At the same time, he revealed a look of dissatisfaction.</p><p>Originally, he had thought that he would be the Commander-in-Chief this time, but unexpectedly, it had been given to someone else, which made him very unhappy.</p><p>Your Majesty, I suggest that we change senior brother Huaying to be the Commander-in-Chief. Senior brother Huaying is well-versed in military tactics and has a profound cultivation. He will definitely lead the Army and win every battle!</p><p>The young man from before saluted Hua Zhengxing and suggested.</p><p>“A hundred victories? I don’t know where this brat came from, but he actually wants to take the position of Commander-in-Chief. What a joke!”</p><p>Among the seven martial arts grandmasters of the star cluster Hall, someone was unconvinced and sneered.</p><p>The royal family had always treated the star cluster Hall as the leader. The seven of them were the strongest experts in the star cluster Hall. Where did those three brats come from? How was it possible for him to covet the position of Commander-in-Chief the moment he arrived?</p><p>How could the young expert from the star cluster Hall possibly agree?</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>The young man who had been suggesting Hua Ying to be the Commander-in-Chief looked at the star cluster Hall’s people with a dark expression.</p><p>His name was Gao Li, and he had a very good relationship with Hua Ying.</p><p>“Did you not hear what I said? I said that he doesn’t have the qualifications to be the commander. If he wants to be the commander, he’s a genius of my star cluster Hall!”</p><p>That person from the star cluster Hall continued to speak.</p><p>“A genius from the star cluster Hall? Haha, I’m dying of laughter. A few trash-like things dare to call themselves geniuses. It’s really laughable!”</p><p>Gawain laughed in disdain.</p><p>“Who are you calling trash? Today, I’ll let you know my power!”</p><p>The young Man From The Star cluster Hall roared and a powerful aura burst out as he walked towards Gao Li.</p><p>“You want to fight? That’s just what I want!”</p><p>Gao Li’s figure moved and swept towards the other party, at the same time, he threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was as powerful as a mountain, and a powerful force spread out.</p><p>The young Man From The Star cluster Hall also shouted and struck out with his palm.</p><p>As the fist and palm collided, the young man from star cluster Hall let out a blood-curdling screech and his body flew out like a cannonball. He fell heavily on the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Second level of Wu Zong!”</p><p>The young Man From The Star cluster Hall shouted.</p><p>Hmph, a mere 1-stage martial ancestor realm wants to fight me? you’re really looking for death!</p><p>Gawain said coldly.</p><p>During this process, Hua Zhengxing did not stop him and just watched coldly.</p><p>He had already expected this outcome. As long as no one died, he would not care.</p><p>“Now, if you are unconvinced, feel free to attack!”</p><p>Gao Li was incomparably arrogant as he swept his gaze across everyone in the star cluster Hall.</p><p>Everyone from the star cluster Hall had an ugly expression as they could not help but look at a bald youth in the middle.</p><p>This bald young man was the number one expert in star cluster Hall, with a cultivation of the second level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>The bald young man stepped forward and stood opposite Gao Li.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was nothing much to say, and the battle immediately erupted.</p><p>It had to be said that Gao Li was indeed very strong. Although the bald youth was at the same level as him, he was no match for him at all. In just a dozen moves, he was sent flying and coughed out blood.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re indeed a bunch of trash. Still not admitting it? I can only say that you have not seen the world and have never seen the geniuses of a big country. You think that just because you are in a corner and have a little achievement, you are self-satisfied? How short-sighted are you? how can you improve like this?”</p><p>Gao Li had his hands behind his back as he looked down at the people of star cluster Hall and berated them with the tone of an elder disciplining a junior.</p><p>“Detestable! Where did these guys come from? how can they be so strong?”</p><p>The faces of everyone in the star cluster Hall turned red as they roared in their hearts. They were extremely aggrieved.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Gao Li let out a disdainful sneer and said, ” “Senior brother Huaying is much stronger than me. Why don’t you accept him as the Commander-in-Chief?”</p><p>of course not. A guy who stayed in a big country for a while and thinks he’s a genius has come back to show off his strength. What right does he have to be the commander? ”</p><p>At this time, a faint voice was heard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Gao Li’s face instantly turned ugly.</p><p>Huaying’s face darkened.</p><p>As for Hua Chi, a hint of joy flashed through his eyes when he heard this voice.</p><p>The owner of the voice was, of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>With his hands behind his back, Lu Ming walked towards them with Xie nianqing and the Golden-eyed blood corpse by his side.</p><p>“Kid, Who are you? How dare you talk to me like this?”</p><p>Gao Li stared at Lu Ming with a gloomy look.</p><p>“Tianyun, it’s tianyun!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, the young experts from the star cluster Hall could not help but exclaim.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said,”Who am I?” I’m the Commander-in-Chief this time. You still don’t kneel and pay your respects when you see the Commander-in-Chief. Don’t you understand military law?”</p><p>“Commander? You’re the Commander-in-Chief? Ridiculous, ridiculous, I can’t accept this!”</p><p>Gao Li shouted, then turned to Hua Zhengxing and saluted, ” “Your Majesty, the Commander-in-Chief this time is no small matter. How can you let such a young boy take up the position? I’m not convinced!”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing’s face was calm, and no expression could be seen. He said,”Tianyun is someone that I have my eyes on. What’s there to be unconvinced about?”</p><p>“Your Majesty, the position of a commander is no small matter. Only the capable can take it. If we let an incompetent person become the commander, it will harm these tens of thousands of soldiers!”</p><p>Gawain said.</p><p>I agree to let tianyun be the Commander-in-Chief. I’m convinced that tianyun will be the Commander-in-Chief!</p><p>Suddenly, a young man from star cluster Hall shouted.</p><p>“I also agree to let tianyun be the commander!”</p><p>“I also agree. I’m convinced!”</p><p>The other young men from star cluster Hall also chimed in.</p><p>Tianyun had killed Qiu changlie some time ago, and he was extremely powerful. They were all convinced of his strength.</p><p>However, Gao Li and the others had just returned from the blood Zhao Empire and had not heard of tianyun’s name.</p><p>At this moment, Gao Li’s face was extremely gloomy as he said coldly, ” a bunch of frogs in a well. They’ve never seen a real genius, so they can only regard trash as geniuses.</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming. kid, if you want to be a commander, you have to be capable. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.</p><p>With that, a powerful aura emanated from his body and he slowly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>you talk too much. Hurry up and attack, or you won’t have the chance.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>Gao Li was furious. He shouted and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>The powerful fist force almost penetrated the void. He had used all his strength in this punch. He was determined to teach Lu Ming an unforgettable lesson.</p><p>However, Lu Ming completely ignored his fist force. He took a step forward and the ground cracked. Lu Ming’s figure instantly appeared in front of Gao Li and kicked him.</p><p>This kick landed directly on Gao Li’s stomach.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Gao Li let out a blood-curdling screech as he was sent flying by Lu Ming’s kick. He flew thousands of meters away and crashed heavily into a huge rock.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>This included the star cluster Hall’s heroes and the 20000 strong Army present.</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming was very powerful, the visual effect was too shocking.</p><p>The second level martial arts Grandmaster genius was sent flying by Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>“This is what it means to cultivate in a big country? A genius who had seen the world? It’s not much?”</p><p>Lu Ming slowly retracted his leg and said indifferently.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Hua Chi couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>Some people from the star cluster Hall almost laughed out loud.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
