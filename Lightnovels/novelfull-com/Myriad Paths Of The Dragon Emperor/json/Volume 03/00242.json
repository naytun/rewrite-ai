Just now, he had given the burly man a few words of guidance and allowed him to have a breakthrough in his martial arts technique. This made the old man’s heart burn with passion.</p><p>“WOWO, Xiang mu is too cunning. He’s one step ahead of me. Damn it, don’t fight with me. It’s my turn to challenge him next.”</p><p>“Your turn? Why? Young master tianyun is using a spear, and so am I. It’s my turn to fight in the next round.”</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>On the grandstand, a few sixth grade great Martial Master experts were actually fighting over it.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>These people were fighting to challenge Lu Ming, not because he was too weak, but because he was too strong. Such a thing was simply unheard of.</p><p>Lu Ming was also in a daze.</p><p>But this way, he was not worried that no one would accept his challenge.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said to the old man.</p><p>“Please give me some pointers!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the old man cupped his fists and then a long sword appeared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword-light tore through the air and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Just like before, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to fight back. He dodged with his movement technique and observed the old man’s swordsmanship at the same time.</p><p>After more than thirty moves, Lu Ming’s casual spear attack broke the elder’s swordsmanship and he retreated rapidly, just like the burly man earlier.</p><p>However, the old man was not dejected. Instead, he looked at Lu Ming with excitement and hope.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Then, according to what he had observed and his own understanding, he explained the flaws and shortcomings of the elder’s swordsmanship.</p><p>After the elder heard this, he savored it carefully and was overjoyed. His face was filled with excitement as he bowed respectfully to Lu Ming and said,”This old man thanks young master tianyun for his guidance.”</p><p>“There’s no need to be so polite, senior.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Then, the old man walked down the fighting ring, satisfied.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, I’ve come to ask for your guidance.”</p><p>As soon as the old man got off the stage, a burly man rushed up.</p><p>“I’ll do it, it’s my turn,”</p><p>On the other side, there were also people who rushed to the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s my turn. Get down.”</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost.”</p><p>The two of them bellowed, their killing intent bursting forth. It looked like a great battle was about to break out.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The surrounding crowd was dumbfounded. Lu Ming was in/similar state.</p><p>“Stop! If you want to challenge, then come one by one. Otherwise, I’ll cancel your right to challenge.”</p><p>The judge shouted, his face revealing a speechless expression.</p><p>He had managed the DI Tian battle arena for many years, but this was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p>“Judge, I was the one who challenged first?”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“Nonsense, it’s me!”</p><p>The other person didn’t give in either.</p><p>“Alright, you go first. You’re the last one.”</p><p>The judge pointed at the middle-aged man and said with a sullen face.</p><p>“Thank you, senior,” the middle-aged man was overjoyed.</p><p>The other person was a little unwilling and stood to the side.</p><p>The middle-aged man leaped onto the fighting ring and cupped his fists at Lu Ming. He said respectfully,”Young master tianyun, I’m also a spear user. Please advise me.”</p><p>After saying that, a long spear appeared in the middle-aged man’s hand.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>At that moment, the middle-aged burly man focused his mind and shook his long spear. More than ten spear flowers appeared in the air and rays of spear radiance shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did the same thing and dodged dozens of moves. He allowed the middle-aged burly man to perform his strongest martial arts technique and then easily defeated the other party, pointing out his weakness.</p><p>The middle-aged man was naturally ecstatic and left with a thousand thanks.</p><p>Next, another person came on stage and Lu Ming restrained him according to the law.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had achieved five consecutive victories.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s five-win streak was completely different from the others. Every time his opponents lost, they would leave in gratitude.</p><p>it seems like anything can really happen with tianyun.</p><p>Ming Cheng sighed.</p><p>Ming Feng nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>After the five consecutive wins, it would be the sixth battle.</p><p>For the sixth round, a rather famous expert went up directly. This expert had once obtained six consecutive victories in the DI Tian battle arena.</p><p>Those with historical battle records naturally didn’t need to be tested and could directly attack.</p><p>However, this person was still very polite to Lu Ming. He knew that he was not Lu Ming’s match. He came up with the intention of seeking Lu Ming’s guidance.</p><p>“Young master tianyun, please advise me.”</p><p>This person was also very polite.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>There was no suspense as to the result. Lu Ming easily defeated his opponent and gave him some pointers.</p><p>Six consecutive wins, seven consecutive wins, eight consecutive wins …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming successfully achieved ten consecutive victories.</p><p>He won ten consecutive victories with ease, and he didn’t even injure a single person.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve won ten battles in a row. If you want to continue, you’ll have to challenge a seventh grade great Martial Master. Do you still want to continue?”</p><p>The judge looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded without hesitation.</p><p>The entire audience was filled with anticipation.</p><p>How many achievements could Lu Ming achieve by challenging someone one level higher? How many consecutive wins could he achieve?</p><p>It was impossible for the Ditian battle arena to allow an ordinary seventh grade great Martial Master to challenge someone one grade higher. Those who went up were definitely experts of the seventh grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The judge nodded and looked around. is there any seventh grade great Martial Master challenging tianyun? ”</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, a young man in his 30s stood up and went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Yang tai, you can attack me directly.”</p><p>When the judge saw this young man, he did not let him test his strength. Clearly, this person was rather famous in the Ditian battle arena and had obtained the judge’s approval.</p><p>“Tianyun, go ahead. I’m not someone that those sixth grade great master realm martial artists from before can compare to,”</p><p>Yang tai looked at Lu Ming with confidence.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yang tai unleashed his full power. The spear in his hand emitted a dazzling light and pierced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled. The body of the spear trembled and the air emitted a terrifying fluctuation. A terrifying shock wave rushed toward yang tai.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yang tai was hit by the shock wave, and his body was sent flying like a cannonball, falling heavily off the fighting ring.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>One move, just one move, without even using any martial skills, yang tai was sent flying out of the fighting ring with just a shake of the spear.</p><p>Strength, powerful strength.</p><p>In the first ten rounds, Lu Ming was very polite. He defeated his opponent after a few dozen moves and did not display any powerful combat strength.</p><p>Some people had almost forgotten about Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>Now, he finally remembered that Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Yang tai struggled to get up. He looked at Lu Ming in horror and staggered out of the room.</p><p>Then, the challenge continued.</p><p>Winning streak, an unstoppable winning streak.</p><p>In less than an hour, Lu Ming had already achieved seven consecutive victories.</p><p>The entire place was abuzz with excitement.</p><p>“Crossing one level, he’s already won seven times in a row. Do you guys think that tianyun will be able to cross one level and win ten times in a row?”</p><p>it’s hard to say. At this point, Di Tian battle arena probably won’t be able to sit still and will send out a true expert. Up until now, Di Tian battle arena still hasn’t sent out a death warrior? ”</p><p>“That’s right. In my opinion, Di Tian battle arena will send out death fighters for the next round.”</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
