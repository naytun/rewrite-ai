He was screaming in a terrible way, and the fat on his body was shaking.</p><p>There was a pool of blood at his crotch, and his thing was gone.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pants tightened involuntarily. He had seen it clearly just now. With a snap of Xie nianqing’s fingers, a Black Lotus petal flew out and cut off the chunky young man’s thing.</p><p>When the other young men saw this, they also felt a chill down their spines.</p><p>ah, sixth senior brother, avenge me!</p><p>The chunky young man continued to scream.</p><p>b * tch, you’re looking for death. Attack and kill them!</p><p>The sixth senior brother roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to get rid of Lu Ming first, then torture Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath. He immediately used his strongest move.</p><p>A huge palm print suddenly formed above the sixth brother’s head and slammed down. The power was so strong that it was shocking.</p><p>The sixth senior brother was shocked. He had never expected Lu Ming’s attack to be so terrifying. He immediately burst out with all his strength to resist this move.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a loud bang, sixth brother was directly blown into the soil, and a big pit was blown out on the ground.</p><p>When the smoke and dust disappeared, sixth brother was lying in the pit like a pool of mud, dying.</p><p>The other six young men were stunned. Then, they trembled and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>One move, one move to deal with the sixth senior brother, who was a martial Grandmaster. Was this still a martial artist in the Grandmaster realm?</p><p>The chunky youth even forgot to scream as he widened his eyes in fear.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted, and the other six turned around and ran.</p><p>“Wait for me!”</p><p>The short and fat youth screamed, but his crotch was in so much pain that he couldn’t run fast. He was so anxious that tears were about to flow out.</p><p>“You want to run? Do you think you can run?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was as cold as the winter snow. She waved her hands and black Lotus petals flew out.</p><p>The short and fat young man was the first to be killed. He didn’t even have the chance to scream.</p><p>Whoosh! Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>The petals tore through the air, sharper than the sharpest blade.</p><p>Screams were heard again and again. In a few breaths, all six young men were killed.</p><p>At this time, the sixth brother was no longer breathing.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared in the sky and extracted the blood from the corpses, forming blood refining crystals.</p><p>However, not everyone could condense a blood refining crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that only martial artists with fifth level blood vessels could condense a blood refining crystal.</p><p>Those with blood vessels below level five would have their blood Qi dispersed before they could even form a blood refining crystal.</p><p>One of the young men had a sixth level Blood Meridian and had actually condensed two blood refining crystals.</p><p>As for the sixth senior brother, he was a martial arts Grandmaster and had awakened his second bloodline. His second bloodline was an Ordinary Level 9 bloodline, and he had condensed 16 blood refining crystals at once.</p><p>The number of blood refining crystals condensed would double with each level of bloodline, and it had nothing to do with cultivation.</p><p>There were eight of them, so they managed to form a total of 22 blood refining crystals. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing split the crystals equally, so they each got 11. Then, the two of them left the place.</p><p>Along the way, the two of them were ambushed a few more times. However, the strongest of the enemies was only in the first stage of the martial ancestor realm. They were all killed by the two of them and each of them obtained a dozen blood refining crystals.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had four thousand blood refinement pills, the more the better. Secondly, the more blood he accumulated, the higher the possibility of awakening a higher level Blood Meridian.</p><p>According to the nine suns Supreme Master, his first bloodline was awakened because of the nine Dragons ‘blood essence. However, his second bloodline had nothing to do with the nine Dragons’ blood essence. It was his own bloodline that had awakened.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was not too advanced. Lu Yao had deprived him of his Blood Meridian and awakened a fifth-level Blood Meridian. From this, it could be seen that Lu Ming’s first blood Meridian was not higher than the fifth-level.</p><p>Therefore, his second bloodline might not be too powerful, so he would need a large number of blood refinement pills and blood refinement crystals.</p><p>The second bloodline was very special. Some people might not have even used a blood refining pill or other treasures to supplement their bloodline potential, but they could still awaken an extremely high-level bloodline. However, it was not absolute. The chances of awakening a high-level bloodline were much higher after taking blood refining pills or blood refining crystals.</p><p>Half an hour later, the two of them appeared in front of a huge building that was seven stories high.</p><p>This building was shaped like a tower.</p><p>In front of the tower stood more than a hundred young men. They were facing each other and staring at the tower.</p><p>The tower’s door was tightly shut.</p><p>I’ve tried it just now. This door is extremely heavy and can’t be opened by one or several people. I suggest that we work together to open the door. As for the treasures inside, let’s let strength speak for itself.</p><p>A young man in a brocade robe called out.</p><p>“Who knows if you’ll attack us when we open the door? I’m not at ease!”</p><p>A skinny monkey-like young man shouted.</p><p>“If you’re still worried, you can get lost.”</p><p>The youth in the brocade robe was very domineering.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like young man’s face turned ugly, but he didn’t dare to refute.</p><p>he wants the treasure but doesn’t have the guts. He’s destined to be a good-for-nothing with no future in his life.</p><p>The youth in the brocade robe mocked. He then glanced at the others and said, ” “How is it? Do you want to work together to open the tower’s Gate?”</p><p>“Alright, I agree to help you!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>…</p><p>Almost everyone agreed.</p><p>If he wanted to obtain the treasures inside, he had to open the door first.</p><p>“Attack together!”</p><p>The young man in the brocade robe shouted and threw out a powerful punch.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The others also made their moves. Suddenly, all kinds of sword Qi, blade light, fist force, palm wind, and so on were blasted toward the tower’s door.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The building rumbled, and light flickered. Finally, with a loud bang, the door was blasted open.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Wuwu</p><p>Immediately, dozens of people rushed towards the gate, afraid that the treasure would be taken away if they were a step slower.</p><p>“Ah!” Ah!</p><p>However, the next moment, a series of shrill screams rang out. There were dozens of people who had rushed into the gate, and at least twenty of them let out blood-curdling screams as their heads suddenly exploded.</p><p>As for the other dozen or so people, they were all martial ancestor realm powerhouses. They were attacking their surroundings wildly, as if they were fighting something.</p><p>Runes appeared in the sky, and the young men who were killed were all refined into blood refining crystals.</p><p>“What’s there?”</p><p>Someone shouted in fear outside the door.</p><p>“I don’t know. I can’t see clearly.”</p><p>“It’s too strange. I’d better not go in.”</p><p>Some people wanted to retreat.</p><p>At that moment, the martial arts Grandmaster powerhouses had already rushed in and disappeared.</p><p>a type of blood-colored worm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at the door.</p><p>With his eyesight, he could still see the object of attack.</p><p>It was a blood-red Bug that was as thin as a hair and as large as a cicada. Its speed was so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Only a martial Grandmaster would be able to discover it.</p><p>This kind of blood cicada would cause one’s head to explode as soon as it entered.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>The other martial arts grandmasters rushed in one after another. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing moved and followed the crowd.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he rushed in, a blood cicada shot at him. He swept out his spear and sent the blood cicada flying. Then, he rushed in.</p><p>Xie nianqing was the same. He followed Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
