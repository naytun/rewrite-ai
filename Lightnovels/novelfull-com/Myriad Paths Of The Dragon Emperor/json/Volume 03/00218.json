You actually look down on us!”</p><p>Everyone in the general Star Hall gritted their teeth and clenched their fists.</p><p>“What are you looking at? If you want to fight, then come!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s gaze shifted and he looked at the people from the general Star Hall provocatively.</p><p>Contempt, blatant contempt.</p><p>The eyes of the people from the general stars Hall were spitting fire, but no one stepped forward.</p><p>After all, the reputation of the ten direction sword sect was not just for show.</p><p>“Hmph, what a bunch of trash!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man continued to provoke, full of ridicule.</p><p>“Damn it, I’m going to fight!”</p><p>Ming Cheng couldn’t help but get up.</p><p>brother Ming, wait a minute. The other party is deliberately provoking us and trying to test our strength. Why should we fall for their trap? ”</p><p>Lu Ming patted Ming Cheng and said.</p><p>Ming Cheng sat down.</p><p>Junior Brother, I think you don’t have to say anything. They’re clearly a bunch of weaklings and trash. No matter what you say, no one will dare to make a move.</p><p>A youth from the ten directions sword sect called out.</p><p>“A bunch of trash!”</p><p>The crooked mouth youth clamored.</p><p>you’ve gone too far! Today, I’ll experience the skills of the ten direction sword sect!</p><p>Finally, someone from the general stars Hall couldn’t take it anymore. He shouted angrily and strode out.</p><p>“It’s mo gang. He’s about to make his move.”</p><p>mo gang’s cultivation is at the sixth grade great Martial Master realm, and he’s ranked in the top twenty in the general Star Hall’s outer hall.</p><p>with him taking action, it’s enough to see the strength of the disciples of the ten directions Sword School!</p><p>Mo gang walked out and began to discuss among the star Hall disciples.</p><p>finally, someone with some guts has appeared. How about this, I’ll give you three moves, and I won’t fight back within three moves.</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man looked at mo gang in disdain.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to move, take this!”</p><p>Mo gang roared as a mountain-splitting axe appeared in his hand.</p><p>Mo gang swung his mountain-splitting axe at the crooked-mouthed young man.</p><p>The mountain splitting axe slashed through the void, causing the space to tremble like waves. Even a mountain peak would be split in half if the axe were to land.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The people of the general stars Hall cheered in their hearts.</p><p>With such power, let’s see how the crooked mouth young man will let me have three moves.</p><p>But the next moment, their faces froze.</p><p>The crooked-mouthed young man spun the sword in his hand and drew a circle in the air. An invisible force of attraction was generated, and Mo gang’s battle axe was repelled when it came into contact with the circle.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>At the same time, mo gang was forced to take three steps back.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Everyone in the general stars Hall was shocked.</p><p>“What a powerful defensive martial skill!”</p><p>Ming Cheng said with a serious expression.</p><p>“Black grade high level martial arts technique, second stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He could tell the level and maturity of the other party’s martial arts technique.</p><p>two more moves. I said before, I won’t fight back within three moves.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man sneered, his voice filled with contempt.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!” Mo gang bellowed furiously as he swung his axe again.</p><p>This axe was even more powerful, but it was useless. It was still deflected by the crooked-mouth youth’s sword.</p><p>how could this be? is this crooked-mouthed young man the top genius of the ten directions Sword School? ”</p><p>The people from the general Star Hall called out in disbelief.</p><p>They suspected that the ten direction sword sect had deliberately sent geniuses to attack them.</p><p>you’re thinking too much. Let me tell you, I’m nothing in the ten direction Sword School. There are countless people stronger than me.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man said indifferently.</p><p>impossible! Take my third move!</p><p>die! mo gang roared as his blood vessels erupted. The muscles on his majestic body bulged as he swung his axe toward the crooked-mouthed young man.</p><p>Mo gang had used all his strength in this strike, his strongest move.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Mo gang’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>“Break? Can you break it?”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man sneered. He rotated his sword, and his body was covered with circles of sword light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew as mo gang’s battle axe collided with the sword, and his body staggered backward once more.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Mo gang roared. He found it difficult to accept.</p><p>“You piece of trash, die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword light flashed like lightning.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Someone from the general Star Hall shouted. However, mo gang’s mind had been distracted earlier, and it was already too late for him to react.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The sword light pierced through mo gang’s throat. Mo gang roared before falling to the ground.</p><p>Mo gang had been killed. The general Star Hall’s people fell silent, their faces grave.</p><p>“And you said you’re not trash. Now, the truth is right in front of you. If you’re not convinced, you can come up and fight me!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s eyes swept around Bini.</p><p>The people of the general stars Hall were extremely humiliated.</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions sword sect looked at the people from the general Star Hall with disdain.</p><p>“What a bunch of trash!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s gaze swept around and finally landed on the ten observation pillars.</p><p>“You, get down here!”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man suddenly pointed at the white-red image on the tenth viewing pillar.</p><p>Bai Chi’s face suddenly stiffened. He squeezed out an ugly smile and cupped his fists, ” “Senior brother, what are your instructions?”</p><p>His attitude was humble, hoping to win the other party’s favor.</p><p>This caused the others to feel a burst of displeasure.</p><p>Unfortunately, the crooked mouth youth did not buy it and shouted, ” “Who Do You Think You Are? Are you even allowed to call me senior brother? Get down here immediately, I’m taking your clairvoyant pillar.”</p><p>“What? You want the boundary-observing pillar?”</p><p>Baichi was shocked and his face turned ugly.</p><p>don’t go too far. Since ancient times, the imperial family and the ten direction Sword School have distributed the gazing at the horizon pillars. This represents the glory of the imperial family. I can’t give it to you.</p><p>On another observation pillar, a young man in a yellow robe roared.</p><p>This young man was a member of the imperial family.</p><p>what kind of bullshit glory is this? today, you have to give it to me even if you don’t want to. If you don’t, I’ll beat you up until you give it to me.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man sneered.</p><p>Baichi almost cried out. He was in a dilemma.</p><p>If he didn’t give it to them, it was obvious that he would have to face the disciples of the ten direction Sword School. However, if he gave it to them, he would be destroying the honor of the royal family. Everyone in the general Star Hall would cast him aside, and he would never be able to raise his head in the general Star Hall in the future.</p><p>At this moment, he was so regretful that his intestines turned green. If he had known this earlier, he definitely wouldn’t have been so thick-skinned as to snatch this observing pillar.</p><p>“Baichi, if you give it up, you will be a sinner of the general stars Hall. There is no one in the general stars Hall who is afraid of death. At worst, we will fight. If we can’t win, we will just die. I will support you in spirit.”</p><p>Ming Cheng yelled unkindly, pushing bai chi into the fire pit.</p><p>Ming Cheng grinned and almost laughed out loud.</p><p>“I also support you in spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed suit and shouted.</p><p>support your sister! Who needs spiritual support? ”</p><p>Bai chi roared in his heart. Lu Ming and Ming Cheng were clearly gloating.</p><p>“Senior brother, please enlighten me!”</p><p>Left with no choice, bai chi could only brace himself and cupped his fists at the crooked-mouthed young man.</p><p>“It seems like you’re going to have a fight. Let me see what you’re capable of. I know you’re one of the top ten experts of the general Star Hall.”</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man sneered. Suddenly, his body moved and he pounced toward bai chi.</p><p>“Dragon White Snake palm, Dragon Transformation!”</p><p>Baichi roared and struck out with his palm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
