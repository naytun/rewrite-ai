In the blazing sun Empire, they were definitely considered a first-class expert. They belonged to the upper echelons. Compared to them, a martial Grandmaster was far inferior, so their status was naturally extraordinary.</p><p>However, 100,000 spiritual crystals was not a small amount. Even a martial arts Grandmaster would have to think twice.</p><p>“Eccentric red, what’s wrong? You don’t dare to bet? If you don’t dare to bet, just say it, don’t be stubborn!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi mocked.</p><p>“Who said I don’t dare to bet? There are so many witnesses here, I hope you won’t go back on your word.”</p><p>The red-haired old man said.</p><p>hahaha, you’re the one I’m afraid of going back on your word. Eccentric red, your Cloud Net fruit is mine!</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi laughed heartily.</p><p>He was one hundred percent confident that he could win, because yang Zaitian was in the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>He was very clear about yang Zaitian’s strength. Yang Zaitian had said that he wanted to kill tianyun, so as long as tianyun touched yang Zaitian, he would be dead.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Half a beat later</p><p>“Someone’s coming out!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>As expected, the door of light flickered, and figures appeared one after another.</p><p>Soon, dozens of young men came out. They were all disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>The elders of the ten direction sword sect, including Qiu Wuzhi, had calm expressions on their faces. All of this was within their expectations.</p><p>However, they didn’t notice that the disciples of the ten directions Sword School all had gloomy expressions.</p><p>They continued to pay attention to the door of light.</p><p>After that, the light door flickered non-stop, and people walked out of it.</p><p>Soon, two hundred people came out. They were all disciples of the Shi Fang Sword School. None of them were students of the general Star Hall.</p><p>The faces of the red-haired elder, Hua Chi, and the other elders of the imperial family turned uglier and uglier.</p><p>“How is that possible? Why hasn’t anyone come out yet!”</p><p>Hua Chi clenched his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>hahaha, eccentric red, I think your General Star Hall has most likely been completely annihilated. You’re going to lose for sure. Hurry up and hand over the cloud Net fruit!</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi laughed heartily.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The red-haired old man’s expression was ugly. He gritted his teeth and said, ” “Qiu Wuzhi, don’t be too happy yet. The time is not up yet. No one knows the result until the last moment!”</p><p>haha, eccentric red, you’re really good at deceiving yourself. Alright, let’s wait and see.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi sneered.</p><p>“Elder Qiu, let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, a disciple from the ten direction sword sect wanted to say something. However, he was interrupted by Qiu Wuzhi.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi waved his hand and said, ” “Alright, you’ve all done well this time. It’s been hard on you, but not everyone is here yet. We’ll talk about counting the blood ant eggs later!”</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>The young man wanted to continue, but Qiu Wuzhi’s face darkened and he glared at him. He swallowed his words.</p><p>At this moment, the door of light shone again, and more than twenty young men appeared.</p><p>These twenty-odd people were all from the general Star Hall.</p><p>The red-haired elder and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Hmph, I’m just lucky. I don’t know where I hid, but I was lucky enough to survive. However, I don’t know how many blood ant eggs I obtained. I don’t think I can’t even make one blood refinement pill!</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi laughed coldly.</p><p>The red-haired elder and the others were silent. They didn’t have much hope in their hearts.</p><p>As time passed, a few more people came out. They were all disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>In the end, the ten direction sword sect sent out about two hundred and eighty people.</p><p>This made Qiu Wuzhi and the others from the ten direction Sword School turn pale.</p><p>The time was almost up, and the door of light was about to close.</p><p>Once the door of light closed, they would not be able to open it. They could only wait for three years before they could open it.</p><p>But at this time, there were still many people from the ten direction sword sect who had not come out.</p><p>More importantly, out of the six geniuses who had comprehended force, two had yet to come out.</p><p>One of them was yang Zaitian.</p><p>“He’s probably delayed while exploring the blood ant nest!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi consoled himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were wide open as he stared at the light door.</p><p>Lu Ming had not come out yet. He was really afraid that there would be an accident.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and it was getting closer and closer to the time when the door of light would close.</p><p>However, no one came out.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi started to get anxious.</p><p>The others were fine, but yang Zaitian hadn’t come out yet. How could it be possible?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the light door flashed slightly, and two figures appeared.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi, the red-haired elder, and the other elders of both sides stared at the scene.</p><p>The outline of the two figures slowly became clear.</p><p>“Tianyun? How is that possible?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi howled in disbelief.</p><p>“Tianyun, it’s tianyun!”</p><p>The red-haired old man’s eyes widened. Then, he became ecstatic and laughed out loud.</p><p>The two people who came out later were naturally Lu Ming and Ming Cheng.</p><p>“Damn it, this tianyun must have found a place to hide. I didn’t see yang Zaitian or the other disciples. Damn it!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi growled in his heart.</p><p>haha, Qiu Wuzhi, tianyun is still alive. You’ve lost. Hand over the Mithril, and don’t go back on your word!</p><p>The red-haired old man said.</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>QiuQiu Wuzhi’s face turned ugly. He really couldn’t bear to do it, but he couldn’t go back on his word in front of so many people.</p><p>“It’s all this tianyun’s fault, why didn’t he just go and die!”</p><p>He roared in his heart and blamed everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he still had no choice. He gritted his teeth and took out a fist-sized piece of silver metal that was shimmering with Starlight and handed it to the red-haired old man.</p><p>This was the star Mithril. The other martial arts grandmasters looked at the red-haired elder with envy.</p><p>“Haha, then I won’t stand on ceremony!”</p><p>The red-haired old man laughed as he put it away.</p><p>He then looked at Lu Ming. The more he looked at Lu Ming, the more he found him pleasing to the eye.</p><p>“Why hasn’t yang Zaitian come out yet?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi stared at the light door with a dark expression.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the light door trembled violently and exploded with a bang. It turned into a rain of light and disappeared.</p><p>“How could this be? What about yang Zaitian? Why didn’t he come out?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi roared.</p><p>“What happened? Why didn’t yang Zaitian come out? there are so many other disciples. What happened?”</p><p>The other elders of the ten directions Sword School also roared in anger.</p><p>“Senior brother yang Zaitian is dead!”</p><p>Suddenly, a disciple from the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>The entire place fell silent. Qiu Wuzhi stared at this disciple with an ugly expression and shouted, ” “What did you just say? Yang Zaitian was dead? How did he die? Who in the blood ant secret realm could kill him? Even when facing the mother ant, he was able to escape unscathed. How could he have died?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi bellowed as a powerful aura burst forth from his body.</p><p>“He’s really dead. Most of the disciples here saw it.”</p><p>The disciple shouted.</p><p>“Yes, elder, yang Zaitian is really dead!”</p><p>The other disciples nodded in agreement.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s face turned ashen and his eyes revealed a terrifying light. He stared at the disciple and shouted, ” “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p><p>“Elder Qiu, I wanted to say it just now, but you didn’t let me.”</p><p>The disciple said in an aggrieved manner.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
