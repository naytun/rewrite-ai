The tables were placed together and took up more than half of the Hall’s area.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded slightly and took out a storage ring. Everyone fixed their eyes on it.</p><p>The storage ring glowed, and a small mountain appeared on the table. It was a small mountain formed by the blood ant eggs.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“There are so many Gu? How many can there be?”</p><p>One of the students from the general Star Hall stammered and almost bit his tongue.</p><p>“Heavens, isn’t this too much? Could it be that tianyun has emptied out the entire blood ant nest?”</p><p>Another young man shouted.</p><p>“Start counting!”</p><p>The imperial family’s elder reacted and began to count excitedly.</p><p>Not long after, the numbers were out.</p><p>“Twenty-three thousand one hundred and fifty-three!”</p><p>An elder of the imperial family reported the number with a trembling voice.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped.</p><p>Even though he had expected this, he was still shocked by the number.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in bewilderment.</p><p>How many blood refinement pills could he exchange for so many blood ant eggs?</p><p>23153 blood ant eggs, which can be exchanged for 3858 blood ant eggs. I also have five more blood ant eggs to support with spiritual crystals.</p><p>The imperial family elder announced, but before he could finish, Hua Chi interrupted him.</p><p>“Wait a minute. Tianyun has obtained such a large number of blood ant eggs, so there’s no need to count them so seriously. I’ll make the decision. Tianyun’s blood ant eggs can be exchanged for 4000 blood refinement pills. Make it a whole number!”</p><p>Hua Chi announced.</p><p>“Yes, eighth prince!”</p><p>The elder noted it down.</p><p>“Many thanks, eighth prince!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming would not reject the offer of more than a hundred blood refinement pills.</p><p>Immediately after, the imperial family elder put away all the blood ant eggs.</p><p>Of course, there were no blood refinement pills at the moment. He had to wait for the blood ant eggs to be refined into blood refinement pills before he could give them to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid that the royal family would swallow his blood ant eggs. Putting aside his relationship with Hua Chi, even if they did not have this relationship, the royal family would not do so.</p><p>The current situation of the imperial family required the assistance of talents. If the imperial family were to swallow even these blood ant eggs, then they would be short-sighted and digging their own grave.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was very assured.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, you’ve completely offended the omnipresent Sword School and caused them to lose face. They won’t let you off. After some time, there will definitely be stronger geniuses from the omnipresent Sword School coming to look for you. You must be careful.”</p><p>Before they left, Hua Chi reminded Lu Ming in a low voice.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Do you think I’m afraid?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Hua Chi was stunned for a moment before he smiled. Ever since he knew Lu Ming, he had never seen Lu Ming afraid of anyone.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be waiting for the good news of you killing everyone!”</p><p>Hua Chi laughed before leaving.</p><p>After Hua Chi and the rest left, Lu Ming left the place and returned to the dormitory.</p><p>I’ll go to the earth Yuan cave first to consolidate my cultivation. Then, I’ll buy resources and break through to the next realm!</p><p>After returning, Lu Ming pondered for a moment and walked towards the earth cave.</p><p>This time, he flashed his Hua Chi token, and the expert guarding the door gave him a pile of inscription stones, allowing him to cultivate for as long as he wanted.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly delighted. He took the inscription stone and entered the earth cave.</p><p>He didn’t stop and continued down.</p><p>On the third and fourth levels, there were still people sitting cross-legged, trying to snatch other people’s Secret cultivation rooms.</p><p>When Lu Ming passed by and they saw him, their expressions changed.</p><p>Although it had only been a day since Lu Ming was in the blood ant Mystic realm, the news had already spread throughout the general Star Hall. Many people knew of tianyun’s name.</p><p>Lu Ming’s methods shocked everyone.</p><p>Lu Ming had another nickname, ruthless.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with deep respect.</p><p>Lu Ming only glanced at them casually and continued to head down.</p><p>When he reached the fifth level, Lu Ming did not stop. He continued down to the sixth level.</p><p>The fire-based spiritual Qi on the sixth floor was several times denser than the fifth floor.</p><p>Lu Ming opened a secret room, walked in, and started to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming had devoured the blood ant’s blood essence and his cultivation level had skyrocketed. His Foundation was a little unstable, so he could use the fire-element spiritual energy to stabilize his Foundation.</p><p>Ten days later, Lu Ming’s Foundation was extremely stable and impregnable. There were no flaws at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming walked out of the earth cave.</p><p>Anyway, he could come and cultivate at any time. Lu Ming did not care how long he would cultivate.</p><p>After walking out of the earth cave, Lu Ming left the general Star Hall and headed towards the largest market in the imperial capital.</p><p>The Imperial City’s city square was incomparably huge and occupied an incomparably vast area.</p><p>Here, shops formed a forest and Chambers of Commerce gathered.</p><p>There were even many Chambers of Commerce that were not native to the burning sun Empire. Instead, they came from other empires and brought with them some of the specialties of other empires.</p><p>There were thirty-six empires near the Cloud King Mountain range. The burning sun Empire was only a low-tier Empire.</p><p>Therefore, the Imperial City’s market was filled with people at all times.</p><p>Lu Ming walked on the streets of the market, his eyes dazzled and he looked around.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to a five-story building that occupied a large area.</p><p>Treasure Pavilion, three gold-encrusted words, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and walked in.</p><p>“Young master, is there anything you need?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked into the treasure Pavilion, a sweet-looking young girl came up to him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s bearing was extraordinary. Although he was dressed ordinarily, he exuded an extraordinary aura just by standing there casually. No one dared to ignore it.</p><p>The young girl was naturally very attentive.</p><p>“I’m here to buy some demonic beast blood essence!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Buy demonic beast blood essence?”</p><p>The sweet young lady was delighted.</p><p>Demonic beast blood essence was usually used to refine weapons or pills. It was extremely valuable and those who could buy it were usually big customers.</p><p>“Young master, may I ask what level of demonic beast’s blood essence you want to buy?”</p><p>The young girl asked, suppressing the excitement in her heart.</p><p>blood essence of a class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If he wanted to buy something, he would buy the blood essence of Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beasts. Anything below Class 9 Lv 3 would not be of much help to him.</p><p>“Ninth grade third level?”</p><p>The young girl suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>It immediately attracted the attention of others, and the people around them all looked over.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. This young girl’s reaction was too big.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t have any?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The young girl covered her mouth and looked around. When she heard Lu Ming’s words, she hurriedly nodded and said, ” yes, yes, young master. The blood essence of a class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast is extremely precious. Please follow me to the guest room. I’ll ask the manager to come.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was fine as long as there were.</p><p>He followed the young lady to a guest room at the back. Naturally, someone had prepared some high-quality tea.</p><p>After a while, a chubby shopkeeper came in with a face full of smiles. As soon as he came in, he cupped his fists and said with a smile, ” young master, I heard that you want to buy the blood essence of a class 9 Level 3 demonic beast? ”</p><p>“Not bad!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
