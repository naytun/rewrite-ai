He clenched his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with ferocity.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, and a wild, beast-like aura exploded from his body. It was extremely terrifying and vast.</p><p>He was in the late third level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“You’re tianyun? Just now, you only used your movement technique to avoid Gao Li’s attack and caught him off guard. What’s so great about it? in my opinion, it’s just a despicable method. Otherwise, how could you seriously injure Gao Li with your second grade martial ancestor realm cultivation?”</p><p>Huaying stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered to explain.</p><p>however, this will not work in my hands. I will let you know what true strength is.</p><p>Huaying’s eyes were filled with confidence.</p><p>His talent was indeed very high. At the age of 25, he had already cultivated to the late stage of martial ancestor 3-dan. Even in the blood Zhao Empire, where geniuses were as common as clouds, he was still a top genius, only slightly weaker than the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao.</p><p>In the younger generation of the blazing sun Empire, other than the six heroes of the blazing sun Empire, he did not believe that there was anyone else who could be a match for him.</p><p>Therefore, he did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>three moves. I will defeat you within three moves. If I can’t defeat you, why don’t I give you the position of commander? ”</p><p>Huaying put her hands behind her back and looked extremely arrogant.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. Then, he slowly stretched out a finger.</p><p>“One move? Haha, it seems like you don’t have much confidence in yourself. Do you think I can defeat you in one move?”</p><p>Huaying laughed.</p><p>“No, you’ve misunderstood.”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and said,”what I mean is, I will defeat you in one move.” &Nbsp;</p><p>“What? What did you just say? You defeated me in one move? Hahaha!”</p><p>Huaying was stunned for a moment, thinking that she had misheard him. Then, she burst out laughing.</p><p>“Defeat me in one move? Even if the six heroes of the scorching sun are here, they wouldn’t dare to say such words. You’re so boastful. I’d like to see how you’re going to defeat me in one move.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out of Huaying’s body, and a beam of sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>At the same time, his bloodline also burst out, and a silver chakra appeared, which was extremely dazzling.</p><p>Hua Ying’s second bloodline was also a first tier King bloodline. This meant that he had the potential of one of the six scorching sun heroes.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Hua Ying held his sword with both hands and raised it high. A giant sword that was a hundred meters long formed and stood between the sky and the earth.</p><p>The twenty thousand soldiers were all shocked.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight. What’s the use of all these tricks?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and then struck out a palm.</p><p>A huge beast claw condensed in the sky and pressed down on Huaying’s giant sword.</p><p>This beast claw was more than twenty meters long and wide. It was like a small mountain, covered in black scales, looking extremely ferocious.</p><p>The second palm of the three Palms, beast palm!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Under the beast DAO palm, the giant sword that Huaying had condensed was like a bubble, collapsing.</p><p>The beast’s claw did not stop and continued to press down on Huaying.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Huaying let out a roar of disbelief. He kept swinging his sword upwards, sending out sword Qi at the beast claw.</p><p>However, it was of no use. The sword Qi collapsed one after another, and the Beast claw continued to press down on Huaying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A cloud of dust filled the air as Huaying was directly crushed by the beast’s claw and smashed into the ground.</p><p>After a while, the beast claw disappeared, leaving a twenty-meter wide beast paw print on the ground. Hua Ying was lying in the palm print, twitching and foaming at the mouth.</p><p>Tragic, it was really too tragic.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, one slap would have been enough to smash him into a pulp of flesh.</p><p>“Good! The invincible tianyun!”</p><p>After a long moment of silence, a loud shout suddenly came from the Army.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze over and saw Ming Feng in the Army.</p><p>The roar just now was from Ming Feng.</p><p>If it wasn’t Ming Zhu and Ming Cheng beside Ming Feng, who else could it be?</p><p>the invincible tianyun!</p><p>Ming Feng continued to shout. After that, Ming Zhu and Ming Cheng also shouted.</p><p>Soon, the others seemed to have been infected as well and started to shout as well.</p><p>The 20,000-strong Army let out a deafening howl that shook the heavens.</p><p>In the end, even the geniuses of star cluster Hall started to roar.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand and the entire place suddenly fell silent.</p><p>“Everyone, it is thanks to his Majesty’s favor that I am allowed to become the commander of this Army. I, tianyun, swear that as long as everyone believes in me, I will do my best to lead everyone to great achievements!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s clear voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>“Make a contribution, make a contribution!”</p><p>The 20,000 strong Army roared.</p><p>On the high platform, Hua Zhengxing stroked his beard and looked at Lu Ming with admiration in his eyes.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>At this moment, Hua Ying and Gao Li had already struggled to get up, but their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Alright, Gao Li, Hua Ying, step forward and listen to my orders!”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing suddenly shouted.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>Huaying and Gawain bowed.</p><p>“Now, tianyun is the Commander-in-Chief. Are you convinced?”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing asked.</p><p>“I … I’m convinced!”</p><p>The two of them hesitated for a moment before answering.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that although the two of them were convincing verbally, they might not be convinced in their hearts.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care. He did not take these two people to heart at all.</p><p>alright, since that’s the case, we’ll set off immediately!</p><p>Hua Zhengxing announced.</p><p>Not long after, an Army of 20000 soldiers, each riding a tall green scale horse, left the capital and headed north.</p><p>The 20,000-strong Army formed a long Dragon that stomped across the earth.</p><p>Lu Ming was riding on a tall and majestic green scaled horse at the front. Xie nianqing, the Golden-eyed blood corpse, and the three siblings from Ming city were following him.</p><p>Behind them were Huaying and the other young geniuses.</p><p>“Ming Cheng, why are you guys here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously on the way.</p><p>“Because the general of Moonview city is our Father.”</p><p>Ming Feng rushed to say.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>The place they were going to provide assistance to this time was Full Moon City.</p><p>Although the royal family was weak, the northern border with the Dark Moon Empire was an important military location. The royal family still had two powerful legions guarding it and listening to the royal family’s orders.</p><p>One of them was the mountain Army, and the other was the northern Army.</p><p>The two legions were both elite and had been through hundreds of battles. Each of them had 100000 troops and could be considered one of the few elite legions of the royal family.</p><p>Ming Cheng and Ming Zhu’s father was the general of the mountain suppressing Army, Ming Meng.</p><p>This time, the one million troops of the Dark Moon Empire were attacking. The first to bear the brunt was, of course, the ghost moon saber sect.</p><p>The mountain Army and the northern Army were also affected and started a fierce battle with the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>The mountain-suppressing Army was struggling and had asked for help from the royal family. This time, Lu Ming and the rest were rushing to the mountain-suppressing Army’s aid. Therefore, the three Ming siblings naturally followed.</p><p>Along the way, the three Ming siblings were very worried that something bad would happen to their father.</p><p>The Army’s speed was naturally much slower than Lu Ming’s flying.</p><p>It would take at least a month’s time to travel from the imperial capital to Full Moon City.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
