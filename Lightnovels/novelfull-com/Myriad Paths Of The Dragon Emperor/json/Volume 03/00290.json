She told you not to keep thinking about surpassing her, because that’s a waste of time, and it’s impossible!”</p><p>Lu Ming relayed Xie nianjun’s words to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“As expected, you’re still so self-righteous!”</p><p>After hearing this, Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and said with determination, ” “Isn’t it just an innate King level bloodline? What’s so great about her? one day, I’m going to step on her. ”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. This chick really liked to trample on others.</p><p>At the same time, he was secretly shocked. From what Xie nianqing said, Xie nianjun actually had a natural King-level bloodline. That was terrifying.</p><p>The meaning of innate king class bloodline was that the first bloodline awakened was a king class bloodline.</p><p>Without a doubt, this kind of person was a rare monster with a terrifying talent.</p><p>No wonder Xie nianjun was so powerful. With his sixth grade Grandmaster realm cultivation, he was able to injure a martial Grandmaster from the shadow Wolf Pavilion with just an inscription formation.</p><p>Lu Ming even suspected that Xie nianjun had not used his full strength at that time.</p><p>“What kind of sisters are they? what’s their background? His talent was actually so amazing? They don’t seem to get along?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly curious.</p><p>However, since Xie nianqing didn’t say anything, he didn’t ask.</p><p>On the back of the blood demon, there was silence as they continued on their way to the burning sun Empire.</p><p>……</p><p>Blazing sun Empire, outside the blood Realm and Devil’s Den.</p><p>Four figures were standing guard there. These four people were the ones who Qiu changkong had asked him to guard this place.</p><p>“How f * cking unlucky. It’s all because of those two little bastards. They made me stay in this godforsaken place. It’s been more than ten days. I think those two little bastards must have died in there.”</p><p>A burly man cursed unhappily.</p><p>“Although we’ll definitely die if we enter the blood domain and Devil’s Den, young master changkong is just being cautious. Let’s guard here for another month. If there’s still no movement after a month, we’ll leave.”</p><p>A white-haired old man said.</p><p>He had the highest cultivation among the four of them, reaching the fourth level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Hmph, I really hope those two little bastards didn’t die. If that’s the case, I’ll make them regret being born into this world!”</p><p>The burly large man sinisterly said.</p><p>However, the next moment, his pupils suddenly widened, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>The other three were in a similar situation.</p><p>In the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave, a bloody mist rolled out, and three figures walked out from the bloody mist.</p><p>If it was not Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, who else could it be?</p><p>After more than a day’s journey, the blood demon finally carried them to the border of the burning sun Empire’s blood zone and Devil’s Cave.</p><p>There was no stone door here. Instead, there was a door of light. After stepping through the door of light, one would naturally leave the blood Realm and Devil’s Cave.</p><p>However, the blood demons couldn’t leave with them, but the Golden-eyed blood zombies could. The Golden-eyed blood zombies didn’t belong to the blood zone.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, as soon as he left the blood Realm and Devil’s Den, he ran into the people from the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>“Hahaha, these two little bastards are really not dead? Fine, fine, fine, I’ll take them down and torture them. I’ll make them tell me the secret of why they didn’t die after entering the blood Realm and Devil’s Den!”</p><p>The burly man laughed, his eyes filled with coldness. The aura of a second grade martial arts Grandmaster exploded from his body and pressed down on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“You want to know? Alright, come here, I’ll throw you in and you’ll know.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>you’re on the verge of death and you’re still trying to win with your words. You’re really stupid. Kneel down!</p><p>The burly man strode forward and pressed his palm toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was not bad, he was at the second level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He was confident that he could suppress Lu Ming with a single palm.</p><p>However, the result was completely beyond his expectations. Lu Ming stretched out his hand casually and grabbed his palm.</p><p>At the same time, an extremely strong genuine Qi gushed toward his palm. With a destructive force, it crushed his genuine Qi and gushed into his arm.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking came from his palm. Then, the muscles of his arm exploded, and the bones broke into pieces.</p><p>????!</p><p>The burly man screamed like a pig being slaughtered. He was in so much pain that tears were flowing out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s kick landed on the burly man’s dantian, shattering the cyclone in his dantian and crippling his cultivation.</p><p>The burly man let out a desperate scream.</p><p>“That’s f * cking unpleasant to hear. Didn’t you want to know why I didn’t die after entering the blood Realm and Devil’s Den? You can go in and take a look yourself.”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming swung his arm and threw the burly man into the blood Realm.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>The burly man shouted in despair, but in the blink of an eye, his figure disappeared.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this time, the remaining three people from the ten direction Sword School finally reacted. They all shouted, and their eyes revealed shock and disbelief.</p><p>The burly man’s strength was at the second tier of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, but he was completely helpless against Lu Ming. It had only been a short ten days, how did Lu Ming become so strong?</p><p>you’re the ones who will die today. The ten direction sword sect will start with you. Let’s collect some interest first.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold as he strode toward the remaining three people.</p><p>presumptuous, you little bastard. Don’t think that you can be impudent in front of me just because you killed a second level martial ancestor. I’ll let you know that the difference between a second level and a fourth level martial ancestor is like heaven and earth.</p><p>The white-haired elder howled as his bloodline exploded, raising his strength to the maximum.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He swung his sword, and a vast sword Qi slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying fist radiance burst out from Lu Ming’s fist, tearing through the void and crashing into the vast sword Qi.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword Qi instantly dispersed, but the remaining fist radiance didn’t slow down and landed on the old man.</p><p>The old man let out a blood-curdling screech and spat out a large mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying back a thousand meters.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? This man is invincible. I have to run away and report this to young master changkong.”</p><p>The white-haired old man revealed a look of disbelief and turned to run.</p><p>When the other two saw that Lu Ming had sent the white-haired old man flying with one punch, they were scared out of their wits. They turned around and flew into the distance.</p><p>“You want to leave? How was that possible? Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw two consecutive punches.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two fist radiances streaked across the sky and headed towards the two people.</p><p>The two of them were only in the first tier of the martial ancestor realm and could not resist at all. Two screams rang out and the two of them were directly blown up in the air.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped on the void and chased after the old man.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he had caught up to the old man.</p><p>The old man roared and fought back desperately, but it was useless. He was blown up by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
