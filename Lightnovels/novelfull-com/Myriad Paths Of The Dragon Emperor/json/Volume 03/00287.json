He clapped his hands repeatedly, as if he had mistaken the demonic beast for Lu Ming. He vented all his anger on the demonic beast.</p><p>These demonic beasts were in a miserable state. A few of them were defeated on the spot.</p><p>“This woman is so violent!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and the Spear’s gleam burst out.</p><p>With the two of them working together, the demonic beasts were all killed in a short time.</p><p>The two of them stood facing each other, looking at each other in silence. Only one of them could continue forward.</p><p>little Qing, if we keep going, we’ll probably have to fight yang Liuji. If you can do it, I’ll let you go.</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>no need. I’m no match for yang Liuji. I’ll give you this chance. But let me tell you, if you lose to yang Liuji and lose the treasure at the top, I’ll never let you go!</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming had the Golden-eyed blood corpse by his side. Perhaps she could compete with yang Liuji directly. Xie nianqing knew that she was not yang Liuji’s match, so she might as well give her to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, thank you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at him and turned to walk down.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, more than a thousand people were looking up.</p><p>They had no idea what was happening on the mountain, because after the mountain road went up for a while, it was covered by a layer of hazy light, and they could not see clearly.</p><p>“What do you guys think is up there?”</p><p>there must be some treasures. The stone tablet said it was the way for the disciples of the cloud Emperor Palace to compete. The reward must be extraordinary.</p><p>it’s a pity that we’re too weak. We can’t go up at all.</p><p>I know the other six of those eight people. There’s also a young man and a young woman, but I’ve never seen them before. I wonder who they are, to be able to suppress all the heroes and seize a path.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest disappeared, the crowd below started to discuss.</p><p>After that, they began to wait, wanting to know what kind of treasure was on the mountain path.</p><p>“Look, someone’s coming down!”</p><p>Not long after, someone called out. Everyone looked over and saw the short and fat youth walking down the seventh path.</p><p>“It’s ke Dong. Why did he come down? what happened?”</p><p>Everyone was confused.</p><p>guys, look! The 50 super rookies have also come down.</p><p>At this moment, two people walked down from the second and sixth roads.</p><p>These two were two of the 50 super rookies from the blood Zhao Empire.</p><p>even the 50 supernovelties have come down. What kind of danger is there up there? ”</p><p>“Where are the others? Why didn’t he come down? did he die up there?”</p><p>“Ke Dong, what’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone was guessing and someone asked ke Dong.</p><p>Ke Dong was silent for a moment. He did not hide anything and explained what had happened.</p><p>I see. After a few rounds, the two roads will meet and have a battle. No wonder it’s said to be a competition for the disciples of the cloud Emperor Palace.</p><p>I’m not surprised that yang Liuji won, but according to what ke Dong said, the beautiful woman on the fifth path actually defeated the 50 super rookies. It’s really unbelievable.</p><p>that’s right. According to this speculation, Duan Ling will definitely lose when he meets yang Liuji later. The two strangers will face each other, and the person who wins in the end will face yang Liuji.</p><p>yang Liuji has reached the end without a doubt. I wonder which of the two strangers will win? ”</p><p>“We’ll see. We’ll have a result soon.”</p><p>The crowd discussed as they waited.</p><p>Not long after, someone came down.</p><p>It was Duan Ling. His body was staggering, and his clothes were stained with blood.</p><p>Duan Ling is injured. Could it be that he fought with yang Liuji? ”</p><p>I think so. He’s overestimating himself. He wants to fight with yang Liuji. He’s lucky to have survived.</p><p>that’s right. Even Yin jiuyou, the head of the yin moon’s nine talents, is no match for yang Liuji.</p><p>“Hey, look, that woman is coming down.”</p><p>Someone suddenly called out.</p><p>Everyone looked at the fifth road and saw Xie nianqing coming down.</p><p>this woman is so powerful. She defeated 50 super rookies, and she still lost? ”</p><p>it seems like the other unfamiliar man is stronger? ”</p><p>there are really crouching tigers and hidden dragons here. I wonder if that man can compete with yang Liuji? ”</p><p>that’s impossible. That man’s cultivation is too weak. He’s far from the six extremes of yang!</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>Even so, everyone’s eyes were still wide open as they stared at the mountain path, revealing looks of anticipation.</p><p>Who would be the first one to come down?</p><p>On the mountain path, after Xie nianqing went down, Lu Ming continued to go up. There was a ball of light in front.</p><p>This ball of light was actually a section of withered vine.</p><p>The withered vine was only half a meter long and as thick as a finger.</p><p>“What is this? A withered vine? What’s the use of it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He held the withered vine and looked at it from left to right, but he could not see anything special about it.</p><p>It was like an ordinary withered vine, without the slightest vitality.</p><p>“Forget it, I’d better keep it first!”</p><p>After all, he had obtained it from the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace. He wouldn’t really give it to a withered vine, right? Perhaps it would be useful?</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming continued to move upwards.</p><p>After a while, more demonic beasts appeared.</p><p>This time, four demonic beasts of the early 5th martial ancestor realm appeared.</p><p>The fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm was three levels higher than Lu Ming’s. It gave him immense pressure.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate to activate his Blood Meridian.</p><p>It was not the nine Dragon bloodline that burst out, but his second bloodline.</p><p>An ancient stone tablet appeared. The stone tablet was shrouded in a gray mist, making it look mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p>Then, the stone tablet entered Lu Ming’s body and his strength increased rapidly.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming rarely activated his Blood Meridian. It was not that he did not want to activate it, but the duration of the activation of the nine dragon blood Meridian was too short. It only lasted for a few breaths.</p><p>But now that he had awakened his second bloodline, this problem would no longer exist.</p><p>At the martial arts Grandmaster realm, the duration of the bloodline eruption was increased to an hour, which was enough for him to fight without restraint.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian exploded. He was so powerful that he charged at the four demonic beasts with an imposing aura.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He pulled out his spear and it collided with a demonic beast.</p><p>With a loud boom, a burst of energy shot out, and he and the demonic beast retreated together.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The other three demonic beasts charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged forward with the demon subduing spear in his hand.</p><p>The demon subduing spear was shrouded in the power of wind and Fire. When it was waved, it was extremely fast. At the same time, it exploded with waves of heat. Its lethality was extremely shocking.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued. During this process, Lu Ming did not let the blood corpse attack.</p><p>“Haha, this is great!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He was completely immersed in the battle.</p><p>His fusion with the Wind and Fire forces had also deepened.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
