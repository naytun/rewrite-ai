The gold disciple of the ten directions Sword School couldn’t resist at all and was easily suppressed.</p><p>Previously, those who thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure felt their faces burning.</p><p>Lu Ming was not scared out of his wits. He was not courting death. He had the confidence and the ability.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The long spear condensed from essential Qi in Lu Ming’s hands turned into a flash of lightning and shot out like an arrow.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the chest of the youth from the ten directions Sword School, killing him.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The remaining young man was scared out of his wits as he frantically fled into the distance.</p><p>“Who told you that you can walk? Let’s go and accompany your companions!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. The long spear pierced through the void and pierced towards the other party.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The other party roared and used all his strength to slash out with his sword.</p><p>A mighty sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming’s long spear. However, with a splat, the sword Qi was pierced through by the long spear.</p><p>The long spear did not stop, it was as fast as lightning.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The youth from the ten direction Sword School shouted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>An earth-shattering shout suddenly came from the distance.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The chest of the youth from the ten directions Sword School was pierced through by the spear, and a huge hole was blasted open. His body fell to the ground, and his blood scattered in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a violent air-piercing sound was heard, and a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>This figure was also a young man in his twenties.</p><p>“Qiu changlie! It’s Qiu changlie!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed when they saw the young man.</p><p>Qiu zhanglie’s name had shaken the entire blazing sun Empire during this period of time. It was because he had defeated one of the six heroes, Ling Yanchi, not too long ago that he had become unparalleled in the limelight.</p><p>Some people had already spread the rumor of the seven heroes of the scorching sun because of him.</p><p>Qiu changlie’s face darkened. He glared at Lu Ming and said,”You’re tianyun? You actually dared to kill a genius of my ten direction Sword School. Do you know how big of a crime you’ve committed? Do you know that this is a great crime that will result in the extermination of nine generations of your family?”</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and said,”they’ve tried to kill me several times, so I can’t kill them?” I don’t care if you’re from the ten directions sword sect or the nine directions sword sect. Anyone who dares to offend me will be killed! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>kill! the three words resounded in the air. They were filled with killing intent and sent chills down one’s spine.</p><p>How dare you! You’re looking down on the ten direction Sword School! You must be beheaded!</p><p>Qiu changlie shouted as a beam of sword Qi shot out of his body and into the sky.</p><p>“Cut your sister! If you want to fight, then fight. Why do you have so much nonsense to say? Now, I’m officially challenging you.”</p><p>Lu Ming howled madly, his voice rumbling and spreading in all directions.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Tianyun actually wanted to challenge Qiu changlie? Was he crazy?</p><p>Although he had displayed incredible combat strength, and the two martial ancestor realm 2-dan youths were unable to resist him, he was still a powerful man.</p><p>However, no one believed that he was a match for Qiu changlie.</p><p>Qiu changlie was a peerless genius secretly nurtured by the ten direction Sword School. Once he was born, he defeated Ling Yanchi, one of the six heroes of the burning sun Empire. He was extremely powerful and could be said to be standing at the peak of the younger generation of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>How long had it been since tianyun rose to power? Not long ago, he was only at the great Martial Master realm. How could he be Qiu changlie’s match?</p><p>“Tianyun, you can’t!”</p><p>At this moment, a long howl came from the distance, and a few figures rushed over.</p><p>It was Hua Chi and a few elders from the imperial family.</p><p>The elders and Hua Chi quickly arrived.</p><p>“Tianyun, don’t be rash. This is the imperial capital. Let’s see what Qiu changlie can do to you.”</p><p>Hua Chi called out.</p><p>It was not that he did not trust Lu Ming. On the contrary, he trusted Lu Ming very much. He believed that it was very possible that Lu Ming would surpass the six scorching sun heroes in a year or two.</p><p>However, he did not believe that Lu Ming could defeat Qiu changlie. It was too unbelievable.</p><p>“Hua Chi, what are you doing? Don’t think that you can stop me just because you’re some Bullsh * t Prince. If you anger me, I’ll kill you as well. Now, get out of my way!”</p><p>Qiu changlie looked at Hua Chi and chided.</p><p>From his tone, he did not put Hua Chi in his eyes at all.</p><p>how dare you disrespect the eighth prince!</p><p>An old man shouted from the edge of the pool.</p><p>“Old thing, what are you shouting for? So what if I’m disrespectful? What can you do to me? Let me tell you, today tianyun killed a gold rank disciple of our ten direction sword sect. His crime is unforgivable, and no one can save him.”</p><p>Qiu changlie was extremely arrogant as he glared at Hua Chi and the others.</p><p>Hua Chi and the other elders had ugly expressions.</p><p>hey, are you done with your nonsense? I challenged you just now. If you don’t f * cking dare to accept the challenge, just say it. Don’t try to change the topic here and talk nonsense!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Qiu changlie was arrogant, but this tianyun was even more arrogant and Savage than Qiu changlie.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>Qiu changlie’s face turned ashen, and he almost vomited blood. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down and said coldly,”Fine, I agree to fight you. It’s a life-and-death battle. No outsiders are allowed to interfere.”</p><p>good, that’s just what I want. I’m really afraid that if I accidentally kill you, the old man from the ten direction Sword School will come to me for revenge!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Hahaha, tianyun, what do you think the ten direction Sword School is? Don’t worry, if you really can kill me, it’ll be because my cultivation is not enough. My ten direction sword sect will not pursue this matter. But let me tell you, it’s impossible for you to kill me. I’ll let you know what despair is!”</p><p>Qiu changlie laughed with confidence.</p><p>His voice spread far and wide, and everyone heard it.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. He took a step forward and appeared in the air, standing opposite Qiu changlie.</p><p>“Lu Ming has broken through to the martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>Seeing this, Hua Chi’s mind stirred. A hint of surprise appeared in his eyes, followed by a hint of joy.</p><p>He understood Lu Ming very well. Lu Ming would never fight a battle that he was not confident in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a huge combat sword flew out and hovered above Qiu changlie’s head. A terrifying sword Qi spread out in all directions, covering Half the Sky.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Qiu changlie bellowed. His sword trembled and turned into a terrifying sword ray that slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword Qi was fused with an incomparably powerful force.</p><p>The momentum of the mountain, the momentum of the mountain that had reached the great completion, caused the attack power of the sword ray to reach its peak.</p><p>The two golden disciples from the ten directions Sword School were trash compared to him. There was no way to compare them.</p><p>The sword light slashed down, terrifying and shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. The demon subduing spear appeared in his hand and he thrust the spear forward.</p><p>The true Qi in his body continuously gathered at the tip of the spear. At the same time, the power of wind and Fire also gathered and compressed at the tip of the spear.</p><p>This was the sixth move of the fire gun art, explosion.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had modified it to merge the Wind and Fire forces.</p><p>The power of wind and Fire had been condensed to the extreme, but it was still not completely fused. However, its power was already very shocking.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. A terrifying force suddenly burst out from the tip of the spear.</p><p>The two forces met in the air.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
