I hope that everyone can attend it. The challenges for today will end here.”</p><p>“An auction?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and he showed a look of interest.</p><p>Then, he walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, I’m starting to admire you more and more. Do your best in three days. When that time comes, you’ll break the record of the six heroes of the scorching sun and your name will shake the entire blazing sun Empire!”</p><p>As soon as he got off the fighting ring, Ming Feng ran over impatiently and said excitedly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Among the six heroes, the other five had won four consecutive victories across two levels, while Qiu changkong had won seven consecutive victories across two levels.</p><p>Could he break through?</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was not confident.</p><p>Sometimes, it also depended on luck. If one was two levels higher and encountered geniuses on the level of the six heroes of the scorching sun, it would be difficult to win.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and did not think too much about it.</p><p>The three of them left the arena and walked towards the general Star Hall.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, the DI Tian auction will be held the day after tomorrow. Do you want to go?”</p><p>Ming Feng asked.</p><p>“Of course I’m going.” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>then let’s go together. I’ll call my sister!</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He pondered for a moment and said,”Ming Cheng, Ming Feng, you guys go back first. I still have something to do.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ming Cheng and Ming Feng nodded and returned to the general Star Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the market.</p><p>The Ditian auction could be considered as one of the side businesses of the Ditian battle arena. It was not held frequently and was usually held once every half a year. However, many precious treasures would appear every time. Lu Ming was also rather tempted.</p><p>However, he had less than 200000 spiritual crystals on him now, which was too little. If he found a treasure that he liked and didn’t have enough spiritual crystals to buy it, he would be vomiting blood.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming planned to sell all the miscellaneous items he had on him.</p><p>He had all kinds of smithing materials, spiritual herbs, pills, spiritual weapons, and many cultivation methods and martial arts techniques on him. They piled up into mountains and Lu Ming had no use for them.</p><p>He planned to sell them all.</p><p>After arriving at the market, Lu Ming went into each shop and sold a portion of the goods.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming had sold all the items.</p><p>He had sold those things for a total of 300000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>In addition to the spiritual crystals he had on him before, he had almost 500000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>500,000 Yuan should be enough.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to the dormitory.</p><p>The next day, a piece of news spread wildly in the imperial capital.</p><p>The unparalleled genius of the general stars Hall, tianyun, will be challenging a person two levels above him at the Ditian battle arena. He has the hope of breaking the record of the six scorching sun heroes.</p><p>This news caused a huge commotion the moment it spread.</p><p>Challenge the record of the six heroes of the scorching sun? No one had been able to do it in the past few years.</p><p>Countless people were discussing and guessing.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming had also heard the news.</p><p>The first thing that came to Lu Ming’s mind was the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>This news was definitely released by the DI Tian battle arena. There was no other reason other than to let more people go and watch the battle three days later.</p><p>How many spiritual crystals could the Ditian battle arena earn in that case?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. This Di Tian battle arena was too good at seizing opportunities to make money.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care.</p><p>A day passed by quickly.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming, Ming Chen, Ming Feng, and Ming Zhu headed to the Ditian auction house.</p><p>The Ditian auction house wasn’t far from the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>young master tianyun, you are a distinguished guest. Please follow me to the guest room!</p><p>The moment Lu Ming’s group of four arrived at the Ditian auction house, an incomparably beautiful young lady welcomed them.</p><p>“Vip room?”</p><p>The four of them were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He guessed that this was the doing of the Ditian martial arts arena. Of course, he would not reject it.</p><p>The four of them followed the young lady and arrived at a vip room.</p><p>The Ditian auction house was divided into two parts. One was the main hall, which was where the ordinary bidders sat.</p><p>On the second floor above the main hall, there were rooms for distinguished guests surrounding the main hall.</p><p>In the VIP room, the environment was elegant, and there were tea, fruits, and snacks. It was comfortable and quiet.</p><p>Those who could enter the VIP room represented their status.</p><p>The four of them entered vip Room No. 7. They sat in the VIP room and looked outside through the glass.</p><p>There were at least fifty thousand people in the hall.</p><p>Furthermore, the number of people was still increasing.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Ming Feng looked outside excitedly.</p><p>the treasure later is the most important. Even if we can’t afford it, it’s still good to broaden our horizons.</p><p>Mingzhu said with a smile.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming with a complicated expression. She knew that if it were not for Lu Ming, how would the three of them be qualified to enter the VIP room?</p><p>Half a year ago, she had also been here, but only in the hall.</p><p>After a moment, an old man in a white robe walked up to the high platform in front of the hall.</p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p>“I am du Zhi, the host of this auction. Thank you all for coming. Now, the auction will officially begin. First, let’s bring out the first item of the day.”</p><p>The white-robed old man said in a clear voice.</p><p>Then, a beautiful woman with a curvy figure brought out a Jade plate. On the Jade plate, there was a piece of red metal.</p><p>“Everyone, I’m sure you’ve already seen that this is a piece of Red Rock spirit iron, the best material to forge a level 4 spiritual weapon. The starting price is ten thousand spiritual crystals, and each increment must be no less than a thousand spiritual crystals!”</p><p>Du Zhi announced.</p><p>10000 crystals? so expensive!</p><p>Ming Feng was secretly speechless.</p><p>“This is a material that can be used to forge fourth level spiritual weapons, so of course it’s expensive.”</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>As du Zhi’s voice fell, someone immediately made a bid.</p><p>“I bid 11000 spiritual crystals!”</p><p>“I’ll pay 12000!”</p><p>…</p><p>Slowly, the price rose to 22000 dollars, and it was bought by an old man.</p><p>next is a bottle of elixir, which is very useful for Grandmaster realm martial artists. The starting price is 800 spiritual crystals, and each bid must be no less than 100 spiritual crystals!</p><p>Then, it was the second item.</p><p>It was impossible for every item to be as expensive as the first one, which cost tens of thousands of spiritual crystals. Not many Warriors below the martial arts Grandmaster level could afford it.</p><p>“I’ll pay 1000 spiritual crystals!”</p><p>“I bid 1100 dollars!”</p><p>Soon, a group of martial grandmasters began to bid.</p><p>Lu Ming sipped his tea while watching.</p><p>Lu Ming was not interested in pills that could increase the cultivation of a martial Grandmaster.</p><p>This kind of pill would have some effect on ordinary martial artists, but to him, the effect was very small.</p><p>It was far less effective than buying Yao cores to refine.</p><p>However, it was different for others. They didn’t have a heaven-defying bloodline like the spirit-devouring bloodline. It was very rare for them to have elixirs that could improve their cultivation base.</p><p>Soon, the price of the elixir was raised to 2000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>“2100 dollars!”</p><p>Mingzhu also began to bid, her eyes revealing a look of desire.</p><p>“Two thousand two hundred dollars!”</p><p>However, someone immediately added it.</p><p>“Two thousand three hundred dollars!”</p><p>“Two thousand five hundred dollars!”</p><p>The price continued to rise.</p><p>Ming Zhu sighed. This price was too high for her, and she could only give up helplessly.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
