He couldn’t even think of one.</p><p>it seems like you didn’t. Then go to hell!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me!”</p><p>Suddenly, Baichi kneeled down and cried, ” “Tianyun, please spare my dog life. In the future, no matter what you want me to do, I’ll agree to it. From now on, I’ll be your slave, and you can order me around.”</p><p>“Be my slave? Are you even worthy?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from his body and pressed toward bai chi and the young man in green.</p><p>Baichi felt like he was being crushed by a mountain, and it became difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>“Ah, it’s not that easy to kill me.”</p><p>At this moment, the young man in the green robe roared and burst out with all his strength, rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to trade his life for a chance of survival.</p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The dazzling spear pierced through the air and went through the green-robed youth’s forehead.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and the red and white matter splattered all over bai Chi’s face.</p><p>Bai chi screamed in fear. At this moment, he felt hopeless and helpless.</p><p>The green-robed young man was more powerful than him, but he was killed by Lu Ming in one move. He did not even have the courage to resist.</p><p>“Ah, ah, don’t kill me. I was wrong, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have offended you. I was wrong.”</p><p>Bai chi shouted hysterically.</p><p>At this moment, he was filled with regret. He regretted offending Lu Ming. Lu Ming was not someone he could offend.</p><p>“It’s all Bai Long’s fault. It’s all his fault. Why did we have to provoke this monster? it’s all his fault.”</p><p>Baichi roared in his heart. He was blaming everything on Bailong.</p><p>If not for Bai Long, how would he have offended Lu Ming?</p><p>“What trash, you’ve really dirtied my hands.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Yes, yes, killing me would be dirtying your hands. Yes, you’re right!”</p><p>Baichi seemed to have grabbed onto the last life-saving straw as he yelled out.</p><p>“But, if I don’t kill you, I won’t be at ease.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered again, his voice exuding a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>Just as bai chi was about to shout, a ray of spear light flashed and disappeared into bai Chi’s forehead.</p><p>Baichi, dead!</p><p>“Now, it’s time for you to hand over your storage rings, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>The faces of the disciples from the omnipresent sword sect turned pale. They had witnessed Lu Ming’s terrifying combat strength and ruthlessness with their own eyes.</p><p>However, they were disciples of the ten direction Sword School and were usually high and mighty. Now, they were actually going to hand over their storage rings. This was simply a great humiliation.</p><p>“Tianyun, if you do this, the ten direction sword sect will not let you off.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not going to hand it over. Then I’ll come and take it myself.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and his figure flickered like a ghost.</p><p>The disciple from the omnipresent sword sect was already severely injured by Lu Ming. He had no way of resisting and had his storage ring removed by Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming casually grabbed and threw the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect. They were thrown up and fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>Then, the second one was stacked on top, and it got higher and higher like a human pyramid.</p><p>The last one was Gao tiankuo. After Lu Min removed his storage ring, Lu Ming gave him a kick and he flew high into the air, landing on top of more than thirty Shifang sword sect disciples.</p><p>More than thirty disciples of the ten directions Sword School were stacked up to a height of more than ten meters.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and appeared at the highest point. He stepped on Gao tiankuo’s body and waited.</p><p>The thirty or so disciples of the ten directions Sword School roared in anger, but it was of no use.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming raised his head and looked into the distance.</p><p>“Finally, it’s here!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>In the distance, many figures were leaping and approaching at an extreme speed.</p><p>There were more than two hundred people.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect had sent all the remaining people from the star Hall to the blood ant nest.</p><p>The figure flickered, and soon, he was nearby.</p><p>“Tianyun, that’s tianyun!”</p><p>“That’s my Shifang sword sect’s junior Brother. Damn it, how did they lose to tianyun?”</p><p>“Damn it! How could tianyun treat them like this? damn it!”</p><p>The eyes of nearly two hundred disciples from the omnipresent Sword School turned red when they saw this scene. Cold killing intent emanated from their bodies as they glared at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>In another direction, more than twenty students from the general Star Hall were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.</p><p>“This … Isn’t this tianyun a little too overbearing?”</p><p>tyrannical, I think he’s looking for death. We’d better stay away from him.</p><p>The students of the general stars Hall were discussing.</p><p>“Brother tianyun!”</p><p>Ming Cheng was among them. He shouted and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Ming, stay away from me and just watch the show.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at Ming Cheng and waved his hand.</p><p>Ming Cheng could not help but stop in his tracks. It was as if Lu Ming’s words had a magical power that he could not reject. Even he did not realize it.</p><p>“Tianyun, move your stinky feet and let go of my Shifang sword sect’s senior brothers.”</p><p>“Tell me, what despicable method did you use to sneak attack an expert from my ten directions Sword School?”</p><p>damn it, you’ll die 10000 times for your behavior, you know? ”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School continued to shout.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with them. He called out for a while and slowly stopped.</p><p>I told them to hand over their storage rings, but they didn’t. That’s why they ended up like this. Now, hand over all your storage rings, or else, you’ll end up like this.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s calm voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect were stunned.</p><p>The students of the general stars Hall were also stunned.</p><p>Tianyun was robbing, robbing the disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>Crazy, crazy, tianyun had gone crazy.</p><p>Everyone roared in their hearts.</p><p>Tianyun actually wanted to Rob nearly two hundred people from the ten direction sword sect by himself. If he wasn’t crazy, what was?</p><p>Tianyu, it seems like you’ve been hiding for a few days. You’ve really gone mad. But no matter what, you’re dead for sure today.</p><p>A thin and tall figure walked out from the crowd of people from the ten direction sword sect. He exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized this person. He was one of the six people from the ten directions sword sect who had comprehended force.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, another two young men walked out. Their auras were no weaker than the thin and tall young man’s.</p><p>The two of them had also comprehended force.</p><p>The three of them glared at Lu Ming with killing intent, ready to attack at any moment.</p><p>don’t be careless. This person’s combat strength is not to be underestimated. You’d better join forces and kill him.</p><p>Gao tiankuo, who was at Lu Ming’s feet, shouted.</p><p>The expressions of the people from the ten directions sword sect changed.</p><p>They initially thought that Lu Ming had used some despicable means to hurt Gao tiankuo and the rest. However, it seemed that things were not that simple.</p><p>Could Lu Ming really be that powerful?</p><p>The three leaders hesitated.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
