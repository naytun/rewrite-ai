With just one move, he had sent the crooked-mouthed young man flying in a brutal manner, causing him to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“The second move!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Lu Ming did not stop his attack, and the second shot followed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the spear swept past, the space trembled violently. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The power of this spear was even stronger than the previous one.</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man was horrified. He roared and exploded with all his strength, using that defensive martial skill with all his might.</p><p>The Battle Sword spun and sword circles appeared one after another, floating in front of the crooked mouth young man.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s eyes were red as he roared.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>However, as the long spear swept past, all the sword circles collapsed instantly. The long spear directly hit the crooked-mouthed young man’s combat sword.</p><p>A terrifying force exploded. The crooked-mouthed young man’s combat sword actually exploded into pieces with a bang.</p><p>The crooked-mouth young man let out a blood-curdling screech. The bones in his body made a series of crackling sounds, and it was unknown how many bones had been broken.</p><p>“The third move! I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The cold voice was heard again.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>The crooked mouth youth shouted.</p><p>“How dare you! Stop!”</p><p>A young man on one of the ten direction sword sect’s observing pillars shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear did not stop. It turned into a flash of lightning and pierced through the heart of the crooked-mouthed young man.</p><p>With a thump, it was nailed to the ground.</p><p>“What the f * ck? you actually dare to kill me?”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man let out a roar of unwillingness and disbelief.</p><p>I said I’ll kill you in three moves. There won’t be a fourth move!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The crooked mouth young man’s eyes revealed an extremely frightened expression. He let out a loud roar of unwillingness and stopped breathing.</p><p>“Junior Brother!”</p><p>how dare you kill the geniuses of my ten direction Sword School? you’re courting death!</p><p>“I’m going to tear you into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>The surrounding disciples of the ten direction sword sect roared, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>let’s attack. First, we’ll cripple his cultivation. Then, I’ll break all his bones and hang him at the gate of the general stars Hall. We’ll let everyone know the consequences of offending the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>It was still the young man on the observing pillar. This young man had long blue hair and was extremely evil.</p><p>He stared at Lu Ming coldly and said, ”</p><p>Of course, the other geniuses on the clairvoyant pillars were also looking at Lu Ming coldly. They just did not say anything.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the green-haired young man finished speaking, at least twenty or so disciples of the omnipresent sword sect unsheathed their long swords around Lu Ming, and streams of sword Qi flashed out.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More than twenty disciples of the omnidirectional Sword School attacked at the same time. The violent sword Qi, more than twenty violent sword Qi, instantly drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>The long spear swept across and let out a terrifying howl. More than 20 sword Qi were instantly destroyed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. Like an unparalleled demonic god, he charged forward with the spear in his hand.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>More than twenty explosions rang out in succession, and more than twenty disciples of the ten directions Sword School were sent flying, coughing up blood.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>He was too powerful. Lu Ming was too powerful.</p><p>It was a crushing defeat. The other party had no way to resist. In front of Lu Ming, the twenty-odd people were as weak as babies.</p><p>“Why is there such an expert in the general stars Hall?”</p><p>Many people from the ten direction sword sect roared in their hearts.</p><p>Even yang Zaitian’s eyes had a trace of seriousness.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on top of the green-haired young man’s head, looking down at him.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear lashed out in a very direct and overbearing manner.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the green-haired young man shouted coldly. A green sword appeared in his hand and he swung it. A huge Green Bear pounced at Lu Ming with a roar.</p><p>The green bear’s palms were as big as a table and it continuously smacked Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion and the green bear collapsed. The spear continued to smash down.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The green-haired youth’s eyes flashed with disbelief.</p><p>He was a top genius and was famous even in the ten direction Sword School. He was not someone other disciples could compare to.</p><p>Being qualified to occupy one of the observing pillars was enough to explain everything.</p><p>He initially thought that no matter how strong Lu Ming was, he would be able to fight him. However, the moment they fought, he realized that he was wrong. He was terribly wrong.</p><p>He was no match for them.</p><p>He was directly sent flying by the surging power.</p><p>BOOM! Lu Ming’s spear hit the observing pillar directly. In an instant, the observing pillar was shattered into pieces.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>At this moment, the entire place fell silent. It was as if the space had frozen.</p><p>After a long while, he let out an earth-shaking roar.</p><p>“How dare you! How dare you destroy the ten direction sword sect’s clairvoyant pillar? You’re dead!”</p><p>“Kill, we must kill him!”</p><p>“Grind his bones and scatter his ashes!”</p><p>Almost all the disciples of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>Although the gazing-horizon pillar was useless, it represented the face of the omnidirectional sword sect. Lu Ming’s shattering of the gazing-horizon pillar was equivalent to slapping the faces of all the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect in public.</p><p>How could they not be angry?</p><p>Even yang Zaitian and a few other young men from the omnipresent sword sect who had been very calm all this while were looking at Lu Ming with gloomy expressions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Five to six powerful auras pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>These five to six youths had actually all comprehended force.</p><p>There were indeed many geniuses in the Shifang sword sect. There were actually five or six people below the seventh grade great Martial Master realm who had comprehended force.</p><p>Those who could comprehend force at the Martial Master realm were one in ten thousand, extremely few.</p><p>However, even a great Martial Master comprehending force was no small matter. They were definitely rare geniuses.</p><p>“Heavens, there are actually so many people from the ten direction Sword School who have comprehended force. Tianyun is finished. No matter how strong he is, he’s not a match for these monsters.”</p><p>Someone from the general stars Hall shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura of the six geniuses from the omnidirectional sword sect who had comprehended force pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he was about to release his aura to resist.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard.</p><p>In the sky, the red-haired old man flew over quickly. He emitted a terrifying aura and blocked the aura of the six young geniuses from the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>“What are you doing, eccentric red? Do you want to attack the disciples of my ten directions Sword School? I’ll exchange a few moves with you!”</p><p>Following closely behind, Qiu Wuzhi also arrived at the scene.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s eyes scanned the surroundings and when he saw the broken observation pillar, his expression changed and he shouted, ” “Who is it? He broke the observing pillar?”</p><p>“Elder, it’s that kid.”</p><p>“He also killed Junior Brother Hu!”</p><p>A disciple from the omnipresent sword sect pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to shatter my ten direction sword sect’s boundary-observing pillar? You even killed the heroes of my Shifang Sword School, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi bellowed and sent a palm strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>The powerful strength of a martial arts Grandmaster was undoubtedly on display. His palm was like a mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The red-haired old man moved as well. He threw out a punch and blocked Qiu Wuzhi’s palm energy.</p><p>“Eccentric red, do you want to start a war?”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi bellowed.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi, your Shifang Sword School also killed one of my general stars Hall’s disciples, so we’re even now.
