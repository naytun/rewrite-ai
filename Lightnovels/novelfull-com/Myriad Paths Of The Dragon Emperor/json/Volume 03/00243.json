If there were no challengers on the spot, the Ditian battle arena would send an expert.</p><p>The Ditian battle arena’s strength was unfathomable. Naturally, it had raised a group of experts. The experts sent by the Ditian battle arena were known as death fighters.</p><p>Just from the name, one could tell that the death Warriors were all powerful and fearless people.</p><p>If he attacked, he would definitely see blood.</p><p>“Tianyun, please wait a moment.”</p><p>The judge said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>In a luxurious room at the highest point of Ditian battle arena, there was a window that allowed one to view the entire Ditian battle arena.</p><p>At this moment, there were a few old men watching.</p><p>“This tianyun is extremely powerful. It’s time to send out the death Warriors.”</p><p>One of the black-clothed elders said.</p><p>that’s right. However, ordinary death Warriors are definitely not tianyun’s match. I suggest that we let eighteen go first. If eighteen can’t win, then we’ll let seventeen go.</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The other old men nodded.</p><p>Then, they passed down the order.</p><p>Not long after, an extremely tall and strong man covered in scars rushed into the fighting ring.</p><p>The burly man’s entire body was filled with a murderous aura. His eyes were like those of a wild beast as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>The word “eighteen” was carved on the man’s face.</p><p>“Number 18 is Ditian battle arena’s death Fighter. Furthermore, it’s number 18.”</p><p>When the audience saw this big man, they all exclaimed in shock.</p><p>it’s said that only the death Warriors with extremely strong combat strength are qualified to have words carved on their faces. It’s said that there are five strongest seventh grade great martial masters in the Ditian battle arena, from 16 to 20. This 18 is one of them.</p><p>“Seems like the Ditian battle arena really values tianyun.”</p><p>of course! If tianyun were to win ten consecutive victories, he would have to pay 90000 spiritual crystals. How could the Ditian battle arena let tianyun win so easily? ”</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>wonderful! The 10 spiritual crystals today were so well spent. I guess those who didn’t come will regret it to death.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered slightly and he looked at eighteen.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense a strong murderous aura from the other party.</p><p>“Di Tian battle arena’s death Warriors? It’s finally getting interesting.”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. A hint of fighting spirit flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve got to be careful. Eighteen won’t show any mercy.”</p><p>The judge was kind to a genius like Lu Ming and he reminded him.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, let’s begin!”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With the judge’s announcement, eighteen let out a beast-like roar. With a move of his hand, a meteor hammer appeared. The meteor hammer let out a terrifying howl and smashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The meteor hammer was a strange weapon. It was very difficult to master, but once it was mastered, it would be very powerful.</p><p>The meteor hammer was like a shooting star, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not Dodge. Instead, he thrust his spear.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>The tip of the spear accurately pierced the meteor hammer, making a deafening sound.</p><p>The long spear did not move at all, but the meteor hammer was sent flying back at a speed even faster than before.</p><p>Eighteen’s ferocious expression changed drastically. He leaped up high and dodged the meteor hammer. The meteor hammer slammed onto the fighting ring, emitting a violent boom. If it wasn’t for the inscription formation inscribed by the experts of the Ditian battle arena, it would have exploded.</p><p>this 18 is probably comparable to an ordinary eighth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, an ordinary eighth grade great Martial Master was nothing in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After that, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of eighteen like a ghost. He then swept his spear at eighteen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Eighteen blocked with the iron chain but it was useless. Lu Ming’s spear hit her directly. She flew more than a hundred meters away with the meteor hammer before she stopped.</p><p>He had won. Tianyun had won. He had won in a clean and direct manner.</p><p>The entire audience looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>They were not surprised that Lu Ming would win. However, they were shocked that Lu Ming won so easily.</p><p>At the highest point of the Ditian battle arena, the few old men watched, their eyes glimmering.</p><p>this tianyun is definitely a peerless genius. He’s a demonic-level peerless genius. Only other peerless geniuses who are one level higher than him can fight him. It’ll be very difficult for anyone else to stop him.</p><p>An old man sighed.</p><p>that’s right. I feel that this tianyun hasn’t even used most of his strength. Even if sixteen were to go up, she wouldn’t be his match.</p><p>“Then let him obtain ten consecutive victories?”</p><p>of course, this is a good thing. When the time comes, as long as we operate a little, we’ll be the ones to make a big profit.</p><p>“Haha, that’s right. Then, let seventeen and sixteen go up.”</p><p>Not only were the elders not unhappy, their faces were filled with joy.</p><p>Next, a man with a seventeen-year-old carved on his face came up. He was still no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Nine consecutive wins.</p><p>After nine consecutive wins, a girl in her twenties came up. The word ” sixteen ” was engraved on her face.</p><p>This woman’s strength was a whole lot stronger than the previous seventeen and eighteen. She had actually comprehended force.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was still a far cry from yang Zaitian. He was no match for Lu Ming at all. Lu Ming’s power of fire burst out and he defeated his opponent easily.</p><p>Ten consecutive wins. Lu Ming had challenged someone one level higher and achieved ten consecutive wins.</p><p>According to the rules, he could get 90000 spiritual crystals as a reward.</p><p>“Tianyun, do you wish to continue the challenge?”</p><p>The judge looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming. Their eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>If he continued to challenge, he would have to cross two levels.</p><p>Although it was rare to have ten consecutive wins against someone one level higher, there would still be one every once in a while.</p><p>However, there were very few people who could cross two levels and defeat them.</p><p>For a battle that was two levels higher than him, he would be rewarded 100000 spiritual crystals for one win, and for every victory he won, he would be rewarded with an additional 100000 spiritual crystals. How tempting was this?</p><p>However, there were too few people who could obtain it.</p><p>The current six heroes of the scorching sun were all geniuses who had challenged opponents two levels above them and won.</p><p>Among the six heroes, five of them had four consecutive victories across two levels.</p><p>Only the leader of the six heroes, Qiu changkong, the peerless genius of the ten direction Sword School, had achieved a record of seven consecutive victories across two levels.</p><p>It was also the burning sun Empire’s highest achievement in the past hundred years.</p><p>Would tianyun accept it?</p><p>“I choose to continue the challenge.”</p><p>Lu Ming said without hesitation.</p><p>90,000 crystals was too little for 10 consecutive wins.</p><p>Crossing two levels was Lu Ming’s goal. He was tempted by the rewards and he would not miss it.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The scene was in an uproar as everyone became excited.</p><p>Tianyun had agreed to continue the challenge. There was going to be a good show to watch.</p><p>It was not common to see a challenge that was two levels higher.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the judge revealed a happy smile and said, ” “Tianyun, we’ll need to arrange for people to take on the challenge that’s two levels above us. We can’t start it immediately, and it’ll take three days. Are you willing to do so?”</p><p>“Three days later?” Lu Ming was stunned. He then nodded in agreement.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
