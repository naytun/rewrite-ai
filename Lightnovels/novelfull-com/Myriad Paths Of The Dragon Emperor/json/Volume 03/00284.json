What’s a mere king level third rank bloodline?”</p><p>“Hmph, now take my palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and struck out with his palm. A black palm print formed with terrifying power.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw out a palm as well. His essential Qi surged and formed a huge palm print, which collided with Xie nianqing’s Black palm print.</p><p>With a loud bang, the two of them trembled and took a step back.</p><p>“You’ve broken through to the second level of the martial ancestor realm?”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Before Xie nianqing’s breakthrough, he had consumed 20 bottles of Yiyuan ancient panaceas and broke through to the early stage of the second grade martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t think that I can’t step on you just because you’ve broken through to the second stage of the martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as his body glowed with a blood-red light. He was about to activate his bloodline.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse appeared beside Xie nianqing and glared at her with its mouth wide open.</p><p>Xie nianqing shrieked and quickly stepped back, ” “Lu Ming, you’re shameless.”</p><p>“So what if I’m shameless? Every day, you say that you will step on me. Today, I will step on you. Hehe, do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled coldly. With a light shout, he pounced on Xie nianqing.</p><p>At the same time, the Golden-eyed blood corpse growled and pounced on Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body glowed with a blood-red light as he was about to activate his bloodline. However, the Golden-eyed blood zombie charged forward and a blood-red light shot towards Xie nianqing, interrupting the activation of her bloodline.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming pounced forward and sent a palm strike into Xie nianqing’s dantian, temporarily sealing her essential Qi and restraining her.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing screamed and struggled with all his might.</p><p>“What are you shouting for?”</p><p>Lu Ming used some force and Xie nianqing’s essential Qi was temporarily sealed. How could he resist? he was restrained by Lu Ming and could not move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me go. Otherwise, I won’t let you off.”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted.</p><p>hehe, now that you’re completely in my hands, you still dare to threaten me. It seems that I was too honest in the past. I need a beating!</p><p>Lu Ming said and then gave him a lesson.</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I hate you. I’ll definitely trample you under my feet.</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>In the end, she gritted her teeth and cursed in a low voice, looking as if she was ready to let him do whatever he wanted.</p><p>However, as she scolded, her tears started to flow down.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was a little helpless. He quickly let go of Xie nianqing and said, ” “Hey, why are you crying? I haven’t even done anything yet!”</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s cry was like a river that had its gates opened, and he couldn’t stop crying.</p><p>She was crying so sadly and pitifully. Her tears flowed like a string of pearls and fell to the ground.</p><p>It was as if she had a great grievance that she wanted to vent out through this cry.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a loss for words. He felt as if he had done something wrong.</p><p>But he hadn’t done anything yet.</p><p>So, he could only stay by her side.</p><p>After a long while, Xie nianqing finally stopped crying. He stared at Lu Ming in a daze for a long time before he suddenly gritted his teeth and said, ” “Hmph, Lu Ming, I’ll let you off for today. One day, I’ll trample you under my feet.”</p><p>“This again?”</p><p>Lu Ming was completely speechless.</p><p>“I’m leaving, are you coming?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Hmph, of course we’re going. Don’t even think about escaping.”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. The two of them left the Stone Forest.</p><p>Of course, the Golden-eyed blood zombie was also with them. However, Lu Ming took out a very large black robe and a bamboo hat for the Golden-eyed blood zombie to put on, as it would be too conspicuous.</p><p>The two of them randomly chose a direction and advanced. Along the way, they encountered a few blind martial artists who were easily dealt with by Lu Ming.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a bell came from the distance and reverberated in the world.</p><p>No one knew how far the bell came from, but it sounded like it was ringing right next to their ears.</p><p>what a wondrous sound. What does this mean? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head and did not say anything.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. Essential Qi gushed out of him as he soared into the sky and flew in the direction of the bell.</p><p>After stepping into the martial arts Grandmaster realm, he could finally fly as he pleased.</p><p>Xie nianqing and the Golden-eyed blood corpse moved and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A moment later, the second bell chimed.</p><p>It sounded similar to just now, but Lu Ming and the rest were clearly a distance away from the location of the bell.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest continued to fly towards the source of the bell.</p><p>A moment later, the bell rang for the third time.</p><p>The volume of the sound was the same as the previous two, as if it was right beside his ear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From time to time, the sound of the air being cut could be heard in the air. Not only Lu Ming and the rest, but the others also heard the bell and headed in the direction of the bell.</p><p>Not long after, the fourth bell rang. At that moment, Lu Ming and the rest saw a huge mountain.</p><p>This mountain was so tall that it reached the clouds. It was extremely majestic.</p><p>And the bell was ringing from the top of this mountain.</p><p>When they arrived at the foot of the mountain, they discovered that the mountain was blocked by a layer of light screen, and they couldn’t enter at all.</p><p>At this moment, hundreds of young experts had gathered at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A flash of sword light appeared, and a young man wearing a swordsman’s robe stopped in the air.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Some of them recognized Duan Ling from the Dark Moon’s nine heroes.</p><p>Following that, experts appeared from time to time.</p><p>Other than Duan Ling, two of the blood Zhao Empire’s 50 super rookies had also appeared.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The bell was long and would ring once every moment.</p><p>When the eighth sound rang out, a demonic-looking young man with his hands behind his back walked over from the air.</p><p>“Yang Liuji is here,”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Even the Super rookies of the blood Zhao 50 had their expressions changed and became extremely serious.</p><p>The geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking were too strong.</p><p>At this moment, more than a thousand people had gathered at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A moment later, the ninth Bell chimed.</p><p>When the ninth Bell rang, the light screen shrouding the mountain trembled and actually dissipated, turning into nothing and revealing the mountain’s true appearance.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
