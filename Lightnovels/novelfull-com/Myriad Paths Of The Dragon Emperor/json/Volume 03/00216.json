He’s really a cultivation maniac.”</p><p>Ming Feng pouted his lips speechlessly and continued, the blood ant secret realm is a plane jointly controlled by the royal family and the ten direction Sword School. It opens once every three years, and the three-year period will be in a month’s time. The general Star Hall has already issued an order that anyone above the third grade great Martial Master realm must participate. Anyone below the third grade great Martial Master realm can also participate if their combat strength has reached the third grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>many second grade great Martial Master realm martial artists are cultivating with all their might, hoping to reach the third grade great Martial Master realm and enter the blood ant secret realm. After all, this is a great opportunity that no one wants to miss. Big brother tianyun, how could you not know about it? ”</p><p>After Ming Feng finished speaking, he pouted.</p><p>“As expected, it is the same thing as Hua Chi said.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Of course I’ve heard of it. I’m going to participate.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>no martial artist above the seventh grade Grandmaster realm can enter the blood ant secret realm. With brother tianyun’s combat strength, you’ll definitely have a great harvest. However, you still have to be careful of the people from the Shifang Sword School, because every time, the disciples of the Shifang Sword School will wantonly hunt the geniuses of the general Star Hall.</p><p>Mingzhu said in a deep voice.</p><p>Hmph, the people from the ten direction Sword School better not mess with me. Otherwise, I’ll kill every one of them who comes!</p><p>Ming Cheng snorted coldly, killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he asked, ” “Are seventh grade great martial masters and above really not allowed to participate?”</p><p>yes, I’ve only heard about it. It’s said that the secret realm is a newly-born plane, probably around ten thousand years old. The laws of heaven and earth are not perfect. The higher the cultivation, the greater the rejection. Seventh grade great Martial Master and above will be rejected as soon as they enter.</p><p>Mingzhu explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>If seventh grade great Martial Master realm and above couldn’t enter, he wouldn’t be afraid no matter how talented and strong the disciples of the ten direction Sword School were.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. Come, come, let’s exchange some pointers!”</p><p>At this moment, Ming Cheng shouted.</p><p>He stared at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Then, they found a wide space.</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>“Ah, ah, tianyun, you pervert! I’m not going to fight with you anymore! I’m not going to spar with you anymore! You pervert!”</p><p>Ming Cheng screamed in pain. His face was bruised and purple. He looked at Lu Ming with a bitter expression.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He thought to himself,’you are the one who insisted on sparring with me.’</p><p>Ming Feng and Mingzhu were dumbfounded.</p><p>This was the first time they had seen their big brother being beaten up so badly and screaming so miserably.</p><p>He even shouted that he would not look for Lu Ming to spar in the future. This was really one of a kind.</p><p>don’t, brother Mingcheng. I’ve learned a lot from sparring with you. We’ll continue another day. At most, I’ll go easy on you.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … “Ah!” I have a stomachache, so I’m going to leave first.”</p><p>Ming Cheng almost burst into tears. He held his stomach and ran away, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Behind them, Lu Ming, Ming Feng, and Mingzhu were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Is this still my big brother? I didn’t get the wrong person, right?”</p><p>Ming Feng muttered.</p><p>“It’s not that you’ve got the wrong person, or someone’s too abnormal.”</p><p>The Pearl rolled her eyes at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>…..</p><p>During this period of time, the atmosphere in the general Star Hall was extremely intense. Everyone who had a chance of entering the blood ant secret realm was cultivating hard in the hopes of increasing their combat strength and obtaining greater gains in the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>After resting for two days, Lu Ming returned to the God Wind Valley. He realized that there were many more people cultivating in the God Wind Valley. In the crisscrossing valleys of the God Wind Valley, one could see a figure every once in a while.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the place where he had cultivated previously. There was no one there.</p><p>No one could cultivate here. This was what Lu Ming wanted. No one would disturb him.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was time for the blood ant secret realm to open.</p><p>Lu Ming left the Holy Wind Valley a day earlier. The next day, he and Ming Cheng arrived at the general Star Hall’s martial arts field.</p><p>All the students from the general stars Hall who wanted to enter the blood ant realm had to gather here.</p><p>Soon, more than 120 people had gathered on the field.</p><p>This was the total number of people from the general stars Hall who had entered the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>Each of them had a cultivation between the third and sixth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A few old men appeared in the air.</p><p>“I believe everyone knows a little about the rules this time, so I won’t go into detail. I’ll mainly talk about the most important points.”</p><p>One of the red-haired old men spoke. His aura was turbulent, and his voice was like a great Bell.</p><p>first, the blood ant secret realm opens once every three years. This time, it’s time for the blood ant eggs again. The blood ant eggs are the best materials for refining the blood refining pill. For every three blood ant eggs, one blood refining pill can be refined. As for you, as long as you hand over the blood ant eggs you obtain to the royal family, you will get half of them.</p><p>“In other words, as long as you hand over six blood ant eggs, the royal family will give you a blood refinement pill.”</p><p>blood refinement pill, it’s actually a blood refinement pill? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes glowed with passion.</p><p>Before a martial artist awakens his second bloodline, he would go through a process of accumulation. What would he accumulate? It was to accumulate the Qi of the bloodline.</p><p>The more concentrated the bloodline energy was, the higher the level of the second bloodline that could be awakened.</p><p>The blood refinement pill was a treasure that could accumulate the Qi of bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood. The treasure that Hua Chi had mentioned that could help him awaken his second bloodline was the blood refinement pill.</p><p>It was not just Lu Ming. Everyone else present, including those geniuses who thought they could break through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm, had a burning glow in their eyes.</p><p>As long as he obtained six blood ant eggs, he could exchange them for a blood refinement pill.</p><p>second, I want to warn you that you must be careful of the disciples of the ten directions Sword School. Every time the secret realm opens, the disciples of the ten directions Sword School will hunt down the general stars Hall. Killing and plundering are not forbidden in the secret realm, so you must be careful.</p><p>The red-haired old man’s voice sounded again. He warned with a serious expression.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if they’re geniuses from the ten direction Sword School? why would I be afraid of them?”</p><p>Some of the students were full of confidence as they said.</p><p>alright, that’s all I have to say. The rest will be up to you. Let’s go to the blood ant secret realm now.</p><p>As soon as the red-haired old man’s voice fell, a few screeches were heard in the sky, and eight huge Gale Eagles descended.</p><p>These eight windwalk Eagles were much larger than the ones Lu Ming had seen in East lacking city.</p><p>As the gale Eagle landed, everyone leaped into the air and jumped onto its back.</p><p>With eight long howls, the gale Eagle soared straight up, heading north.</p><p>The blood ant secret realm was located to the North of the imperial capital, about 20000 miles away.</p><p>It was said that the blood ant secret realm originally belonged to the royal family, but the ten direction sword sect took over a part of the power and demanded an equal share of the blood ant secret realm with the royal family.</p><p>Every three years, both sides would send their disciples into the blood ant realm to harvest the blood ant eggs. Whoever obtained them would get them.</p><p>This condition seemed fair, but it was not fair at all.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
