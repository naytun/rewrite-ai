How many crystals for one?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast blood essence, 25000 spiritual crystals for one portion!</p><p>The shopkeeper replied.</p><p>Silk banner</p><p>Although he was mentally prepared, Lu Ming still secretly gasped.</p><p>The blood essence of a class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast cost 25000 spiritual crystals. That was terrifying.</p><p>young master, the higher the level of the demonic beast blood essence, the harder it is to collect it. Furthermore, the cost of preserving it is very high. This price is not high!</p><p>The shopkeeper explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Of course, he understood this logic.</p><p>“How many do you need, young master?”</p><p>The innkeeper asked.</p><p>“Let’s start with twenty portions!”</p><p>Lu Ming said after thinking for a while.</p><p>“What? Twenty servings for two?”</p><p>The shopkeeper cried out in alarm, the fat on his face jiggling rapidly.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Don’t you have that many?” Lu Ming frowned and asked.</p><p>“Yes, yes, definitely!”</p><p>The shopkeeper shouted excitedly. He knew that a big customer had come today.</p><p>Most inscription Masters would only buy a few portions of demonic beast blood essence to refine pills and weapons. Why would they buy so many?</p><p>Furthermore, those who would purchase the blood essence of Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beasts were usually inscription Masters above the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>It was extremely rare to buy 20 sets of Class 9 Level 3 demonic beast blood essence at once.</p><p>The shopkeeper was so excited that his heart was trembling.</p><p>“I’ll immediately send someone to get it!”</p><p>The shopkeeper called out and then sent someone to get it.</p><p>“Shopkeeper, may I know how much a class 9 third level demonic pill is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You still want to buy Yao cores?” The shopkeeper was even more delighted. He quickly replied, ” a class 9 Lv 3 demonic pill is much cheaper than the blood essence of demonic beasts. Demonic pills are easy to store and contain more impurities than blood essence. It’s usually one-fifth the price of blood essence of the same level. One class 9 Lv 3 demonic pill costs about 5000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Alright, give me 30!”</p><p>Lu Ming said without thinking.</p><p>“Alright, please wait for a moment, young master. I’ll immediately send someone to bring it over.”</p><p>After saying that, the shopkeeper quickly got up and walked out.</p><p>After a while, the shopkeeper came in with a few young girls, carrying a few Jade boxes.</p><p>“Young master, the blood essence and monster core that you wanted!”</p><p>The shopkeeper said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look. There were twenty portions of ninth grade third level demonic beast blood essence and thirty ninth grade third level demonic cores. Not a single portion was missing.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in satisfaction. He then took out a storage ring and handed it to the shopkeeper. Shopkeeper, there are 650000 spiritual crystals here. Please count them.</p><p>The shopkeeper took it and scanned through the storage ring. His smile became even more brilliant, young master, since you bought so many at once, we have a special discount. We will only charge you 600000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>also, this is the VIP card of our shop. The next time you come, you will get a 20% discount on all items.</p><p>The shopkeeper took out a Golden VIP card and 50000 spirit crystals and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and accepted it without any hesitation.</p><p>Since he could save 50000 spirit crystals, Lu Ming would not stand on ceremony. Furthermore, he would get a 20% discount when he bought things in the future. This was very tempting to Lu Ming.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he put away the blood essence and monster core.</p><p>At the side, a few beautiful young girls looked at Lu Ming, their eyes shining.</p><p>He had offered 600000 spirit crystals in one go. In their hearts, Lu Ming was a high and mighty figure.</p><p>“How good would it be if I could gain the favor of such a person?”</p><p>The few young girls thought to themselves. However, they knew that it was impossible. How could a person like Lu Ming be interested in them?</p><p>“Shopkeeper, farewell!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his hands and strode away.</p><p>Lu Ming did not feel any heartache at spending 600000 spirit crystals in one go. After all, he had obtained them from the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>Once he returned to the dormitory, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and could not wait to start cultivating.</p><p>First, Lu Ming controlled his Blood Meridian and swallowed a portion of ninth grade third level demonic beast’s blood essence. Then, he began to refine it with all his might.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not use it to improve his cultivation. Instead, he used all the energy in the blood essence to improve the level of his Blood Meridian.</p><p>The demon core was enough to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Two hours later, the blood essence was completely refined.</p><p>On his bloodline, there were six blood-red Meridian cycles that were extremely dazzling. However, a seventh Meridian cycle had yet to be born.</p><p>In addition to the three blood ants ‘blood essence, he had devoured four class 9 Lv 3 demonic beasts’ blood essence in total. However, his bloodline level had not increased.</p><p>The difficulty of upgrading the bloodline level was evident.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out another blood essence of a ninth grade third level demonic beast and began to devour it.</p><p>After devouring it, he took out another one.</p><p>Just like that, he continuously devoured fifteen portions of demonic beast blood essence, all of which were used to improve his bloodline. At this time, his bloodline trembled and finally, the seventh blood-red chakra was born.</p><p>When the seventh blood-red chakra was born, the snake-like spirit-devouring bloodline roared towards the sky. Its whole body glowed and expanded rapidly.</p><p>It became thicker and longer.</p><p>In the end, it turned into a giant python that was about ten meters long and floated above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>it’s evolved. My soul-devouring bloodline has evolved again.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>His soul-devouring bloodline had evolved once when he had advanced to rank 4.</p><p>That time, it evolved from a finger-sized worm into a small snake.</p><p>And now, it had evolved from a small snake to a giant python.</p><p>Then, what would he become if he continued to evolve?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>The giant python roared and opened its mouth, releasing a powerful devouring power that was several times stronger than before.</p><p>“Continue to devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out another portion of demonic beast blood essence. However, this time, it only took half an hour for it to be completely refined. His seventh Meridian cycle became brighter.</p><p>Lu Ming then refined the remaining four portions of demonic beast blood essence in one go.</p><p>I wonder how much blood essence I will have to consume if I want to raise my bloodline to level eight.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming then took out a demonic core and began to devour it.</p><p>Refining a demonic pill was much more troublesome than refining blood essence. However, now that the devouring power of the Spirit-devouring bloodline had been greatly enhanced, it would not take much time to refine it.</p><p>In three hours, he had refined one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved, but not by much.</p><p>He continued refining.</p><p>After refining five pills, Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced from the early stage of the sixth grade great master realm to the middle stage.</p><p>The amount of energy required to improve was greater than what Lu Ming had imagined.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>In the next three days, Lu Ming refined a total of twenty demonic cores. His cultivation had already reached the peak of the sixth grade great master realm.</p><p>He was just one step away from breaking through to the seventh grade great master realm.</p><p>However, at this point, Lu Ming had refined a few demonic cores in a row, but it was to no avail. It was difficult for him to break through to the seventh grade great Martial Master.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that he had reached a bottleneck. During this period of time, he had improved too quickly and his realm could not keep up.</p><p>He had to stop and experience tempering and fighting before he could continue improving.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
