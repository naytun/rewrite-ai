Shui shuihen screamed as he tried his best to avoid the anteater’s attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear arrived in an instant.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The water current was like a leather ball as it was sent flying, leaving a trail of blood along the surface of the lake.</p><p>He let out a shrill scream. Half of his body had almost exploded, and one of his arms was missing.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his eyes filled with killing intent as he chased after them.</p><p>“No, tianyun, you can’t kill me. I’m the top genius of the ten direction Sword School. If you kill me, you won’t have a good end either.”</p><p>Shui shuihen was almost scared out of his wits as he screamed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was firm and he was unmoved.</p><p>tianyun, let me go! I beg you to let me go! If you want the flood dragon fruit, I’ll give it to you! Shui liuhen was almost in despair.</p><p>“If I kill you, the flood dragon fruit will also be mine.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was indifferent. The long spear turned into an electric light and shot out.</p><p>“I’m not afraid.”</p><p>Lu Ming! Shui shuihen shouted. But just as he shouted, Lu Ming’s spear pierced through his throat.</p><p>Water current mark, dead!</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi gushed out and he sucked Shui liuhen’s storage ring over, storing it in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Of course, Shui liuhen’s blood essence was also devoured.</p><p>At that moment, the two anteaters charged at Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s figure flashed, avoiding the two anteaters ‘attacks and sprinting toward the shore.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>On the shore, the remaining ten direction sword sect disciples turned pale with fright and turned to run.</p><p>Even Shui liuhen had been killed. If they stayed, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>There were also a few students from the general Star Hall, some of whom were even the top ten experts of the outer hall. However, they were looking at Lu Ming with horrified gazes. They did not dare to stay any longer and turned to run away.</p><p>They were afraid that Lu Ming would go crazy and kill them.</p><p>Lu Ming rode on the waves. No matter how the two anteaters attacked, they could not touch a single hair on his body.</p><p>“It’s a pity there are two of them. If there was only one, I would like to fight it!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>With his current combat strength, he really wanted to fight with them. However, since there were two of them, he decided to forget about it. He didn’t want to waste time.</p><p>Lu Ming leaped across the lake and collected the storage rings of the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect and the students of the general Star Hall. At the same time, he devoured their blood essence.</p><p>“I’m done playing with you guys!”</p><p>After he was done looting, Lu Ming let out a long laugh. His figure shot up into the sky like the wind, hundreds of meters high. He stepped on the air and arrived at the shore.</p><p>The two anteaters shrieked, but they didn’t give chase.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming turned around and left. After traveling fifty miles, he stopped. He clenched his fist in the air and a storage ring appeared in his hand.</p><p>This storage ring was Shui liuhen’s.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to look at it. Indeed, the flood Dragon Spirit fruit was lying quietly in the storage ring.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the flood Dragon Spirit fruit appeared in his hand, emitting a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>Lu Ming took a whiff and felt that the true energy in his body seemed to be running faster.</p><p>“What a powerful medicinal effect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>Then, without hesitation, he swallowed the flood Dragon Spirit fruit and began to refine it.</p><p>The serpent spirit fruit’s energy was extremely terrifying. The moment it was swallowed, it turned into a huge amount of energy that flowed into his limbs and bones.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and cultivated it with all his might.</p><p>Lu Ming was charging towards the fourth stage of the true war Dragon technique with all his might.</p><p>Originally, breaking through to the fourth level would require six extremely precious natural treasures and more than a dozen supplementary materials. However, there was no need for that now. A flood dragon fruit was enough.</p><p>With the refinement of the flood dragon fruit, the true Qi of the true war Dragon technique was constantly condensed and rich.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he opened his eyes. He could not help but let out a long roar that sounded like a Dragon’s Roar.</p><p>Fortunately, it was in the Supreme shrine. If it were outside, the news would definitely spread for dozens of miles.</p><p>“True war Dragon technique, fourth stage, breakthrough!”</p><p>Lu Ming slowly raised his right hand and clenched it gently. The air in his palm was grasped by Lu Ming and a crackling explosion was heard.</p><p>his true Qi is rich and condensed. It’s five times that of a normal martial artist. So strong!</p><p>Feeling the surging essential Qi in his body, Lu Ming had a satisfied smile on his face.</p><p>“Now, let’s look at the harvest!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of storage rings. He did a quick calculation and found that there were a total of forty-two rings.</p><p>These were all storage rings left behind by geniuses who were third grade great Martial Master and above. Lu Ming was very much looking forward to the items inside.</p><p>He opened them one by one and counted them.</p><p>Finally, he sorted out all the items and piled them up in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>There was a small pile of all kinds of spiritual herbs, but most of them were not very high grade.</p><p>All kinds of elixirs were stored in Jade bottles, and they were piled up in a large pile. They were definitely valuable.</p><p>There were also various ores, materials from demonic beasts, spiritual weapons, etc. Lu Ming sorted them out and put them away.</p><p>In addition, there were stacks of silver notes, which added up to hundreds of millions of taels. This was a huge amount, and even if it was exchanged for spiritual crystals, it would be tens of thousands of pieces.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming the most was not these, but the spiritual crystals and the blood ant eggs.</p><p>There were more than 80000 spiritual crystals, which filled several big boxes.</p><p>He also had 536 blood ant eggs.</p><p>It was much more than what Lu Ming had received during this period.</p><p>hahaha, these resources are enough for me to use for a while. On the third platform, form a figure to fight with me. As your cultivation level increases, you will need more and more spiritual crystals. I don’t have to worry about it for now.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>On the third platform, he had to condense a figure with the same combat strength as himself. When Lu Ming was a first grade Grand Master, he needed nine spiritual crystals.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the number of spirit crystals he needed also increased.</p><p>He needed eighteen for the second grade of the great master realm, thirty-six for the third grade, and the number kept increasing.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the fifth grade Grand Master realm, he would need 144 pieces to condense that figure.</p><p>This was too extravagant. One time, only six hours, and he already needed 144 pieces. As his cultivation level increased, he would need even more. How could an ordinary person afford it?</p><p>In the past few months, Lu Ming had used up thousands of spiritual crystals to condense the figure to fight with him.</p><p>Without the replenishment this time, Lu Ming would not be able to sustain for long with the spiritual crystals he had.</p><p>it’s still faster to Rob others. It’s much faster than working hard to obtain resources.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Rob others?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Yes, robbery.</p><p>Since the people from the ten direction Sword School wanted to kill him, why should he be polite?</p><p>“Haha, good, let’s do that. I’ll wait for them at the blood ant nest.”</p><p>After making up his mind, Lu Ming laughed and left the Supreme shrine, heading towards the center of the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
