Clearly, Lu Ming’s ability was beyond her expectations.</p><p>“Good, you’re quite strong. You’ll be able to fight me.”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“You’re crazy, I don’t have time to accompany you.”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He then soared into the sky and dashed into the distance at top speed.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and kicked off with his legs. His body seemed to be weightless as he chased after Lu Ming at an incredible speed. He was not slower than Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He activated his midair steps to the maximum and walked in the air. In an instant, he was hundreds of meters away. Not long after, he left the imperial capital and headed Northwest.</p><p>Behind him, Xie nianqing followed closely. He could also walk in the air for a short time.</p><p>this b * tch is really sick. Forget it, if you want to follow, then follow!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He let her follow him while he used his body movement technique and moved forward at top speed.</p><p>The lonely wasteland was located at the Northwest border of the burning sun Empire. It was a vast, dead wasteland that spanned three empires.</p><p>It was the border of three empires.</p><p>To the North was the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>To the Northwest was the blood Zhao Empire, a mid-tier Empire.</p><p>Empires were divided into low-tier empires, middle-tier empires, high-tier empires, and Supreme-tier empires according to their strength.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire and the Dark Moon Empire were both low-tier empires.</p><p>Emperor Yun’s thirty-six empires included eight middle-tier empires, while the rest were all low-tier empires.</p><p>A middle-tier Empire was at least ten times stronger than a low-tier Empire.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation, it would take him four to five days to reach the Forsaken desolation land.</p><p>After a day and a night, Lu Ming’s essential Qi was insufficient. He stopped to meditate to recover.</p><p>Not far behind them, Xie nianqing was also panting heavily. He stopped and sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>“He’s really persistent!”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming’s essential Qi had fully recovered. He saw Xie nianqing standing up.</p><p>“How about this, I really have something urgent to attend to. After I’m done with this, I’ll have a fight with you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Hmph, who knows where you’ll run off to when the time comes? you treated me like that in the past, and I said that I’ll definitely trample you under my feet. I said that, and I’ll definitely do it. Don’t even think about running away, I’ll follow you. When you’re done with your business, I’ll teach you a good lesson.</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This lady’s temper was too strange, right?</p><p>“Forget it, forget it. If you want to follow, then follow.”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued on his way. Xie nianqing followed him from the side.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four days had passed, and the desolate wilderness was already in sight.</p><p>He stood on the peak of a mountain and looked into the distance.</p><p>The desolate wasteland was extremely vast, like a giant beast lying in front.</p><p>The two of them took a step forward and headed towards the desolate wilderness.</p><p>Only after entering the forsaken land did he realize that it wasn’t completely dead. He could see patches of trees and weeds.</p><p>However, these trees and weeds didn’t have leaves and looked lifeless.</p><p>The surroundings were completely silent. Not even the chirping of insects or the chirping of birds could be heard.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not dare to be careless. This was because the Forsaken desolation was a well-known danger zone that contained great danger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the two of them saw a huge black Tiger running through the wild forest.</p><p>The Tiger’s aura was powerful. It was a class 2 Lv 3 demonic beast.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, a black mist suddenly flew down from a leafless tree in front of the Tiger. The black mist rolled towards the Tiger and then flew away, disappearing into the tree.</p><p>A Tiger-shaped skeleton was left behind.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s scalps turned numb.</p><p>They had seen clearly that the black mist that had flown out of the tree was a kind of tiny ants. However, there were too many of them and they were terrifyingly powerful. The giant Tiger, a class 2 Lv 3 demonic beast, had turned into a skeleton before it could even scream.</p><p>The desolate wilderness was indeed strange, so he had to be extra careful.</p><p>The two of them continued to move forward, and there were no mishaps along the way. Soon, they were more than three hundred miles deep.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>All of a sudden, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. In a flash, eight figures appeared in front of Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>The two of them froze and stopped.</p><p>the ten direction sword sect is here on business. We’re temporarily commandeering this area. Please go back!</p><p>The leader of the group, a middle-aged man, said.</p><p>His tone was overbearing.</p><p>hehe, since when did the Forsaken desolation land belong to the ten direction Sword School? this is the first time I’ve heard of it.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“If I say it’s ours, then it’s ours. Kid, don’t be unreasonable. Otherwise, this place will be your burial ground.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes turned cold, and his body emitted a faint killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming was not wearing his bamboo hat at the moment. It was obvious that the people from the omnipresent sword sect had not seen Lu Ming before and did not recognize him.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the people from the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>The burly man in the lead had an extremely thick aura and was at the 1-dan martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>The other seven were all ninth grade great martial masters.</p><p>It was obvious that the ten direction sword sect had mobilized a large force to capture Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming said and turned to leave.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flickered. Without saying anything, he turned and left with Lu Ming.</p><p>Behind him, the middle-aged man from the ten directions sword sect had a strong killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>“These two people are suspicious. I’d rather kill them wrongly than let them go. Kill them!”</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Immediately, the two ninth grade Grandmaster realm experts unsheathed their swords and charged at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>He was extremely fast and instantly appeared behind the two of them. The broad combat sword slashed down at their heads.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing suddenly turned around.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a long spear appeared. It pierced through the ninth grade Grandmaster who was charging at him.</p><p>With a snap of Xie nianqing’s fingers, the man’s head flew high into the air and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly surprised. He could tell that Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached ninth grade Grandmaster realm. It seemed that Xie nianqing had some kind of fortuitous encounter during this period of time. Otherwise, his cultivation would not have improved so quickly.</p><p>It was because of his spirit-devouring bloodline that his cultivation base had skyrocketed.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing didn’t have the spirit-devouring bloodline, yet his cultivation breakthrough was no slower than his. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“I knew you would do this!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked coldly at the remaining people from the omnipresent sword sect. In an instant, the two experts were killed, causing the middle-aged man and the others to be stunned. Then, they roared in anger, ” you dare to kill the disciples of my ten direction Sword School? you’re looking for death! Kill, kill them!</p><p>The middle-aged man exuded a terrifying aura as he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The remaining five ninth grade Grandmaster realm martial artists charged at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“First level of the martial ancestor realm. It’s a good time to test my strength.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He shook his long spear and charged at his opponent.</p><p>During this period of closed-door cultivation, he had gained a lot. His combat strength had increased rapidly, and he did not know what level he had reached.</p><p>He had fought two times previously. The first time was against a peak ninth grade great Martial Master, and the second time was against two geniuses at the peak second grade martial Grandmaster. The first time was too weak, and the second time was too strong. It was not a good test of Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>This 1-stage martial ancestor realm was just right.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
