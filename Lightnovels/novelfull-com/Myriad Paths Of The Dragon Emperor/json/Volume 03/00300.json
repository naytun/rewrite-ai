They had come all the way to Mount han.</p><p>In front of them was the thousand li Cold Mountain. As long as they crossed this thousand li Cold Mountain, they would reach Moonview city, which was a four to five day journey.</p><p>“Let’s go into the mountains and set up camp!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave the order.</p><p>The twenty thousand strong Army advanced towards Mount han.</p><p>After a few dozen miles, they found a flat area to set up camp and had dinner.</p><p>As night fell, the roars of beasts could be heard from the thousand li of Mount han.</p><p>Lu Ming asked some of them to patrol and some to rest.</p><p>Late at night, more than twenty figures were leaping at high speed in the thousand li of the cold mountains.</p><p>More than twenty people, all wearing black robes, moved at a terrifying speed, like ghosts in the forest at night.</p><p>Not long after, more than twenty figures appeared not far from Lu Ming’s Army, looking at the military camp.</p><p>“According to the news, the burning sun royal family has sent out only young experts this time. The general is also a young man. He’s a peerless genius named tianyun. As long as we kill tianyun and the other young geniuses, this Army will be crippled.”</p><p>A few black-robed men were discussing.</p><p>I’ve heard that tianyun is a genius on the same level as the scorching sun’s six heroes. Leave him to me!</p><p>A black-robed man with a Golden Moon embroidered on it said.</p><p>The others nodded. This Golden Moon black-robed man was the strongest among them.</p><p>“Come, let’s get closer!”</p><p>Jinyue waved her hand, and more than twenty people followed her like ghosts towards the camp.</p><p>They didn’t emit any aura, and they didn’t make any sound as they walked.</p><p>It was silent!</p><p>It stopped a thousand meters away from the military camp.</p><p>one of the tents is emitting the aura of a 3-stage martial ancestor realm expert. That person should be tianyun. I’ll go kill him, you guys go and kill the others!</p><p>The black-robed Jinyue ordered.</p><p>The others nodded. Under the moonlight, their figures actually became hazy, and they disappeared without a sound.</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man was the fastest. He easily passed through the layers of checkpoints and arrived in front of a tent.</p><p>A young man was sitting cross-legged in the tent. He was none other than Hua Ying.</p><p>Among the many young powerhouses, his cultivation was the highest. He had reached the later stage of the third level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. The Golden Moon black-robed man naturally thought that he was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Genius? Die!”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Jinyue’s eyes. A slender black sword appeared in her hand. She and the sword turned into a Black Lightning and stabbed toward Huaying.</p><p>Huaying, who was sitting cross-legged in cultivation, suddenly felt a terrifying aura of death envelop him. All the hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Huaying’s spiritual sense was extremely sensitive, and he had used it to avoid killing intent many times. At this time, he did not think and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Even so, he was still a step too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long sword pierced through his shoulder. As blood splattered, Huaying roared and an Eagle appeared above his head. This was his bloodline. The eagle’s wings flapped rapidly, and he retreated.</p><p>you’re quite capable. You actually managed to avoid my sure-kill sword strike. But you still have to die!</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man sneered and charged at Huaying like a ghost.</p><p>At the same time, in another tent, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>In front of him, the tent suddenly split open, and a Dark Sword light stabbed toward his forehead at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“A second level martial ancestor realm assassin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not move, but he waved his right hand suddenly. A long spear was condensed instantly and stabbed forward.</p><p>His speed was much faster than that of a killer.</p><p>“How could this be?”</p><p>The assassin was so shocked that it was too late to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through his heart and the assassin was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out of the tent and appeared in the sky.</p><p>In the military camp, there were several screams. A young master had been assassinated.</p><p>There were also young experts who were fighting with the assassins.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and saw Xie nianqing’s figure flash across the sky. Behind her, there was a corpse.</p><p>He swept his gaze again and saw that Golden Moon black was chasing after Hua Ying. He was in danger and could be killed at any moment.</p><p>“Golden Eye, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered the Golden-eyed blood corpse. The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared in anger and pounced at the assassins.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a long spear appeared. Then, he threw it out. The long spear turned into a bolt of lightning and shot toward the Golden Moon black-robed man.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, Golden Moon Black’s men had already closed in on Hua Ying, their cold killing intent enveloping Hua Ying.</p><p>Hua Ying’s body turned cold. He had a feeling that he would die under the sword of the Golden Moon black-robed man in the next moment.</p><p>This feeling almost suffocated him. He roared in his heart. no, I can’t die. I can’t die. I still have to revitalize the Hua family!</p><p>However, he had just been stabbed by the sword, and the terrifying sword Qi had continuously penetrated his entire body. He felt waves of weakness.</p><p>Jinyue’s Black-robed figure instantly closed in.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man laughed coldly and thrust his sword at Huaying.</p><p>This sword was even faster than the previous one. It was incomparably sharp and unstoppable.</p><p>Huaying couldn’t block it at all.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Huaying roared, her heart filled with despair.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A bolt of lightning broke through the air, fast to the extreme.</p><p>It was a long spear that was condensed from true energy.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear struck the Golden Moon black-robed man’s long sword, causing a violent tremor.</p><p>Jin Yue’s Black-robed figure trembled, and his body couldn’t help but drift to the side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved. In the next moment, he passed by Huaying and headed towards Jinyue’s Black-robed man.</p><p>Huaying cast a complicated look at Lu Ming. Lu Ming had saved him just now.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man let out a low roar. The power of Lu Ming’s move had exceeded his expectations. He was shocked that he was forced back even with his sixth level martial arts Grandmaster cultivation.</p><p>“Tianyun!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>Jinyue’s pupils suddenly contracted, and she said in a deep voice, ” “So you’re the real tianyun?”</p><p>“You know me? You were sent by the Dark Moon Empire, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he asked.</p><p>“So what if you know? I’m here today to send you to your death.”</p><p>Jinyue sneered. The sound of his sword rang out. He became one with his sword and turned into a ray of sword light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and thrust it forward.</p><p>The body of the spear was wrapped in the power of wind and Fire. The power of wind and Fire had completely fused.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear and the sword light collided.</p><p>Waves of powerful shockwaves spread out. Then, Jinyue let out a muffled groan, and her body was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>As he flew back, the Golden Moon black-robed man roared in his heart.</p><p>He could tell that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the second level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, while he was at the sixth level.</p><p>But the result was that a second level martial ancestor realm sent him flying with one move. How was this possible? Such a thing actually existed in the world?</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man was shocked.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
