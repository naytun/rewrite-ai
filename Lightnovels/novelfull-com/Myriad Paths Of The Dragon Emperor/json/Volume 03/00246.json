There aren’t many of them, only nine drops!” Du Zhi explained with a smile.</p><p>“Nine drops? That’s enough!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>On the other hand, some people looked excited.</p><p>The innate original fluid was too precious. Not many people could afford it if there were too many of them. However, if there were only nine drops, it was worth a try.</p><p>Moreover, even if there were only nine drops, the effect was still very shocking.</p><p>nine drops of primordial origin liquid. I want them. Lu Ming looked at the stone ball, his eyes filled with determination.</p><p>His body had been stuck at complete grade two for a long time and had not broken through. As long as he obtained the nine drops of innate origin liquid, his body would definitely advance by leaps and bounds. It would be easy for him to break through to grade three.</p><p>If that was the case, his combat strength would have a huge increase.</p><p>the nine drops of primordial origin liquid have been studied by the elders of the Ditian battle arena. There is no mistake. Alright, the bidding will begin now. The starting price for each drop of primordial origin liquid is 10000 spiritual crystals. Nine drops will make the starting price 90000 spiritual crystals. Each increment must not be less than 5000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>Du Zhi announced.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Many people gasped and looked dejected.</p><p>Even though he had expected this, he was still shocked when he heard the price.</p><p>90,000 spiritual crystals. Most of the People’s anger was extinguished.</p><p>“100000 spiritual crystals.”</p><p>Although the price was high, not everyone could afford it. Immediately, someone called out a bid from one of the VIP rooms.</p><p>From the voice in guest Room No. 3, he seemed to be very young.</p><p>“One hundred and ten thousand!”</p><p>Then, an old voice came from guest Room No. 9.</p><p>“120000!”</p><p>In the hall, a voice suddenly rang out. Everyone looked over and saw a tall and strong man.</p><p>“150000!”</p><p>In guest room number three, the young voice sounded, but it was a little cold.</p><p>“160000!”</p><p>Immediately after, the bidder from vip Room No. 9 followed suit.</p><p>In the hall, the burly man’s eyes flickered as he stared at the stone ball on the high platform. His eyes were filled with unwillingness.</p><p>But in the end, he let out a long sigh and gave up on bidding.</p><p>160,000 spiritual crystals was more than all his wealth.</p><p>He could only give up.</p><p>“170000!”</p><p>The bidder in vip Room No. 3 continued to raise the bid.</p><p>“One hundred and eighty thousand!”</p><p>Guest Room Number 9 did not give in at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not make a bid. There was no need to do so now. He would bid later. It was the same.</p><p>Honored guest Room No. 3 and honored guest Room No. 9 competed with each other. Very quickly, the price of the innate original liquid shot up to a high of 250000.</p><p>At this moment, the voice in guest Room No. 3 was extremely cold.</p><p>At this moment, five young men were sitting in guest Room No. 3.</p><p>However, the five young men’s expressions were not good.</p><p>where did this old man come from? how dare he compete with senior brother qiuming for the treasure? he’s really looking for death!</p><p>A young man with a slightly pale face said with killing intent.</p><p>that’s right. It seems like he doesn’t know that we’re disciples of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>The other man said coldly.</p><p>Among the five people, the one sitting in the middle was a handsome young man in a blue robe. His expression was very cold.</p><p>Frowning, he looked at vip room 9 and said, ” senior, I’m qiuming, a disciple of the ten direction sword sect. These nine drops of innate origin liquid are very useful to me. I hope you can give them to me.</p><p>His words were very polite, but his voice was cold and filled with killing intent. An extremely powerful aura spread out from guest room number three.</p><p>This was clearly a threat.</p><p>“A disciple of the ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>The people in the hall were all shocked, and their eyes revealed fear.</p><p>“A member of the Qiu family of the ten direction sword sect?”</p><p>An old voice came from the ninth vip room. An old man was sitting inside, but he looked scared.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Qiuming replied coldly.</p><p>forget it. I’ll give these nine drops of primordial origin liquid to you young people!</p><p>The old man in guest Room No. 9 pondered for a while and finally sighed.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect was a huge force in the blazing sun Empire, and not many people dared to offend them.</p><p>Qiuming smiled when the old man left.</p><p>“250000,250000. Any higher bids?”</p><p>Du Zhi looked around and asked.</p><p>“This is the innate original fluid. It’s very rare in the world, even in the blazing sun Empire. Its effect on the body is extremely amazing. If we miss today, who knows when we’ll get another chance? 250,000. Is there a higher bid?”</p><p>Du Zhi tried his best to tempt him.</p><p>Qiuming’s performance just now had made him very dissatisfied, so he naturally shouted to his heart’s content.</p><p>“This old man!”</p><p>Qiuming gritted his teeth and glared at du Zhi unhappily. If looks could kill, du Zhi would have been pierced through like a sieve.</p><p>“Three hundred thousand!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice suddenly rang out and spread throughout the entire place, causing everyone’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>Someone made a bid. Even after knowing that it was a disciple of the ten directions Sword School, he still dared to make a bid.</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes immediately turned to the seventh vip room.</p><p>That’s right, the one who bid just now was Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, he increased the bid by 50000 in one go, pushing the price to 300000.</p><p>“300000. Okay, this friend here bids 300000. Is there anyone higher than 300000?”</p><p>Du Zhi was overjoyed as he announced.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In guest Room No. 3, qiuming slammed his palm on the table and broke it into pieces. His face was extremely dark.</p><p>where did this blind brat come from? he clearly knows that we are disciples of the ten directions Sword School, yet he still dares to bid. Is he looking for death? ”</p><p>The pale-faced young man roared, and his voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>I bid 300000 spiritual crystals. Are you going to make another bid? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and said indifferently.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Qiuming finally couldn’t take it anymore and shouted, ” kid, I’ll give you five breaths to take back your bid. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you die an ugly death.</p><p>if you have money, pay. If you don’t have money, why are you still here chirping? get lost!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s response. It was strong and overbearing.</p><p>Everyone in the auction hall was shocked.</p><p>This mysterious person was actually so domineering that he told the ten direction Sword School to get lost?</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Qiuming’s face was livid with anger. A powerful aura spread out and enveloped The Seventh Guest room.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to kill you now.”</p><p>Qiuming roared.</p><p>“You can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded strongly.</p><p>The other party’s cultivation was at the eighth grade Grandmaster realm and was extremely powerful. However, what did Lu Ming have to fear?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Qiuming roared and walked out of the VIP room, heading for vip Room No. 3.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Suddenly, du Zhi roared out as an extremely terrifying aura exploded out, pressing down on qiuming like a mountain. Qiuming’s body trembled, and he could not move.</p><p>This was the aura of a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They did not expect this kind-looking du Zhi to be a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>“Old man, what are you doing? Are you looking for death? I’m a disciple of the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>Qiuming roared.</p><p>what dogshit ten direction sword sect? how dare you cause trouble in the Emperor sky auction house? kill!</p><p>Du Zhi shouted.
