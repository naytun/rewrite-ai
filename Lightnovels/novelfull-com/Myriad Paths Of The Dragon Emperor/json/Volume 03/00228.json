In addition, the two of them were originally the top ten experts of the general Star Hall’s outer hall and were very powerful, so their harvest was quite good. In the meantime, they even encountered an ant nest, which they cleared out.</p><p>Moreover, as long as they encountered disciples of the ten direction Sword School, no matter how strong or weak they were, they would stay far away, so they didn’t encounter any danger.</p><p>“Haha, the blood ant eggs we’ve collected this time are enough to exchange for a lot of blood refinement pellets. In the future, we’ll definitely be able to awaken a powerful second bloodline. At that time, the general Star Hall will be the world of the two of us.”</p><p>The green-robed youth laughed.</p><p>that’s right. That tianyun actually wanted to kill me. Unfortunately, he was too arrogant. He actually challenged all the experts of the ten direction Sword School. I think he would have been killed by the disciples of the ten direction Sword School long ago.</p><p>Baichi’s eyes revealed a ferocious look.</p><p>“We’re about to reach the blood ant nest. We’ll observe in secret and wait for the others to attack. There’s someone in front.”</p><p>As the green-robed young man was speaking, he suddenly froze and looked ahead.</p><p>“Someone’s there?”</p><p>Bai chi also looked over, and his expression changed drastically. He was so scared that he almost peed himself.</p><p>“Tianyun, why aren’t you dead yet?!”</p><p>Baichi let out a sharp cry.</p><p>“You’re not dead yet, so how could I die?”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and looked at bai chi coldly.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Baichi’s entire body trembled. He let out a low roar and ran back.</p><p>However, the green-robed young man’s reaction was even faster than bai Chi’s. He had already turned around and ran away.</p><p>“Baichi, I said I would kill you. Do you think you can escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He took a step forward and chased after bai chi like the wind.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Bai chi shouted. He felt his feet shaking and his body turning cold. He ran forward with all his strength.</p><p>“Wait for me!”</p><p>Bai chi shouted. The green-robed young man was faster than him.</p><p>Why would the green-robed young man pay attention to him? Outside the blood ant secret realm, he had also targeted Lu Ming. Now, he was also scared to death. Why would he stop?</p><p>Baichi felt a chill down his spine and his scalp went numb. He felt as if death was approaching him.</p><p>escape! I must escape! I can’t die!</p><p>Baichi roared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was getting closer and closer to him.</p><p>At this time, dozens of figures suddenly rushed over from the distance. They were all disciples of the Shi Fang Sword School.</p><p>Baichi’s eyes brightened and he was overjoyed. His speed seemed to have increased a little and he ran towards the people from the ten direction sword sect at full speed. He shouted,”Brothers from the ten directions sword sect, tianyun is here. Tianyun is here. He killed a disciple from your ten directions sword sect!”</p><p>Regardless of whether Lu Ming had killed him or not, he had to say that Lu Ming had killed him. Only then could he escape.</p><p>“Tianyun?”</p><p>There were more than thirty disciples of the ten directions Sword School in front of them, and the one leading them was senior brother Gao.</p><p>He was stunned for a moment, then revealed a cold killing intent and roared, ” “It’s tianyun! Hahaha! I’ve finally found him!”</p><p>Immediately, he dashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother Gao is so lucky!”</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions sword sect laughed and followed.</p><p>Seeing the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect coming, Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy. He was no longer in a hurry to kill bai chi and slowly walked forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Bai chi was ecstatic and let out a long breath.</p><p>brat, you may be from the general stars Hall, but since tianyun wants to kill you, I’ll protect you. Stand still!</p><p>Senior brother Gao gave bai chi a glance and ordered.</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Baichi nodded repeatedly, but he laughed in his heart, ” “Tianyun, the heavens have not forsaken me. Right now, the one who will die is you.”</p><p>Senior brother Gao looked away from bai chi and turned to Lu Ming with a cold killing intent. “Tianyun, you’ve been hiding from me for so many days. In the end, you’re still going to die by my hands. Remember my name, I’m Gao tiankuo.”</p><p>“Gao tiankuo, right? Very well, now, I declare that this is a robbery. Hand over all your storage rings.”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“What? What did you just say? A robbery?”</p><p>Gao tiankuo shouted, thinking that he had misheard.</p><p>nonsense! Hand over your storage ring or you’ll stay here forever!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>hahaha, tianyun, I think you’ve gone mad. I’m going to wake you up right now.</p><p>Gao tiankuo laughed.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Then, he took a step forward, and the earth rumbled. A powerful and heavy aura emanated from Gao tiankuo’s body. It was as if a mountain was standing there.</p><p>Force, the force of a mountain!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A huge sword appeared in Gao tiankuo’s hand. He strode toward Lu Ming like a mountain.</p><p>“Tianyun is dead!”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School sneered.</p><p>But the next moment, they were all stunned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A scorching and destructive aura rose from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A scorching aura gushed out, and the temperature within a 100-meter radius rose rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. It was like a shooting star falling from the sky and crashing into a mountain.</p><p>The mountain crumbled. Gao tiankuo let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew out like a rubber ball.</p><p>The entire place quieted down. Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Senior brother Gao, you lost? He was defeated in one move?”</p><p>“This … How is this possible?”</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions Sword School said in a daze.</p><p>Not far away, Baichi’s pupils contracted sharply and his face showed disbelief. the force of fire! Impossible! Absolutely impossible!</p><p>He found it hard to accept.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The aura on his body exploded and pressed down on the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>“Not good, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect shouted.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. The demon subduing spear glowed and condensed into a huge spear that was as thick as a water tank and a hundred meters long.</p><p>The huge spear pressed down, and a terrifying shock wave blasted down and exploded in all directions.</p><p>Screams and roars sounded. The disciples of the ten directions Sword School were sent flying like rubber balls and fell all over the place.</p><p>Only two people were still standing there.</p><p>Baichi and the green-robed young man.</p><p>At this moment, bai Chi’s face was deathly pale. His body and lips were trembling non-stop, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>He muttered to himself in disbelief.</p><p>Initially, he was overjoyed when he ran into the disciple of the omnidirectional Sword School. He thought that he was saved and that Lu Ming was dead for sure. He could not kill Lu Ming at all.</p><p>However, he had never dreamed that the thirty-odd disciples of the ten directions Sword School, including the top geniuses who had comprehended force, would be so easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>“Now, let’s see who can save you.”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward bai chi step by step, a mocking smile hanging on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me!”</p><p>Bai chi shouted, he didn’t have the courage to fight back.</p><p>“Don’t kill you? Hehe, you’re really naïve. Tell me, if you can give me a reason why I won’t kill you, I won’t kill you.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
