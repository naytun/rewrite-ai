He shot out a punch, and Wu Yuan was directly blasted off the fighting stage.</p><p>“Let’s continue. The second round, gouwei.”</p><p>The middle-aged elder began to announce.</p><p>One test after another continued.</p><p>However, the strength of the new students varied. Some of them were only at the warrior realm, and it was impossible for them to last more than 100 moves against the older students.</p><p>Of course, there were also exceptions. One of them had reached the third grade great Martial Master realm and defeated an older student, attracting a lot of attention.</p><p>Soon, it was Ming Feng’s turn.</p><p>However, Ming Feng’s cultivation was only at the sixth grade master realm. For his age, it was already very good, but he was no match for the senior student.</p><p>The other party had deliberately held back for more than 50 moves and then defeated Ming Feng easily.</p><p>“Next, tianyun,”</p><p>The middle-aged elder announced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Chen Xiong, come up and take the test!”</p><p>The middle-aged elder shouted.</p><p>“Chen Xiong, as expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he revealed a cold smile.</p><p>“It’s really Chen Xiong. It can’t be such a coincidence. He must have done something. Or, he must have been bribed.”</p><p>Mingzhu said in a low voice.</p><p>“Isn’t this too despicable? Why don’t we just ask big brother tianyun to give up on the test!”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“No, if you give up the test, you can’t stay in the general Star Hall.”</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>“Then what should we do? Sister, is that Chen Xiong really that powerful? No matter what, big brother tianyun is still a fourth grade great master.”</p><p>Ming Feng said anxiously.</p><p>Mingzhu sighed. of course Chen Xiong is strong. He can kill an ordinary fifth grade great Martial Master with a single sword strike. I heard that no less than three fifth grade great martial masters have died at his hands.</p><p>“That’s so powerful, what should we do?”</p><p>Ming Feng was even more anxious.</p><p>“There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll just have to see how tianyun’s good fortune will turn out.”</p><p>Mingzhu sighed.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>On the other side, Chen Xiong laughed heartily. He stepped onto the fighting ring and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Below the fighting stage, Hua Jie sneered. kid, you’re tianyun, right? you’ve managed to live for three more days. Now, accept your fate!</p><p>Hua Jie, you haven’t fought for a few days. Are your bones itching again? or, do you want to pee your pants again? ”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Hua Jie and said loudly.</p><p>His voice spread far and wide.</p><p>Hua Jie almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming was too detestable. He had touched on Hua Jie’s sore spot.</p><p>Hua Jie’s face was flushed red. He stared at Lu Ming with a sense of duty and roared, ” “Little bastard, scream all you want. This is your last chance. I’ll let you have a taste of your mouth. After all, you’re going to die soon.”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response. He could not be bothered to deal with Huajie, this Mad Dog.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, Chen Xiong unsheathed his long sword. A brilliant, blood-red sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>“Tianyun, I once used this sword to kill a fifth grade great Martial Master with a single strike. It’s your honor to die under my sword.”</p><p>Chen Xiong shouted loudly. His face was filled with pride.</p><p>you killed a fifth grade great master realm martial artist with a single sword strike, and you still have the cheek to brag about it? don’t you find it embarrassing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and said indifferently.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the people around him staggered and almost fell.</p><p>All of them looked at Lu Ming speechlessly.</p><p>Breaking the record? In Lu Ming’s eyes, a fourth grade great Martial Master killing a fifth grade great Martial Master with a single slash was actually a broken record and embarrassing?</p><p>This was a battle of a higher realm, and it was in the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>A great Martial Master who could cross realms and kill an opponent was definitely a top genius.</p><p>Bragging, he was definitely bragging.</p><p>Almost everyone thought that Lu Ming was bragging. Even Mingzhu and Ming Feng looked at each other in dismay.</p><p>“Go on, go on, I’ll let you brag as much as you want as a dying man.”</p><p>Hua Jie burst out laughing.</p><p>However, Chen Xiong’s expression was extremely ugly. The battle results that he had been so proud of were actually so pathetic in Lu Ming’s eyes. Whether he was bragging or not, in his opinion, this was an insult to him.</p><p>“Tianyun, wait a moment. I hope you can still say it.”</p><p>Chen Xiong’s voice was incomparably cold. He pointed his long sword and a surge of sword Qi gushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Chen Xiong shouted, his killing intent soaring into the sky.</p><p>He became one with the sword and turned into a blood-red sword light, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword Qi whistled as if it could cut the space in half. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>This was not a test or a spar. He was clearly trying to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The faces of the Pearl mountain siblings changed drastically.</p><p>As for Hua Jie, he laughed coldly and thought, ” “Brat, it’s really a good thing for you to die like this.”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. As he looked at the incoming sword light, a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t take out a weapon. Instead, he waved his hand. A red light flashed in his hand, and a red spear formed.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The red Spear’s radiance flashed.</p><p>Fast, too fast, so fast that most people didn’t even see it clearly.</p><p>Only the few elders on the clouds had a change in expression.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the fighting ring, two beams of light collided.</p><p>However, Chen Xiong’s sword radiance was like a layer of bubbles, shattering upon contact. Then, the spear radiance continued and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>The spear quickly disappeared, and two figures stood opposite each other on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Who won?”</p><p>Everyone watched with wide eyes.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Suddenly, a stream of blood spurted out of Chen Xiong’s throat.</p><p>Chen Xiong let out a blood-curdling screech. He clutched his throat tightly with both hands. His eyes were wide open like a dead fish as he stared at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, your lousy battle record is really embarrassing.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Chen Xiong’s eyes revealed a look of fear and unwillingness. Then, he fell down and stopped breathing.</p><p>The surrounding students of the general Star Hall were all dumbfounded.</p><p>One move. He had actually killed a top-tier genius, Chen Xiong, in one move.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not even use a weapon. He had only condensed a long spear with essential Qi, and with a casual attack, he had killed Chen Xiong.</p><p>What kind of strength was this? Wasn’t he too strong?</p><p>In front of him, Chen Xiong simply did not have the slightest strength to fight back.</p><p>genius! Peerless genius!</p><p>Many people were roaring in their hearts.</p><p>he’s so strong. This young man isn’t simple!</p><p>An old man in the clouds said.</p><p>“Could it be a genius from the five great sects?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. I really hope he’s not a disciple of the five great sects.”</p><p>“Investigate, investigate thoroughly. If he’s not from the five great sects, we must do our best to rope him in.”</p><p>The few elders looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, Hua Jie was dumbfounded by the scene. After a long while, he finally reacted and roared angrily, ” “Tianyun, you actually killed Chen Xiong! You actually killed him! You’re going to pay with your life!”</p><p>“Pay with my life? It’s ridiculous, just now it was Chen Xiong himself who shouted that he wanted to kill me. Now that I’ve killed him, it’s completely his own fault. Moreover, elder didn’t say that I can’t kill anyone.”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Hua Jie and said disdainfully.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
