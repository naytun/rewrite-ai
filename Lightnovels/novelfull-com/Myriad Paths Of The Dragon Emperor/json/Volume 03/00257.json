He then moved and headed down setting sun Peak.</p><p>He had not come to see the outcome of the battle between the six heroes, but to see their strength.</p><p>Now, he had a rough idea of the strength of the six heroes of the scorching sun, so there was no need to continue watching.</p><p>He didn’t care who won or lost among the six heroes of the scorching sun.</p><p>Lu Ming moved like a gust of wind and returned to the dormitory very quickly.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the bed and closed his eyes. The scene of the battle between the six heroes of the scorching sun appeared in his mind.</p><p>He already had a rough idea of the strength of the six heroes.</p><p>Feng Wuji, Ling Yanchi, Guan Hong, Qiu changlie, and the others were all at the peak of the 3rd level of the martial ancestor realm. However, their combat strength was extremely terrifying. They were at least at the 5th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>One had to know that he was a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>The higher one’s martial arts realm was, the harder it was to fight across realms.</p><p>In the martial arts Grandmaster realm, to be able to fight across one level was already considered a peerless genius, let alone two levels.</p><p>As for Guan Hong and Qiu changlie, the only reason they were able to win was because they were stronger in both momentum and martial arts.</p><p>the scorching sun’s six heroes indeed live up to their names. They’re only in their twenties, but many grandmasters of the older generation are no match for them.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly thought.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not dejected. Instead, there was a burning flame in his eyes.</p><p>Although the six heroes of the scorching sun were strong, he was confident that he would catch up to them and even surpass them in no time.</p><p>After some thought, Lu Ming left the general Star Hall and went to the treasure Pavilion again. He spent the last 400000 spiritual crystals on 100 Class 9 Lv 3 demonic cores.</p><p>After buying the demonic pill, Lu Ming headed straight into the divine Wind Valley.</p><p>The tough training continued.</p><p>Every day, Lu Ming had gained something. Be it his cultivation, martial arts techniques, or controlling force, he had improved.</p><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, another month had passed. Lu Ming had refined all one hundred demonic cores. He finally walked out of the Holy Wind Valley.</p><p>He returned to the dormitory but did not walk in. Instead, he walked towards Ming Feng’s dormitory.</p><p>He wanted to find Ming Feng to inquire about the situation in the imperial capital in the past month.</p><p>He had a premonition, a premonition that the imperial capital would not be peaceful this month. There would definitely be many things happening.</p><p>When he arrived at Ming Feng’s dormitory, he realized that Ming Feng was not there.</p><p>“Could it be at Ming city?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He walked toward Ming city’s dormitory.</p><p>Now, Ming city had long replaced the position of the top ten Masters of the Baichi outer hall. They lived in a courtyard.</p><p>When he arrived at Ming Cheng’s dormitory, he found Ming Feng and Ming Zhu there. They were sitting on the stone bench in the courtyard and chatting.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, you’ve come out of your seclusion?”</p><p>Ming Feng said with a smile when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, others say that I’m a martial arts fanatic, but I think that you’re the real one. How can you still cultivate in seclusion at this time?”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>“Oh? Why can’t I go into seclusion in peace? Has something major happened in the imperial capital during this period of time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>“Of course. During this period of time, the Imperial City has been in a state of turmoil.”</p><p>Ming Cheng said, ” a month ago, the scorching sun’s six heroes fought. Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi were defeated, while Shangguan Yi and Zuo Lian fought for a thousand moves, but neither of them won. However, this matter did not stop there. A few days later, the gold-rank disciples of the various sects fought again. It was extremely intense, but the ten direction Sword School was extremely powerful. In the battle between the gold-rank disciples, the ten direction Sword School had the upper hand.</p><p>about ten days ago, the omnipresent Sword School sent a ninth grade great Martial Master to challenge the mystical sword School, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and the general Star Hall. The general Star Hall was the first to suffer a crushing defeat. The strongest group of people in the inner hall were defeated by a disciple of the omnipresent Sword School.</p><p>after that, the Crimson Cloud Valley and the mystical sword sect also suffered a crushing defeat. The disciples sent by the omnipresent sword sect were too strong. They were invincible in the realm of the great Martial Master. The disciples on the silver ranking of the mystical sword sect were almost completely defeated.</p><p>Ming Cheng roughly explained the matter.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised. Many things had happened in the imperial capital in the past month.</p><p>in the past month, the ten direction sword sect’s reputation has been at its peak, while the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley’s reputation has declined sharply. The royal family has been suppressed even more. It is said that the mystical sword sect has already mobilized the geniuses with special bloodlines from the Qilin yard to compete with the geniuses from the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>big brother, one of the ninth grade Grandmaster realm geniuses from the omnidirectional Sword School has a special bloodline. If the mystical sword School or the Crimson Cloud Valley’s geniuses with special bloodlines arrive, we might be able to fight them.</p><p>Mingzhu’s eyes sparkled as she spoke.</p><p>it’s hard to say. I heard that some of the strongest great martial masters in the ten direction Sword School haven’t even made a move yet.</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Ming Cheng and Ming Feng were tongue-tied.</p><p>“Ming Cheng, brother Ming Cheng, something big has happened.”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man rushed in.</p><p>“Che Yuan, what happened?”</p><p>Ming Cheng asked the young man.</p><p>I heard that the geniuses with special bloodlines from the mystical sword sect have arrived, and the disciples from the ten directions sword sect have already come to challenge them.</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“What? That’s fast. Let’s go and take a look.”</p><p>Ming Cheng called out. He then looked at Lu Ming.”Brother tianyun, do you want to come along?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he nodded. Together with Ming Cheng and the rest, they rushed towards the mystical sword sect’s residence in the Imperial City.</p><p>When they arrived, they noticed that the entrance of the mystical sword sect’s mansion was already surrounded by people.</p><p>At the very front, there were more than ten disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>A disciple from the ten directions sword sect stood at the entrance of the mystical sword sect’s residence and shouted arrogantly, ” mystical sword sect trash, get the hell out here. What special bloodline genius? I’m guessing they’re just a bunch of trash.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions sword sect laughed out loud. They were filled with contempt.</p><p>The few men guarding the gate of the mystical sword sect were ashen-faced.</p><p>trash from the mystical sword sect, get out here! Are you trying to be a coward? ”</p><p>The young man at the front continued to call out.</p><p>“Tianyun, this young man’s name is Wu kui. He’s extremely powerful, and he’s been able to defeat almost all the Grandmaster martial artists of the mystical sword sect by himself.”</p><p>Ming Cheng whispered to Lu Ming.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>At this moment, the gate of the mystical sword sect’s residence opened, and a few young men and women walked out.</p><p>There were a total of four people, three men and one woman. All of them had threatening auras, and one could tell at a glance that they were Dragons among men.</p><p>Hmph, Wu kui, don’t think that you’re invincible just because you defeated the trash from the four great halls. It’s your biggest mistake to compare us with them.</p><p>A young man carrying a battle axe walked out and said in a cold and arrogant manner.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but purse his lips. The people of Qilin Hall were all the same. No matter how strong or weak their cultivation was, they all had a high and mighty appearance.</p><p>Of course, Qiu Yue was an exception, Lu Ming added in his heart.</p><p>hehe, there are different levels of special bloodlines. Some special bloodlines are trash. In my opinion, you guys are no different from those trash.</p><p>Wu kui laughed in disdain.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man from the mystical sword sect who was carrying a battle-axe on his back roared in anger. Genuine Qi gushed out, and the battle-axe on his back flew out automatically into the young man’s hand.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
