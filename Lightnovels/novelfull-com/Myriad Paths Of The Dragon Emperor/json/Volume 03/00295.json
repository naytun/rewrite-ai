He had shaved off his beard and combed his hair neatly. His sword-like brows extended to his temples, making him look extraordinarily handsome.</p><p>When Lu Yuntian was young, he was already a rarely seen handsome man. However, there was a hideous scar on the top of his nose that extended all the way to his lips, ruining his beauty.</p><p>However, Lu Yuntian did not mind at all. He only stared at Lu Ming in a daze and sized him up carefully.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’ve finally grown up. You’ve even become a genius whose name shakes the world. As expected of my son, hahaha!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Yuntian laughed out loud. He was very satisfied.</p><p>During this period of time, Hua Chi had already told him everything about Lu Ming.</p><p>He was extremely excited and gratified to hear that Lu Ming had achieved so much.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s nose was sour. His eyes were filled with tears as he said in a trembling voice,”Father, who is it? Who did this? I will make him pay ten times the price!”</p><p>He had already checked Lu Yuntian’s body in detail earlier.</p><p>Other than a scar on his face, Lu Yuntian’s internal injuries were even more severe.</p><p>All the meridians in his body were broken, and not a single part was intact.</p><p>In such a situation, let alone cultivation, he was not even as strong as an ordinary person.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of suffering Lu Yuntian had gone through all these years. Lu Ming felt a terrifying killing intent about to burst out of his chest.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, I’ll say the same thing again. Don’t be rash. Before you have absolute strength, you can’t act on impulse.” Lu Yuntian muttered to himself.</p><p>“Father, don’t worry. Ming ‘er knows!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, but his fists were clenched tightly.</p><p>“Fine, father will tell you. All of this was done by Qiu changkong.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian sighed.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, it’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and then said,”why?” Father, why did Qiu changkong do this to you?”</p><p>because of the Martial Emperor’s treasure!</p><p>Lu Yuntian said, ” back then, Qiu changkong wasn’t the current leader of the six heroes of the scorching sun, but he was already a young genius. For some reason, he found out that I had the Martial Emperor’s treasure, so he secretly sent people to capture me. He has been interrogating me all these years, trying to get the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure from me. Haha, he’s dreaming. How could I tell him? It’s just a waste of effort.”</p><p>“Qiu changkong, I’ll make sure he pays a terrible price for this.”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice, his voice extremely cold.”The Martial Emperor’s treasure? Why is he so sure that father knows about the Martial Emperor’s treasure?”</p><p>I do know about the Martial Emperor’s treasure!</p><p>Lu Yuntian chuckled.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>haha, I got the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure by accident. But I was prepared for it, so I’ve already left the news to you.</p><p>Lu Yuntian smiled.</p><p>“You’re leaving it for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>“Could it be that bronze pendant?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian smiled. I obtained that bronze pendant by chance. I found it interesting, so I’ve been carrying it with me. I’ll leave it to you later. The news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure is actually in that Heavenly Star sword.</p><p>“Heavenly Star sword?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Then, he moved his hand and the star sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Yuntian was overjoyed. He took the Heavenly Star sword and examined it carefully before passing it to Lu Ming. Ming ‘er, that’s right. I’ve sealed the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure in this Heavenly Star sword. In this Heavenly Star sword, there’s a key to opening the Martial Emperor’s treasure, as well as a map. You can find an inscription master to retrieve them later on. When your cultivation reaches a certain level, you can head to the Martial Emperor’s treasure and obtain a great opportunity.</p><p>“It’s actually in the Heavenly Star sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, how has your mother been all these years?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian asked. However, his voice was trembling.</p><p>“Father, mother is very good. It’s just that all these years, I’ve been thinking about you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s good. I’ve let her down all these years.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian sighed.</p><p>“Father, don’t worry. The imperial family has already secretly sent people to pick up mother. Our family will be reunited soon.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s eyes revealed a hint of anticipation.</p><p>father, don’t worry. Even if I have to travel all over the world, I will find the spiritual medicine to heal your injuries and let you embark on the path of martial arts again.</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, it’s good that you have this intention. However, it’s easier said than done to cure my injuries. There’s no need to force yourself!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian sighed.</p><p>It had been many years since he had been injured, and all his meridians had been severed. It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to heal him.</p><p>He did not have much hope for himself. He was already satisfied to be able to see Lu Ming and Li Ping in his lifetime.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely determined.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was vast and boundless. There would be no lack of treasures.</p><p>Legend had it that some treasures could even regrow broken limbs or bring the dead back to life.</p><p>As long as he could obtain that treasure, it would not be a small matter to cure Lu Yuntian’s meridians and remove the scars on his face.</p><p>“No matter how hard it is, I must get it.”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly swore.</p><p>After that, he had a long chat with Lu Yuntian.</p><p>After chatting for a few hours, Lu Ming left the place.</p><p>Regardless of whether he wanted to avenge Lu Yuntian or treat his injuries, he could not do without a powerful cultivation base. He had to cultivate non-stop.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, you and I will not rest until one of us is dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>After returning to his room, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and walked away, thinking carefully about the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>Currently, he had a few main cultivation directions.</p><p>One of them was the breakthrough of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>He had obtained the Dragon Bone Pearl from Xie nianqing. As long as he obtained a supplementary material called the cold spirit fluid, he would be able to break through to the fifth stage of the true war Dragon technique and possess six times the strength of ordinary true Qi.</p><p>The other was the cultivation of the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>As long as he could cultivate his body to the fourth stage, he could start to practice the divine level martial technique, Nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and buy a portion of the cold spirit fluid first.”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked towards the Imperial City’s market.</p><p>The cold spirit fluid was only a supplementary material. It was not particularly rare. After circling the market once, Lu Ming successfully bought a portion.</p><p>After returning to the general stars Hall and entering the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming took out the wyrmdragon Bone Pearl and the cold spiritual liquid and began to cultivate.</p><p>First, he refined the Water Dragon Bone bead, and then mixed it with the cold spirit liquid.</p><p>Half a day later, the true war Dragon technique had successfully broken through and reached the fifth stage.</p><p>The surging true Qi circulated in his meridians, vast and endless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>if I cultivate the true war Dragon technique to the ninth stage, I’ll have ten times the amount of true Qi. I wonder how powerful I’ll be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation. He hoped that he could cultivate the true war Dragon technique to the ninth level as soon as possible.</p><p>With ten times the amount of essential Qi, Lu Ming would be unrivaled among those of the same level, unless the other party also cultivated a divine level technique.</p><p>“Now, let’s count!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He then waved his hand and a pile of storage rings appeared on the ground.</p><p>They were all obtained from killing enemies during this period of time.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
