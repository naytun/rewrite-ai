I’ll do my best. I’ll find your father’s whereabouts soon!” He said. Hua Zhengxing said with a serious face.</p><p>“Lu Ming thanks Your Majesty in advance!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed. This time, he was sincere.</p><p>Although he knew that the reason why Hua Zhengxing was helping him was because he saw his talent and wanted to rope him in, it did not matter. As long as it was beneficial to both sides, it was fine.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing smiled, looking quite satisfied. He then took out a gold-stamped invitation and said, ” “Lu Ming, it’ll be my 60th birthday in three months. This is the invitation. You must attend it.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not reject the invitation. He took it and said,”Don’t worry, Your Majesty. Lu Ming will definitely be there.”</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, there aren’t many people who can make my father personally send out an invitation. Only the five great sects and the nobles and ministers of the imperial capital.”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you should focus on your cultivation during this period of time. When the five major sects gather in the Imperial City, the geniuses on the silver ranking and even the gold ranking disciples of each sect will come. I’m afraid that the silver ranking disciples of the omnidirectional Sword School will cause you trouble. You have to be careful.”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing warned seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his gratitude once again. After chatting for a while longer, Lu Ming and Hua Chi stood up and left.</p><p>In the general stars Hall, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on his bed.</p><p>“Father, how have you been all these years? Is it because of that bronze pendant that the ten direction Sword School imprisoned you?”</p><p>“Father, I’m useless. I can’t save you now.”</p><p>Lu Ming clasped his hands tightly together.</p><p>Strength, he was still too weak.</p><p>If he was really strong enough now, he could directly kill his way to the ten direction Sword School and force them to release him.</p><p>But now, he was still far from that. He urgently needed to improve his strength.</p><p>martial arts Grandmaster. I have to reach the martial arts Grandmaster realm as soon as possible. Only a martial arts Grandmaster can be considered a true expert in the blazing sun Empire. Only then can I have the right to speak. Furthermore, I can fly. It will be of great help to me when I do things.</p><p>after the series of battles at the Emperor heaven battle arena, I feel that my bottleneck has loosened. I’ll go and buy another batch of demonic cores tomorrow to raise my cultivation level with all my might.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming appeared on the third platform of the Supreme shrine. He placed the spiritual crystal in and began to fight with ‘himself’.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming went out early and headed to the market.</p><p>It was still the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>“Young master, you’re here. Please come in.”</p><p>The eyes of the young lady who had received Lu Ming previously lit up the moment she saw him. She brought Lu Ming to a vip room.</p><p>“Hahaha, young master, long time no see.”</p><p>Very quickly, the shopkeeper walked in.</p><p>“Young master, what do you need to buy this time?”</p><p>“Shopkeeper, I’d like 100 Class 9 Lv 3 demonic cores.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“One … A hundred?”</p><p>The shopkeeper was shocked.</p><p>yes, is there a problem? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>Could it be that the treasure Pavilion didn’t have that much stock?</p><p>“No, no problem!”</p><p>The shopkeeper quickly shook his head. He was just shocked earlier and did not understand why Lu Ming bought so many demonic cores.</p><p>also, 20 portions of blood essence of Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>Alright, alright. Please wait a moment, young master. I’ll be right there.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded his head repeatedly, his face full of smiles, and walked out.</p><p>Soon, the shopkeeper brought over 100 demonic cores and 20 demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>young master, the original price of these blood essence and monster cores was one million spiritual crystals. But you have a VIP card with a 20% discount. The total price is 800000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>The shopkeeper said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was good to have a VIP card. He could save two hundred thousand spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming paid the spirit crystals without hesitation and kept the blood essence and demonic core. He then left the treasure Pavilion under the respectful gazes of the shopkeeper and the beautiful saleswomen.</p><p>After returning to the general stars Hall, Lu Ming walked straight to the earth Aeon cave.</p><p>The effect was the best when it was combined with the cultivation in the earth cave.</p><p>On the sixth level of the earth cave, Lu Ming walked into a secret room and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>With a flash of Crimson light, the spirit-devouring bloodline emerged.</p><p>The Python, which was more than ten meters long and had distinct scales, was suspended above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a demonic pill. The giant python opened its mouth and sucked the demonic pill into its mouth. At the same time, it also sucked in a huge amount of fire-element spiritual energy.</p><p>Now that his spirit-devouring bloodline had reached the seventh level, it could devour the spiritual energy of heaven and earth at a terrifying speed, even faster than a ninth level bloodline.</p><p>The massive amount of fire-type spiritual energy and the energy from the demonic core were refined by his blood and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The bottleneck at the peak of the sixth grade great master realm had finally loosened, and there were signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>“Two more!”</p><p>With a move of his hand, he took out two more demon cores and let the giant python swallow them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Waves of energy continuously surged into Lu Ming’s body and finally turned into a loud boom. He had broken through to the seventh grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>After breaking through to the seventh grade Grandmaster realm, Lu Ming’s bloodline had become even more terrifying. It was constantly absorbing the spirit Qi from the outside world. The spirit Qi from the outside world formed a funnel that was constantly devoured by the spirit-devouring bloodline.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took out another demonic core and continued to devour it.</p><p>The essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body surged crazily.</p><p>A few hours later, the strange phenomenon finally disappeared.</p><p>a seventh grade Grandmaster’s true Qi is twice as dense as a sixth grade Grandmaster’s, but it’s still not enough. I need to continue breaking through!</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to consume demonic cores and cultivate.</p><p>Every day, he would spend half of his time cultivating the true war Dragon technique, swallowing demonic cores to increase his cultivation, and the rest of his time comprehending the force of fire and comprehending martial arts techniques.</p><p>Time flew by, and a month’s time passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming had devoured all one hundred demonic cores, and his cultivation had risen to the peak seventh grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>That’s right, a hundred ninth grade third level demonic cores could only raise Lu Ming’s cultivation to the peak of the seventh grade great master.</p><p>At the seventh grade great master realm and ninth grade third level demonic cores, the effects were much weaker.</p><p>He had also consumed all 20 portions of Class 9 Lv 3 demonic beast blood essence to improve his bloodline level. However, his bloodline was still at Level 7 and had not broken through.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that unless it was the blood essence of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, the level of the blood Meridian would increase very slowly.</p><p>The blood essence of a Wu Zong!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming could not help smiling bitterly.</p><p>The blood essence of a martial arts Grandmaster was equivalent to the blood essence of a level-four demonic beast. The thought of its price gave Lu Ming a headache.</p><p>the sixth level of the earth cave. The fire-property spiritual Qi is still a little weak. Let’s go to the seventh level!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>It was said that only martial grandmasters could go to the seventh level of the earth cave. Because the fire-property spiritual Qi was too rich and violent, it was very dangerous for a martial Grandmaster to go down.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the spirit-devouring bloodline and was not afraid at all. He intended to make use of the rich and violent spiritual energy of heaven and earth to help him break through to the next realm and comprehend the force of fire at the same time.</p><p>He felt that the force of fire was already very close to large success.</p><p>He walked out of the secret room and headed to the seventh floor.</p><p>As soon as he reached the seventh level, Lu Ming felt as if he had arrived at the mouth of a volcano. The terrifying and violent fire-attribute spiritual Qi continuously charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good, this is the kind of environment I need.”</p><p>He opened a secret chamber and walked in. Then, he controlled his spirit-devouring bloodline. The violent spiritual energy of heaven and earth continuously gathered toward Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
