Someone told bai chi to come out.”</p><p>“Who is this person? Why are you so arrogant?”</p><p>“Don’t tell me he’s one of the top ten Warriors of the outer Palace? bai chi is ranked tenth in the top ten, only the other top ten Warriors would dare to call him that.”</p><p>“There’s something interesting to see, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Suddenly, from the dormitory’s Pavilion, figures flickered and headed towards bai Chi’s courtyard. Soon, a circle of people appeared outside bai Chi’s courtyard, and the number of people was still increasing.</p><p>“Where did this blind dog come from? are you looking for death?”</p><p>A loud roar came from Baichi’s courtyard.</p><p>Then, the gate of the courtyard opened and four or five figures walked out.</p><p>The one leading them was bai chi, and Bai Long was at his side.</p><p>It had been a month, but Bai Long’s arm had not recovered yet, and it was still wrapped in thick bandages.</p><p>At this moment, Bai Long’s gaze swept across the surroundings. It was obvious that he was the one who had let out the roar.</p><p>Then, his eyes fell on Ming Feng.</p><p>“Little bastard, it’s you. Why? The lesson last time wasn’t enough, and now you’re looking for death. Since that’s the case, I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p><p>Bai Long laughed savagely.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>“Slap his mouth!”</p><p>Suddenly, Ming Cheng’s body moved. In a flash, he appeared in front of Bai Long and swung his palm.</p><p>They were so fast that even Baichi could not save them in time.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Bai Long was sent flying by a slap.</p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent.</p><p>“Isn’t that the martial arts fanatic from Ming city? How dare you slap Bai Long in front of bai chi?”</p><p>yeah, Ming Cheng is a martial arts fanatic. He cultivated into a demon before. I didn’t expect him to be so bold.</p><p>“Baichi is going to lose his temper. I wonder if Ming city can deal with him?”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with the sound of discussion.</p><p>Ming city, right? do you know the consequences of this? ”</p><p>Bai Chi’s face was extremely gloomy as he looked at Ming Cheng coldly.</p><p>“Why didn’t you think about the consequences of hurting my brother? Now, I’m giving him a slap, which is considered light. Now it’s your turn. Let me see what tricks you, one of the top ten Masters, have up your sleeve.”</p><p>Ming Cheng stared at bai chi, his eyes flashing with a crazy desire to fight.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>The aura of a peak sixth grade great master.</p><p>Bai Chi’s pupils slightly shrank, and then he sneered, ” so, you’re a peak sixth grade great Martial Master. No wonder you dared to cause trouble in front of my door. But today, I’ll tell you that even though we’re both peak sixth grade great martial masters, there’s a huge difference in our combat strength. You’ll regret what you’ve done today.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura also burst out from Baichi’s body. It was also the aura of a peak sixth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>The two auras collided, stirring up a gust of wind.</p><p>“Haha, then let’s fight!”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed maniacally. He unsheathed his saber with a terrifying saber radiance.</p><p>The blade light turned black and rose into the sky, stirring the wind and clouds.</p><p>“Eight desolations war blade!”</p><p>die! Ming Cheng roared and slashed out with his saber. A terrifying saber radiance slashed towards bai chi.</p><p>As soon as the saber was used, a terrifying saber intent filled the entire area, and everyone felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>so strong! He’s too strong!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Baichi’s pupils suddenly contracted and he shouted, ” “White Snake dragon palm!”</p><p>He struck out with his palm and the space trembled. A huge white Snake formed and hissed towards the sky, charging towards Ming Cheng’s blade light.</p><p>An earth-shaking sound was heard and bai Chi’s body was shaken and he was pushed back.</p><p>Ming city, on the other hand, did not move.</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded.</p><p>this martial arts fanatic Ming Cheng is actually so strong. Even bai chi was forced to retreat in one move!</p><p>it seems that we have underestimated Ming city. Some people just don’t like reputation, but they are not necessarily weak. Now it seems that the top ten experts of the outer Palace are not necessarily the strongest.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Of course, there were also people who opposed it.</p><p>Baichi was just careless just now. He might not lose. It’s too early to say this!</p><p>Someone retorted.</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion, but bai Chi’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Baichi, so this is all you’ve got. It’s really disappointing. From now on, you can give me your title as one of the top ten Warriors of the outer Palace!”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>the battle has just begun. It’s too early for you to be happy. You’re not qualified to defeat me!</p><p>“Dragon White Snake palm, Dragon Transformation!”</p><p>Baichi let out a long roar and his genuine Qi surged. His hands were filled with a thick white light. He struck out with his palm and a huge white Snake appeared. Once it appeared, it changed rapidly and finally turned into a white giant dragon, pouncing towards Ming city.</p><p>Dragon! He really turned into a Dragon!</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled when they saw this.</p><p>Baichi’s battle power was truly shocking.</p><p>Even a seventh grade great Martial Master wouldn’t be able to withstand such a combat strength, let alone a peak sixth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>“I’ll defeat you in 30 moves with just a small trick!”</p><p>Ming Cheng sneered. He held the saber with both hands and slowly raised it.</p><p>At this moment, a huge blade was formed. The huge blade was dark, like the scythe of the death god, and it slowly slashed towards bai chi.</p><p>The huge blade and the White Dragon clashed.</p><p>The White Dragon let out a long roar, opened its mouth, and bit down on the huge blade.</p><p>However, the giant saber shook violently, and the terrifying saber radiance shook the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the White Dragon was defeated, turning into a wave of energy and dissipating.</p><p>The giant blade did not stop.</p><p>White Snake dragon palm, one palm turning into ten Dragons!</p><p>Baichi roared and clapped his hands.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At that moment, ten white giant Dragons appeared and roared as they charged toward Ming city.</p><p>“Eight desolations war saber, fight! Battle! Battle!”</p><p>Ming Cheng’s fighting spirit was shocking. He slashed wildly with his saber, showing the overbearing and powerful strength of a swordsman.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, Liu Mazi, and the rest had just arrived.</p><p>“Someone is fighting against Baichi. Who is it? It’s actually so powerful?”</p><p>Liu Mazi gasped.</p><p>that’s Ming Cheng, the martial madman Ming Cheng. I didn’t expect him to be so powerful. It’s amazing. Fortunately, I didn’t offend him before!</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>“Ming city? His surname is Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He swept his gaze and indeed, he saw Mingzhu and Mingfeng.</p><p>“I wonder what is the relationship between Ming city and pearl mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought.</p><p>At the same time, he walked forward and essential Qi gushed out of his body. The people in front of him made way for him subconsciously. Lu Ming walked forward and stood in the crowd to watch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbles continued. Ming Cheng and bai chi had exchanged more than a dozen moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, Ming Cheng became more and more courageous as the battle progressed, and Baichi gradually lost. “Ah!”</p><p>Bai chi roared in anger, but it was useless. He was completely suppressed by Ming Cheng.</p><p>“Eight desolations war saber, break the heavens and destroy the earth!”</p><p>Ming Cheng made the last strike. This strike contained all of Ming Cheng’s fighting spirit.</p><p>This blade seemed to be able to destroy everything.</p><p>As the saber slashed down, bai chi roared and retreated rapidly. Everyone saw a wound appear on bai Chi’s body, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Baichi’s face was pale.</p><p>He had lost.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
