A terrifying fist force hit the battle-ax.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a loud bang, the young man with the battle-axe retreated slightly.</p><p>“Damn it, explode!”</p><p>The battle-axe young man roared as an ancient battle-axe floated above his head. On the battle-axe, there were six blood-red chakras.</p><p>This was his special bloodline.</p><p>The battleaxe shook and merged with the young man, causing his aura to soar.</p><p>“Sky splitting slash!”</p><p>The young man let out a long howl and struck out with his axe.</p><p>This axe could split mountains and split the sky. It was twice as powerful as the previous one.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, Wu kui’s body flashed with a blood-red light. Then, a vast mountain appeared above his head.</p><p>The mountain was ancient, like the ancient and Wild Devil Mountain.</p><p>Wu kui’s bloodline was like a mountain. Without a doubt, it was a special bloodline.</p><p>it’s amazing. Wu kui’s bloodline is like a mountain. I’ve never seen him use it before.</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing Devil Mountain!”</p><p>die! Wu kui roared and punched out. The terrifying fist force turned into a vast demonic mountain and pressed down on the battle-axe young man.</p><p>“Split it open!”</p><p>The young man with the battle-ax shouted as his battle-ax chopped down on the mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent tremor, the mountain was not split open. Instead, the young man with the battle-axe trembled violently. His body was pressed down by the heavy mountain and smashed onto the ground.</p><p>With a blood-curdling screech, the young man with the battle-ax was crushed into a meat paste by the mountain.</p><p>A genius with a special bloodline was killed just like that.</p><p>Hmph, a special bloodline contains ancient secrets. Only by comprehending mysterious secret skills and divine abilities from it can the power of the special bloodline be fully exerted.</p><p>what’s the use of a trash who can only use his unique bloodline to comprehend force and cultivate martial techniques in this world?!</p><p>Wu kui’s mocking voice was heard.</p><p>The remaining young men from the mystical sword sect had extremely unsightly expressions.</p><p>“Now, who’s going to go up?”</p><p>Wu kui looked at the remaining people.</p><p>At the martial Grandmaster realm, the duration of the bloodline explosion had been increased to an astonishing ten minutes, and he could already last for a long time in battle.</p><p>The remaining people from the mystical sword sect looked at each other with grave expressions.</p><p>For a moment, no one appeared.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to fight? you’re a bunch of trash. Is this the strength of the mystical sword sect? What a disappointment. Let me tell you, there are five people stronger than me in the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>Wu kui sneered.</p><p>“What? There were five more? It’s impossible!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Wu kui’s words shocked everyone.</p><p>Initially, everyone thought that with Wu kui’s strength, he would definitely be one of the top few in the ten directions sword sect. He might even be the strongest person in the ten directions sword sect at the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>However, Wu kui actually said that there were five people from the ten direction Sword School who were stronger than him. How was this possible?</p><p>If it was true, it was too terrifying, right?</p><p>“Hehe, your mystical sword sect can’t even defeat me, the sixth-ranked sect. In my opinion, you should just withdraw from the five major sects.”</p><p>Wu kui continued to mock.</p><p>“Dammit, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A young man with a sword on his back walked out of the three remaining people from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>There was nothing much to say. A huge battle immediately broke out. Unfortunately, Wu kui was too powerful. The bloodline of the young man carrying a combat sword was an ancient combat sword. He was even stronger than the young man with the battle-ax, but he was still no match for Wu kui.</p><p>After more than 30 moves, the young man with a sword on his back was forced to cough up blood by Wu kui’s Mountain. If he was not strong enough, he would have been crushed into a pulp.</p><p>The mystical sword sect had lost another person.</p><p>“Hahaha, who else is there? Hurry up and come up for a fight!”</p><p>Wu kui laughed arrogantly.</p><p>The remaining two people from the mystical sword sect had extremely unsightly expressions.</p><p>They were not as powerful as the young man with the sword. If they went up, they would only be humiliating themselves and might even lose their lives.</p><p>However, they were already the strongest among the great martial masters in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Who else is coming up? Don’t they even dare to fight? What a bunch of trash.”</p><p>Wu kui laughed.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming looked on coldly. He had no intention of making a move.</p><p>What did the loss of the mystical sword sect have to do with him? He had no interest in making a move.</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi and a few golden-robed elders stood among the clouds. They looked down with gloomy faces.</p><p>I didn’t expect the ten direction Sword School to secretly cultivate so many peerless geniuses over the years. Wu kui has already comprehended some secret skills from his bloodline. Ordinary special bloodlines are no match for him at all.</p><p>A gold-robed elder sighed.</p><p>it’s a pity that Duanmu Lin has broken through to the martial ancestor realm. If he was still in the martial Grandmaster realm, he would definitely be able to defeat him.</p><p>Another golden-robed elder said.</p><p>After that, they all fell silent. Now that their defeat was set in stone, what they had to think about was how to reduce the impact as much as possible.</p><p>Junior Brother Wu kui, it seems like they don’t have the guts to fight anymore. Sigh, how disappointing. I thought I’d have a decent opponent today!</p><p>Another disciple from the ten directions Sword School sighed.</p><p>“The mystical sword sect better withdraw from the ranks of the five great sects as soon as possible, so as not to embarrass yourself. Haha.”</p><p>Wu kui laughed.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming smiled and shook his head. He was about to walk out.</p><p>“Tianyun, is that you? Stop right there!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar suddenly rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He stopped in his tracks and turned around.</p><p>A disciple from the omnipresent sword sect glared at Lu Ming with a sinister expression, gritting his teeth.</p><p>It was obvious that this disciple from the ten directions Sword School had seen him before and recognized him.</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, the others were shocked and could not help but step back. Only the three Ming siblings were left around Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’s tianyun?”</p><p>Wu kui’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>yes, this person is tianyun. He has repeatedly opposed our ten directions sword sect. He deserves to die ten thousand times.</p><p>The young man who had recognized Lu Ming said with a murderous intent.</p><p>during this period of time, other senior brothers went to look for him, but he was like a turtle hiding in its shell. Today, I finally saw him.</p><p>The young man added.</p><p>“Hide?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He was only cultivating in seclusion. When did he hide?</p><p>“That’s good, then I’ll settle it conveniently!”</p><p>Wu kui smiled coldly and walked toward Lu Ming. He glared at Lu Ming and said,”You’re tianyun? You should know that the crime you’ve committed is unforgivable. How about this, I’ll give you a chance to kill yourself. This way, I can make the decision and leave your corpse intact.”</p><p>Wu kui put his hands behind his back and put on an arrogant expression.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. This brother felt too good about himself. He wanted him to commit suicide?</p><p>is your brain broken? or did your mother’s father accidentally flatten your head? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Wu kui and said word by word.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>As soon as he said that, the surrounding people couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
