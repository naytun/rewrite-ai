I suggest that we establish a burning sun Alliance. All the sects and powers of the burning sun Empire must join this Alliance. We will elect a leader and then swear to follow the leader’s orders!</p><p>only in this way can the burning sun Empire grow stronger and stronger, resist the foreign enemies, and become stronger and stronger!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang shouted.</p><p>hahaha, Qiu Wuyang, you’ve finally revealed your purpose. You want to be the leader of the Alliance and rule the world, right? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi laughed.</p><p>“Lin Xueyi, what are you laughing at? I think that sect master Qiu’s suggestion is very good. Besides, in the current blazing sun Empire, who else is qualified to take on the position of Alliance leader other than sect master Qiu?”</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen stood up and shouted.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen, you are wrong. In the blazing sun Empire, the royal family is the legitimate family. Why go through so much trouble and create the sun Alliance? we can just follow His Majesty’s orders.</p><p>The valley master retorted.</p><p>“In the world of martial Dao, the strong are respected. Forgive me for being blunt, but Your Majesty, he doesn’t have the right!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang said coldly.</p><p>Giggle!</p><p>Hua Zhengxing clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Insult, this was a blatant insult.</p><p>This was equivalent to slapping the emperor’s face in public.</p><p>“Hateful, hateful!”</p><p>Hua Chi growled, his entire body trembling from the intense atmosphere.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A white-haired old man slammed the table and stood up. He raised his trembling hand and pointed at Qiu Wuyang. Qiu Wuyang, you’ve disrespected your superiors and insulted His Majesty. You deserve to die!</p><p>“A crime that deserves ten thousand deaths? I think you’re the one who’s going to die.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s eyes glowed, and two rays of sword Qi flashed out of his eyes. It was so fast that there was no warning.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The elder had been pierced by the sword Qi, and two holes appeared on his body. No blood flowed out, but he had no life left.</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing roared.</p><p>This old man was Hua Zhengxing’s teacher, the teacher of the Emperor. However, he was killed by Qiu Wuyang’s gaze.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, you’ve gone too far.”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing glared at Qiu Wuyang in anger.</p><p>However, Qiu Wuyang only smiled as if he had just killed an ant. this old man is trying to ruin our plan. I suspect that he is a spy sent by another Empire to destroy our Empire. Such a person must be killed as soon as possible.</p><p>In just a few words, he had turned the emperor’s teacher into a spy.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing, Hua Chi, and some of the other members of the imperial family were furious. They felt humiliated, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>The power of the ten direction Sword School was too strong.</p><p>Hua Chi clenched his hands so tightly that his nails had dug into his flesh and blood was flowing out, but he did not feel anything.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and patted Hua Chi’s back. A surge of essential Qi flowed into Hua Chi’s body. Only then did Hua Chi slowly calm down. Otherwise, he would have suffered internal injuries from being too excited.</p><p>“What do you all think of my suggestion just now?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang asked as he looked around.</p><p>“I agree with sect master Qiu’s suggestion.”</p><p>The sect leader of heavenly fiend sect smiled faintly.</p><p>The other three sect Masters “expressions changed at Tian Sha sect Master’s words.</p><p>Why would heaven fiend sect agree to this? Could it be that they had already formed an alliance with the ten direction Sword School?</p><p>If that was the case, the situation would be serious.</p><p>The omnipresent sword sect was already extremely powerful, and with the addition of the heavenfiend sect, the balance of power in the blazing sun Empire would be broken.</p><p>“Haha, brother Yue, you really do understand me.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang laughed and looked at the other sects.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, stop dreaming. The mystical sword sect will never agree to this.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi sneered.</p><p>“My Crimson Cloud Valley will not accompany you either.”</p><p>“My ghost moon saber sect is also not interested.”</p><p>The sect Masters of the Scarlet cloud Valley and the ghost moon saber sect also refused.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s face darkened. Then, he looked at Hua Zhengxing and said, ” “Your Majesty, what about you?”</p><p>“Me? Hehe, the blazing sun Empire has been around for more than two thousand years. How can it be ruined by me? please forgive me, I can’t agree to this.”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing said coldly.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing, you have to think carefully. For the sake of your Hua family and the tens of thousands of lives, think carefully.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he said coldly.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, what are you doing? To threaten His Majesty? Do you really think that the ten direction Sword School is invincible?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi was furious and shouted.</p><p>“I don’t know if my ten direction sword sect is invincible, but I can still destroy your mystical sword sect. Do you want to try?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s tone was cold.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to destroy the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi didn’t back down. Her aura surged out and a terrifying sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>There was a terrifying aura in the sword Qi.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, it’s been decades since we last fought. I’d like to see how much you’ve improved.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Qiu Wuyang finished speaking, an extremely strong aura burst out from his body. At the same time, a beam of sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s and Qiu Wuyang’s sword Qi met in the air and collided fiercely.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded, shaking the entire capital. The two sword Qi formed a pillar of light at the point of collision, shooting straight into the sky and smashing the clouds into pieces.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in the imperial capital stared at the pillar of light in shock and horror.</p><p>Even those who were further away from the imperial capital could see the pillar of light.</p><p>Everyone was trying to guess what kind of existences were fighting.</p><p>In the palace, Lu Ming looked on in shock.</p><p>Was this the power of a sect master, the ruler of the burning sun Empire?</p><p>It was indeed extremely terrifying, as deep as the ocean and unfathomable.</p><p>They could kill ordinary martial arts grandmasters with a flick of their fingers.</p><p>In that move just now, the two of them didn’t really fight at all. It was just a clash of auras.</p><p>If they really made a move, the imperial capital would be destroyed.</p><p>force, what a strong force. Both of their forces have definitely reached perfection. In fact, there’s even a hint of ‘intent’ in them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>After force reached perfection, one could use force as a Foundation to comprehend ‘intent’.</p><p>For example, fire intent, wind intent, and so on.</p><p>Will was the true essence of heaven and earth, and it was incomparably powerful.</p><p>Only by comprehending the ‘intent’ could one step into the martial King realm.</p><p>“Lin Xueyi, then today, I will kill you first.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang let out a long howl as his sword Qi soared into the sky, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s long hair fluttered in the wind as she faced Qiu Wuyang without backing down.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, two terrifying auras burst out one after another. They were not any weaker than Lin Xueyi and Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>It was the Scarlet cloud Valley master and the sect master of the ghost moon saber sect.</p><p>Their auras combined with Lin Xueyi’s and pressed down on Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, do you really think that the blazing sun Empire belongs to your ten direction sword sect? Don’t go too far.”</p><p>The valley master said.</p><p>The Crimson Cloud Valley and the mystical sword sect had always been on good terms, so he was naturally on Lin Xueyi’s side.</p><p>The sect master of the ghost moon saber sect didn’t say anything, but his attitude said it all.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
