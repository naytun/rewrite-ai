Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Outside of the crowd, Ming Cheng, Ming Zhu, and Ming Feng returned and flew over at top speed.</p><p>It was obvious that they had heard the commotion and returned.</p><p>“That’s big brother tianyun! Big brother tianyun is too strong! He actually forced bai chi to retreat!”</p><p>Ming Feng shouted in surprise.</p><p>Mingzhu also looked on in surprise.</p><p>Ming Cheng’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“The third move!” A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth again.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The third spear thrust out.</p><p>The tip of the spear glowed with a faint green light. It was agile, ethereal, and extremely sharp.</p><p>The space seemed to have been pierced through, and a blue mark appeared.</p><p>Only traces could be seen, no gun could be seen. It was too fast.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Before bai chi could even react, the tip of Lu Ming’s spear had pierced through his shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>He didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>“Argh! Ah!”</p><p>It was not until Baichi let out a shrill scream that everyone came to their senses.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Immediately, gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>Three moves. It was really three moves. Lu Ming nailed bai chi to the ground.</p><p>Too strong, he was simply too strong.</p><p>Everyone was roaring in their hearts.</p><p>Even an idiot could tell that bai chi had no way of fighting back in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Where did this young man come from? Wasn’t his strength too terrifying?</p><p>Today, they had defeated bai chi in thirty moves in Ming city, to let everyone know that the so-called top ten experts of the outer Palace were not invincible. There were many hidden experts in the outer Palace.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s next move was even more exaggerated. He nailed bai chi to the ground in three moves.</p><p>It made people even more convinced that there were many experts hidden in the outer Palace.</p><p>force, that’s force. He just used the force of wind!</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>There was no lack of experts in the outer hall. Naturally, there were people who recognized the force of the wind that Lu Ming had displayed.</p><p>Lu Ming had indeed cast the force of the wind just now.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the force of the wind and the speed of his spear was extremely fast.</p><p>“What? It was actually the force of the wind? He’s so young, and his cultivation is only at the great Martial Master realm, but he’s already comprehended force. Terrifying!”</p><p>“Genius, a peerless genius. Even in the five great sects, he’s a rare peerless genius.”</p><p>There was a heated discussion in the surroundings. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Wind force was only something he had comprehended some time ago. If everyone knew that he had also comprehended Fire Force, and that it had already reached small success, who knew how shocked they would be.</p><p>force? big brother tianyun has actually comprehended force? ”</p><p>In the crowd, Ming Feng’s mouth was wide open in shock.</p><p>“Second sister, little brother, is he the tianyun you were talking about? He’s indeed a top genius. Haha, I’ll definitely find him to spar with in the future.”</p><p>Ming Cheng grinned, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen? It’s impossible, impossible!”</p><p>Bai Long looked at this scene in a daze. His eyes were filled with disbelief, and he kept muttering to himself as if he couldn’t accept this.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. There are so many geniuses and experts. What can you and your brother do?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>He really didn’t put a genius like bai chi in his eyes.</p><p>He estimated that bai Chi’s level of talent would be about the same as the top ten on the bronze list if he were in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>With his current combat strength, it was not difficult for him to fight a genius of this level who was several levels higher than him.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Baichi roared and struggled with all his might, his eyes showing a humiliated expression.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? I forgot to tell you that I have a strong point, and that is that I like to return everything that others want to do to me. Just now, you threatened to break all the bones in my body, hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>His voice wasn’t loud, but it was cold enough to make people shiver.</p><p>Baichi’s eyes were filled with fear and he shouted, ” “No, don’t …”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm shook and the long spear trembled. A powerful force gushed out of the long spear and rushed into bai Chi’s body.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka …</p><p>The sound of beans being fried came from Baichi’s body.</p><p>Baichi let out a shrill scream. All the bones in his body were crushed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Everyone was shocked, and then a bone-piercing chill spread from their backs.</p><p>Ruthless, he was too ruthless. Lu Ming had actually broken bai Chi’s bones.</p><p>However, a large number of people were very pleased and completely acknowledged Lu Ming.</p><p>This was how martial artists should be.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were calm and he did not look like he could not bear to do it.</p><p>If he were to lose today and fall into bai Chi’s hands, bai chi would definitely break his bones.</p><p>If he wasn’t ruthless, others would be ruthless to him. In this world, the weak were prey to the strong.</p><p>“Big … Big brother …”</p><p>On the side, Bai Long’s body was trembling non-stop. His face was pale and bloodless, and even his voice was trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across him. Bai Long shouted,’no!’ And fell limply to the ground.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Bai Long’s body trembled, and he struggled to his feet, trying to run out.</p><p>“Get back here and take your big brother away.”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Bai Long hurriedly ran back, supported bai chi, and staggered away.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, big brother tianyun, you’re really too amazing. I really admire you.”</p><p>At this moment, Ming Feng shouted and squeezed through the crowd. He ran towards Lu Ming, followed by Mingzhu and Ming Cheng.</p><p>“Ming Feng, it’s all my fault that you were injured by Baichi.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How can you blame big brother tianyun for this? it’s just that my cultivation base is too weak. Besides, didn’t big brother tianyun teach bai chi a harsh lesson today and stand up for me?”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Behind Ming Feng, Ming Cheng coughed a few times.</p><p>“Ah? Of course, my beloved big brother also taught Baichi a lesson and helped me vent my anger. I thank you, big brother!”</p><p>Ming Feng’s eyes turned and he quickly smiled.</p><p>“You bastard!”</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed and scolded him. He then looked at Lu Ming, cupped his fists, and said,”I am Ming Cheng, the Big Brother of Ming Zhu and Ming Feng. I’ve just heard the two of them talk about you. I didn’t expect brother tianyun to be such a peerless genius. I truly admire you.”</p><p>“Brother Ming is too kind, I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“There’s no need for brother tianyun to be so modest. How about this, let’s have a sparring match some other day, how about that?”</p><p>Ming Cheng looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>Ming Zhu and Ming Feng revealed an expression that said “as expected.”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not refuse.</p><p>good, that’s great! Haha!</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>let’s go. It’s fate that we’re able to meet brother tianyun today. Let’s have a good drink. It’s my treat!</p><p>Ming Cheng laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reject her. It was always good to make more friends in the imperial capital.</p><p>The few of them found a restaurant and had a good drink. When they returned, it was already late at night.</p><p>The night passed uneventfully. The next morning, an old man came to Lu Ming’s dormitory.</p><p>“Tianyun, my young master would like to see you.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
