I have to break through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm as soon as possible. Right now, I seem to be invincible among the great martial masters, but it’s still not enough when I encounter a strong martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>“The day I break through to Wu Zong will be the day you die.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Hurry up and rescue the injured and clean up the dormitory.”</p><p>The elder of the general Star Hall instructed his men.</p><p>On the side, Hua Chi’s eyes were filled with intense killing intent and unwillingness.</p><p>He had been attacked in public, destroyed a few buildings, killed more than a dozen students, and injured many more.</p><p>As for the people he had brought, they clearly had the ability to make the other party stay, but they could only watch helplessly as the murderer left.</p><p>This humiliation made Hua Chi’s entire body tremble.</p><p>After a long while, Hua Chi took a deep breath and walked to Lu Ming’s side.”Tianyun, are your injuries alright?”</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although his injuries were not light, they did not hurt his core. It would not take long for him to recover.</p><p>I really didn’t expect that the ten direction Sword School would dare to kill people in the general stars Hall so openly. They’re getting more and more lawless. In the past, they would have some scruples.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“This time, I have to thank you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Why are you thanking me? Lu Ming, I have something to discuss with you today. I didn’t expect to encounter what happened just now.”</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s about your father!” Hua Chi said softly.</p><p>“My father!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. His eyes shone with hope and he said in a trembling voice, ” “Don’t tell me you’re afraid?”</p><p>Hua Chi nodded and said,”let’s talk on the side.” &Nbsp;</p><p>The two of them walked to a place where no one was.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve found out about your father.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Where is my father? Is he in the imperial capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in a trembling voice.</p><p>Hua Chi shook his head. he was originally in the imperial capital. He was imprisoned by the people of the ten directions sword sect in an extremely secretive place in the northern part of the imperial capital. However, seven days ago, a group of unknown people suddenly attacked that secret place. Your father has already been kidnapped by that group of people.</p><p>“What? They were taken away by a group of unknown people?”</p><p>“Do you know why that group of people kidnapped my father?” Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Hua Chi Yao le shook her head,”I don’t know about this!” However, we’ve already found out that those people are rushing to the Forsaken desolation, and the people from the omnipresent sword sect are pursuing them with all their might.”</p><p>lonely wasteland, I’m going to save my father immediately!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed an anxious look.</p><p>“Wait a minute, Lu Ming. Don’t be anxious. Don’t forget that the disciples of the omnipresent Sword School are still waiting for you outside.”</p><p>Hua Chi called out.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath to calm himself down. Yes, he had to deal with the two disciples of the omnipresent Sword School first before he could go to the forsaken land.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll find a way to lure the two disciples of the omnipresent Sword School away. Also, my father has already sent four experts to the forsaken land in secret.”</p><p>At this point, a sword-shaped Jade tablet appeared in Hua Chi’s hand. He handed it to Lu Ming and said, this is a ten-thousand-mile sound-transmitting talisman. The four experts sent by my father also have one. You can use it to send a message to them when you reach the desolate wilderness. You will be able to receive the other party’s information within ten thousand miles.</p><p>“Hua Chi, many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and thanked him sincerely. Hua Chi had really helped him a lot.</p><p>I’ve already said that you don’t need to thank me. Be careful on your way.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and smiled. let’s have a drink and chat when I’m back.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go and draw away the two from the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>Hua Chi nodded and left the general Star Hall with the two elders.</p><p>About half an hour later, Hua Chi’s figure appeared. He said,”Lu Ming, you can leave now.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took out a black robe and put on a bamboo hat. He moved and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming left the general Star Hall and headed north along some side streets.</p><p>After passing through seven or eight streets, he did not find any disciples from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming let his guard down, a delicate voice was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air was heard. A beautiful figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank … Thank you. Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He looked at the person in front of him, dumbfounded.</p><p>The young girl in front of him was extremely pretty. She was wearing a short skirt, revealing a pair of slender, fair, and tender legs. She was staring at Lu Ming with her big eyes.</p><p>Who else could it be but Xie nianqing?</p><p>He had never expected to meet Xie nianqing here.</p><p>Why did Xie nianqing stop him? He had changed his appearance and was wearing a black robe and a bamboo hat, so Xie nianqing would not be able to recognize him.</p><p>“Cough, cough. Young lady, may I know why you are blocking my way?”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times and lowered his voice. He sounded like a burly man in his thirties.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you pretending? I’ve finally found you. Come, let’s have a big fight.”</p><p>The corners of Xie nianqing’s mouth lifted slightly as he said in disdain.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Xie nianqing really recognized him. How was that possible?</p><p>Could he have revealed something? but he looked around and didn’t reveal anything.</p><p>However, why did Xie nianqing insist that he was Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming took off his bamboo hat and revealed his disguised face.”Young lady, look, you’ve really got the wrong person.”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curled up slightly, and his disdain grew. “Lu Ming, stop pretending. No matter how you disguise yourself, I can still recognize you. No matter how you disguise yourself, your smell will never change. It just so happens that my nose is special. As long as I’ve smelled someone’s smell, I can recognize them even if they turn into ashes.”</p><p>“This works too?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>He had never thought of this.</p><p>hahaha, miss Xie, what a coincidence. I haven’t seen you for a long time, and I miss you. Unfortunately, I have something urgent to attend to now. Please make way for me and we can talk another day.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and revealed his original voice.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, it’s not easy to meet you. Don’t even think about leaving. I’ve said it the last time that I’ll trample you ruthlessly under my feet the next time I see you. Come on, fight me.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming unkindly.</p><p>“I said, I’m not free right now. If I want to play, I’ll play with you in the future.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice sank. He was in a hurry to go to the forsaken land and had no time to fight with Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I don’t care. Don’t even think about leaving today!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blocked Lu Ming’s path arrogantly.</p><p>“Move!” He shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and pushed his palm forward. A powerful true Qi gushed out, trying to push Xie nianqing away.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s body moved slightly and a powerful true Qi surged out, canceling out Lu Ming’s true Qi.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He was a little surprised. After not seeing him for a while, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had also reached an astonishing level.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
