I’m sorry for not welcoming you!”</p><p>hahahaha! a burst of hearty laughter was heard. Hua Zhengxing strode over with a few guards.</p><p>The other concubines, ministers, princes, and princesses all bowed to Hua Zhengxing.</p><p>The valley master stood up and cupped his fists, ” “Greetings, Your Majesty. Congratulations on your 60th birthday. This is a small gift, please accept it!”</p><p>The valley master took out a Jade box and handed it to Hua Zhengxing.</p><p>“Brother Ling is too polite!”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing laughed as he accepted the jade box and passed it to a guard.</p><p>“The sect leader and elders of the mystical sword sect have arrived!”</p><p>At this time, another shout was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, walked in with a few golden-robed elders, and Feng Wuji was also at the side.</p><p>Lin Xueyi greets Your Majesty. I wish Your Majesty a longevity as long as the southern mountain. This is a small gift, please accept it!</p><p>Lin Xueyi walked over, took out a Jade box, and handed it to Hua Zhengxing.</p><p>it’s my honor that brother Lin is here. There’s no need to be so polite. Please have a seat!</p><p>Hua Zhengxing accepted the gift and said politely.</p><p>At this time, another shout rang out. It was the sect master and elders of the ghost moon saber sect, one of the five great sects, who had arrived.</p><p>Among them, one of the six heroes, the number one genius of the ghostmoon saber sect, Shangguan Yan, had also arrived.</p><p>Three of the five great sects had arrived.</p><p>In a short while, one of the five great sects, the heavenfiend sect, had also arrived.</p><p>As everyone sat down, Hua Zhengxing and the four sect leaders chatted for a while.</p><p>“The sect leader and elders of the ten direction sword sect have arrived!”</p><p>“Heavenly King Zhen has arrived!”</p><p>A few shouts rang out.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Lu Ming looked toward the main entrance.</p><p>A group of people walked in.</p><p>The person in the lead was dressed in fine clothes. His brows were like swords. Although he was middle-aged, he was extremely handsome. Just by looking at him closely, one could feel that this person had the aura to swallow mountains and rivers.</p><p>Next to him was a burly man in his fifties. He had the back of a Tiger and the waist of a bear. He was wearing a dragon robe, and as he looked around, a murderous aura could be faintly seen. He was like a general who had swept through the battlefield.</p><p>the person in the lead is the head of the ten direction Sword School, Qiu Wuyang. Beside him is the heavenly suppression King.</p><p>Hua Chi whispered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He looked at the burly man in the flood dragon robe and thought, ” So he is the Heavenly King of suppression!</p><p>Lu Ming still remembered that when he had just arrived at the imperial capital, he had taught the Heavenly king’s son, Hua Jie, a harsh lesson.</p><p>At the thought of Hua Jie, Lu Ming realized that there was a pair of eyes filled with murderous intent behind the Heavenly King. They were glaring at him fiercely. Who else could it be but Hua Jie?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at Hua Jie and pointed to his crotch.</p><p>Hua Jie’s face turned red, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Obviously, Lu Ming was referring to the incident where he peed his pants.</p><p>However, with so many important figures present, he didn’t dare to flare up. He could only grit his teeth and endure it.</p><p>“Haha, brother Qiu’s presence is a great honor to me.”</p><p>Hua Zhengxing quickly stood up and cupped his fists at Qiu Wuyang with a smile.</p><p>The other Imperial concubines, princes, and princesses also stood up and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Your Majesty is too polite. I came in a hurry today and forgot to bring a gift. Please forgive me.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang nodded.</p><p>There was no respect in his words. It could be said that he didn’t care at all.</p><p>To say the worst, he didn’t put the Emperor in his eyes at all.</p><p>The other sect Masters would still bow to him politely, but Qiu Wuyang’s attitude was cold. He even said that he didn’t have time to forget about the birthday gift.</p><p>What a childish reason!</p><p>The other sect leaders ‘expressions were somewhat unsightly.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing was even more stunned. He then forced a smile and said, ” “It’s fine as long as brother Qiu is here. There’s no need for gifts, please take a seat!”</p><p>“Second brother, I was with sect master Qiu, so I forgot to bring a gift. Please don’t take offense, haha!”</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen laughed and sat down at the side.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s body trembled in anger, and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>The attitudes of Qiu Wuyang and Heavenly King Zhen were full of contempt. They even ignored the authority of the Emperor and didn’t take the burning sun Emperor seriously.</p><p>A hint of anger flashed across Hua Zhengxing’s eyes, but he concealed it very well. In the blink of an eye, a smile appeared on his face. He returned to his seat, raised his glass, and said, it’s my honor to have all of you here today. Come, let me toast to all of you.</p><p>Everyone raised their glasses and drank it all.</p><p>haha! This is great! You are all the pillars of the burning sun Empire. I …</p><p>Hua Zhengxing laughed as he spoke, but he was interrupted at this moment.</p><p>alright, Your Majesty. We’ve drunk the wine and offered our congratulations. It’s time to talk business.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s indifferent voice made Hua Zhengxing stop in his tracks.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing, as well as a few other nobles and ministers, all had ugly expressions.</p><p>Interrupting someone’s speech was an extremely rude thing to do, let alone the king of a country.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang had completely disregarded the royal family.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, we’re here today to celebrate His Majesty’s birthday. That’s the real business. Is there anything else? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi looked at Qiu Wuyang and said coldly.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s attitude was too much.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing looked at Lin Xueyi gratefully.</p><p>“Of course there are other matters. Although the matter of His Majesty’s birthday is big, it is much smaller when compared to this matter.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang glanced at Lin Xueyi, and a trace of killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes. Then, he looked around and said, ” “Everyone, what do you think of the current power of the burning sun Empire?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes moved. They didn’t understand why Qiu Wuyang would ask such a question.</p><p>After a while, an old man cupped his fists and said, ” with the help of His Majesty and the various sect leaders, the blazing sun Empire is becoming more and more powerful. It is only a matter of time before we surpass other countries.</p><p>This old man was the Prime Minister of the burning sun Empire, and he was very loyal to the royal family.</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang flicked his sleeve and scolded.</p><p>The Prime Minister’s face turned red. He was the Prime Minister, and yet he was being berated in public. Where was his face?</p><p>However, in front of Qiu Wuyang, he did not dare to refute and could only suppress his anger.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing’s expression did not look good either.</p><p>Scolding the Prime Minister was indirectly scolding him.</p><p>currently, the 36 countries of Emperor Yun are all working hard to rule and their strength is constantly improving. The burning sun Empire is surrounded by strong enemies and many countries are eyeing them covetously. Most of them are stronger than the burning sun Empire.</p><p>“I’m sure you all know about this. Out of the 36 empires in Emperor Yun, the blazing sun Empire is considered to be at the bottom.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang looked around and said loudly.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed slightly. Qiu Wuyang was right about this. Among the 36 kingdoms of Emperor Yun, the blazing sun Empire was indeed considered to be at the lower tier.</p><p>The surrounding countries were also eyeing them covetously.</p><p>the blazing sun Empire is full of geniuses and powerhouses. Do you know why we are getting weaker and weaker? ”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang asked.</p><p>The crowd frowned, not knowing what Qiu Wuyang was trying to do.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang smiled and said, ” that is, the forces of the burning sun Empire are too scattered. They are fighting on their own. It would be strange if they are not weak.</p><p>“Oh? Qiu Wuyang, what should we do then?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi frowned and asked.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
