At the same time, he also devoured all the blood essence.</p><p>The four Grandmaster-level powerhouses of the omnidirectional Sword School were killed by Lu Ming in such a short time. Qiu changkong probably did not even dream of this.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Together with Xie nianqing and the Golden-eyed blood zombie, they soared into the sky and turned into a rainbow light, flying rapidly towards the imperial capital.</p><p>As he flew, Lu Ming refined the blood essence.</p><p>let’s see if my second bloodline can increase its level by devouring essence blood.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming transferred all the energy refined from the nine Dragon bloodline to his second bloodline.</p><p>Instantly, the second bloodline devoured the energy in a frenzy. Lu Ming could feel that the three silver chakras were shining and the strength of the second bloodline was increasing.</p><p>it’s really useful. The grade of my second bloodline can also be improved!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Heaven-defying, this was too heaven-defying.</p><p>The nine-Dragon bloodline could actually devour blood essence and upgrade the level of other bloodlines. This was too shocking.</p><p>The level of his bloodline was not important anymore. What was important was that as long as he could devour the blood essence, his bloodline could be improved infinitely.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately transferred the remaining energy essence to the second bloodline.</p><p>The combined energy of two martial Grandmaster 1-dan, one martial Grandmaster 2-dan, and one martial Grandmaster 4-dan was too strong. If the nine Dragon bloodline devoured it, it would probably level up instantly, which would attract Xie nianqing’s attention.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons could not be exposed.</p><p>However, although the blood essence was strong, it was still a drop in the bucket for the second bloodline. It was difficult for the second bloodline to level up.</p><p>The amount of energy essence required for a third level King bloodline to level up was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Xie nianqing seemed to sense that Lu Ming was a little strange, but he only took a casual glance and did not pay much attention to it.</p><p>The two of them rushed to the imperial capital at full speed.</p><p>With the two’s current cultivation, their speed was much faster than before as they flew through the air. In just slightly more than half a day, the imperial capital was already in sight.</p><p>…</p><p>The two of them returned to the imperial capital and rushed to the general Star Hall as fast as lightning.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had already learned through the thousand mile sound transmission talisman that Lu Yuntian had returned to the imperial capital safely and was in the general stars Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to see Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“Tianyun, you really did appear!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the group were about to reach the general stars Hall, a loud shout was heard. The sound of the air being torn apart could be heard as two young men appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“So it’s you guys. You’re really patient. You’ve been guarding this place like dogs. Thank you for your hard work.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered as he looked at the two young men with a mocking smile.</p><p>These two young men were the genius disciples from the ten directions Sword School who had charged into the general Star Hall to kill Lu Ming. They had declared that they would stop Lu Ming outside the general Star Hall. He did not expect that the two of them would still be here after so many days.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two young men were furious, and two powerful auras rushed out of their bodies.</p><p>The aura of a peak second level martial ancestor realm expert was like a mountain.</p><p>The people nearby were all alarmed.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s happening?”</p><p>“Those are the two golden disciples of the ten direction Sword School. The other side is tianyun.”</p><p>“I know. Half a month ago, two disciples from the ten directions Sword School charged into the general Star Hall, wanting to kill tianyun. In the end, they failed and were stopped by the elders of the general Star Hall and the experts of the royal family. In the end, the disciples of the ten directions Sword School declared that they would kill tianyun outside the general Star Hall.”</p><p>“There’s actually such a thing? Now that tianyun has left the general Star Hall, he’s finished. The experts of the general Star Hall will have no reason to interfere.”</p><p>Tianyun is in danger!</p><p>Countless people in the surroundings were attracted by the commotion and gathered around, discussing spiritedly.</p><p>“Tianyun, you shouldn’t have said those words. Ever since you said those words, your tragic ending has already been determined. Today, I’ll let you know what pain is, what it means to be unable to die.”</p><p>One of the disciples from the ten directions sword sect had an extremely gloomy expression. Killing intent burst out from his body, and it was as if it had materialized.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to call them dogs?</p><p>Damn it, this was definitely a thousand times worse. Who were they? The Golden disciples of the ten directions sword sect, the proud sons of heaven, had always been pampered. When had anyone dared to say this about them?</p><p>don’t f * cking babble. If you want to fight, then do it. If you don’t, then get lost. Get as far away as you can.</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all stunned. This tianyun was too overbearing, wasn’t he? he actually dared to berate the geniuses of the ten direction Sword School like this! These were a few young grandmasters! They were incomparably powerful, and many of the older generation had to be extremely respectful in front of them.</p><p>Where did tianyun get his confidence from?</p><p>I think tianyun is going all out. He knows that he’s going to die, so why don’t he just curse to his heart’s content!</p><p>I think so too. It must be so!</p><p>The surrounding people were discussing.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill! Tianyun, I’m going to kill you and feed your corpse to the dogs!”</p><p>A young man from the ten directions sword sect shouted. He couldn’t suppress the anger in his heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The combat sword trembled and a terrifying sword ray, sparkling and dazzling, was slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The others in the surroundings were extremely shocked and quickly retreated. This sword was too terrifying. If they were swept by the aftermath, they would either die or be injured.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body was as tall as a mountain. He stood there, not moving.</p><p>Beside him, Xie nianqing and the Golden-eyed blood corpse were also standing there motionless, as if they didn’t see anything.</p><p>dumbfounded! Tianyun and the others have been scared silly!</p><p>Many people roared in their hearts and came to this conclusion.</p><p>The sword gleam was about to slash down on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stretched out his palm. His palm glowed and a long spear condensed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword gleam slashed at the long spear that Lu Ming had condensed and a deafening boom was heard.</p><p>Then, everyone saw that Lu Ming’s body did not move at all. His clothes did not even flutter. He used the long spear condensed from essential Qi in his hand to block the sword gleam steadily.</p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p>He blocked it. How could Lu Ming block the sword of the youth from the omnidirectional sword sect so easily?</p><p>Could it be that the young man from the ten directions sword sect had not used his full strength?</p><p>The eyes of the youth from the ten directions sword sect almost popped out, and his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Others might not know, but he knew very well that he had used all his strength in that sword attack.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had been forced to flee in a sorry state under this sword attack. He did not even have the strength to fight back.</p><p>How much time had passed? How was it possible that Lu Ming could easily block his sword?</p><p>“This is your strength? You haven’t changed at all, you’re just making progress on the spot. How disappointing!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in a slightly mocking tone.</p><p>Then-</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled. The body of the spear shook and a terrifying force exploded.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The young man from the ten directions Sword School let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew out like a cannonball. He crashed through more than Ten Walls before he could stabilize himself, but blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
