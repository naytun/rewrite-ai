He had to improve his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>But now, there was still a long way to go before he could reach the profound level of Fire Force. Two months was far from enough, even if he cultivated in the earth cave.</p><p>It was better to fully comprehend wind force. If wind force could reach small success, then his battle strength would increase sharply in a short time.</p><p>God Wind Valley was a huge Valley in the North of General Star Hall.</p><p>That’s right, this wasn’t a Valley, but a stretch of valleys.</p><p>Among them, the valleys were densely packed and criss-crossed, and there were many of them.</p><p>If one were to look down from the sky, one would be able to see that these valleys seemed to have been created by a peerless expert with a flurry of slashes.</p><p>In these valleys, the wind whistled and tornadoes rolled. Some of the tornadoes could even tear steel into pieces. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, it was also the best place to cultivate wind attribute martial techniques and even comprehend the force of the wind.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the entrance of the divine Wind Valley, he could hear the whistling sound of the strong wind.</p><p>Lu Ming was not the only one who came. At the same time, a few other young men were there as well.</p><p>it’s 10 spiritual crystals a day to cultivate in the God Wind Valley. You’ll have to go in for a few days.</p><p>At the entrance of God Wind Valley, a brawny man looked at one of the young men and said coldly.</p><p>10 spiritual crystals for a day? isn’t that too expensive? ”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>“If you think it’s expensive, then leave quickly. No one begged you to come here to cultivate.”</p><p>The brawny man glanced at the young man coldly, then ignored him and looked at the others.</p><p>The others had no choice but to take out their spiritual crystals.</p><p>“I need to cultivate for ten days!”</p><p>A young man took out 100 spiritual crystals and handed them to the brawny man.</p><p>“I’ll take half a month, no, I’ll take ten days!”</p><p>The other young man took out 100 spiritual crystals with a pained expression.</p><p>The brawny man’s face darkened. He kept them one by one and registered them.</p><p>“How about you? how many days do you need?”</p><p>The strong man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Look at this!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and the Golden token that Hua Chi had given him appeared.</p><p>The brawny man’s expression changed as soon as he saw the Golden token. He revealed a gentle smile and said, please come in. You don’t need to pay any spiritual crystals. You can cultivate as long as you want.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the token and smiled. It seemed that this token was really useful.</p><p>wait a minute, I’m not convinced. Why can he enter without using spiritual crystals? and he can cultivate as long as he wants. It’s not fair!</p><p>A young man shouted.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The brawny man coldly snorted as a vast aura rose from his body. He stared at the young man and said,”Didn’t you see his token? “With this token alone, his status is ten times or even a hundred times higher than yours. Also, don’t talk about fairness in front of me. This world has never been fair. Everything depends on strength. If you don’t have strength, then shut up!”</p><p>The brawny man shouted coldly, causing the expressions of the few young men to change drastically. They shut their mouths and dared not speak. They looked at Lu Ming with envy.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. He strode into the Holy Wind Valley.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>As soon as he entered the divine Wind Valley, he could hear a terrifying whistling sound. Gusts of strong wind blew against his face, and Lu Ming’s body was almost blown away.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential Qi and a light flashed on his body. His body was as still as a mountain. No matter how strong the wind was, it could not move him at all.</p><p>“We’ve only just entered the valley, yet there’s already such a strong wind. This place is indeed a good place to cultivate wind attribute martial skills and comprehend wind force.”</p><p>He didn’t stop and continued to walk forward.</p><p>Soon, they reached the end of the valley. On the left and right, there were two valleys, and the wind was even more violent.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming chose the side where the wind was the strongest and walked.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming turned left and right and walked through seven to eight valleys.</p><p>Here, the wind was so strong that it was already very terrifying.</p><p>Strong gales swept through the air, even forming wind blades in the air.</p><p>The wind blades were like knives, constantly hitting Lu Ming’s protective true Qi, causing waves of ripples.</p><p>what a terrifying wind blade. The wind blade here is equivalent to a full-force attack of a first grade master realm.</p><p>The many wind blades were like a large group of first grade master realm martial artists that kept attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>The essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body was being consumed rapidly.</p><p>“Not only can I comprehend wind force here, but I can also practice the ancient shield technique with half the effort!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Then, two ancient shields were formed in front of him.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The wind blades kept bombarding the shield, but the shield didn’t move at all.</p><p>“It’s not powerful enough. Go deeper!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward and the power of the wind blades grew stronger.</p><p>It was equivalent to a full-powered strike from a second grade master realm, followed by a third grade master realm, a fourth grade master realm …</p><p>After Lu Ming had walked through more than ten valleys, the power of the wind blades here was already equivalent to a full-force attack of a first grade Grandmaster.</p><p>An attack equivalent to a first grade great Martial Master realm was terrifying. Even steel would be torn into pieces in an instant.</p><p>Most importantly, there weren’t just one or two wind blades here. They were densely packed and constantly bombarding the area.</p><p>Clang clang …</p><p>The wind blades struck the ancient shield, creating a series of metal-striking sounds and sparks.</p><p>The ancient shield in front of Lu Ming started to shake.</p><p>In particular, two ancient shields were not enough to defend against the wind blades from all directions. Lu Ming was completely immersed in it. He kept controlling the ancient shield to fly up and down to block the wind blades while carefully sensing the changes in the surrounding wind.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming was cultivating the ancient shield art while comprehending the force of the wind at the same time.</p><p>Cultivating like this, the speed of improvement was terrifying.</p><p>However, the consumption of Lu Ming’s essential Qi was extremely huge.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi was much more condensed than ordinary people. However, he had no choice but to leave after cultivating for an hour.</p><p>If it were an ordinary person, it would be impossible to cultivate like this.</p><p>After leaving the place, Lu Ming comprehended the three palm strikes while recovering his essential Qi.</p><p>After his essential Qi had recovered, Lu Ming entered the valley again and continued with his high-intensity cultivation.</p><p>One month later, the ancient shield art broke through to the third level.</p><p>As for wind force, it was also improving rapidly. Although it hadn’t reached the minor completion, it wasn’t far away.</p><p>As for the three Palms, he had not cultivated it successfully but Lu Ming felt that he would be able to do it soon.</p><p>I’ve been cultivating for a month. I’m going out to rest for two days.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming left the divine Wind Valley.</p><p>Not long after he returned to his residence, Ming Feng, Mingzhu, and Ming Cheng found Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun, everyone says that I’m a martial arts fanatic, but I think you’re even crazier than me. You’ve been cultivating all day long, and I can’t even see your shadow.”</p><p>Ming Cheng shouted at Lu Ming when he saw him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, you’re definitely going to enter the blood ant secret realm this time, right?”</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“The blood ant secret realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. Then, he had a flash of inspiration.</p><p>Could it be the plane that Hua Chi said he entered with the omnidirectional sword sect?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
