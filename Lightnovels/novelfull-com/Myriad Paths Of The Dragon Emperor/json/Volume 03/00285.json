There are words on it.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>At the intersection of each road, there was a platform. In front of the platform, there was a stone tablet.</p><p>Everyone went up to take a look, and their eyes lit up.</p><p>The meaning of the stone tablet was obvious. It said that this was the competition path given to the disciples by the cloud Emperor Palace. Each path was set up with inscription formations and only one person could walk on each path.</p><p>Only eight people could pass through the eight paths, and there would be some treasures as rewards along the way.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“This path is mine.”</p><p>“It’s mine,”</p><p>Immediately, more than a dozen people rushed to the platform on the first road.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>But immediately after, a ball of hot fist energy, like the sun, blasted towards the platform.</p><p>More than a dozen young experts were directly blasted into ashes without even letting out a scream.</p><p>A young man stepped forward and looked around.</p><p>It was the six extremes of yang.</p><p>Most of the People’s faces changed.</p><p>It was clear that yang Liuji had taken the first path, and this path was now his.</p><p>“The second one!”</p><p>Some people rushed towards the second path.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>An iron rod swept across, and a dozen young men screamed as they were swept off the platform.</p><p>A young man with messy hair and an iron rod in his hand walked onto the second platform.</p><p>“One of the 50 super rookies of blood Zhao, blood staff Iron Demon.”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. They wanted to rush forward, but Iron Demon was extremely powerful. With one iron rod, he swept away thousands of soldiers.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of sword light appeared on the platform of the third path like a flying immortal.</p><p>It was Duan Ling, one of the nine talents of the Dark Moon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the sixth path, there was also an expert, one of the 50 super rookies of blood Zhao.</p><p>Immediately, the first, second, third, and sixth paths were all occupied.</p><p>The four of them stood on top, and the others retreated in fear. No one went up to court death.</p><p>As for the remaining four paths, the competition was intense.</p><p>Groups of people charged forward and fought with all their might, causing people to fall one after another.</p><p>This was the martial arts Grandmaster’s battlefield. It was difficult for the Grandmaster realm martial artists to interfere.</p><p>“I want one.”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured. Then, his body moved and he rushed towards the fifth path.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s demonic palm print was a martial technique of unknown level. As her cultivation level increased, its power became more and more terrifying.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>With a series of screams, seven or eight martial ancestor realm experts were sent flying by Xie nianqing. Some of them even exploded in the air.</p><p>“So strong, who is this person?”</p><p>Someone was shocked.</p><p>“If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted coldly.</p><p>Some people didn’t believe it and wanted to rush forward, but they were killed by Xie nianqing in one move.</p><p>The remaining people were helpless and could only move to other routes.</p><p>“Then I’ll have one too!”</p><p>Lu Ming dashed toward the eighth path with the Golden-eyed blood corpse following closely behind.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A ray of Saber Light was aimed at Lu Ming’s head. It was very powerful.</p><p>He was a warrior at the peak of the first level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The demon subduing spear appeared in his hand, and he swept it out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man’s body flew out like a cannonball. He flew for an unknown distance and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a cold voice rang out near Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and he was amused. Wasn’t this the young man in the brocade robe who had snatched the Yiyuan ancient spiritual pill?</p><p>The young man in the brocade robe swept his gaze across Lu Ming’s surroundings. Then, his eyes gleamed coldly as he sneered,”Brat, now that you’re here alone, I’d like to see how you die.”</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m afraid that you’re far from enough.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Brat, it’s useless to be stubborn. Die!”</p><p>The young man in the brocade robe shouted as he emitted a violent aura.</p><p>Third stage martial ancestor realm. This embroidered-robed youth had actually reached the third stage martial ancestor realm.</p><p>A while ago, his cultivation was still at the peak of the second level of the martial ancestor realm. It seemed that the youth in the brocade robe had a fortuitous encounter in the past few days, allowing his cultivation to break through.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The purple light on the young man’s body turned golden in the blink of an eye. He struck out with his palm and a golden true dragon flew out, pouncing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look and pulled out his gun.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Golden true dragon was like tofu. It was smashed into pieces by Lu Ming’s spear. The violent Spear’s gleam continued to sweep toward the young man in embroidered robes.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The embroidered-robed youth cried out in disbelief.</p><p>His cultivation had broken through to the third tier of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. Moreover, Lu Ming was alone. He had thought that killing Lu Ming would be a piece of cake. He had never expected that the martial arts technique he was most proud of would be shattered by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>At this moment, he shouted and used all his strength to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The violent spear radiance struck his body, shattering all his defenses. His body made a series of cracking sounds, and many of his bones were broken. He fell off the platform like a pile of meat paste. He couldn’t be more dead.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked the storage ring of the young man in the brocade robe into his hand. Then, he went to kill the others.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was direct and domineering. He formed a huge spear ray with his long spear and swept away the Army.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Those young men were swept away by Lu Ming like broken gunny sacks. The bodies of those with weaker cultivation exploded immediately.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was the only one standing proudly on the platform at the intersection of the eighth road with a gun.</p><p>“Who is this person? He’s too strong.”</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming in shock and did not dare to step forward.</p><p>Just like that, the fifth and eighth paths were occupied by Lu Ming and Xie nianqing respectively.</p><p>There was only the fourth and seventh paths left, and the competition was extremely fierce.</p><p>The killing continued, and blood flowed like a river. In the sky, inscriptions appeared, and blood refining crystals were formed.</p><p>A moment later, the fourth and seventh paths also had their respective owners.</p><p>The fourth option was a bald youth with the strength of a peak martial ancestor 3-dan. He was extremely powerful. Of course, compared to the geniuses of the burning sun six heroes, he was still slightly inferior.</p><p>The seventh path was occupied by a short and chubby youth. This person’s cultivation was also at the peak of the 3rd level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>No one dared to challenge the eight paths.</p><p>Charge!</p><p>Then, the people on the eight platforms all rushed towards the road.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed toward the mountain road, the Golden-eyed blood zombie following closely behind.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse was not human. That was why it could travel with Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after he rushed out, light and shadows flickered in front of him. Four Tiger-shaped demonic beasts suddenly appeared and blocked his way.</p><p>It was obvious that these four demonic beasts were formed by the inscription formation and were not real.</p><p>“Four demonic beasts, all in the early stage of the martial ancestor 3-dan.”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell the strength of the four demonic beasts at a glance.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The four monsters pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
