Every time he struck with the spear, it was as if there was a stone tablet integrated into the spear. This made Lu Ming’s every move and every form extremely terrifying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a sweep of the spear, a demonic beast was sent flying.</p><p>The four demonic beasts were like four leather balls that were constantly sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>After about 100 moves, the four demonic beasts dispersed.</p><p>although these demonic beasts are not as strong as real demonic beasts, they are not that far off. It seems that if I unleash my full power now, I should be able to fight against an ordinary martial arts Grandmaster 5-dan fighter.</p><p>Lu Ming had a rough estimate of his own ability.</p><p>After all, the difference in strength between each major realm was different.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming walked forward. There was another ball of light in front of him.</p><p>This time, it was a secret manual.</p><p>Lu Ming flipped it open and was overjoyed.</p><p>The wind and cloud mantra was an earth grade upper level cultivation technique.</p><p>This was an earth grade upper level cultivation technique.</p><p>Cultivation techniques were different from martial arts techniques. Cultivation techniques were the foundation of a martial artist. Only with good cultivation techniques could one continue to cultivate and break through.</p><p>A good cultivation technique would allow one to cultivate faster, and the true Qi that one could cultivate would be more condensed and robust. One could also cultivate to a higher realm.</p><p>A cultivation technique could create a sect.</p><p>For example, the mystical sword sect’s sect cultivation technique was called the mystical sword technique.</p><p>An upper earth level cultivation skill was many times more precious than a martial technique of the same level.</p><p>Earth grade top-rank was much more precious than earth grade low-rank.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he kept it.</p><p>Then, he continued to move upwards.</p><p>Not long after, eight demonic beasts at the peak of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>One of the demonic beasts roared and pounced on Lu Ming like the wind.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw out a palm and the huge palm print collided with the demonic beast.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat by a huge force.</p><p>As for the demonic beast, it only took a few steps back.</p><p>The strength of a demonic beast at the peak of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm had already surpassed Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Blood corpse!”</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming asked the Golden-eyed blood zombie to take action.</p><p>Lu Ming would definitely not be able to defeat eight demonic beasts at the peak of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm. He might as well let the blood corpse take action.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood corpse roared and pounced forward. It waved its claws continuously, sending out claw lights.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>The eight demonic beasts at the peak of the 5th martial ancestor realm were torn apart by the blood corpse like rags and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not find it strange. He had long discovered that the Golden-eyed blood corpse was in the 7th tier of the martial ancestor realm. It was extremely powerful and could easily deal with a 5th tier martial ancestor realm demonic beast.</p><p>After killing the demonic beast, Lu Ming advanced forward with ease.</p><p>There was still a ball of light waiting for him in front.</p><p>This time, it was a wooden box. Lu Ming opened the wooden box and found a strange piece of metal lying inside.</p><p>“Is this the heavenly Fire lavagold?”</p><p>After a careful identification, Lu Ming’s heart trembled and he was overjoyed.</p><p>The Skyfire lavagold was a rare treasure of heaven and earth. It was also the main material for forging a fifth-grade spiritual weapon.</p><p>A fifth-level spiritual weapon was known as a King’s spiritual weapon and was a weapon used by martial Kings.</p><p>Even a martial King would be envious of such a precious metal.</p><p>“Haha, we’re rich, we’re really rich.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and kept it happily.</p><p>there’s an upper earth grade cultivation technique and a Heavenly Fire lavagold. I’m really looking forward to what’s next.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>Carrying the blood corpse, he continued to move upwards.</p><p>In front of him, a figure stood there with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Yang six extremes!</p><p>The last two paths had finally converged. Lu Ming and yang Liuji had finally met.</p><p>I didn’t expect that someone could really walk up here. It seems that you have some skills. Now, I’ll give you a chance. Go back the way you came and I can spare your life.</p><p>Yang Liuji put his hands behind his back and looked down at Lu Ming, his tone extremely overbearing.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? I’ll return these words to you. F * ck off, or you’ll be the one to die.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s face instantly darkened as he said in a low voice, I promise you that you will regret what you said.</p><p>His voice was cold and filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and walked up the stairs unhurriedly, step by step.</p><p>When Lu Ming approached the intersection of the two paths, demonic beasts began to form at that spot.</p><p>There were 16 of them in total, and each of them was emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>The sixteen demonic beasts were all in the early stage of the martial ancestor realm Level 6. When they gathered together, their aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The sixteen demonic beasts roared and pounced at yang Liuji.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Yang Liuji coldly shouted and threw a punch.</p><p>A sun appeared in the sky, and a terrifyingly hot energy exploded.</p><p>The demonic beasts exploded one after another, turning into a rain of light and dissipating.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. The geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking were indeed powerful and terrifying. A demonic beast in the early stage of the martial ancestor sixth realm was completely crushed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Like fireworks, the sixteen beasts exploded in the air one after another, creating a rain of light.</p><p>“Now, you know the difference between you and me. But it’s too late to leave now.”</p><p>After Yang Liuji killed the 16 demonic beasts, he glared at Lu Ming and strode toward him.</p><p>who said I’m leaving? you’re so full of yourself. Let’s talk after you defeat my pet.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and waved his hand.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood corpse roared and pounced forward.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>When yang Liuji saw the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s true appearance, his eyes narrowed and he punched out.</p><p>The fist energy condensed into a sun and shot towards the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burning fist force collided with the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s claw radiance.</p><p>The energy wreaked havoc in all directions, while the Golden-eyed blood corpse and yang Liuji both trembled and were forced back seven to eight steps.</p><p>haha, looks like you’re nothing much after all. You can’t even beat one of my pets.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud.</p><p>However, he was secretly shocked.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s cultivation should be at the early stage of the 5th martial ancestor realm, but his combat strength couldn’t be judged by his cultivation. He could at least fight two levels above him.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>&Nbsp; yang Liuji was shaken, his eyes bursting with endless rage. His long hair fluttered in the wind, and a scorching aura filled the air.</p><p>The force of fire. Moreover, the force of fire was extremely strong and stronger than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“This six extreme Yang’s Fire Force is probably about to reach perfection.” Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>“Divine sun fist!”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared, his entire body emitting a bright light like a sun.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He punched out a few times in a row, and each punch was accompanied by a sun.</p><p>The Suns shot towards the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie roared and its body was covered in a thick blood-red light. It reached out with its claws, which were extremely sharp and seemed to be able to tear the space apart.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Continuous crashing sounds rang out, and the rumbles continued.</p><p>The scene was extremely shocking. It was as if Suns were being extinguished in the sky one after another, like a scene from the end of the world.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared. It was not afraid of death and its body was impervious to swords and Spears. Although it was in the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm, its combat strength was not something that an ordinary 7th level martial ancestor realm could compare to.</p><p>After dozens of moves, the Golden-eyed blood corpse started to gain the upper hand.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
