In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in closed-door cultivation for a month.</p><p>His physical body had improved the fastest in the past month.</p><p>After using three thousand spiritual herbs, Lu Ming’s physical body reached the fifth grade.</p><p>However, after reaching Tier 5, using some Level 1 and Level 2 spiritual herbs to cultivate would have very poor effects. Only Level 3 spiritual herbs had some effect, and Level 4 spiritual herbs were even better.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have many level-four spiritual herbs.</p><p>Lu Ming still had more than eight thousand spiritual herbs on him. However, he felt that even if he refined all of them, he could not cultivate his body to the sixth grade.</p><p>The higher the level of the body, the more energy it required.</p><p>Also, after reaching the martial arts Grandmaster realm, one’s comprehension of martial arts techniques would be much faster.</p><p>After a month of bitter cultivation and continuous battles with himself, Lu Ming’s martial arts skills had improved at a rapid pace. He had cultivated the ancient shield mantra to the sixth level in one go and could condense six ancient shields at once. His defensive power had been greatly enhanced.</p><p>As for the three Palms, he had successfully cultivated the second palm in one go, the beast palm.</p><p>A palm struck out, a huge beast palm blasted out, its power was a level stronger than the human path palm.</p><p>The reason why he was able to improve so quickly was because of the third platform.</p><p>Of course, he had to pay more than 600000 crystals for it.</p><p>Now, with Lu Ming’s cultivation at the second tier of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, he would need 10000 spiritual crystals to condense a figure that looked exactly like him.</p><p>Each time, it could last for six hours.</p><p>The consumption was extremely shocking.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming had a net worth of more than fifty million, he could not afford to spend it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s ability could be said to have reached its peak.</p><p>Although his cultivation was still at the early stage of the 2-dan martial ancestor realm, he could kill Qiu changlie in one move if he were to fight him.</p><p>On the other hand, Li Ping had already arrived at the imperial capital half a month ago to meet Lu Yuntian.</p><p>When the two met, they were naturally full of warmth. They stayed together every day and were reluctant to part.</p><p>During this time, Xie nianqing had also been cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>As for the Golden-eyed blood corpse, Lu Ming had asked it to lie dormant in a place.</p><p>That day, Hua Chi came to Lu Ming in a hurry and brought him a piece of shocking news.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire had sent out a million troops to attack the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>The ghost moon saber sect in the North had already asked for help from the burning sun Empire.</p><p>The imperial family’s two armies at the northern border also asked for help.</p><p>The entire blazing sun Empire was shaken.</p><p>Although the yin Yue Empire and the blazing sun Empire had always been in constant conflict, it was still rare for them to dispatch an army of one million to attack. In fact, there were only a few times in history.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the royal family will be sending an elite army this time, as well as some young powerhouses that the royal family has been secretly cultivating. They’ll head north. On one hand, it’s to boost the reputation of the royal family, and on the other hand, it’s to train these young powerhouses.”</p><p>however, as you know, all geniuses are proud and unruly. No one is willing to submit to the other. My father wanted to choose someone to be the commander of this Army and subdue these young experts, but after thinking about it, only you are suitable.</p><p>Hua Chi said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>yes, there’s no one more suitable than you. To tell you the truth, some of these young experts are geniuses from star cluster Hall, and some of them were secretly recruited by the royal family and sent to the blood Zhao Empire’s great sun mansion to cultivate since they were young. They all have their eyes on the top of their heads, and ordinary people can’t subdue them.</p><p>Hua Chi explained with a bitter smile.</p><p>“But father said that he won’t force you. If you don’t want to go, he will find someone else.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Yes, why not?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After being in seclusion for so long, he wanted to go out and train himself. The battlefield was undoubtedly the best place to train.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you agree? That’s great. I’ll go back and report to my father. If everything goes well, we’ll set off in two days.”</p><p>Hua Chi was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Hua Chi then took his leave.</p><p>“I’ll also go and bid farewell to father and mother!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming went to Lu Yuntian’s residence.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping did not object to the news.</p><p>“A martial artist must experience a series of life-and-death situations in order to reach the peak. Ming ‘er, go ahead!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was very supportive.</p><p>Back then, as a member of the Lu clan, Lu Yuntian had often gone out to explore in his pursuit of martial arts. It was only then that he had unintentionally discovered the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, the battlefield is extremely dangerous. You must be careful!”</p><p>Although Li Ping did not object, she could not help but be worried. She warned him seriously.</p><p>“Father, mother, don’t worry. Ming ‘er will be fine.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and assured the two elders.</p><p>Two days passed quickly.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming brought the Golden-eyed blood corpse to the general Star Hall’s training ground. The Army was gathering there.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t even think about ditching me.”</p><p>Xie nianqing appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s wrong? You can’t bear to leave me?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Who can’t bear to leave you? I’m afraid that you’ll run away or die on the battlefield. If that’s the case, who can I find to settle the score with? how can I step on you?”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted.</p><p>“Haha, then come with me. But I heard that it’s cold in the North. You have to warm my bed at night!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and walked forward.</p><p>“Warm your head, in your dreams!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s fierce voice could be heard as the two of them walked further and further away.</p><p>……</p><p>Rows of armored soldiers stood in front of the field commander of the general Star Hall. These soldiers were all tall and burly, and they emitted a powerful and murderous aura.</p><p>With one look, one could tell that they were all elite soldiers, veterans who had gone through the baptism of war.</p><p>There was a total of twenty thousand soldiers.</p><p>The sunlight shone on the armors of the 20000-strong Army, giving off a cold glow.</p><p>At the top of the martial arts field stood dozens of people.</p><p>Most of them were young men in their twenties, and each of them had a strong and profound aura. Even the weakest of them was a ninth grade great Martial Master. There were ten young men whose auras were as strong as mountains, and they were clearly martial ancestor realm experts.</p><p>Among these ten people, seven of them were the strongest experts in star cluster Hall, equivalent to the gold disciples of the five great sects.</p><p>The remaining three people had the strongest auras. As they looked around, a faint sense of pride could be seen.</p><p>They were the geniuses that the royal family had sent to the great sun mansion to cultivate.</p><p>In the middle stood the Emperor of the burning sun Empire, Hua Zhengxing.</p><p>Next to Hua Zhengxing was Hua Chi.</p><p>“Your Majesty, who is our commander? Why isn’t he here yet? What arrogance to have His Majesty wait here.”</p><p>&Nbsp; a young man who was cultivating in the great sun Prefecture shouted unhappily.</p><p>that’s right. I don’t think he has any respect for His Majesty. In my opinion, we should just remove him from his position and let senior brother Huaying be the Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>Another young man who was cultivating in the great sun mansion said.</p><p>The Hua Ying He was talking about was a young man in a golden robe. He was the last young man to cultivate in great sun mansion.</p><p>This man was extraordinary and had the aura of a King. He was a member of the Royal Hua family, but he was not a direct descendant. He was from the branch.</p><p>However, his talent was extremely terrifying. He was a rare genius in the past hundred years. He had been noticed by the Emperor and sent to the great sun Prefecture to cultivate. His cultivation was unfathomable now.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
