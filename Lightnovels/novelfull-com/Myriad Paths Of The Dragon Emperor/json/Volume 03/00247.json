At this moment, he finally remembered that this was the Emperor sky auction house, and du Zhi was a member of the Emperor sky divine Palace. Even if he killed du Zhi, the ten swords sect wouldn’t dare to let out a fart.</p><p>Qiuming’s body stiffened at the thought of this, and he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Senior, senior, I was wrong. I was just a bit impatient just now. I hope senior doesn’t take offense!”</p><p>Qiuming quickly cried out and begged.</p><p>“Get back to your room!”</p><p>Du Zhi shouted.</p><p>Qiuming hurried back to vip Room No. 3 as if he had been pardoned.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>After qiuming returned to the VIP room, he let out a low roar. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Just now, he had lost a lot of face. He would definitely become a laughing stock. This was all because of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Investigate! I must find out who that kid is! I’m going to grind his bones to dust!”</p><p>Qiuming growled.</p><p>senior brother qiuming, I know who he is!</p><p>Suddenly, a young man who had been silent the entire time spoke.</p><p>“You know?”</p><p>Qiuming looked at the young man.</p><p>“This man is tianyun, tianyun of the general stars Hall. I will never forget his voice no matter what,”</p><p>The young man said through gritted teeth.</p><p>This young man was one of the six geniuses from the ten direction sword sect who had comprehended force in the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>“Tianyun? it’s him? Good, very good. I came here to kill him, but now he actually dares to snatch the innate original liquid from me. He really brought this on himself.”</p><p>Qiuming said coldly.</p><p>senior brother qiuming, there are only two days left before tianyun challenges a person two levels above him at the DI Tian battle arena. We’ll go kill him then. You still want to challenge the record of the scorching sun six heroes? dream on!</p><p>The pale-faced young man sneered.</p><p>alright, I’ll let him live for two more days. I’ll let him have these nine drops of primordial origin liquid first. When I kill him, the primordial origin liquid will be mine.</p><p>Qiuming said coldly.</p><p>300000 spiritual crystals. Is there a higher price? ”</p><p>In the hall, du Zhi continued to host the auction.</p><p>The audience was silent. This auction was not targeted at powerhouses above the martial Grandmaster realm. Most of them were martial artists in the Grandmaster realm.</p><p>300,000 spiritual crystals was not a small amount for a martial Grandmaster, let alone a Grandmaster.</p><p>Therefore, no one continued to bid.</p><p>Du Zhi asked three times but no one made a bid. The nine drops of primordial origin liquid were successfully won by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming paid the spirit crystals and kept the stone in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>The auction came to an end. Lu Ming, Ming Cheng, and the rest returned to the general Star Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming then entered the Supreme shrine and took out the stone.</p><p>The stone was about the size of a fist, and it gave off a shocking amount of essence Qi when held in his hand.</p><p>There were nine drops of primordial origin liquid sealed inside.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He held the stone in his hand and squeezed it hard.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone cracked open, and an even denser essence Qi spread out. Then, a drop of primordial original liquid seeped out from the crack.</p><p>The innate original liquid was as black as ink, but it also emitted a little bit of luster. It was very magical.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and inhaled the drop of primordial origin liquid. He placed the rest into a Jade box and circulated the flaming Vajra art to begin refining.</p><p>The connate original liquid transformed into an endless amount of essence that seeped into his muscles, bones, and bones. Under the guidance of the flaming Vajra Arts, it continuously strengthened Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical strength increased rapidly.</p><p>His fleshly body, which had been stuck at complete grade two, also began to break through.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s body trembled. His bones and bones emitted crackling sounds like fried beans. His muscles squirmed continuously and only calmed down after a long time.</p><p>third-grade body! I’ve finally achieved initial success in the third-grade body!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his face full of joy.</p><p>The innate original liquid was indeed known as the number one body-tempering treasure in the world. Just a drop of low-grade innate original liquid had allowed Lu Ming’s physical body to break through smoothly and reach the third-grade initial success of the physical body.</p><p>His body had reached the third-grade and was even more powerful. This made Lu Ming’s explosive power stronger and his combat strength greatly improved.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, he swallowed the second drop of primordial origin liquid and began refining it.</p><p>At the third-grade body, it was more difficult to improve as compared to the second-grade body. However, with the help of the innate stock solution, Lu Ming’s body was still improving rapidly.</p><p>After more than a day, Lu Ming had cultivated the flaming Vajra Arts to the great circle stage in one go. In other words, Lu Ming’s physical body had already reached the great circle of the third-grade physical body.</p><p>The eight drops of primordial origin liquid had also been completely refined.</p><p>if I want to continue improving my physical body, I have to find a higher level physical body cultivation technique.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>The flaming Vajra Arts could only cultivate the physical body to complete third-grade at most, and that was already the limit.</p><p>what powerful physical strength! My combat strength has increased by at least 30%!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright.</p><p>At this moment, his expression changed as he heard a light knock on the door.</p><p>With a thought, he left the Supreme shrine and opened the door. It was the three Ming siblings.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, today is your challenge to cross two levels!”</p><p>Ming Feng said hurriedly.</p><p>Lu Ming smacked his head. He was so engrossed in refining the connate original liquid that he almost forgot the time.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, the four of them hurried to the Ditian battle arena.</p><p>At this moment, the Ditian battle arena was already filled with people.</p><p>All the seats were filled with people, and it could be described as a sea of people. There were no less than 300000 people.</p><p>Everyone had to pay an entrance fee of ten spiritual crystals. The income of the Ditian battle arena today was no less than three million spiritual crystals. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Ditian battle arena was in an uproar.</p><p>“Why isn’t tianyun here yet? What the hell?”</p><p>it can’t be that he’s not coming, right? no, then I’ve come for nothing. I’ll give you back your spirit crystals. I’m not watching anymore.</p><p>I gave up a mission to come and take a look. It can’t be that bad, right? ”</p><p>In the crowd, qiuming and the others stood there with a grim expression on their faces.</p><p>this tianyun, could it be that he knows that he offended senior brother qiuming during the last auction and is afraid to come? ”</p><p>“I think it’s 90% true!”</p><p>A few disciples of the ten directions Sword School deliberately discussed loudly.</p><p>This time, dozens of disciples from the ten direction sword sect had come.</p><p>The Ditian battle arena’s higher-ups, a few elders, also frowned as they looked down.</p><p>“What’s wrong with tianyun? Why isn’t he here yet?”</p><p>“I’ve already sent someone to pick them up.”</p><p>A few of the elders discussed in low voices.</p><p>Suddenly, an old man’s expression changed. He revealed a smile and said, ” “Tianyun, you’re here.”</p><p>At this moment, tianyun walked through the gates of the Ditian battle arena and strode towards the battle stage.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’re here!”</p><p>It was unknown who shouted, but the entire place suddenly quieted down. Hundreds of thousands of pairs of eyes turned to look at the entrance.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in front and strode forward. The three Ming siblings followed behind him.</p><p>haha, tianyun’s here. Looks like he’s been delayed by something.</p><p>with his talent, how could he not come? who was the one who said that tianyun would be afraid to come? he’s really using his own yardstick to measure the heart of a gentleman.</p><p>The crowd was excited, but the disciples of the ten directions Sword School had ugly expressions.</p><p>Weren’t they the ones who had said those words just now?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
