It was extremely hot.</p><p>The expressions of the he clan’s Seven Swords changed drastically.</p><p>“Force, this is force, the force of fire!”</p><p>“What a terrifying Fire Force. What kind of Fire Force is this? It’s too terrifying!”</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The he clan’s Seven Swords all roared, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, his long hair dancing in the wind. He looked like a god of fire.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming suddenly shouted and a terrifying Spear’s gleam burst out.</p><p>The sword net set up by the he clan’s Seven Swords instantly collapsed like paper.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>One of the he clan’s Seven Swords shouted.</p><p>“Retreat? You want to retreat now? It’s too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>Then, several spear lights were shot out.</p><p>A few shrieks were heard. Four of the he clan’s Seven Swords were pierced by Lu Ming’s spear ray.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The remaining three of the he clan’s Seven Swords were scared out of their wits, and they desperately ran away.</p><p>The three of them had scattered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stepped on the void and caught up with one of them in an instant.</p><p>“Ah, I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>The young man roared and charged at Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>However, when faced with Lu Ming who had cast the force of fire, he was far from being able to do so. He was directly pierced by the spear.</p><p>Then, he chased after the other two.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ll die a horrible death. The ten direction Sword School will not let you off. You’ll die without a burial ground.”</p><p>There was no doubt about the result. The remaining two were killed by Lu Ming one by one, leaving only howls of despair.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently. He did not mind at all. In a flash, he devoured all the blood essence of the seven people.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation was at the fifth grade Grandmaster realm. The blood essence of a sixth grade Grandmaster was of limited help to him. It did not take long for him to refine all of it, and Lu Ming’s cultivation had only improved slightly.</p><p>After refining the blood essence, Lu Ming headed toward the ant nest.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>At that moment, a few blood ants pounced at Lu Ming. He killed them easily and took the blood ant eggs.</p><p>However, at this moment, more blood ants crawled out of the ant nest. There were more than ten of them.</p><p>A few of them were at second grade third level.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed. He charged at the blood ants and before long, he had 20 blood ant eggs in his hands.</p><p>In addition to the previous blood ant eggs, Lu Ming had enough to exchange for four blood refinement pills.</p><p>“Kill our way in!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely excited as he charged into the ant nest.</p><p>However, the number of blood ants in the ant nest was not as high as he had imagined. There were only about fifty blood ants in total. Two hours later, Lu Ming had killed all of them.</p><p>Among them, the strongest blood ant was at Class 4 Lv 3. It had eight blood ant eggs in its abdomen.</p><p>This ant nest had given Lu Ming a total of eighty-two blood ant eggs.</p><p>“Haha, I’m so lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He left the ant nest and continued his search in the vicinity.</p><p>This small plane was very large. It was even larger than the small plane left behind by the Dongyi tribe’s ancestors that Lu Ming had previously entered.</p><p>Lu Ming had searched a radius of a hundred miles, but he felt that he had only occupied a small corner of this small plane. He did not even meet many other people.</p><p>In the next two days, Lu Ming seemed to have run out of luck. He did not encounter many blood ants that were alone, let alone ant nests. In two days, he only obtained 18 blood ant eggs.</p><p>it is said that the depths of this small plane are the nests of blood ants. There are mother ants in there. It is said that there are a large number of blood ant eggs in there, all shed by blood ants.</p><p>however, that place is extremely dangerous. Every time, a large number of experts will die there. If we don’t get much in a few days, we’ll go to the blood ant nest.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and continued to search for traces of the blood ants.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he stopped.</p><p>Because he smelled a fragrance, the fragrance of spirit herbs.</p><p>“There are spirit herbs nearby?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His eyes shone with a fiery glow.</p><p>The blood ant secret realm was a small plane that had just been created. Although this kind of plane was not very stable, it was the easiest to breed some very rare natural treasures.</p><p>It was like the birth of a treasure at the beginning of the world.</p><p>In such an environment, once a spiritual medicine was nurtured, it would definitely not be an ordinary item.</p><p>Lu Ming’s nose twitched as he noted it down. He found the right direction and left at top speed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Not long after, he discovered that there were a few figures in front of him, and they were also heading in that direction.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that they were from the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>it seems that this spiritual medicine is no small matter. It has attracted a lot of people.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile as he dashed forward.</p><p>In front of them, a wide Lake appeared.</p><p>The lake was very large, with a radius of more than a thousand meters. The water was as clear as a mirror.</p><p>At this moment, there were no less than 50 people around the lake.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked. There were so many people here.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked at the lake.</p><p>In the middle of the lake, there was a spiritual herb.</p><p>It was a dark green spirit herb with nine leaves. The leaves were crystal clear as if they were made of green jade.</p><p>In the middle of the nine leaves, there was a spirit fruit.</p><p>This spirit fruit looked like a flood Dragon, and it was extremely life-like.</p><p>“Flood Dragon Spirit fruit. This is the flood Dragon Spirit fruit.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled slightly and his eyes shone with a strong light.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit was an extremely rare spirit herb that was rarely found in the world.</p><p>Legend had it that if a Grandmaster martial artist swallowed it, his cultivation would definitely break through to the next level. Even a martial Grandmaster had a high chance of breaking through to the next level. The medicinal effects were extremely amazing.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, this was not the most attractive thing.</p><p>What attracted Lu Ming the most was the flood dragon fruit’s help to the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating the true war Dragon technique to the third stage for a very long time.</p><p>However, if one wanted to cultivate it to the fourth level, they would need six types of precious materials.</p><p>However, nothing was set in stone. It didn’t mean that these six materials were necessary. There were also some very precious natural treasures that could be worth six kinds of materials.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit was such a rare treasure.</p><p>A single flood Dragon Spirit fruit could help Lu Ming cultivate to the fourth stage of the true war Dragon technique. How could he not be tempted?</p><p>Once he cultivated to the fourth level, Lu Ming’s essential Qi would be five times that of ordinary essential Qi. Lu Ming’s combat strength would definitely increase tremendously.</p><p>“I must get the flood dragon fruit.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He looked at the flood dragon fruit carefully.</p><p>At this moment, there was a faint layer of light on the flood dragon fruit. Within the light, one could vaguely see a small flood dragon dancing. An extremely dense medicinal fragrance continuously spread out, provoking one’s nerves.</p><p>It was obvious that the flood dragon fruit had not fully ripened yet, but it was approaching its full ripeness.</p><p>This was also the reason why there were so many people gathered here, but no one had made a move yet.</p><p>The flood dragon fruit wasn’t fully ripe yet. If it was picked, its effects would be greatly reduced. It wouldn’t even have one-tenth of the medicinal effects of a fully ripe fruit. It wouldn’t be able to break through to the next realm at all.</p><p>“Tianyun, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout rang out.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
