He had also taken away his nine yang bloodline.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had also taken one of the two drops of nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>However, Martial Emperor Di Yi had underestimated nine suns Supreme. Nine suns Supreme’s nine suns bloodline was a divine bloodline, which was extremely mysterious. At the critical moment, nine suns Supreme Self-destructed his body and bloodline, and escaped with the Supreme shrine as a wisp of his remaining soul.</p><p>At the same time, it also brought out a drop of nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>Later, his Supreme divine Hall turned into a bronze pendant to avoid the pursuit of Di Yi and Martial Emperor. After decades, it finally fell into the hands of Lu Yuntian.</p><p>hahaha, I finally understand now. Di Yi, that hypocrite, accepted me as a disciple and taught me martial arts. It was a conspiracy from the beginning. From the beginning, he planned to deprive me of my nine yang bloodline. He wanted to use my nine yang bloodline to break through to the Supreme realm.</p><p>despicable, sinister. The most sinister person in the world is that old man, Di Yi.</p><p>Supreme Being of the nine suns roared hysterically, his eyes filled with a bone-chilling killing intent.</p><p>his bloodline was stripped? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered as he looked at nine suns Supreme with sympathy.</p><p>The Supreme Being of the nine suns, how similar was his experience?</p><p>The difference was that the nine suns Supreme had his bloodline taken away by the person he respected, while his bloodline had been taken away by the person he loved.</p><p>kid, you should know by now that the reason you were able to awaken your bloodline again after it was stolen was because I fused that drop of nine dragon blood essence into your body.</p><p>“The reason why I did that was because your experiences were similar to mine. It touched me. I wanted to nurture you, to nurture you into a peerless genius, to become a peerless expert. That was why I set up layers of stairs in the Supreme shrine, allowing you to grow step by step. Unfortunately, you have disappointed me too much. Your talent is not bad, but you are reckless. Do you know that you almost died just now?”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme roared, answering Lu Ming’s question.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization but he could not help but smile bitterly.</p><p>The reason why he was in such a desperate situation was because he wanted to save his father. If he could do it all over again, he would do the same.</p><p>“Brat, this is the only time you can seek refuge in the Supreme shrine. There won’t be a next time. The Supreme shrine isn’t a place for you to seek refuge. The Supreme shrine’s inscription formation won’t disappear, so you won’t be able to enter in a life and death situation.”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme martial artist said with bright eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization. It turned out that he could not enter the Supreme shrine during every great battle because the nine suns Supreme did not allow him to enter.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Every unparalleled expert had been tempered through constant life and death situations.</p><p>boy, now that you’ve merged with the blood essence of Nine Dragons and awakened the bloodline of Nine Dragons, it’s extremely magical and can continue to evolve. I don’t know how far you can go, but your future is limitless.</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“This is all thanks to senior’s help!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed. He could not help but look happy.</p><p>The nine Dragons were terrifying existences that were more powerful than the true dragon. Now that Lu Ming knew about it, he was naturally happy.</p><p>Nine suns Paragon glanced at Lu Ming and sneered,”Brat, don’t be happy too early. It won’t be long before you’ll be in deep trouble.”</p><p>“Senior, what do you mean?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>I got two drops of nine dragon blood essence. One of them fell into Di Yi’s hands. With Di Yi’s cultivation, he must have refined the nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>the blood essence of the nine Dragons can sense each other. Your cultivation is still weak, so Di Yi can’t sense you yet. According to my estimation, as soon as you break through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm, Di Yi will be able to sense you in an instant. At that time, you will inevitably be deprived of your bloodline again.</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>There was such a thing? What kind of person was Martial Emperor Di Yi? he was a top expert in the divine wilderness continent and an Overlord. If he really wanted to kill him, he could kill him tens of thousands of times with just a breath.</p><p>If Martial Emperor Di Yi discovered the nine Dragons bloodline in his body, he would definitely die. No one could save him.</p><p>Did he have to stay in the great Martial Master realm for the rest of his life and not break through to the martial ancestor realm?</p><p>No, this was impossible. As a martial artist, the goal of cultivation was to keep breaking through and become stronger.</p><p>Not allowing him to break through was worse than killing him.</p><p>“What do we do? Is there no other way?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. Suddenly, he saw a faint smile on the face of the nine suns cosmos supremacy.</p><p>“Senior, do you have any ideas?” he asked with cupped fists.</p><p>“I do have a way, but why should I help you?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. It was true. Why would the nine suns cosmos supremacy help him?</p><p>actually, I can help you if you agree to one condition.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master suddenly said.</p><p>it’s all thanks to you that Lu Ming is able to achieve what he has today. Please state your conditions. As long as it’s within Lu Ming’s means, I won’t refuse!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>okay, my condition is that you must agree to kill Di Yi and avenge me!</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master said word by word, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>he killed Martial Emperor Di Yi? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He then smiled bitterly and said, senior, are you kidding me? with my cultivation, even if Martial Emperor Di Yi stood there for me to kill, I wouldn’t be able to!</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming was not confident, but the gap was too big, so big that it was beyond his imagination.</p><p>I’m not asking you to kill Di Yi now. I want you to promise me that you will kill Di Yi in the future after you have improved your cultivation.</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“The future?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t have the confidence? But let me tell you, there will be a battle between you and Di Yi. It is inevitable. It has been inevitable since you integrated with the nine dragon blood essence. Even if you don’t go to him, he will come to you. It is only a matter of time.”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang sneered.</p><p>senior, I promise you that I will kill Di Yi one day.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke. His voice was firm and unusually determined.</p><p>The eyes of the nine suns Supreme Master lit up, and then he laughed out loud. Okay, okay, I believe you. And let me tell you, if you can kill Di Yi and take his other drop of nine dragon blood essence, you will gain endless benefits. You can even break through the martial Royal realm and enter a Supreme realm.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, nine suns Supreme was extremely excited.</p><p>Over the past few years, he had set up those stairs in order to nurture Lu Ming, hoping that he would avenge him in the future.</p><p>well, senior Huang, you know that Di Yi is a Martial Emperor. It is too difficult to reach that realm. Do you have any benefits for me? for example, divine level martial skills, divine level elixirs, divine weapons, and so on. Just give me a dozen of them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with greed as he stared at the nine suns cosmos supremacy.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
