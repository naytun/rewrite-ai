I’m not afraid of anyone below the seventh grade great master realm.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and was very confident.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been cultivating in the God Wind Valley and had gained a lot. His combat power had increased greatly and he was naturally confident.</p><p>“I believe in brother tianyun. Those people from the ten direction Sword School will definitely not be able to do anything to you.”</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>The scene of him sparring with Lu Ming a month ago was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and rushed into the light door with Ming Cheng.</p><p>When the disciples from both sides rushed into the light door, the red-haired old man pondered for a while and whispered a few words to the old man next to him. The old man nodded, turned into a rainbow light, and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi’s eyes flashed and he also said a few words to an elder of the ten direction sword sect. The elder also turned into a ray of light and disappeared.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The world spun and Lu Ming felt his body falling. There was a damp atmosphere in the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and smiled bitterly.</p><p>It turned out that he was in the air, and below him was a huge River that was constantly flowing.</p><p>The river was at least a hundred meters wide, and the water was turbulent, flowing to an unknown place.</p><p>Lu Ming was falling toward the river.</p><p>“Sky step!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and stepped into the void. His body became as light as a feather and he slowly descended.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>All of a sudden, the water below churned and a blood-red ant rushed out of the river. It waved its sharp claws and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This blood-red ant was extremely huge. It was the size of a small dog and was many times bigger than the other ants.</p><p>“Blood ant!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. With a wave of his hand, a long spear was formed and he thrust it forward.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the blood ant’s mouth, and its head exploded.</p><p>With a pull of his palm, he caught the corpse of the blood ant in his hand.</p><p>“Blood ant eggs!”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered a blood-red ball the size of a longan on the abdomen of the blood ant.</p><p>The round ball emitted a dense blood Qi. It was their target this time, the blood ant egg.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, his essential Qi was like a blade as he took the blood ant’s egg in his hand. Then, he stepped on the river with the tip of his foot and his body floated forward, landing on the riverbank.</p><p>“I didn’t expect there to be blood ants in the river.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>this blood ant is equivalent to a first grade Grandmaster martial artist. It’s a class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast.</p><p>it’s said that a blood ant of Class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast will have one blood ant egg in its abdomen. A blood ant of Class 2 Lv 3 will have two blood ant eggs in its abdomen, and a blood ant of Class 3 will have four blood ant eggs. The higher the level, the higher the level. The number of blood ant eggs that a blood ant can have is twice that of the previous level. I can only obtain blood ant eggs quickly if I find blood ants of higher levels.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and followed the river to see if he could encounter blood ants.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Soon, a blood ant emerged from the river and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>This blood ant was even bigger than the previous one, and there were two blood ant eggs in its abdomen.</p><p>Blood ants of second grade third level.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He thrust his spear forward and killed the blood ant.</p><p>In that case, Lu Ming would have three blood ant eggs.</p><p>I’m quite lucky. I’ve only just entered and I’ve already obtained three blood ant eggs. With three more, I can exchange them for a blood refinement pill.</p><p>At the thought of the blood refinement pill, Lu Ming was full of motivation.</p><p>He continued to move forward along the river.</p><p>Rustle …</p><p>Suddenly, a rustling sound came from a mound beside the river.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he dashed toward the mound.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>There was a cave on the mound, and a few blood ants were going in and out.</p><p>“Could it be an ant nest?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was about to rush out.</p><p>Not far away, the sound of air being torn rang out. Seven figures were rapidly approaching.</p><p>an ant’s nest, it’s an ant’s nest. Haha, we’re so lucky. We’ve only just entered and we’ve already encountered an ant’s nest.</p><p>A burst of laughter rang out.</p><p>“They’re from the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Tianyun!”</p><p>The seven disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect also saw Lu Ming, and their expressions changed.</p><p>good, we’re so lucky. Not only did we encounter an ant nest the moment we entered the blood ant realm, but we also encountered tianyun. As long as we kill him, elder Qiu Wuzhi will reward us handsomely.</p><p>The eyes of the seven young men began to shine.</p><p>“Good luck?”</p><p>The sneer at the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth became more intense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The seven young men moved in a flash and surrounded Lu Ming. Each of them exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>The seven of them were all sixth grade great martial masters, and four of them were even at the peak of the sixth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’re unlucky to have encountered my he clan’s Seven Swords. Today will be the day you die.”</p><p>The oldest young man sneered.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had displayed his powerful combat strength earlier, they were not afraid and were very confident that they could kill him.</p><p>They were quite famous geniuses in the Shifang sword sect. The seven of them came from the same clan and were known as the he clan’s Seven Swords. They were good at joint attacks, and when the seven of them joined forces, not many sixth grade great martial masters could defeat them.</p><p>In the school, other than the six geniuses who had comprehended the control force, no other sixth grade great Martial Master was a match for them.</p><p>Therefore, they were very confident.</p><p>“Shifang Sword School, this time, I’ll start with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>he’s still so arrogant even when he’s about to die. Brothers, send him on his way!</p><p>Clang clang …</p><p>Seven sword hums were heard. Seven people and seven long swords formed an impenetrable net of swords and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>The long spear swept out and collided with the sword net.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. He felt that when the long spear and the sword net collided, the powerful force of the long spear disappeared without a trace, like mud entering the sea.</p><p>He barely managed to push back the sword net, but it didn’t scatter.</p><p>“What a wondrous joint attack technique.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In the last month at the divine Wind Valley, Lu Ming’s cultivation had progressed smoothly and he had broken through to the fifth grade great master realm.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s rich essential Qi and his fifth grade Grandmaster cultivation, a casual sweep of the spear was extremely powerful. An ordinary seventh grade Grandmaster martial artist would be whipped to death.</p><p>Even an eighth grade great Martial Master would be severely injured.</p><p>But it was blocked by the he clan’s Seven Swords.</p><p>“Hahaha! Tianyun, your attacks are useless against us! Prepare to die!”</p><p>One of the he clan’s Seven Swords laughed.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The sword Qi flickered and the dense sword Qi charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and his essential Qi increased by another two points.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This spear attack was even stronger than the previous one.</p><p>It struck the sword net, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>“What’s going on? How can he be so powerful?”</p><p>is this still the strength of a seventh grade great master? ”</p><p>The he clan’s Seven Swords were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Attack with all your might and kill him!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All seven of their bloodlines erupted.</p><p>All of them had fifth-level bloodlines. The power of their bloodlines exploded, greatly increasing their combat power.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The Seven Swords of the he clan roared.</p><p>“Oh, really? You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body erupted with a fiery aura, like a volcano.</p><p>The power of fire!</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
