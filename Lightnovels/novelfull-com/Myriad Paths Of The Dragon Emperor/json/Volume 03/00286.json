Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and four spearlights burst out.</p><p>Pfft! Puu!</p><p>The four demonic beasts were pierced by the Spear’s radiance, turning into energy particles and dissipating.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation, an ordinary third-tier martial arts Grandmaster was no match for him at all. He could easily kill him in one move.</p><p>After the four demonic beasts were killed, Lu Ming walked a dozen meters forward. There was a ball of light with a secret manual floating in it.</p><p>He inhaled the essential Qi and the secret manual fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>The ten swing sword technique, a low Earth grade martial skill.</p><p>Lu Ming flipped it open and was slightly disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming had no use for the swordsmanship.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming had the ancient shield technique and the three Palms. These two martial arts techniques were extremely ancient and were definitely top-tier among the low Earth level martial arts techniques.</p><p>He had not cultivated the divine martial arts technique, Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. It could be said that Lu Ming was not lacking in other martial arts techniques for the time being. What he wanted was a spear technique.</p><p>He was still using the black grade low level martial skill “fire gun technique,” which was completely insufficient.</p><p>However, it was an earth grade martial skill after all. If he couldn’t use it, he could sell it for a shocking price.</p><p>Some of the top geniuses of the large sects naturally did not lack earth level martial arts techniques, but many small sects, and even martial arts grandmasters among the individual cultivators, could not have an earth level martial arts technique at all.</p><p>For an earth grade martial skill, they would be willing to go bankrupt.</p><p>Therefore, the price of an earth level martial skill was at least one million spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the secret manual and continued to move upwards.</p><p>After walking for a hundred meters, there was a flash of light, and another demonic beast appeared.</p><p>This time, it was eight demonic beasts of the early stage of the third level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>It still did not hinder Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Whoosh! Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>Eight spear lights were shot out and eight demonic beasts were killed.</p><p>There was another ball of light in front.</p><p>This time, the ball of light contained a spiritual weapon combat sword. It was a fourth level upper spiritual weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Why were they all related to swords?</p><p>However, since it was a fourth level upper spiritual weapon, its price was not any lower than the ten swing sword technique. Naturally, Lu Ming quickly kept it.</p><p>Then, he continued to move upwards.</p><p>But the next moment, he was slightly stunned, because he saw a short and fat figure.</p><p>It was the chunky young man from the seventh route.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that the eighth path was actually going to merge with the seventh path. They were going to merge into one.</p><p>It was the same for the other paths, where the first and second paths converged.</p><p>The third and fourth converged, and the fifth and sixth converged.</p><p>The two people on two different roads were about to meet.</p><p>In the end, there were only four paths left.</p><p>Obviously, the short and fat young man had also seen Lu Ming. A look of fear flashed in his eyes. His figure flashed repeatedly, wanting to rush up quickly.</p><p>However, at the point where the two paths merged, light flickered and demonic beasts formed one after another.</p><p>There were a total of 16 demonic beasts, and each of them had a stronger aura than the previous ones.</p><p>The 16 demonic beasts were all at the peak of the martial ancestor 3-dan.</p><p>As soon as the 16 demonic beasts appeared, they pounced on the chunky young man. For a moment, the chunky young man was in a tough battle.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over quickly and spearlights burst out.</p><p>The demonic beasts at the peak of the third level of the martial ancestor realm could not put up any resistance and were killed by Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>Soon, only a few of the sixteen demonic beasts were left.</p><p>“Do you want me to do it myself?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the short and fat young man coldly.</p><p>The short and stout youth’s expression was extremely unsightly. Although he was a genius and his cultivation was at the peak of the third grade great Martial Master realm, his combat strength could even fight with an ordinary fourth grade martial ancestor realm martial artist.</p><p>However, it was obvious that Lu Ming was stronger. He was not someone that an ordinary fourth level martial arts Grandmaster could compare to.</p><p>Although the short and stout youth was unwilling, he finally gritted his teeth and turned to leave.</p><p>After all, no matter how precious the treasure was, if he lost his life, everything would be for naught.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his spear and killed the remaining demonic beasts. He then walked toward the third ball of light.</p><p>This time, the ball of light was still a martial technique.</p><p>Lu Ming picked it up and took a look.</p><p>Earth grade high level martial arts technique, hundred steps divine fist.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This time, it was actually an earth level upper level martial arts technique. It was really shocking.</p><p>For a sect like the mystical sword sect, the highest level of martial skills was only earth grade upper level.</p><p>The price was frighteningly high.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it excitedly and then swept his gaze to the other roads.</p><p>The young man on the second path was the unluckiest. As one of the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao Empire, he had met yang Liuji. Without even fighting, he had voluntarily withdrawn.</p><p>In the battle with yang Liuji, he would definitely die.</p><p>Duan Ling easily killed his opponent in the third and fourth path.</p><p>The battle between the fifth and sixth paths was the most intense, causing the others to stop.</p><p>Xie nianqing had a fierce battle with another super rookie of the blood Zhao 50.</p><p>Xie nianqing displayed his terrifying combat power. A seventh level King bloodline was too powerful. The battle between them was extremely intense.</p><p>This was a battle on the level of the six heroes of the scorching sun.</p><p>After exchanging hundreds of blows, Xie nianqing waved his hand and a huge, beautiful woman’s arm appeared out of thin air. She slapped her opponent and sent him flying, causing him to spit out blood.</p><p>Xie nianqing won this battle.</p><p>“This little girl is so powerful. If she goes all out, I might not be able to defeat her. It seems like I have to master the nine Dragons heaven stomping step as soon as possible after I get out of here. I also have to break through to the fifth stage of the true war Dragon technique as soon as possible. Otherwise, my advantage will become less and less obvious compared to the other geniuses.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly and continued to rush upwards.</p><p>After a while, more demonic beasts appeared.</p><p>This time, there were only four of them, but each one of them had a much stronger aura than the previous demonic beasts.</p><p>The four demonic beasts were all in the early stage of the martial ancestor realm Level 4.</p><p>The four demonic beasts roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming fought with his spear. A fourth-tier martial arts Grandmaster could not be killed in one shot. It gave Lu Ming a lot of pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the human path palm. He only used his long spear and the power of wind and Fire to fight.</p><p>He wanted to use this battle to properly comprehend the fusion of Wind and Fire.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the demonic beasts was sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear but it did not dissipate. It roared and charged at him again.</p><p>Just like that, the demonic beasts charged at him one after another, only to be sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s usage of the Wind and Fire forces gradually became more skillful. However, he was still far from being able to integrate them completely.</p><p>After a hundred moves, the four demonic beasts suddenly exploded and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. It seemed that after the continuous attacks, the energy of the four demonic beasts had been exhausted and they had dissipated automatically.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He walked forward and the fourth ball of light appeared.</p><p>There was a Jade box inside. Lu Ming kept it and was overjoyed when he opened it.</p><p>In the jade box, there were actually portions of demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>There were nine points in total. It was written on the jade box that this was the blood essence of a class 6 Level 4 demonic beast.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Nine portions of sixth grade fourth level demonic beast blood essence was a terrifyingly high price. It was equivalent to a sixth grade martial arts Grandmaster. It would be very difficult for the outside world to buy it.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it carefully.</p><p>As they continued to advance, not long after, eight demonic beasts of the early stage of the martial arts Grandmaster 4-dan appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to practice with the spear. After a while, the eight demonic beasts exploded and disappeared.</p><p>This time, the thing that appeared in the ball of light made Lu Weiming a little disappointed.</p><p>It was a low-rank earth cultivation technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
