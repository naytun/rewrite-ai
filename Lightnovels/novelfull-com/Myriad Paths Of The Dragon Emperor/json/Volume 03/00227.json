At a glance, not a single blade of grass grew.</p><p>In the middle of the plain, there was a huge pit with a radius of more than 100 meters. Standing on the edge and looking down, he found that there were densely packed caves in the pit.</p><p>Occasionally, a few blood ants could be seen crawling in and out.</p><p>This was the blood ant nest.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged beside the big pit, waiting for the others to arrive.</p><p>Only three days had passed, and there were still seven days before the closing of the blood ant secret realm.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated while he waited.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.</p><p>During these five days, no one came.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry. He knew that in the first seven to eight days, everyone would be in other places, looking for opportunities and killing blood ants. They would only rush to the blood ant nest in the last two days to try their luck.</p><p>In a swamp, the corpses of blood ants lay there. The blood ant eggs in their abdomens had all disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go to the blood ant nest!”</p><p>A young man with a cold and arrogant expression rushed out of the swamp and towards the blood ant nest with more than a dozen young men behind him.</p><p>A long howl came from a mountain peak.</p><p>“Let’s go to the blood ant nest!”</p><p>Then, dozens of figures leaped in the direction of the blood ant nest.</p><p>In a huge Valley, more than ten students from the general stars Hall were surrounded by more than thirty disciples from the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>“Shifang Sword School, do you really have to be so ruthless?”</p><p>A student from the general Star Hall let out a desperate roar.</p><p>“Nonsense. I’ve already said that I’ll kill anyone who meets your General Star Hall! Kill!”</p><p>There was no suspense at all when the thirty or so young experts of the ten directions Sword School surrounded and killed the ten or so students of the general stars Hall. Not long after, there were a dozen or so more corpses in the valley.</p><p>“Hmph, what Bullsh * t general stars Hall? they’re just a motley crew. It’s a pity that we didn’t encounter that tianyun, or we’d have been able to obtain elder Qiu Wuzhi’s reward.”</p><p>A young man with a majestic figure sneered.</p><p>“Senior brother Gao, tianyun is lucky. If he had met you, he would have been crushed by you within ten moves. I wonder which senior brother has the luck to meet tianyun.”</p><p>that’s right, that’s right. However, from what I can see, that tianyun must have found a place to hide. As long as he can hide until the secret realm closes and rush out at the last moment, he’ll be safe.</p><p>it’s safe. Even if he doesn’t die in the blood ant secret realm, we can still kill him when we get out.</p><p>At the side, the other disciples of the ten directions Sword School started to flatter him.</p><p>Senior brother Gao couldn’t even close his mouth from laughing. After a while, he said, ” alright, that tianyun is pretty capable. Even I would have to spend some effort to deal with him. I’ll need at least a dozen moves. Let’s set off for the blood ant nest now. That’s where the great opportunities lie.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After that, they also headed towards the blood ant nest.</p><p>In a forest, a shocking sword Qi swept across the sky. More than a dozen huge blood ants were cut in half by a single sword Qi.</p><p>Among them, there was even a blood ant of Class 7 Lv 3.</p><p>A figure appeared. It was yang Zaitian.</p><p>His eyes were like lightning, and his aura was terrifying. With a wave of his hand, a large string of blood ant eggs flew into his hand.</p><p>it’s been so many days and I’ve finally made a breakthrough. Now, it’s time to go to the blood ant nest. I’m going to empty it and get a lot of blood refinement pills to accumulate a lot of blood Qi. In the future, I’ll definitely be able to awaken a king class bloodline and trample the six heroes of the scorching sun under my feet.</p><p>Yang Zaitian’s eyes were full of arrogance and confidence.</p><p>Then, in a flash, he headed towards the blood ant nest.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged beside the blood ant nest, suddenly raised his eyebrows and opened his eyes.</p><p>In the distance, more than a dozen figures were rapidly approaching.</p><p>“Finally, someone’s here.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>There were a total of twelve people, and it was obvious that they were disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>In a short while, the twelve of them approached the blood ant nest.</p><p>“What’s that? Tianyun!”</p><p>When the twelve of them saw tianyun, their expressions changed slightly and they stopped.</p><p>They didn’t get close, instead, they were a little afraid.</p><p>There were not many powerful people among them. They had also seen Lu Ming’s combat strength. They were definitely no match for him.</p><p>“Tianyun, so you’ve been hiding here all this time. You really know how to pick a place. No wonder so many of my ten direction Sword School disciples couldn’t find you.”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>“Hiding here?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a faint smile on his face. I guess so. Alright, enough with the nonsense. Now, hand over your storage rings.</p><p>“What? You want us to hand over our storage rings?”</p><p>The twelve disciples of the ten directions Sword School were all stunned.</p><p>“Nonsense, don’t you understand human language? I’m robbing you, hand over your storage rings and you can live. Otherwise, you’ll stay here forever!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>tianyun, How dare you! We’re not looking for trouble with you, and you’re thinking of robbing our storage rings? How dare you!</p><p>The twelve disciples of the ten directions Sword School were in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had been waiting here to Rob them?</p><p>How could he dare to do this?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on them. He made his move immediately. His figure was like a flash of lightning, instantly appearing above the twelve people. With a shake of the demon subduing spear, it turned into twelve spear shadows, blasting at the twelve people.</p><p>“Tianyun, don’t think that we’re afraid of you. Let’s join forces and kill him.”</p><p>The twelve of them roared and attacked together. Twelve attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A loud boom was heard and the ground cracked. The twelve people screamed in pain. Half of their bodies were stuck in the ground. They spat out large mouthfuls of blood and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>Even though there was no one among the twelve who had comprehended force, they were still far superior to ordinary martial artists.</p><p>However, when the twelve of them joined forces, they were as weak as babies in Lu Ming’s hands. They could not resist at all.</p><p>One move and he was already half-dead.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the fifth grade great Martial Master realm, and his true war Dragon technique had broken through to the fourth stage. In addition, the demon subduing spear weighed more than ten thousand pounds. The strength of a casual spear was shocking, and it was not something that ordinary people could block.</p><p>“And now? Are you going to hand over the storage ring or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at the twelve young men from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>“We’ll pay.”</p><p>The twelve young men shouted in succession. They took off the storage rings in their hands and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it with a smile and waved his hand.”Get lost!”</p><p>The twelve of them felt as if they had been granted Amnesty. They struggled to climb out of the ground and fled into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not really want to kill all the disciples of the omnipresent Sword School.</p><p>If it was necessary, he could kill a small portion of them to intimidate them. If he really killed all of the disciples of the ten directions Sword School, the higher-ups of the school would most likely be furious and go crazy, wanting to kill him at all costs.</p><p>This was not what Lu Ming wanted right now. After all, he did not have the ability to fight against the entire omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>After putting away the twelve storage rings, Lu Ming was about to continue sitting cross-legged.</p><p>From another direction, two figures were approaching at high speed.</p><p>“It’s really a waste of effort to find it after searching high and low for it.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>These two people were bai chi and a green-robed young man.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
