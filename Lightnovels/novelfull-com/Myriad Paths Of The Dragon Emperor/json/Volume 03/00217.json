Even the mystical sword sect paled in comparison, let alone the imperial family.</p><p>Therefore, every time the blood ant secret realm opened, most of the blood ant eggs would be taken by the ten direction sword sect, while the royal family would only get a small portion.</p><p>The gale Eagle’s speed was extremely fast, and it only took half a day to cover the distance of twenty thousand li.</p><p>This was a rather desolate wild forest. There were bare rocks everywhere, only a few trees and weeds grew sparsely.</p><p>The gale Eagle landed on a slightly flat area.</p><p>The red-haired old man and the others were the first to jump down.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>“The people from the ten direction Sword School haven’t arrived yet. Let’s wait here for a while.”</p><p>The red-haired old man said.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>At this time, more than a dozen figures jumped high up and onto ten stone pillars on the side.</p><p>He jumped onto the stone pillar and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming could see at a glance that the person on the outermost stone pillar was bai chi.</p><p>“It’s the top ten experts of the outer Palace. Could this be the border-observing pillar?”</p><p>it must be him. But that Baichi still has the face to jump up. Ming Cheng and tianyun are much stronger than him.</p><p>“You’re so thick-skinned!”</p><p>A wave of discussion broke out in the surroundings.</p><p>“The clairvoyant pillar?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“Brother tianyun, there’s actually nothing special about it. It’s just an ordinary stone pillar. It’s just that it’s better to be able to see the mystic realm from above, so it’s called the realm-observing pillar. Every time, only the strongest can ascend it, and it’s a symbol of strength.”</p><p>Ming Cheng explained.</p><p>“Oh? So that’s how it is!” Lu Ming nodded and then looked across. There were more than ten stone pillars but no one had jumped on them.</p><p>that’s the territory reserved by the ten directions Sword School. Those ten or so overlooking pillars belong to the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. No wonder no one jumped on it.</p><p>Then, he looked at the person on the stone pillar.</p><p>These people were the top ten experts of the general Star Hall’s outer hall.</p><p>“Baichi, you’re really shameless. You actually have the face to occupy one of the observing pillars? Get down here immediately!”</p><p>Ming Cheng looked at bai chi and shouted.</p><p>His voice spread far and wide, causing bai Chi’s face to turn red.</p><p>“Ming city!” Bai chi was filled with hatred and gritted his teeth, but he did not come down.</p><p>“Hahaha, Baichi, do you think that you are an expert just because you have it? You’re really shameless. Forget it, I won’t fight with you. If you want it, I’ll give it to you!”</p><p>Ming Cheng waved his hand casually and laughed.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Everyone else in the audience burst into laughter.</p><p>Baichi was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had no interest in such a battle for fame. He shook his head and found a place to sit cross-legged and wait.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a few chirps resounded through the barren mountain.</p><p>Three giant golden birds appeared in the sky.</p><p>The three golden birds spread their wings and covered the sky. They were more than a hundred meters long and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Their wings were golden in color as if they were made of gold. A powerful aura spread out from them, as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>“A martial ancestor realm demonic beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>this is the little golden ROC. It’s said that it has the bloodline of the divine beast, the Golden-winged ROC. The ten direction sword sect actually has such a strange beast, and there are three of them!</p><p>the number one sect of the burning sun Empire is truly terrifying!</p><p>Some of the academies in the general Star Hall cried out in shock.</p><p>CAW!</p><p>The little golden ROC cried out loudly, his voice piercing through the clouds as he descended.</p><p>“Haha, Hua feixiong, you’re early!”</p><p>A burst of laughter came from the little golden ROC in the middle.</p><p>Then, a few old men stepped down from the sky.</p><p>Then, a young man carrying a sword jumped down from the three little golden ROCs.</p><p>There were both men and women among these young men, and all of them had dignified appearances and extraordinary auras. Each of them was like a divine sword, and the sword Qi that came out of their bodies soared into the sky.</p><p>There were more than three hundred and sixty people.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Everyone in the general Star Hall had a change in expression.</p><p>The red-haired old man’s expression was somewhat grave as he said,”I’m just a few minutes early.”</p><p>The leader of the ten direction sword sect was a skinny old man. He glanced at the people in the star Hall and laughed, ” “There seems to be a bit more people this time. Be careful not to let all of them die inside. Otherwise, your general stars Hall will suffer heavy losses after recruiting these people with great difficulty!”</p><p>The red-haired old man’s face was gloomy as he coldly said, ” “Qiu Wuzhi, you don’t have to worry about this matter.”</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? Then let’s go and prepare together!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi laughed coldly.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The red-haired old man waved his hand, and the other two old men followed him, flying into the depths of the barren mountain.</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi and a few elders of the Shifang Sword School also headed into the depths of the mountain.</p><p>He disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Wuwu</p><p>After the elders left, the figures from the ten direction sword sect flashed, and more than a dozen figures jumped up the observing pillar.</p><p>It was obvious that these people were the top experts of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>Although they were all sixth grade great martial masters, the aura they gave off was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Brother tianyun, did you see the person on the first stone pillar?”</p><p>Ming Cheng said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over.</p><p>It was a handsome and cold-looking young man in his early twenties. He was dressed in a white swordsman’s robe and carried a huge sword that was as wide as a palm on his back.</p><p>He was just sitting there casually, but he gave off an extremely dangerous aura. Yes, even Lu Ming felt threatened.</p><p>“Is this person very famous?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>his name is yang Zaitian, a terrifying peerless genius of the ten directions Sword School. He ranked first on the bronze ranking when he was only in the master realm. He successfully comprehended the control force when he was in the ninth grade master realm and killed many Grandmaster realm experts when he was in the ninth grade master realm. You must be careful when you meet him!</p><p>Ming Cheng’s expression was extremely serious.</p><p>There were very few people who could make Ming city so serious.</p><p>the first place on the bronze ranking of the omnidirectional sword sect? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>As the number one sect in the burning sun Empire, the ten direction sword sect was ranked first on the bronze ranking, which was no small matter.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Of course, other than this person, there are a few other extremely terrifying people in the ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>Ming Cheng said.</p><p>“Hahaha, there are quite a lot of people from the general stars Hall this time. Three years ago, there were less than a hundred people, but this time, there are actually a hundred and twenty people.”</p><p>At this moment, an ear-piercing sound rang out in the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>“Junior Brother, you’re wrong. What do you mean by 120 people? in my opinion, it’s just 120 pieces of trash!”</p><p>Another voice followed.</p><p>hahaha, senior brother is right. It’s 120 pieces of trash. That’s right!</p><p>“You’re absolutely correct!”</p><p>The people from the ten direction sword sect immediately burst into laughter.</p><p>“What did you say? Who’s the good-for-nothing?”</p><p>Someone in the general Star Hall was furious and shouted.</p><p>“Aiyo, you’re angry? am I not right? Three years ago, ninety-eight people entered the general Star Hall, and only twenty-three came out. What are they if not trash?”</p><p>A crooked-mouthed young man from the ten directions sword sect walked out and looked coldly at the people from the general Star Hall.</p><p>“This time, you have more than 120 people. Don’t all die in there!”</p><p>The crooked mouth young man continued to sneer.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
