However, Lu Ming’s words really made them unable to hold back.</p><p>Especially Ming Feng, he laughed until tears flowed out.</p><p>Even the other disciples of the ten directions Sword School couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>Wu kui’s face turned the color of a pig’s liver and his eyes turned red. He was so angry that his entire body trembled.”Bastard, die!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wu kui threw a punch at Lu Ming. The force of his fist condensed into a mountain and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He did not back down and threw a punch as well.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist smashed into the mountain that Wu kui had sent out. A shocking scene unfolded. The mountain rumbled and exploded under Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Wu kui retreated seven to eight steps and his fist was trembling non-stop.</p><p>The people around them gasped.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming had managed to force Wu kui back with one punch?</p><p>The strength that Wu kui had just displayed was shocking. He suppressed many of the mystical sword sect’s experts and was practically an invincible existence in the martial Grandmaster realm. Yet, he was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s punch?</p><p>A few months ago, Lu Ming had displayed extremely powerful combat abilities at the DI Tian battle arena. He had been able to cross two levels and obtain ten consecutive victories, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, he was only a sixth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>As for Wu kui, he was a peak ninth grade great Martial Master and a peerless genius.</p><p>Before this punch, no one had thought that Lu Ming could fight Wu kui. However, the truth was beyond their expectations.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Wu kui roared. His aura became even more terrifying like an enraged Lion.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? You’re too weak. Don’t there still have a few people stronger than you in the ten direction Sword School? I don’t have that much time to play with you. If you want to attack, then hurry up and attack together.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the other disciples of the omnidirectional Sword School as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>“What? What?”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions sword sect were stunned.</p><p>The surrounding audience was also stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge all the experts of the omnidirectional Sword School. Was he crazy?</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi’s eyes glowed as she stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>this young man is quite strong, but he’s underestimating the geniuses of the ten direction Sword School!</p><p>A gold-robed elder shook his head and said.</p><p>I’m not looking down on the geniuses of the ten direction Sword School. It’s just that this young man is confident.</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>“You have the confidence? Did the sect leader mean that this little guy could challenge all the experts of the ten direction Sword School and win? How was this possible? Even Qiu changkong wasn’t this strong when he was a martial Grandmaster.”</p><p>The Golden-robed elder said.</p><p>“We haven’t fought yet, who knows?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi revealed a faint smile.</p><p>The other gold-robed elders were bewildered.</p><p>“Arrogant, too arrogant.”</p><p>“He’s looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School roared.</p><p>“Tianyun, since you’re so confident, don’t blame us for winning with numbers. Let’s attack together.”</p><p>A heroic-looking young man said coldly. He took a step forward and appeared beside Lu Ming, forming a triangle with Wu kui.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a shocking aura burst out from the young man’s body. Then, a bloodline in the shape of a saber appeared.</p><p>Without a doubt, it was also a special bloodline.</p><p>As soon as the bloodline was released, a shocking saber radiance shot into the sky. Its aura was even more terrifying than Wu kui’s.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, with a flash, four more figures appeared around Lu Ming, surrounding him.</p><p>The four of them all had bloodlines floating above their heads. Two of them had special bloodlines, while the other two didn’t have special bloodlines, but they were still extremely powerful.</p><p>Every single one of them had a terrifyingly powerful aura. Each one of them was stronger than Wu kui.</p><p>The faces of the mystical sword sect geniuses with special bloodlines were pale, and their eyes were filled with dejection.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers also widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>When Wu kui said that there were five people in the ten direction sword sect who were stronger than him, many people did not believe him and thought that he was trying to elevate the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>However, they now knew that Wu kui was telling the truth.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect really had five geniuses who were stronger than Wu kui.</p><p>This was too shocking. Countless people were shocked by the power of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>one of such geniuses is enough to sweep away geniuses of the same level, let alone six!</p><p>tianyun is finished. He will definitely die Here today. What a pity for a genius. Given time, he will definitely not be any weaker than the six heroes!</p><p>Everyone sighed.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>At this moment, the six peerless geniuses attacked together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Six different attacks were launched at Lu Ming from different directions.</p><p>Every single one of them was extremely terrifying. Every single one of them had the power of a 1-stage martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The martial Grandmaster and the martial Grandmaster were two completely different realms. The difference was like the difference between heaven and earth.</p><p>Very few people in the great Martial Master realm had the combat power to fight against a 1-dan martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Right now, the six people from the ten direction Sword School were almost at the 1-stage martial arts Grandmaster realm. One could imagine how terrifying they were.</p><p>“Wind, fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. He clenched his right hand in the air and a long spear was formed. Wind and Fire were integrated into the long spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming bent his legs slightly and exerted all his strength. The ground under his feet exploded and a huge hole appeared. The floor cracked like a spider web. Lu Ming’s body shot up into the sky like a cannonball. He thrust the long spear upwards, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear created a huge hole in the joint attack of the six of them. Lu Ming soared straight up into the sky.</p><p>“Charge and surround him!”</p><p>A genius from the ten directions Sword School shouted. Then, six figures shot up from the ground and flew hundreds of meters into the air.</p><p>“Human Dao palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and struck his palm down.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The spirit Qi between heaven and earth surged wildly and gathered towards Lu Ming. A huge palm print appeared in the air. The lines on the palm were clear as if it was real.</p><p>The huge palm print slammed down. The air exploded wherever the palm print passed. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Not good, let’s join forces to resist!”</p><p>The expressions of the six people from the ten directions Sword School changed drastically, and they let out a horrified roar. The six of them used all their strength, and suddenly, six terrifying attacks gathered together and blasted toward the huge palm print.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palm print collided with the attacks of the six people, and the force swept out, forming a terrible shock wave that rushed in all directions.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Below, the crowd’s expressions changed drastically, and they scattered in all directions. Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ground was swept up by the force, and huge pits were blasted out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, with a deafening sound, the combined attack of the six people from the ten directions Sword School was shattered by the palm print. The palm print didn’t stop and continued to press down.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Wu kui roared.</p><p>The six geniuses from the ten direction Sword School wanted to escape, but they were already enveloped by the human Dao palm, so it was difficult for them to escape.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
