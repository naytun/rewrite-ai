A powerful aura burst out but was quickly retracted.</p><p>Ninth grade great master realm, breakthrough!</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing’s eyes widened in shock. He actually broke through just like that?</p><p>To be honest, when she first saw Lu Ming, she was extremely shocked because Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was too fast.</p><p>Back in the Dongyi tribe’s ancestral secret land, Lu Ming’s cultivation was one grade lower than hers. He was only a second grade Grandmaster.</p><p>It had only been half a year or so and Lu Ming’s cultivation had increased to a terrifying level. If not for her fortuitous encounter, she would have been overtaken by Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had a breakthrough again!</p><p>She did not know how amazing Lu Ming’s spirit-devouring bloodline was and was naturally shocked.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, got up, and walked forward.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s beautiful eyes were fixed on Lu Ming, as if he wanted to see through him.</p><p>The two of them headed towards the depths of the desolate wilderness.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming used the thousand-mile sound transmission talisman to send a voice transmission to the experts of the royal family. He received a response very quickly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not meet up with the imperial family’s experts. Instead, they split up.</p><p>They were too big of a target when they gathered together.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, in the depths of the desolate wilderness, in a certain wild forest.</p><p>The light moved and a dozen figures in black robes appeared.</p><p>There were a few old men and a few middle-aged men.</p><p>Among them, there was only a young man in his twenties.</p><p>However, the young man seemed to be the leader of the group.</p><p>damn it, the people from the ten direction sword sect are really persistent. They’re like a dog that won’t let go!</p><p>A middle-aged man said unhappily.</p><p>“Hmph, if we didn’t have this cripple with us, how could the ten direction Sword School catch up to us?”</p><p>The other man with a scar on his face said coldly as he looked at the other man.</p><p>This person had a head of messy hair that reached his waist. His face was covered with a beard that drooped to his chest. His hair and beard were like a bird’s nest, and he had not washed them for a long time.</p><p>He was casually wearing a worn-out shirt that was covered in blood.</p><p>His eyes were empty, staring at the sky in a daze, and he didn’t pay any attention to the man with the knife scar.</p><p>Seeing this, the knife-scarred man’s eyes flashed with killing intent and he shouted in a low voice, ” “Lu Yuntian, don’t play the fool in front of us. Hand over the Martial Emperor’s Secret key and tell us the whereabouts of the Martial Emperor’s treasure. Otherwise, I’ll kill you with a single slash.”</p><p>This dirty and messy man was actually Lu Yuntian, Lu Ming’s father who had disappeared for more than eight years.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yuntian’s eyes flickered as if he had come back to his senses. He looked at the knife-scarred man with a disdainful expression and said, ” “Alright, then quickly kill me!”</p><p>“You think I don’t dare to? Damn it, when we return to the yin Yue Empire, I’ll make you suffer. Let’s see if you’ll say it or not.”</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared.</p><p>“I’ve been in the ten direction Sword School for more than eight years. What kind of tricks have I not experienced? I didn’t even say anything. Do you think you can do it?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s disdain grew.</p><p>“Damn you, referee!</p><p>The scar-faced man was so angry that his facial muscles trembled, causing the scar on his face to tremble.</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to kill Lu Yuntian. However, Lu Yuntian had too many secrets in his heart that they had to know.</p><p>They had taken the risk to kidnap Lu Yuntian for those secrets.</p><p>alright, we’ll investigate it when we get back. The most important thing now is how to get rid of the ten direction sword sect and Qiu changkong’s pursuit.</p><p>A white-haired old man waved his hand and said.</p><p>The scar-faced man smiled at Lu Yuntian sinisterly and did not say anything else.</p><p>“So what if we catch up? I’d like to have a battle with Qiu changkong. I’d like to see how Qiu changkong is qualified to be on the cloud Emperor board.”</p><p>The only young man sneered.</p><p>“Third Prince, don’t be careless. The Yun Emperor list is the list of the strongest among the younger generation in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. There are only 36 people on it. Qiu changkong is ranked 36th, which means his strength is absolutely terrifying. We can’t underestimate him.”</p><p>The white-haired old man warned.</p><p>However, the young man just smiled, apparently not too concerned.</p><p>“Let’s hurry and leave this place.”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Leave? Can you get a divorce now?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout came from the sky.</p><p>A beam of rainbow light took the lead and rushed over, followed by six other beams of rainbow light.</p><p>The white-haired old man’s expression changed and he shouted in horror, ” “Qiu changkong, this is bad. Let’s go!”</p><p>“No one can leave!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the rainbow light in front of him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An incomparably bright sword light flew out, slashing towards the people of the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, I’ll fight you.”</p><p>The third Prince of the Dark Moon Empire let out a long roar. With a wave of his hand, a round-shaped weapon, which looked like a bright moon, appeared.</p><p>The wheel turned and slashed out a terrifying sharp light toward the sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, a 100-meter-long ditch appeared on the ground as the two men’s attacks swept across.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space moved, and a tall and slender figure appeared in the air.</p><p>He was about 25 or 26 years old, with a cold and handsome face, like a sharp sword. His long swordsman robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p>This was Qiu changkong, the leader of the scorching sun’s six heroes. He was a famous genius in the entire Cloud King Mountain range and was ranked on the Cloud King List.</p><p>“Yin jiuyou, so it’s you guys.”</p><p>Qiu changkong said as he swept his gaze across the crowd.</p><p>haha, Qiu changkong, you’re trying to take all the good fortune for yourself? I, Yin jiuyou, will not allow that.</p><p>The third Prince of the yin Yue Empire, Yin jiuyou, laughed.</p><p>“Anyone who dares to touch my things can only die!”</p><p>As soon as the word ” die ” was uttered, Qiu changkong made his move. A beam of crystal-clear sword Qi soared into the sky. His entire body merged with the sword Qi as he charged toward Yin jiuyou.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, I’d like to see how you managed to get into the cloud Emperor board today.”</p><p>Yin jiuyou let out a long howl as he engaged Qiu changkong in battle.</p><p>The two of them were much stronger than Feng Wuji and the others, and their battle shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought in the sky, like two streams of light constantly exchanging blows. In the blink of an eye, their battle had reached the depths of the desolate wilderness and they disappeared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the martial grandmasters of the ten direction Sword School had also arrived and were charging towards the people of the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Soon, the great Martial Master of the ten directions sword sect arrived, making the scene even more chaotic.</p><p>“Be careful, don’t kill Lu Yuntian!”</p><p>An elder of the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>The purpose of the great battle between the two parties was to fight for Lu Yuntian. Therefore, they avoided Lu Yuntian during the battle, afraid that they would kill him by mistake and all their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>The battle between the two parties was extremely intense, but Lu Yuntian was left to the side.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were traveling at full speed.</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them heard a violent explosion in front of them.</p><p>“There’s a huge battle. Could it be that the people from the ten direction Sword School have already caught up to my father? Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly and he ran towards the battlefield at top speed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
