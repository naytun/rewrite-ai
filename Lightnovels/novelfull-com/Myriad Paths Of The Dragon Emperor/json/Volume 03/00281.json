Zhao Hong shouted coldly as he slashed out with his blade. A sharp blade light slashed towards the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The knife light and the nail collided, making a sound of metal clashing and sparks flying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A figure flew far away. It was Zhao Hong.</p><p>He was no match for the Golden-eyed blood zombie and was sent flying by its claw.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and continued to chase after Zhao Hong. Its speed was as fast as lightning.</p><p>Zhao Hong’s expression was extremely unsightly. Blood was flowing out of the corner of his mouth. He had been injured by that move just now.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden-eyed blood zombie pounced on him. He did not dare to continue fighting. He turned and ran. The direction he ran in was the direction of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He and Xie nianqing turned around and ran.</p><p>“You two still dare to run? Stop quickly and help me stall this blood corpse. If you die in the hands of a blood corpse, you’ll die a happy death, but if you fall into my hands, I’ll make you beg for death.”</p><p>Zhao Hong shouted coldly in an overbearing manner.</p><p>what do you mean by ‘one of the 50 super rookies of the blood Zhao Empire’? I think he’s a complete idiot. Little Qing, what do you think? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a disdainful tone.</p><p>Xie nianqing stumbled and almost fell. What did Lu Ming just call her? Little Qing?</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes glowed viciously as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little Qing, is that guy an idiot?”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended not to know and continued to ask.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and only managed to spit out one word after a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming was clearly taking advantage of her.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Zhao Hong bellowed and was about to release his essential Qi to slash at Lu Ming. However, his speed slowed down as he gathered his essential Qi. The Golden-eyed blood zombie caught up and slashed at him.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Even though Zhao Hong had escaped quickly, a piece of cloth was still caught. The piece of cloth that was caught happened to be on Zhao Hong’s butt. Immediately, half of Zhao Hong’s snow-white butt was exposed.</p><p>ah! Zhao Hong screamed and jumped forward as if he had been electrocuted. Only then did he escape the danger of being torn apart by the claw. However, the next moment, he felt a chill on his butt. He turned his head and roared.</p><p>hey, why is that guy running in such a strange way? he keeps looking at his butt. Is he sick? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sharp. He noticed Zhao Hong’s strange behavior and muttered.</p><p>Zhao Hong’s face was flushed red. His killing intent towards Lu Ming was so strong that it could not be dispersed.</p><p>He frantically chased after Lu Ming and the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Zhao Hong’s speed was extremely fast and he was about to catch up to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>hahaha, go to hell, kid. With a beauty accompanying you, you won’t be lonely on the road to hell.</p><p>Zhao Hong sneered. His essential Qi burst forth and he increased his speed to the maximum. He flew over the heads of Lu Ming and su lingyue arrogantly.</p><p>Behind them, the Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and glared at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing with murderous intent.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly felt that the demon suppressing seal given to him by the nine suns Supreme was glowing faintly.</p><p>“Could it be that after the demon suppressing token subdued the blood demon, it still has the energy to subdue this golden-eyed blood corpse?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>“I don’t care, I’ll give it a try!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stopped in his tracks. The demon suppressing token had unknowingly appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why did you stop?”</p><p>Xie nianqing was shocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only smiled at her and did not explain.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming. You can’t die before I trample you under my feet.”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and stopped as well. He stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, these two B * stards are probably scared silly.”</p><p>Zhao Hong Ran madly and only stopped when he was ten miles away. He stood high in the sky and looked from afar.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie roared angrily and was about to grab Lu Ming with its claws.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The demon suppressing token in Lu Ming’s hand glowed and an invisible wave rushed toward the Golden-eyed blood corpse. At the same time, Lu Ming shouted in his heart and turned into an invisible wave that rushed into the body of the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>All of this happened in silence. Even Xie nianqing, who was standing beside him, didn’t notice it.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing’s body was already covered in Black Lotus flowers. His true Qi was at its maximum, ready to fight to the death.</p><p>But suddenly, the Golden-eyed blood corpse stopped and let out a low roar. It didn’t continue to attack.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave another order in his heart. The next moment, the Golden-eyed blood corpse growled in a low voice. It turned around and ran back. Then, it jumped into the pit and disappeared.</p><p>Xie nianqing was dumbfounded. His eyes widened and he said, ” “This … What’s going on?”</p><p>“Hahaha, little Qing, can’t you tell? I, Lu Ming, am blessed by the heavens. What golden-eyed blood corpse, if it doesn’t run away obediently when it sees me, it won’t dare to attack me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed maniacally, looking like a smug and narcissistic person.</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at him with disdain. He did not believe Lu Ming’s nonsense at all.</p><p>Then, he gritted his teeth and said, ” “Lu Ming, I’m warning you. Don’t call me Xiaoqing.”</p><p>“Alright, little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth. He wanted to bite Lu Ming.</p><p>In the distant sky, Zhao Hong was also dumbfounded.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why didn’t the Golden-eyed blood corpse attack those two?”</p><p>Zhao Hong’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“Does it mean that the Golden-eyed blood corpse won’t attack if I admit defeat?”</p><p>Zhao Hong’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>However, he didn’t dare to move forward for a while. The Golden-eyed blood corpse was too strong. In a head-on battle, he would be killed in a few moves.</p><p>In the Stone Forest, Lu Ming glanced at Zhao Hong who was in the distance. He sneered and said to Xie nianqing, ” let’s go. There are still so many blood refining crystals left. Let’s take them all.</p><p>“You’re still going? Aren’t you afraid of the Golden-eyed blood corpse …”</p><p>Xie nianqing hesitated.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? I told you, I’m protected by the heavens. When the Golden-eyed blood corpse sees me, it can’t wait to run away. It won’t dare to attack me. Don’t worry, I’m here, it’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of nonsense and he strode forward proudly.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>When the two of them arrived at the pit, the Golden-eyed blood corpse was still motionless.</p><p>There was a smile on Lu Ming’s face. He was not worried at all. He jumped into the pit and started to collect the blood refining crystals.</p><p>Seeing this, Xie nianqing also felt relieved. For some reason, he suddenly believed Lu Ming’s words a little.</p><p>“Bah, how is that possible? This guy is full of lies.”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head and began to collect blood refining crystals.</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m really fine!”</p><p>In the distance, Zhao Hong’s mouth was so wide open that a goose egg could be stuffed in it when he saw this scene.</p><p>“Should I go over there and kill those two and take the blood refining crystals? no, I’m a genius with a bright future. How can I take risks so easily? I’ll wait until those two guys have collected all the blood refining crystals and come out. Then, I’ll kill them and the blood refining crystals will be mine.”</p><p>Zhao Hong calculated and was no longer in a hurry. He waited in the air.</p><p>“Collect, collect, collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were extremely excited.</p><p>A moment later, the two of them had collected more than 3000 blood refining crystals each. At this time, the blood refining crystals in the pit were finally finished.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
