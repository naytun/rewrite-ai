I can recognize him even if he’s turned to dust.” Hua Jie said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Heh, young prince, how do you want me to teach him a lesson? whatever you want him to become, I’ll make him become!”</p><p>Chen Xiong took a few steps forward and looked at Lu Ming teasingly.</p><p>do as you see fit. First, break his arms and legs. As for the rest, do as you wish!</p><p>Hua Jie said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll beat him up so badly that even his mother won’t be able to recognize him.”</p><p>Chen Xiong sneered, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Peak fourth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He was only a peak fourth grade great Martial Master and yet he dared to be so arrogant.</p><p>“Chen Xiong, this is the general Star Hall. Don’t act rashly!”</p><p>Mingzhu’s expression was grave as she took a step forward.</p><p>“Aiyo, isn’t this the Pearl Beauty? What, you want to help him? But do you think you can stop me? get lost immediately and don’t ask for trouble.”</p><p>Chen Xiong berated.</p><p>Mingzhu’s expression changed, becoming extremely unsightly.</p><p>“What are you so arrogant for? At worst, we’ll just have a battle!”</p><p>Ming Feng saw that Mingzhu was being bullied and immediately shouted.</p><p>“You’re just a kid whose hair hasn’t even fully grown yet. You’re like an ant, and you want to fight me? I’ll cripple you right now.”</p><p>Chen Xiong laughed coldly and walked towards Ming Feng.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and took a step forward. His eyes were calm and a powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>The aura of a fourth grade great Martial Master!</p><p>“So you’re a fourth grade great Martial Master. No wonder you could defeat six of the young Prince’s top experts and be so arrogant. But do you think that you can fight me just because you’re a fourth grade great Martial Master? I’ll let you understand how naïve you are.”</p><p>Chen Xiong’s eyes flickered as he spoke in a contemptuous manner.</p><p>“Then you can try!” Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their auras clashed, and a gust of wind swept up.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? You’re not allowed to use force at the entrance of the general Star Hall, all of you, leave!”</p><p>Suddenly, at the entrance of the general Star Hall, the old man in charge of registration let out an angry roar.</p><p>An extremely powerful aura burst out and enveloped the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze changed. This old man was definitely a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>“Elder, this person has a grudge against me. I’ll cripple him and leave immediately!”</p><p>Hua Jie cupped his fists at the old man.</p><p>“Young prince, although you have a noble status, this is the general Star Hall, and the general Star Hall has its own rules. Other than His Majesty, no one can break the rules of the general Star Hall, and you are no exception!”</p><p>The old man cupped his fists slightly, but he had no intention of giving in.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Hua Jie’s expression was ugly, but he was helpless.</p><p>The general stars Hall’s elders were directly under the Emperor. Even if his father, the heavenly suppression King, were here, the general stars Hall’s elders might not give him any face.</p><p>Hmph, kid, you’re lucky, but your luck will last for three days at most. I’ll see how you die in three days!</p><p>Hua Jie said as he looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After that, Hua Jie waved his hand and strode into the general Star Hall.</p><p>Chen Xiong cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. He sneered and followed Hua Jie.</p><p>“Alright! Continue!”</p><p>The old man waved his hand and said.</p><p>There were not many people in the first place. Very soon, it was Ming Feng’s turn. After Ming Feng, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>“Condense your bloodline and let me see!”</p><p>The old man cast a nonchalant glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, a sanguine light flashed on his body and his spirit-devouring bloodline was condensed. At the same time, six blood-colored chakra shone.</p><p>sixth level Blood Meridian!</p><p>The old man’s eyes suddenly burst with intense light, like two suns.</p><p>At the side, Mingzhu, Ming Feng, and some other people also looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>A sixth level Blood Meridian, it was actually a sixth level Blood Meridian.</p><p>One must know that in the five great sects, those with sixth level bloodlines were all considered top geniuses, and they were people at the level of the newcomer King.</p><p>At most, there would be one or two in a year, or even none.</p><p>The old man’s eyes flickered and he suddenly asked, ” “Which of the five great sects are you a disciple of?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He smiled bitterly in his heart. It seemed that the level of the blood Meridian was too high and it had aroused the suspicion of the elder.</p><p>However, he could not control the appearance of the chakra of his bloodline. Otherwise, he could only display three chakras in a low-key way.</p><p>“Junior doesn’t belong to any of the five great sects. I’m just a rogue cultivator.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>He wasn’t lying. He was indeed a wandering cultivator now.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes flickered, clearly not believing it.</p><p>“What’s your name?” The old man asked.</p><p>“Tianyun!” Lu Ming answered.</p><p>Then, the old man took out a Jade token and carved a few inscriptions on it.</p><p>“There’s a test at the martial arts field in three days!” He passed the Jade token to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade card and nodded.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, which room are you staying in?”</p><p>After Lu Ming had registered, Ming Feng came up to him and asked.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Jade card and channeled essential Qi into it. Some information immediately appeared.</p><p>outer hall, No. 11232!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, then let’s be together. My outer Palace number is 11231, and my sister is not far from us. She’s in number 11186.”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, but his heart was moved.</p><p>Every martial artist had their own room. There were more than ten thousand of them. It seemed like there were quite a number of people in the general Star Hall. There were at least ten thousand people.</p><p>However, it was normal when he thought about it. The general stars Hall recruited a batch of people every month. Even if there were not many each time, the number of people accumulated over the years was not small.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful in three days!”</p><p>At this moment, Mingzhu warned with a grave expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. The old man told everyone who joined that there would be a test in the martial arts school field three days later.</p><p>Moreover, Hua Jie had said that Lu Ming was lucky and only had three days. He would see how Lu Ming died three days later!</p><p>He was very curious about this.</p><p>“What’s going on with the test in three days?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Mingzhu pondered for a moment and said, ” brother Tian, you should know that the general stars Hall recruits people without asking about their background or origin. They take in anyone. There must be a mix of good and bad people here.</p><p>“Of course, the general Star Hall will take some measures. Therefore, the students who have just joined the general Star Hall will have a test in three days.”</p><p>the test is actually very simple. It’ll be a sparring match between the senior students and the new students. On the surface, it’s a sparring match, but in reality, it’s to test the new students ‘abilities. If they’re disciples of the five great sects, then they definitely won’t receive any training in the future.</p><p>Mingzhu explained in detail.</p><p>So that was how it was!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>In that case, three days later, Hua Jie and the others were planning to tamper with the test.</p><p>so, brother Tian, you must be careful in three days. By right, the senior students who will participate in the test will be selected by the elders of the general Star Hall. However, with Hua Jie’s abilities, it should not be difficult for him to do something.</p><p>Mingzhu continued.</p><p>“If they want to come, then let them come!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not care.</p><p>brother Tian, don’t be careless. Chen Xiong is a top genius. Although his cultivation is at the peak of the fourth grade great Martial Master realm, he once had a record of killing a fifth grade great Martial Master with a single strike. He’s extremely powerful, and ordinary martial artists can’t compare to him at all.</p><p>Mingzhu continued.</p><p>“Genius? Wouldn’t that be even more interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming was still smiling faintly.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Mingzhu did not say much. She led Lu Ming and Ming Feng to the dormitory.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
