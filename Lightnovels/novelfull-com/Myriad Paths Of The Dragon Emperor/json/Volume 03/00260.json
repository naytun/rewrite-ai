They heavily hit the ground, creating six large pits and sending smoke and dust into the air.</p><p>In the distance, countless people watched this scene in a daze. Time seemed to have frozen at this moment. They even forgot to breathe. They could only stare with wide eyes, as if they wanted to engrave this scene in their hearts forever.</p><p>It was simply too shocking.</p><p>Any one of the six peerless geniuses of the ten direction Sword School could defeat almost all the great martial masters in the burning sun Empire.</p><p>However, the six of them had joined forces but were defeated by Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>Even a fool could see the difference.</p><p>The remaining three mystical sword sect geniuses with special bloodlines stared at Lu Ming in disbelief, as if they could not believe that such a genius existed in the world. Then, the dejection in their eyes deepened.</p><p>Before they came to the Imperial City, they were proud and arrogant, high and mighty. They thought that they had special bloodlines, that they were the darlings of heaven and earth, and looked down on martial artists with ordinary bloodlines.</p><p>They believed that there was no one stronger than them in a battle of the same level.</p><p>However, not long after he arrived at the imperial capital, he received a fatal blow.</p><p>They were no match for Wu kui, who had defeated them all.</p><p>However, such an opponent whom they looked up to and five geniuses who were more powerful than Wu kui had been defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>This simply subverted their understanding of the world.</p><p>The blow to them was too great.</p><p>sigh, in the past, we dominated the mystical sword sect and thought that we were invincible. It turns out that we’ve been sitting on the fence all this time.</p><p>The only woman among the three sighed softly.</p><p>The other two’s eyes flickered, and then they sighed.</p><p>There would always be someone better, and there would always be someone better. They only truly understood this truth today.</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi and the few gold-robed elders were also dumbfounded.</p><p>amazing, truly amazing. The general stars Hall actually has such a genius. Looking at his age, he should be in his twenties, right? ”</p><p>A gold-robed elder sighed with envy.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming’s actual age was not even eighteen years old. He only looked like he was in his twenties because he was wearing a disguise or mask.</p><p>the second level of the earth level palm technique, the force of fire is at the advanced level, the force of wind is at the initial level, and his Zhen Qi is extremely strong. Genius, a real genius.</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s eyes sparkled. Even though he had thought highly of Lu Ming, he was still sighing.</p><p>big brother tianyun is mighty! Big brother tianyun is invincible!</p><p>Ming Feng reacted and shouted in excitement.</p><p>When the dust settled, everyone saw six big pits on the ground. The six geniuses from the ten directions Sword School were lying in the pits, motionless and covered in blood.</p><p>Although he was still breathing and not dead, many of his bones had been broken. Without a month or two of recuperation, he would not be able to recover.</p><p>“What genius? You’re nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Wu kui and the rest indifferently.</p><p>Wu kui and the others were so angry that they almost spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>If they weren’t so badly injured, they would have shouted out loud.</p><p>He was angry and regretful.</p><p>During this period of time, they had swept across the mystical sword sect, boosted the morale of many geniuses from the star temple and the Crimson Cloud Valley, and pushed the reputation of the ten direction sword sect to the peak.</p><p>But now, the six of them were defeated by Lu Ming with one palm. It would be a joke if this news spread.</p><p>It would definitely be a huge blow to the reputation of the omnidirectional Sword School. All their hard work during this period of time had been reduced to nothing by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“Haha, good!” In the sky, a golden-robed elder laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Wu kui and the rest. He did not attack again and turned to leave in big strides.</p><p>Ming Cheng and the others quickly followed.</p><p>Countless gazes followed Lu Ming’s movements, watching his back as he left.</p><p>It was a proud, determined, and unyielding back.</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi looked at Lu Ming’s back and was shocked.</p><p>In his eyes, the back of tianyun and the back of another young man were extremely similar.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi muttered, her eyes shining. After a long time, she sighed.</p><p>This long sigh contained a trace of regret.</p><p>perhaps, I made the wrong choice! Lin Xueyi sighed in her heart.</p><p>……</p><p>General stars Hall, Lu Ming’s room.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the bed.</p><p>I’m very close to the ninth grade Grandmaster realm now. I need to break through as soon as possible so that I can refine the blood refinement pill and improve the foundation of my second bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>Before the emperor’s birthday, Lu Ming would be in seclusion in the earth cave for three months.</p><p>A month ago, he had refined 100 demonic cores and his cultivation had reached the peak seventh grade great master realm.</p><p>In the next two months, he successfully broke through and reached the eighth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>In the past month, he had refined another 100 ninth grade third level demonic cores, and his cultivation had successfully entered the peak of eighth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>With his current cultivation base, the three path palm that had already reached the second level, and the force of fire that had broken through to the phenomenal success stage, it was normal for him to defeat Wu kui and the others with one palm.</p><p>He did not care about defeating Wu kui and the others at all. In his opinion, it was an insignificant matter. His current goal was to break through to the ninth grade great Martial Master realm as soon as possible and then attempt to break through to the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately began to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three hours had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>That was because he felt a terrifying killing intent engulfing him. At the same time, he felt a sense of extreme danger, causing his heart to tremble and his hair to stand on end.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>There was no time to think. Without any hesitation, Lu Ming soared into the sky and rushed to the ceiling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying air-piercing sound was heard. A hundred-meter long, extremely bright sword light slashed toward Lu Ming’s dormitory.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s dormitory, as well as the other rooms in front, back, up, down, and above, suddenly exploded. Broken stones and wood shavings flew in all directions.</p><p>The entire building was split in half.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky from the broken pieces of wood.</p><p>“Tianyun, die!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming saw two young men in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the yellow-robed young men swung his sword and another terrifying sword radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The speed of the sword light was unbelievably fast and it arrived in front of Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. In front of him, four ancient shields were formed.</p><p>The four shields were stacked in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword light struck the shield, causing it to shake violently. Then, the first shield exploded, followed by the second, the third …</p><p>In just a breath’s time, the four shields were all shattered.</p><p>However, within a breath’s time, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian erupted and a powerful devouring force spread throughout his body. At the same time, he retreated frantically and took out the demon subduing spear to block in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword gleam slashed at the demon subduing spear. Lu Ming’s entire body trembled as if he had been hit by a huge mountain. His body was like a cannonball as he crashed to the ground.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
