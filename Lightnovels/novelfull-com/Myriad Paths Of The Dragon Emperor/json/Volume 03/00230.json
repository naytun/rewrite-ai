He deserves to die a thousand times. He’s the person that elder Qiu Wuzhi wants to kill. Let’s attack together and kill him.</p><p>The tall and thin youth waved his hand and shouted.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together.”</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions Sword School shouted. More than two hundred people unsheathed their swords, and terrifying sword Qi gathered together, stirring up the wind and clouds. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The ground made a series of cracking sounds as sword marks appeared.</p><p>In the distance, the faces of the people from the general stars Hall changed drastically. The combined force of nearly two hundred disciples of the ten directions Sword School was too astonishing. Even a ninth grade great Martial Master would have to retreat.</p><p>“Tianyun is too arrogant. He’s just reaping what he’s sown.”</p><p>Someone in the general Star Hall said.</p><p>“Brother tianyun!”</p><p>Ming Cheng roared, very worried.</p><p>hahaha, if you want to attack, then attack. Stop talking so much nonsense. Let me see if the ten direction Sword School is a bunch of trash.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Attack and kill him.”</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Instantly, more than fifty sword Qi beams shot up into the sky and slashed at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>More than fifty sword auras completely enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was calm and the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed. His body exuded a sense of agility and extreme speed. He took a step in the air and instantly, a series of afterimages appeared in the air. It was impossible to tell whether they were real or fake.</p><p>The fifty sword Qi only hit his afterimages. None of them hit the real Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind force, it’s the wind force.”</p><p>Someone from the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>so he has comprehended the force of the wind. No wonder he is so arrogant. Everyone, attack together and seal off all retreat paths. Even if he has comprehended the force of the wind, he will still die!</p><p>The tall and thin youth roared.</p><p>However, no one noticed that the more than thirty people who had been folded into Arhats by Lu Ming had widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>Wind force?</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had clearly used the force of fire when he attacked them. Now, he actually used the force of wind?</p><p>Could he have comprehended two types of Shi?</p><p>They felt that it was inconceivable. A great Martial Master at such a young age had actually comprehended two types of Shi. What kind of monster was this?</p><p>“Not good, he has not only comprehended the force of wind, but also the force of fire.”</p><p>Gao tiankuo roared.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions Sword School were all stunned.</p><p>He even comprehended the force of fire? How was that possible?</p><p>Gao tiankuo must have been beaten silly.</p><p>At the great Martial Master realm, being able to comprehend a type of force was already a rare genius, one in ten thousand.</p><p>As for comprehending two types of Shi? How was that possible? There weren’t many martial ancestor realm cultivators who comprehended two types of Shi, right?</p><p>They were sure that Gao tiankuo must have been beaten silly.</p><p>However, in the next moment, they felt that they were stupid.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, a terrifying wave of energy erupted from Lu Ming’s body like a volcano.</p><p>This was another kind of force, the force of fire.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>The eyes of the disciples of the ten directions sword sect almost popped out of their sockets, and they were all tongue-tied.</p><p>Lu Ming had really comprehended two types of force. How was this possible?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice like thunder. His body moved and he rushed towards the disciples of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>With the combination of Wind and Fire, his battle strength skyrocketed.</p><p>“Let’s attack together, let’s attack together. Even if he has comprehended two types of Shi, so what? After all, he’s only one person. If we attack together, we can definitely kill him.”</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Rays of sword Qi rose up, and there were a total of 200 rays of sword Qi. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and held the spear with both hands. A huge spear ray that was a hundred meters long formed.</p><p>The spear was so fast that it seemed to be real, like a real spear.</p><p>Around the spear radiance, there were burning flames and a strong wind.</p><p>The wind helped the fire burn more vigorously, like a fire spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear light exploded down with a terrifying vibration.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Nearly two hundred disciples of the omnipresent Sword School roared and their dazzling sword Qi slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword Qi collided, causing a violent boom.</p><p>Terrifying shockwaves spread out in circles, forming gusts of strong wind.</p><p>The ground looked as if it had been plowed, and deep ravines appeared, extending for hundreds of meters.</p><p>The center of the collision between the spear radiance and the sword Qi was blasted into a pit that was more than ten meters deep and more than thirty meters wide.</p><p>“How is tianyun?”</p><p>“He should be killed by now, right?”</p><p>In the distance, the people from the general Star Hall looked at the dust-filled scene and guessed in their hearts.</p><p>But when the smoke and dust dissipated, they were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and stood proudly. His body exuded a strong fighting spirit and he stood straight. What happened? There wasn’t even a scar.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the people from the ten direction Sword School with lower cultivation, such as the third and fourth grade Grandmaster realm, all had pale faces and blood flowing from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming not die, but he even had the upper hand. How was that possible?</p><p>When nearly two hundred people joined forces, even a ninth grade great master would have to retreat. Lu Ming had actually blocked it and even gained the upper hand. This was like a fantasy story.</p><p>The nearly two hundred people from the ten direction sword sect all had their eyes wide open in disbelief.</p><p>geniuses of the ten directions Sword School, that’s all you amount to. Today, leave behind your storage rings, or die!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed toward the people from the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>“Join hands, join hands, don’t split up.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>However, it was too late. Lu Ming was like a tiger in a pack of wolves, charging into the crowd of disciples from the omnidirectional Sword School. With a sweep of his long spear, dozens of people were sent flying. They fell to the ground and blood gushed out.</p><p>They could not resist Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength was too powerful. He had a fifth grade great Martial Master cultivation, the fourth stage of the true war Dragon technique, and his Wind and Fire Force had reached the initial success stage. When combined, his combat strength was terrifying.</p><p>The strongest of these youths was only at the peak of the sixth grade great Martial Master realm, and they were no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Even the few youths who had comprehended force were the same.</p><p>Bang! Bang …</p><p>In just a few breaths, over a hundred disciples of the ten directions sword sect had fallen to the ground.</p><p>Everyone in the star Hall was dumbfounded. Some of them rubbed their eyes hard, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>“This, this … He’s a monster, a freak.”</p><p>Ming Cheng was also stunned and he roared in his heart.</p><p>He thought that he had already thought as highly of Lu Ming as possible. However, in the end, he realized that he had still underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability far exceeded his imagination.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and moved unhindered. With one whip, a large number of disciples from the ten directions Sword School had their bone armor broken and fell to the ground.</p><p>Even a genius who had comprehended force couldn’t escape the fate of having his spine snapped in one strike.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions Sword School shouted. They were simply scared out of their wits.</p><p>There was no way to resist at all. Their strength was on a completely different level.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar rang out, like Rolling Thunder.</p><p>A figure was actually stepping on the void and rushing over at an extreme speed.</p><p>“It’s senior brother yang Zaitian. Senior brother yang Zaitian is here. We’re saved.”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School shouted crazily.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
