He stepped forward and a few martial ancestor realm elders from the royal family followed closely behind him. Powerful auras emanated from their bodies.</p><p>“Damn it, he’s really looking for death!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi roared in his heart, but he did not make a move.</p><p>Right now, it was not yet time for the ten direction sword sect to fall out with the imperial family. Hua Chi was the true Prince, the eighth son of the current Emperor. If he killed Hua Chi as well, it would be equivalent to declaring war on the imperial family. At that time, the four great sects would join forces to attack the ten direction sword sect, and the ten direction sword sect would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>Moreover, there were many experts from the imperial family this time. Even if he wanted to make a move, he wasn’t confident.</p><p>“Good, good, very good. Eighth prince, you’re determined to go against the ten direction Sword School. I hope you don’t regret it. Also, do you think that you can protect tianyun like this? You’re so naive, just you wait!”</p><p>Qiu Wuzhi roared in anger. He waved his hand and left with the disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>The faces of the people from the ten directions Sword School were all gloomy and extremely ugly.</p><p>This trip to the blood ant secret realm could be said to be a complete defeat.</p><p>Although they had killed a large number of students from the general Star Hall, they were just a motley crew in their eyes.</p><p>The disciples of the ten directions Sword School also lost sixty to seventy people, especially since yang Zaitian had been killed.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had taken most of the storage rings of the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect. Most of the blood ant eggs had fallen into his hands. They had not gained a single thing and were extremely embarrassing.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The red-haired old man laughed heartily.</p><p>“Tianyun thanks elder Hong and eighth prince!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and cupped his fists to express his gratitude to the red-haired elder and Hua Chi.</p><p>“Tianyun, there’s no need for such formalities!”</p><p>Hua Chi helped Lu Ming up.</p><p>“Tianyun, this old man should be thanking you. Not only did you help me win a piece of sky Star Mithril, but you also severely suppressed the arrogance of the ten direction Sword School. It’s really satisfying.”</p><p>The red-haired old man laughed.</p><p>“They wanted to kill me, I was just fighting back.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Haha, let’s go back to the general Star Hall!”</p><p>The red-haired old man laughed and waved his hand.</p><p>The group immediately returned to the general Star Hall.</p><p>“First, count your harvest. Come here tomorrow morning to count the number of blood ant eggs.”</p><p>The red-haired elder ordered in a large hall of the general Star Hall.</p><p>The crowd nodded and dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the dormitory and hurried to the Supreme shrine. He could not wait to see what he had gained.</p><p>There was a pile of storage rings in front of him. There were nearly three hundred of them, and they all belonged to the disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>Lu Ming started to count.</p><p>He placed one blood ant egg and one Spirit crystal.</p><p>The other things were also sorted out.</p><p>There were too many things. Lu Ming took a total of six hours to do the inventory.</p><p>Looking at the item in front of him, Lu Ming was dumbfounded. Then, he was overjoyed.</p><p>The harvest was too great.</p><p>The blood ant eggs had been obtained by the disciples of the ten directions sword sect. In addition to the ones he had obtained from the blood ant nest, there were more than twenty-three thousand of them.</p><p>Among them, there were more than 13000 pills in the blood ant nest, and the nearly 300 people from the ten directions sword sect had contributed about 10000.</p><p>Over 23,000 blood ant eggs. This was a massive number. No one in history had ever obtained so many blood ant eggs.</p><p>If six blood ant eggs could be exchanged for one blood refinement pill, then 23000 blood ant eggs could be exchanged for 3800 blood ant eggs.</p><p>“More than 3800 blood refinement pills!” He exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>The more he accumulated before the second bloodline was awakened, the better.</p><p>Lu Ming used a storage ring to store all the blood ant eggs.</p><p>Then, he looked at the pile of crystals.</p><p>There were a total of 620000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming almost drooled.</p><p>In addition to his previous spiritual crystals, he had already exceeded 700000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Robbing is still the most refreshing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Of course, this was just a thought. He couldn’t go and Rob for no reason.</p><p>Apart from the blood ant eggs and spirit crystals, other things like spirit herbs, spirit medicine, spirit weapons, and all sorts of forging materials were also piled up like mountains.</p><p>However, most of them weren’t of high grade. A small number of them were level three, while most of them were level two or level one.</p><p>However, the value of so many of them was still shocking.</p><p>Just a few hundred storage rings alone were worth a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to find an opportunity to get rid of all these miscellaneous things.</p><p>After packing everything, Lu Ming started to cultivate in satisfaction.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming went to the main hall.</p><p>He discovered that the red-haired elder and Hua Chi had both arrived.</p><p>“Tianyun!”</p><p>Hua Chi smiled and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>Other than them, there were also a few elders from the imperial family.</p><p>Soon, more than 20 students who had participated in the blood ant secret realm had arrived.</p><p>“Alright, now take out the blood ant eggs you obtained from the blood ant secret realm and count them. Then, hand them over to the elders of the imperial family to refine the blood refining pill.”</p><p>under normal circumstances, three blood ant eggs can be used to refine one blood refinement pill. According to the rules, if you hand over six blood ant eggs, you can exchange them for one blood refinement pill.</p><p>The red-haired old man explained the rules again.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Immediately, a young man stepped forward and took out a storage ring. The storage ring glowed, and suddenly, many blood ant eggs appeared on the table.</p><p>An elder began to count.</p><p>there are a total of 62 blood ant eggs. 60 of them can be exchanged for 10 blood refinement pills. The royal family will pay 300 spiritual crystals for the remaining two blood ant eggs. Are you willing to buy them? ”</p><p>The imperial family elder asked.</p><p>“I’m willing!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>If the blood ant eggs couldn’t be used to refine blood refinement pills, then it was useless to keep them and might as well be sold.</p><p>“300 spiritual crystals for one?”</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming gasped and his eyes were burning with excitement.</p><p>He even wanted to sell all the blood ant eggs. How many spirit crystals would he get?</p><p>Of course, he was just thinking about it. No matter how many spiritual crystals he had, they were not as important as the blood refinement pill.</p><p>Even if you had spiritual crystals, you wouldn’t be able to buy a pill like the blood refinement pill on the market.</p><p>Then, he counted them one by one.</p><p>Most of the students from the general Star Hall did not obtain many blood eggs. They only obtained around 100 blood eggs, and the highest number of blood eggs obtained by one of them was only slightly over 200.</p><p>On the other hand, Ming Cheng surprised everyone. He had obtained more than 360 blood ant eggs and was temporarily ranked first.</p><p>Ming Cheng grinned. It was all thanks to Lu Ming that he was able to obtain so many. He had followed Lu Ming to kill blood ants in the blood ant nest and obtained more than 200 pills. Including his own, he had more than 360 pills.</p><p>“Now, tianyun,”</p><p>The red-haired old man said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming, their faces filled with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming had robbed most of the storage rings of the disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect. How many blood ant eggs could he have obtained?</p><p>Everyone was very curious.</p><p>“This f * ck, isn’t this table too small? I don’t think it can fit!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the table and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
