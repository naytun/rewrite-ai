I have my own ways. I won’t send myself to my death.</p><p>...</p><p>“What is it? “Lu Ming, you don’t have to lie to us. Is there any way to fight against a venerable? if you want to go, we’ll go together!”</p><p>The fat man shouted.</p><p>“Fatty, why do you have to do this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. All of a sudden, he took a few steps back and stomped on the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Inscriptions appeared on the ground, forming a large array that trapped fatty and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming had long known that fatty and the rest would not leave. He had secretly carved an inscription earlier.</p><p>The formation appeared like a cage and trapped fatty, Wang haoxian, ruan Tingting, and Qiao Xuan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? You’re despicable, using a formation to trap us. Let us out, I want to fight you one-on-one!”</p><p>The fat man roared.</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others also shouted anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and his heart was filled with warmth. He could take the risk but he could not let fatty and the rest take the risk.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Wang haoxian. I lied to you about something back then. If anything happens to me, I’ll break the soul splitting formation on my own!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned around and stepped into the air.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wang haoxian looked in the direction that Lu Ming had left with a complicated gaze.</p><p>“Let’s do it, let’s do it and break this formation!”</p><p>The fat man roared and used all his strength to break the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in the air at an extremely fast speed, covering a thousand miles in an instant.</p><p>He didn’t go to the ocean waves ancient garden, but to the dragon’s head.</p><p>The distance of a million miles was crossed in no time.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the place where the exchange was held previously.</p><p>At this time, the exchange had ended, and the crowd had dispersed. Only a few people were still looking at the huge Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He strode toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Within 10,000 meters, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron exuded a huge pressure, but it could not stop Lu Ming. Step by step, he walked toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron with determination.</p><p>Soon, he was within 1000 meters of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>“Eh? That seems to be Lu Ming!”</p><p>it’s really him. It seems that his injuries have already healed. What is he doing here? ”</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Some people recognized Lu Ming and looked at him curiously.</p><p>After the last battle, Lu Ming’s name had spread throughout ninedragons. Many people believed that he would be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>However, some people felt that Lu Ming’s bloodline was only at the second level of the divine level and his potential was limited. His future achievements could not be compared to the top 100 geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about this, nor was he in the mood to know. He approached the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron step by step.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons in his body roared and roared continuously.</p><p>However, outsiders could not hear it.</p><p>The closer he got to the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, the more violent his nine Dragon bloodline became. It was as if it wanted to rush out of his body and rush toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, but it was firmly suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>He was getting closer and closer to the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Five hundred meters, three hundred meters, one hundred meters …</p><p>A layer of blood-red light emanated behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron let out a vibration that spread thousands of miles away. The entire dragon vein seemed to have trembled.</p><p>Not far away, the others widened their eyes.</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is shaking. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which has never moved since the ancient times, is actually shaking!</p><p>I heard that there was a huge commotion a while ago. I thought that it was fake, but I didn’t expect it to be true. Unbelievable!</p><p>“Why? Why is the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shaking?”</p><p>These people cried out in alarm. They did not expect that this was because of Lu Ming. How could a young man make the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which had remained motionless for ages, shake? The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which even a Martial Emperor couldn’t move, was shaking?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and determined as he strode forward.</p><p>The distance was getting closer and closer.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook again.</p><p>The people in the surroundings were even more shocked. In the distance, rainbow lights were flying over. These people had all rushed over because they had heard the commotion.</p><p>“My God, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is really moving?”</p><p>The people who rushed over from behind were also extremely shocked.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already walked to one of the feet of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had four legs, all of which were extremely huge.</p><p>that seems to be Lu Ming. What is he doing? ”</p><p>The people who came later also recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>look, he’s hugging the cauldron’s leg. He’s going to move the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>what a joke. Throughout history, countless paragons have tried to move it, but to no avail. How can he move it? ”</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>However, the next moment, everyone’s expression changed drastically, and their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>Lu Ming hugged the cauldron’s leg with both hands. Of course, he could not hug it completely. He could only hug a corner.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly, his long hair flying in the wind as he exerted his strength.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>As Lu Ming exerted more force, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook again. This time, the vibration was louder and more shocking than the previous two times. The vibration was like a storm, spreading far and wide.</p><p>The entire dragon vein started to shake violently.</p><p>“The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is moving again, and it’s even more intense. It can’t be. Could it be that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is moving because of Lu Ming?”</p><p>Some people guessed.</p><p>no way. It’s impossible. It must be a coincidence!</p><p>Some people found it hard to accept and shook their heads, thinking it was a coincidence.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared again.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron moved again. One could clearly see that the huge body of the cauldron was shaking. On the ground, there were huge rocks that shattered and stones that flew everywhere.</p><p>“Oh my God, it’s moving again. It’s really because of Lu Ming!”</p><p>“This is unbelievable!”</p><p>Someone shouted while more people were watching the scene with dumbfounded looks.</p><p>In the sky, rainbow light flashed, and more people flew over.</p><p>“The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is covered in dust. What are you waiting for? Now, come and fight with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming howled, his voice shaking the heavens.</p><p>The others were horrified. Lu Ming actually wanted to pull out the cauldron and fight? Who was he going to fight?</p><p>Some of them recalled the grudges between Lu Ming and the ancient dynasty of the central continent a few days ago and gasped. Was Lu Ming planning to challenge the powerful cultivators of the ancient dynasty of the central continent? Such courage, such boldness.</p><p>Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, I know you have a spirit. Fight with me!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to roar, and the nine Dragon bloodline in his body roared wildly.</p><p>The voice of the nine-Dragon bloodline seemed to be constantly transmitted into the divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. However, Lu Ming could feel that there seemed to be a spirit in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that was resisting. It was unwilling to leave the ground and fight with Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are too weak!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice entered Lu Ming’s ears. It seemed to come from the ancient times and was filled with vicissitudes of life.</p><p>This voice could not be heard by outsiders except Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m too weak, but in the future, I will rule the world!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his fighting spirit unparalleled.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At that moment, the lightning cauldron in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness suddenly shook.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
