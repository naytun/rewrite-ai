Its eyes were blood-red, and it did not seem to have any intelligence. Instead, it was filled with ferocity.</p><p>The wind howled as this Tiger-shaped beast had the battle-power of a peak-tier King.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, and a trace of energy burst out. The Tiger-shaped demonic beast was directly blasted to the ground, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed did not slow down at all as he moved forward at top speed.</p><p>Behind him, Wang haoxian was in hot pursuit.</p><p>However, in this forest, their speed had slowed down a lot. Moreover, there were ferocious demonic beasts pouncing on them from time to time, so they couldn’t fly at full speed and their speed was even slower.</p><p>Moreover, the deeper they flew, the higher the level of the ferocious demonic beasts that appeared.</p><p>In the beginning, the demonic beasts that appeared were all peak King tier level demonic beasts. Towards the end, demonic beasts that were equivalent to first level or second level spiritual ocean tier appeared.</p><p>These demonic beasts did not have the slightest bit of intelligence. They were filled with ferocity and would pounce on them the moment they saw them.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and one escaping, only flew tens of thousands of miles in half a day.</p><p>This forest was boundless, and they were still in the forest.</p><p>“Wild beast forest. Lu Ming, you’ve come to the wild beast forest?”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out in Lu Ming’s mind. This voice was not dandan’s, but the voice of the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Ever since he met Lian Cang in the underground world, the Supreme Master of the nine suns had woken up once. After that, he fell into a deep sleep again. He didn’t expect that he would wake up now.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, is this place called the wild beast forest?”</p><p>Lu Ming communicated telepathically with nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“You should have arrived in ninedragons by now, right? this must be the wild beast forest. I left something here years ago, and it resonated with me. That’s why I woke up from my deep sleep.”</p><p>The voice of the nine suns Supreme rang out in Lu Ming’s mind,”It seems that you’re being hunted down!”</p><p>“Being chased by a crazy woman!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“How about this, you can enter the Supreme shrine and hide for a while!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Enter the Supreme shrine?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>In the past, the nine suns Supreme Being had set restrictions in the Supreme shrine, so that he could not enter the Supreme shrine when he encountered danger. His purpose was to train him. But now, why did he take the initiative to let him enter the Supreme shrine?</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s doubts, the nine suns Supreme said, in the past, I only wanted to train you so that you wouldn’t rely too much on the Supreme shrine. If you were in danger, you would hide in the Supreme shrine. This way, you would lose the courage to move forward and the opportunity to temper yourself through life and death. Your future achievements would be very limited.</p><p>however, your cultivation is considered not bad now. Along the way, you have experienced many things and have been tempered many times. Your heart of martial arts is stable. Therefore, this restriction no longer has any meaning for you. In the future, you can enter the Supreme shrine at any time, and others can also enter.</p><p>Supreme martial artist ninesuns explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, overjoyed.</p><p>The Supreme shrine had no restrictions, and he could bring others in. That would be of great use to him.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t be happy too soon. The Supreme shrine was my weapon back then. After you entered the Supreme shrine, it only disappeared into the void, so no one else could see it. However, your current cultivation is not weak. The enemies you will encounter in the future will definitely be stronger. Those in the spirit embryo realm can already sense the void. Even if you hide in the Supreme shrine, you will still be discovered and blasted out.</p><p>as for the spiritual God Realm, one can tear space at will. Therefore, if one were to encounter an expert of that level and hide in the Supreme divine Palace, one would only be like a turtle in a jar, falling into a passive position. Thus, one’s own strength is the way to rule. Relying on external objects will not last long.</p><p>Supreme martial artist Jiuyang warned him seriously.</p><p>“Junior understands!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of hiding in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>It had only been half a day. If he hid in the Supreme shrine now, Wang haoxian might go after Xie nianqing and Kong Jin in a fit of anger if he couldn’t find him.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to continue delaying Wang haoxian. After a few days, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin would have refined all the flame aura that Wang haoxian had left on them. After they entered the vault of heaven, it would be difficult for Wang haoxian to find them. It would be almost impossible.</p><p>In that case, Lu Ming would be at ease.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not enter the Supreme shrine. Instead, he dragged Wang haoxian and continued flying in the wild beast forest.</p><p>As they flew, Lu Ming conversed with the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, why is this forest so strange? not only are the demonic beasts under great pressure here, but even the demonic beasts have lost their intelligence and become extremely fierce.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, very curious.</p><p>Normal demonic beasts could speak when they were in the king’s realm, and they could take human form when they were in the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had encountered quite a number of spiritual ocean tier demonic beasts along the way. Not a single one of them had spoken, let alone transformed.</p><p>there are many wondrous places in the world. Wild beast forest is one of them. Legend has it that in the distant past, the blood of an omnipotent expert was scattered here, covering a radius of a million miles.</p><p>the blood contains the killing intent, resentment, and resentment of the most powerful Masters. When the blood splatters, this place becomes a land of death. The earth’s structure changes, and it is filled with a mysterious field energy. Any living creature that enters will be suppressed by this field energy, and their speed will slow down. At the same time, the demon beasts here will be affected by the killing intent, resentment, and resentment in the blood. They will become extremely fierce and lose their spiritual intelligence. They will become crazy demon beasts that only know how to kill, and that’s why it’s called the crazy beast forest!</p><p>Supreme martial artist ninesuns explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood, but he was extremely shocked.</p><p>This place was actually caused by the blood of an omnipotent expert.</p><p>Blood splattered and covered an area of a million miles, changing the structure of the Earth. For countless years to come, the demonic beasts would be affected by the killing intent and turn into wild beasts.</p><p>What kind of power and realm was that?</p><p>A martial Royal realm expert could never do that. It was not that terrifying, but it was definitely an existence that surpassed the martial Royal realm.</p><p>But now, was there still such a powerful existence in the world?</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, martial emperors were revered. An Emperor was synonymous with invincibility, and they were the strongest experts.</p><p>Perhaps, there were existences that surpassed the Martial Emperor realm in the regions outside the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>He thought of Qiu Yue. It was very likely that Qiu Yue had been taken away by experts outside of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I built a temporary cave abode in the wild beast forest back then. I left many things inside. They should be of great help to you.” The Supreme of nine suns spoke again, making Lu Ming’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>Who was the Supreme Master of the nine suns? He was a Supreme-being, the strongest powerhouse below the Martial Emperor realm, and had stepped into the peak of the spiritual God Realm. How amazing would the things he had left behind be?</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait any longer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
