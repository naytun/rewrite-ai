At the same time, vines, chains, and a cage of fire appeared, trapping Bai chixue in the middle.</p><p>“Nine … Nine formations?”</p><p>Bai chixue was dumbfounded.</p><p>They clearly did not see Lu Ming inscribing the array just now. In the end, they only saw Lu Ming taking a step forward. With just one step, he actually inscribing nine arrays. This was too terrifying, right? Wasn’t this speed a little too fast?</p><p>heart of the earth, this is the heart of the earth realm. You broke through? ”</p><p>All of a sudden, Bai chixue seemed to have thought of something. Her eyes widened and she looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>“I was cultivating in the spiritual energy refining Hall a while ago and I was lucky enough to make a breakthrough. Do you still want to compete?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“No more, no more!”</p><p>Bai chixue kept shaking her head.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took a step forward and the array disappeared.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’re truly crafty. You’ve clearly broken through, and yet you still agreed to spar with me. You’re too crafty, Hmph!”</p><p>Bai chixue glared at Lu Ming, gritting her teeth.</p><p>At the thought of Lu Ming’s proposal of giving her a kiss if she lost, she gritted her teeth. She felt that Lu Ming was deliberately trying to take advantage of her.</p><p>He had clearly broken through, yet he still agreed to compete with her. He was too evil.</p><p>“You didn’t ask for the competition yourself, I never said anything about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Hmph, cunning fellow. There’s no big meal to eat.</p><p>Bai chixue snorted again and ran back to her room with a proud smile.</p><p>“Hey, you can’t go back on your word!”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>Shaking his head, Lu Ming walked into the courtyard, pushed open the door, and entered.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned the moment he entered the room.</p><p>A small turtle was lying on his bed with its legs crossed. It was gnawing on a blood ginseng that was ten times fatter than the turtle.</p><p>Crack, crack, crack. He ate with great relish.</p><p>“Dan … Dandan?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>It’s actually dandan. Didn’t she run away during the battle in ninedragons? Why would he appear here?</p><p>After all, this was the yin and yang mountain. Even a Martial Emperor could not break the formation of the mountain. How did dandan get in?</p><p>“Eh? Lu Ming, you’re back. I’ve really missed you to death!”</p><p>When dandan saw Lu Ming, she finished the huge blood ginseng in a few bites and pounced on him.</p><p>Luckily, dandan had sent her voice to Bai chixue, so she didn’t hear it.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed dandan’s head, lifting her in the air. Then, he took a step forward and an inscription array appeared, isolating the sound. At the same time, the door was closed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? Quickly release me!”</p><p>Dandan shouted, her four legs dancing wildly.</p><p>“You’re as timid as a mouse, a guy who’s afraid of death, and you still dare to come to me? How did you get away so quickly during the battle in ninedragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Don’t slander me. What do you mean I’m afraid of death? I’m wise. I’m far from recovering. I can’t help much even if I stay there. Of course, I have to act according to the situation. While all those experts are out, I went to steal a treasure house. Hehe!”</p><p>Dandan knew.</p><p>“You went to steal from the treasure house? Whose? Martial Emperor Di Yi’s?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in bewilderment.</p><p>“Of course not. It’s just a small treasure vault. There’s not much in it!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes rolled.</p><p>“I don’t believe it. Take it out and split it in half!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I really don’t have any. Let me tell you, most of what I got were spirit herbs. I’ve been using them to recover during this period of time. I’ve recovered a lot during this time and can already inscribe sixth and seventh level inscriptions and array techniques. Quickly let go of me!”</p><p>Dandan shouted, her two claws stomping hard.</p><p>Lu Ming then let go of dandan.</p><p>Dandan spat out more than ten Jade talismans from her mouth and gave them to Lu Ming. these are level six and seven inscriptions and arrays. Look, I’ve been thinking about you all the time!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a piece and scanned it with his mind. Indeed, there were many kinds of inscriptions on it. They were very complicated and there were many inscriptions that even Lian Cang did not know.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and kept it without any hesitation. He looked at dandan curiously and said,”How did you know I was here? Also, how did you get in?”</p><p>“I can sense your aura no matter how far away I am. Haha, do you really need to enter this place? Who am I? The head of the top ten war beasts, the world divine turtle, is more than enough to enter this formation!”</p><p>Dandan burst into laughter.</p><p>“Divine turtle of the world?”</p><p>Lu Ming caught the keyword. Dandan did not mention this word when she bragged in the past.</p><p>“That’s right, the World Turtle. This time, I ate a large amount of spiritual medicine and recovered a little. I finally remember what my name is. This name is domineering, right? Hahaha!”</p><p>Dandan danced with joy, her face full of pride.</p><p>“What’s the World Turtle?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He had never heard of this name.</p><p>“You’re the plaything, your whole family is a plaything!”</p><p>Dandan was unhappy. She pointed at Lu Ming and shouted, I only remember the name. I’m not too sure about the rest. However, the formation in this place is really powerful. If I hadn’t recovered a little, I wouldn’t have been able to enter!</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming was still a little shocked by dandan.</p><p>It was not for anything else, but that he had sneaked into Mount Liangyi. If word got out, it would cause a great uproar.</p><p>“Since you’re here, just stay here and don’t run around!”</p><p>With that said, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the bed, took out the Jade talisman given by dandan, and started to read it.</p><p>There were many types of sixth and seventh-level inscriptions and arrays in the dandan jade talisman. It could be said that there were all kinds of them. It was an eye-opener for Lu Ming and he was so engrossed in it that he forgot about devouring and refining the blood essence.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><p>Ten days later, the competition between the talisman sect’s disciples finally began. It was to fight for the three spots in the heaven observation land.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door and walked out. Dandan was lying on his shoulder.</p><p>“Eh? Tianyun, when did you get a turtle?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked over curiously.</p><p>Oh, it’s a wild turtle I picked up from the ravine behind the mountain. It looks quite fat, and I’m planning to make soup for it later!</p><p>Lu Ming answered casually.</p><p>This made dandan so angry that she rolled her eyes and almost exploded her turtle shell.</p><p>you’re the wild turtle, your whole family are wild turtles!</p><p>Dandan pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>and it’s a king tier wild tortoise. Interesting. Tianyun, let me play with it for two days!</p><p>Bai chixue opened her eyes wide and looked at dandan.</p><p>Dandan was so angry that her whole body was twitching.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they flew toward the competition.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them came to a square paved with white jade. At the top of the square, there was a huge Jade wall that was more than three meters high and ten thousand meters long.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
