She had never said that she was from the Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty. She did not want to be a member of the Xie family.</p><p>Those people from the Xie family just didn’t want her to live in this world.</p><p>If not for the fact that the current Emperor of the ancients was her father, she would have died long ago.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no matter what kind of environment I’ll face when I go back, I won’t die. I’ll work hard to cultivate. When you’re the king of the world, come and pick me up!”</p><p>Xie nianqing mumbled, her eyes glimmering. She believed in Lu Ming. He would definitely be able to do it.</p><p>“Hand over little Qing. Since little Qing is unwilling to go back with you, I won’t let her go with you!”</p><p>Suddenly, an angry roar came from outside. Xie nianqing’s delicate body trembled. It was Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing here? You shouldn’t have come!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with anxiety as he stood up and rushed out of the door.</p><p>Unfortunately, this room was surrounded by arrays. Her cultivation was sealed and she couldn’t get out.</p><p>As soon as she touched the wooden door, there was a flash of lightning on the wooden door. Her whole body flew out as if she had been struck by lightning. She fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why did you come? leave quickly!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted, but his voice could only echo in the small room.</p><p>“Hand over little Qing!”</p><p>From time to time, Lu Ming’s angry roars could be heard from the outside. Along with the angry roars, there were earth-shaking rumbles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Xie nianqing screamed, tears streaming down her face. She rushed to the wooden door again, but just like before, she was struck back by the lightning and spat out blood.</p><p>She did not know what method Lu Ming had used to be able to fight against the experts of the ancient Sage dynasty.</p><p>However, she knew that the Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty had sent a few spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>Moreover, this was ninedragons and the Xie clan of the ancient sacred dynasty was the Ditian divine Palace’s distinguished guest. How could the Ditian divine Palace allow Lu Ming to deal with their distinguished guest?</p><p>Lu Ming was destined to be in danger.</p><p>Indeed, not long after, two more powerful cultivators from the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty charged out. The battle outside was even more intense.</p><p>“Lu Ming! You idiot!”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured. No matter what, he couldn’t stop his tears from flowing down his cheeks.</p><p>There was blood at the corner of her mouth, a mixture of blood and tears, and she was as beautiful as a flower.</p><p>In the sky above the ocean waves ancient garden, the battle had entered a state of white heat.</p><p>Lu Ming used the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to fight against two spiritual God Realm powerhouses. The whole world was boiling, and spatial cracks appeared in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually suppressed two spiritual God Realm powerhouses with the help of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Yes, he had the upper hand in a one-on-one battle.</p><p>how dare you, Lu Ming! How dare you attack the guests of the ancient Saint dynasty? are you trying to frame the Emperor heaven divine Palace? ”</p><p>“Take him down and hand him over to His Majesty!”</p><p>A series of cold shouts came from the sky, and more than a dozen figures descended.</p><p>Each of them exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>Spiritual God Realm. These dozen figures were all peerless powerhouses of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had arrived.</p><p>this evil creature can actually move the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that even emperors can’t touch. He must be an evil demon. We should capture him, get the secret out of him, and then put him to death by a thousand cuts!</p><p>One of the old men shouted coldly, his voice filled with killing intent.</p><p>This old man was wearing a starry robe. He was the elder with real power in the Shangguan family, the grandfather of Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling, Shangguan Zhongyuan.</p><p>Half a year ago, he had repeatedly sent experts to kill Lu Ming but they were all killed by Lu Ming. He had long wanted to find an opportunity to kill Lu Ming completely.</p><p>Now, it was the right time for him to take action.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Shangguan Zhong took a step forward. Starlight fell from the sky and turned into a starry sword, slashing violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>As one of the few spiritual God powerhouses in the Shangguan family, his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, a few other spiritual God Realm powerhouses also made their move. A terrifying attack was directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>In total, there were six powerful cultivators, including the two from the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent, who attacked Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>The entire sky was shattered and cracks appeared in space. Lu Ming felt an unparalleled pressure.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘bloodline in Lu Ming’s body howled and emitted a thick blood Qi.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat another mouthful of blood onto the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It was the blood of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook. Lu Ming swung it and swept it out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All six attacks were blocked by Lu Ming, but his body shook violently. His bones and armor seemed to be breaking, and his body went numb.</p><p>However, in the end, he still managed to block it.</p><p>In the surroundings, the others gasped. Lu Ming had actually fought against six great spiritual God powerhouses alone and survived.</p><p>Although it was because of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, being able to use the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was a very terrifying thing in itself.</p><p>everyone, this kid is evil. Let’s attack together and capture him. We’ll hand him over to His Majesty to deal with!</p><p>Shangguan Zhong Yuan called out.</p><p>In the sky, there were still seven spiritual God Realm powerhouses who had not made a move. They had disdained to attack a junior together.</p><p>However, after hearing Shangguan Zhongyuan’s words, their eyes flickered.</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is of great importance. It hasn’t moved since ancient times, but it moved because of him. We really have to take him down and ask him!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Someone replied.</p><p>Thump thump …</p><p>More people stepped out, their auras violent.</p><p>come! Today, I’ll slaughter the spiritual God!</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his eyes filled with madness.</p><p>He had wanted to use the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to defeat the venerable Guardian and take Xie nianqing away from ninedragons.</p><p>However, the high and mighty spiritual God Realm experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had actually joined forces to deal with him without asking for the reason. In that case, he could only fight today.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>This time, a total of nine spiritual God Realm powerhouses attacked. The terrifying power was vast and mighty. Nine attacks of various colors enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The attack had yet to reach Lu Ming but he already felt a terrifying pressure. It was as if his body was about to explode.</p><p>If he had not used the power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to protect himself, he would have been crushed into pieces.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In his body, the nine Dragon bloodline was roaring non-stop. At this moment, Lu Ming could no longer suppress it. The nine Dragon bloodline soared into the sky and roared.</p><p>The roars of the dragons resounded throughout the world. The body of the nine-Dragon bloodline expanded rapidly, becoming more than 10000 meters long, and entangled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>“That’s a divine bloodline. My God, what’s going on? Wasn’t lu Ming’s Blood Meridian a stone tablet? How did you become a true dragon?”</p><p>“Two divine level bloodlines, how is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Some people who had seen Lu Ming’s moves shouted in disbelief.</p><p>A single person actually had two divine level bloodlines. Could it be that his second bloodline was a divine level bloodline? that talent was too terrifying. There were only a few people in ancient times.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
