If you want to humiliate me, I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”</p><p>Wang haoxian screamed.</p><p>“Humiliate you? You’re thinking too much!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was cold.</p><p>The reason he didn’t kill them was that he had thought of a better way.</p><p>He thought of an inscription formation that he learned from Lian Cang, the God splitting formation.</p><p>This kind of inscription formation was extremely powerful. If it was engraved in a person’s mind, it could penetrate into the soul. Life and death were completely controlled by the person who engraved the formation.</p><p>This Wang haoxian was extremely powerful in both talent and combat. If he could control him, he would be of great use. He would be able to obtain a lot of useful information.</p><p>However, to inscribe such a formation, the opponent had to be completely defenseless. Wang haoxian could not use his vital essence and was weak, which was the perfect time to do it.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger at Wang haoxian, sealing her completely. Not only could she not use her vital essence, but she could not even use her intent and mental energy fire.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a drop of Wang haoxian’s blood. Blue spiritual fire spread out from his finger and he began to inscribe runes in the void.</p><p>“You … What do you want to do?”</p><p>Wang haoxian said in a trembling voice. He was really panicking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with her. He concentrated on inscribing.</p><p>The inscriptions continued to enter Wang haoxian’s forehead. Wang haoxian felt that something new had appeared in his mind and his face turned pale.</p><p>The soul-splitting array was very complicated. It contained eighteen thousand inscriptions. Lu Ming spent an hour inscribing all of them.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming often exhaled.</p><p>“Tell me, what did you do to me?” Wang haoxian shouted.</p><p>it’s just an array. This array is called the soul splitting array. It can penetrate your soul and contain my mental energy fire. As long as I want to, the soul splitting array can tear your soul apart and turn you into an idiot!</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face turned even paler. He screamed, ” you’re despicable! You’re shameless! You’ll die a horrible death!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He pointed his finger at Wang haoxian like the wind and undid her seal.</p><p>He then sat cross-legged to the side and quietly waited.</p><p>He was waiting for Wang haoxian to recover his true energy.</p><p>An hour passed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wang haoxian’s body was engulfed in terrifying flames. Her killing intent was as cold as ice.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s your biggest mistake not to kill me. Now, die!”</p><p>Wang haoxian shouted angrily.</p><p>“Oh, really? Have you forgotten that I’ve engraved the soul splitting array in your mind?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>no matter what you’ve inscribed, everything will be solved after I kill you!</p><p>Wang haoxian moved and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>But the next moment, Wang haoxian’s body froze and his face showed a painful expression.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Wang haoxian screamed in pain. She held her head and rolled on the ground.</p><p>“Stop, stop!”</p><p>Wang haoxian screamed in pain.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and stopped controlling the God-splitting formation. Wang haoxian stopped and knelt on the ground, gasping for breath. In just a short while, she was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Her face was pale. She looked at Lu Ming in fear and shouted, ” you’re despicable. You’re shameless. Kill me if you have the guts.</p><p>“Kill you? Why would I kill you? you’re very useful to me when you’re alive.”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>and I’m telling you, the soul splitting array was engraved by my mental energy fire, and it’s completely at my will. As long as I want it to happen, it will take effect. Moreover, don’t even think about asking the elders of your Wang family to undo it for you. Apart from me, no one can undo it. If you try to forcefully undo it, the soul splitting array will tear your soul apart and turn you into an idiot!</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made Wang haoxian’s face even paler.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Wang haoxian said in despair.</p><p>it’s very simple. As long as you follow me from now on and be my maidservant, it’ll be fine!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What? To be your servant? You’re dreaming! I’d rather die than be your maid!”</p><p>Wang haoxian screamed.</p><p>What was her status? The Wang family’s proud daughter, a famous beauty in ninedragons. She was both beautiful and talented, and countless people surrounded her.</p><p>She was a God-tier heaven’s favorite who was revered by many. As long as she continued down this path, she would have a great chance of reaching the spiritual God Realm in the future.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually asked her to be his maidservant. Maidservant. How could she possibly agree and accept it?</p><p>She would rather die than submit.</p><p>you’d better agree. As long as I want to, the God splitting array will turn you into an idiot. Believe it or not, I’ll sell you after I turn you into an idiot. Tsk tsk, it’ll be interesting if the God-tier genius, Wang haoxian, is sold!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face was deathly pale and her body trembled violently.</p><p>If that was the case, it would be a great humiliation to her. It would be ten times, no, a hundred times worse than killing her.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming with fear and a strong murderous intent.</p><p>She wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move but she did not dare to.</p><p>No matter how fast she acted, she could not be as quick as Lu Ming. She was really afraid that Lu Ming would turn her into an idiot and sell her.</p><p>I forgot to tell you something. The soul splitting array is closely related to me. As long as I die, the soul splitting array will automatically explode. So, don’t even think about killing me. In the future, you must protect me. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wang haoxian was even more desperate.</p><p>“What do you want me to do? I’m telling you, if you want to do something to me, or do something I can’t do, I’d rather die than obey, I’d rather kill myself!”</p><p>Wang haoxian gritted his teeth and agreed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode forward. He reached out his hand and gently lifted Wang haoxian’s chin. Wang haoxian trembled and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>She was really humiliated. The anger in her heart was about to burn her whole body. She was too aggrieved.</p><p>Lu Ming was the enemy who killed her brother. She was here to kill Lu Ming for revenge.</p><p>However, in the end, not only did she fail to kill Lu Ming, but she also ended up in Lu Ming’s hands. She even had to become Lu Ming’s maidservant and listen to his orders. Not only that, but she also had to protect him.</p><p>Was there anything more depressing than this in the world?</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not interested in you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and took a few steps back.</p><p>His casual words made Wang haoxian’s body tremble with anger.</p><p>To be honest, Wang haoxian was very beautiful. He was a stunning beauty with a graceful figure and many suitors. Now that Lu Ming said that he was not interested, it was a blow to Wang haoxian.</p><p>what I want you to do is very simple. After this, you will accompany me in this wild beast forest to hunt demonic beasts and obtain their blood essence. In the future, you will have to come here every seven days to hand over seventy percent of the demonic beast blood essence of the fifth level spiritual ocean realm and above. For the time being, this is all you have to do!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
