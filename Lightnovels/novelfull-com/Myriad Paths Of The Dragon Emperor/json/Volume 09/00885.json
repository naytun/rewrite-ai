If there was such a formation, he would have passed it down.”</p><p>...</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>it seems that Lu Ming not only obtained Grandmaster Liao Cang’s legacy, but he also had other fortuitous encounters!</p><p>Bai Shijin sighed.</p><p>this formation is very intriguing, but its effect is not as great as you think. It’s completely dependent on a strong mental energy fire and the formation to cut off the connection between the opponent and the puppet and take it for one’s own use. Lu Ming’s mental energy fire is much stronger than Feng Tai’s, which is why he was able to do it!</p><p>Du songjue pondered and commented.</p><p>His eyes were sharp, and his guess was pretty close.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had learned this array from dandan. Just like what du songjue had said, it required mental energy that was much stronger than the other party to be able to do it. If the mental energy was weaker or similar to the other party, it would not be possible.</p><p>However, other than Supreme martial artist experts like du songjue, how could ordinary people see the profoundness within? naturally, they were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Meng Chong was also stunned for a moment before he announced, ” “Tianyun wins this battle!”</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar. It was the first time they had seen someone win like this.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The twelve giant wolf puppets growled and turned to walk toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wait a minute, tianyun, my puppet, can you return my puppet to me?”</p><p>Feng tai shouted.</p><p>“Yours? You must be mistaken. These puppets are clearly mine. If you don’t believe me, you can call out to them and see if they’ll care about you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Feng tai stammered for a long time, but couldn’t say a word.</p><p>His face turned red, and he gritted his teeth and said, ” “These puppets were originally mine. Everyone saw it.”</p><p>“Don’t you know that this is a trophy? If you have the ability, why don’t you take it back?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Feng tai with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The twelve puppets growled and stared at Feng tai with cold eyes. They bared their teeth as if they were ready to pounce at any moment.</p><p>Feng tai was so scared that his face turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a wave of his hand, he kept the twelve puppets into his storage ring.</p><p>Feng Tai’s heart ached so much that it almost bled.</p><p>The twelve puppets, especially the six at class ten of level six, were as powerful as those at the exceptional spiritual ocean realm. They were also invulnerable and fearless. In a battle, they were even stronger than a warrior at the exceptional spiritual ocean realm. Each one of them was worth a fortune.</p><p>He had paid a great price to get it, and his heart was bleeding.</p><p>The price of an inscription scroll of the same grade couldn’t be compared to that of a puppet.</p><p>Inscription scrolls were much easier to make because they could only be used once before disappearing.</p><p>As for puppets, they could be used for a long time. The process of making them was very complicated and many materials were needed. They were very precious and their price was much higher than inscription talismans of the same grade.</p><p>His heart ached.</p><p>Lu Ming was in a good mood and he got off the fighting ring.</p><p>Many people cast envious looks at Lu Ming from all around.</p><p>On the other hand, Yan Tongtong and the other paragons of the puppet sect looked grim. They were thinking that if they encountered Lu Ming later on, they could not use the puppet anymore, or they would suffer a huge loss.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming successfully entered the top twelve.</p><p>The competition continued, and very quickly, the top 12 were all born.</p><p>After a short break, they continued the competition to determine the top six.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s opponent was another heaven’s favorite from the puppet sect.</p><p>This person was very powerful and ranked higher than Feng tai. However, he was trembling with fear when facing Lu Ming. He did not even dare to take out his puppet and only used inscription formations to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>He was mainly afraid that Lu Ming would take the puppet.</p><p>How strong could an inscriber who specialized in puppeteers be if he only used formations and not puppets?</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the 12 giant wolf puppets that he had obtained from Feng tai charged forward. With the help of Lu Ming’s formation, they easily defeated the genius.</p><p>The man was extremely aggrieved. He majored in puppeteering but he could not use puppets. Not only that, but he was also surrounded and beaten up by Lu Ming’s puppets. He was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>There was another person who was also extremely depressed. It was Feng tai.</p><p>These were his puppets and they were being used by Lu Ming against the enemy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s competition was unique and not intense at all.</p><p>On the other hand, the other matches were very intense. The dazzling light on the fighting stage was an eye-opener for many people.</p><p>Very quickly, the top six were also announced.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Yan Tongtong, Meng Jia, Hu Ming, Lu Ming, and two other prodigies made it into the top six.</p><p>Next, it was time for the top three.</p><p>After entering the top three, the four of them, together with Ji mai, would compete for the top three, which was also the quota to enter the heaven observation land.</p><p>Many people were in high spirits because in this match, Lu Ming, Yan Tonghua, Meng Jia, and Hu Ming would have to fight at least two people.</p><p>The four of them were all heaven’s favorites who could control their mental energy fire. They had cultivated to the heart’s limit realm and were obviously stronger than the others.</p><p>let’s continue. The first match, tianyun versus huming!</p><p>Meng Chong announced loudly.</p><p>The crowd was shocked and then cheered loudly.</p><p>Tianyun versus H Ming.</p><p>This was interesting.</p><p>This time, H Ming was the biggest Dark Horse, but tianyun could also be said to be a Dark Horse. This was because he had only displayed his powerful martial Dao before, and no one had expected his Dao of inscription to be this powerful.</p><p>In the battle between two dark horses, who was stronger?</p><p>Moreover, H Ming was from the talisman sect. He was not afraid of Lu Ming’s array that could cut off other people’s puppets.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Please, sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>H Ming was very polite. He nodded slightly and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>He addressed Lu Ming as zongzi. This was one of the few people in the talisman sect who addressed Lu Ming this way.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and cupped his fists.</p><p>“Ta!” “Ta!”</p><p>H Ming was the first to move, and runes appeared on the ground. Instantly, a few formations glowed, and red flames condensed into swords that floated in front of H Ming.</p><p>At the same time, light shone in front of him, and a total of fifteen inscription scrolls floated around him.</p><p>The inscription scrolls were opened one by one.</p><p>A few of the scrolls were for protection, forming a fire shield. Some of them formed a fire Dragon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flaming sword and the flaming Dragon attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a powerful flame!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Be it the formations or runes inscribed by H Ming, they were all flames. Moreover, the temperature of the flames was frighteningly high. Lu Ming felt that it was not inferior to the extreme Purple Heavenly Fire cultivated by the Wang family.</p><p>Moreover, although an inscriber did not understand the essence realm of heaven and earth, every inscription was in accordance with the great Dao of heaven and earth. They were obtained from nature, so the array that an inscriber inscribed was natural and carried the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>H Ming had used a formation to inscribe it, and the flames it ignited were extremely terrifying!</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his feet and a blue array flashed on the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
