The weak will go first!</p><p>...</p><p>Bai Shijin and du songjue began to give orders.</p><p>On the talisman sect’s side, someone began to move. Inscriptions flashed as he displayed his figure and leaped onto the floating round platform. He then jumped onto the next round platform and advanced along the platform.</p><p>The people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley also set off. However, just like the talisman Amulet sect, they also set off in batches. The weak would go first, while the strong would stay behind to restrain their opponents.</p><p>If all four sides swarmed forward, there would definitely be a huge battle.</p><p>It wasn’t the time for the battle yet. Even if they killed their opponent now, there wouldn’t be much benefit. The battle would only begin after they entered the light door.</p><p>The people from the four forces moved forward one by one. The people in front had already crossed the abyss and disappeared after entering the door of light.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move!</p><p>There were many people from the sky demon Valley and the Emperor sky divine Palace who were staring at him with killing intent.</p><p>Time passed quickly, and more and more people entered the door of light.</p><p>Very quickly, half of the time it took for an incense stick to burn had passed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a terrified roar came from the sky above the abyss.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked over and saw a young man standing on a round platform. His face was filled with fear. His body seemed to be under a terrible pressure and was breaking apart inch by inch.</p><p>“Gu Huaxu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed as he recognized the young man.</p><p>Before Lu Ming and Xie nianqing went to the chaotic Astral Ocean, they went to the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy to get the heavenly demon fruit. They met Gu Huaxu there.</p><p>At that time, Gu Huaxu seemed to have been possessed by someone, and they had fought together against the ancestor of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy.</p><p>After not seeing him for a period of time, Gu Huaxu had reached a shocking level. The aura he emitted seemed to be at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>However, at this moment, he was under a terrifying suppression.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>die! he roared as green light emanated from his body. A shadow appeared above his head, struggling madly.</p><p>But in the air, there seemed to be a terrifying force bombarding him.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Phantom let out a terrified roar. In the next moment, with a bang, it collapsed. As The Phantom collapsed, Gu Huaxu’s body turned into ashes and disappeared forever.</p><p>a mere spiritual God wants to possess a body to participate in the battle of Providence. He’s simply courting death!</p><p>An old man in the heavenly corpse sect sneered.</p><p>In the Emperor heaven divine Palace, a few Supremes were also sneering.</p><p>With their cultivation, they could naturally tell that Gu Huaxu had been possessed by a spirit God.</p><p>However, the battle of Providence limited one’s age.</p><p>This age wasn’t just limited to the bone age, it was also limited to the soul. If one wanted to impersonate someone, it would be impossible. They would be discovered and killed immediately.</p><p>Otherwise, Overlord powers like the Empyrean divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect, who had many spiritual God experts, would have the ability to possess some spiritual gods and young bodies to enter the battle of Providence. However, they did not do so, which was enough to explain everything.</p><p>If he wanted to rely on possession and use his young body to sneak in, he would be courting death.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not bring dandan along.</p><p>This was just a small interlude. The four forces continued to move forward.</p><p>Time was running out, but Wang Yan was still staring at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Hmph, could it be that Lu Ming is afraid and doesn’t intend to participate in the battle of Providence? ”</p><p>A powerful genius from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace coldly spoke.</p><p>with his talent, he should be participating. Otherwise, he will never be able to compete with the other heaven’s favorites!</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>“Hmph, there’s not much time left. I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>Some powerful heaven’s favorites couldn’t help but start moving.</p><p>Lu Ming still did not move.</p><p>In the sky demon Valley and the Emperor sky divine Palace, many paragons looked at Lu Ming with killing intent and moved one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming is mine. I will kill him. You guys can leave first!</p><p>Wang Yan looked at the other heaven’s favorites and said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave him to you!”</p><p>In the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, even more geniuses made their move. They moved like lightning and flew towards the light door on the other side of the abyss.</p><p>On the talisman sect’s side, some of the thirteen zongzis candidates also moved.</p><p>“Tianyun, no, Lu Ming, take care of yourself!”</p><p>Huan Zhen looked at Lu Ming and then stepped forward.</p><p>“Fatty, you guys go first!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the fatty, ruan Tingting, and Bai chixue.</p><p>“No, if we’re leaving, we’ll leave together!”</p><p>Fatty said.</p><p>“You guys go first. They can’t do anything to me. If we go together, we’ll all be in danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the end, fatty and the others had no choice but to take action first.</p><p>People kept rushing into the door of light and disappeared.</p><p>The time for one incense stick to burn was almost up. All the elites of the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley had entered.</p><p>Wang haoxian was also brought in by the other members of the Wang family.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only talisman sect member.</p><p>In the Ditian divine Palace, only Wang Yan and a dozen men of sacrifice carrying long swords were left.</p><p>They stayed behind to deal with Lu Ming together.</p><p>Other than them, there were a few other important figures.</p><p>“Little bastard, let’s see how you die! Unless you don’t want to go in!”</p><p>Wang Shengtian sneered.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others all revealed worried expressions.</p><p>The atmosphere in the area suddenly became very heavy. Time passed quickly, and soon, the time for one incense stick to burn was almost up.</p><p>With a wave of Wang Yan’s hand, a few men of sacrifice charged forward, while the remaining nine men of sacrifice remained by his side.</p><p>His eyes were flickering. He was ready to set off at any time. If Lu Ming really did not enter, he could not stay here to accompany Lu Ming and miss the opportunity.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>In the end, Wang Yan could not take it any longer and charged into the abyss.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, a round platform exploded. The time was up.</p><p>When the time was up, the round platform would explode.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved. His figure was like a bolt of lightning as he rushed towards the round platform. The moment Lu Ming moved, the nine men of sacrifice also moved and rushed towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on a round platform and his figure moved forward rapidly. The round platform shattered the moment he stepped on it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved forward rapidly, racing against the speed of the collapse of the round platform. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had covered half the distance and arrived at the middle of the abyss.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>At this moment, Wang Yan, who had been charging forward, suddenly turned around and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>This punch was extremely terrifying. It emitted a terrifying heat that seemed to be able to burn everything.</p><p>Level 3 intent realm of heaven and earth, full spirit sea realm!</p><p>Lu Ming could instantly sense Wang Yan’s strength.</p><p>Wang Yan was ranked 98th on the list of top 1000 talents. It was said that he had awakened a fifth-level divine bloodline, a cultivation at the peak of the spiritual ocean realm, and a level three will of heaven and earth. His punch was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate to release three wisps of dragon power at once.</p><p>His body was covered in a layer of scales as he circulated the prison suppressing heavenly art and punched out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent tremor and Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. His body shook violently and he was blocked as he retreated.</p><p>If he retreated, he would be in the void. A terrifying gravitational force came from the abyss, wanting to tear Lu Ming down.</p><p>Once he was torn down, only death awaited him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
