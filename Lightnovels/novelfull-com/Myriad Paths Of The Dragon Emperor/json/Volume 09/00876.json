It was obvious that the Jade wall was covered in inscriptions.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, the White jade square was already packed with people.</p><p>Countless young geniuses of the talisman sect had gathered here.</p><p>Not only young people, but many older people also came to watch the competition.</p><p>“Look, tianyun is here!”</p><p>he really dares to come. The heaven’s favorites will not let him go. This time, we can’t use martial arts!</p><p>let’s see how strong his Dao of inscription is. He actually managed to sit on the throne of zongzi candidate!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>“Tianyun, I hope that your Dao of inscription will not disappoint me!”</p><p>Sunrise walked over. His eyes were very cold and he glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>What happened last time was simply a great humiliation.</p><p>“Not bad, Lu Ming. I hope you won’t disappoint me!”</p><p>Guan Rong also walked past. He looked at Lu Ming with a sullen and provocative expression.</p><p>At the same time, the paragons who had been beaten up by Lu Ming previously glared at him fiercely as if they wanted to bite him.</p><p>“Asking for a beating again, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the paragons with hostility, causing them to turn pale. They snorted coldly and walked to the other side.</p><p>From time to time, paragons would fly over in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming saw Ji mai, Yan Tong, and Meng Jia.</p><p>These three people could be said to be the main characters of the day, receiving everyone’s attention.</p><p>The talisman sect had 13 people in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents. All 13 of them were zongzis candidates and would not be participating this time.</p><p>As for Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, and Meng Jia, they were the ones who were closest to the 100th place. They were also the most qualified candidates for the top three.</p><p>The observatory was also the place that the three of them had the most hope of obtaining.</p><p>“Who do you guys think will get first place?”</p><p>it must be Ji mai. He’s ranked 107th on the list of top 1000 talents. Although the list hasn’t been updated for a long time, I don’t think anyone can surpass him!</p><p>that’s right, I think so too. Ji mai should be first without a doubt. As for Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia, their ranks are quite close. I wonder who’s stronger.</p><p>I wonder if any dark horses have emerged. What do you guys think tianyun will be in the top few? ”</p><p>“It is undeniable that tianyun’s martial Dao is so powerful. No one in the talisman sect’s younger generation has such a powerful martial Dao. I’m afraid that the elders have taken a fancy to his martial Dao, which is why they conferred him the title of zongzi candidate. It’s impossible for him to be very strong. At most, he can cultivate to assist his martial arts!”</p><p>that’s right. It’s impossible to be strong in both. There’s no such monstrous person in existence!</p><p>The surrounding area was filled with discussions.</p><p>At this moment, a group of figures appeared in the sky, and the entire place fell silent.</p><p>The talisman sect master, Bai Shijin, the puppet sect master, du songjue, and a few other elders had all come.</p><p>In the sky, runes appeared, and chairs appeared. The elders sat down in the air.</p><p>At the level of the doyens, inscribing formations in the air was a simple matter.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be the host of today’s competition!”</p><p>A figure stepped out, his voice rumbling and spreading in all directions.</p><p>it’s Supreme martial artist Meng Chong. I didn’t expect him to be personally hosting this event!</p><p>The surroundings were in chaos as many people revealed excited expressions.</p><p>Meng Chong was one of the five great Supremes of the talisman Amulet sect. No one had expected that he would be the host of this competition. The two sect Masters were also present. It seemed like this competition was very important to them.</p><p>Many people rubbed their fists and wiped their palms, preparing to put on a good performance later. If they were taken in as a disciple by any of the elders, they would be rich.</p><p>this competition will be divided into three stages. The first stage is to identify formations on the White jade wall. The second stage is to challenge the ten thousand formation Pagoda. The second stage is to compete with each other!</p><p>“Now, let’s begin the first stage!”</p><p>Meng Chong announced and flew towards the 10000-meter-long Jade wall. He waved his hand and a landscape painting appeared on the wall.</p><p>for us inscription Masters, first of all, our eyesight is very important. If we enter a dangerous place full of formations, we must first be able to see and identify where there are formations and where there are none.</p><p>take this landscape painting as an example. There are many formations on it. What you need to do is to find a formation from this painting. Find one formation and obtain one point. Those who do not have ten points will be eliminated. Those who have more than ten points will advance to the next round!</p><p>As he said this, Meng Chong extended his finger and pointed at a corner of the painting. With a loud roar, a huge Tiger flew out from the painting.</p><p>This meant that there was a formation here.</p><p>“Now, do you understand?”</p><p>Meng Chong looked around and shouted.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone responded.</p><p>more importantly, you have to be extremely careful when searching for a formation. If you find the wrong one, you’ll be eliminated. Thus, if you’re not confident in your chances, it’s best not to act recklessly!</p><p>alright, wait a moment. There will be many paintings on the White jade wall, and the difficulty will be the same. However, the paintings will be different, so you can choose whatever you want. Come up and identify them!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Then, two elders appeared on both sides of the Jade wall. With a wave of their hands, inscriptions were inserted into the White jade wall. Instantly, the ten-thousand-meter-long white jade wall began to glow, and pictures began to appear.</p><p>There was a painting every meter. There were 5000 paintings on the White jade wall, and they were all different.</p><p>There were scenes of mountains, rivers, demonic beasts, and great battles.</p><p>all sixth-level alchemists under the age of 30 can go up the stage!</p><p>Meng Chong ordered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, many figures flew up and landed under the White jade wall. They randomly chose a picture.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He and Bai chixue flew up and landed under the White jade wall. They each chose a painting.</p><p>Not long after, out of the 5000 chapters, more than 3000 paintings were chosen.</p><p>In other words, there were more than three thousand sixth-level alchemists under the age of thirty. This number was not bad.</p><p>Of course, most of them were ordinary and could not be considered heaven’s favorites.</p><p>As soon as they landed on the White jade wall, many people began to observe it quietly, trying to identify the formation.</p><p>The surrounding spectators also quieted down so as not to disturb the competition.</p><p>The painting that Lu Ming chose was a landscape painting. A swordsman carrying a long sword on his back was walking on a mountain path.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the area. Blue mental energy fire emanated from his fingers and he tapped on the branch of a small tree. Instantly, a silver combat sword flew out and then disappeared.</p><p>On the upper right corner of the picture, a number appeared: 1.</p><p>It meant one point.</p><p>Under the White jade wall, the others also waved their hands and pointed. On the wall, all kinds of lights flashed continuously.</p><p>There were weapons, demonic beasts, flames, lightning, and so on.</p><p>The scene was incomparably magnificent and dazzling. It was a spectacular sight to see from afar.</p><p>In the beginning, everyone’s speed in finding the array was very fast.</p><p>However, after finding five formations, many people slowed down.</p><p>In the picture scroll, some formations were relatively simple and easy to recognize, while some formations were very well hidden and difficult to recognize.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
