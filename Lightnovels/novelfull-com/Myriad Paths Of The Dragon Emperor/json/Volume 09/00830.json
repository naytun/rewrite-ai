For example, long Qianli and Wang haoxian, who were ranked at the bottom of the list, had reached the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Therefore, it was rare for God-tier geniuses to appear at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>In the end, a new talent emerged in the heavenly corpse sect. He had awakened a first class divine bloodline, and his combat strength was so strong that he could sweep away everyone.</p><p>In the end, the battle for the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier was won by the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>This caused di Feng’s face to darken.</p><p>In the past, the Emperor sky divine Palace and the sky demon Valley had the same strength, while the heavenly corpse sect was the weakest among the three forces. However, this time, the heavenly corpse sect had won.</p><p>“Next, let’s have the battle of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm!”</p><p>Di Feng announced.</p><p>The battle at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier was even more intense and terrifying.</p><p>However, this battle platform was covered in inscriptions and arrays. Not to mention spiritual ocean tier, even spirit embryo realm experts couldn’t damage it, so everyone could do as they pleased.</p><p>The battle of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier started with wins and losses on all three sides.</p><p>However, not long after, the sky demon Valley sent out a powerful descendant whose bloodline purity had reached ten percent. His combat strength was extremely terrifying and he suppressed the other two sides.</p><p>This person had the bloodline of the ancient heavenly crocodile. His defense was terrifying, and he was extremely strong.</p><p>Three people from the heavenly corpse sect and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had been defeated by him.</p><p>damn it! Does the Empyrean heaven divine Palace not have any fifth level spiritual ocean tier prodigies who have awakened divine bloodlines? ”</p><p>the geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents seem to have all broken through to the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm. If there are any, they must be newly rising geniuses!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew into the arena. Someone recognized that this young man was one of the Supreme talents of Di Tian’s Imperial Guards.</p><p>What made people excited was that this heaven’s favorite had awakened a first class divine bloodline. His combat strength was so strong that he was able to fight against the demon race’s heaven’s favorite.</p><p>In the end, they fought for hundreds of rounds without a clear winner. In the end, everyone discussed and decided that the two were tied.</p><p>However, what made people depressed was that another young man from the sky demon Valley went up. This young man was a flood Dragon with the bloodline of a true dragon, and he had also reached 10%.</p><p>He had defeated several geniuses of the heavenly corpse sect and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in a row.</p><p>it can’t be, right? the sky demon Valley has so many powerful existences at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Could it be that they’re going to lose this battle again? ”</p><p>in that case, the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley will each win a game. This is very disadvantageous for the Emperor sky divine Palace!</p><p>“Indeed. The sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm is the battlefield for God-ranked geniuses. God-ranked geniuses are as numerous as the clouds, and none of them are weak. It’s too difficult to win in the end. It’s the same for the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm. In this case, wouldn’t our empyrean heaven divine Palace fall behind this time?”</p><p>Many people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were discussing, feeling worried.</p><p>I’ll go and meet this flood Dragon. Maybe I can get another piece of flood dragon meat. This flood Dragon seems to be of the wind attribute!</p><p>Fatty said as he licked his lips.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was speechless.</p><p>“Fatty, can you do it? The other party is a descendant with ten percent of a divine beast’s bloodline!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was a little worried.</p><p>Fatty’s third bloodline had yet to awaken. Could he defeat his opponent?</p><p>“Tingting, don’t worry. This fatty isn’t that weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The Fatty’s combat strength was extremely powerful. Before Lu Ming had awakened his divine bloodline, he was not confident that he could defeat the fatty.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, even if the other party had a ten percent concentration of the divine beast bloodline, Lu Ming still believed in fatty.</p><p>The flood Dragon from last time was too high in level, reaching the peak sixth level spiritual ocean realm and having twenty percent of the divine beast bloodline. That was why fatty was suppressed.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming knows me best!”</p><p>The fatty laughed. Carrying his axe, he flew up.</p><p>“Little bug, let this Lord fight you!”</p><p>Fatty chuckled.</p><p>“Fat pig, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>This monster race wyrmdragon was wearing a green robe and had a gloomy expression.</p><p>“Ao Feng, cripple this fatty for me!”</p><p>In the demon race area, ao Qian’s cold voice rang out. Last time, one of his legs had been cut off by Fatty’s axe.</p><p>“What is it called? The flood dragon meat does taste good. There’s still some left. When we’re done, we’ll go back and continue barbeque!”</p><p>The fatty grinned.</p><p>This infuriated the entire monster race.</p><p>“Damn it, this fatty deserves to die!”</p><p>“Kill this fat pig, this is preposterous!”</p><p>Many of the demon race’s paragons shouted in anger as they looked at fatty with killing intent.</p><p>As for those from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, all of them had dumbfounded looks on their faces. Could it be that this fatty had really roasted the flood dragon meat?</p><p>“This is true, I saw it with my own eyes!”</p><p>Last time, someone saw Lu Ming and the others cutting off one of ao Qian’s legs and confirmed it.</p><p>Many people looked at ao Qian and found that he was indeed missing a leg. Their expressions became even weirder.</p><p>“Fatty, you’re dead. I’ll cripple your limbs!”</p><p>Ao Feng’s expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>“Nonsense, eat my axe!”</p><p>The fatty raised his axe and slashed at ao Feng.</p><p>A long spear appeared in ao Feng’s hand, and he thrust it towards the fatty.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A loud sound rang out, and the long spear buzzed. Ao Feng’s long spear trembled violently, and he was actually forced back a step by the fatty.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Ao Feng roared in anger and waved his spear to fight again.</p><p>“Heaven suppressing demon axe!”</p><p>The giant axe in the Fatty’s hand turned into a sky-splitting axe, and like a storm, it chopped toward ao Feng.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>A continuous roar rang out on the fighting ring. The battle-ax and the spear kept clashing, and ao Feng had to take a step back every time they clashed.</p><p>The other people on the scene were extremely shocked.</p><p>It was obvious that fatty had not awakened a divine bloodline, but he was able to suppress ao Feng, whose bloodline concentration had reached 10%. This combat power was too terrifying.</p><p>this person’s combat strength is extremely strong. From the looks of it, his third bloodline hasn’t awakened yet. If his third bloodline can awaken a divine bloodline, he has endless potential. We must find a way to rope him into our camp!</p><p>Di Feng said to the person beside him.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had many descendants. They were also competing with each other and were divided into many camps.</p><p>that’s right. However, this person’s third bloodline hasn’t been awakened yet. If he can’t awaken a divine bloodline, everything will be for naught!</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>hmm, let’s observe him for a while longer. Lu Ming and the beautiful Xie nianqing are also rare talents. If I’m not mistaken, Lu Ming should have awakened a divine bloodline. We should keep an eye on him!</p><p>Di Feng instructed.</p><p>The other man nodded.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, ao Feng roared loudly and directly transformed into his original form, pouncing towards the fatty.</p><p>Only when a demonic beast reverted to its original form could its combat strength be fully unleashed.</p><p>“Insect, watch me cut you!”</p><p>The fat man shouted. His fat body swelled up, and the battle-axe in his hand became even more terrifying. It became a sky-splitting axe and slashed at the flood Dragon.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A violent collision was heard. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves. The fatty became fiercer as he fought. He raised his head and howled, and the axe radiance shook the sky.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as a huge flood Dragon Claw was chopped off by the Fatty’s axe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
