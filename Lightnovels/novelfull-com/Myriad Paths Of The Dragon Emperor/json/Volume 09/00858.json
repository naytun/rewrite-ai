Sect master Lian Cang was actually killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi? How is that possible?”</p><p>“Such a thing actually happened?”</p><p>All the elders were shocked, especially the puppet sect’s elders.</p><p>it’s absolutely true. Master said it himself. The all formation diagram is now half-ruined because master was seriously injured in the battle with Di Yi!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, a figure stepped out from between his eyebrows. It was the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“The nine suns Supreme!”</p><p>The members of the talisman sect all looked over at Paragon nine suns. Many of them had been old acquaintances with him.</p><p>“Everyone, what Lu Ming said is true. I have met senior Lian Cang once underground!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>The words of the nine suns Supreme Master made everyone fall into silence.</p><p>master, master, you were actually killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>Du songjue muttered to himself.</p><p>Du songjue was the personal disciple of Lian Cang.</p><p>“So, do you still want to join Di Yi? If the other disciples of the talisman Amulet sect knew that the sect master, the master of the talisman Amulet sect, had been killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi, and that you wanted to join him instead, what would they think?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu sneered.</p><p>The faces of Meng Chong and the other founding elders of the puppet sect turned ugly.</p><p>Di Yi had secretly harmed Lian Cang and then encroached on the territory of the talisman Amulet sect. They were mortal enemies. How could they rely on Di Yi? If the disciples in the sect knew about this, many of them would probably rebel, right?</p><p>Since Di Yi had harmed Lian Cang, how could he accept them? They wouldn’t be on guard against them?</p><p>This path was clearly impossible.</p><p>what the talisman Amulet sect can do now is to unite and accumulate strength to fight against the Emperor heaven divine Palace and Martial Emperor Di Yi. Otherwise, only defeat awaits them!</p><p>Yan kuangtu shouted.</p><p>“What a joke. How can he fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi? Who can compete with Di Yi if he is not an Emperor?”</p><p>Meng Chong sneered.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>if someone can break into the martial Royal realm, he can naturally compete with Di Yi and even kill him!</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>break into the martial Royal realm? haha, it’s not that easy. In the past 10000 years, how many peerless geniuses have been born in the eastern barren territory? how many of them can break through to the martial Royal realm? On average, there’s only one in a few thousand years. Yan kuangtu, you are known as the heaven chosen of the Emperor heaven divine Palace that only appears once every thousand years. Are you confident?”</p><p>Meng Chong looked at Yan kuangtu with a sneer.</p><p>“I might not be able to do it, but Lu Ming definitely can!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“Him? What right did a young kid have? What a joke!”</p><p>Meng Chong sneered.</p><p>“I think so too. Besides, senior Lian Cang also thinks so.”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme martial artist spoke, causing Meng Chong to shut up.</p><p>The people from the talisman sect could not help but focus their attention on Lu Ming again.</p><p>They could not help but recall the rumors about Lu Ming.</p><p>Even Martial Emperor Di Yi had taken action because of him. Yan kuangtu and master Jiuyang, the two unrivaled Supreme Masters, trusted him so much. Also, why did Lian Cang pass his inheritance to him?</p><p>What was so special about him? He was worthy of the attention of so many big shots! Attention!</p><p>“Everyone, since Lu Ming has received the Grandmaster’s legacy, we can not disobey the Grandmaster’s orders!”</p><p>At this moment, Bai Shijin spoke again.</p><p>“This matter is of great importance. It concerns the future of the talisman Amulet sect. We have to consider it carefully unless Lu Ming can prove that he is worth the risk!”</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve only heard that this kid is very talented in martial arts. However, if he wants to control our Talisman Amulet sect, he can’t rely on martial arts. Kid, show me your spiritual ring!</p><p>Meng Chong said coldly.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. It was obvious that the people from the puppet sect had started to relent.</p><p>This was a good start.</p><p>“Seniors, since you want to see it, then take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and cupped his fists. At the same time, the space between his eyebrows glowed and six spiritual rings appeared above his head.</p><p>Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue, six colors and six rings.</p><p>The hall fell into silence again.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes and mouth were wide open. They looked at Lu Ming in a daze. They looked at the spirit ring on top of his head and revealed looks of disbelief.</p><p>“Perfection, all of them have reached perfection. The first five levels have all reached perfection. How is this possible?”</p><p>Meng Chong opened his mouth wide as if he had just swallowed a dead rat.</p><p>genius, a peerless genius. This kind of talent is comparable to that of Lian Cang!</p><p>that’s right. Back then, the ancestral master Liao Cang had completed the first five levels. For the sixth level, he had lit nine lamps. Lu Ming has a chance of reaching the heights of the ancestral master Liao Cang!</p><p>The patriarchs of the talisman Amulet sect were discussing in shock.</p><p>Bai Shijin was also dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>The reason why he was on Lu Ming’s side was mainly because of Lian Cang’s legacy. No matter who Lian Cang’s legacy was passed on to, he would support it. However, he never expected that Lu Ming’s talent in inscription was so terrifying.</p><p>The first five levels were all in the great circle. In the past ten thousand years, no one in the talisman sect had reached this level except for Lian Cang.</p><p>On the side, Yan kuangtu was also dumbfounded.</p><p>He did not know that Lu Ming’s Dao of inscription was so terrifying. He could not help but smile bitterly.</p><p>he’s a dual cultivator, yet he’s still able to achieve such an achievement. This kid is amazing.</p><p>no wonder he was chosen by Grandmaster Liao Cang. Who knows, he might be able to revitalize our Talisman Amulet sect in the future? ”</p><p>“That’s hard to say!”</p><p>The elders of the talisman sect discussed.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, this matter is of great importance. Let’s discuss it!”</p><p>Du songjue looked at Bai Shijin.</p><p>“I called you here to discuss this!” Bai Shijin nodded.</p><p>He then looked at Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, and the others.”Why don’t you all wait outside the hall first? We need to discuss this!”</p><p>“Alright, seniors, please go ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and walked out of the hall with Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“It’s almost done, but it’s impossible for Lu Ming to take charge of the talisman Amulet sect like this. I reckon that the talisman Amulet sect will put Lu Ming through some tests.”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“There’s no harm in testing!” Lu Ming smiled confidently.</p><p>Then, they waited quietly.</p><p>This wait lasted for three hours before someone finally called for them to enter the hall again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still young and your cultivation level is still low. I’m afraid that most people won’t be happy if you’re in charge of the talisman Amulet sect now. It’ll only bring more trouble. We’ve discussed with the elders and decided to let you be one of the candidates for the talisman Amulet sect’s zongzi. What do you think?”</p><p>Bai Shijin was the first to speak.</p><p>Every sect would have a few zongzi candidates. These people were all peerless geniuses who would compete with each other. Only the one who stood out in the end would become a true zongzi and inherit the sect in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
