He fell heavily on the ground. Both sides of his face were swollen, and it was beyond recognition.</p><p>The onlookers were stunned, including Bai chixue.</p><p>A battle between inscription Masters was not as violent as a battle between Warriors. It was rare for someone to go on stage and slap someone.</p><p>This was the first time they had seen such a scene.</p><p>“You … You dare to hit young master Xu? you’re finished, you’re finished!”</p><p>A young man who came with Xu Shan pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and another nine extreme sword formation talisman scroll appeared. He stared at the two young men and said,”What’s wrong? Do you guys want to try?”</p><p>“You’re despicable, you’re shameless, you didn’t use your own inscription scrolls, what kind of skill is that!”</p><p>A young man shouted. When he saw the inscription scroll in Lu Ming’s hand, he retreated. Lian Cang’s face turned pale.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming had such a high-level inscription scroll. They also did not expect that Lu Ming would be so ‘shameless’ to use such an inscription scroll.</p><p>They felt that such a high-level inscription scroll must have been bought by Lu Ming. It was impossible for him to refine it himself.</p><p>There was an unspoken rule between inscription Masters. In a fair duel between two inscription Masters, they could not use the inscription scrolls refined by others. If that happened, it would not be a contest of strength, but a contest of wealth.</p><p>He would only use it in a life-and-death battle.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn’t easy to activate a high grade inscription scroll.</p><p>“Who said I didn’t make it myself?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He had clearly refined it himself.</p><p>“You’re shameless, let’s go!”</p><p>A young man left these words and helped the still dizzy Xu Shan up, then hurriedly left.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers shook their heads and looked at Lu Ming with some disdain.</p><p>They also did not believe that Lu Ming, this kid who came out of nowhere, could refine a Grade 9 Level 6 inscription scroll by himself.</p><p>The young men who could create inscriptions of Level 6 and level 9 were all top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents. They were all divine level talents, on par with martial arts talents who had awakened divine bloodlines.</p><p>How could this unknown brat be a God-tier prodigy?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s martial arts were clearly not weak. To be able to turn a sixth level spiritual ocean tier puppet into a pile of scrap metal with a single slap, he clearly had very high attainments in martial arts.</p><p>Since his martial arts were so profound, it was impossible for him to be that strong in the Dao of inscription. They would never believe that Lu Ming was so strong in both.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the gazes of the people around him. He called out to Bai chixue and flew forward.</p><p>Bai chixue blinked her big eyes and followed him.</p><p>tianyun, your martial cultivation is so powerful that you can destroy a class 6 Lv 6 puppet with a single slap. What level are you at? ”</p><p>“Could it be that you’re a dual cultivator of inscription and martial arts?”</p><p>Along the way, Bai chixue was so curious that she asked a few questions.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He covered his head and hurried on with his journey. He was too lazy to answer.</p><p>tianyun, Xu Shan’s brother is a God-grade heaven’s favorite, ranked 299th on the list of top 1000 talents. You’ve beaten up Xu Shan this time, so his brother, Xu RI, might come looking for trouble with you. You have to be careful!</p><p>Bai chixue reminded him.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded casually.</p><p>After that, the two of them did not go anywhere else but returned to Yun Peak House.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was inscribing inscriptions in the courtyard.</p><p>After a few days of inscription cultivation, Lu Ming’s speed of inscribing inscriptions had become even faster. He only needed twenty minutes to inscribe a nine extreme sword array talisman scroll.</p><p>This speed was already extremely shocking. If this news were to spread, it would definitely scare a group of people to death.</p><p>On the side, Bai chixue opened her eyes wide and stared at it without blinking, trying to absorb the parts that she needed.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming inscribed another inscription talisman scroll.</p><p>“Tianyun, based on your inscribing speed, and with a 100% success rate, even if you don’t do anything else, you’ll still make a fortune just by selling inscription scrolls!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes were shining.</p><p>How could other people inscribe inscription scrolls so quickly? Furthermore, they would fail and waste materials. Unlike Lu Ming, he did not want any materials. His materials were only talisman paper. The success rate was 100%. It would be strange if he did not make a fortune.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head. This was a good way to earn money. In the future, when he was short of raw gemstones, he could consider refining inscription scrolls to sell.</p><p>The two of them chatted. From time to time, Lu Ming would guide Bai chixue in her refining.</p><p>……</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles away from Yun Peak House, there was another mountain peak with a courtyard on it.</p><p>This courtyard was the courtyard of the God-grade heaven’s favorite, rising sun.</p><p>In the courtyard, Xu Shan was crying in front of the rising sun.</p><p>big brother, you’ve finally come out of seclusion! You have to avenge me! That tianyun is simply lawless and extremely arrogant!</p><p>Xushan shouted.</p><p>“You’re saying that the kid called tianyun lives in Yun Peak House?”</p><p>you’re courting death! Xu RI said coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent and intense jealousy.</p><p>“That’s right, big brother. I’m fighting for you, that’s why I’m looking for that kid, tianyun, to get him out of Cloud Peak Residence. I didn’t expect him to use a class 9 Lv 6 inscription scroll to plot against me. Big brother, you have to avenge me!”</p><p>Xu Shan cried out pitifully and miserably.</p><p>don’t worry. I’ll break his legs and kick him out of Cloud Peak House since he dares to stay in Cloud Peak House!</p><p>The rising sun said.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, a melodious Bell rang.</p><p>The sound of the bell came from the center of the talisman Amulet sect. It seemed to be able to cross endless space and spread throughout the entire Mount Liangyi.</p><p>this is a Hao Bell. When it rings, it means that the sect has something important to report!</p><p>Xu Shan and Xu RI’s expressions changed. Then, they each took out a voice transmission jade talisman.</p><p>When the bugle Bell rang, the major news that the sect wanted to report would be transmitted to the Jade talismans of each disciple.</p><p>When the two of them saw the contents of the Jade talismans, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was that possible? How could that tianyun be a zongzi candidate?”</p><p>Xu Shan screamed in disbelief.</p><p>The contents of their Jade voice transmission talismans were the news that the higher-ups of the talisman Amulet sect had promoted tianyun to a zongzi candidate.</p><p>“Tianyun, the tianyun who moved into Cloud Peak Residence?”</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes were also wide open, filled with disbelief.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s him. How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Xu Shan was still in disbelief.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to become a zongzi candidate. One had to obtain the approval of more than 60% of the elders in both the talisman sect and the puppet sect before one could ascend to the throne of a zongzi candidate. In the future, one would have the hope of competing for the position of zongzi and eventually take charge of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>In the talisman Amulet sect, there were a total of 13 zongzi candidates. Each of them was a terrifying existence in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents with unparalleled talent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
