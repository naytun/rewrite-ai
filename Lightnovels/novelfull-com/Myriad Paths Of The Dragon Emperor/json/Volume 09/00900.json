It wrapped around a round platform and with a pull, his body floated forward.</p><p>...</p><p>As for Wang Yan, after exchanging a punch with Lu Ming, he used the force of the collision to charge forward at high speed.</p><p>“You guys, kill him!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s voice rang out as he instructed his men of sacrifice.</p><p>He didn’t dare to stay any longer. Otherwise, he would also fall into the abyss.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The few men of sacrifice who had set off earlier turned back and charged at Lu Ming. The few men of sacrifice at the side did the same.</p><p>The strength of these death Warriors were all extremely terrifying. They were actually all peak ninth level spiritual ocean tier strength.</p><p>They were not afraid of death and only knew how to obey orders.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword radiance burst out and slashed at Lu Ming’s quintessential essence ribbon while the other sword radiances slashed at him.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was in a situation where he would die.</p><p>Wang Shengtian and the others all smiled.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>Up ahead, Wang Yan laughed heartily. Like a bolt of lightning, he charged through the abyss and into the door of light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The round platform that Lu Ming had tied with the essential core ribbon also collapsed.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, there were a few men of sacrifice.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. On the body of the nine Dragon bloodline, there were four golden chakra, which were extremely dazzling.</p><p>In the next few months, Lu Ming cultivated in the ferocious beasts ‘secret realm. The demonic beasts’ blood essence he hunted was all used to enhance his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>He didn’t upgrade the prison-suppressing stele bloodline for the time being.</p><p>The main thing was that if the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline continued to improve and reached divine level four, the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique would be equivalent to a true low-grade divine level martial technique. With his current true energy, he would not be able to execute it at all.</p><p>Right now, the prison suppressing heavenly art was equivalent to a high-grade demigod martial technique at its peak. The rate at which it consumed true origin was already extremely terrifying, and there was no need to continue upgrading it for the time being.</p><p>The devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline, which had reached the fourth level of the divine level, was extremely terrifying. With a long howl, the devouring power burst forth and enveloped more than ten men of sacrifice.</p><p>Under everyone’s horrified gaze, the blood essence, fresh blood, and vital essence of the dozen or so death Warriors were all devoured, turning into a dozen or so dried corpses.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and an array appeared in the void. Lu Ming stepped on the array and his body flew forward like a rocket.</p><p>After flying for a while, he took another step and another formation appeared in the void. Lu Ming repeated the same trick and stepped on the formation, continuing to move forward.</p><p>After a few times, Lu Ming crossed the abyss and flew to the other side, arriving at the door of light.</p><p>At this moment, all the round platforms above the abyss collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around slowly and looked at Wang Shengtian and the rest.</p><p>I’ll kill anyone from the Wang family I see. Also, the others better not provoke me. Otherwise, I’ll kill them too!</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming turned around, stepped into the door of light, and disappeared.</p><p>that damned little bastard. He can actually inscribe a formation in the air? how is that possible? ”</p><p>Wang Shengtian was furious. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>To inscribe an array in the air, one had to be at least a level-seven Alchemist. How could Lu Ming be a level-seven blacksmith?</p><p>How could his Dao of inscription be so strong?</p><p>With such a powerful Dao of inscription and a powerful martial cultivation, how terrifying would it be? He couldn’t help but worry about the Wang clan’s prodigy.</p><p>“This time, who knows who will kill who?”</p><p>Bai Shijin sneered.</p><p>Wang Shengtian looked at Bai Shijin coldly and said, ” “How dare your Talisman Amulet sect protect Lu Ming and even provide him with resources for his cultivation. Just wait for the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s revenge!”</p><p>Without the talisman Amulet sect’s help, he did not believe that Lu Ming’s inscription Dao could reach that level.</p><p>“I’ll keep you company!”</p><p>let’s go! Bai Shijin was unyielding. After leaving those words, he left through the teleportation vortex. Du songjue and the others did the same.</p><p>After that, the people of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley all left through the teleportation vortex and returned to their respective sects.</p><p>The battle of Providence would last for a year, and only after the ancient city of Providence appeared would the final battle take place to determine the final ranking.</p><p>From there, the ancient city of Providence would descend with luck.</p><p>Now, the people outside had to wait.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the light door. The next moment, he realized that he had appeared in a forest.</p><p>In the surroundings, ancient trees towered into the sky. At a glance, they were all trees that would take more than a dozen people to wrap their arms around.</p><p>“The spiritual energy here is so dense. Also, I can sense the essence of the world so clearly here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>He found that the heaven and earth spiritual Qi here was so dense that it was almost solid. The surrounding milky white fog was formed by the heaven and earth spiritual Qi.</p><p>The spiritual Qi here was equivalent to the total spiritual Qi of a Supreme-grade spiritual crystal.</p><p>Furthermore, the essence realm of heaven and earth here could be sensed very clearly, dozens of times more than the outside world.</p><p>Cultivating in such an environment would allow one’s cultivation base to advance at a tremendous pace. This was simply a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>It was no wonder that everyone wanted to participate in the battle of Providence. Even if they didn’t want any other opportunities, just cultivating here for a year was a great opportunity.</p><p>“I’ll refine the blood essence energy first!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming waved his fingers and carved a large array around him.</p><p>Blue mental energy fire emanated from his fingertips. Lu Ming was still a sixth-level Alchemist and had not broken through to the seventh-level.</p><p>When he was at the observatory, he had lit up nine Blue Spirit lamps. In the following months, he had successfully lit up the tenth Blue Spirit lamp. Level six, full circle.</p><p>All six levels were at perfection. How exuberant was his mental energy fire? How powerful was his spiritual power? He was even more powerful than some inscription Masters who had just broken through to rank 7.</p><p>Therefore, when Lu Ming was at level six, he was able to inscribe an array in the air and carve the array onto the void. It was mysterious and unpredictable. How could Wang Shengtian have thought of this? he had thought that Lu Ming was a level-seven inscriber!</p><p>In an instant, a huge illusory formation was carved.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to refine the blood essence and essential core of the more than ten death Warriors that he had just devoured.</p><p>However, when he was refining it, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes. There was a look of shock in his eyes.</p><p>This time, he found that the nine Dragon bloodline not only devoured blood essence, vital essence, and blood, but also intent runes.</p><p>That’s right, the bloodline of the nine Dragons had devoured the intent runes of those death Warriors.</p><p>there’s the wind, fire, and water concepts. Can the nine Dragon bloodline devour concept runes and refine them for its own use? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart started to beat rapidly.</p><p>If that was the case, then it was too heaven-defying.</p><p>Intent realm, blood essence, true essence, and other energies were different. Intent realm relied on comprehension. Could it be devoured and refined?</p><p>Lu Ming found it hard to believe.</p><p>“We’ll know once we try!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately began to refine it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
