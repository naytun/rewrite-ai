Let’s leave this place and find a place to recuperate!”</p><p>...</p><p>Yan kuangtu said. He swept Lu Ming with his vital essence and tore the space apart. The two of them disappeared.</p><p>A day later, they had completely left the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and entered the territory of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>The territory that the talisman Amulet sect currently occupied was much smaller than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, it still had over 30 large regions and was extremely vast.</p><p>In the middle of the vast mountains, there was a small lake that was like a bright pearl.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged by the lake and circulated the true war Dragon technique to begin healing.</p><p>On a mountain peak a few miles away, Yan kuangtu was also sitting cross-legged, healing his injuries.</p><p>Yan kuangtu had also been injured in the battle with Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>……</p><p>Ninedragons was not peaceful at all. Although the war was over, the disturbance caused by it was spreading far and wide. Countless people were talking about this matter. Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, the Supreme Master of the nine suns, was being discussed by countless people.</p><p>The heads of the nine dragon veins were each guarded by a Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>After the great battle, the nine divine cauldrons returned to their old places. They were like the ancient divine mountains, never moving.</p><p>Countless people went to the heads of the nine dragon veins to observe. There were even countless people who came forward, hoping to learn from Lu Ming and pull out the cauldron.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were destined to be disappointed. How could they touch a divine cauldron that an Imperial path expert could not touch?</p><p>“Why? Why is Lu Ming able to pull out the cauldron and even summon the nine Cauldrons while the others can’t? what secret does he have?”</p><p>perhaps he has obtained the recognition of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron? ”</p><p>“Recognition? There’s a condition to this.”</p><p>I heard that it has something to do with Lu Ming’s bloodline. It’s said that His Majesty the Martial Emperor made a move for this bloodline. Now that Lu Ming is still alive, do you think he will return one day and summon the nine Cauldrons? ”</p><p>“Shush, lower your voice, do you want to die?”</p><p>Countless people were discussing, but they were all very careful when it came to sensitive topics.</p><p>Despite the wind and rain, the nine Cauldrons did not move, as if they were waiting for their master.</p><p>……</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>At the lakeside, Lu Ming’s body glowed faintly. A tsunami-like sound came from his body. After a while, the sound died down and Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>I’ve fully recovered from my injuries. It’s a pity that the nine Dragon bloodline exploded its golden chakra and I’ve returned to the ninth level of the king realm. However, this doesn’t matter. As long as I have enough blood essence, I can quickly advance to the level of a God!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>strength, strength, my strength is still too weak. I’m far from those experts!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming clearly saw the gap between him and the top master of the East barren. In front of Di Yi and Martial Emperor, he was like an ant. There was no way to compare.</p><p>There were also Supreme-beings and spiritual God Realm experts. Each and every one of them was terrifyingly powerful and much more powerful than him.</p><p>His strength was too weak. If he was weak, he would be in a passive position.</p><p>Strength. Everything was because of strength. He had to improve his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>little Qing, wait for me in the central continent. I will definitely go there and take you away. That day will not be too far away!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>This time, he understood that he had been too impulsive. But who had not been impulsive when they were young? Moreover, he had to see the person he loved go to a place she was unwilling to go to and suffer. How could he be indifferent?</p><p>The key was that he was not strong enough. If he was strong enough, he would be able to break through all obstacles. Who could stop him?</p><p>This was the second time in his life that Lu Ming had such a strong desire for strength.</p><p>The first time was when Lu Yao stripped him of his bloodline and wanted to take away the Lu family. At that time, Lu Ming was extremely eager for strength. With strength, he would be able to defeat Lu Yao and regain control of the Lu family, control his own fate, and prevent Li Ping from being bullied.</p><p>But now, he desired strength. With strength, he could take Xie nianqing away, fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi, and protect his family and friends.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p>“I wonder where that fellow dandan has run off to?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming thought of dandan.</p><p>Previously, during the battle in ninedragons, dandan had run away and no one knew where she went.</p><p>“That guy is very cunning. He should be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how are your injuries?” he asked.</p><p>Yan kuangtu appeared beside Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“I’ve already recovered!” Lu Ming stood up and said.</p><p>okay, let’s go to the talisman sect’s yin and yang mountain. I’m an old friend of the talisman sect’s leader. I’ve already informed him!</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“I’ll have to trouble big brother Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Haha, why are you being so polite with me? Speaking of which, the two of us can be considered as fellow disciples. It’s just that shizun didn’t accept you as a disciple!”</p><p>Yan Kuang tu laughed.</p><p>Immediately, Yan kuangtu tore open the space and rushed towards the yin and yang mountain with Lu Ming.</p><p>Half a day later, a huge mountain range appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Although they were miles apart, Lu Ming could still feel the magnificence of the yin and yang mountain as he stood high in the sky.</p><p>Mount Liangyi was the headquarters of the talisman sect. It was made up of two huge mountain ranges.</p><p>These two mountain ranges were like two yin and yang fish intertwining with each other, forming the shape of the yin and yang of Tai Chi.</p><p>Even though they were separated by a vast distance, Lu Ming could still feel a vast pressure emanating from it. It pressed down on his heart and his sea of consciousness, causing his mental energy fire to throb.</p><p>“Two mountain ranges forming a natural array, with the help of the inscription array, is this the Mount Liangyi, which is said to be unbreakable by martial emperors? As expected, it’s the creation of heaven and earth!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>He felt that there were terrifying killing formations around the yin and yang mountain. Once a strong enemy approached, they would definitely kill.</p><p>This was the headquarters of the talisman Amulet sect. After countless years, it had been engraved with a terrifying killing array. This was also the talisman Amulet sect’s reliance. Although there was no Emperor in the talisman Amulet sect now, it was still one of the four Overlord forces. Even Di Yi and martial emperors could not do anything about it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space in front of them suddenly fluctuated. Then, the space cracked open and a figure stepped out.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a long beard. He was wearing a Taiji robe and had a Sage-like look. His eyes were filled with wisdom.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he swept his gaze across Yan kuangtu and Lu Ming. Yan kuangtu, you’ve really caused a big commotion. The battle in ninedragons has shaken the entire Eastern barren territory. I’m afraid that some of the bigger forces have already heard about it.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, are you making fun of me?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a sip of his wine and said casually. He then introduced Lu Ming,”This person is called Bai Shijin, the talisman sect master of the talisman sect. He can be considered an old acquaintance of mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. So this person was the talisman sect master.</p><p>Right now, the talisman sect was divided into two factions, the talisman faction and the puppet faction. The two factions were not willing to submit to each other and had endless disputes.</p><p>“You must be Lu Ming? I heard that you were the one who started the battle of ninedragons. I’m very curious. What is it that could make Di Yi take action personally?”</p><p>Bai Shijin looked at Lu Ming, his eyes full of curiosity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
