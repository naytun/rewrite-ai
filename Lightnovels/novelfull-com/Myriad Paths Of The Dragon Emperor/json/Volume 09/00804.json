No wonder my brother died in your hands. But you don’t stand a chance against me. Die!”</p><p>...</p><p>Wang haoxian’s cold voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged above Lu Ming’s head. His golden chakra emitted a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s pupils shrank and he said coldly, ” it turns out that he has awakened a divine bloodline. That’s even more deserving of death!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a ball of purple flame appeared above Wang haoxian’s head. As soon as the purple flame appeared, the surrounding space turned into a black zone. It was a phenomenon that seemed to burn through space.</p><p>Similarly, a golden chakra glittered around the purple flame.</p><p>Divine level rank 1 bloodline.</p><p>In the next moment, the purple flame twisted and turned into a purple Firebird, which let out a cry.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s body turned into a ray of light and rushed into the purple Firebird. The bird cried and the purple Firebird flapped its wings. It turned into a ray of purple light and pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming merged with his bloodline. The prison-suppressing stele trembled as if it could suppress everything. It flew towards the Firebird that Wang haoxian had transformed into.</p><p>The purple Firebird grabbed the prison-suppressing stele with its claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening sound, a blast of energy shot to the ground, and the two mountains instantly exploded and turned into dust.</p><p>Similarly, a wisp of flame fell, and a mountain range was burned to ashes.</p><p>The space trembled and the prison-suppressing stele was sent flying backward like a meteor. It flew thousands of meters away in an instant. In the process of flying, the prison-suppressing stele turned into Lu Ming’s body and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The terrifying thing was that the blood that he spat out immediately burst into flames. Lu Ming’s body was invaded by the powerful flames, as if his body was about to turn into ashes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His retreating body crashed into a mountain, which exploded into pieces. Lu Ming fell between the broken rocks.</p><p>Wang haoxian was too powerful. Lu Ming could not overcome the gap between their cultivation levels.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed in worry.</p><p>“You should worry about yourself first!”</p><p>The purple Firebird spoke in the human language and turned into a ray of light, pouncing at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>He reappeared in front of Xie nianqing with a huge shield in his hand.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s claw landed on the shield and it exploded. Kong Jin screamed in pain as his bones cracked and his body was sent flying.</p><p>Wang haoxian continued to grab Xie nianqing.</p><p>A bronze mirror appeared in front of Xie nianqing. The bronze mirror was filled with green light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Wang haoxian grabbed the mirror with his claw. The mirror trembled violently and wailed as it flew into Xie nianqing’s forehead. Xie nianqing’s body was also sent flying.</p><p>The Firebird cried out, wanting to continue its attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Crushed stones flew everywhere as Lu Ming rushed out from the rubble. There was a lightning bolt swimming between his eyebrows.</p><p>“If you’re not dead yet, then I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly. He flapped his wings and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A melodious voice was heard. A Thunder cauldron flew out from Lu Ming’s brow. It expanded rapidly to the size of a mountain and pressed down on Wang haoxian.</p><p>The power of the Thunder cauldron was boundless. When Wang haoxian realized that something was wrong, it was too late to Dodge.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge lightning cauldron struck the bird of fire. The bird of fire that Wang haoxian had transformed into was instantly shattered, turning into wisps of purple flames that scattered in all directions.</p><p>After the lightning cauldron struck, it shrunk rapidly and flew back to Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He could not control his body and fell down. Fortunately, dandan caught him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin flew over, but both of them were breathing erratically and were severely injured.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing held onto Lu Ming and asked worriedly.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had used the lightning cauldron and his vital essence had been extracted. His lifespan had been reduced by 50 years and his body was extremely weak.</p><p>“You guys, look!”</p><p>Kong Jin suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others looked forward and saw that the purple flames that had been scattered by the Thunder cauldron were now gathering in the air again. The next moment, the flames turned into Wang haoxian’s body.</p><p>Wang haoxian was actually still alive. He was still alive after being struck by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>However, Wang haoxian was also severely injured. He coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood. His face was extremely pale and his breathing was extremely weak.</p><p>Space stepped forward, holding a battle axe, and stared at Wang haoxian.</p><p>If he wanted to fight, he could only risk his life.</p><p>However, Wang haoxian only looked at them coldly and said in a cold voice, ” “I won’t let you off.”</p><p>With that, he turned into a streak of fire and flew into the distance.</p><p>They retreated.</p><p>let’s leave this place quickly and find a place to heal. Wang haoxian won’t let this go!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He could see the murderous intent in Wang haoxian’s eyes. Wang haoxian must have only retreated temporarily to find a place to heal. Once she recovered, she would definitely come back.</p><p>Therefore, they had to find a place to recuperate. If Wang haoxian’s injuries were healed but they were not, it would be even more difficult.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin supported Lu Ming and flew into the distance. They landed thousands of miles away.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were also severely injured. If they continued to fly, they might not be able to last long, so they decided to recuperate here.</p><p>In a cave, three people were sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true combat strength manual with all his might. Half a day later, he managed to cultivate a new wisp of essential core.</p><p>With a wisp of essential core, Lu Ming could start devouring spirit crystals to quickly replenish his essential core.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also had to circulate his essential core to heal his injured body.</p><p>Another half a day passed and Lu Ming had only recovered half of his essential core. His injuries had basically stabilized and he was no longer in any danger.</p><p>However, he had lost 50 years of his lifespan and his life essence was severely depleted. This could not be replenished.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stopped his recovery. He stood up and walked out of the cave.</p><p>There was no time left. A day had passed and Wang haoxian could catch up at any time. He had to be prepared.</p><p>Walking out of the cave, Lu Ming began to inscribe a large inscription array around him. One by one, the inscriptions were buried into the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming spent half a day inscribing more than ten major arrays.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin both walked out of the cave. Although they had not fully recovered, at least they were stable and had a certain level of combat strength.</p><p>“We will wait for Wang haoxian here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at the sky in the distance.</p><p>A flash of fire streaked across the sky. Wang haoxian had arrived. He had come so quickly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Wang haoxian appeared above their heads.</p><p>you have my flame aura on you. If you don’t get rid of it, don’t even think about escaping from me!</p><p>Wang haoxian’s killing intent intensified.</p><p>For a prodigy like her whose cultivation level was far above Lu Ming and the others, it was a great humiliation for her to be able to injure Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re just relying on your higher cultivation. Give me another half a year and I’ll definitely kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
