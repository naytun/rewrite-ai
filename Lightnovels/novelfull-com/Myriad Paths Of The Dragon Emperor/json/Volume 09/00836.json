No wonder Xie nianqing was so talented, but he wasn’t a disciple of any force in the East continent. No wonder Lian Cang could see through him.</p><p>However, if Xie nianqing had such an identity, why did he travel so far to the East continent and even to a rural corner of the burning sun Empire?</p><p>What was the purpose of all this?</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Xie Zhen in the sky. His face was pale and his expression was bitter.”You came here specifically for me?”</p><p>hehe, you’re half right. We’re here at the request of our Father to form an alliance with the big forces in the East continent and take you back. We thought we would have to ask them to help us with the investigation. We didn’t expect to see you here. We didn’t have to do that!</p><p>Xie Zhen chuckled.</p><p>“I’m not going back!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said calmly.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s gaze turned cold. I knew you would say that, but it’s best if you don’t refuse. Obediently seal your cultivation and come with us. Don’t make things difficult for me!</p><p>“Xie Zhen, don’t call me brother all the time. You, you are not my elder brother, and you are not worthy to be my elder brother. To become your tool and be humiliated by you?”</p><p>go back and tell Xie Qitian that he’s not worthy of being my father. I’d rather die than go back!</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>how dare you call His Majesty’s name? you’re courting death. Do you really think you’re a Princess? ”</p><p>The two young men and the old man shouted in unison as they glared at Xie nianqing.</p><p>The eyes of many people in the surroundings flickered.</p><p>The situation didn’t seem right. Was Xie nianqing really Xie Zhen’s sister, the princess of the ancient Saint dynasty? Why did even a few servants dare to berate her?</p><p>Xie Zhen’s expression completely darkened as he said coldly, ” you’re getting more and more daring. You’re the son of a lowly servant, and you’re a xenogeneic. If it wasn’t for my father’s kindness, I would have killed you and fed you to the dogs!</p><p>“Xie Zhen, you dare to insult my mother. I will kill you sooner or later!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Insult your mother? She’s just a lowly servant, how could she be worthy of being humiliated by me?” Xie Zhen coldly said.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Xie nianqing roared as his destructive cutting power exploded. A beautiful arm shot towards Xie Zhen.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Xie Zhen’s face. His body glowed with a dazzling white light. He waved his palm and a huge palm print formed from white light crushed Xie nianqing’s attack.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s delicate body trembled as she retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>you lowly xenogeneic, how dare you resist? this time, no matter what, you have to go back. My father was too kind before, but this time, I will report this to my father. I will send you to hell, and you will be burned by the demonic flames. Let’s see if you still dare to come out and embarrass the Xie family!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes were cold and even a little disgusted. It was not the look of a relative at all. It was like a high and mighty Prince looking at a beggar.</p><p>He slowly walked out, his body emitting a pure white light. It was even more Holy and aloof. A powerful pressure enveloped Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing retreated, his face turning paler.</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Xie nianqing. The powerful aura dissipated Xie Zhen’s terrifying pressure.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes shifted. Lu Ming had appeared in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s face darkened. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, who are you to stop me? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s posture was as straight as a mountain. He stood there, and a powerful aura emanated from his body. His eyes flickered as he looked at Xie Zhen and said,”I don’t care who you are, whether you are Xiao Qing’s relative or not, but as long as you dare to hurt her, you are my enemy.”</p><p>“Now, since little Qing doesn’t want to go with you, then you can get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was not loud but it was very clear. It was clearly transmitted.</p><p>Especially the last sentence,”then you should get lost!” It made people’s hearts beat violently.</p><p>Lu Ming actually told Xie Zhen and a Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent to scram? Such courage.</p><p>Xie Zhen was also slightly stunned. After a while, he finally reacted. A shocking killing intent filled his eyes, as if he was a high and mighty Emperor looking down on his people. His cold voice rang out, ” “You lowly ant, how dare you speak to me like this? when you say this, no one in the world can save you. Today, I will cut you into eight pieces and feed you to the dogs!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A dazzling white light emanated from Xie Zhen’s body, like a white sun. A sword condensed from the white light cut through the void and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, activated the prison suppressing heavenly art, and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently, and a dazzling white light scattered in all directions, so piercing that the others couldn’t help but close their eyes.</p><p>The white light dissipated. Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took three steps back.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Xie Zhen’s eyes. He seemed to be a little surprised that Lu Ming could actually block his attack.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave quickly. This has nothing to do with you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing called out anxiously from behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and smiled at Xie nianqing.”What are you talking about? your business is my business!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body trembled. There seemed to be tears in his eyes. He bit his red lips and looked at Lu Ming in a daze. For a moment, he seemed to be in a daze and was speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Xie Zhen again.</p><p>“So it turns out that you have a man outside. Brat, your talent isn’t bad. It seems like you’re a heaven’s chosen from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, no matter which power you’re from, you must die today!”</p><p>After Xie Zhen finished speaking, he turned his gaze to di Feng and said,”Brother di, I’m going to kill this man today. You won’t interfere, right?”</p><p>Di Feng’s eyes flickered as he glanced at Lu Ming and said,”I’m not familiar with this person and he’s not a core member of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. I’ll hand him over to the Prince’s Palace to deal with!”</p><p>haha, that’s good. Thank you, brother di!</p><p>Xie Zhen laughed.</p><p>“Nest, Who Do You Think You Are? why should my brother be punished by you?”</p><p>The fatty was unhappy. His figure flashed and he came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan also came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes flickered. Finally, he gritted his teeth and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“This has nothing to do with you, you should leave this place first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to fatty and the rest.</p><p>This matter concerned the ancient Sage dynasty of the central continent. It was no small matter. Lu Ming did not want to implicate fatty and the rest.</p><p>“Nest, Lu Ming, what do you mean by this? You don’t treat me as a friend? Or do you think that my cultivation is too weak to help?”</p><p>Fatty pouted unhappily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
