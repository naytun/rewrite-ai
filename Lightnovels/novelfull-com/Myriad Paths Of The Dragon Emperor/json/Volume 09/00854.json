He blew at his beard and glared, scolding, ” “Little brat, what did you say? Would I be afraid of Di Yi? When this old man was roaming the world, your grandfather’s grandfather’s grandfather wasn’t even born yet. Little brat, I’m telling you, I’m afraid of getting into trouble, you know?”</p><p>...</p><p>However, fatty still pursed his lips and looked at him with suspicion.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign’s aura weakened as he said, ” “Little brat, what do you know? I’m telling you, Di Yi, that kid, is really talented and his cultivation is extremely profound. This time, it’s fortunate that it’s only his avatar. His real body should be practicing overseas. Otherwise, even I might not be able to stop him.”</p><p>Nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu nodded. They knew very well how powerful Martial Emperor Di Yi was.</p><p>If he wasn’t strong, how could he have built the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the East barren and be able to compete with the sky demon Valley?</p><p>One must know that the heavenly corpse sect didn’t even exist before the Emperor sky divine Palace. At that time, there was the talisman sect and other Overlord forces. Only when all the human forces joined forces could they contend with the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>But now, the Emperor heaven divine Palace alone could compete with the sky demon Valley, which showed how strong Di Yi was.</p><p>after this battle, Di Yi’s real body will definitely return from the ocean. However, what can help the number one’s cultivation must be very far away from the divine wilderness continent. It is impossible to return in a short time. But when he returns, he will definitely try his best to find you. What are your plans next? ”</p><p>The devil Sky sovereign asked.</p><p>“Senior, we’re planning to head to the talisman Amulet sect next and let Lu Ming prepare for the war of Providence!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>well, the talisman sect’s Mount Liangyi can’t be broken even if Di Yi’s original body comes. It’s a good place!</p><p>The devil Sky sovereign nodded.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, are we going to the talisman Amulet sect next? Then my parents …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. He thought of Lu Yuntian and the rest.</p><p>The Lu clan was within the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>little guy, this little brat has told me about your situation. I live in the East of the East barren, not far from your hometown. I will take care of your parents.</p><p>also, although Martial Emperor Di Yi’s behavior is somewhat improper, he is still a Martial Emperor. He would not touch your family because of you. Otherwise, if word gets out that he, a sovereign path expert, can’t deal with a junior in the spiritual ocean realm, and uses his family to threaten him, then Di Yi really can’t live in the East continent anymore. He will lose his dignity!</p><p>The devil Sky sovereign said.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He hurriedly saluted the devil-Sky King and said, Lu Ming thanks senior again!</p><p>little guy, you don’t have to be so polite. Since you have offended Di Yi, it’s okay to help you with this little favor. It’s also for the sake of this little brat.</p><p>The devil Sky sovereign waved his hand.</p><p>In fact, he had another plan in mind.</p><p>Lu Ming was not to be underestimated. He dared to attack an Emperor. His determination and courage shocked him.</p><p>For an ordinary person, it would be good enough if they could stand still in the face of an Imperial Dao expert, let alone make a move. Under that kind of heaven-like aura, they would not be able to raise the slightest bit of fighting spirit. They would be defeated before they even fought.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, who was in the spirit sea realm, was able to go against the flow. It was rare.</p><p>If Lu Ming could surpass Di Yi in the future, his future would be limitless.</p><p>On the other hand, he did not have much time left. If he could use this opportunity to build a good relationship with Lu Ming, Kong Jin would be able to use Lu Ming’s strength to go further in the future. He was making plans for Kong Jin.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign then looked at nine suns Supreme and asked, ” actually, I’m very curious. Why did Di Yi want to kill you back then? why is he so determined to capture Lu Ming now? ”</p><p>On the side, Yan kuangtu, fatty, and ruan Tingting also looked at the nine suns Supreme martial artist curiously.</p><p>“It was like this back then …”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme martial artist explained the entire situation.</p><p>damn it, Di Yi is so despicable. I have fought for him for so many years!</p><p>Yan kuangtu growled, his anger soaring.</p><p>I really didn’t expect that Di Yi would be so despicable and unscrupulous. It seems that Di Yi is a man of great ambition!</p><p>The devil Sky Emperor muttered.</p><p>indeed. According to my speculation, Di Yi’s plan is not as simple as the East continent!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>well, well, I’m leaving too. I’m old. In the end, I still have to rely on you to deal with Di Yi!</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign nodded and said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll look for you at the talisman Amulet sect half a year later. We’ll participate in the battle of Providence together. I won’t fight for the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Fatty said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll take my leave too!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting walked over and said.</p><p>“Alright, take care. We’ll meet in the battle of Providence!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>let’s go, little brat. This time, when you go back, you’d better cultivate properly. This time, you’ll know what it means that there’s always someone better than you!</p><p>The demonic Sky King cursed. He waved his hand and swept up fatty and ruan Tingting. He tore open the space and stepped in. Then, the space returned to normal, and the few of them disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, these are the things you left in the Supreme shrine. Take them! The Supreme shrine has been destroyed!”</p><p>A storage ring appeared in the hands of the nine suns Supreme and he handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and looked at the weak remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme. Lu Ming felt terrible.</p><p>Originally, the soul power of the nine suns Supreme had already recovered a lot. However, this time, it became even weaker than before. This time, it was all because of him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry. I’m fine. You don’t have to blame yourself. This battle is a good thing for us!”</p><p>The nine suns cosmos supremacy seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Something good?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>that’s right. When you used your bloodline, the Supreme of the ancient family arrived immediately. This means that Di Yi had already discovered the appearance of the nine Dragons bloodline in ninedragons, so he sent people to keep an eye on it. I have underestimated Di Yi.</p><p>in that case, it will be even more dangerous for you. You don’t know when Di Yi will find out. If he secretly takes action, we won’t even have a chance to fight back.</p><p>after this battle, the first benefit is clear. We don’t have to worry about Di Yi secretly taking action. Also, after this battle, fanatic will come with us. With his help, my soul power will recover faster. Next, fanatic will be of great help to you in controlling the talisman Amulet sect!</p><p>in addition, we can also befriend the demonic sky sovereign. If the demonic sky sovereign can help us at a critical moment, it will be a great help to us. These are all benefits!</p><p>Supreme martial artist ninesuns explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, with Yan kuangtu’s help, he would be more confident in his trip to the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“I have this soul gathering Pearl. It can slowly recover my soul power. What we need to do now is to recuperate first before going to the talisman Amulet sect. Once you’ve settled down there, fanatic will take me to find a treasure to recover my soul power!”</p><p>With that, the Supreme of nine suns flew into the black bead and re-entered Lu Ming’s glabella.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
