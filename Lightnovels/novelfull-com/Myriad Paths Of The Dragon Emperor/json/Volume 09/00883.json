Furthermore, his control of mental energy fire had reached the heart realm. Perhaps, he could really pass through the 36th level.</p><p>Wasn’t this too shocking? tianyun’s martial Dao was so terrifying, and even his Dao of inscription was so terrifying? How were the others supposed to survive?</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and H Ming’s eyes turned serious.</p><p>This time, perhaps tianyun would be a formidable opponent.</p><p>“Haha, not bad, not bad!”</p><p>In the sky, du songjue, Bai Shijin, and the others nodded and laughed.</p><p>“It seems that this little guy still holds grudges!”</p><p>Bai Shijin laughed.</p><p>He was referring to the incident where Lu Ming beat the rising sun into a pig’s head.</p><p>“This is what a real man should do. When the other party bullies you, of course, I have to fight back. I think Lu Ming is my type. No wonder this kid can cause a war in ninedragons!”</p><p>Du songjue stroked his snow-white beard and laughed.</p><p>Ever since they found out that Lian Cang was killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi, du songjue and the others from the puppet sect had given up on the idea of joining Martial Emperor Di Yi’s side. All they could think of now was how to fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Therefore, du songcheng’s opinion of Lu Ming had changed greatly. He naturally hoped that Lu Ming would be as strong as possible. It would be best if Lu Ming could lead the talisman Amulet sect to fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi in the future.</p><p>that’s true. However, Lu Ming’s array is all about fists. Where did he learn it from? why have I never heard of such an array? ”</p><p>Bai Shijin asked, puzzled.</p><p>The formation condensed a fist, and it wasn’t very powerful. It was as if it was specially used to beat people.</p><p>They had lived for thousands of years and had never seen such a formation.</p><p>However, they soon found out the answer.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for trouble, I can only fulfill your wish. This is a formation I came up with two days ago. It’s quite effective, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the front of the rising sun and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming had mastered countless inscriptions from dandan.</p><p>All arrays were made up of inscriptions. Lu Ming had nothing to do for the past two days and had conceived such an array. It was very effective when used to beat people up.</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were stunned as they looked at each other.</p><p>As it turned out, this array was developed by Lu Ming and it was specially used to beat people up.</p><p>At the same time, they were also very shocked that Lu Ming could actually develop his own array. This was something that could only be done with an extremely strong foundation.</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes were so swollen that he could not open them. He moved his body with all his might, full of fear towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun wins this battle!”</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and got off the fighting ring.</p><p>Someone went up and helped sunrise off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Good job, tianyun!”</p><p>Bai chixue was so excited that her face turned red, and she clenched her fists.</p><p>The competition continued. Meng Chong called out names and they began to fight one on one.</p><p>Lu Ming stood below and looked at the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen many battles between Warriors, but he rarely saw a battle between inscription Masters. Lu Ming watched with interest as he watched all kinds of formations flash and puppets pounce. It was quite interesting.</p><p>Meng Chong seemed to be doing this on purpose. The God-grade heaven’s favorites started to move away from each other and didn’t bump into each other.</p><p>Soon, it was Bai chixue’s turn.</p><p>Bai chixue’s opponent was not strong, so she won easily.</p><p>After a day and a night, the two hundred people had all finished their battles, leaving only one hundred people.</p><p>The next 100 people continued to fight in pairs, and Meng Chong picked them.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was at the back of the queue.</p><p>When he went up the stage, his opponent immediately admitted defeat.</p><p>This person was not as strong as rising sun, but rising sun was easily abused by Lu Ming. Naturally, he quickly admitted defeat to avoid further humiliation.</p><p>Very quickly, the top 50 were born.</p><p>Bai chixue did not advance. She met a master and failed.</p><p>Next, it was the competition to advance from the top 50 to the top 25.</p><p>Those who were able to rank in the top fifty were all geniuses among geniuses. Among them, there were more than thirty God-tier geniuses, while the rest were quasi-God geniuses.</p><p>The competition continued. This time, Lu Ming’s opponent was a quasi-god level prodigy. However, he was quickly defeated by Lu Ming’s lightning-fast formation.</p><p>When one’s usage of mental energy fire had reached the heart’s end realm, the speed at which one inscribed the array was too fast.</p><p>On the other hand, Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and H Ming also won the competition in a crushing manner.</p><p>The top twenty-five had been born. What was somewhat unexpected was that a few God-tier geniuses had been defeated by a few new faces. Without a doubt, these new faces were all new geniuses who had risen up and were all very powerful.</p><p>next, there are twenty-five people. I will choose Ji mai to enter the top four directly. The remaining twenty-four of you will fight in pairs until the last three will fight with Ji mai for the top three. Do you have any objections? ”</p><p>At this time, Meng Chong’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“No objections!”</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>The other 24 people chimed in.</p><p>Ji mai was too strong, he would definitely lose if he went up against him. It was better to let him advance directly so that they would not meet him in advance. The others would naturally agree.</p><p>This time, Ji Mai’s strength was recognized as the number one.</p><p>alright, since you’ve all agreed, then Ji mai will not need to compete for the time being. Next, the top 12 will be from the top 24. Yan Tong will fight Gao Lu!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Yan Tongtong flew up and his opponent was a beautiful lady. She was also a God-tier genius.</p><p>Yan Tongtong belonged to the puppet sect and was good at controlling puppets. Gao Lu belonged to the talisman sect and was good at inscription talismans.</p><p>Gao Lu took out six class 9 Lv 6 inscription scrolls. They shone with all kinds of lights, some for protection, some for attacking, and some for trapping enemies.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Yan Tongtong summoned twelve puppets.</p><p>Each of the 12 puppets was not at Class 9 Lv 6, but Class 10.</p><p>The tenth level of the sixth level had already surpassed the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm and was equivalent to the great circle of the spiritual ocean realm. It could also be considered a half-step spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Inscription scrolls and puppets were very similar to the classification of demonic beasts and corresponded to martial arts.</p><p>An inscriber’s strength had little to do with the division of mental energy fire. It mainly depended on the formations one inscribed, the inscription talismans one had mastered, the puppets one controlled, and so on.</p><p>Yan Tongtong, for example, was controlling 12 class 10 lv 6 puppets at the same time. It was equivalent to 12 perfected spirit sea realm experts attacking together. Furthermore, he had set up a formation, and the power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Yan Tongtong, ranked 115th on the list of top 1000 talents, had terrifying strength.</p><p>The powerful puppet easily tore through the defense and attack of the golems and defeated them.</p><p>After that, Meng Jia and H Ming did the same. They displayed astonishing strength and defeated their opponents, entering the top 12.</p><p>“Tianyun versus Fengtai!”</p><p>Meng Chong’s voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward. When he saw his opponent, the corners of his mouth curled into a smile.</p><p>Feng tai, ranked 183rd on the list of top 1000 talents, was very powerful. He was also the heaven’s pride expert who had been beaten up by him last time.</p><p>Feng tai looked at Lu Ming with an ugly expression. He had been beaten up by Lu Ming previously and he had lost a lot of face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
