He was in excruciating pain all over his body and had a splitting headache. It was as if his soul was about to be torn apart. His vision turned black and he seemed to be about to fall unconscious at any time.</p><p>...</p><p>“Hold on, hold on!” Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>“Fanatic, didn’t you want to know who killed me? It’s this famous Martial Emperor in front of you, your Grandmaster.”</p><p>The Supreme Master of nine suns said as he looked at Yan kuangtu.</p><p>His words were like divine Thunder from the nine Heavens and an endless storm that swept across the entire area.</p><p>Countless people widened their eyes and looked at nine suns Supreme in shock. They then looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi with disbelief.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme had been killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi, and only a wisp of his soul remained.</p><p>What was going on? Supreme nine suns was the God of War of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the most powerful man in the eastern barren territory. He had fought for the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and made great achievements. Why did Martial Emperor Di Yi want to kill Supreme nine suns?</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Why?”</p><p>because he needs my bloodline. By killing me, he can take away my bloodline and help him cultivate a technique!</p><p>The voice of the nine suns Supreme Master rang out, and the people were even more shocked.</p><p>The other six Supreme martial artists ‘eyes flickered as they fell into deep thought.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had his hands behind his back and his face was calm.</p><p>Jiuyang, back then, you colluded with the corpse Emperor and tried to kill me. That’s why I attacked you. It seems like you still hold a grudge and want to slander me!</p><p>At this moment, Martial Emperor Di Yi’s voice rang out again, which made people even more shocked.</p><p>Back then, it was nine suns Supreme who colluded with corpse Emperor to harm Martial Emperor Diyi, and that was why Martial Emperor Diyi attacked nine suns Supreme?</p><p>There was actually such an inside story?</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master suddenly laughed out loud and said, ” Di Yi, as an Imperial path expert, it’s fine if you plot against me from behind, but you’ve also fallen into black and white. I, Xia Jiuyang, was really blind back then. How could I have acknowledged you as my master? ”</p><p>how dare you, Xia Jiuyang! How dare you try to harm His Majesty, the force Emperor! You deserve to die! Now that you have come back, I’ll suppress you and make sure you are beyond redemption!</p><p>The patriarch of the Jiang family shouted, his eyes cold.</p><p>The rest of the people also looked at nine suns Supreme with hostility.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang sneered and did not explain further.</p><p>He knew that it was useless to explain.</p><p>This was all because of his strength. Martial Emperor Di Yi was a sovereign path expert. He was high and mighty and ruled the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. How powerful was he?</p><p>Today, even if the nine suns Supreme presented conclusive evidence to prove that he had been killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi in order to deprive him of the nine suns bloodline, the others would not betray Martial Emperor Di Yi and would still stand firmly on his side.</p><p>This was because of strength.</p><p>No one would betray Martial Emperor Di Yi for a half-dead man. That would be stupid.</p><p>If they left the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, where would they find such a good cultivation environment and resources? who would be able to protect them?</p><p>What’s more, Martial Emperor Di Yi had already given a reason, which was that Jiuyang had colluded with the corpse Emperor of the sky corpse sect and tried to kill him, which was why he had been killed.</p><p>Regardless of whether this reason was true or false, it was enough.</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns was well aware of this, so he did not say or explain any further.</p><p>Without strength, what was the use of saying more?</p><p>“Jiuyang, you’re only left with a wisp of your soul. Do you still want to fight with your master? Surrender!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi said.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme Master smiled but didn’t reply. Instead, he looked at Yan kuangtu and said, ” Fanatic, do you believe in me or Di Yi? ”</p><p>“I believe in you, master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes shone with determination.</p><p>good, haha, I didn’t misjudge you. Next, I will block Di Yi. You take Lu Ming out. Remember, you must take Lu Ming out!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Master, let’s go together!”</p><p>Yan Kuang tu shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>die! Supreme Master Jiuyang roared. His body glowed with dazzling light, and nine blazing Suns appeared again.</p><p>a pair of Rascals with wild ambitions. Today, none of you can leave!</p><p>die! Martial Emperor Di Yi shouted coldly, and a Supreme aura burst out of his body, shaking the heaven and earth. He stretched out a hand and pressed down, and a huge hand formed, grabbing toward nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Bring Lu Ming away!”</p><p>die! the nine suns Paragon shouted, and the light on his body became even brighter. This was the burning of his soul power. The Supreme shrine trembled, and nine suns appeared, blasting toward the huge hand that was pressing down.</p><p>Yan kuangtu let out a long howl and transformed into a three-legged golden Crow. He wrapped Lu Ming with a burst of vital essence and charged out.</p><p>However, Martial Emperor Di Yi was too terrifying. He covered the sky with his palm, and the space was suppressed. It exploded in all directions. The sky and the earth seemed to be covered by the palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine suns Supreme, the Supreme divine Palace, and the giant palm of Martial Emperor Di Yi clashed violently. The world shook and the space was penetrated. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>The people in the area kept retreating, and within tens of thousands of miles, only the figures of the six great sovereigns could be seen.</p><p>Yan kuangtu let out a long cry and spat out a golden flame sword. However, it was still blocked. A huge palm print suddenly appeared in front of him and collided with the Golden flame. Yan kuangtu’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was under Yan kuangtu’s protection, he was still affected by the aftershock. The pain in his body intensified and his vision turned black.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The nine suns Paragon bellowed, and the light of the nine suns in the sky became even brighter, completely covering the real sun in the sky. The light on the nine suns Paragon’s body was as bright as flames.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu roared. If the nine suns Supreme burned his soul like this, he might not even be able to keep this wisp of soul.</p><p>“Evil disciple, suppress!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes became even colder. He waved his palm and an even more terrifying palm print smashed down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Supreme divine Hall and the palm print collided, causing a violent tremor. With a final bang, a corner of the Supreme divine Hall exploded, sending gravel flying.</p><p>The body of the nine suns Supreme Master trembled violently.</p><p>The Golden Crow let out a long screech and soared into the sky. It slapped down in the air and the divine fire of the Golden Crow turned into a bright sword radiance, clashing with the palm print.</p><p>The sword light was destroyed, and the Golden Crow trembled and fell.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that the world was getting darker and darker. He looked at the battle in the sky and then at the ocean waves ancient garden. Then, his vision turned black and he fell into endless darkness.</p><p>His injuries were too serious. The explosion of two golden chakras from the nine Dragon bloodline had seriously injured him, as well as himself. In addition, he had controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to fight against the Supremes and even exchanged a blow with Martial Emperor Di Yi. His injuries were also extremely serious. Finally, he could not hold on any longer and passed out.</p><p>“Little Qing, I’m still too weak. I can’t take you with me!”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s last thought before he fainted.</p><p>Lu Ming fell into a coma, but the battle became more intense.</p><p>“Let’s charge!”</p><p>“Let’s go!” Nine suns Paragon shouted. Together with Yan kuangtu, they carried Lu Ming and charged out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
