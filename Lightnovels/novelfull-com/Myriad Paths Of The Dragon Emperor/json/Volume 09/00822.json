His combat strength was even more terrifying. Even Luan Fengyun was crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>This made him extremely shocked.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to him.</p><p>“Now, do you still want to fight?”</p><p>A calm voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Wang Jue.</p><p>Do you still want to fight?</p><p>There was no need for him to answer this question. If Luan Fengyun was easily defeated, then if he were to fight, wouldn’t he be even more defeated?</p><p>Wang Jue’s face turned green and then white. Finally, he gritted his teeth and turned around to leave. He turned into a rainbow light and left this place directly. He retreated without fighting.</p><p>No one felt that Wang Jue’s retreat was a sign of cowardice. In fact, many people agreed with Wang Jue’s actions.</p><p>When faced with an opponent that he could not defeat, perhaps retreating was the wisest choice.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and returned to Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>In front of the stone platform, long Qianli’s eyes glowed as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>He was shocked that he could not see through Lu Ming.</p><p>He still remembered that half a year ago, in the hundred venerates mountain, Lu Ming and the others had to rely on his reputation to leave the mountain. However, in just half a year, Lu Ming had already given long Qianli an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>“Hehe, interesting!”</p><p>On the stone platform, Blood Sword 19 sneered. Then, he looked around again and said, ” since there’s no one else at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier to fight, then Let’s Have a Battle at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Blood glow, you go!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A young man beside Blood Sword 19 nodded and stepped forward, appearing in the center of the stone platform.</p><p>The aura on his body burst out.</p><p>The peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>“Fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, who’s going to come up and fight!”</p><p>Xue mang’s face was pale, but his eyes were as red as blood.</p><p>The surroundings of the stone platform were completely silent.</p><p>This time, the sky corpse sect had obviously sent out top experts of all levels. Their combat strength was almost invincible among those of the same level. This bloody light was obviously such a figure.</p><p>If one didn’t have the confidence, going up would only be embarrassing.</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>After a while, a voice was heard. A young man in a red robe flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>Everyone recognized that this person was a quasi-God prodigy of the Wang clan. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blazing flames filled the air as the Wang clan’s heaven’s favorite roared and charged toward the blood-red light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword hummed as the blood-colored sword Qi surged. The blood-colored light emitted a dense blood Qi as it fought with the Wang clan’s heaven’s favorite.</p><p>the blood intent realm of the heavenly corpse sect is extremely powerful. The Wang family is no match for it!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Sure enough, after a dozen moves, the Wang clan’s Paragon was no match for him and was suppressed. After a few more moves, he was forced to cough up blood from the blood-red light and lost.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight?”</p><p>The bloody glow continued to challenge him with a hint of disdain in its eyes.</p><p>“Dammit, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A burly young man roared and rushed up the stone platform.</p><p>However, this young man was even weaker than the Wang clan’s heaven’s pride expert. He was defeated in less than ten moves.</p><p>For a time, no one went up the stage to fight.</p><p>it’s a pity that Luan Fengyun was defeated. Originally, Luan Fengyun was an important battle power of the fifth level spiritual ocean tier, and might be the strongest fifth level spiritual ocean tier at the scene. He might have been able to fight the other party!</p><p>“Now that Luan Fengyun’s arm has been severed, no one at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier can fight him!”</p><p>Soft discussions could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>chaotic wind and cloud is nothing. Let me teach him how to behave!</p><p>When the fatty heard this, he was instantly displeased. He grinned, carried his battle-axe, and stepped forward onto the stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest smiled. They were not worried about the fatty.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, unless fatty encountered a genius who had awakened a divine bloodline, he would not lose.</p><p>“Brat, you’re very arrogant. Let me ‘serve’ you!”</p><p>The fat man held the axe in one hand and spun a few times in the air. The door-sized axe whistled with the wind as it looked at the blood-red light provocatively. It was as if he was a peerless master.</p><p>“This fatty, can he do it?”</p><p>Some people expressed their doubts.</p><p>“I should be able to, right? Back at the hundred venerated mountains, this fatty and Lu Ming fought against the Luan family and the Jiang family’s experts. The combat strength they displayed was also extremely powerful.”</p><p>Someone replied.</p><p>Some of them looked at fatty with hope, hoping that he would win.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The blood-red light was very straightforward. The blood-red sword Qi soared into the sky and slashed at fatty.</p><p>nest, I haven’t even told you to start, and you’ve already made a move. You’re cheating!</p><p>The fat man shouted. He turned the broad axe in his hand and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blood-red sword light stabbed the fat man’s broad axe, making a sound of metal clashing.</p><p>“You dare to sneak attack me, take this!”</p><p>The fat man’s battle-ax shook, and the blood-red light felt a great force. His expression changed, and his body could not help but retreat.</p><p>The moment he retreated, he was greeted by Fatty’s storm-like attacks.</p><p>The battle-ax was like a whirlwind, continuously slashing at the blood-red light. Every strike seemed to be able to split the sky.</p><p>The blood-red light’s expression changed drastically. It tried its best to block, but with every move it blocked, it would take a step back. After ten consecutive axe strikes, the blood-red light spat out a large mouthful of blood and was sent flying.</p><p>He won. The fatty had won with a crushing force.</p><p>Many people didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>“Haha, you’re really weak!”</p><p>The fat man laughed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Fatty, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Many people laughed out loud, revealing carefree expressions.</p><p>He had finally won one battle. He had lost too many battles in the past two days. He had been caught off guard by the heavenly corpse sect and lost many battles in a row. Now, he had finally won one battle.</p><p>this fatty is standing together with Lu Ming. Of course, he’s not bad. Birds of a feather flock together. Those who are able to walk together are most likely geniuses of the same level!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The discussions around him made fatty feel even more comfortable.</p><p>haha, heavenly corpse sect, do you have any stronger ones? hurry up and send them out. I’ll take care of them one by one!</p><p>The battle-axe in Fatty’s hand swayed back and forth, causing a strong wind to blow.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Bloodsword 19 snorted coldly.</p><p>This time, Xue mang was the strongest among the fifth level spiritual ocean tier geniuses that he had brought. He had originally thought that he would be able to obtain consecutive victories by catching the Empyrean heaven divine Palace off guard and dampen their spirit. He didn’t expect a fatty to appear out of nowhere with unbelievable battle prowess.</p><p>did you awaken a divine bloodline? ”</p><p>The 19th Blood Sword asked coldly.</p><p>If fatty was a God-tier prodigy who had awakened a God-tier bloodline, there would be no glory even if he won.</p><p>nonsense! If I had awakened a divine bloodline, I wouldn’t have needed so many moves to defeat him. One move would have been enough! The fat man pouted.</p><p>“Alright, you guys win this battle!”</p><p>The 19th Blood Sword then turned to long Qianli and said, ” long Qianli, why don’t we have a battle between God-tier geniuses? ”</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone’s hearts trembled and their eyes lit up.</p><p>The main event was about to begin. It was finally time for the battle between the God-tier prodigies.</p><p>Awakening a divine bloodline and not awakening a divine bloodline were two different concepts.</p><p>Most of the heaven’s pride experts only awakened a King-level bloodline, and many of them were only at the ninth level.</p><p>It was too difficult to awaken a divine bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
