Senior Sister Meng Jia who’s 118!”</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise, because they saw three extraordinary heaven’s favorites.</p><p>These three people could be said to be the talisman sect’s conquerors who were closest to the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents. They were also the most qualified candidates for the zongzi position. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>The three of them were expressionless and their eyes were closed. They were sitting on a huge rock and waiting quietly.</p><p>Bai chixue had also heard the news and rushed over. She looked anxious.</p><p>Although she knew that Lu Ming was very powerful and could refine ninth-grade sixth-level inscription scrolls, which of the top 300 divine level talents on the list of top 1000 talents could not refine ninth-grade sixth-level inscription scrolls?</p><p>This was especially true for the paragons of the puppet sect. They could control powerful puppets and had extremely strong combat strength.</p><p>She did not think that Lu Ming could compete with such a genius.</p><p>“Tianyun, stay in the wind martial cave for a while longer. Don’t come out!”</p><p>Bai chixue prayed in her heart.</p><p>……</p><p>In the wind martial cave, after five days of cultivation, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“It’s really an opportunity that can’t be sought!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of going out.</p><p>With the breakthrough of the earth essence realm, Lu Ming’s four essence realms of heaven and earth had all reached level two upper tier and above. His cultivation could continue to improve.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to improve his cultivation before leaving.</p><p>He sat cross-legged and waved his hand. A pile of raw gemstones appeared on the ground, and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. He opened his mouth and inhaled. The devouring power burst out, and at least two hundred raw gemstones exploded. The surging original Qi was devoured by the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Origin Qi was the Qi of the origin of heaven and earth. It was many times stronger than spirit Qi.</p><p>His spirit ocean churned as his true essence continued to rise.</p><p>Not long after, two hundred raw gemstones were refined and another two hundred were devoured.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>True essence rumbled like a tsunami, and the rumbling only stopped after half a day.</p><p>Seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>Lu Ming broke through to the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm in one go. The area of his spirit ocean had doubled again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop and continued to refine the origin stone. After another half a day, Lu Ming’s cultivation rose to the peak seventh level spiritual ocean realm before he stopped cultivating.</p><p>In total, he had consumed three thousand raw gemstones.</p><p>“Fortunately, I have the wealth left behind by senior Jiuyang. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>It was time to leave. It had been eight days since he came to the wind martial cave for closed-door cultivation.</p><p>In the past eight days, his strength had increased to a terrifying level.</p><p>With a faint smile, Lu Ming walked out. When he exited the wind martial cave, he was stunned.</p><p>Outside, there was a dense crowd of people surrounding the wind martial cave.</p><p>“WOWO, aren’t these people a little too enthusiastic? Did they all wait for me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming could guess what was going on. He was speechless.</p><p>“Tianyun has come out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came out, someone shouted.</p><p>Countless pairs of eyes looked at Lu Ming in unison.</p><p>“He’s so young and ordinary. I thought he had three heads and six arms!”</p><p>he’s not ordinary. Don’t you think he’s very handsome? ”</p><p>“Pooh, love-struck fool, get lost!”</p><p>Instantly, a series of discussions broke out.</p><p>Many young women’s eyes lit up. They felt that Lu Ming was very handsome, which made many young men unhappy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure strode out and stood in front of Lu Ming. His eyes were dark as he said, tianyun, you’ve finally come out! I thought you were going to hide like a turtle in its shell! Let’s see where you’re going to run off to today!</p><p>The one who spoke was rising sun, and he was the first to step forward.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at him and said indifferently, ” it seems that I didn’t beat you up last time. You’re really itching for a beating. Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish today!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward.</p><p>Today, there were so many people gathered here. He would kill the chicken to warn the monkeys, so that he wouldn’t be annoyed to death by these people.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes turned cold. With a wave of his hand, seven huge puppets appeared in front of him. Three of them were equivalent to the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and four were equivalent to the peak of the eighth level.</p><p>When the seven puppets attacked together, they were comparable to an expert at the peak ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Sunrise was ranked in the top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents and was known as a God-level talent. He was definitely not weak and could control seven powerful puppets at once. He was definitely not weaker than Wang haoxian and long Qianli.</p><p>The seven puppets roared and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun, be careful!”</p><p>Bai chixue shouted from the crowd.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He did not stop and slapped.</p><p>Many people were stunned. Lu Ming was going to fight the puppet with his body?</p><p>Many people sneered in their hearts. Puppets were made of all kinds of hard and powerful metals. They were impervious to swords and Spears, so how could flesh and blood resist them?</p><p>But the next moment, their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming smacked a puppet at the peak of the eighth level of the spiritual ocean realm with his palm. This puppet, which weighed a few million pounds, was sent flying and exploded into a pile of scrap metal in the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming used both his hands and feet, looking like a terrifying God of War.</p><p>With a punch, a puppet exploded. With a kick, another puppet exploded.</p><p>Whether it was a puppet at the peak eighth level of the spiritual ocean realm or a puppet at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm, the outcome was the same. They were instantly turned into a pile of scrap metal.</p><p>Countless people rubbed their eyes, thinking that they were dreaming. How could this be possible? How did this happen?</p><p>An inscriber’s main focus was on mental fire. The strength of their body was much weaker than that of a warrior. They had never seen such a direct, overbearing, and violent way of fighting, where they used their bodies to crush the puppets and turn them into scrap metal.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and rushed toward the rising sun.</p><p>“Impossible? How did this happen?”</p><p>die! sunrise roared and an inscription scroll appeared in his hand. He opened it and a combat sword appeared. He slashed it at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>This inscription talisman scroll had the attack power of a peak ninth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>However, with a wave of Lu Ming’s hand, the combat sword collapsed. Lu Ming’s figure instantly appeared in front of sunrise and he slapped him.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of a slap resounded throughout the entire place. Many people felt their gums ache, and sunrise screamed even more miserably. His teeth flew out mixed with blood, and half of his face swelled up high.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>With a backhand, he slapped sunrise again, making him dizzy and unable to sense his direction.</p><p>Then, he kicked out and sunrise was sent flying. He lay on the ground and screamed like a dead fish.</p><p>Many people drew in a breath of cold air. This tianyun was simply too overbearing and violent! He had defeated sunrise so easily! One must know that sunrise was a god tier genius!</p><p>how dare you, tianyun! You’re actually so vicious! You’ve seriously injured your fellow disciples! You’ve committed a heinous crime!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite that was stronger than the rising sun roared.</p><p>don’t f * cking grumble. If you want to attack, then attack. If you don’t dare to attack, then get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>It was a young man with a Jade crown on his head. He was fair and clean. Simply put, he was a pretty boy.</p><p>Guan Rong, who was ranked 259th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Someone recognized the young man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
