Bai chixue frowned and a blue spiritual fire glowed on his fingertips. Some powder-like materials were sucked into the air and turned into runes under his fingers, then they were absorbed into the paper.</p><p>Inscriptions would appear on the white paper, intertwining with each other, creating a beautiful and dazzling sight.</p><p>a class 7 Lv 6 sky-fire godly sword!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Bai chixue was refining a seventh level Sky Fire sword inscription scroll. Once this inscription scroll was activated, it could release a Sky Fire sword, which was equivalent to the attack power of the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to leave. He appeared behind Bai chixue silently and watched with great interest.</p><p>Bai chixue’s technique was very exquisite, and her speed of inscribing was also very good at controlling the spiritual fire.</p><p>his usage of mental energy fire has already reached the advanced stage of ‘minute subtlety’. As expected of Bai Shijin’s disciple. Impressive!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly admired her.</p><p>Besides the strength of one’s mental energy fire, an inscription master’s combat strength and mastery of their Dao of inscription were also related to their usage of the mental energy.</p><p>If one’s mental energy fire was used to an extremely profound level, one could completely defeat a stronger opponent, just like fighting above one’s level in martial arts.</p><p>The usage of mental energy fire could be divided into five realms.</p><p>Adept, minute, heart, intent, and divine.</p><p>Each realm was further divided into the early stage, middle stage, late stage, and peak stage.</p><p>Generally speaking, a rank 6 Alchemist who could reach the minute subtlety was already considered a genius. The third realm, the heart, usually required a rank 7 Alchemist to master.</p><p>Intent movement required a rank eight inscriber to master it, while the Shenhe required a rank nine Imperial path expert.</p><p>Bai chixue was very young, but she could control her spiritual fire to the late stage of refinement, which was already very rare. She could be considered a peerless genius.</p><p>Bai chixue’s fingers were moving in the air smoothly. Inscriptions flew into the paper one after another. The sky-fire godly sword talisman scroll was about to be completed.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>Suddenly, a cloud of green smoke came out of the talisman scroll. The entire talisman scroll burst into flames and burned fiercely, turning into ashes in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Failed again? what’s going on? Can’t I inscribe a rank 7 Lv 6 spell scroll with my current cultivation?”</p><p>Bai chixue gritted her teeth and frowned.</p><p>At this moment, he realized that there was something strange behind him. He turned around and saw Lu Ming sizing her up.</p><p>“Argh! What are you doing?”</p><p>Bai chixue was so shocked that she almost jumped up like a Frightened Rabbit.</p><p>“I didn’t do anything. I just happened to see you refining talismans, so I just took a few more glances!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Do you understand what I’m doing? You gave me such a big scare. You’re not allowed to hide behind me so sneakily in the future, or I’ll report you to shizun!”</p><p>Bai chixue patted her chest and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, I won’t peek anymore. By the way, where can i buy materials, treasures, spirit herbs, and the like? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You want to buy something? I don’t know!”</p><p>Bai chixue rolled her eyes and said.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>“Where did you get these materials?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“None of your business!”</p><p>Bai chixue pouted.</p><p>Lu Ming found it funny. This Bai chixue was really like a little girl. Was she deliberately making things difficult for him?</p><p>“I remember senior Bai Shijin telling you to take care of me, but you didn’t even tell me this. In that case, I can only send a voice transmission to senior Bai.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Wait, wait a moment!” Bai chixue was shocked. If Lu Ming had sent a voice transmission to Bai Shijin, she would probably be scolded again.</p><p>you can buy these things in the treasure Pavilion. Don’t ask me where I’m going, I don’t have time to take you. Here’s a map, take a look yourself!</p><p>Bai chixue had no choice but to take out a map and give it to Lu Ming. At the same time, she pouted her lips, cursing Lu Ming for not being a man and using her master to pressure her.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the map and took a look. He then kept it and smiled.”Many thanks, miss Bai!”</p><p>Having said that, he walked towards the main entrance. When he reached the main entrance, Lu Ming seemed to have thought of something. He stopped in his tracks and said, miss Bai, when you are refining the talisman scroll of the heavenly Fire sword, why don’t you lighten the blazing inscription on the one hundred and thirty-sixth line by two points and increase the sharpness inscription on the five hundred and sixty-fifth line by one point? also, delay the use of the Flint powder by five breaths, perhaps it would be better!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming strode out of the main door and headed towards the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Bai chixue was stunned for a second, then she snorted and mumbled, ” “You’re just pretending to know what you don’t know. Nonsense. How can it be that easy to refine the talisman scroll of the sky Fire godly sword? It’s fine as long as I modify a few places. I’m just not familiar with it yet. If I continue to practice more, I’ll definitely succeed!”</p><p>After that, Bai chixue continued to work on the scroll of the sky-fire godly sword.</p><p>But after that, she inscribed it twice in a row, both of which ended in failure. The talisman paper burned and turned into ashes.</p><p>“What’s going on? “Can’t I inscribe a class 7 Lv 6 inscription Rune Scroll?” If I can’t even inscribe a tier 7 Lv 6 inscription scroll, I’ll have no chance of getting any opportunities in the battle of Providence half a year later.”</p><p>Bai chixue frowned, feeling angry.</p><p>“Why don’t we try the method that guy mentioned?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words flashed across Bai chixue’s mind. She shook her head and thought, ” “That guy is probably just making things up. Why should I believe him?”</p><p>Although he thought this way, Lu Ming’s words still lingered in his mind.</p><p>what a detestable fellow. He’s deliberately disturbing my state of mind, right? Hmph, I’ll give it a try. If it doesn’t work, I’ll report this to master and have him driven out of Cloud Peak Residence!</p><p>“Eh, that’s right, I’m so smart!”</p><p>At the thought of using this method to chase Lu Ming out of Cloud Peak House, Bai chixue smiled happily again. She took out a piece of talisman paper and started to inscribe the sky-fire magical sword talisman scroll.</p><p>This time, she had followed Lu Ming’s instructions for the few key points.</p><p>His fingers trembled slightly, and inscriptions flew into the talisman paper, intertwining on the talisman paper to form a mysterious and beautiful picture.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a while, when Bai chixue finished the last inscription, the talisman paper started to shine. There was a faint sound of a sword, and a mysterious formation was shining on the talisman paper.</p><p>“Success … Did you succeed?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Her mouth was wide open as she stared at the scroll of the sky Fire magical sword in shock.</p><p>It was a success. She had never expected that according to Lu Ming’s method, it would actually succeed. She had successfully refined the sky Fire divine sword’s inscription scroll.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“Could it be that this fellow is a hidden expert?”</p><p>An idea flashed across Bai chixue’s mind, and she immediately shook her head and mumbled, ” “Impossible. I’ve seen all the geniuses of the talisman Amulet sect, but there’s no such person. Besides, which youth’s inscription techniques can compare to those of the talisman Amulet sect? That guy must have been lucky. He guessed right. Yes, he was lucky!”</p><p>Bai chixue gritted her teeth and found an excuse for herself.</p><p>Following that, she continued to make a few more, and all of them were successful. This made her a little dazed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
