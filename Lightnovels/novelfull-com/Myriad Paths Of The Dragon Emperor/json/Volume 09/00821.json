He should have been cultivating in seclusion, but now he had appeared.</p><p>...</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’ve been defeated, and now you’re looking for a beating again?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I lost in the Battle of the Kings, but what’s the big deal about losing in the king’s realm? The spiritual ocean tier is the realm where geniuses compete. Now, I can defeat you as easily as turning my hand!”</p><p>Wang Jue’s body emitted a burning aura.</p><p>On the other side, the people of the heavenly corpse sect watched with great interest.</p><p>They didn’t expect that the people of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would actually have an internal strife. They were naturally happy to see this happen.</p><p>Long Qianli frowned slightly. He recognized Lu Ming, but he had already helped Lu Ming and his group once. He could not interfere in their personal affairs every time.</p><p>After all, the other party was from an ancient family. Furthermore, his gaze was on Wang haoxian, who was standing behind Lu Ming.</p><p>He was very surprised. Why was Wang haoxian standing behind Lu Ming? if Wang haoxian were to make a move, he was not confident.</p><p>“Wang Jue, how about letting me have this person?”</p><p>Luan Fengyun looked at Wang Jue.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Wang Jue nodded. It would be best if Luan Fengyun could take care of Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed and blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>“If you want to touch Lu Ming, you’ll have to get past me first!”</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly.</p><p>“Wang haoxian, what are you doing?”</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>He had seen Wang haoxian just now. He was puzzled as to why Wang haoxian was with Lu Ming and the rest. He thought that they were on the same path.</p><p>“If you want to touch Lu Ming, you have to defeat me first!”</p><p>Wang haoxian continued to speak coldly.</p><p>This caused Luan Fengyun’s expression to turn even uglier.</p><p>Wang haoxian was a God-tier genius who had awakened a God-tier bloodline. How could he be a match for him?</p><p>“Wang haoxian, why are you doing this?”</p><p>Wang Jue said, his eyes filled with shock and bewilderment.</p><p>He was from the same clan as Wang haoxian. Wang haoxian was extremely arrogant, extremely talented, and focused on cultivation. He had never been nice to others, especially men.</p><p>Other than loving her brother Wang Haotian, she had almost no friends.</p><p>Now, she was standing in front of Lu Ming and helping him block the strong enemy.</p><p>This was a little unbelievable.</p><p>He was not the only one. The others were also in disbelief.</p><p>Many people who did not know Lu Ming were guessing who he was to be able to make the God-level prodigy, Wang haoxian, act this way.</p><p>Hmph! I’ll let you off today for the sake of Wang haoxian!</p><p>Said Luan Fengyun coldly. He then turned around to leave.</p><p>“Did I ask you to leave? Even if you didn’t look for me, I would have looked for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard. He took a step forward and said, ” Wang haoxian, there’s no need for you to interfere. I will settle this myself!</p><p>Luan Fengyun stopped and cast a glance at Wang haoxian. However, Wang haoxian took two steps back. He seemed to be very obedient to Lu Ming and had no intention of interfering.</p><p>This made many people feel surprised.</p><p>Luan Fengyun also frowned, and said,”Lu Ming, since you’re courting death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>With that, a powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>The peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>It was clear that chaotic wind cloud had also made great progress in the past six months, and had advanced by a level.</p><p>A large bow appeared in his hand, and the aura around him became sharp.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He retreated and nocked an arrow on his bow. An arrow pierced through space and shot towards Lu Ming. It was as fast as lightning and as powerful as Thunder.</p><p>Many people were secretly shocked. As expected of a quasi-heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents, Luan Fengyun’s combat strength was extremely powerful. Not many people of the same level could avoid this arrow.</p><p>Xie nianqing, fatty, and the others didn’t move at all. They didn’t seem worried at all.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move and allowed the arrows to hit him.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had not reacted at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was going to die. Many people had this thought.</p><p>The arrow tore through the air and arrived in front of Lu Ming’s glabella in an instant. At this moment, Lu Ming finally moved. He stretched out his hand. Not many people could see when he reached out and caught the arrow. The arrow stopped firmly in front of Lu Ming’s glabella, less than an inch away from it.</p><p>Almost everyone widened their eyes in shock. Lu Ming had actually caught the arrow with his bare hands.</p><p>This wasn’t an arrow shot by an ordinary person, but by Luan Fengyun. An arrow shot by Luan Fengyun, who had reached the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, was absolutely terrifying and could kill an ordinary expert at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>However, Lu Ming casually grabbed it in his hand.</p><p>This kind of visual impact was really too great, making people’s minds go into a daze.</p><p>“Luan Fengyun, it’s been half a year since we last met, and you haven’t improved at all!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He exerted force with his fingers and the arrow in his hand shattered.</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s pupils contracted, and he quickly retreated. At the same time, he drew his bow again.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine arrows were shot in a straight line. The arrows from the back hit the arrows in front, causing the speed of the arrows in front to increase dramatically. The speed of the first arrow was even more terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took a step forward and struck out with his palm. The arrow was shattered into pieces.</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s heart was filled with shock, and he frantically retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and appeared in front of Luan Fengyun in an instant. Terrified, Luan Fengyun exploded with all his might. A saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and the saber shattered. Lu Ming’s claws grabbed onto Luan Fengyun’s throat.</p><p>The quintessential essence in Luan Fengyun’s body had been completely sealed. He was struggling in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>The crowd was shocked beyond words. Luan Fengyun was a quasi-heaven’s chosen and was incomparably powerful. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he was like a little chick, unable to withstand a single blow. All of Lu Ming’s attacks were easily dispersed and nullified.</p><p>A few people who knew about the battle at the hundred venerated mountains were even more shocked.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming was completely suppressed by Luan Fengyun and was no match for him.</p><p>However, only half a year had passed and Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased to a terrifying level. He could completely suppress Luan Feng Yun. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>The two young men shouted from behind chaotic wind cloud and attacked Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s kick contained the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. The two youths were at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, but they were not prodigies and were far inferior to Lu Ming. They both spat out mouthfuls of blood and retreated.</p><p>A ray of light appeared on Lu Ming’s finger and he slashed it.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered in all directions. One of Luan Fengyun’s arms flew out and was cut off by Lu Ming.</p><p>Luan Fengyun let out a low growl, and his body began to struggle with all his might.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and threw Luan Fengyun away.</p><p>this arm will be used to repay you for that sneak attack. If you’re not convinced, you can come and fight me again!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Luan Fengyun bellowed in anger. He circulated his cultivation to stop the bleeding and looked at Lu Ming with some resentment and some shock.</p><p>On the other side, Wang Jue’s pupils contracted sharply, and his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Wang Jue’s combat strength was strong and his talent was amazing. Otherwise, he would not have been able to enter the Heavenly King ranking.</p><p>Once he broke through to the spirit ocean realm, his cultivation improved by leaps and bounds, and he was now at the peak of the fourth level of the spirit ocean realm. He originally thought that it would be enough to crush Lu Ming and take revenge for the day he was ranked on the Heavenly King ranking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
