Leave Di Yi to me!</p><p>...</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign glanced at nine suns Supreme and the others, then swung his axe at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>This axe could split the sky, as if it was going to split the entire ninedragons in half.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior. Fanatic, let’s go!”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang said as he and Yan kuangtu rushed to the side.</p><p>“You guys, stop those two Rascals!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi slashed out a shocking sword light to fight against the demonic sky sovereign. At the same time, he gave orders to the Supreme-beings of the six ancient families.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The six great Supremes responded and surrounded nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“You six are courting death!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu roared and launched a violent attack.</p><p>However, nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu had been injured during the battle with Martial Emperor Di Yi, so their combat strength was not as strong as before. They were blocked by the six Supremes and could not rush out at all.</p><p>“Today, none of you shall think of leaving!”</p><p>The Wang family was furious. He was severely injured by Lu Ming and almost died. It was a great humiliation. He could not wait to skin Lu Ming alive. How could he let Lu Ming leave in peace?</p><p>His attacks were the most frenzied, and he attacked nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu with no regard for his life.</p><p>“Oh, really? Explode!”</p><p>Hmph! nine suns Supreme Master suddenly snorted and controlled the Supreme shrine to crash toward the Wang family master.</p><p>During the collision, the Supreme shrine emitted a dazzling light and a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Ah, not good!”</p><p>The Wang clan master’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly retreated.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the Supreme God Hall exploded like a sun, and a terrifying energy swept out and drowned the Wang family head.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>arghh! the patriarch of the Wang family screamed as his body was sent flying thousands of miles away. His body was in tatters, and half of his body had exploded. He had almost died.</p><p>Tragic, too tragic.</p><p>Today, the Wang family’s master was almost killed by Lu Ming. After recovering a little, he was almost killed by the Supreme shrine’s explosion.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Nine yang Supreme Master and Yan kuangtu charged forward at top speed.</p><p>The Supreme shrine self-destructed and opened up a passage. The two of them brought Lu Ming and broke through the siege.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Yan kuangtu, who had transformed into the three-legged golden Crow, tore the space apart with his claws. He and the nine suns Supreme Master rushed into the space crack and disappeared.</p><p>“Chase, chase!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi was furious and roared.</p><p>The other five Supreme martial artists tore through space and chased after Yan kuangtu and the others.</p><p>Countless people in ninedragons were stunned.</p><p>The Supreme Master of nine suns and Yan kuangtu had fled with Lu Ming, but there were still two Imperial path experts fighting in the sky.</p><p>Today’s battle was destined to shake the entire East barren. Lu Ming’s name was bound to attract the attention of everyone in the East barren.</p><p>……</p><p>Three days later, a figure was sitting cross-legged on a mountain peak in the West of ninedragons. Another figure was constantly patting the former’s body, sending true energy into the former’s body.</p><p>A moment later, the second figure stopped.</p><p>The two figures were Lu Ming and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged while Yan kuangtu healed him.</p><p>After nearly three days of traveling, they had finally shaken off the five family heads of the ancient families. Yan kuangtu was there to treat Lu Ming’s injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a black bead flew out. Then, the remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme flew out from the bead.</p><p>At this moment, the remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme Master was extremely weak, as if it would dissipate at any moment.</p><p>“How is Lu Ming?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns asked.</p><p>“Master, Lu Ming’s injuries are very serious. However, after I treated his injuries, he’s much better. He should be waking up soon.”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes. The environment in front of him stunned him.</p><p>Wasn’t he in ninedragons? Nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu were fighting with Martial Emperor Di Yi, but it was calm here. There were no signs of a battle.</p><p>Then, he saw Yan kuangtu and the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, big brother Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see nine suns cosmos and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>This battle had started because of him, but it had also implicated nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu. If something had happened to nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu, he would not have been at ease. However, seeing that both of them were here, he could finally put down the stone in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how are you feeling? You’ve been unconscious for three days.”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“You’ve been unconscious for three days?”</p><p>“I’m already feeling much better!” Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, what is this place? Could it be that he’s no longer in ninedragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He was very curious. At that time, Martial Emperor Di Yi had attacked, so it would have been difficult for nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu to escape.</p><p>Perhaps, something else had happened after he fell unconscious!</p><p>yes, this place is not in ninedragons. It’s extremely far away from ninedragons. We’re almost out of the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!</p><p>that’s right! Yan kuangtu nodded. this time, it’s all thanks to the help of the demonic sky Emperor. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to escape from Di Yi!</p><p>the demonic sky sovereign is the legendary sovereign path expert? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked. He did not understand why the demonic Sky King would help him. Could it be that he was a helper invited by the nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu?</p><p>that’s right. It’s that senior. His disciple seems to be your brother. That’s why the devil Sky Emperor came to your rescue.</p><p>Supreme martial artist ninesuns explained.</p><p>“My brother?” Lu Ming was even more surprised.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space in the sky suddenly split open.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“It should be senior mo Tian!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>It was obvious that they had already contacted each other.</p><p>Sure enough, a few figures stepped out of the spatial crack.</p><p>One of the elders was the demonic sky sovereign. Beside him were two young men, a man and a woman.</p><p>“Fatty, Tingting!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see the two young people.</p><p>The two young men were fatty and ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Lu Ming, haha, are you alright?”</p><p>The fatty grinned and flew toward Lu Ming. “I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He finally knew who his brother was. It had to be fatty. He had never thought that Fatty’s master would be the legendary Devil Sky sovereign.</p><p>junior pays his respects to senior mo Tian. This time, I thank senior mo Tian for helping me!</p><p>Yan kuangtu, the Supreme Master of the nine suns, stepped forward and saluted the devil Sky Emperor to express his gratitude.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Thank you for your help, senior mo Tian!”</p><p>Lu Ming also went forward to bow.</p><p>you don’t have to be so polite. If it weren’t for my unfilial disciple, I wouldn’t have bothered to attack. I’ve offended Di Yi for no reason!</p><p>The devil Sky King said as he curled his lips.</p><p>Old man, are you afraid of Martial Emperor Di Yi? ” he asked.</p><p>The fatty pouted and looked at the devil Sky King.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme, Yan kuangtu, Lu Ming, and ruan Tingting’s eyes twitched, and they almost bit their tongues.</p><p>Old man who won’t die?</p><p>The fatty actually called the devil Sky Emperor that?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
