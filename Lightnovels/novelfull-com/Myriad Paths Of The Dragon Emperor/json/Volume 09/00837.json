Although their cultivation levels were low, they chose to stand by Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>...</p><p>Looking at fatty, ruan Tingting, and the rest, Lu Ming felt warm in his heart.</p><p>Xie nianqing was the same. She had always been eccentric, but now her eyes were red.</p><p>good, good, a group of lowly ants dare to block a chariot with their Mantis arms. They are overestimating themselves. Today, I will kill them all!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Eighth prince, there’s no need for you to kill them. Just leave it to us!”</p><p>With a flash, the man and woman who had come with Xie Zhen appeared beside him. One of the women asked.</p><p>that’s good. You can do it, but I’ve changed my mind. I won’t kill them yet. I’ll cripple their cultivation first. I’ll bring them back to the central continent and sell them to the land of barbarians as slaves!</p><p>Xie Zhen coldly said.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The man and woman responded.</p><p>Xie Zhen retreated. Following that, two sword hums were heard. One was black and the other was white. Two rays of sword light were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fatty, you guys retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and stepped forward, striking out with his palms twice.</p><p>With two loud bangs, the sword light collapsed. The man and woman’s expressions changed drastically. They shouted and their sword Qi increased dramatically.</p><p>The two of them were both experts at the peak of the sixth level spiritual ocean tier. Furthermore, they had awakened third level divine rank bloodlines.</p><p>It was a pity that they were a step too late. They did not witness the power of Lu Ming’s attack and had no idea how terrifying he was.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier. They thought that with the two of them joining forces, it would be more than enough to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they realized that they were wrong. Lu Ming’s combat strength was terrifying.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his palm continuously striking out. The black and white sword gleam was shattered, and the two of them quickly retreated.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>The two of them roared in anger. Two huge swords, one black and one white, appeared above their heads. Three golden chakras curled around the two huge swords.</p><p>The two of them merged with the giant sword, and the sword howled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black and white giant sword slashed at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a faint Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. His aura surged, and dense scales appeared on the surface of his skin. A violent aura burst out like a beast.</p><p>Scales appeared on Lu Ming’s hands as well. Even his nails had become long, like dragon claws.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His hands turned into claws and he grabbed the black and white swords.</p><p>As the sword aura whistled, Lu Ming firmly grabbed the blades of the two giant swords. The two giant swords trembled violently, but they could not fly out of his hands for the time being.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and exerted force with his claws. With two clangs, the black and white giant sword was crushed by Lu Ming and turned back into human form. The two figures, a man and a woman, flew far away and fell heavily on the ground, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>At this moment, countless people widened their eyes as they looked at Lu Ming and the scales on his body.</p><p>“What’s going on? What was with Lu Ming’s scale armor? He’s like a demon. Could it be that he’s not a human, but a demon?”</p><p>that’s impossible. He’s cultivating martial arts and has comprehended the will of heaven and earth. He’s definitely a human.</p><p>that should be some kind of secret technique. There are many mysterious secret techniques in the world that can make people transform into beasts, even completely into the shape of a beast. There are even some!</p><p>“That’s right. It should be a secret skill. What a terrifying secret skill. Lu Ming didn’t even cast it just now. It turns out that Lu Ming still has a trump card!”</p><p>The paragons of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley all widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming had not used his full strength in the battle against the sky demon Valley’s Paragon.</p><p>How powerful was Lu Ming, a prodigy who had awakened a second level divine level bloodline?</p><p>The coldness in Xie Zhen’s eyes became even more intense. He glanced at the man and woman and berated, ” you’re really trash. I even have to take action personally!</p><p>With that, Xie Zhen strode towards Lu Ming. With every step he took, the aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>In the distance, black wind Knight and the elder from the ancient Saint dynasty watched silently. They did not make a sound, nor did they stop him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful. He has awakened a fifth level divine level Blood Meridian!”</p><p>Xie nianqing reminded her softly.</p><p>“B * tch, so what if you remind me?”</p><p>Xie Zhen shouted coldly. A burly man in golden armor appeared above his head. This burly man was a hundred meters tall and looked like a god. He was holding a golden spear in his hand.</p><p>The burly man in golden armor was surrounded by five dazzling golden chakras.</p><p>Divine level rank 5 bloodline.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man in golden armor held a long spear in his hand. He looked down from above and smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Before the long spear even reached him, the terrifying pressure had already completely exploded.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the seventh level spiritual ocean tier. With such a cultivation, fusing with a fifth level divine level bloodline was too powerful and too terrifying.</p><p>One could imagine how terrifying aokun’s battle power was when he was at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm. Xie Zhen definitely wouldn’t be weaker than aokun in a battle of the same level. It could be seen how terrifying his battle power was.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar rang out from within Lu Ming’s body once again. Lu Ming had also unleashed the second wave of dragon energy.</p><p>The two Dragon powers exploded at the same time, and the power multiplied.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his feet and his body soared into the sky. He used the prison-suppressing heaven technique and punched the huge golden spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The terrifying vibrations formed sound waves that spread out like a storm.</p><p>The faces of those with weaker cultivations changed drastically, and their eardrums were almost burst from the vibrations. They quickly circulated their cultivation to resist.</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood. The fatty beside her quickly supported her and released his Zhen Yuan to help her block the terrifying sound wave.</p><p>In the sky, the huge spear vibrated and hummed. The huge body of the Golden-armored man actually trembled and took a step back.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This step caused the space to ripple like water. The air was compressed into liquid and blasted onto the fighting ring below, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body only took a step back.</p><p>“Damn it, you lowly ant, die!”</p><p>Xie Zhen, who had executed the blood fusion, was actually forced back by Lu Ming’s punch. He let out an angry roar.</p><p>“Demon-suppressing divine fist!”</p><p>The burly man in golden armor roared. The long spear in his hand disappeared, and a huge fist blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele appeared above Lu Ming’s head. He used blood fusion to merge his body with the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>At the moment of fusion, the two Dragon powers were also integrated into the prison-guarding stele, making it stronger than before.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele enlarged and pressed toward the Golden-armored man.</p><p>The Golden-armored burly man’s terrifying fist radiance was also aimed at the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying tremor exploded in the sky. Even from thousands of miles away, one could hear the shocking fluctuations.</p><p>Dozens of explosions sounded in succession.</p><p>In the beginning, the two were evenly matched, but everyone was shocked to find that as the number of attacks increased, the size of the prison-suppressing stele became larger and larger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
