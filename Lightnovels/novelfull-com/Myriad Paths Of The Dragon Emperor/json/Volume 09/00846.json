The head of the Wang family is a Supreme martial artist. As long as a Martial Emperor doesn’t show up, a Supreme martial artist is invincible. Even if Lu Ming can control the two Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons, they’re still external objects. How can he fight against a Supreme martial artist? ”</p><p>...</p><p>“That’s right. This brat can actually control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. After we capture him, we must ask him about the secret within. If the experts of my empyrean heaven divine Palace, or even his Majesty the Martial Emperor, can control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, how powerful will it be? Wouldn’t he be able to sweep through the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley?”</p><p>“Indeed, this secret must be revealed!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings said coldly, especially the disciples of the Wang family, Jiang family, and other ancient families.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Fatty, ruan Tingting, and a few others appeared in the crowd. They had finally rushed over, but when they saw the scene of Lu Ming fighting against the Supreme-being, they were shocked and worried.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, even with the help of the divine cauldron, how could he fight against a Supreme-being?</p><p>“Old fart, you must call the old fart over!”</p><p>Fatty’s throat kept letting out low growls.</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is indeed wonderful. But today, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron can’t protect you!</p><p>The master of the Wang family strode forward with a ten-thousand-meter long flaming sword in his hand. He slashed at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming could only use the two cauldrons to resist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion sounded. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>The power of a Supreme Being was too powerful. An ordinary spiritual God powerhouse was far inferior to it.</p><p>“The power of the divine cauldron is an external force, after all. How much of its power can you unleash? With this, you want to contend with this seat? a Mantis trying to stop a chariot, putting up a stubborn resistance!”</p><p>The leader of the Wang family was like a Purple Sun, floating in the sky. He gave off a burning aura, but his voice was cold. As he spoke, he stepped forward and raised his flame sword again.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons let out a long roar, and the blood Qi in its body spread. It spat out another mouthful of blood, which was absorbed by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two divine cauldrons trembled. In the next moment, the sky suddenly darkened. Everyone watched in shock as another cauldron descended and pressed down on the Wang clan master.</p><p>The third cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually summoned three cauldrons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The third cauldron flew toward the Wang family master and was sent flying by a single sword strike.</p><p>The huge cauldron flew towards Lu Ming and trembled slightly. It emitted a radiance that seemed to resonate with the previous two cauldrons. The aura that the cauldron emitted seemed to be stronger.</p><p>It was as if the more divine cauldrons there were, the more powerful they would be when they combined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The divine cauldron shook and left Lu Ming’s palm. It started to spin around Lu Ming.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was wrapped around the first cauldron and was suspended above Lu Ming’s head. The other two cauldrons were suspended and spinning around Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a huge cauldron flew out, pressing down on the Wang family master.</p><p>The Wang family master’s eyes turned serious as he slashed out with his flame sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The divine cauldron was knocked back, but Lu Ming waved his hand again. Another divine cauldron flew out and suppressed the Wang family master.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons pressed toward the master of the Wang family.</p><p>The master of the Wang family kept waving his sword. Shocking sword radiance was unleashed as he fought against the three cauldrons.</p><p>However, he couldn’t win for the time being.</p><p>This scene was too shocking. Lu Ming could actually summon three Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons and fight to a draw with the master of the Wang family. This was too unbelievable, like a fantasy story.</p><p>Moreover, many people thought of another point. There were nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons in total. Since Lu Ming could summon three, could he summon more? How terrifying would that power be?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As if to confirm everyone’s guess, the heavens and earth trembled as yet another massive being descended from the sky. Its target was the Wang clan head.</p><p>The master of the Wang family’s pupils contracted. With a long roar, a wisp of purple flame floated above his head. On the purple flame, there were six golden chakra.</p><p>The Wang clan’s clan head had a terrifying divine level rank 6 bloodline.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family merged with his bloodline and turned into a ball of purple flame. The purple flame changed again and turned into a giant purple sword.</p><p>When a Supreme-being used bloodline fusion, the power would reach a terrifying level. With a wave of his purple sword, he sent a divine cauldron flying.</p><p>However, the other two cauldrons continued to press down.</p><p>With the addition of the divine cauldron, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s power was further enhanced. It continued to suppress the Wang family master, forming a stalemate.</p><p>this kid is demonic and can continuously summon divine cauldrons. I must suppress him quickly and not let him summon more divine cauldrons!</p><p>The Jiang family’s master said in a sonorous voice as he stepped forward.</p><p>He wanted to join forces with the master of the Wang family to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>To deal with one Lu Ming, two Supreme-beings had to join forces. It was like a dream.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The master of the Jiang family made his move. With a wave of his arm, he destroyed everything, even splitting the heaven and earth.</p><p>It was really split open. It was not just talk. Between heaven and earth, a hideous crack that was hundreds of miles long appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! An incomparably sharp glint slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He had no choice but to control a huge cauldron and blast it at the Jiang family’s master.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A huge cauldron was sent flying.</p><p>The master of the Jiang family did not stop. His gaze was as sharp as a divine sword. He stepped forward and closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dragon roars shook the heavens as the nine Dragons coughed out three mouthfuls of blood. The divine cauldron trembled and rumbled in the sky. At this moment, another huge cauldron came crashing down.</p><p>The fifth Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron descended.</p><p>The fifth Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron pressed toward the master of the Jiang family.</p><p>The Jiang family’s master let out a long roar. His aura was wild as he punched out with both fists, bombarding the two cauldrons and sending them flying.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out a mouthful of blood, his face pale.</p><p>The other party was a Supreme Being, after all. He had the divine cauldron to protect him, but he still felt immense pressure and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“What are you all waiting for? Are you going to wait for him to summon more Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons?”</p><p>The cold voice of the Jiang clan’s patriarch rang out as he glanced at the other four clan heads.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s capture this brat first!”</p><p>The master of the chaotic family said. He took a step forward, and his battle intent soared.</p><p>The remaining three people’s eyes flickered. Then, another person stepped out.</p><p>This man was the head of the Kong family, one of the ancient families.</p><p>They wanted to join forces and end the battle as soon as possible. Lu Ming was too monstrous and strange. They were really afraid that Lu Ming would summon the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons. If the nine divine cauldrons were gathered, who knew what would happen?</p><p>“You’re all Supreme martial artists, yet you’re actually teaming up to deal with a junior. Have you all lived your lives for nothing?”</p><p>kill! at this moment, an angry roar reverberated through the sky and earth, reverberating for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Who was it? He actually dared to scold the Supreme martial artists like this. Did he not want to live anymore?</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The next moment, the space in the sky cracked open, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>This figure seemed to be in his thirties. He held a wine gourd in his hand and gulped down a few mouthfuls of wine. He stood in front of the Masters of the Luan and Kong families, his eyes full of disdain.</p><p>“Yan kuangtu, it’s Yan kuangtu!”</p><p>“So it’s him, no wonder!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
