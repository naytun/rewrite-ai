He was rather fearful of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun, it won’t be that easy for you to defeat me. I don’t believe that your Dao of inscription is that powerful.”</p><p>Feng tai said in a low voice.</p><p>“Make your move, you’ll know once you try!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Feng tai didn’t say anything. He waved his hand, and twelve giant puppets appeared in front of him.</p><p>These were 12 giant wolves. Their bodies were completely black, and they emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>Six of them were at the tenth rank of Level 6, and the other six were at the peak of the ninth rank. Each of them was five meters tall and ten meters long. They looked like 12 giant monsters.</p><p>The 12 giant wolf puppets formed a large formation. They roared and pounced at Lu Ming, causing the fighting ring to rumble violently.</p><p>“This Feng tai should have lit up seven mind lamps at each level.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>An ordinary inscriber could control one or two puppets, and that was already impressive. Feng tai could control 12 powerful puppets at the same time, and he could even form a large array. His mind power must be very strong, far beyond that of an ordinary inscriber.</p><p>At the same time, his mastery of mental energy fire must have reached the peak of the subtle realm, or else he would have found it very difficult to do so.</p><p>In the past, the tribes that Lu Ming had encountered in the underground world were just superficial knowledge that Lian Cang had passed on to him. He did not understand the essence of the knowledge. In addition, the people in the underground world had limited talent and their mental energy fire was not strong. Their control of the mental energy fire was also very shallow. Usually, they could only control one puppet. Compared to the paragons of the talisman Amulet sect, they were far inferior.</p><p>Lu Ming put his hands behind his back and smiled faintly as he looked at the twelve puppets that were charging at him. He did not summon the puppets to fight the enemy, nor did he take out the inscription scrolls.</p><p>“What is tianyun trying to do? Could it be that he was going to rely on a temporary formation to fight against Feng Tai’s puppet battle formation? How is this possible?”</p><p>inscribing a formation in an instant can’t be of a very high level. It’s fine to use it against enemies with a great disparity in strength, but it’s a little too much to use it against Feng Tai’s puppet battle formation!</p><p>it’s hard to say. Tianyun has already reached the ‘heart limit’ realm, and his inscribing speed is unparalleled. He might be able to inscribe some powerful formations in an instant to resist Feng Tai’s puppet battle formation!</p><p>Seeing this situation, many people started to discuss.</p><p>Just as the puppet was about to reach Lu Ming, he took a light step forward.</p><p>A total of twelve formations appeared on the ground. The formations glowed, and a human figure condensed.</p><p>Lu Ming. All the figures condensed by the array were Lu Ming’s figures, which were exactly the same as him.</p><p>The surrounding people were dumbfounded.</p><p>“W-what kind of formation is this? How come I’ve never seen him before?”</p><p>“I’ve never even heard of it, let alone seen it!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Twelve Lu Ming’s figures appeared beside the twelve puppets. In a flash, they rushed towards the puppets and extended their palms to slap them.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Feng tai let out a low roar as he controlled his puppets to attack the twelve figures.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The twelve figures were extremely fragile. After being hit by the puppets, they immediately collapsed. However, before Feng tai could smile, the collapsed figures turned into runes that spread on the twelve puppets, forming a formation and entering the puppets ‘bodies.</p><p>“I don’t care what tricks you’re playing, take this!”</p><p>Feng tai growled and controlled the puppet to continue pouncing at Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming stood on the fighting ring with his hands behind his back. He really did not move at all, not even his feet.</p><p>“What is this tianyun trying to do? He didn’t move at all. Was he looking for death? Or are you planning to admit defeat?”</p><p>“At such a close distance, it’s already too late for him to inscribe a formation to resist. Has he really given up on the competition? does he know that he’s no match for Feng tai?”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with clamor.</p><p>“Tianyun, fight back!”</p><p>Below the stage, Bai chixue shouted with a worried look.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant wolf puppet howled and brandished its sharp claws, trying to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s over, this tianyun is finished! I don’t know what’s gotten into him, but he’s not fighting back, nor is he admitting defeat!”</p><p>Someone cried out in shock. Lu Ming did not admit defeat. Feng tai could continue to attack.</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest were also staring at the fighting ring without blinking. Their eyes were filled with doubt. They did not know what Lu Ming was planning.</p><p>“If you’re pretending to be mysterious, then you’ll be defeated!”</p><p>Feng Tai’s eyes were filled with madness and a hint of joy.</p><p>He could finally take revenge for what happened last time.</p><p>Just as the giant wolf puppets ‘claws were about to land on Lu Ming, the twelve giant wolf puppets suddenly stopped and froze in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eh? What was going on? Don’t tell me Feng tai showed mercy!”</p><p>“That must be it. Feng tai must have stopped the puppet when he saw that tianyun couldn’t fight back in time.”</p><p>Everyone guessed.</p><p>However, they didn’t see that Feng Tai’s expression had become very strange. It was filled with bewilderment, astonishment, and even shock.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The 12 giant wolf puppets howled and turned around one after another. They stood in front of Lu Ming and looked at Feng tai who was opposite them.</p><p>Many people were confused. This didn’t seem right.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>Then, the 12 giant wolf puppets roared and charged at Feng tai.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Feng tai let out a roar of disbelief. The blue light between his brows flickered, and the mental energy fire danced wildly. However, he discovered that he had completely lost control of the twelve puppets. It was as if his connection with the twelve puppets had been cut off.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Twelve huge puppets stepped on the battle stage and pounced towards him. He roared and waved his hands, inscribing a formation on the ground. Light flashed and the formation appeared.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was no longer able to stop the puppet’s iron hooves. In an instant, the formation he had inscribed was destroyed, and the giant wolf puppet’s huge claws grabbed at Feng tai.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Feng tai shouted.</p><p>The giant wolf puppet’s claw stopped on top of Feng Tai’s head.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>“This … What was going on? What the hell was going on? How did Feng Tai’s puppet end up being controlled by tianyun?”</p><p>I don’t know. What’s going on? ”</p><p>“Could it be the formation that Tian Yun carved earlier, the formation that condensed twelve bodies that were the same as him, that was the formation that controlled Feng Tai’s puppet?”</p><p>“What? There was actually such a formation in the world? How come I didn’t know about this?”</p><p>There was a clamor all around. Many people couldn’t control their emotions and cursed. The key was that the scene was too strange and amazing.</p><p>“This … What kind of formation is this?”</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin and du songjue looked at each other in a daze.</p><p>They had never heard of such a formation before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
