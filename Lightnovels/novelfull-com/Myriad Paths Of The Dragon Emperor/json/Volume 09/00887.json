He looked at the fifteen puppets with a calm expression.</p><p>...</p><p>The puppet was getting closer and closer to Lu Ming.</p><p>Countless people were looking at Lu Ming on the fighting ring. They knew that Lu Ming was going to use that move again.</p><p>Was that technique still effective against the assimilation of appearance?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on it. Very soon, they would know.</p><p>Just as the puppets were a few meters away from Lu Ming, he took a step forward and fifteen formations appeared on the ground. With a flash of light, fifteen figures that looked exactly like Lu Ming appeared. The moment they appeared, they pounced on the fifteen puppets.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As soon as a figure came into contact with a puppet, the figure would explode like a balloon and turn into wisps of inscriptions that spread over the puppet, forming a large array that entered the puppet.</p><p>“Come, I don’t believe you can cut off my connection with the puppet!”</p><p>Yan Tongtong’s eyes flickered, and the mental energy fire between his brows was dancing.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, the fifteen puppets came to a halt at the same time. They were not moving at all, and their heads were emitting a dazzling light.</p><p>Lu Ming was cutting off the connection between Yan Hua and the puppet.</p><p>“You want to cut off my mind fire? impossible!”</p><p>Yan Tongtong roared and stopped all his movements. A blue spiritual fire flickered between his brows, turning into invisible spiritual threads that connected the fifteen puppets.</p><p>Between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, there was a blue fire of blood essence that was jumping. He was using an array to cut off the connection between Yan Hua and the puppet.</p><p>However, Yan Tong’s psyche was much stronger than Feng Tai’s, and his use of psyche fire had reached the heart’s desire realm. His psyche was firm and unyielding, and it was more than ten times harder to cut it off than Feng tai.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he had encountered strong resistance.</p><p>“You can’t stop me!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The mental energy fire between his eyebrows burned even more vigorously, almost materializing.</p><p>His mental energy surged into the puppet’s head and acted on the formation. The puppet’s head flickered with dazzling light.</p><p>“I won’t lose!”</p><p>Yan Tongtong’s eyes were firm as he tried his best to resist. In the end, he even roared, and spiritual rings appeared above his head.</p><p>Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue. There were six spiritual rings. The first four rings had eight light spots on each of them. The green and blue spiritual rings behind them had seven light spots each.</p><p>This meant that Yan Tong had lit up eight lamps in the first four levels, while level five and level six had lit up seven lamps each.</p><p>If Yan Tong could not light up the eighth lamp of spirit at level six, then his next step would be to break through to Level Seven.</p><p>The first four levels lit up eight spirit lamps, while the fifth and sixth levels lit up seven. Such a result was already very impressive.</p><p>The spirit ring appeared, causing Yan Tong’s spirit energy to increase greatly. His spirit energy surged into the puppet like a tide.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The 15 puppets roared and their bodies trembled slightly, as if they were about to be controlled by Yan Tong again.</p><p>it seems like tianyun’s formation requires a powerful mental energy to cut off the connection between the puppet and the opponent!</p><p>At this time, the others also saw the secret behind it.</p><p>this is normal. Otherwise, if it can cut off the connection between others and the puppet at will and take the puppet for itself, then this kind of formation is too heaven-defying and unreasonable!</p><p>Many people nodded.</p><p>However, they were still staring at the fighting ring unblinkingly. They wanted to see if Lu Ming could successfully suppress Yan Tongtong. If he could not take Yan Tongtong’s puppet, they would have to fight him head-on. It would be hard to say who would win.</p><p>“Yan Tong Hua, you can’t block it!”</p><p>The smile on Lu Ming’s face grew wider. At this moment, his eyes seemed to be glowing with a blue light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, rings appeared above his head, spirit rings.</p><p>“Tianyun has released his Spirit Circle. Let’s see how many spirit lamps he has lit up. Wait, this, nest, f * ck, my eyes are blurry, my eyes are blurry, why do I see that the first five Rings all have 10 spirit lamps?”</p><p>“I … My eyes are also blurry. Damn, why are my eyes blurry? why did I see him light ten spirit lamps? can you help me see how many he lit?”</p><p>“I … The first five levels all had ten, and the sixth level had five.”</p><p>“What? Why did you see the same thing as me? Are your eyes playing tricks on you?”</p><p>“I saw the same thing!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>……</p><p>The scene was in a mess. Almost no one could believe what they had just seen, subconsciously thinking that their eyes were playing tricks on them.</p><p>However, when everyone gave the same answer, they were stunned.</p><p>The entire place fell into dead silence.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes and mouths opened wider and wider. They couldn’t help but feel like they were being sucked in by a gust of wind.</p><p>For the first five levels to have ten mind lamps lit up, that was too terrifying.</p><p>He had achieved perfection in all of them. Was he still human? In the tens of thousands of years of Talisman Amulet Sect history, the only person who could achieve such results was Emperor Liao Cang.</p><p>Now, there was one more.</p><p>As for the sixth level, there were only five light spots. That was because Lu Ming had yet to reach the peak of this level.</p><p>God, this was simply a monster.</p><p>It was no wonder that the leaders of the two sects and the elders would let Lu Ming become a zongzi candidate. With such talent, wasn’t it normal for him to become a zongzi candidate?</p><p>In the crowd, Xu RI, Guan Rong, Feng tai, and the others who had been beaten up by Lu Ming were all tongue-tied and stood there in a daze, completely speechless.</p><p>It turned out that their enemy was such a monster. At this moment, they were secretly glad that they were still alive. They were on a completely different level from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Forget it, it’s not wise to be enemies with such a monster!”</p><p>Sunrise shook his head and sighed. He had thought of taking revenge on Lu Ming in the future but now, he had completely given up on that thought.</p><p>Feng tai, Guan Rong, and the other heaven’s favorites also shook their heads and sighed. They admitted that they were unlucky. Who asked them to be blind?</p><p>Ji mai, Meng Jia, and H Ming all widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“It’s not an injustice that I lost to him!” H Ming laughed.</p><p>On the other side, Bai chixue’s little mouth was wide open.</p><p>“This fellow has kept me in the dark for so long!”</p><p>Bai chixue thought.</p><p>Many of the talisman Amulet sect’s elders, who did not know about this beforehand, were also shocked to the extreme.</p><p>They looked at Bai Shijin and the rest who were smiling in the sky. They finally understood that the elders had long known about Lu Ming’s talent.</p><p>On the fighting stage, Yan Tongtong was even more shocked and dumbfounded. Even his spiritual ring was shaking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mental energy gushed out like a tsunami and surged into the puppets. Yan Tongtong was shocked. How could he resist it? Lu Ming cut off the connection between him and the puppets. The 15 puppets were completely under Lu Ming’s control.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
