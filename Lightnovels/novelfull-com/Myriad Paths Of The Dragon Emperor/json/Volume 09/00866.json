How is he qualified to be a zongzi candidate? damn it!”</p><p>...</p><p>The rising sun shouted.</p><p>Becoming a zongzi candidate had been Sunrise’s dream. He had been working hard for it, but now, it had been taken over by a stranger. He was so jealous that he wanted to go crazy.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Talisman Amulet sect was in a state of confusion.</p><p>Who was tianyun? Where did he come from? What qualifications did he have to ascend to the throne of a zongzi candidate?</p><p>The eyes of the chosen gleamed with a sharp light.</p><p>This was especially true for the top 300 God-grade talents on the list of top 1000 talents. People of their level were all competing for the zongzi position. How could they be convinced that a young man from the mo Shang sect would be the one to take it?</p><p>I’d like to see how capable this tianyun is to become a zongzi candidate.</p><p>“Go, find out more about this person called tianyun.”</p><p>Everyone in the yin and yang mountain was shocked by the name ‘tianyun’.</p><p>In the cloud Peak House, Bai chixue looked at the voice transmission jade talisman in her hand in a daze. Then, she glared at Lu Ming for a long time before she said, ” you still said that you’re not master’s illegitimate son. Now, you’re a zongzi candidate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s forehead was full of black lines. What was this!</p><p>“It can’t be that everyone has been notified, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>almost all the talisman sect disciples in Mount Liangyi have received the news!</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose.</p><p>Was there a need to make such a big scene? Lu Ming knew that there would be a lot of trouble.</p><p>“These guys are just looking for trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>He understood that Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others had done this on purpose. It was equivalent to giving him an indirect challenge. He was a stranger who had suddenly appeared and was appointed as a zongzi candidate. How could those geniuses accept this? they would definitely find trouble with him.</p><p>This was the test.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll deal with it as it comes. At most, I’ll just go into seclusion and not come out!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a headache.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of those people, but he was afraid of trouble.</p><p>“Hey, you still haven’t answered me. Are you really master’s illegitimate child?”</p><p>Bai chixue opened her eyes wide and kept asking. She was very curious.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. can you stop making wild guesses? I didn’t cultivate in the talisman Amulet sect in the past.</p><p>“Not cultivating in the talisman Amulet sect? Then where do you cultivate? the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Bai chixue asked curiously.</p><p>“Almost!” Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Really? you’re really cultivating in the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? Do you know Lu Ming?”</p><p>Bai chixue became excited and asked a few questions.</p><p>“I don’t know him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly denied it.</p><p>“You don’t know Lu Ming? “Hmph, you’re really ignorant. You don’t even know Lu Ming. In the battle of ninedragons, Lu Ming pulled out the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and fought against three Supreme Masters. It is said that one of the Supreme Masters was almost killed by him. Even Martial Emperor Di Yi took action. How can you not know such a person?” He’s my idol now!”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming in disdain and then looked at the sky with a starry-eyed expression.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little confused.</p><p>“A hero like Lu Ming is the true unparalleled prodigy in my heart. He’s comparable to the top 10 on the list of top 1000 talents. Sunrise and the others are far behind him. Tianyun, you’re not bad, but you’re still far behind Lu Ming. Keep working hard!”</p><p>Bai chixue patted Lu Ming’s shoulder, giving him a look that said, ” you have to work hard.</p><p>“This … I’ll try harder, try harder …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>At this moment, an elder of the talisman Amulet sect arrived and Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>This old man was here to give Lu Ming the token that represented the zongzi candidate.</p><p>With this token, Lu Ming could enter most of the places in the talisman Amulet sect at will, except for some important forbidden areas.</p><p>For the next two days, Mount Liangyi was bustling with activity. Everyone was talking about the same name-tianyun.</p><p>However, none of the paragons were looking for trouble with Lu Ming. They seemed to be waiting for someone else to make the first move and test the waters.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming left Yun Peak House and headed to the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The seven days were up. He went to collect the demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>“Tianyun, that’s tianyun!”</p><p>Lu Ming was recognized the moment he arrived at the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>“He’s tianyun? He’s so young. What kind of abilities does he have to be appointed as a zongzi candidate?”</p><p>“You don’t know? However, there was probably something outstanding about it. Otherwise, why would the elders agree to this?”</p><p>“I imagine that he might be a disciple secretly trained by one of the doyens. He’s only appearing now that the war of karmic luck is upon us.”</p><p>“It’s possible!”</p><p>The surroundings were abuzz with discussion.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming curiously. Some of them were kind, but most of them were jealous.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored their gazes and went to the counter that he had visited previously.</p><p>“Young master, you’re tianyun?”</p><p>The young lady at the counter widened her eyes and looked at Lu Ming with a curious look.</p><p>“If there’s no one else, then it’s me. Beauty, have you gathered all the demonic beast blood essence?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s all here, take a look!” He said.</p><p>The young woman handed Lu Ming a storage ring. Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his mind to confirm that it was correct.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming paid the two thousand five hundred raw gemstones, kept the demonic beast blood essence, and walked out.</p><p>“Tianyun, stop!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard and two figures blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>“Xushan!”</p><p>Lu Ming could see at a glance that one of them was Xu Shan.</p><p>The other person looked similar to Xu Shan, and his eyes were sharp.</p><p>it’s the rising sun. It looks like the rising sun can’t hold back and is going to make the first move!</p><p>that’s for sure. All the heaven’s favorites are watching. Someone has to make the first move. Xushan was beaten up by tianyun a few days ago, and the rising sun has been pursuing Bai chixue. It’s reasonable for them to make the first move!</p><p>“I can finally see how extraordinary this tianyun is!”</p><p>The treasure Pavilion was abuzz with discussion. Everyone’s eyes were shining as they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“So this is the rising sun!” Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve finally dared to appear. Let’s see where you can run off to today!”</p><p>Xu Shan said coldly, glaring at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>Back then, he was slapped twice by Lu Ming in public and now he was reduced to a joke. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is your face going to swell again?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Xu Shan. Xu Shan’s expression changed and he retreated slightly.</p><p>Hmph, tianyun, I’d like to see what you’re capable of to beat up my brother. Live in the cloud Peak Residence and become a zongzi candidate!</p><p>&Nbsp; rising sun stepped forward, a blue light flashing between his brows, and a massive amount of spiritual energy spreading out.</p><p>“You want your face to swell too?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the rising sun.</p><p>Sunrise’s expression turned ugly, and an even more violent spiritual power spread out from between his brows, stirring up a spiritual storm in the hall.</p><p>“No fighting in the treasure Pavilion!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from one of the rooms, followed by a powerful mental energy. Everyone felt a mountain-like pressure on them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
