You’ve managed to train that violent woman, Wang haoxian, to be so obedient. I’m impressed!</p><p>...</p><p>Fatty had touched a sore spot.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shrieked. A powerful aura burst out of his body and the sky demon force field enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He moved his body and penetrated the heavy force field. He appeared beside Xie nianqing and wrapped his arm around Xie nianqing’s waist. Xie nianqing’s body trembled and the force field disappeared.</p><p>“Silly girl, can’t you tell that she did it on purpose? I only have you in my heart. How can Wang haoxian touch my heart?”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered in Xie nianqing’s ear.</p><p>This action was really intimate.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked around and saw fatty, Qiao Xuan, and Wang haoxian staring at them with wide eyes. His face turned red and he struggled, ” “Lu Ming, you … You … Let me go!”</p><p>“If you don’t believe me, I won’t let go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“I … I believe in you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing admitted defeat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arm then loosened. Xie nianqing struggled and flew out, his face red.</p><p>haha, the weather’s pretty good today. Don’t you think so, sister Qiao Xuan? ”</p><p>Fatty laughed and turned to look elsewhere.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I am!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan also turned in another direction.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned even redder and he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, looked at Xie nianqing with a smile.</p><p>After the banter, the few of them started chatting.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin had some fortuitous encounters in the sky Dome relic. Their cultivation had reached the peak fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and their comprehension of concepts had far surpassed Lu Ming’s.</p><p>However, just like Lu Ming, their third bloodline had not been awakened yet. It seemed to be still accumulating.</p><p>“Now, you’re no match for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Hmph, don’t be so smug. When I awaken my third bloodline, I’ll definitely defeat you!</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and pouted.</p><p>Especially when he looked at Wang haoxian, his eyes were extremely unfriendly, as if he was still brooding over it.</p><p>“Hey, someone’s coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked into the distance.</p><p>A sword light cut through the void at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived before him. The sword light dissipated, and a beautiful woman appeared.</p><p>“Tingting!”</p><p>The fatty was overjoyed when he saw the woman and hurriedly went up to her.</p><p>This young woman was ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Fatty, Lu Ming, miss nianqing, I didn’t expect you to be here!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was overjoyed to see Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Tingting, long time no see!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also greeted ruan Tingting.</p><p>After not seeing each other for half a year, ruan Tingting had already pulled through that period of sadness. There was a heroic spirit on her body, making her look heroic and cool.</p><p>“Tingting, aren’t you cultivating in Di Tian’s royal guards? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Fatty asked.</p><p>I came here with big brother long Qianli. Recently, the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley have sent their geniuses to ninedragons to challenge the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. There are geniuses from the heavenly corpse sect blocking the entrance of a Holy Land on the Dragon vein in the East. They are very arrogant, so big brother long Qianli wanted to meet them, so I followed them. I’ll also go to the wind sword sect to avenge my parents!</p><p>Ruan Tingting explained.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect and the geniuses of the heavenly demon Valley are all here?”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest were stunned.</p><p>yes, I heard that the most powerful group of future geniuses, such as the heavenly corpse sect, sent the sovereigns ranked below the 100th on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>this is normal. Before every battle of Kismet, the Overlord forces will send their geniuses to each other’s territory. The purpose is to test the strength of each other’s geniuses. In the past, the Empyrean divine Palace also sent their geniuses to the heavenly corpse sect. This time, the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley have come together.</p><p>Said Wang haoxian. She was a genius of the Wang clan and knew the situation better.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was understandable.</p><p>Although the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect were mortal enemies, they didn’t kill the envoys. When the other party’s geniuses came, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace could only send their geniuses to face the enemy.</p><p>Tingting, let’s go to the wind sword sect first. After we deal with them, we’ll go take a look together.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He also wanted to see the strength of the heavenly corpse sect’s paragons.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting nodded.</p><p>The group of them then headed towards the wind sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that ruan Tingting’s cultivation had already reached the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>It was obvious that ruan Tingting had been heavily nurtured in the Ditian royal guards for the past six months. In addition to the inheritance of Blue Gold supremacy, her cultivation had progressed so quickly.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming and the rest were not together to help ruan Tingting take revenge. Back then, Lu Ming had said that he would let ruan Tingting take revenge herself.</p><p>They were going together to prevent any accidents.</p><p>Soon, the wind sword sect’s Mountain Gate came into view.</p><p>“Who’s there? This is the wind sword sect, stop right there!”</p><p>At the wind sword sect’s Mountain Gate, the disciples guarding the mountain shouted.</p><p>“Don’t you guys recognize me?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting strode forward with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, you’re ruan Tingting!”</p><p>The expression of the disciples guarding the mountain changed drastically.</p><p>“I won’t kill you, go get old man ye fa, come out and face your death!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“You … Just you wait!”</p><p>The disciple turned around and ran away.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a while, urgent bell chimes came from the wind sword sect. Then, a large number of figures appeared in the depths of the wind sword sect.</p><p>Ye fa, Ye Qing, and a few elders from the wind sword sect.</p><p>However, they stopped in the depths of the wind sword sect and did not walk out.</p><p>Ye FA’s eyes swept across them and said, ” Tingting, what happened back then was our fault. However, because of this, the wind sword sect’s patriarch died in battle. A few other experts also died. Qing ‘er’s cultivation was also crippled. Can we just let this matter end? ”</p><p>shut up! Don’t call my name. End it? sure, but I’ll end it after I cut off your head!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said coldly, her killing intent extremely thick.</p><p>During this period of time, she had been cultivating with all her might, hoping that one day, she would be able to charge into the wind sword sect and avenge her parents. How could this matter be easily resolved?</p><p>Ye FA’s eyes were cold, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Since you’re not coming out, I’ll kill my way in!”</p><p>As soon as ruan Tingting finished speaking, the sound of a sword rang out. A blue sword Qi soared into the sky. As the sword Qi crisscrossed, ruan Tingting strode forward.</p><p>“Third level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Ye fa and the others ‘expressions changed. They were in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the surroundings and a cold smile appeared on his face.”Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>Then, they followed ruan Tingting and stepped out.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming and the rest had entered the wind sword sect’s territory, ye FA’s eyes turned cold. His killing intent flashed as he shouted, ” “Great formation, rise!”</p><p>Then, dense runes appeared all over the mountains and plains of the wind sword sect. Streaks of sword Qi condensed in the air, and a powerful pressure permeated the air.</p><p>This was a killing formation, a level-six killing formation, and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming and the others had caused a huge commotion in the hundred venerates mountain. In the end, ruan Tingting had been taken away by the DI Tian Imperial Guards. Naturally, ye fa had heard about it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
