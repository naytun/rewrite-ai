But he has his limit, and now he has reached it. I bet he has reached the end and can’t find the next array!</p><p>...</p><p>The person who had spoken earlier immediately spoke again, winning the approval of the crowd.</p><p>that’s right. Seventy-six should be his limit. However, it’s already terrifying. I don’t think Ji mai and the others can exceed this number!</p><p>“I didn’t expect that tianyun’s eyes would be so sharp.”</p><p>Many people sighed and discussed.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at his surroundings in surprise.</p><p>The reason he stopped wasn’t because he couldn’t find it, but because he suddenly felt eyes on him from all directions. He was surprised, so he stopped.</p><p>At this time, he looked around and saw that there was nothing. Lu Ming looked at the picture again, stretched out his finger and pointed.</p><p>The three combat swords slashed out and then disappeared in the air.</p><p>Another array was found. Then, Lu Ming started to point at it at a uniform speed.</p><p>The 78th, 79th, 80th …</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming had found more than eighty arrays and the number was still increasing.</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded.</p><p>The person who had spoken earlier almost bit his tongue, and his face turned red.</p><p>He had just said with certainty that Lu Ming had reached his limit and it was impossible to find the next one. However, he was immediately slapped in the face and he felt his face burning.</p><p>“How many can he find?”</p><p>I don’t know. Tianyun’s speed has always been constant. I can’t guess!</p><p>it’s said that there are a total of 99 formations on a painting. He won’t find all of them, will he? ”</p><p>that shouldn’t be possible. In history, there are very few people who could find all the formations. Even those Supreme-beings didn’t have this skill when they were young!</p><p>The discussion continued without stopping.</p><p>Ji mai, Meng Jia, and the rest all stopped and stared at Lu Ming. At this moment, they already knew that they would definitely lose as they were identifying the formation quickly. They could not beat Lu Ming. They were even more curious about how many Lu Ming could find.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes were red and he growled.</p><p>He had always harbored a grudge against Lu Ming after being abused by him the last time. However, he could not defeat Lu Ming. He had always wanted to humiliate Lu Ming in the Dao of inscription in this competition.</p><p>But now?</p><p>The array that Lu Ming found was far superior to his. How could he humiliate him?</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>In the air, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others all revealed expressions of interest.</p><p>Lu Ming had no other thoughts in his mind. He pointed his finger continuously and had no intention of stopping.</p><p>He had received the inheritance from Lian Cang, so he knew a lot of inscriptions and formations. Also, the inscriptions and formations that dandan had given him were even more complex and had all kinds of things.</p><p>The formations on these drawings were only meant to test the young, so how could they possibly stump him?</p><p>The number of formations he found continued to increase, and soon, it exceeded 90, but it did not stop.</p><p>Very quickly-</p><p>Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight … Finally, Lu Ming pointed with a finger. The sound of a sword whistling reverberated throughout the square.</p><p>Ninety-nine. Lu Ming had found ninety-nine formations.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally stopped because he realized that there was no more formation on the picture.</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was silent. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in a daze. Their eyes were wide open and they could not say a word.</p><p>It was too shocking. Lu Ming had actually found all the array techniques. This was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>In the history of the talisman Amulet sect, this had only happened a few times.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming’s inscription skills were also so terrifying that they were above his martial arts? How was this possible? How could there be such an abnormal person in the world?</p><p>being good at identifying formations doesn’t mean that one’s Dao of inscriptions is good. Identifying formations tests one’s knowledge and insight. Perhaps tianyun has seen many inscriptions and formations before, which is why he’s so good at identifying formations!</p><p>that’s right. There have been people like that in history. The cultivation level and usage of mental fire were very poor. However, due to his extensive reading, he has very good eyesight and is very good at identifying arrays. Perhaps Lu Ming is such a person!</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, it must be like this!”</p><p>Many people agreed. It seemed that this was the only way to make them feel better.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout suddenly reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned to the person who had shouted, sunrise.</p><p>The person who shouted was sunrise.</p><p>Xu RI’s eyes were red as he glared at Lu Ming and roared, ” “Tianyun, it’s impossible for you to find all the formations. You’re cheating, you’re definitely cheating!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He looked at the rising sun and said, ” “Which eye of yours saw me cheating? Also, there are so many people here, did anyone see me cheating?”</p><p>“Maybe you’re just lucky and picked a very simple picture. There are a total of 5000 pictures here, so it’s normal for you to pick a simple one.”</p><p>Sunrise gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p>At this moment, he was filled with jealousy. He had completely forgotten that Meng Chong had said that the difficulty of these 5000 drawings was the same.</p><p>The reason why he said this was because he was suspicious of Meng Chong, a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>As expected, Meng Chong’s face darkened. He looked at the rising sun and snorted.</p><p>Sunrise shuddered but still gritted his teeth and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming could really find all the arrays. He still believed that Lu Ming was lucky and had chosen a simple picture.</p><p>In the crowd, there were also people who revealed thoughtful expressions.</p><p>Some people had the same thoughts as the rising sun.</p><p>After all, there were a total of 5000 drawings on the White jade wall, and every one of them was different. It was too difficult to ensure that the difficulty of all 5000 drawings was the same. Perhaps, there were some drawings that were relatively easier?</p><p>Many people had such thoughts. They were no longer as shocked as they were when they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He looked at the rising sun indifferently and said,”So you’re saying that the difficulty of your painting is very high?”</p><p>“At least it’s harder than yours!”</p><p>Sunrise said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode toward the rising sun.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Sunrise’s body trembled, and he could not help but take a step back.</p><p>He was still traumatized after being beaten up by Lu Ming for a while previously. He was afraid that Lu Ming would fly into a rage out of humiliation and beat him up again.</p><p>“You’re really trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips, making Sunrise’s face turn ashen.</p><p>“You found 43 formations? This is your result? You think you can be called a God-tier heaven’s favorite?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“The difficulty is different. What are you so proud of?”</p><p>Sunrise gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Oh, really? Difficulty? He he he!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming suddenly strode forward to the picture of the rising sun and waved his hand.</p><p>Countless finger shadows flew out and touched the picture of the rising sun.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
