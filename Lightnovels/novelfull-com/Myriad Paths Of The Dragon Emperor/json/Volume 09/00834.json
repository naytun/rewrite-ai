He had not come here to die.</p><p>...</p><p>He had never thought that he would face such a situation. At this moment, he was extremely terrified.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A long and sharp cry was heard, spreading for hundreds of miles.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man in the sky demon Valley spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming, right? I advise you to stop. Even if you win this battle, you can’t kill aokun!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s eyes seemed to be golden. He stood high in the sky with his hands behind his back, looking down at Lu Ming. A faint Majesty exuded from his body, like an Emperor looking down on his people.</p><p>&Nbsp; this young man was no small matter. Even corpse demon and di Feng were very polite to him.</p><p>The demon clan of the sky demon Valley was unfathomable, and the geniuses of the younger generation were also very frightening.</p><p>Because the demon clan of the sky demon Valley was not on the list of top 1000 talents, no one knew how many powerful descendants there were in the sky demon Valley and how pure their bloodline was.</p><p>This golden-robed young man was the same. He gave off an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>Ordinary people would be more or less afraid.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not buy it. He glanced at the gold-robed young man indifferently and said,”I can’t kill him? What a joke, aokun and I had a life and death battle. One side will die and the other side will die. Don’t you understand this logic?”</p><p>The light in the Golden-robed young man’s eyes grew brighter, and a faint golden light emanated from his body. He said coldly, ” I advise you to let aokun go. He’s a rare genius of the demon race and the Son of some Big Shot in the flood-Dragon Tribe. If you kill him, even if you hide in ninedragons, you’ll definitely take part in the battle of Providence with your talent. Then, if you meet someone from the demon race in the battle of Providence, you’ll definitely die!</p><p>This was a blatant threat.</p><p>The heavenly monster tribe was filled with geniuses, and they had never been weaker than the Emperor heaven divine Palace. In this generation, there were many geniuses and descendants with extremely dense bloodlines. If they targeted someone in the Battle of Destiny, anyone would be afraid.</p><p>hehe, you’ve lost, and now you’re threatening me from behind. What a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. He continued, I just want to ask, if I lose this battle, will aokun show mercy? ”</p><p>The heavenly monster tribe quieted down.</p><p>The demon race was brutal. If Lu Ming was defeated, aokun would not let him go.</p><p>“Your identities are different!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man said after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Dogshit!”</p><p>Lu Ming only replied with two words. BOOM! His aura exploded and he raised his infinite Dragon Spear high, stabbing it fiercely at aokun’s glabella.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Aokun hollered, his huge body wanted to struggle.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the next moment, the infinite Dragon Spear pierced through aokun’s forehead. The entire spear entered and the powerful spear light pierced through aokun’s head.</p><p>One spear pierced through aokun’s head.</p><p>Aokun hollered, a look of unwillingness flashed in his eyes. His huge dragon body struggled for a while before he stopped moving.</p><p>Aokun, dead!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Several angry roars came from the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Three figures flickered and appeared around Lu Ming. Their violent auras enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The peak of the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm. These three figures were all equivalent to the demonic race’s prodigies at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm and were extremely powerful.</p><p>In the sky, the Golden-robed young man didn’t move, but his killing intent was so strong that he didn’t even try to hide it.</p><p>Everyone from the heavenly corpse sect looked on coldly, their eyes flashing with anticipation.</p><p>They hoped that more of the heavenly demon Valley’s and the Emperor sky divine Palace’s geniuses would die. That way, it would definitely be beneficial to the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Brother Peng, this is too much!”</p><p>Di Feng frowned as he spoke.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming was a genius of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He could not just sit by and do nothing.</p><p>“That’s right. It’s a battle of life and death. It’s normal for Lu Ming to kill aokun. What’s the meaning of you sending a few seventh level spiritual ocean tier elites? Do you think that there’s no one else in our empyrean heaven divine Palace? My brothers, go!”</p><p>The fat man seized the opportunity to shout, trying to encourage the others to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fatty, you’re right. Lu Ming is at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier. If you have the ability, send out an expert at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier to fight him!”</p><p>Xie nianqing agreed with fatty.</p><p>not bad. If you have the ability, let’s fight at the same level!</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others chimed in.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the fatty and the rest quietened down.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He glanced at the three demons and said,”If you guys want to fight, then fight. So what if you’re one level higher?”</p><p>So what if he was one level higher?</p><p>His voice reverberated throughout the entire area, filled with Ling Yun’s heroic spirit.</p><p>If aokun dared to fight an expert one level above him, how could Lu Ming not?</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was not rare for him to be able to fight someone of a higher level. So what if the other party was an extremely powerful heaven’s favorite?</p><p>“Alright, you’re the one who’s looking for death. Don’t move, I’ll kill him!”</p><p>A blue-robed young man stepped out, his eyes flashing with lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline reappeared. The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes explained everything.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The blue-robed young man turned into a huge bird. His wingspan was more than 30 meters wide, and his body was covered with dense lightning.</p><p>“This is the lightning bird, it has the bloodline of the Thunder God bird.”</p><p>this lightning bird already has 30% of the bloodline power!</p><p>Cries of alarm came from the surroundings.</p><p>Although the bloodline density of this lightning bird wasn’t as high as aokun’s, its cultivation had reached the peak of the seventh level spiritual ocean realm. Its battle power was much stronger than aokun’s.</p><p>The lightning bird’s speed was astonishing. It was like a bolt of lightning that flashed past.</p><p>Endless lightning bolts filled the air and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming performed blood fusion and turned it into the prison-suppressing stele, which collided with the lightning bird.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning bird was sent flying, but the prison-suppressing stele also trembled slightly this time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the prison-suppressing stele expanded rapidly and continued to suppress the lightning bird.</p><p>In the process of suppressing it, the prison-suppressing stele burst out a terrifying devouring power and enveloped the lightning bird.</p><p>“Argh! What’s going on?”</p><p>The lightning bird cried out in alarm. It felt the blood in its body boil. Its strength had been reduced by several percent due to the devouring power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele hit the lightning bird heavily. The lightning around the bird was destroyed. The bird spat out a mouthful of blood and its huge body fell onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded again.</p><p>The lightning bird that had reached the peak of the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier had been defeated. It had been defeated so cleanly in just a few moves.</p><p>Two huge demonic beasts lay on the huge fighting ring.</p><p>The lightning bird screeched and transformed into its human form. It retreated quickly and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk and transformed into Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>“Next, which one of you will fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the other two demons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
