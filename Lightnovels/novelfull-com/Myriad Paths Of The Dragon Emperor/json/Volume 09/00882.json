They had not expected Meng Chong to call out tianyun first.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned as well. He did not expect to be the first to go on stage. However, he did not care. It did not matter which rank he went on stage.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Sunrise!”</p><p>Then, Meng Chong reported another name.</p><p>The crowd went silent, and then they all revealed strange smiles.</p><p>Meng Chong was the first one to let Lu Ming fight against the rising sun. This was definitely intentional.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. This Supreme Meng Chong was really interesting.</p><p>In the crowd, Sunrise’s eyes flickered. He stepped into the air and walked onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Tianyun, even though you’ve passed level 36 of the thousand formation Pagoda, I’m guessing that you’ve done so by relying on martial arts, right? Can you break through with your Dao of inscription?”</p><p>you’re courting death! Xu RI said coldly as he stared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>The eyes of the people around the White jade square flickered.</p><p>“I think Sunrise’s words make sense!”</p><p>that’s right. In the thousand formations Pagoda, no one could see how tianyun Shi broke through the formations. Perhaps he broke through with the power of martial arts. His martial arts are indeed very terrifying!</p><p>yes, martial arts can also break arrays. Why didn’t I think of this before? maybe it’s true!</p><p>then it’s not that impressive that he passed the 36th level. After all, his power of martial arts is really strong. If the other 13 zongzis were to challenge the medium difficulty level of the thousand formations Pagoda, they would be able to pass quickly!</p><p>The discussion around them grew louder and louder. Many people had suspicious looks in their eyes.</p><p>They all thought that Lu Ming had relied on the power of martial arts to clear level 36 of the thousand formations Pagoda.</p><p>just watch. No matter what, martial arts can’t be used in the third round. You can only rely on the Dao of inscription. We’ll soon find out whether the Dao of the heavenly cloud is strong or not!</p><p>“Not bad! Just watch!”</p><p>Some people were more rational and did not rush to make a conclusion.</p><p>On the fighting ring, sunrise smiled smugly when he saw that his words had aroused everyone’s suspicion and caused them to deny all of Lu Ming’s achievements.</p><p>“Hmph, tianyun, let’s fight purely with the Dao of inscription. I’ll let you know that it was your mistake to hit me last time. I’ll pay you back ten times over!”</p><p>Sunrise gritted his teeth.</p><p>During this process, Lu Ming’s expression was very calm. He was carefree as if he did not care at all.</p><p>are you done with your nonsense? if you’re done, let’s start. The others still want to compete!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently. From his tone, it was as if he did not care about the rising sun.</p><p>“Since you’re so eager to be abused, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Sunrise said coldly. Then, he strode forward. With every step he took, an array would appear on the fighting ring.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen large formations appeared on the fighting ring. These large formations condensed monstrous flames and surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and runes spread out from under his feet. They seemed to be alive and swam to the array set up by the rising sun.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Sunrise’s array formation was like a bubble. With a pop, it disappeared.</p><p>The flames that filled the sky also disappeared.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>Sunrise was shocked. He then roared and waved his hands. On the ground, another formation appeared.</p><p>However, the formation had only emerged halfway when Lu Ming took a light step forward. The formation that had just emerged from the rising sun disappeared with a puff.</p><p>Sunrise bellowed angrily and continued to inscribe the array. However, Lu Ming took another light step and Sunrise’s array also appeared halfway before disappearing.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes were red. He roared and continued to set up the array. The blue mental energy fire between his brows was dancing wildly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was expressionless. With his hands behind his back, he walked casually on the ground as if he was taking a stroll in a courtyard.</p><p>With every step he took, the formation that was half-formed by the rising sun would collapse and dissipate.</p><p>what a brilliant method of breaking formations! Every time sunrise tried to inscribe a formation, tianyun would be able to accurately see through the weakness of his formation and break it!</p><p>A white-haired old man stroked his beard and nodded his head repeatedly with a surprised look on his face.</p><p>Many people recognized him as an elder of the talisman sect. He was a level-eight inscriber and extremely powerful.</p><p>Since the level-eight Alchemist had spoken, there was no mistake.</p><p>Many people gasped, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>To think that tianyun would be able to see through the weakness of the rising sun formation even before it was completed, or perhaps even just halfway through its inscribing process. This was truly terrifying.</p><p>If it was a complete formation, it would still make sense if it could see through the weakness.</p><p>But for a formation to be able to find its weak point before it was fully inscribed and before it could even fully display itself, how it would operate was still unknown. It wasn’t even clear what inscription the other party wanted to inscribe. This was too terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could easily take a step forward and quickly break the rising sun’s array. His control of the mental energy fire was extremely amazing.</p><p>This was a slap to the face of the rising sun.</p><p>Earlier on, didn’t sunrise say that Lu Ming used martial arts to break the array in the myriad array Pagoda? Now, Lu Ming would let him see what he had to use to break the array.</p><p>Was it the martial Dao or the Dao of inscription?</p><p>At this moment, Sunrise’s face was red.</p><p>He bellowed continuously. Every time he was halfway through inscribing the array, Lu Ming would break it. That feeling was too uncomfortable. It was as if he had strength but could not use it. Every time he was halfway through, he had to hold it back. He almost vomited blood.</p><p>In the end, he roared in anger and retreated quickly. With a wave of his hand, nine huge puppets appeared and formed a battle formation, charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took a step forward. Suddenly, dense inscriptions appeared on the ground. A huge formation emerged and nine combat swords condensed. With one slash, the nine puppets of the rising sun were cut in half.</p><p>At the same time, another formation appeared under Sunrise’s feet. Vines flew out and wrapped around sunrise.</p><p>Then, the formation glowed, and one fist after another condensed and rushed toward the rising sun.</p><p>“No, no, I admit defeat!”</p><p>no! sunrise shouted, but it was too late. The endless fists drowned him out. Only his shrill screams could be heard on the fighting ring.</p><p>When the fist disappeared and the formation was hidden, sunrise was lying miserably on the fighting ring. His body was covered in wounds and his face was swollen like a pig’s head. No one could recognize him.</p><p>Looking at Sunrise’s miserable appearance, many people felt cold all over.</p><p>heart of the earth. His usage of mental energy fire has reached heart of the earth. Impressive!</p><p>It was still the eighth-grade Alchemist. He stroked his beard and spoke with admiration.</p><p>“What? Tianyun has actually reached the state of ‘heart’? ”</p><p>Many people were extremely shocked.</p><p>There was only one step between the minute and the heart, but the difference was like heaven and earth.</p><p>Other than the 13 zongzi candidates, only Ji mai, Yan Tongtong, Meng Jia, and Hu Ming had reached the state of heart supremacy.</p><p>Now, there was another tianyun.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
