There was nothing to be proud of. He was not afraid of anyone in a battle of the same level.</p><p>...</p><p>Although GUI Yue’s bloodline was at the second rank of the divine level, it was impossible for the bloodline martial technique he had comprehended to reach the upper-grade demigod level.</p><p>GUI Yue had only executed a low-grade demigod-level martial arts technique. Even if the cultivation technique that she cultivated was also of the divine level, she was still crushed by Lu Ming in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even use his dragon power or Blood Meridian fusion to defeat ghost moon easily.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on Blood Sword 19.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue fighting?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was transmitted to Blood Sword 19 as he stepped on the ghost moon.</p><p>Instantly, everyone’s eyes turned to look at Blood Sword 19. Lu Ming’s intention was clear. He was clearly challenging Blood Sword 19. In that case, would Blood Sword 19 dare to accept the challenge?</p><p>Blood Sword 19’s expression turned ugly. His cultivation was also at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, which was the same as long Qianli and Wang haoxian. The bloodline he had awakened was also at the first level of the divine level, and his combat strength was about the same as long Qianli and Wang haoxian.</p><p>Even ghost moon had been crushed. If he went up, wouldn’t he be humiliating himself?</p><p>Hmph, don’t think that you’re so great just because you defeated GUI Yue. There are many divine level prodigies at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier in our heavenly corpse sect who are stronger than GUI Yue. It’s just that they didn’t come today. Do you dare to go to the gathering in half a month? ”</p><p>The 19th Blood Sword said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, it seems like you don’t dare to fight. If you don’t dare to fight, then say you don’t dare to fight. Why are you talking so much nonsense? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked GUI Yue, who was like a dead fish, towards Blood Sword 19.</p><p>A disciple of the heavenly corpse sect walked out and caught GUI Yue’s body.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Blood Sword 19 shouted, and then the group of people from the heavenly corpse sect fled with their tails between their legs.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming in awe.</p><p>He had crushed ghost moon and forced Blood Sword 19 to retreat with a single sentence. What kind of power was this?</p><p>This was especially true for Luan Fengyun and the other Luan family disciples. They were all extremely terrified.</p><p>Luan Fengyun looked at Lu Ming in a daze. He still could not believe it.</p><p>Half a year ago, Lu Ming was still suppressed by him and could only use the formation to resist. However, half a year later, Lu Ming could easily defeat those God-level prodigies, let alone him.</p><p>a divine bloodline! He must have used the token to enter the blood pool and awaken a divine bloodline. Otherwise, he can’t be this strong!</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s mind whirred, and then he quietly retreated with the other Luan family youths.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you!”</p><p>Long Qianli stepped forward and looked at Lu Ming with a complicated expression. He cupped his fists and said, ”</p><p>“Brother long, you’re too polite!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>brother Lu, you’ve really shocked me. In just half a year, you’ve actually reached such a realm. I’m ashamed!</p><p>Long Qianli sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s rapid progress showed that his potential was much greater than his. His future was unpredictable, just like those who ranked at the top of the list of top 1000 talents, especially those in the top 20 or even the top 10. Those were all unpredictable monsters.</p><p>“I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and brushed it off lightly. He did not continue to talk about this topic.</p><p>Long Qianli didn’t say much. He said, ” brother Lu, in half a month, there will be an exchange under the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron in the first Dragon’s Vein. At that time, besides the top 100 geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect, most of the people will participate. The powerful descendants of the sky demon Valley will also participate. With brother Lu’s combat power, you will be a great help to our side!</p><p>“The top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents, aren’t you going to participate? And the talisman Amulet sect, no one came?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>the talisman Amulet sect has been very weak in the past few thousand years. Although it is still one of the four overlords of the eastern barren territory, it can no longer be compared to the other three. In the past few hundred years, it has been very low-key and will not send anyone to participate. It will only send its Supreme talents to participate in the war of Providence!</p><p>Long Qianli nodded and began to explain.</p><p>and the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents are the key to the battle of Providence. They won’t be exposed easily and are all training and cultivating in secret places. They won’t show up before the battle of Providence.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ll take my leave then!”</p><p>Long Qianli said. He then looked at ruan Tingting and said, ” “Tingting, are you going to be Di Tian’s Royal Guard with me or are you going out to accompany your friend?”</p><p>“Brother long, you can go back first. I’ll stay here with Xuanxuan, Lu Ming, and the rest!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said with a smile.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Long Qianli nodded, then cupped his fists to Lu Ming and the rest before he left.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re so powerful. You’re much more powerful than you were half a year ago!</p><p>Qiao Xuan flew in front of Lu Ming, her big eyes sparkling as she looked at him, her face full of admiration and worship.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed drily and rubbed his nose. He was a little embarrassed by Qiao Xuan’s stare.</p><p>“Hmph, pervert, let’s go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked over and snorted. He held Lu Ming’s arm and pulled him forward.</p><p>“Hehe, miss Xie nianqing is jealous!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s voice came from behind.</p><p>of course! Xuanxuan, you’re too mischievous. Why don’t you check if miss nianqing is present!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s soft voice came through.</p><p>“Tingting, come, I’ll hold you!” Fatty’s voice rang out.</p><p>“Go, go to the side and cool off!”</p><p>Ruan Ting Ting’s voice came out, followed by Qiao Xuan’s bell-like laughter and Fatty’s sigh.</p><p>Wang haoxian looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a complicated expression, then followed them.</p><p>The group of people headed toward the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Following that, everyone would occasionally tour the mountains and rivers, and occasionally stop to cultivate. They were all young people, and after not seeing each other for half a year, they had many common topics to talk about. They got along very well, and even Xie nianqing started to talk more.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming did not feel too tense. It was a rare moment of relaxation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed. There were still three days left before the exchange between the Supreme talents of the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to the exchange?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting asked.</p><p>of course, I’m going. All the heaven’s favorites from the three Overlord forces are here. I can’t miss such a rare event. Besides, I want to see the powerful descendants of the sky demon Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The sky demon Valley could be said to be the most ancient power in the East barren. It had existed since ancient times, much longer than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the talisman sect.</p><p>The sky demon Valley was made up entirely of demon beasts. There were countless powerful demons in it, and there were countless descendants with the bloodline of divine beasts. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>Some people said that the heavenly demon Valley was the strongest force in the East barren, even stronger than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Moreover, in every generation, the sky demon Valley would give birth to many descendants with the bloodline of divine beasts. These descendants were undoubtedly the proud Children of Heaven among the demon beasts with extremely terrifying combat strength.</p><p>that’s great! Let’s set off together. If we arrive early, we can take a rest there!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Tingting, can I go?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan blinked her big eyes.</p><p>Among all of them, Qiao Xuan was much weaker and could not be considered a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>And the exchange meeting was attended by geniuses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
