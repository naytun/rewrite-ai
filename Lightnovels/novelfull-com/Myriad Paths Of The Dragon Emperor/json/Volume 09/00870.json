I’ll defeat you!</p><p>Guan Rong’s expression turned ugly after being reprimanded by Lu Ming. He strode forward. With every step he took, dense runes would appear on the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A ferocious Tiger was formed and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>After the Tiger, there were also giant bears, pythons, and other demonic beasts. In an instant, more than ten demonic beasts pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>To be able to set up so many formations in an instant, Guan Rong’s Dao of formations was extremely terrifying.</p><p>His usage of mental energy fire had also reached the peak of the refinement realm, which was similar to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>As the demonic beasts pounced at Lu Ming, Guan Rong waved his hand and three inscription scrolls appeared in front of him. The three inscriptions were activated at the same time, and three flood Dragons pounced out with a roar. Their attack power was equivalent to the peak ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>This kind of attack was like a storm. A normal ninth level spiritual ocean tier martial artist would be drowned by this storm of attacks and torn into pieces.</p><p>The combat style of an inscription master was completely different from that of a warrior.</p><p>Lu Ming was expressionless as he strode forward and struck out with his palm. The space rumbled violently and the demonic beasts that pounced at him were instantly destroyed. What followed were three flood Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Four intents of heaven and earth wrapped around his body as he circulated 20% of the prison suppressing heaven Art’s power to clash with the three flood Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to use the prison suppressing heavenly art at full force. The power of the prison suppressing heavenly art was equivalent to the sixth stage of a high-grade demigod martial arts technique. The consumption of vital essence was extremely terrifying. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, if he used all his strength, his vital essence would be completely drained in a few moves.</p><p>With three loud bangs, the three flood Dragons were defeated.</p><p>Guan Rong’s pupils contracted sharply. In an instant, an array appeared on his body and formed a pair of wings. With a flap of the wings, he retreated like a bolt of lightning. At the same time, he waved his hand and five inscription talismans appeared in front of him.</p><p>Two of them turned into two rings of light and enveloped Guan Rong’s body. These were protective talismans that were indestructible.</p><p>As for the other three inscription scrolls, two of them condensed two combat swords and slashed at Lu Ming. They also had the power of the peak ninth level spiritual ocean realm. The most shocking inscription scroll condensed a long spear and stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power that this long spear emitted was terrifying and shocking, exceeding the range of the ninth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>If one had to classify it, it would be classified as a Grade 10 lv 6 inscription scroll.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned serious. He condensed two long Spears in his hands and shot them out, clashing with the two combat swords.</p><p>His palm hit the spear.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and the long spear exploded. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took a few steps forward, appearing in front of Guan Rong in an instant.</p><p>His palm was like a sharp sword, stabbing forward.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two light screens in front of Guan Rong shattered like paper.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Guan Rong shrieked and retreated like a bolt of lightning. However, Lu Ming was faster and followed closely behind.</p><p>He stretched out his palm and grabbed Guan Rong’s throat. With a jolt of his Zhen Yuan, Guan Rong’s body suddenly went soft like mud.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and Guan Rong fell heavily to the ground, right beside sunrise.</p><p>Everyone around them widened their eyes in shock. Lu Ming was too powerful. He defeated Guan Rong as if it was a piece of cake. This made the other geniuses ‘faces turn ugly.</p><p>“Haven’t you all been waiting for a long time? If you want to fight, then hurry up and come at me together. I don’t have that much time to play with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to establish his authority today.</p><p>arrogant! He’s too arrogant!</p><p>“You think you’re invincible just because you defeated sunrise and Guan Rong? What a joke!”</p><p>“Since he wants to die, let’s attack him together and see how capable he is!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded. One figure after another stepped forward, and a powerful spiritual storm burst out, filling the entire area.</p><p>There were more than a dozen of them, and they were all God-level talents ranked in the top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents. Some of them were even in the top 200.</p><p>However, Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, and Meng Jia didn’t walk out. Instead, they watched from afar with bright eyes.</p><p>It was obvious that the three of them did not want to join forces to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cut the crap and make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He had made great progress this time and wanted to have a big fight.</p><p>arrogant! Let’s attack together!</p><p>With a cold shout, more than 50 huge puppets appeared on the ground.</p><p>For every puppet, the weakest was equivalent to the ninth level of the spiritual ocean tier, while the strongest far exceeded the ninth level.</p><p>The puppet roared angrily. It stomped on the ground and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>A portion of them had inscription scrolls appear in front of them. Dazzling light spread out from these inscription scrolls, giving off a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger. The power of the nine Dragons in his nine-Dragon bloodline exploded, and a layer of purple-gold scales appeared on his body.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>“A secret technique of martial arts!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and the rocks exploded. He dashed out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>His fists continued to punch out, clashing with the puppets.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sounds of explosions rose and fell as the puppets at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean tier suddenly exploded like fragile balloons.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was terrifying when he combined his dragon power with the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Not just the puppets at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm, but even those puppets that surpassed the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm would still be blown up. Such a scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The inscription scroll glowed and all kinds of powerful attacks poured down on Lu Ming.</p><p>There were endless flames, as well as lightning, storms, swords, blades, and so on. Every single one of them was extremely terrifying, far exceeding the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>The combat strength of such geniuses all surpassed the peak ninth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Ordinary experts at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean tier would be blasted into smithereens in an instant.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unafraid. He was covered in dragon scales and was indestructible. He charged up and unleashed the prison suppressing heavenly art from every inch of his body. The attacks exploded with a loud bang. Lu Ming broke through the layers of attacks and charged towards the elites.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites were shocked. Each of them used an inscription formation and retreated quickly.</p><p>At the same time, with every step they took back, they would leave an inscription on the ground.</p><p>At the same time, a large number of puppets and inscription scrolls appeared.</p><p>This time, many of the puppets actually formed a large formation. When they worked together, their aura was even more shocking.</p><p>Moreover, someone even took out an even stronger inscription scroll.</p><p>These people were known as God-tier geniuses, and their combat prowess was already extremely terrifying. They were characters that could contend against the geniuses of the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and heavenly corpse sect. They were naturally very strong.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already extremely terrifying at the last ninedragons exchange. He had the absolute ability to fight against the top 200. This time, Lu Ming’s earth will had a breakthrough. All four types of will had reached the advanced stage of the second level. When they were combined, they were even more powerful.</p><p>At the same time, the power of the nine Dragons had also become much stronger. It was several times stronger than the Dragon power from before, and with the addition of the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>His cultivation had also increased by one level, reaching the peak of the seventh level spiritual ocean realm. Lu Ming was now fully confident that he could fight di Feng and Shi mo, who were ranked 101st and 102nd on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>How powerful was he?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
