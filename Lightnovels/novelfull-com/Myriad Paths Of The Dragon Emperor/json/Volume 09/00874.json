Then, he sat cross-legged and carefully comprehended that inspiration.</p><p>He sat there for an entire day.</p><p>A day later, he suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes had calmed down, but revealed a ray of confidence.</p><p>Then, he stepped into the light door and stood in the void.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blue arrow was as fast as lightning. It made hundreds of turns in the air in an instant and was shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and an arrow was formed.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a single thought, the arrow flew out. In the next moment, it accurately appeared in front of the arrow and collided with it.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The next moment, two arrows appeared and shot toward Lu Ming from two directions.</p><p>With a single thought, two arrows flew out and made hundreds of turns in the air, catching up to the two arrows and canceling them out.</p><p>the heart is at its limit. This is the heart. I’ve finally broken through!</p><p>The corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The arrows flew in all directions, but none of them could hit Lu Ming. In the end, all the arrows were blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s usage of the mental energy fire had finally broken through and reached the early stage of the heart realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. He continued to cultivate.</p><p>He didn’t choose the top difficulty, but continued to train in the advanced difficulty.</p><p>It was said that the top difficulty level was for those at the level of ‘will’.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating in the spiritual tempering Hall for fifty days. There were still ten days left before the competition on the observatory platform.</p><p>Lu Ming’s usage of mental energy fire had already reached the late-stage of ‘heart limit’.</p><p>To go from the peak of minute subtlety to the late-stage of heart realm in 50 days was a speed that would leave anyone dumbfounded.</p><p>Only a seventh-rank Alchemist could master the state of heart. A sixth-rank Alchemist who could master it was already a genius among geniuses.</p><p>Anyone could come to the spiritual tempering Hall, but who would have such a speed of progress?</p><p>From this, it could be seen that Lu Ming was very talented in the inscription Dao.</p><p>it’s time to go out and buy a batch of blood essence. It’s been so long, I should have it by now!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and left the spirit tempering Hall, flying toward the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming went to the treasure Pavilion once and ordered a batch of demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>“Beauty, how’s the demonic beast blood essence I ordered?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>It was still the same beauty from before.</p><p>“Junior Brother tianyun, you’ve come!”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s big eyes stared at Lu Ming, shining brightly.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was a famous person in the talisman sect. Who did not know that he had fought more than ten God-level prodigies back then?</p><p>the 50 portions of Class 8 Lv 6 demonic beast blood essence and 50 portions of Class 9 Lv 6 demonic beast blood essence you asked for took a lot of effort to gather!</p><p>The beauty laughed and took out a storage ring.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the storage ring. He then handed the raw gemstone to the other party.</p><p>It was a total of 60000 raw stones, and this was the price after the discount since the other party had bought so many.</p><p>“It’s really expensive!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He really couldn’t afford this demonic beast blood essence. It seemed that after using this batch, he’d better go hunt for it himself.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly thought.</p><p>The raw gemstones left behind by the nine suns Supreme martial artist were only about a million in total. If this continued, it would not take long for them to run out.</p><p>“I still have to use it sparingly!”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind. After paying the raw gemstones, he headed to Yun Peak House.</p><p>Along the way, people who saw Lu Ming looked at him with awe and curiosity.</p><p>the competition will begin in ten days. Tianyun’s martial Dao might be strong, but his Dao of inscription might not be!</p><p>that’s right. We’ll be able to see the real deal in ten days. If the Dao of inscription is not good enough, no matter how strong his martial arts are, he’ll have to step down from the zongzi candidate throne!</p><p>Many people were discussing and looking forward to the competition in ten days.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the cloud Peak Residence and saw Bai chixue inscribing the inscription scroll seriously.</p><p>Her Jade-like fingers were long and beautiful as she danced in the air. Inscriptions flew into the talisman paper one after another.</p><p>“The peak of the subtle realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Bai chixue had made great progress after not seeing him for some time. Her use of the spiritual fire had reached the peak of the refinement realm.</p><p>It didn’t take long for him to finish inscribing a class 7 Lv 6 Rune Scroll.</p><p>“Eh? Tianyun, you’re back? Where had he been cultivating all this time? How’s the progress?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes lit up when she saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s alright, there’s been some progress!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Some progress? Why don’t we have a competition to see who’s faster at inscribing inscriptions?”</p><p>Bai chixue said, with an eager look in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in his heart. This girl had a breakthrough and wanted to show off in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sure, how do we compete?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“What do you think about our speed of inscribing formations outside?”</p><p>Bai chixue said with excitement.</p><p>“Sure, but since it’s a competition, there should be some punishment, right? If you lose, how will you be punished?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What punishment?” Bai chixue blinked her big eyes.</p><p>“How about this? if you lose, you kiss me. If I lose, I’ll kiss you. How about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“You … Who wants to kiss you? You Rascal!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face turned red.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. He did not do it on purpose. He was in a good mood after having a breakthrough in the use of mental energy fire. Moreover, he had not seen Bai chixue for a long time. He just wanted to tease her and relax the atmosphere.</p><p>“It’s fine if you don’t agree, but whoever loses will treat you to a big meal!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode out of the room.</p><p>Bai chixue glared at Lu Ming, but there was a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p><p>Outside the cloud Peak House, there was a large open space. It was very wide.</p><p>The two of them stood facing each other.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>break! Bai chixue suddenly shouted and stomped on the ground. At the same time, her ten fingers bloomed in the air, and dazzling inscriptions flew out and sank into the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the ground, a formation immediately appeared, shining with bright light.</p><p>However, Lu Ming kept smiling and stood there with his hands behind his back, not moving at all.</p><p>this guy, why isn’t he moving? Hmph, he’s really arrogant. Watch how I teach him a lesson!</p><p>Hmph! Bai chixue snorted and took a step forward. The formation glowed and two snow-white Eagles were formed, flying toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming began to move.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dense runes appeared on the ground. The runes intertwined and formed a formation.</p><p>In an instant, nine formations appeared on the ground almost at the same time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
