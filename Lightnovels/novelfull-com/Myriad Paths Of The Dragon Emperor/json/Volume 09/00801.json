If God-level prodigies had better places to cultivate, they would not come here at all. Why did Wang haoxian suddenly come here?</p><p>They thought of Wang Haotian. Wang haoxian was Wang Haotian’s sister.</p><p>Earlier, they saw Lu Ming chasing after Wang Haotian. After that, Lu Ming changed his appearance and returned to the same place, leaving with two other people who had passed the ninth level.</p><p>Could something have happened to Wang Haotian? otherwise, why would Wang haoxian come with such murderous intent?</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Ming?</p><p>Suddenly, they remembered who the other two people were. Lu Ming had a few companions. One of them was a beautiful woman while the other was a fatty. They were all people with terrifying talents.</p><p>Then it was not difficult to guess the two people who had passed the ninth level.</p><p>“Tell me, has my brother Wang Haotian been here before? who did he have a conflict with? Don’t try to lie to me!”</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly. The killing intent around him grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>previously, Wang Haotian came here and had a big fight with Lu Ming. In the end, Lu Ming chased after him and he fled this place. No one knows where he went!</p><p>The other person also shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming? who is Lu Ming? What did he look like? Tell me the details!”</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly.</p><p>I said that they came here to obtain the token of a higher Holy Land. He has two companions. One is. beautiful woman and the other is. fatty who carries a battle axe …</p><p>A young man immediately told him everything he knew.</p><p>you dare to kill my brother? no one can save you. If you want to go to a high rank Holy Land to cultivate, I will kill you on the way!</p><p>Wang haoxian’s figure disappeared as he spoke coldly.</p><p>The young men heaved a long sigh of relief. The pressure was too great to be beside Wang haoxian, as if they could be killed by her at any moment.</p><p>Lu Ming really killed Wang Haotian. That’s a big deal. No wonder Wang haoxian went crazy.</p><p>“This is getting interesting!”</p><p>After that, the few young men left. The news that Lu Ming might have killed Wang Haotian and that Wang haoxian was after Lu Ming had spread and caused a huge uproar in the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>Nine Dragon city’s outer ring was surrounded by nine dragon veins, and in the middle, three dragon veins were gathered. They were all very far apart from each other.</p><p>In these areas, there were many wondrous places. There were cultivation sanctuaries, secret realms, and dangerous forbidden areas.</p><p>The blood pool was located in the vast area between the Dragon’s Vein in the East and the three Dragon’s veins in the middle.</p><p>The three of them flew for a few hours and arrived at a vast mountain.</p><p>“According to the Jade talisman given by long Qianli, the blood pool should be right in front!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them continued to fly forward until a large mountain appeared in front of them. There was a blood-colored aura on the mountain, and on the cliff, there were three big words: The blood pool.</p><p>Beside the words, there was a platform protruding from the cliff. Behind the platform was a cave.</p><p>On the platform, there were powerhouses guarding.</p><p>This was the blood pool.</p><p>“Stop! Only those who are qualified can enter the blood pool!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the other two neared, a burly man took a step forward, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>This was definitely an expert above the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Senior, we have a token!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin flashed their tokens.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked around and nodded, it is indeed a token. All of you are qualified to enter the blood pool. However, you have to leave your aura here first. Because, everyone can only enter the blood pool once.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. Long Qianli’s jade talisman had introduced this rule.</p><p>Some high-level cultivation Holy Lands had very strict restrictions. Everyone could only enter the blood pool once and leave their aura here. If they came again in the future, they would be able to detect it.</p><p>The three of them left their auras on one of the stone tablets.</p><p>you guys go in. Remember, do what you can and don’t die in there. You only have half a month. You must come out after half a month!</p><p>The middle-aged man ordered.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and the three of them stepped into the cave.</p><p>As for the middle-aged man, he continued to sit cross-legged on the side.</p><p>The cave was very deep. The three of them walked for a thousand meters and suddenly saw an open space.</p><p>The inside of the mountain was empty, and there was a huge blood pool.</p><p>This blood pool was at least a few thousand meters long, and it was filled with blood-red liquid.</p><p>It looked like fresh blood, but there was no smell of blood.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a slight tingling sensation on his spine below the nine Dragons bloodline and the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>“What a dense bloodline power!”</p><p>Kong Jin praised.</p><p>it’s said that the blood pool has an infinite depth. No one knows where it leads to, but the power of the bloodline comes from the infinite depth. It’s really wonderful!</p><p>furthermore, although the blood pool contains the power of the bloodline, it also contains an ancient murderous aura and killing intent. It is extremely powerful. The deeper we go, the more powerful it will be. We have to be careful later. Let’s go down!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You be careful too!”</p><p>Xie nianqing whispered.</p><p>The fatty nodded and the three of them jumped into the blood pool.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming jumped into the blood pool, shocking battle cries rang out from all directions. There were also the roars of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. Endless killing intent rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This kind of killing intent could affect one’s mind, and if it was stronger, it could even directly cut off one’s soul and obliterate one’s life force.</p><p>However, at the same time, the bright red liquid in all directions contained a powerful and majestic bloodline power.</p><p>This liquid was neither blood nor essence blood. It was formed from the power of the blood.</p><p>A red light flashed on Lu Ming’s spine and formed a vortex. The endless power of the blood Meridian around him was absorbed and integrated into his spine.</p><p>The power of the bloodline could be accumulated in the spine. The stronger it was, the higher the level of the bloodline that would be awakened in the future.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had the nine Dragons bloodline and could devour blood essence to increase his strength, if the level of his third bloodline was higher, it would save him a lot of trouble in the future. Why not?</p><p>The bloodline power here was not strong enough.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he sank.</p><p>The further down he went, the stronger his bloodline power became. However, the killing intent and baleful Qi in the surroundings also became stronger.</p><p>Where did this bloodline power come from? where did the depths of the blood pool lead to? there was actually bloodline power constantly surging out. Could it be leading to a battlefield?</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild. There were many wondrous places in the world. Some of them could not even be found by martial emperors.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming had sunk a hundred meters. The power of the blood Meridian was even more concentrated here. Lu Ming focused his mind on his spine and the suction force suddenly exploded. It was even more terrifying as it continuously absorbed the power of the blood Meridian in the surroundings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
