Now, everyone, follow me in!”</p><p>...</p><p>Bai Shijin shouted and stepped into the vortex first.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another flew up and stepped into the vortex.</p><p>With a flash of light, the person who stepped into the vortex disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed the crowd and flew into the vortex, then disappeared.</p><p>In the end, du songjue and a few other elders stepped in.</p><p>There was a flash of light and Lu Ming and the rest realized that they had appeared on a huge platform.</p><p>It was a huge platform made of stone with patterns on it. Behind it was a huge wall, blocking their way out.</p><p>There was a vortex above their heads. This was the space tunnel they had entered from. After Lu Ming and the rest went to participate in the battle, Bai Shijin and the rest would leave from here.</p><p>The direction in front of him seemed to be empty. It was an endless abyss. On the other side of the abyss, there was a huge door of light.</p><p>that’s the entrance to the battle of Providence!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice came out, pointing to the light door opposite the abyss.</p><p>Lu Ming was surrounded by talisman sect disciples. They had gathered together. Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others had also entered.</p><p>“The people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the heavenly demon Valley have also arrived!”</p><p>Fatty whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over.</p><p>On this platform, he saw people from the other three forces.</p><p>Just like the talisman Amulet sect, every faction had gathered together.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He realized that there were definitely more than 10000 people who had entered the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect also had nearly 10000 people, while the heavenly demon Valley had more than 3000 people.</p><p>How was this possible? How could there be so many geniuses in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?</p><p>The Empyrean divine Palace could be considered as a heaven’s chosen. The total number of heaven’s chosen from the previous list of top 1000 talents and the recently rising heaven’s chosen wouldn’t exceed 800. Including some young experts, there were at most three to four thousand people. How could there be so many people?</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ve heard that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect don’t have that many geniuses and young experts. However, they do train a group of men of sacrifice!”</p><p>Beside him, Bai chixue said in a low voice.</p><p>“Death warrior?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s right, death warrior. Do you see the group of people behind the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? they are all clad in black robes and are carrying various weapons on their backs. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace uses a special technique to fully activate the potential of some young people. Before the age of 30, their strength will skyrocket and they will enter an extremely powerful realm.”</p><p>however, the consequence is that the potential of these young people will be completely exhausted, and even their lifespans will be greatly shortened. Their thoughts will become numb, and they will only know how to obey orders without fear of death. Their goal is to participate in the battle of Providence and help the other elites obtain opportunities and Providence!</p><p>Bai chixue explained.</p><p>There was a glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. These major forces had used all their means for the battle of Providence.</p><p>you see, those people from the heavenly corpse sect who are wrapped in blood-red robes are also men of sacrifice. Our Talisman Amulet sect cultivates the Dao of inscription. Without such an evil secret technique, we won’t do it. As for the demon race of the heavenly demon Valley, they are very proud and won’t do it either. That’s why there are very few of them!</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and understood.</p><p>These men of sacrifice were nothing more than young men under the age of 30 who had been raised with secret techniques to participate in the battle of Providence for consumption.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the crowd and scanned the three major forces.</p><p>In the area of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, he saw the six Supreme martial artists from the six great ancient aristocratic families.</p><p>There were dozens of young men and women in each force. They had extraordinary auras and were unfathomable.</p><p>Needless to say, these people were all top talents on the list of top 1000 talents or at the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming was sizing the other party up and the other party was also sizing them up.</p><p>“Haha, Bai Shijin, du songjue, I didn’t think that your Talisman Amulet sect would still dare to participate in the war. Aren’t you afraid that all the young people of this generation will die?”</p><p>A loud laugh suddenly rang out from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming looked toward the source of the voice and recognized the master of the Wang family, the Supreme martial artist of his generation. He was almost crushed to death by Lu Ming’s Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>“Wang Shengtian!”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s face sank. He snorted and did not say anything.</p><p>that’s good. In any case, your Talisman Amulet sect is getting worse with each generation. The people of this generation have all died inside. With just you old guys, you won’t be able to hold on for a few years. The talisman Amulet sect will be destroyed sooner or later!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family, Wang Shengtian, continued to sneer. His eyes were like lightning as they swept over the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He retracted his aura and moved, wanting to use the others ‘shadows to block his figure.</p><p>However, the next moment, he noticed a cold gaze on him.</p><p>Wang Shengtian’s gaze.</p><p>At this moment, Wang Shengtian’s eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is that you? I didn’t expect you to come to the talisman sect!”</p><p>Wang Shengtian shouted angrily.</p><p>Back then, in the battle of ninedragons, he was almost crushed to death by Lu Ming’s Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. He was a Supreme martial artist of his generation, but he ended up like this. It was a complete loss of face for him. It could be said that he had treated Lu Ming very badly.</p><p>With his cultivation level, he could tell at a glance that Lu Ming had changed his appearance and concealed his aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As Wang Shengtian’s voice rang out, everyone from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace turned to look at the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Who in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace did not know the name Lu Ming?</p><p>Not only the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the other powers also looked over.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming? Is Lu Ming among us?”</p><p>Most of the talisman sect’s people were also shocked as they sized each other up.</p><p>The faces of Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others darkened.</p><p>“Little bastard, don’t think you can hide from me by hiding in the crowd. You’re actually in the talisman Amulet sect? Hmph, let’s see how you’re going to die.”</p><p>Wang Shengtian sneered.</p><p>The other five Supreme martial artists ‘eyes turned cold as they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>They had also lost face in the battle that day. The six great masters had joined forces, but they had not been able to take down Lu Ming, a junior.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Who is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai chixue opened her eyes wide and looked around.</p><p>“Hide? Why would I need to hide? What can you do to me in this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth. His clear voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Then, he strode out of the crowd.</p><p>This place was the entrance to the battle of Providence. It was extremely mysterious and had a powerful suppressing effect.</p><p>The older a person was, the stronger the suppression would be when they came here. For a Supreme martial artist like Wang Shengtian who had lived for thousands of years, he could only display the cultivation of the spirit embryo realm at most, so what did he have to fear?</p><p>This was a well-known fact. Otherwise, he would not have come here in broad daylight. Yan kuangtu and the nine suns Supreme would not have been at ease either, so they did not follow him.</p><p>&Nbsp; once they entered this place, the experts wouldn’t be able to use much of their combat strength.</p><p>At first, Lu Ming did not want to be discovered. He just wanted to avoid some trouble. However, since he had been discovered, he had to be generous and step forward.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun? You … You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Tianyun was actually Lu Ming?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
