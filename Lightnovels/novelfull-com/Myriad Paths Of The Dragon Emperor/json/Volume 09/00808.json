There were level six, Level Seven, and even level eight.</p><p>...</p><p>They were all packed in Jade boxes and sealed with arrays so that their spirituality would not be lost.</p><p>Lu Ming almost drooled.</p><p>Zhang xuan quickly turned his attention to the third storage ring.</p><p>There were a total of three storage rings here.</p><p>The third storage ring contained some miscellaneous items. Lu Ming’s gaze was immediately attracted by the mountain-like pile of raw gemstones.</p><p>Yes, raw stones were piled up like a mountain. No one knew how many pieces there were.</p><p>&Nbsp; also, on the other side were many large metal boxes. When he opened them, he saw that they were all intent crystals.</p><p>There were all sorts of profound meaning crystals, and they were all middle-grade ones. There were more than a hundred thousand pieces.</p><p>More than one hundred thousand middle-grade intent crystals. What kind of concept was this?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was thumping.</p><p>‘I’m rich, I’m really rich.’</p><p>As expected of the nine suns cosmos supremacy. The nine suns supremacy had said that there were no treasures, but in Lu Ming’s eyes, they were all treasures.</p><p>How long would these resources be enough for Lu Ming?</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, I will definitely make good use of these resources.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Then, he focused his mind on the storage ring that was filled with elixirs and spirit herbs and carefully examined it.</p><p>this is the innate original liquid!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. He discovered that the two huge Jade bottles contained the primordial origin liquid. Moreover, they were both high-grade primordial origin liquid.</p><p>Each bottle was a full 50 kilograms.</p><p>In total, there were two hundred catties of primordial origin liquid, which was the Supreme spiritual liquid for cultivating the body.</p><p>“This is the mother of the water spirit spring!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized a treasure in the other Jade bottle.</p><p>The mother of the water spirit spring was a type of spirit liquid. It was even more precious than the upper-grade innate original liquid.</p><p>haha, the mother of the water spirit spring is perfect for cultivating the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>With a thought, the path-understanding ancient tree appeared on the ground. Lu Ming took out the mother of the water spirit spring and poured the entire bottle of it on the xuanhuang silicoid soil.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it. With this bottle of Mother of Water spirit spring, would the path-understanding ancient tree be able to grow?</p><p>Then, he put the path-understanding ancient tree into the Supreme shrine and started to look at it in his storage ring.</p><p>“Green Lotus fruit, snake lump flower, dark Yin grass …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the spiritual herbs one by one. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a Jade box appeared in his hand.</p><p>“It’s actually dark Yin grass!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He thought of a medicine called dark Yin powder.</p><p>He had learned about this medicine when he was refining the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire.</p><p>The dark Yin powder was specifically used to deal with women. As long as a woman breathed in a little, she would be powerless and unable to circulate her true Yuan, allowing her to be slaughtered.</p><p>The main ingredient of the dark Yin powder was the dark Yin grass.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming had no interest in such a herb. But when he saw the dark Yin grass, he thought of Wang haoxian.</p><p>Didn’t Wang haoxian want to kill him? Then he would let her have a taste of the dark Yin grass.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming selected a few supplementary ingredients and began to refine the dark Yin powder.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had successfully refined the dark Yin powder.</p><p>“Wang haoxian, I hope you haven’t left yet!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. He left the cave abode and appeared outside the cliff. Then, he rose into the air. Now, he was going to take the initiative to look for Wang haoxian.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at high speed in the sky and circled the area.</p><p>More than an hour later, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. In front of him, a flash of fire was approaching at high speed. It was Wang haoxian.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve finally found you!”</p><p>Wang haoxian shrieked, his face twisted.</p><p>She was clearly beautiful, but at this moment, there was no sense of beauty.</p><p>“Wang haoxian, you’ve been chasing me for a few days, and you miss me so much? Why don’t you forget about your brother and become my concubine?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled, deliberately provoking Wang haoxian.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wang haoxian shouted angrily and rushed over at top speed. She did not think much about why Lu Ming did not run away. She was furious.</p><p>“I, Lu Ming, am a heaven-sent talent. I won’t let you down if you become my concubine.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to provoke Wang haoxian.</p><p>As expected, Wang haoxian was even more furious. He pounced on Lu Ming and threw a punch at him. The flames were burning and it was terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and struck out with his palm. In his palm, a wisp of dark Yin powder spread towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist and palm collided. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>He felt his qi and blood churning, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“I hope it’s useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>Wang haoxian was surrounded by raging flames that could burn everything. However, the dark Yin powder contained the Qi of the netherworld and was extremely cold. It could possibly resist the burning of flames.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>After Wang haoxian pushed Lu Ming back with one punch, he threw another punch. Lu Ming swung his palm again, and there was still a trace of dark Yin powder in his palm.</p><p>Wang haoxian was so angry that he didn’t notice it at all.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming and Wang haoxian exchanged five moves in a row. Lu Ming retreated five thousand meters and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>this won’t do. The dark Yin powder will probably take a while before it takes effect. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming turned and ran.</p><p>“You want to run? dream on!”</p><p>Wang haoxian gave chase.</p><p>The chase continued for a few thousand miles.</p><p>Wang haoxian, who was in pursuit, suddenly had a change in expression. His body trembled and he almost fell to the ground.</p><p>“It’s working!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He stopped and turned around to look at Wang haoxian with a cold smile.</p><p>“What did you do to me?”</p><p>Wang haoxian glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nothing much? It’s just a little bit of poison. Right now, do you feel like your body is soft and you can’t use your true Qi?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … Despicable!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face turned pale.</p><p>“Despicable? can I compare to your Wang clan in terms of despicability? Now, you’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and charged at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang Haotian gritted his teeth and turned to run.</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase.</p><p>However, Wang haoxian had been hit by the dark Yin powder, and it became more and more difficult for her to mobilize her vital essence. Her speed rapidly decreased, and slowly, she could not even fly. She landed on the ground, trembling all over, and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming landed as well. He took a step forward and threw a palm at Wang haoxian.</p><p>At this point, Wang haoxian could no longer use his true energy. He could only use his will to resist.</p><p>However, there was no vital essence, only the will, so the power was limited. Lu Ming destroyed Wang haoxian’s will with one palm. Wang haoxian grunted and flew far away. He fell to the ground and spat out blood, his face pale.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his killing intent surging.</p><p>Wang haoxian closed his eyes in despair. She did not expect that her revenge for Wang Haotian would not only fail to kill Lu Ming, but she would also lose her life.</p><p>However, she waited for a while and did not feel Lu Ming’s palm landing on her. She could not help but open her eyes and saw Lu Ming sizing her up carefully, an evil glint flashing in his eyes from time to time.</p><p>In her eyes, Lu Ming was shining with this kind of light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
