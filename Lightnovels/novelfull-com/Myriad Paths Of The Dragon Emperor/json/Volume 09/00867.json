Sunrise’s expression changed and he quickly retracted his mind power.</p><p>...</p><p>“Tianyun, if you have the ability, then go to the battle inscription platform and have a fair battle with me in the art of inscription!”</p><p>The rising sun stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>The battle inscription platform was the place where the talisman sect disciples competed in the battle inscription Dao.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Lu Ming left with these words and strode away.</p><p>During this period of time, the nine Dragons bloodline had been somewhat dispirited. Lu Ming was worried that there would be any aftereffects and had long wanted to try devouring the blood essence. Now that he had obtained the demonic beast blood essence with great difficulty, he could not wait to go back and try it out. He was not in the mood to go to the battle inscription platform to compete.</p><p>If it was something he could easily settle here, he wouldn’t mind.</p><p>Lu Ming left the treasure Pavilion and flew straight to Yun Feng residence.</p><p>Hmph, he’s just a coward. What right does he have to become a zongzi candidate? ”</p><p>Sunrise snorted coldly as he watched Lu Ming leave.</p><p>who knows what methods tianyun used to become a zongzi candidate? he’s clearly afraid of you, big brother, and doesn’t dare to fight you. He’ll give himself away if he does!</p><p>Xushan sneered.</p><p>In the hall of the treasure Pavilion, the others shook their heads as well. They thought that Lu Ming would not dare to compete with the rising sun.</p><p>This rumor had also spread throughout the entire Mount Liangyi.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to the cloud Peak Residence, he went straight to his room and sat cross-legged.</p><p>A Jade bottle appeared in his hand. There were nine drops of Pearl-like demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>It was the blood essence of a class 6 Lv 6 demonic beast.</p><p>With a thought, the bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged.</p><p>Nine silver chakra appeared around the nine Dragon bloodline. However, the light was dim, and the nine Dragon bloodline seemed to be a little dispirited.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his nine Dragon bloodline, opened his mouth, and swallowed the nine drops of demonic beast blood essence. He then began to refine them.</p><p>Slowly, the power of the demonic beast’s blood essence was absorbed by the nine Dragon bloodlines. The nine silver chakra slowly became brighter.</p><p>Two hours later, the first portion of blood essence was refined. Lu Ming took out another portion of sixth grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence and continued refining.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed. Lu Ming had refined more than ten portions of the demonic beast’s blood essence. Finally, the nine Dragons ‘bloodline regained its vitality. The nine silver chakra glowed brightly and the speed of refining the blood essence had increased by a notch.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>In four days, Lu Ming had refined all fifty portions of sixth grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence. However, his nine Dragon bloodline had not advanced to the divine level.</p><p>“What’s going on? I haven’t been able to level up even after devouring 50 portions of sixth grade demonic beast blood essence, and I’ve already reached the divine level before. Now, the amount of blood essence I’ve devoured has already exceeded the last time, so why haven’t I advanced?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>He was a little worried. Would the self-destruction of the chakra stop him from upgrading his nine Dragon bloodline? That would be a huge loss.</p><p>impossible, it must be because I haven’t devoured enough blood essence. Continue devouring!</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and took out a portion of seventh grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence, continuing to devour and refine it.</p><p>The blood essence of a class 7 Lv 6 demonic beast was four to five times thicker than that of a class 6 Lv 6 demonic beast.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to devour the blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming was so focused on refining the blood essence that he was unaware of the outside world.</p><p>In the past few days, tianyun’s name had been spreading like wildfire in Liangyi mountain.</p><p>On the second day of Lu Ming’s closed-door cultivation, other top 300 talents on the list of top 1000 talents challenged Lu Ming, but he did not accept the challenge.</p><p>Then, the rumors about Lu Ming not daring to accept the challenge and his low ability became more and more intense.</p><p>Later on, there were even geniuses who came to Yun Peak House and wanted to challenge Lu Ming. However, Bai chixue used the excuse that Lu Ming was in closed-door cultivation and activated the formation of Yun Peak House, turning him away.</p><p>In this way, the voices of cowardice and incompetence about Lu Ming avoiding the battle became stronger.</p><p>Some people even suggested to the elders to abolish Lu Ming’s zongzi position and make him move out of Yun Peak House. However, they were rejected immediately.</p><p>This made many geniuses grit their teeth. They were waiting for Lu Ming to appear and defeat him in public. That way, they would see if he still had the face to continue being a zongzi candidate.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in closed-door cultivation for seven days.</p><p>Lu Ming refined ten more portions of seventh grade sixth level blood essence.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally felt that his nine Dragon bloodline was about to level up.</p><p>this time, the amount of blood essence consumed is several times more than the last time. Is this the side effect? but as long as I can advance, it’s worth it. No matter how much blood essence I consume, it’s worth it.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>however, it will cause a huge commotion if I want to level up to a divine bloodline. I must find a secret place and ask Bai chixue if there are any secret places!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming went out of the room and saw Bai chixue in a daze, frowning.</p><p>“Chi Xue, why are you in a daze?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and smiled.</p><p>it’s all because of you. During this period of time, everyone came to challenge you, but you hid away to cultivate. I got rid of all of them!</p><p>Bai chixue glared at Lu Ming and pouted.</p><p>“Challenge me? I knew it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He already knew that many people would challenge him. It would be strange if he didn’t.</p><p>“What are your plans? Are we going to go out and fight them?”</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>“I’m not free right now. I’m going into closed-door cultivation for a while. When I come out, I’ll pack up.” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Clean them up together? You’re very confident. There are heaven’s pride experts who are close to the top 100 in this list. Although the talisman sect is not as powerful as the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect, there are still more than 30 people who are ranked between the 100th and 300th on the list of top 1000 talents. These are all your enemies, can you handle them?”</p><p>Bai chixue obviously did not believe him.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. is there a quiet place here where no one will disturb you? a place where you can cultivate in seclusion without causing a big impact? ”</p><p>yes, the wind martial cave. It’s not very useful for the cultivation of the Dao of inscription, so few people go there. Moreover, it’s full of caves. You can just pick one and no one will know no matter how big a commotion you cause!</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>“Alright, the wind martial cave it is. I’ll go and cultivate in seclusion for a while!” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming left the cloud Peak Residence. Following the map, he turned into a rainbow and headed towards the wind martial cave.</p><p>The wind martial cave was hundreds of thousands of miles away. With Lu Ming’s speed, he arrived very quickly.</p><p>The wind martial cave was filled with strange rocks. There were huge stone mountains over 10000 meters high everywhere. There were huge caves on the mountains, and strong wind blew out from them.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in, randomly chose a cave, and flew in.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was fast, the fact that he had entered the wind martial cave was still discovered by others. Immediately, the news spread throughout the Liangyi mountain.</p><p>“We’ve finally left Yun Peak House!”</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites ‘eyes lit up when they heard the news. They started to move and headed towards the wind martial cave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
