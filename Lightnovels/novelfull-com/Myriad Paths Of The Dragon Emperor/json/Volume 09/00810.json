If he were to hunt them and devour their blood essence by himself, the speed would be too slow.</p><p>With Wang haoxian, he could put more energy into cultivation.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>Wang haoxian said through gritted teeth.</p><p>This request was not difficult and she could accept it. She was just afraid that Lu Ming would make some unreasonable requests.</p><p>In seven days, she had to hand over seven portions of demonic beast blood essence at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm and above. On average, she only had to kill one fifth level spiritual ocean realm demonic beast a day. This wasn’t difficult for her.</p><p>we’ll meet here in seven days. If you don’t show up, I’ll take it as you’ve betrayed me and I’ll activate the soul splitting formation!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. With that, his figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. His body trembled violently and his beautiful face was twisted.</p><p>She hated it, she was angry.</p><p>After a while, she took a deep breath and calmed herself down.</p><p>She planned to listen to Lu Ming’s instructions for the time being. In the future, she would find an opportunity to get the method to break the array from Lu Ming and then kill him.</p><p>But he had to endure the humiliation first.</p><p>Thinking of this, she completely calmed down. With a flash, she also left the place to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know what Wang haoxian was thinking. Even if he did, he would not care. He was confident that he would surpass Wang haoxian in terms of combat power after some time.</p><p>When he returned to nine suns Supreme’s cave abode, he was still sitting cross-legged under the soul condensing tree. It seemed that he would need some time.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of raw gemstones and sat cross-legged. His nine Dragon bloodline appeared and he devoured a hundred raw gemstones in one go.</p><p>After that, he would refine it with all his might and increase his true essence.</p><p>After refining a hundred pieces, another hundred pieces were refined.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the spirit sea, the waves roared and the rivers and seas churned.</p><p>When Lu Ming had refined eight hundred raw gemstones, the area of his spirit sea had doubled once again. Lu Ming’s cultivation had entered the third level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>After that, he continued to refine the raw gemstones.</p><p>Another four days passed, and Lu Ming’s cultivation rose to the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>At the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm, Lu Ming had reached a bottleneck. If he wanted to continue improving, he had to cultivate the earth and Thunder concepts to the second level small completion before he could continue to improve.</p><p>seven days have passed. Let’s go and see if Wang haoxian has obtained the blood essence of the demonic beast!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He left the cave abode and went to the place where he had agreed to meet Wang haoxian.</p><p>From a distance, they could see Wang haoxian sitting cross-legged, his body covered in a layer of fire, like a goddess of fire.</p><p>To be honest, Wang haoxian, who was cultivating with his eyes closed and no killing intent around him, was still very beautiful. The flames around him danced, giving off a kind of illusionary feeling.</p><p>Wang haoxian opened his eyes when Lu Ming arrived.</p><p>“Have you obtained the demonic beast blood essence?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>“Here you go!”</p><p>With a wave of Wang haoxian’s hand, seven Jade bottles flew towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming picked up one of the bottles and saw nine drops of blood essence that looked like blood-red pearls. They were demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of demonic beasts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm and above, if taken out and sealed in a Jade bottle, could be preserved for a month without dissipating.</p><p>The more powerful an existence was, the stronger the energy and activity of the blood essence, and the longer it could be preserved.</p><p>Wang haoxian turned and left after throwing the blood essence to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Wang haoxian shuddered. He turned around and looked at Lu Ming.”What do you want now?”</p><p>don’t forget your identity. You’re my servant now. Is this how a servant should treat her master? ”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p><p>Wang haoxian gritted his teeth and glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Wang haoxian said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“A servant girl should have the attitude of a servant girl. Otherwise, I’ll make you warm my bed.”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into an evil smile.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face was red with anger. He looked at her with his big eyes and finally gave in. He bowed slightly and said through gritted teeth, ” “Young master Lu Ming … Young master, I … This servant will take her leave!”</p><p>It seemed to take all of Wang haoxian’s strength to say this. She panted slightly.</p><p>besides, you were not sincere enough. If you gnash your teeth like this, people who don’t know you will think that you are going to eat me. They will think that there is some deep hatred between us. Speak properly, and remember, your attitude must be sincere. You must treat me as a young master from the bottom of your heart, a young master that you respect, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to give instructions.</p><p>Wang haoxian almost vomited blood.</p><p>She was roaring in her heart. There was already a deep hatred between the two of us, alright? And sincere? how?</p><p>If she was not controlled by the array, she would have chopped Lu Ming into eight pieces. How could she be so sincere?</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, I’ll take my leave!”</p><p>Wang haoxian took a deep breath and spoke. His voice was softer than before.</p><p>forget it, it’s just so-so. You should practice more in the future. Go!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands in dissatisfaction.</p><p>This made Wang haoxian’s body fluctuate again. She kept telling herself to endure. She must endure. Only by enduring would she have a chance to seek revenge on Lu Ming.</p><p>After Wang haoxian left, Lu Ming returned to his cave abode.</p><p>Then, he opened the seven Jade bottles one by one.</p><p>Of the seven portions of blood essence, five were at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and two were at the sixth level.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and sucked, swallowing all 70% of the blood essence and starting to refine it.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had used all the power of blood essence to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>He would first upgrade his nine Dragon bloodline to the divine level. Once the nine Dragon bloodline upgraded to the divine level, he would have two divine level bloodlines, and his combat power would be even stronger.</p><p>In less than a day, 70% of his blood essence had been refined.</p><p>Clearly, this blood essence was still not enough to advance the nine Dragon bloodline to the divine bloodline.</p><p>senior Jiuyang will need some time to recover here. Little Qing and fatty are not in danger now, so it’s best for them to cultivate here. I’ll just cultivate here!</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the ground, thinking about the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps isn’t far from the fifth step. There’s also the three absolutes of the Dragon God. I’ll have to find time to integrate the earth will into it. This way, I’ll have another way to fight my enemies. Of course, the most important thing is the comprehension of the will!</p><p>“Also, I can’t neglect the Dao of inscription!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s fingers glowed and the infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, you have a lot of precious metals here. You can use them to refine the infinite Dragon Spear!”</p><p>With a thought, a piece of metal appeared in his hand.</p><p>This piece of metal was called Star Moon iron. On it, there were patterns that looked like stars. It was very beautiful.</p><p>A blue mental energy fire appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. It wrapped around the star Moon iron and started burning.</p><p>Not long after, the star Moon iron softened and finally turned into a pool of liquid that wrapped around the infinite Dragon Spear. Lu Ming waved his fingers and runes bloomed in the air, flying toward the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>As the inscriptions were carved, the star Moon iron was slowly integrated into the infinite Dragon Spear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
