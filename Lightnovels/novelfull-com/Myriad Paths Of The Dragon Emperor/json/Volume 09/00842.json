They felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them, as if a great disaster was about to befall them.</p><p>...</p><p>not good, the venerable one is about to show his might. Let’s retreat!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>A series of terrified screams rang out in the surroundings, and countless figures were forced to retreat like ants.</p><p>“I’ve already spared you once, but you still don’t know how to repent. Then I’ll behead you!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! the venerable protector reached out his palm and struck down.</p><p>A dazzling sword light appeared and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The sound of space tearing was heard. The sword light slashed down, directly tearing the space apart, and a dark spatial crack appeared.</p><p>In the distance, countless people widened their eyes. It was said that the spiritual God Realm Masters could really break open space and tear open space cracks. However, if there was no major battle, ordinary people would not have the opportunity to see the spiritual God Realm Masters in action.</p><p>Now, he had finally seen it. It was just like the rumors.</p><p>How terrifying was the power of a palm that could break space? How could Lu Ming resist it?</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar. He grabbed the legs of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron with both hands and actually lifted it up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron crashed toward the sword light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword radiance hit the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, but it only made a sound and was destroyed. There was not a trace of damage on the cauldron.</p><p>“Hand over little Qing!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. He grabbed the cauldron and strode forward. Then, he lifted the cauldron and smashed it at The Guardian like a hammer.</p><p>“Evil creature!”</p><p>die! the Dharma Protector roared as his hair and beard stood up. His aura became even more terrifying. A giant sword appeared in his hand. As he crazily poured in his true essence, the giant sword grew to 10000 meters long. Like a divine sword, it slashed toward the giant cauldron.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The 10,000-meter-long sword collided with the cauldron, creating an earth-shaking boom. A storm of energy tore through the sky, leaving a black crack.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi slashed down on the ground, creating a crack that was hundreds of miles long.</p><p>It was too terrifying. Such a great battle could definitely destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>A figure stepped in the air and staggered.</p><p>It was the venerable Guardian, a spiritual God Realm powerhouse. He was actually forced to retreat.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Everyone could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming, a young man in his twenties with the cultivation of the spiritual ocean tier, had actually lifted the cauldron and repelled a powerful spiritual God Realm expert. This was too unbelievable and felt unreal, as if he was dreaming.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes widened, and he was almost scared to death.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty’s protector was actually forced back by Lu Ming. If the cauldron were to smash at him, wouldn’t he be turned into ashes?</p><p>His back was drenched in cold sweat as he retreated towards the ocean waves ancient garden. The ocean waves ancient garden had an extremely powerful formation, so it would be safe.</p><p>“Hand over little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and the huge cauldron smashed at The Guardian again.</p><p>die! Guardian Knight roared. A giant sword with five golden chakras appeared above his head.</p><p>This was the bloodline of a Guardian Knight, a fifth level divine level expert. This bloodline was already extremely terrifying when it was unleashed by a spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>The Guardian’s figure rushed into the huge sword. The huge sword whistled and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming lifted the huge cauldron and smashed it down.</p><p>There was another deafening roar, shaking the heavens and earth. The giant sword was deflected away, but Lu Ming also staggered back. His qi and blood were in turmoil, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that when he spat out a mouthful of blood, it was directly absorbed by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron glowed and Lu Ming felt that the weight of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had become lighter. It was more convenient for him to swing it.</p><p>He took a step forward, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron once again smashed toward the venerable Guardian.</p><p>The huge sword shook and collided with the huge cauldron.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, the giant sword was sent flying hundreds of miles away. It turned back into a human and crashed into the ground, creating an unfathomably deep pit.</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded. Lu Ming was simply going against the heavens. He had actually beaten a spiritual God Realm powerhouse to the point where he was half dead.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pay any more attention to The Guardian. He carried the huge cauldron and walked towards the ocean waves ancient garden step by step.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re really audacious!”</p><p>“He should be killed!”</p><p>kill! two shouts came from the ocean waves ancient garden. Two figures rushed out of the garden and stood in the void.</p><p>These two old men exuded terrifying auras that were no weaker than the venerable Guardian’s. In fact, they were even stronger.</p><p>There was more than one spiritual God Realm expert from the ancient Sage dynasty of the central continent.</p><p>These two old men were also powerful cultivators from the Gu Empire of the central continent.</p><p>The two elders appeared and charged at Lu Ming without a word.</p><p>I told you to hand over Xiao Qing. Otherwise, I’ll raze the ocean waves ancient garden to the ground today!</p><p>A low roar came from Lu Ming’s mouth, and his eyes revealed a crazed look.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He was fearless. He carried the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and started a shocking battle with the two elders.</p><p>More and more people came from all directions, but no one dared to come within three thousand miles.</p><p>A spiritual God-level battle was too shocking. Anyone below the spiritual God Realm would only die if they got close.</p><p>In a room deep within the Hailan gardens, Xie nianqing was sitting cross-legged on the bed. Her aura was extremely weak. Her true essence and spirit Fire had been sealed. She looked like an ordinary person.</p><p>She sat on the bed quietly, her eyes filled with longing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how are you?”</p><p>“I originally thought that with the battle of karmic luck drawing near, those fellows wouldn’t come again. I didn’t expect that it would still come. I can’t hide from it. ”</p><p>“I don’t want to go back. I don’t want to go back to that home, that disgusting home!”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent had a long history. Legend had it that it had been passed down from the ancient times for countless years.</p><p>The Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty had the bloodline of the ancient human Emperor. The bloodline that they awakened was a pure and holy bloodline. However, Xie nianqing had awakened the heavenly demon bloodline. To the pure and holy Xie family, it was a lowly and dirty bloodline.</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing’s mother was only a maidservant. Her father had given birth to Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, after Xie nianqing awakened his foreign bloodline, her mother was regarded as a heretic and killed.</p><p>After all, Xie nianqing was the descendant of the Emperor of the ancient Saint dynasty, which was why he managed to survive.</p><p>However, she was mocked and humiliated. Xie nianqing had lived in the shadow of that family since she was young. She hated that family and wanted to escape.</p><p>In the Xie family of the ancient sacred dynasty, there were also examples like her in history. The back of the so-called light was darkness.</p><p>Among the divine bloodlines, there would occasionally be a completely dark bloodline.</p><p>In history, there had been such a bloodline that had caused chaos in the world and almost destroyed the Gu dynasty.</p><p>As such, all those with such a strange bloodline had a miserable ending.</p><p>Xie nianqing hated that family because of her mother. She also knew that if she continued to stay in that family, she would not have a good ending.</p><p>In the dark, there were countless people who wanted to get rid of her.</p><p>That was why she wanted to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
