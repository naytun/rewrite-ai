The inscriptions on his body became even more dazzling. Even his eyes were emitting sword Qi.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, his entire body seemed to have turned into a killing formation. Endless sword light burst out from his body. It was as if every inch of his skin could burst out sword light.</p><p>It was like a moving level-seven array that was charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion was heard. The two top-notch level-six formations that Lu Ming had set up were destroyed by Ji mai in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quickly. His feet and hands did not stop at all, and runes continued to fill the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another top-notch grade level-six formation appeared, but Ji mai strode forward. Wherever he passed by, he destroyed everything. Sword Qi was everywhere and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>At this moment, Ji Mai’s combat strength was no weaker than an ordinary first level spirit embryo realm martial artist.</p><p>A peak grade level 6 formation was destroyed in just a few breaths.</p><p>tianyun is going to be defeated. A peak grade grade grade grade grade 6 formation is simply unable to stop him!</p><p>that’s right. The time he took to inscribe the formation is not as long as the time Ji mai took to destroy it. He is already at a disadvantage and can’t hold on for much longer!</p><p>“It’s a pity that tianyun didn’t seem to have made sufficient preparations before taking part in the competition. Didn’t you all notice? He didn’t prepare any puppets, nor did he prepare any inscription scrolls!”</p><p>indeed. If we’re well-prepared, we might be able to fight!</p><p>Other people, such as the puppet sect, would prepare many puppets before participating in the competition. The talisman sect would also inscribe many inscription talismans. However, Lu Ming did not seem to have any.</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed not prepared.</p><p>He did have some inscription scrolls, but the highest was only at stage six and stage nine, which was not very useful.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another top-tier level-six formation was destroyed by Ji mai.</p><p>“Tianyun, just admit defeat. You’re not my match!”</p><p>Ji Mai’s voice came.</p><p>“Oh, really? This is exactly what I wanted to say!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled and suddenly stopped inscribing inscriptions.</p><p>Around them, many people were stunned. They did not understand why Lu Ming suddenly stopped. From what he said, it seemed that he wanted to ask Ji mai to admit defeat. What was going on?</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Some of the spiritual God Realm elders ‘eyes flickered as if they had seen through something. They were extremely surprised.</p><p>“Then let’s see what other tricks you have up your sleeve!”</p><p>Ji mai strode forward and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a light step forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the fighting ring, a huge array appeared.</p><p>In the midst of the dazzling light, countless pillars of fire shot out.</p><p>The pillars of fire criss-crossed and formed a huge cage, trapping Ji mai within.</p><p>Sword radiance burst out from Ji Mai’s body and slashed at the fire pillars. There was a loud bang but the fire pillars did not move at all.</p><p>He couldn’t cut it!</p><p>“A level Seven formation!”</p><p>Ji Mai’s expression changed.</p><p>“A level Seven formation array, it’s a level Seven formation array-Heavenly Fire prison!”</p><p>Someone shouted, recognizing this formation.</p><p>“Heavens! When did tianyun inscribe a Grade 7 formation?”</p><p>he must have inscribed it when he was inscribing the level six formation. Amazing, he inscribed the level Seven formation while inscribing the level six formation. He used those level six formations to stop Ji mai and perfected the level Seven formation. This is too terrifying!</p><p>&Nbsp; many people in the surroundings began to roar in shock.</p><p>It was already an impressive feat for a level-six Alchemist to inscribe a level-seven array. However, Lu Ming had completed it in a great battle. He had completed it step by step in a great battle with a powerful opponent like Ji mai. The short time he took was shocking.</p><p>This was a complete Level Seven formation-Heavenly Fire prison. The formation that Ji mai carved with his body was incomplete and could not unleash its full power. It could not break Lu Ming’s formation at all.</p><p>“Ji mai, how is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood outside the array and his voice was heard.</p><p>The light on Ji Mai’s body dimmed and he sighed, ” “I admit defeat!”</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming had gone easy on him. If Lu Ming had inscribed a level-seven killing array, he would have been defeated and killed.</p><p>The heavenly Fire prison was only a trap formation to trap him.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Then, with a wave of his hand, the inscriptions were hidden, and the fire pillar disappeared.</p><p>“Tianyun wins this battle!”</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>With Meng Chong’s announcement, the square was in an uproar.</p><p>Clearly, this result was completely out of everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Before the competition began, no one had expected such a result.</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin stood up from his seat and pressed his hands in the air. All the voices in the hall quieted down.</p><p>I hereby announce that the champion of this competition is tianyun!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice was like a hurricane, spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Tianyun, tianyun!”</p><p>In a certain area, a group of beautiful women were screaming loudly, their faces red with excitement.</p><p>“Also, tianyun is the zongzi candidate. Do you have any objections?”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice was heard again.</p><p>The entire place suddenly fell silent. All eyes were focused on Lu Ming again.</p><p>Their gazes were a little complicated. Tianyun was such a genius, what else could they say? This time, he had already proven himself with his own strength.</p><p>Not only was he a monster in martial arts, but even his Dao of inscription was so terrifying. How many people could there be in the world?</p><p>“Sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>It was Bai chixue. She raised her hand and shouted.</p><p>“Sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>“Sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>In a certain area, a group of women screamed loudly.</p><p>This time, the shouts grew louder and louder, gradually drawing the attention of the others. Be it a few young male disciples, female disciples, or even some of the older generation, everyone was shouting the words ” sky cloud zongzi “.</p><p>In the crowd, sunrise, Feng tai, and the others had extremely complicated expressions.</p><p>Before the competition, they were prepared to humiliate Lu Ming in the competition to avenge their defeat. But what happened in the end?</p><p>In the three rounds of the competition, not only did they fail to humiliate Lu Ming, but they were also humiliated by him. In the end, the Halo around Lu Ming became even more dazzling and dazzling.</p><p>In comparison, they were like fireflies. There was no way to compare.</p><p>“Sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>They laughed bitterly, and finally, they joined the crowd in shouting.</p><p>Lu Ming surveyed his surroundings. At this moment, his gaze was very calm and his heart was calm.</p><p>He was very clear about his goal.</p><p>Right now, he could only be considered to have obtained the preliminary approval of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>However, this was only the beginning. He was still far from being able to truly gain the support of these people.</p><p>This was especially true for the elders in the sky.</p><p>His goal was the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>His true goal was to be the champion of the battle of Providence.</p><p>Only by doing so could he gain a firm foothold on Mount Liangyi and the talisman Amulet sect. Only then could he truly obtain the support of this force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
