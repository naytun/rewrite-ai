No one knew which cave Lu Ming had entered. They could only wait outside.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered a cave, he kept going deeper.</p><p>“Such dense spiritual Qi of heaven and earth!”</p><p>As Lu Ming ran forward, a look of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>In the cave, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was extremely rich. However, the talisman Amulet sect mainly cultivated the Dao of inscription, so the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was not very useful. Therefore, very few people came to the wind martial cave.</p><p>After Lu Ming had travelled tens of thousands of meters, he came to an underground cave. Then, he waved his hands and runes were inserted into the surroundings, setting up a large array.</p><p>The main purpose of this formation was to isolate sound, in case the breakthrough would cause too much of a commotion.</p><p>After inscribing the formation, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged.</p><p>let’s upgrade the bloodline of the nine Dragons in one fell swoop!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. This time, he took out ten portions of seventh grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence. The nine Dragon bloodlines opened their mouths and roared, devouring the ten portions of blood essence and refining them. The rich power of the blood essence gushed into the nine Dragon bloodlines continuously.</p><p>A day later, the bloodline of the nine yang roared into the sky. The Dragon roars were continuous, and the surroundings were covered in light, isolating the sound in the cave.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dragon roars were heard as the body of the nine Dragon bloodline continued to grow. Originally, the nine Dragon bloodline had turned back into the appearance of a flood Dragon with only four dragon claws on its abdomen. But now, the fifth dragon Claw had extended.</p><p>He transformed into a true dragon.</p><p>But it wasn’t over yet. After the fifth dragon Claw extended, the sixth Dragon Claw followed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock. The advancement this time seemed to be different from the previous time.</p><p>After the sixth Dragon Claw extended, the Dragon roar became even louder, and the aura of the nine Dragon bloodline became even stronger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, the seventh Dragon Claw reached out again, then the eighth, and the ninth.</p><p>A total of nine dragon claws!</p><p>Nine Dragons. Lu Ming’s bloodline had completely transformed into the legendary Nine Dragons.</p><p>The nine-clawed true dragon was called the nine Dragons. It was a mutated existence among the true dragons. It was extremely powerful, far more powerful than ordinary true dragons. It was a unique existence in the world and also one of the top ten war beasts mentioned by dandan.</p><p>After the nine Dragon bloodline exploded its chakra, it advanced once again and directly evolved into the form of Nine Dragons.</p><p>This was the complete bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>After a moment of shock, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and the nine silver chakras merged into one, turning into a golden chakra. The powerful dragon power spread out and shocked the world.</p><p>However, the yin and yang mountain was protected by a powerful formation. The auras of the nine Dragons were completely isolated. No one outside the mountain could feel them.</p><p>the devouring power is several times stronger than when I was in my true dragon form!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and was overjoyed.</p><p>He realized that the devouring power of the nine Dragons was several times stronger than the true dragon form.</p><p>This time, it was really a blessing in disguise. After the nine Dragon bloodline exploded its Meridian cycle and advanced again, it actually awakened the perfect form of Nine Dragons.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming put away the nine Dragon bloodline. He realized that there was also a dragon energy condensed at his spine.</p><p>I wonder what’s the difference between this dragon power and the previous dragon power? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while. Then, he had an idea and his dragon power burst out.</p><p>A layer of purple-gold scale armor emerged on Lu Ming’s skin like a suit of armor. It looked extremely demonic.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock. He felt that his body was filled with energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a punch, the space quickly condensed into a ball and turned into a terrifying energy, blasting forward.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He activated the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and appeared in front of the ball of energy in an instant. He threw a punch and blocked it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was forced to take eight steps back.</p><p>so strong! He’s too strong!</p><p>Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>He couldn’t experiment to his heart’s content here. Otherwise, the entire mountain would explode.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could still feel the immense power.</p><p>This dragon energy was definitely stronger than his previous dragon energy. It was at least a few times stronger. When the Dragon energy burst out, Lu Ming’s attack and defense would be greatly improved.</p><p>The Dragon power in the past was the power of a real Dragon, but the current dragon power could be said to be the power of Nine Dragons. It was normal for it to be stronger.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi, I bet you didn’t expect that my self-destruction of my Meridian cycles would help me in the end. It allowed me to exert the power of the nine Dragon bloodline to the extreme!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and there was a smile on his lips.</p><p>however, I’ll probably need even more blood essence to transform into the nine Dragons. I still have 30 portions of tier 7 sixth level blood essence left. I’ll upgrade the prison suppressing stele bloodline first. After I upgrade the prison suppressing stele bloodline to the third level of the divine level, I’ll then upgrade the nine Dragons bloodline!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming continued to take out the blood essence and began to devour it.</p><p>With the advancement of the nine Dragon bloodline, the devouring and refining power had reached a terrifying level, and the speed of refining demonic beast blood essence had become even faster.</p><p>In just a few hours, 30 portions of blood essence of Class 7 Lv 6 had been refined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele shook and shone brightly. Two golden chakras glittered. Suddenly, a golden chakra emerged above the two golden chakra.</p><p>Three golden chakra, divine level rank three bloodline.</p><p>When the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline advanced to the third level of the divine level, the power of the prison suppressing heavenly technique would also increase, and it would reach the highest level of an upper-grade demigod martial technique.</p><p>if I use my full power now and combine it with my dragon power, how powerful will my attack be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was suspended in the air. Lu Ming stepped on the ground and his entire person became one with the earth.</p><p>“What Is This Feeling?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He quickly closed his eyes and began to comprehend.</p><p>Just now, when the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was advancing, he was connected to the earth and suddenly felt something.</p><p>This was a kind of inspiration. Some people also called it a kind of enlightenment. It required a chance coincidence to capture this feeling and enter a wonderful state.</p><p>This kind of opportunity was hard to come by. Lu Ming closed his eyes and seemed to sink into the depths of the earth, becoming one with it. He was the earth, and the earth was him.</p><p>The earth was thick, vast, ancient, and eternal.</p><p>The earth was silent and unending. It contained all living things, moved, suppressed everything, and buried the heaven and earth. It was an extremely powerful intent realm of the heaven and earth.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming immersed himself in the comprehension of the earth essence realm. Time passed slowly.</p><p>One day, two days …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. Lu Ming was immersed in his comprehension. It had already been five days. His comprehension of the earth concept had improved by leaps and bounds. Not only did he break through to level two upper tier, but he was also approaching level two completion.</p><p>Five days ‘time was equivalent to several months of hard work. At this moment, the area outside the wind martial cave was already packed with people.</p><p>Many paragons had rushed here to wait for Lu Ming to come out.</p><p>There were even more people who came to watch the show.</p><p>“Hmph! I’ll wait here and see how long Lu Ming can hide.”</p><p>Sunrise said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
