Even the lightning bird had been defeated, so what could they do?</p><p>In the sky, the Golden-robed young man’s expression was unsightly.</p><p>Fatty and the others cheered.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s really lively here today!”</p><p>At this moment, a faint voice came from the distant sky.</p><p>This voice clearly came from a distance, but it seemed to ring in everyone’s ears.</p><p>In the crowd, Xie nianqing’s expression changed when he heard the voice. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>A total of five people stepped through the air.</p><p>Three of the five were young men.</p><p>There were two men and a woman. Among the three young men, it was obvious that the young man in the purple-and-gold robe was the leader. Another man and a woman stood behind the young man.</p><p>There were two old men beside the young man in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>The two old men gave people the feeling that they were ordinary people. They were like two ordinary old men who didn’t know martial arts. There was no aura coming from their bodies.</p><p>Naturally, they could not be truly ordinary people. Their cultivation was too high, giving others an illusion.</p><p>The two old men chatted and laughed as they looked down. One of the old men seemed to be introducing something to the other.</p><p>“Then … That seems to be black wind Knight!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>“What? Black wind Knight, the black wind Knight of the Imperial sky guards?”</p><p>that’s him. I’ve seen him once. It’s really black wind Knight!</p><p>As soon as he said that, it caused more exclamations. Countless eyes turned to one of the black-robed elders.</p><p>A venerable, it was actually a venerable.</p><p>venerable ” was a respectful title for a spiritual God Realm master. In other words, this black-robed old man was a peerless master in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, martial emperors were the strongest. At the Martial Emperor realm, they dominated the world.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm was the closest realm to the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Usually, it was rare to see one, but at this time, one had appeared.</p><p>Then who were the other people? He actually wanted a venerable to accompany him.</p><p>The arrival of black wind Knight eased the tense atmosphere on the fighting ring.</p><p>greetings, black wind Knight!</p><p>The paragons of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace stood up and paid their respects.</p><p>no need to be so polite. We have an important guest here today. I heard that there is an exchange meeting here, so I brought him here to take a look!</p><p>Black wind Knight said with a smile.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Honored guest? Who could be called a distinguished guest by black wind venerable?</p><p>The paragons of the four overlords of the eastern barren territory, the sky corpse sect and the sky demon Valley, were all here. Naturally, they were not from either side.</p><p>Talisman sect?</p><p>Impossible. The talisman Amulet sect was in decline. It was not qualified to be called an honored guest by supremacy hei Fengyun.</p><p>Other than the three forces, who else in the eastern barren territory was qualified to be called a distinguished guest by the venerable black wind?</p><p>“They are from the central continent!”</p><p>Black wind Knight said with a smile.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, including the paragons of the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was divided into five huge regions.</p><p>Central continent, Eastern barren, Southern nether, Western Desert, Northern Plains.</p><p>The central continent had been the most prosperous and powerful region among the five regions since ancient times.</p><p>The central continent was a vast land with many talents and experts, it was the best in the five regions.</p><p>These people were actually from the central continent.</p><p>these people are from the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent. This is a Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty!</p><p>Black wind Knight even threw out a bombshell.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Those who knew the distribution of forces in the central continent were even more shocked.</p><p>The central continent was different from the eastern barren territory, where the four forces ruled.</p><p>The central continent’s ancient Saint dynasty had been passed down for countless years. It had suppressed the entire central continent and unified it. The entire central continent was under the control of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>It was said that the secret Chamber of Commerce was established by the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent.</p><p>Even though some people had heard that the situation in the central continent had changed and that the royal family had weakened, the ancient Saint dynasty was still the most powerful force.</p><p>The young man in the purple and gold robe was a Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty. No wonder black wind Knight called him an important guest.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Back then, Lian Cang had mentioned that Xie nianqing was from the central continent. However, Xie nianqing did not go into detail when Lu Ming asked him.</p><p>The purple-robed young man took a step forward and cupped his fists. I’m Xie Zhen, a Prince. I heard that all the top talents of the East barren are gathered here today, so I came to take a look. I hope I didn’t disturb you!</p><p>Your Highness is too polite. I am di Feng!</p><p>Di Feng stepped forward and cupped his fists. “So it’s brother di, nice to meet you!”</p><p>Xie Zhen returned the greeting with a smile.</p><p>Then, Shi mo and the Golden-robed young man from the heavenly Demon tribe greeted Xie Zhen.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent was not to be underestimated, and they naturally wanted to build a good relationship with it.</p><p>The eastern barren territory was vast, with hundreds of large regions.</p><p>However, geniuses on the level of di Feng, Shi mo, and the Golden-robed young man would have limitless potential. If they reached a certain level, they would be able to clash with the geniuses of the other regions.</p><p>Now that they had the chance to befriend the Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty, they would not miss it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m leaving. Let’s leave this place together!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard Xie nianqing’s voice. His voice was filled with anxiety.</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and saw Xie nianqing hiding in the crowd. His eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He sent a voice transmission to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Let’s go, there’s no time to explain!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure kept retreating in the crowd, as if he wanted to quietly leave this place.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the sky, Xie Zhen suddenly frowned. Then, his eyes lit up and he turned around. His eyes were filled with two rays of light as he looked in Xie nianqing’s direction.</p><p>haha, little sister, why didn’t you say hello when you saw your brother? you still want to leave quietly? ”</p><p>Xie Zhen laughed and in a flash, he appeared above Xie nianqing’s head.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned pale.</p><p>One of the old men and the two young men behind Xie Zhen also looked at Xie nianqing with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings was stunned and revealed doubtful expressions.</p><p>Xie Zhen called her little sister?</p><p>Could it be that Xie Zhen’s younger sister was still here? When did Xie Zhen’s sister get mixed up in the crowd?</p><p>The crowd followed Xie Zhen’s gaze and finally landed on Xie nianqing.</p><p>“It’s her?”</p><p>At this moment, many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>it’s actually her. The lady who has been walking with Lu Ming is actually Xie Zhen’s younger sister? ”</p><p>doesn’t that mean that she is the princess of the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, fatty, and the rest also looked at Xie nianqing in shock.</p><p>Xie nianqing actually had such an identity?</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little stunned. Although he had always felt that Xie nianqing’s identity was very mysterious and had some speculations, he did not expect that she was the princess of the ancient Sage dynasty of the central continent.</p><p>The scenes of the past could not help but surface in Lu Ming’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
