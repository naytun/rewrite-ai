After all, Lu Ming had only just arrived. He had only managed to become a zongzi because of Yan kuangtu and the martial prowess of the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>If he had come alone, it would be impossible for these big shots to compromise, and he would not have the chance to show off.</p><p>He would first obtain the zongzi candidate position, then he would have to fight for it himself.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Du songjue and the rest nodded. Lu Ming’s neither arrogant nor impatient attitude made everyone satisfied.</p><p>first of all, I’ll make you a zongzi candidate. However, if you want to become an official zongzi and take charge of the talisman Amulet sect in the future, there’s one more condition!</p><p>Du songjue said slowly.</p><p>It’s here!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He understood that there would definitely be conditions. It would not be that simple.</p><p>“Senior, please speak!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>the condition is that you must stand out in the upcoming battle of Providence and win first place. That way, you can immediately become an official zongzi after the battle of Providence ends!</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>The sect Masters and elders of the talisman sect, talisman sect, and puppet sect stared at Lu Ming without blinking.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could speak, Yan kuangtu roared,”What? The first place in the battle of Providence? How was this possible? Lu Ming has only cultivated for a short period of time. You are deliberately making things difficult for him. This condition is too difficult. Change it!”</p><p>First place in the battle of Providence?</p><p>Even though Yan kuangtu was mentally prepared, he was still shocked.</p><p>He did not doubt Lu Ming’s talent. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation time was still slightly shorter than the other geniuses.</p><p>The top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents were all crazy, especially the top 10, who were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Furthermore, there were also many newly emerged heaven’s favorites who were extremely brilliant. No one knew how strong they were.</p><p>And this was the human race. The heavenly monster tribe had many descendants with powerful bloodlines. It was too difficult to win first place.</p><p>This was simply deliberately making things difficult for him.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, this condition is difficult, but it’s even more difficult to break through to the Martial Emperor realm and compete with Di Yi.</p><p>“The martial Royal realm only appears once every few thousand years in the eastern barren territory. How many heaven’s favorites have been born in the past few thousand years? Even if this generation is a Golden Age with many geniuses, there are only a few who can break through to the Martial Emperor realm in the future. Lu Ming must suppress this era so that he can have a chance to break through to the Martial Emperor realm in the future. Only then will he have a chance to compete with or even defeat Di Yi!”</p><p>Meng Chong’s eyes were bright as he shouted.</p><p>Yan kuangtu remained silent. He knew that Meng Chong’s words made sense.</p><p>“Good! I agree!”</p><p>A clear voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up and they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the hall quietly, his body straight. His eyes were filled with determination and confidence.</p><p>First place in the battle of Providence? He had to do it, and he had to do it. As Meng Chong had said, if he couldn’t do it, how could he fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi?</p><p>Anyone who had reached the martial Royal realm was a legend.</p><p>And he wanted to create his own legend.</p><p>Although he knew it would be difficult, he was motivated only when there was pressure.</p><p>alright, it’s a deal then. If you can obtain first place in the battle of Providence, you will definitely bring great luck to the talisman Amulet sect. When that time comes, I will not go back on my words and will definitely assist you to become the sect leader. Anyone who wants to stop you will have to go through me first.</p><p>Du songjue stood up, his voice resounding and powerful.</p><p>In the past, the puppet sect wanted to seek refuge with Martial Emperor Di Yi because they were afraid that the talisman sect would be destroyed. They just wanted to leave behind some of their descendants, not because they were really afraid of death.</p><p>“That’s what I wanted to say. Moreover, Lu Ming, if you really get first place, I believe that no one in the talisman Amulet sect will be unconvinced!”</p><p>Bai Shijin also said.</p><p>The other elders also nodded.</p><p>“Seniors, don’t worry. Lu Ming will definitely do it!” Lu Ming’s voice was firm.</p><p>“Okay, it’s settled. One more thing, you’d better not use your real name now. If Di Yi knows that you’re in the talisman Amulet sect, I’m afraid there will be trouble! I can use a fake name for now!”</p><p>Bai Shijin suggested.</p><p>“Then, from now on, I’ll use the name ‘tianyun’!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>Tianyun. He had once used it in the blazing sun Empire, and not many people knew about it.</p><p>alright, that’s all for today. A few days later, I’ll send out a notice to inform the entire sect that you’ve become a candidate for the zongzi position. Goodbye!</p><p>After du songjue finished speaking, he stood up and left with large strides.</p><p>Meng Chong and the others also stood up and left.</p><p>In the end, the talisman sect’s elders also left one after another, leaving only Bai Shijin, Yan kuangtu, and Lu Ming in the hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the rest will be up to you. In a few days, the zongzi candidate token will be given to you. When the time comes, you can enter any of the sacred cultivation grounds of the talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>also, I’ve already informed my disciple. I’ll arrange a new place for you to live later!</p><p>Bai Shijin said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you, senior white!” Lu Ming was sincerely grateful. This time, Bai Shijin had helped him a lot.</p><p>At that moment, a Pearl flew out from Lu Ming’s glabella. It was the soul gathering Pearl of the nine suns Supreme. It flew to Yan kuangtu and he reached out to grab it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, cultivate in the talisman Amulet sect from now on. I’m going to bring master to find some treasures to help master condense his soul power!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“I hope senior Jiuyang can recover soon!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The three of them were still talking when a young woman walked in.</p><p>This woman was in her early 20s. She had an impressive figure and was very beautiful in a long red dress.</p><p>“Master, is there something you need me for?”</p><p>The young lady glanced at Lu Ming and Yan kuangtu curiously before bowing to Bai Shijin.</p><p>Chi Xue, you’re here. Let me introduce you to tianyun. This is his first time at the talisman Amulet sect and he will be cultivating there from now on. Please take care of him during this period of time. Also, tianyun will be moving into Cloud Peak House!</p><p>Bai Shijin said to the young woman.</p><p>“What? No, master, I won’t agree to let him stay in Cloud Peak House. I’ve always lived there alone.”</p><p>When the young woman heard this, she immediately cried out in dissatisfaction.</p><p>“What’s wrong? The cloud Peak Residence has the eyes of inscription, and it’s the easiest place to sense the laws of inscription. How can I let you monopolize such a good place? tianyun has to move there, and if you don’t agree, you can move!”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s face darkened.</p><p>&Nbsp; the young woman’s face paled and she stopped talking. Her eyes began to mist as she looked at Bai Shijin.</p><p>Master usually doted on her the most, but today he actually scolded her for an outsider, making her feel very wronged.</p><p>“Tianyun, this is my youngest disciple, Bai chixue. I’ve spoiled her, and she’s embarrassed me. In the future, you two will get along well!”</p><p>Bai Shijin smiled.</p><p>“Greetings, miss Bai!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Bai chixue.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Bai chixue snorted and ignored Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
