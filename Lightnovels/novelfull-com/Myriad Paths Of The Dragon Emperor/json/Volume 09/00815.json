They were demonic beasts at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>At this moment, the two elders also saw Lu Ming and his partner. Their eyes lit up and they rushed toward them at top speed, shouting, ” “Help! Help!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. These two old fellows were obviously trying to shift the blame to them. Lu Ming would not let them have their way.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered and retreated with Wang haoxian.</p><p>“Save us!”</p><p>The two elders chased after Lu Ming and the other man while the few powerful demonic beasts behind them continued to pursue them.</p><p>“You two, you can’t just leave me in the lurch!”</p><p>The two old men called out.</p><p>“What did you take from those demonic beasts? otherwise, why would they chase after you?”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly.</p><p>The two old men’s expressions changed, and one of them said, ” “We didn’t take anything. We just went deep in and encountered these demonic beasts. They were crazily chasing us. Our other companions were all killed by them, and we are the only two left!”</p><p>The two old men said as they flew towards them.</p><p>“Hand over your storage rings and I’ll save you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>These two old men must have taken something from those demonic beasts. Otherwise, why would those demonic beasts keep chasing them?</p><p>“You … You’re robbing me!”</p><p>The two old men said.</p><p>if you don’t give it to me, then get lost. If you continue to pester me, I’ll make a move!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the eyes of the two elders. They did not say a word and continued to pester Lu Ming and the rest as they flew toward them.</p><p>Since Lu Ming and the rest did not take action, he would implicate them.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A giant black Wolf roared and charged at them at the fastest speed.</p><p>This giant wolf had combat strength at the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm. With a swipe of its claw, it enveloped the elder, Lu Ming, and the others.</p><p>The two old men cried out in alarm and ran for their lives.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wang haoxian took a step forward and threw out a fiery fist radiance, which collided with the Wolf’s claw.</p><p>The giant wolf roared and a large part of its claw was burnt. However, Wang haoxian was also forced to retreat.</p><p>The giant Wolf’s eyes were blood red as it howled madly and pounced on the two old men without a care for its life.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll grant you your wish!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold. The infinite Dragon Spear appeared and swept out. The Spear’s radiance expanded and formed a huge Spear Pillar that swept toward the two elders.</p><p>“You … I can’t!”</p><p>The two elders were shocked and tried their best to block it. However, how could they block Lu Ming’s attack with their cultivation at the eighth level of the spiritual ocean tier? they were hit by the spear radiance and spat out mouthfuls of blood as their bodies flew towards the huge Wolf demonic beast.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant wolf demonic beast let out a long howl and slashed out its claw. Under the despairing eyes of the two elders, it tore them apart.</p><p>Then, the giant wolf opened its mouth and swallowed the two elders ‘storage rings. It glanced at the two of them and actually turned to leave.</p><p>“You want to leave? stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming would not let them leave. He strode forward and took a few steps.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With five steps, the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps exploded. The giant wolf demonic beast wailed as its huge body was stomped down, crashing into the ground below and creating a deep pit that was thousands of meters wide.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, the other two demonic beasts also pounced over. These two demonic beasts, a Giant Tiger and a giant snake, both had peak ninth level spiritual ocean tier combat strength.</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, two spearlights shot out. Two wounds were left on the bodies of the two demonic beasts, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The fresh blood made the two demonic beasts pounce on Lu Ming even more frantically. The giant wolf struggled to its feet and stomped on the ground. The earth rumbled and gravel flew everywhere. The giant wolf soared into the sky and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You don’t need to do anything, I’ll do it!”</p><p>On the side, Wang haoxian was about to make a move but was stopped by Lu Ming.</p><p>Coincidentally, there were a few opponents that Lu Ming could use as practice.</p><p>The long spear trembled and was swung out. The spear light swept across the void, constantly sweeping and stabbing at the three demonic beasts.</p><p>The three demonic beasts ‘roars were like thunder, shaking the heavens and earth. Three attacks-fire, ice, and lightning-burst out from their bodies and headed towards Lu Ming. The giant Tiger, giant wolf, and giant snake had claws as sharp as knives and bodies as hard as steel whips. They carried a terrifying attack power that could tear the body apart if hit.</p><p>Lu Ming used the three absolutes of the divine Dragon and the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps from time to time to battle three peak ninth level spiritual ocean tier demonic beasts. He even had the upper hand.</p><p>Wang haoxian was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had clearly not unleashed his full power yet. He had not used his bloodline martial arts technique, and he had also fused with a divine bloodline. Yet, he was able to suppress three peak ninth level spiritual ocean tier demonic beasts, while Lu Ming was only at the peak fifth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>If it were her, she would only be able to suppress one of the demonic beasts if she fused with a divine level bloodline. At most, she would be able to fight to a draw with three demonic beasts.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Just as Wang haoxian was lost in his thoughts, a shrill scream rang out in the sky. A silver light flashed and appeared in front of Wang haoxian in the next moment. Like the most terrifying heavenly blade, it slashed towards Wang haoxian’s head.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s pupils shrank sharply, and his body was covered in flames. He threw a punch, and a scorching fist radiance was thrown out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The silver light and the fist radiance collided. In an instant, the fist radiance dissipated, and the silver light came again.</p><p>Wang haoxian retreated quickly and threw two punches at the same time. The two fist auras were dispersed again, but they were blocked for a while. Wang haoxian had time to prepare. His divine bloodline appeared. Wang haoxian merged with the bloodline and turned into a purple Firebird, pouncing forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The purple Firebird and the silver light collided. With a loud boom, the purple Firebird flew back, and the silver light also stopped.</p><p>It was a giant Silver Bird with a wingspan of 50 meters. Its entire body was silver, as if it was cast from silver.</p><p>“Silver ROC!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s pupils shrank.</p><p>The silver ROC had the bloodline of the divine beast, the Golden-winged ROC. It was a descendant and was extremely powerful. Ordinary demonic beasts couldn’t compare to it.</p><p>Ordinary demonic beasts were like ordinary human martial artists, while demonic beasts that possessed the bloodline of divine beasts were like the prodigies of the human race. They had powerful combat strength and could fight across levels.</p><p>Moreover, the higher the concentration of the divine beast bloodline, the stronger the talent and power.</p><p>This silver ROC was also at the peak ninth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The silver ROC let out a shrill cry and pounced at Wang haoxian again. Wang haoxian had no choice but to flap his wings to face the attack.</p><p>However, the silver ROC was much more powerful than the other three demonic beasts combined. After a few clashes, Wang haoxian dispersed the flames and returned to his human form, spitting out blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The silver ROC turned into a flash of silver lightning. Its wings were like heavenly blades, and it slashed toward Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes were filled with despair. She had nowhere to run.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared in front of her and struck out a palm, sending the silver ROC flying.</p><p>Wang haoxian widened his eyes in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
