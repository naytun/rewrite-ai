His skin was covered with dense scales and his aura was extremely violent.</p><p>Wang haoxian looked in the other direction and realized that the three demonic beasts had all been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The silver ROC let out a loud cry and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch, which collided with the silver ROC’s wings.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The silver ROC’s huge body was sent flying and it wailed in pain. One of its wings was deformed and its bone armor had been broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>The silver ROC’s blood-red eyes actually revealed a look of fear. It flapped its wings and turned to leave.</p><p>“You still want to run?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and caught up to the silver ROC.</p><p>The violent force of the kick landed on the back of the silver ROC. The silver ROC wailed in pain and was sent flying to the ground. A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he thrust it out, piercing through the silver ROC’s heart and killing it.</p><p>Wang haoxian was shocked.</p><p>The silver ROC, a descendant of the Golden-winged giant Roc, was killed by Lu Ming with a crushing force. This silver ROC had almost killed her just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. In that case, it would not be too difficult for Lu Ming to kill her now.</p><p>Also, what kind of secret technique was that? it was so terrifying. His body was covered in scales like a demonic beast, and his aura was violent and terrifying.</p><p>She felt extremely complicated. In her eyes, Lu Ming was becoming more and more mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming flew down and secretly devoured the silver ROC’s blood essence.</p><p>“It’s indeed powerful to release a burst of dragon power!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Just now, he had used a burst of dragon power. After that, he used the prison suppressing heaven technique, which was so powerful that he killed three demonic beasts, blocked the silver ROC’s attack on Wang haoxian, and killed it.</p><p>I wonder how powerful it would be if two Dragon powers were to burst out at the same time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>When the nine Dragon bloodline was raised to the second level of the divine level, there would be two Dragon powers.</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You don’t want these demonic beast corpses?” Wang haoxian asked.</p><p>There were a total of four ninth level spiritual ocean tier demonic beast corpses, especially the silver ROC. The materials from its body were extremely valuable.</p><p>“If you want it, you can take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands.</p><p>With the wealth left behind by the nine suns Supreme Master, he didn’t care about these demonic beasts at all. The spirit stones he exchanged for them wouldn’t even be enough for him to swallow in a few bites.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped forward. Wang haoxian looked at Lu Ming a few more times. After making sure that Lu Ming really did not want the bodies, she put the four corpses away.</p><p>On a mountain peak tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, refining his blood essence.</p><p>Wang haoxian stood by Lu Ming’s side, protecting him.</p><p>The blood essence of the four demonic beasts at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean tier was extremely dense. However, with the refining power of the nine Dragon bloodline, it didn’t take long for it to be completely refined.</p><p>All the power of the blood essence flowed into the prison-suppressing stele bloodline, but the bloodline did not improve. It was still at level two of the divine level.</p><p>“What did those guys steal from those demonic beasts? And those demonic beasts were a little different from the other demonic beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>The demonic beasts in the wild beast forest were all affected by the killing intent here. They were all extremely violent and fearless. They had lost their intelligence and would not show any signs of fear.</p><p>However, those demonic beasts showed fear after being injured by Lu Ming. The silver ROC’s fear was even more intense. It even turned around and ran away. It was very different from the other demonic beasts, which made Lu Ming feel a little strange.</p><p>Could it be because of the high level?</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He decided not to bother about it for now. He wanted to see what the two elders had taken from the demonic beasts that caused the demonic beasts to chase after them.</p><p>Lu Ming rummaged through the two storage rings.</p><p>They were all spiritual crystals, a few rough stones, pills, and secret manuals. Lu Ming did not think much of them.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming found a metal box. The box was not big but it was placed in a very important place. Lu Ming took it out and opened it to find a red stone inside.</p><p>The stone was the size of a fist. Once the metal box was opened, a wondrous aura emanated from the stone. Lu Ming immediately felt his mind clear and he was in high spirits.</p><p>“This … Could it be the soul gathering stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly bloomed with a bright light.</p><p>The soul gathering stone was a rare treasure that had a magical effect on the soul.</p><p>Legend had it that when a person had just died and their soul had yet to disperse, if a soul gathering stone was used to gather it, there would be a miraculous way to bring them back to life.</p><p>Of course, there were some exaggerations in the legends, but it was definitely useful to the soul.</p><p>“Those guys must have taken this soul gathering stone from the demonic beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Those demonic beasts must have regained some of their intelligence because of the soul gathering stone. That was why they knew fear. That was why they had been chasing after the two old men to get the soul gathering stone back.</p><p>“This soul congregation stone will definitely be of great use to senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>If the soul of the nine suns Supreme was strengthened to a certain extent, he might really be able to be resurrected in the future and reappear in the world.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the cave!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and flew back to the cave abode with Wang haoxian.</p><p>A few thousand miles away from the cave.</p><p>I have at most a month before I leave the wild beast forest. During this time, you don’t have to hunt demonic beasts. Cultivate on your own. I will send you a voice transmission when I am about to leave!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed Wang haoxian and flew to the cave abode alone. Soon, he returned to the cave abode.</p><p>The nine suns cosmos was still sitting cross-legged, but the soul-consolidating tree had completely shriveled up. There was no energy left. Lu Ming guessed that the nine suns cosmos would wake up soon.</p><p>As expected, three days later, the nine suns Supreme woke up.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, how’s your recovery?”</p><p>Ninesuns stepped forward to pay her respects and asked.</p><p>my soul power has increased a lot. Finally, I won’t fall into a deep sleep so easily!</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns smiled.</p><p>that’s good. Senior Jiuyang, I’ve obtained a soul gathering stone. It might be useful to you!</p><p>Lu Ming took out the soul gathering stone and held it in his palm.</p><p>The eyes of the nine suns Supreme Master lit up instantly like two small Suns.</p><p>He stretched out his hand and grabbed the soul gathering stone in his hand. He examined it for a moment and then laughed, it really is the soul gathering stone. Haha, good, good. With this soul gathering stone, my soul power will be greatly restored. Then, I can help you!</p><p>“It’s good that it’s useful to you, senior!” Lu Ming was very happy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you. I’ll go back to the Supreme shrine to refine it now!”</p><p>With that, the nine suns Supreme wrapped himself in the soul gathering stone and turned into a ray of light, rushing into Lu Ming’s glabella and disappearing.</p><p>“I’ll cultivate for a while more, then I’ll go to the sea Cloud sect and meet up with little Qing and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
