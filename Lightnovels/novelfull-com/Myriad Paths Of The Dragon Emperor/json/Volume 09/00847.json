Not only did he have a high status, but he was also extremely talented.</p><p>In just a short hundred years, Yan kuangtu had cultivated to the supremacy stage, and was not inferior to his master, the nine yang supremacy.</p><p>Moreover, Yan kuangtu was arrogant, unruly, and lawless. He showed no respect to anyone, not even to Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>He had once almost destroyed a powerful force that was second only to the ancient family in a fit of anger, which shocked ninedragons.</p><p>It was normal for such an existence to dare to berate the Supreme martial artists of the ancient families.</p><p>But what did he want to do by appearing here?</p><p>The heads of the two families frowned.</p><p>“Yan kuangtu, what are you doing? Move aside!”</p><p>The head of the Luan family said coldly, a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p>“What do you want? “You’ve all lived for thousands of years, yet you’re joining forces against a junior. How shameless! Let me tell you, Lu Ming is my little brother. If you want to touch him, you’ll have to defeat me first!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a few sips of wine, his eyes wild.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Yan kuangtu had addressed Lu Ming as ‘little brother’. So, they knew each other. Yan kuangtu actually knew Lu Ming?</p><p>“Big brother Yan!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s appearance surprised Lu Ming, and he could not help but call out.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, not bad. You can fight against a Supreme-being at the spiritual ocean tier. Impressive, impressive. You’re much more impressive than me!</p><p>Yan kuangtu burst into laughter.</p><p>“Yan kuangtu, are you not going to move out of the way today?”</p><p>The eyes of the master of the chaotic family were cold.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Yan Kuang tu’s reply was very simple.</p><p>alright, Yan kuangtu. I’ll see how strong you are, the strongest genius after Jiuyang!</p><p>The master of the chaotic family’s voice was cold, and a violent fighting will burst out. He took a step forward and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was extremely terrifying, and the void shattered.</p><p>Yan kuangtu opened his mouth and sucked out a mouthful of wine from his wine gourd. At the same time, he threw out a punch.</p><p>This punch wasn’t as earth-shattering as the one from the head of the chaotic family. It seemed very ordinary.</p><p>However, the result of this clash of fists left everyone dumbstruck.</p><p>The two fists met, and a terrifying explosion rang out in the air. A figure staggered backwards. This figure was actually the clan head of the Luan clan.</p><p>The clan leader of the Luan clan was forced to retreat by a single punch from Yan kuangtu.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>They were both Supreme martial artists, but how could Yan kuangtu be so strong?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the master of the Luan family roared. His battle intent soared. A saber appeared in his hand, and he charged at Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A shocking sword light burst out from Yan kuangtu’s hand. The sword light and the saber Light collided. The saber Light was shattered, but the sword light continued to slash down.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The head of the chaotic family shouted in disbelief.</p><p>He had to continuously slash out with his saber to block Yan kuangtu’s sword radiance.</p><p>“Like master, like disciple. Jiuyang has taken in a good disciple. Yan kuangtu, you may be strong in combat, but you can’t protect Lu Ming!”</p><p>The master of the Kong family stepped forward and stood next to the master of the Luan family.</p><p>“Why can’t I?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>that’s because His Majesty, the Martial Emperor, has specifically requested for Lu Ming. We’re just following orders to bring Lu Ming to His Majesty!</p><p>The master of the chaotic clan said.</p><p>“What does His Majesty want Lu Ming for?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said with a frown.</p><p>this, we don’t know. So, it’s better for you to move away. Otherwise, if you make His Majesty unhappy, none of us can bear the responsibility!</p><p>The head of the Luan family sneered.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s brows furrowed even more. He turned to Lu Ming and said,”Brother Lu Ming, do you know why his Majesty the Martial Emperor is looking for you? Could it be because of the divine cauldron?”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and fought the Masters of the Jiang and Wang families. The battle was intense.</p><p>He muttered to himself for a moment before saying, ” Di Yi, you came to me because you wanted my bloodline and wanted to take it for your own use!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was calm, but it was like a storm, stirring up thousands of waves.</p><p>“What? What did Lu Ming say? How dare you call His Majesty force Emperor in this way and slander His Majesty force Emperor!”</p><p>“Evil creature, what an evil creature! Such audacity, who does he think he is? He dares to say that His Majesty force Emperor wants his bloodline, but it’s just a second class divine bloodline. How could His Majesty force Emperor take a fancy to it?”</p><p>slander! Nonsense! This person should be cut into pieces as a warning to the others!</p><p>Countless people roared and looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“Evil creature, how dare you slander His Majesty! You’re courting death!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan roared as he fought with all his might.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, you’ve seen this kid’s heart. He’s simply lawless. We can’t keep him here. Why aren’t you moving? ”</p><p>The Luan family said.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Unless the Grandmaster comes and explains everything, I, Yan kuangtu, will not let you take Lu Ming away!” Yan kuangtu did not move.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s words stunned many people.</p><p>Arrogant, he was really arrogant. He actually wanted Martial Emperor Di Yi to explain it in person. He was too arrogant.</p><p>The crowd finally understood why Yan kuangtu and Lu Ming would address each other as brothers. The two of them were the same kind of people. They were equally lawless, arrogant, and unruly.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, How dare you! Since that’s the case, we’ll have to take you down first. Everyone, if we don’t join forces now, when will we? ”</p><p>The master of the Jiang family looked at the last two people.</p><p>“That’s the only way!”</p><p>The master of the Dongfang family sighed and stepped forward. “Brother Nangong, you go and help Brother Jiang. Brother Wang, take down Lu Ming. Leave Yan kuangtu to us!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The head of the Nangong family stepped forward and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Meanwhile, master Dongfang, master Luan, and Master Kong’s auras erupted and enveloped Yan kuangtu.</p><p>The Supreme martial artists of the six great ancient families were about to join forces.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Yan kuangtu shouted coldly as his sword Qi exploded. At this moment, his sword Qi was filled with blazing flames. The temperature of the flames seemed to be even higher than that of the patriarch of the Wang family.</p><p>At the same time, the Supremes of the Luan clan, Dongfang clan, Kong clan, and the other three clans also made their moves. Violent energy burst out and blasted toward Yan kuangtu, trying to restrain him.</p><p>“Three old fogeys, what can you do to me?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu let out a long cry as golden flames suddenly burst out of his body. The terrifying temperature spread out for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The Golden flame burst out with the sword Qi.</p><p>“Golden crow’s fire!”</p><p>The three Supreme martial artists of the Luan family looked grave as their three attacks collided with Yan kuangtu’s sword Qi.</p><p>After the explosion, Yan kuangtu did not retreat a single step.</p><p>This was extremely shocking. Yan kuangtu was actually able to fight against three Supreme martial artists without even retreating a single step. This was unbelievable.</p><p>They were both Supreme martial artists, but why was Yan kuangtu so powerful?</p><p>One must know that those who could reach the Supreme-being realm were all rare geniuses, and they were all invincible existences among their peers. Otherwise, how could they have reached the Supreme-being realm?</p><p>But now, Yan kuangtu’s combat strength was even stronger and more terrifying.</p><p>On the other side, the head of the Nangong family burst out and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, the sky trembled and another cauldron descended, crashing toward the head of the Nangong family.</p><p>The sixth divine cauldron.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
