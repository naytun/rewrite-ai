Two cauldrons were enough to block two Supreme-beings.</p><p>...</p><p>The other six continued to suppress the Wang clan master.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The six divine cauldrons smashed against the giant purple sword like they were forging iron.</p><p>The giant purple sword trembled violently, and the flames became weaker and weaker. After the six divine cauldrons took turns to smash the sword, the giant purple sword shrank rapidly and returned to the appearance of the Wang family master.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Wang family was in a terrible state. Their body fortifications were in tatters, and there were many wounds on their bodies. Blood was flowing out from their mouths.</p><p>Tragic, it was too tragic. A Supreme martial artist of a generation had been beaten to such a state. This made countless people rub their eyes, thinking that they were seeing things.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family was about to go crazy. He roared repeatedly, unable to accept all this.</p><p>He was the head of an ancient family, a Supreme figure who had dominated the eastern barren territory. However, he had been beaten up by a young man in his twenties.</p><p>No matter what method this junior used, he had lost a lot of face and would become a laughingstock. If this were to spread to other forces, they would definitely treat it as a joke.</p><p>At the thought of that, he was filled with hatred and could not wait to skin Lu Ming alive.</p><p>“What are you screaming for? It seems that the repair is not enough, then let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and continued to suppress it.</p><p>The master of the Wang family was shocked and quickly retreated. Unfortunately, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had already locked on to him. It directly pierced through the void and blasted toward him.</p><p>The master of the Wang clan could only do his best to resist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The first divine cauldron had caused the patriarch of the Wang family to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Following that, the second divine cauldron caused the head of the Wang family’s hair to be disheveled and one of his arms to be shattered.</p><p>However, a Supreme-being’s vitality was extremely terrifying. Even if his arm was severed, it would quickly regrow and heal. However, the third divine cauldron continued to smash down.</p><p>“Ah, everyone, save me!”</p><p>The master of the Wang clan was finally afraid, and he began to ask the other Supreme martial artists for help.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist of his generation was actually beaten to the point where he could only cry for help. This was also rare.</p><p>The other five Supreme martial artists all wanted to help.</p><p>Unfortunately, how could his wish be fulfilled?</p><p>“Haha, brother Lu Ming, good job!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed. The three-legged golden Crow flew around and blocked the three Supreme martial artists.</p><p>As for the other two Supreme martial artists, they were blocked by the two Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons and could not break through the obstruction at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The third divine cauldron smashed half of the Wang clan’s patriarch’s body, and the fourth divine cauldron continued to press down.</p><p>From all directions, countless people looked at this scene in shock, including the spiritual God Realm powerhouses.</p><p>Ruthless, too ruthless, and too unbelievable.</p><p>Was Lu Ming really planning to kill a Supreme martial artist? Was the patriarch of the Wang clan really going to fall here today?</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Someone from the Wang family shouted in fear.</p><p>“Haha, good!”</p><p>In the crowd, fatty laughed loudly, drawing the angry gazes of the crowd.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s body trembled. This scene had an even greater impact on her.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family was the strongest combat force in the Wang family. Her patriarch was a Supreme existence in the Wang family. However, such an existence could not even keep his life in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>In the sea billow ancient garden, Xie Zhen stared at this scene in a daze. His eyes almost exploded.</p><p>He had never dreamed that Lu Ming would actually summon the nine divine cauldrons in a fit of anger for the sake of a beauty and attempt to kill a Supreme martial artist. It was too shocking and terrifying.</p><p>The cauldron was about to fall, and the patriarch of the Wang family couldn’t resist it in his current state. He might die on the spot.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the sky. This voice sounded like it came from the heavens and was filled with endless majesty. However, when they heard this voice, countless people’s hearts trembled. It was as if they were facing the heavens and the universe, and they wanted to kneel.</p><p>Then, countless people saw thousands of miles long cracks appear in the sky. A huge arm stretched out from the crack. It was as big as a mountain, like the palm of the heavens. Above it, intent realm curled up, and a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>At this moment, countless people started to tremble.</p><p>Even the paragons were shaken.</p><p>The huge palm pressed down on Lu Ming, and an endless pressure enveloped him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body almost exploded. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron floating above his head shook violently.</p><p>“Nine Cauldrons, protect me!”</p><p>In the face of such a mighty force, he couldn’t care less about killing the Wang family master. He controlled the nine Cauldrons to float around him.</p><p>imperial power! This is the aura of an imperial power Expert! Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>Such a sentence appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming had once felt the aura of an Emperor from Lian Cang. Although Lian Cang was only a wisp of his soul, his aura was still like the might of the heavens, high and mighty, dominating the world.</p><p>This palm was very similar to Lian Cang’s, but it was many times larger.</p><p>In ninedragons, Martial Emperor Di Yi was the only sovereign realm expert.</p><p>“Grandmaster!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Your Majesty force Emperor!”</p><p>The six Supreme-beings and many spiritual God Realm experts were greatly shocked.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had actually taken action personally.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen? Old man, come quickly!”</p><p>The fat man shouted.</p><p>However, the people around him didn’t pay any attention to him. Their eyes were all fixed on the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the giant palm pressed down, the space crumbled and the intent realm curled up like the hand of God.</p><p>A terrifying pressure passed through the void and pressed down on Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body trembled continuously as if it was about to collapse at any moment.</p><p>The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were suspended in the air, but they were shaking non-stop. Lu Ming felt that he could not control them. The pressure he was facing was too strong.</p><p>“So what if you’re a Martial Emperor? Break!”</p><p>A crazed look appeared in Lu Ming’s eyes. He raised his head and roared. The nine Dragon bloodlines roared. The only remaining golden chakra exploded with a loud bang, turned into a golden light, and entered the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out a large mouthful of blood. He was in so much pain that he felt like his body was about to split apart, but his eyes were still fixed on the ceiling.</p><p>Clang clang …</p><p>The nine divine cauldrons trembled and their auras surged. Under everyone’s shocked eyes, the nine divine cauldrons actually merged into one, erupting with a terrifying power that shot into the sky and rushed toward the Imperial Palm.</p><p>The next moment, the cauldron and the palm collided.</p><p>But strangely, there was no movement or energy. The cauldron and the palm were motionless in the air, as if they were in a stalemate.</p><p>“The heavens …”</p><p>This was the only word in countless people’s hearts. Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and actually blocked a blow from Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>This scene was unbelievable.</p><p>Countless people felt their hearts in their throats and were about to stop beating.</p><p>Yan kuangtu and the other Supreme martial artists had stopped fighting. At this moment, they raised their heads and looked at the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
