Lu Ming used the six Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons to fight against the three Supreme martial artists.</p><p>...</p><p>Yan kuangtu had blocked three great masters by himself.</p><p>The six ancient families and the six Supreme martial artists were all blocked. This scene had left countless people in the sky dumbfounded. Everything that had happened today was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The master of the Jiang family was like a divine weapon. He knocked away two divine cauldrons in a row and performed the bloodline fusion.</p><p>After that, the head of the Nangong family and the head of the Wang family, the Supreme martial artists of the three ancient families, all used their bloodline fusion to take Lu Ming down in one go.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The entire sky was pierced through. The three great Supremes had joined forces and unleashed their most powerful attack. It was too terrifying. Few people below the Martial Emperor realm could withstand it.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron kept shaking, and the connection between them seemed to be on the verge of being broken. The pressure Lu Ming felt was getting stronger and stronger. His bones cracked and fine beads of blood seeped out of his skin.</p><p>“He can’t hold on much longer!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family transformed into a huge purple flame sword. The flames were blazing and his Heavenly Fire burst out, spreading towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared again and again, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook. However, it was still difficult to withstand the attacks of the three Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The master of the Jiang family broke through the attack of one of the divine cauldrons and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The first divine cauldron above Lu Ming’s head trembled and emitted a brilliant light that blasted toward the Jiang family’s master.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A violent boom was heard. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. Together with the first divine cauldron, he was sent flying and blood spurted from his mouth.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was shocked. He wanted to rush out to save Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yan kuangtu, do you really think the three of us are just for show? Kill!”</p><p>die! the master of the Luan family roared. He used the fusion of his bloodlines and turned into an invincible God of War, charging toward Yan kuangtu.</p><p>At the same time, the head of the Kong family and the head of the Dongfang family also used their bloodline fusion. The bloodlines of the three great family heads were all at the sixth level of the divine level. The three of them joined forces and unleashed a powerful attack.</p><p>No matter how strong Yan kuangtu was, he didn’t dare to be careless in the face of three great Supremes.</p><p>He let out a long cry, and a huge golden divine bird appeared.</p><p>This divine bird was shaped like a Crow, and its entire body was golden in color. It was suffused with golden flames, and the temperature of these golden flames was even more terrifying than the Wang family’s purple Heavenly Fire.</p><p>This divine bird had three legs and eight dazzling golden chakras.</p><p>Divine level rank 8 bloodline, three-legged golden Crow.</p><p>According to the legends, the sun was formed by the three-legged golden Crow. It was an extremely terrifying divine beast.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s bloodline was the three-legged golden Crow, and it was a level eight divine level expert. He was two levels higher than the family head of the ancient family clan. It was simply terrifying. No wonder his combat power was so strong.</p><p>Yan kuangtu used his bloodline fusion and turned into a three-legged golden Crow. He fought with the Three Sovereigns, and the sky and earth shook. Endless power formed a terrifying wind that spread in all directions.</p><p>Fortunately, more spiritual God Realm experts had appeared and spread out to resist the spreading force. Otherwise, with so many Supreme martial artists attacking, everything within a radius of several million li would have been blown up.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist was too powerful. He could destroy a country with a flip of his hand. An Empire like the blazing sun Empire could be destroyed by a Supreme martial artist with a single palm. He was unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Yan kuangtu was fighting against three great Supremes. It was difficult to determine the victor at the moment, so he could not withdraw to save Lu Ming.</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was completely suppressed and the situation was precarious.</p><p>“Six divine cauldrons is his limit. He can’t summon any more!”</p><p>The voice of the Wang clan leader rang out, and his attacks became even more terrifying.</p><p>This incident had completely exceeded their expectations. They had never expected that Lu Ming would be able to lift the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and summon six of them. This was unprecedented in history.</p><p>In the end, even they had no choice but to join forces to deal with Lu Ming. No matter what the outcome was today, it would be a terrible blow to the reputation of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>As the master of the Wang family who was the first to attack, he hated Lu Ming even more.</p><p>little bastard, don’t put up any pointless resistance. Since His Majesty has spoken, your fate has already been decided!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan continued to speak, his killing intent cold.</p><p>don’t make it sound so Grand. Even if the sky wants to suppress me, I will break it, not to mention Di Yi. Nine-Dragon Cauldron, fight with me!</p><p>Lu Ming roared like a dragon. The body of the nine Dragons twisted and blood mist filled the air.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, one of the Golden chakras on the body of the nine Dragon bloodline exploded with a bang.</p><p>The chakra exploded, and the bloodline of the nine Dragons roared as if it was in extreme pain.</p><p>Lu Ming growled as well. His eyes were bloodshot. He felt as if his soul was about to split apart. It was too painful.</p><p>But his gaze was still determined and determined.</p><p>The chakra exploded and turned into a wisp of golden radiance, which seeped into the divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook, and the Dragon-shaped carvings on the cauldron shone brightly. The six Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky trembled, and the void collapsed. Another behemoth flew over and pressed down on the Wang clan leader.</p><p>The seventh Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons exploded a chakra and summoned the seventh Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>However, this was not the end.</p><p>“The cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming howled, his voice shaking the heavens.</p><p>The sky trembled, and then another divine cauldron descended.</p><p>The eighth statue.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky shook again as the patriarch of the Wang family shouted. Another Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron descended.</p><p>The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons had all descended.</p><p>When the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons gathered, they seemed to have produced a strong resonance. All of them were shining brightly and the roars of Dragons shook the sky.</p><p>The nine Cauldrons were centered around the one above Lu Ming’s head. The other cauldrons surrounded him, and an unbelievably powerful aura spread out.</p><p>“The nine Cauldrons gather, suppress the heavens!”</p><p>A voice seemed to come out of the divine cauldron.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the eight cauldrons around him pressed down.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With three loud bangs, the master of the Wang family and the other two Supreme martial artists were sent flying.</p><p>“Impossible?”</p><p>The master of the Wang family shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“I’ll kill you today! I’ll slaughter the Supreme martial artist!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice rang out. With a wave of his hand, at least six of the eight divine cauldrons flew towards the Wang family. The other two defended the other two Supreme-beings.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The six divine cauldrons continued to attack the Wang family. The purple sword that the patriarch had transformed into exploded with a shocking sword Qi as he used all his strength to block the attack.</p><p>However, every time he blocked, he would be sent flying and the sword would shake continuously.</p><p>After the sixth time, the flames on the purple sword’s body were much weaker, as if it had been severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand again and the six cauldrons continued to press down.</p><p>“Evil creature! Don’t you dare!”</p><p>The Jiang family’s master shouted in anger and joined forces with the Nangong family’s master to attack Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming controlled the two cauldrons and blocked their attacks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
