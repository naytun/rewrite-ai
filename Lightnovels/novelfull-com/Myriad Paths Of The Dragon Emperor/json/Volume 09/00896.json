They were dumbfounded.</p><p>...</p><p>our divine wilderness continent is actually just a drop in the ocean. Beyond the ocean, there are many other continents similar to the divine wilderness continent, and some are even hundreds or thousands of times bigger than the divine wilderness continent? ”</p><p>A young man exclaimed, his eyes wide open.</p><p>Huanzhen and the others were the same.</p><p>They were too shocked.</p><p>In the past, they had thought that the divine wilderness mainland was the center of the world. Although they knew that the endless sea was mysterious and that there might be other continents, they would at most think that it was shocking to have two or three similar continents.</p><p>However, du songjue used the word ‘many’, and there was also a land that was hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the divine wilderness continent. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was already extremely vast. The eastern wilderness had hundreds of regions and was extremely vast.</p><p>As for Southern nether, Northern Plains, and Western Desert, they were also vast, not smaller than the eastern barren territory.</p><p>As for the central continent, it was said to be even more vast, with many outstanding people and experts.</p><p>In such a vast land, there were actually so many overseas?</p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who was slightly better.</p><p>Qiu Yue might have been taken away by the people from overseas.</p><p>He had once entered a small island in the heaven realm by chance and broadened his horizons. He also knew that this world was beyond his expectations and was vast and boundless.</p><p>that’s right. Unless it’s an Imperial cultivator, it’s difficult to leave the divine wilderness continent and head overseas. That’s why we’re not sure. Master Lian Cang had mentioned it before. Furthermore, the battle of Providence doesn’t only involve the divine wilderness continent. According to master, the entire primordial realm and other continents will have battles of Providence, where the elites compete for supremacy!</p><p>Du songjue said again.</p><p>This time, even Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>It was not just the divine wilderness continent, even the other continents overseas would have a battle for Providence.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>What was the reason for this? how could they do it at the same time in such a vast area?</p><p>Or rather, was there any connection between the wars of Providence?</p><p>Was it the natural operation of the laws of the heavenly Dao, or was it man-made?</p><p>If it was man-made, who could have such terrifying energy to control the vast primordial realm at the same time?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mind was filled with many thoughts.</p><p>“Master once said that if you stand out in the battle of Providence and achieve certain results, you’ll be able to reap unexpected rewards!”</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>“Some sort of standard? What’s the standard?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were surprised.</p><p>“This, I don’t know. Master didn’t tell me in detail, but it seems that it’s extremely difficult to reach that standard. In short, you just have to do your best. Make your preparations!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Huan Zhen, and the rest nodded and left the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming left the hall and flew to the treasure Pavilion. He bought some items and returned to the cloud Peak House.</p><p>“Big brother Yan!”</p><p>Near Yun Peak House, Lu Ming was overjoyed to see Yan kuangtu.</p><p>It had been half a year since they last met, and Yan kuangtu had finally appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan Kuang tu laughed.</p><p>At this moment, Yan kuangtu’s body flashed, and the figure of the nine suns Supreme Master appeared.</p><p>Now, the remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme Master had become much more solid, and his soul power was much stronger than before. It was obvious that he had recovered a lot during this period of time.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted, feeling happy for the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how are the preparations for the battle of Providence?”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master said with a smile.</p><p>“It’s alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>well, with your current cultivation and combat power, it’s still very difficult for you to stand out, ” Hong Ling said. however, the battle of Providence will start in one stage. There’s a year’s time, and it’s enough for you to rise up. You have to make good use of this one year so that you can suppress everyone in the final battle of the ancient city of Providence!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>Supremacy Jiuyang and Yan kuangtu, for example, had both participated in the war of karmic luck and obtained great opportunities.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded seriously. He knew that with his current combat strength and cultivation, it was more than enough to deal with ordinary heaven’s favorites. However, there was still a gap between him and the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Lu Ming, we’re just here to see you. We won’t be sending you off in the battle of Providence. Master’s recovery has reached a critical point. We’ll have to set off again and leave the Yin Yang mountain soon!</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“No need to send me off, senior Jiuyang’s recovery is more important!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly nodded.</p><p>Then, the three of them chatted for a while. Supreme Master Jiuyang and Yan kuangtu mainly talked about their experiences in the battle of Providence in the past, hoping that it would be of help to Lu Ming.</p><p>They chatted for two hours before Yan kuangtu and the nine suns Supreme left. Lu Ming returned to the cloud Peak Residence.</p><p>Time flew by, and a few days passed in the blink of an eye. The time for the battle of karmic luck had finally arrived.</p><p>In the back mountain of Mount Liangyi, there was a huge piece of land. On the land, there was a huge round stone, which was full of mysterious carvings.</p><p>This stone had a heavy and ancient sense of vicissitude.</p><p>In the past, this place was a forbidden area of the talisman sect. Other than a few elders, no ordinary person was allowed to enter. Now, thousands of people had gathered here.</p><p>It was only when he arrived that Lu Ming realized that this was the place where he would participate in the battle of Providence.</p><p>The entrance to the battle of karmic luck was located in a very wondrous place. One couldn’t enter from other places, and had to go through a special passage.</p><p>The talisman sect, the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the heavenly demon Valley all had this special passageway.</p><p>Usually, this passageway was completely useless and had no effect. It would only activate automatically when the war of Providence started.</p><p>Which faction’s passageway one entered from represented which faction one was fighting for. In the future, one’s battle achievements would be counted on that faction’s head, and luck would descend.</p><p>This time, the talisman sect had sent over a thousand people to participate in the battle.</p><p>In addition to the true chosen, there were also many experts with profound cultivation bases selected from the younger generation. These young experts would be able to assist the chosen.</p><p>Furthermore, who knew who would be so lucky as to obtain a great opportunity and gather great fortune? No one could say for sure, so it would be more or less beneficial for more people to go in.</p><p>Lu Ming, fatty, ruan Tingting and Bai chixue stood together.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and a few other elders stood in front, staring at the huge round stone.</p><p>According to the legends, when a power became a transcendent power and had an Emperor, the ancient city of Providence would send this stone over to that power. This meant that the power had the right to send a single person to participate in the battle.</p><p>When a force was completely weakened, the stone would fly away on its own. This also meant that the force had completely declined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the round stone trembled, and the carvings on it began to flash with light. A mysterious aura began to flow.</p><p>Then, the light grew brighter and brighter, forming a huge vortex. This was the spatial tunnel, the entrance to the battle of Kismet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
