Do you want to take revenge on me? Hehe, how naïve. Since you’re in ninedragons, I’ll definitely find you.”</p><p>...</p><p>“Let’s leave this matter to the ancient families!”</p><p>The middle-aged man muttered. Then, his lips moved as if he was speaking.</p><p>Not long after, six middle-aged men entered the place.</p><p>Each of these six middle-aged men had an overbearing aura. It was obvious that they were in high positions and had the aura of an Overlord. However, these six middle-aged men were very respectful in front of the Man in Black.</p><p>“Your Majesty force Emperor!”</p><p>The six middle-aged men bowed in greeting.</p><p>Obviously, the black-robed middle-aged man was the ruler of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and one of the overlords of the eastern barren land, Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>The other six middle-aged men were the family heads of the six ancient families.</p><p>“Your Majesty force Emperor, may I know why you’ve called the six of us here?”</p><p>The head of the Dongfang family bowed and asked.</p><p>during this period of time, pay close attention to the geniuses of ninedragons, especially those who have awakened the true dragon bloodline. If there are any, bring them here!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The heads of the six families bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>After Martial Emperor Di Yi gave the order, he closed his eyes again.</p><p>The family heads of the six ancient families bowed and left.</p><p>……</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared, and its aura was shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and entered the nine Dragon bloodlines, fusing with them.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a true dragon with the power to destroy the world.</p><p>After a while, the nine Dragons ‘bloodline slowly shrank and turned into Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>“I wonder if there are any other functions after the nine Dragons bloodline is upgraded to a divine bloodline? The devouring power should be even stronger, right? Let’s find an opportunity to give it a try!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought excitedly and sensed carefully.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt a strange power in his spine and the blood of the nine Dragons. This power gave off a terrifying feeling, and Lu Ming seemed to be able to draw this power out at any time.</p><p>“What kind of power is this? Let’s go out and try!”</p><p>Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and appeared on a mountain peak thousands of miles away.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming drew out the power in the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>This power was similar to true essence, but it was completely different.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that this energy was much stronger than the essential core.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Once the energy was drawn out, it let out a shocking Dragon’s Roar. Following that, the energy fused into Lu Ming’s body. At that moment, Lu Ming’s muscles swelled up and scales appeared on his skin.</p><p>Dragon scales, these are dragon scales.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that his body was filled with endless power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. Wherever his fist passed, the air turned into liquid and then evaporated. The space was folded in front of Lu Ming’s fist like a piece of paper. A terrifying fist force burst out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed, seven huge mountains were penetrated and exploded. Many demonic beasts roared crazily and flew far away.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. The power of one punch was so terrifying!</p><p>This was just a casual punch from Lu Ming.</p><p>“What is this power? He’s too strong!”</p><p>While Lu Ming was shocked, he was also excited.</p><p>dragon power, the power of a true dragon! Kid, this is the power of a true dragon!</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan shouted.</p><p>“Dragon power?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>dragon power is a power that can only be mastered by a true dragon. It’s extremely powerful and is many times more advanced than true essence. It’s a top-tier power. Kid, you can actually Master Dragon power? ”</p><p>Dandan exclaimed.</p><p>I didn’t master it. It’s just a power born from my bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As he spoke, Lu Ming could feel the Dragon energy in his body weakening slowly. Very soon, the Dragon energy seemed to have been exhausted, and the Dragon scales on Lu Ming’s skin had disappeared.</p><p>“Why is there no more?” Lu Ming was shocked. It could not have been used up just like that, right?</p><p>“Kid, don’t worry. It will recover later. Even if it’s just a little bit, you’ll still be rich. The power of dragon power is not something Zhen Yuan can compare with. You’ve seen it just now,”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Could this be the benefit of advancing to the divine level with the nine Dragon bloodline?</p><p>He had actually condensed a surge of dragon power in his blood. After Lu Ming’s outburst, his combat strength would increase greatly.</p><p>This could be Lu Ming’s trump card.</p><p>I remember now. Kid, the bloodline you awakened isn’t the bloodline of the nine Dragons, is it? ”</p><p>Dandan suddenly shouted, her eyes fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yes, why?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, it’s really the bloodline of the nine Dragons. How did you awaken it? Did you use the blood essence of the nine Dragons?” Dandan asked again.</p><p>“Didn’t you already know that?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Dandan was by his side every day. She had long known his secret.</p><p>in the past, I only thought that it looked familiar. Now, I finally remember. Jiulong, it’s that kid Jiulong. It seems that he has already died in battle!</p><p>Dandan suddenly sighed.</p><p>“That kid Jiulong?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless. However, he was already used to dandan’s bragging tone. He asked curiously, ” “Dandan, do you know Jiulong?”</p><p>nonsense, of course I know him. I’m the head of the top ten Battle Beasts, and that kid nine Dragon is also one of the top ten Battle Beasts. It was me who guided him back then that his devouring talent could be displayed to its greatest extent. Didn’t you also master it? ”</p><p>Dandan put her hands behind her back and said in a mature tone.</p><p>“The nine Dragons are also one of the top ten war beasts? What are the top ten warbeasts?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious. He had been hearing dandan talk about the top ten beasts every day and he had long wanted to know.</p><p>“Kid, the top ten Battle Beasts are existences that have surpassed the divine beasts. Each of them is unique and incomparably powerful. With your current cultivation, it’s useless for you to know about them. I’ll tell you later!”</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>“Forget it if you don’t want to tell me. I’ll ask around myself in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, he returned to his cave and continued cultivating.</p><p>After the nine Dragons ‘bloodline advanced to the divine level, its devouring power had increased dozens of times, and refining blood essence was extremely fast.</p><p>Under the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s cultivation progressed at a tremendous pace.</p><p>As for nine suns Supreme, he was still under the soul consolidation tree and had not woken up.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>One month, two months, three months …</p><p>Soon, five months had passed since Lu Ming arrived at the wild beast forest.</p><p>In the past five months, Lu Ming had been improving rapidly in all aspects.</p><p>First, he lit up two more lamps on the inscription Dao. Just a few days ago, Lu Ming had lit up four blue Spirit lamps.</p><p>As for the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated to the fifth step and was moving toward the sixth step.</p><p>The power of the fifth step, Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, was definitely comparable to the highest level of demigod-level martial techniques.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
