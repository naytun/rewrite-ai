It was naturally impossible for his bloodline to not improve.</p><p>...</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline and the nine Dragons bloodline had both advanced by one level, reaching the second level of the divine level.</p><p>When the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline reached level two of the divine level, the prison-suppressing heavenly technique’s power increased again, reaching the power of an upper-grade demigod martial technique. However, it should be equivalent to the first stage of an upper-grade demigod martial technique.</p><p>Even so, its power was still several times stronger than the highest level of a low-grade demigod martial technique.</p><p>A high-grade demigod martial technique was usually only mastered by a spirit embryo realm expert. Only then could it unleash its full power, and its might was terrifying.</p><p>When his nine Dragon bloodline advanced to the second level of the divine level, Lu Ming realized that there was an additional dragon energy. There were two dragon energies in his bloodline.</p><p>This made Lu Ming look forward to the upgrade of his Blood Meridian even more.</p><p>However, when it came to divine bloodlines, it was even more difficult to upgrade one’s bloodline.</p><p>However, the third bloodline had yet to awaken. It was as if it was still brewing and accumulating. This made Lu Ming feel rather helpless. He could only wait.</p><p>“Let’s go. Follow me to hunt demonic beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed Wang haoxian.</p><p>In the past five months, Lu Ming had not engaged in any major battles. He had spent most of his time cultivating.</p><p>It was not possible to just cultivate blindly. There must be a great battle. Only by combining the two could one cultivate the path of martial arts.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to kill the demonic beasts in the wild beast mountain range while collecting blood essence. Once the nine suns Supreme woke up, he would head to the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>He had agreed to meet Xie nianqing and Kong Jin at the sea Cloud sect half a year later.</p><p>Wang haoxian bit his lips and followed behind Lu Ming. He did not know what she was thinking.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered. She and Wang haoxian went deep into the wild beast forest in search of high-level demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to hunt demonic beasts at the fifth and sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm. Their blood essence was too poor for him.</p><p>He had to at least hunt demonic beasts at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier and above.</p><p>Very quickly, the two of them had travelled a distance of a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A giant black bear, ten meters tall, with blood-red eyes, exuded a terrifying and powerful aura.</p><p>This was a demonic beast at the peak of the seventh level spiritual ocean realm. It charged at Lu Ming fearlessly.</p><p>A spear light condensed in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the spear light pierced through the void and pierced through the giant bear’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming could casually kill an ordinary cultivator at the peak seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>The devouring power burst out from his palm, devouring the giant bear’s blood essence and refining it.</p><p>The refining power of the second level divine level nine Dragon bloodline was extremely terrifying. In just a few minutes, the giant bear’s blood essence was completely refined.</p><p>The two of them continued to venture deeper. Not long after, a demonic beast at the eighth level of the spiritual ocean tier appeared, but it was still easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>As the two of them advanced, the number of demonic beasts at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm and above that had died at Lu Ming’s hands reached ten.</p><p>Lu Ming used it to upgrade the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. It did not cause any waves.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud noise in front of them. Sword Qi soared into the sky, and there were roars of demonic beasts. There were people fighting with demonic beasts.</p><p>In the wild beast mountain range, there were often people who entered to hunt demonic beasts, obtain materials, and also look for some spiritual herbs.</p><p>Lu Ming was not bothered. He bypassed that place and continued to move forward.</p><p>Before long, they had traveled another ten thousand miles.</p><p>“Eh? That seems to be a blood flower!”</p><p>Suddenly, a few spiritual flowers appeared in front of him.</p><p>The spiritual flower was dark red in color, and it gave off a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>The blood flower was an upper level six spiritual medicine. Although Lu Ming did not think much of it, he would not miss it since he had seen it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to walk over, there was a buzzing sound in the sky. A group of dark red flying insects flew toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There were at least ten thousand of these dark red insects.</p><p>“A bloodstain bug that’s equivalent to a peak-tier King!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and recognized this type of flying insect.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move, but Wang haoxian did. With a wave of her hand, purple flames filled the air and enveloped the sky. The next moment, tens of thousands of blood bugs were burned to ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of air being torn could be heard as seven to eight figures flew over at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Little fellow, those blood-stained flowers are ours!”</p><p>An old voice rang out. Eight figures appeared and stood above Lu Ming and the others. A vast aura filled the air.</p><p>These eight people were no doubt experts. Five were at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm, and three were at the eighth level. No wonder they dared to venture so deep into the wild beast forest.</p><p>Among the eight people, there were white-haired old men and middle-aged men.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Little Zi, what did you say? Don’t you know how to respect your elders at such a young age? It seems that I have to teach you a good lesson on behalf of your elders!”</p><p>A short and chubby old man looked furious and glared at Lu Ming with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>A tremendous aura, the aura of the peak seventh level spiritual ocean realm, filled the air and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you still don’t get lost, kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at the short and fat old man. He walked towards the blood-stained flower. He was talking to Wang haoxian.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The short and fat old man roared in anger. A saber appeared in his hand. In a flash, he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the next moment, a figure appeared in front of the old man. A scorching aura filled the air as he threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The short and fat old man was like a firework, instantly turning into a flame and exploding, not even leaving a residue.</p><p>“Sky-burning flames, the Wang family’s sky-burning flames!”</p><p>she’s so young and yet so powerful. Could she be the Wang clan’s God-tier prodigy, Wang haoxian? ”</p><p>It should be her!</p><p>The other seven people exclaimed.</p><p>They came from a big force in ninedragons, but that force was much weaker than the Wang family.</p><p>“Get lost, or die!” Wang haoxian shouted coldly.</p><p>The eyes of the seven people flashed with deep fear.</p><p>Although their cultivation was high, they still felt deep respect for such a God-tier heaven’s favorite.</p><p>The battle prowess of a God-tier heaven’s favorite was too strong. It couldn’t be measured by cultivation.</p><p>But what shocked them the most was that Wang haoxian seemed to listen to the young man.</p><p>Just now, the young man had given Wang haoxian an order.</p><p>Who was that young man? It was unbelievable that he could command a God-level talent like Wang haoxian.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with a look of awe.</p><p>haha, it was a misunderstanding. Let’s go, we’ll leave immediately!</p><p>The other seven people laughed and flew forward at top speed, deep into the wild beast forest.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered and picked the blood-stained flower.</p><p>After that, he continued to search for demonic beasts to kill.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.</p><p>OWW! Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, the earth-shaking roars of a few demonic beasts came from the front.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the rest saw two figures flying wildly outside with frightened faces. These two people were two of the group who had wanted to snatch the blood-stained flower.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
