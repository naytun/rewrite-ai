However, he was only among the younger generation.</p><p>...</p><p>Moreover, even among the younger generation, he might not be a match for di Feng, Shi mo, and the others, not to mention that there were still geniuses in the top 100 on the list of top 1000.</p><p>He was only from the younger generation. If he were to be compared to the ancient families, the Emperor heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, or the ancient sacred dynasty of the central continent, he was still far from them.</p><p>He seemed so powerless in the face of such a force.</p><p>“Power, power!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept growling in his heart.</p><p>sixteenth Princess, I’ve already agreed. Please leave with me now!</p><p>The venerable protector said.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s delicate body trembled. Suddenly, she leaned over and pressed her red lips against Lu Ming’s. At this moment, their lips were touching each other and the two of them seemed to be one.</p><p>“Bitch!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Xie Zhen’s eyes as he shouted in a low voice.</p><p>However, at this moment, no one was paying attention to Xie Zhen. Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>After a long time, the two lips separated.</p><p>Two drops of tears fell on Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll wait for you. I won’t die no matter how much I’ve suffered. I’ll wait for you. I’ll wait for the day you rule the world. When you rule the world, we’ll hold hands and be together, never to be apart!”</p><p>His voice echoed in Lu Ming’s ears, but Xie nianqing had already left and landed beside the venerable Guardian.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if there was a huge rock blocking his chest, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>“Miss nianqing!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan’s eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>Wang haoxian also looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing with a complicated expression.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, I’m going to call that old fart over!”</p><p>The fat man growled, his fat trembling.</p><p>a sovereign descending to the world? what a joke. An ant wants to defy the heavens? what a good dream. Venerable one, let’s go!</p><p>Xie Zhen laughed coldly and came to the side of the venerable Guardian, b * tch, beast race, when I return this time, I’ll definitely make you go to the demon Realm of hell. Just you wait!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the venerable Guardian took Xie nianqing, Xie Zhen, and the man and woman, turning into a ray of light and disappearing.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction that Xie nianqing had left in and felt lost.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Fatty said.</p><p>That was because someone from the sky demon Valley was looking at them with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>The combat strength displayed by Lu Ming was too terrifying. Even the Prince of the ancient sacred dynasty of the central continent, Xie Zhen, who had awakened a fifth level divine level bloodline and reached the peak of the seventh level spiritual ocean realm, was suppressed by Lu Ming. He was too powerful.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was seriously injured, they had other thoughts.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Fatty wrapped Lu Ming up with his vital essence and in a flash, they left the place, followed by ruan Tingting and the rest.</p><p>The eyes of the sky demon Valley cultivators flickered, but they did not pursue.</p><p>After all, this was the Emperor heaven divine Palace, not the sky demon Valley. If they chased after the geniuses of the Emperor heaven divine Palace openly, would the people of the Emperor heaven divine Palace allow it? Otherwise, he would lose all his face.</p><p>“What an interesting little fellow!”</p><p>Black wind Knight smiled and continued, ” you guys can continue with the competition. I’m leaving!</p><p>A gust of black wind blew past, and black wind Knight’s figure disappeared.</p><p>the two of you, now that aokun is dead and Lu Ming has retreated with serious injuries, why don’t we start the competition again from the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier? ”</p><p>Di Feng looked in the direction that Lu Ming and the others had left in, then turned to the corpse demon and the Golden-robed young man.</p><p>“I have no objections!” The demonic corpse said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The gold-robed youth could only nod.</p><p>The exchange continued, but Lu Ming and the rest had nothing to do with it.</p><p>A million miles away, in a Hidden Valley, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, fully focused on healing his injuries.</p><p>Previously, when he was pointed at by the protector of the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent, even though the other party did not use much strength, he was still severely injured, and his bones were broken into hundreds of pieces.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a physical injury. His internal organs were only minor injuries. With Lu Ming’s current physical strength and cultivation, he could recover very quickly.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, five days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries had already healed and he was at his peak.</p><p>In a flash, Wang haoxian appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“How’s the investigation going?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Two days ago, Lu Ming had asked Wang haoxian to investigate the whereabouts of Xie Zhen and the others, and whether they were still in ninedragons.</p><p>Previously, Xie Zhen had said that they had come to the East barren mainly to form an alliance with a few major forces. Forming an alliance was a major event. Lu Ming guessed that Xie Zhen and the others would not leave so soon.</p><p>Thus, he sent Wang haoxian to investigate.</p><p>the people from the central continent are still here. They haven’t left and are living in the sea waves ancient garden on the other dragon vein!</p><p>Wang haoxian answered honestly.</p><p>“Hai LAN ancient garden? En, I know!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and closed his eyes again.</p><p>Not far away, fatty, ruan Tingting, and Qiao Xuan were discussing something.</p><p>“Why do you think Lu Ming sent Wang haoxian to find out where those people from the central continent are staying? Don’t tell me you want to save miss nianqing? With Lu Ming’s cultivation level, he will definitely die if he goes!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said in a low voice.</p><p>that’s right. The other party has a venerable. We’ll definitely die if we go. We still have to keep an eye on Lu Ming and don’t let him mess around!</p><p>Fatty nodded.</p><p>Another day passed. Lu Ming sat still. At this moment, Xie nianqing’s image kept flashing in his mind.</p><p>The two of them had first met in the ruins of the Dongyi ancestors in the blazing sun Empire. At first, they had fought and Xie nianqing had suffered a great loss.</p><p>Later on, in the blazing sun Kingdom, the two of them met again. After that, the two of them experienced many things together.</p><p>The sentence ‘I want to step on you’ kept echoing in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>After going through so much together, Xie nianqing’s image had been deeply engraved in his heart. Similarly, his image had also been deeply engraved in Xie nianqing’s heart. It was difficult to erase it.</p><p>When you rule the world, you and I will hold hands and never separate!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s words still rang in her ears.</p><p>However, it would be many years before he could rule the world. Moreover, there was still the mountain, Di Yi and Martial Emperor, standing in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was still unknown whether he could overcome the great mountain of Di Yi and Martial Emperor. If he failed, wouldn’t Xie nianqing have to stay in the ancient dynasty of central continent for the rest of her life, in the place where she had suffered?</p><p>“Little Qing, when you suddenly disappeared for two years, were you also brought back to the central continent? But then, you ran out again!”</p><p>“Since you don’t want to go back to that home and that home will make you suffer, I won’t let you go! When I rule the world, that’s too long. I only strive for the present!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming opened his eyes. There seemed to be two rays of spear light in his eyes, piercing through the air and into the clouds.</p><p>With a flash, fatty and the rest appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have you recovered from your injuries?”</p><p>Fatty asked.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!” Lu Ming nodded. you guys leave ninedragons first. I have something to do! he continued.</p><p>The Fatty’s expression changed as he said,”Lu Ming, you’re not going to save miss nianqing, are you?” No, if you go like this, you’re just going to die!”</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, you can’t go.” Ruan Tingting also said anxiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
