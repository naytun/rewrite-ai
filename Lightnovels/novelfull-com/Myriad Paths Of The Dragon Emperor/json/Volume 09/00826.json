Whoever doesn’t let you in, I’ll kick him away!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>Qiao Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p>Immediately, Qiao Xuan spoke to her father, Qiao long, and Qiao long naturally agreed.</p><p>For Qiao Xuan to be able to attend such a gathering, it would definitely increase her knowledge and insight. It would be of great help to her future cultivation.</p><p>Immediately, the group flew toward the center of ninedragons.</p><p>A journey of tens of millions of miles was not long for them. They chatted as they flew, neither fast nor slow.</p><p>They arrived in less than a day.</p><p>From tens of thousands of miles away, a majestic mountain range could be seen in the distance. It was one of the three dragon veins in the center of ninedragons.</p><p>After traveling tens of thousands of miles, countless buildings appeared in front of them.</p><p>There were all kinds of palaces, pavilions, and even shops. There was everything one could think of.</p><p>This seemed to be a city, but this city had no city walls. It was just countless buildings.</p><p>People were coming and going in the building, and it was very lively.</p><p>The group walked in and found that there were restaurants, inns, shops, and everything one could think of.</p><p>In ninedragons, there were countless people and a vast territory. There were many specialized gathering places. In some places, city walls would be built, such as the Grand gathering city.</p><p>Some places didn’t even need city walls, just like what they saw.</p><p>The group strolled along the streets.</p><p>“Tingting, is the exchange on the Dragon vein?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right, and it’s at the dragon’s head, under the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Why don’t we go and take a look first? ” Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very curious. The group of them passed through the buildings and flew in the direction of the dragon’s head.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the dragon’s head.</p><p>At the dragon’s head, there was an extremely wide flat land. In the middle of the flat land, there was a huge fighting stage with many seats around it.</p><p>According to ruan Tingting, this was the place where the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had held their grand events in the past. For example, grand events such as a worship to the heavens or a competition between geniuses would be held here.</p><p>As such, the gathering that would be held a few days later was also held here.</p><p>However, this was not what attracted everyone’s attention. Everyone’s eyes were completely attracted by a large cauldron in front of the open space.</p><p>At the forefront of the dragon’s head, there was a huge cauldron. The cauldron was pitch-black and as large as a mountain. It reached into the clouds and was at least several thousand meters tall.</p><p>From a distance, it looked extremely majestic. One could see true dragons spiraling around the cauldron, looking extremely life-like.</p><p>this is the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. At the head of each of the nine dragon veins, there is a Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Legend has it that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was there when nine Dragon City was built. No one knows how many years have passed since then. It is said that it is a Supreme treasure used by ancient experts to suppress the nine dragon veins!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Supreme treasure? Why didn’t anyone take it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>no one can take it away, not even the strong cultivators of the Imperial path. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron has been in this world for a long time, never moving. It seems to have merged with the Dragon vein and has existed since ancient times!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He looked at the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron in the distance in amazement.</p><p>As for fatty, Xie nianqing, Qiao Xuan, and the others, although they had heard of it before, it was their first time seeing it. They were also shocked.</p><p>There were nine huge cauldrons with real Dragons carved on them. They were several thousand meters tall and had existed since ancient times. It was indeed a magnificent sight.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were not the only ones nearby. There were many other people who stopped in their tracks to watch.</p><p>“Eh? It seems that someone is approaching the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>The others also saw that a burly young man was walking toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron exudes a huge pressure. Unless you’re an expert, you can’t approach it!</p><p>Wang haoxian, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke.</p><p>“Let’s go up and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and strode forward.</p><p>When they were within 10000 meters of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, they felt a huge pressure emanating from the cauldron.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and there was a look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>Just as he was within 10000 meters of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he suddenly felt that the bloodline of the nine Dragons was somewhat strange. It seemed to be a little anxious, but also a little excited.</p><p>“What’s going on? Is it because of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that the bloodline of the nine Dragons is different?”</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is known as the nine Dragons. There are pictures of real Dragons carved on it to suppress the Dragon veins. Perhaps it really has something to do with Dragons, which is why the bloodlines of the nine Dragons are abnormal!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed in his heart.</p><p>They endured the pressure and continued forward.</p><p>Very soon, Qiao Xuan could not take it anymore and stopped in her tracks while Lu Ming and the rest continued forward.</p><p>The closer he got, the more he felt the magnificence of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It was tall and magnificent, full of vicissitudes, as if it had crossed time and space from ancient times.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline in Lu Ming’s body seemed to be even more anxious and excited. The power of the bloodline seemed to be boiling.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In front of him was a burly young man who kept walking forward. His muscles were tight and his qi and blood were soaring. The qi and blood formed a Dragon that was roaring.</p><p>“That’s not a human, it’s a demon, a flood Dragon!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell that the burly young man in front of him was not a human, but a flood Dragon. He must be a genius from the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Demonic beast level six, able to transform.</p><p>The demon youth walked forward step by step until he reached the bottom of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. He took a look at the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and actually reached out his hands to hold a corner of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>haha, that flood Dragon is really whimsical. He actually wants to hold the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. In his dreams, that’s a treasure that even emperors can’t touch!</p><p>Someone sneered in the distance.</p><p>Sure enough, the flood Dragon roared at the sky, but the cauldron didn’t move.</p><p>In the end, the flood Dragon even revealed its true form. It was a Scarlet Flood Dragon over two hundred meters long. It grabbed the cauldron with its claws, but the cauldron didn’t move at all.</p><p>In the end, the flood Dragon had no choice but to return to his human form and step by step, he retreated.</p><p>At this moment, the nine Dragon bloodline in Lu Ming’s body became even more violent, as if it was about to rush out of his body.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He controlled the nine Dragon bloodline. He could not let the nine Dragon bloodline appear here. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if word got out.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately retreated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the nine Dragon bloodline seemed to let out a shocking roar. The roar came from Lu Ming’s body, but no one else could hear it.</p><p>But at this moment, a shocking scene happened.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron in front of him suddenly shook.</p><p>Suddenly, the Dragon veins trembled and the wind and clouds changed. A terrifying pressure burst out from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest hurriedly retreated. After retreating ten thousand meters, the pressure was much less.</p><p>After the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook for a while, it became still again, as if everything that had just happened was an illusion.</p><p>However, the scene was already in an uproar.</p><p>Everyone felt it. It couldn’t be an illusion. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which hadn’t moved for ages, actually moved. What was going on?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
