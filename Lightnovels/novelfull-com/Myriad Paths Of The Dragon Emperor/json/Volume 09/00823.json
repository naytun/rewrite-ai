In such a large domain, there were only 300 people. How rare was that?</p><p>Even with the addition of some rising stars, it wouldn’t be too much.</p><p>Therefore, under normal circumstances, it was rare to see a battle between God-tier geniuses.</p><p>It was only before the battle of Providence, when all the Supreme geniuses gathered, that there would be clashes between God-level Supreme geniuses. As time passed and the battle of Providence neared, the clashes between God-level Supreme geniuses would definitely increase and become more intense.</p><p>haha, Blood Sword 19, are you finally going to fight? I’ll play with you!</p><p>Long Qianli laughed and stepped onto the stone platform.</p><p>long Qianli, you’ve misunderstood. This time, I’m not the one fighting. It’s my Junior Brother, GUI Yue. You can fight!</p><p>Blood Sword 19 laughed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Blood Sword 19’s voice fell, a figure flashed and suddenly appeared in front of long Qianli.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Many people were shocked. They almost didn’t see when ghost moon appeared in front of long Qianli. It was as if he had been standing there the whole time.</p><p>“You’re ghost moon?” long Qianli asked with a frown.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>GUI Yue was born indifferently. Looking at her appearance, she was very young, not more than 25 years old.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered because the name GUI Yue was very unfamiliar. He wasn’t on the list of top 1000 talents at all. He should be a newly rising heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Long Qianli did not let his guard down at all. A powerful aura emanated from his body as a black spear appeared in his hand. The spear radiance soared into the sky.</p><p>Peak sixth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Just like Wang haoxian, long Qianli’s cultivation had also reached the peak sixth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>His eyes were bright as he stared at ghost moon.</p><p>Since ghost moon dared to fight him, she must be a God-tier heaven’s favorite. She must be very powerful, and he naturally didn’t dare to underestimate her.</p><p>However, ghost moon shook his head and said, ” “You’re not my match!”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the scene was in an uproar.</p><p>this guy is so arrogant. We haven’t even fought yet and he’s already saying that long Qianli is no match for him. He’s too narcissistic.</p><p>that’s right. Who is long Qianli? he’s a God-tier prodigy. How dare he talk so big!</p><p>“How detestable! Brother long, teach him a good lesson!”</p><p>Some people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace roared in anger, feeling extremely indignant.</p><p>“Make your move. Weizhan, you’re too full of yourself!”</p><p>Long Qianli’s eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>He had been looked down upon even before the battle. A genius like him was naturally unhappy.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A scimitar appeared in ghost moon’s hand, ” I’ve already said that you’re not my match. If you add her, it’ll be interesting!</p><p>Then, he pointed his scimitar at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang haoxian, you’re also a God-tier heaven’s favorite. Come at me together with long Qianli. I’m more interested in fighting you!</p><p>Ghost moon said indifferently. His tone was not loud, but it revealed a strong self-confidence.</p><p>Wang haoxian frowned and his eyes were sharp.</p><p>Since he was challenged in public, there was no reason for him not to fight.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming. If she wanted to fight, she had to get Lu Ming’s permission.</p><p>“If you want to fight, just go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Many people’s jaws almost dropped. Wang haoxian had to get Lu Ming’s permission to fight?</p><p>Could it be that Wang haoxian had been conquered by Lu Ming and had become his woman?</p><p>Many people could not help but have this thought. They looked at Lu Ming with a look of jealousy and envy.</p><p>In fact, many of them even looked at him with admiration.</p><p>To be able to conquer a woman like Wang haoxian, he had to be impressed.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and pouted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose, pretending that he did not see it.</p><p>Wang haoxian nodded. He took a step forward and appeared on the stone platform.</p><p>long Qianli, since he wants to challenge us, let’s fight!</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly. A terrifying heat emanated from his body, and purple flames erupted.</p><p>alright, since this person is so confident, he must have some capital. Be careful!</p><p>Long Qianli sent a voice transmission to Wang haoxian. His aura grew stronger and he pointed his spear at ghost moon.”Make your move!”</p><p>“Hehe, interesting!”</p><p>Ghost moon sneered, and a black light burst out from his body. In the black light, there were countless figures screaming, giving off a horrifying aura.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! GUI Yue shouted coldly. His body disappeared in a flash. The next moment, a cold light slashed at long Qianli’s throat.</p><p>Without a doubt, ghost moon’s cultivation was also at the peak sixth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Long Qianli’s long spear shook and instantly struck forward, clashing with the saber Light. With a clang, the saber Light was repelled, but in the next moment, the saber Light appeared at Wang haoxian’s throat.</p><p>Wang haoxian punched out with both fists, and the scorching fist radiance burned everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blade light was destroyed, and a figure flashed and appeared in front of him. It was ghost moon.</p><p>you have some skills. Next, let’s get to the main topic!</p><p>As soon as ghost moon’s voice fell, endless black Qi filled the air. Within the black Qi, ghostly wails and wolf howls could be heard. The sound was miserable and extremely harsh.</p><p>On the stone platform, many people’s faces turned pale and they spat out a mouthful of blood. They were shocked and retreated quickly, shouting, ” this is the will of evil ghost. Don’t get too close!</p><p>Many people quickly retreated and only dared to stop after they had retreated a long distance.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a wall of vital essence appeared in front of him, blocking the spread of the will of evil ghosts.</p><p>The evil ghost intent domain was extremely strange. It could affect one’s soul and mind through the wailing of ghosts and howls of wolves. It was a kind of intent domain similar to sound waves.</p><p>Long Qianli and Wang haoxian’s expressions turned serious as they unleashed their wills to resist.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the same time, the two of them attacked at the same time. A violent attack was launched at ghost moon.</p><p>“Ghostmoon saber art!”</p><p>you’re too weak, ” GUI Yue said softly. Her body trembled and disappeared again. The next moment, countless saber lights suddenly flashed on the stone platform and continuously slashed at long Qianli and Wang haoxian.</p><p>Each blade light was extremely powerful, fast, and at an extremely tricky angle. No one knew where they would come from. It was as if there could be blade lights coming from any corner of the stone platform.</p><p>“What a strange cultivation technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed as he stared at the stone platform.</p><p>Ghost moon’s attack naturally couldn’t escape his eyes.</p><p>He found that ghost moon’s body seemed to have become one with the will of the evil ghost. Wherever the will of the evil ghost was, his body could reach it in an instant. It was fast and vicious, extremely strange.</p><p>The only way to break this attack was to use a powerful method to break through the will of the evil ghost.</p><p>Obviously, long Qianli and Wang haoxian had thought of it too.</p><p>With a Dragon’s Roar, a three-headed demon flood Dragon with a dazzling golden chakra appeared above long Qianli’s head.</p><p>At the same time, Wang haoxian’s divine bloodline also burst out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
