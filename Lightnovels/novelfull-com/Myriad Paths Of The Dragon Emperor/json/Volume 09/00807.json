Before his accident, he had left behind some hidden immortal’s caves in some places.</p><p>...</p><p>There was one in the wild beast forest, and no one knew about this secret cave abode except for the nine suns Supreme Master himself.</p><p>Just now, he had woken up from his deep sleep because he was close to the cave dwelling of the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>The nine suns cosmos supremacy told Lu Ming the approximate location.</p><p>I’ll go in two days. Let’s delay this Wang haoxian for a few days!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>For the next three days, Lu Ming did not venture deep into the wild beast forest. Instead, he led Wang haoxian in circles on the outskirts of the forest.</p><p>They passed the message for three days. Their speed was on par. Lu Ming could not shake off Wang haoxian, and Wang haoxian could not catch up to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I don’t believe that your true essence is as abundant as mine!”</p><p>Wang haoxian shrieked, his eyes blazing with anger.</p><p>It had been three days. She had been chasing Lu Ming for three days. Her killing intent towards Lu Ming had not lessened. Instead, it had become stronger.</p><p>“I can almost shake her off!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It had been almost four days. Xie nianqing and Kong Jin should have refined the flame aura left behind by Wang haoxian and entered the tianqiong relic.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming planned to leave Wang haoxian behind and head to the cave abode left behind by the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and flew forward at top speed. A Lake appeared in front of him and he rushed into the lake. Then, with a thought, he entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to escape from the bottom of the lake!”</p><p>In the next moment, Wang haoxian caught up with him. With a palm strike, scorching flames spread out and the entire lake water evaporated in an instant. Mist filled the air and only the dry bottom of the lake was left. Lu Ming, on the other hand, had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>damn it, could it be that he left through the underground? don’t even think about it!</p><p>Wang haoxian roared and punched. The ground cracked and rocks and dirt flew, but Lu Ming was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Wang haoxian went crazy and started to search the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to care about all of this.</p><p>In the Supreme shrine, he began to devour spiritual crystals to recover.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming’s cultivation had fully recovered and he was back at his peak.</p><p>At this moment, he left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>There was no trace of Wang haoxian. Lu Ming was heading in the direction that the nine suns Supreme had pointed out.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>After flying for thousands of miles, Lu Ming suddenly rushed into the forest below. With a wave of his hands, an inscription array that concealed his aura appeared on his body, completely concealing his aura.</p><p>Not long after, they saw Wang haoxian flying past them with a gloomy face. This woman really wouldn’t stop until she was dead.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not fly in the sky. Instead, he shuttled through the forest. Since he had an inscription formation that concealed his aura, he could easily avoid the monstrous beasts. Lu Ming’s speed was still very fast.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming had run for thousands of miles and appeared at the bottom of a huge cliff.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, the entrance to the cave you mentioned is on the cliff? But how come I didn’t notice it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“There is a mark on the cliff, so the entrance is there.”</p><p>The voice of the nine suns Supreme Master rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and indeed, he found a mark on a cliff.</p><p>Lu Ming observed it carefully and pushed it with his hand. It did not move at all. It did not seem like there was an entrance. Similarly, Lu Ming did not find any traces of inscriptions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve set up a formation that alternated between illusion and reality here. This formation is extremely mysterious. If you think of this place as real, it’s real. If you think of it as virtual, then this cliff doesn’t exist and it’s virtual. You’ll naturally enter the cave abode with one step.”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“It’s actually a formation that alternated between illusion and reality!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This array was very advanced. Even Lu Ming did not know how to use it.</p><p>Setting up such a formation to protect the cave abode could be said to be foolproof.</p><p>For example, if you set up a formation at the entrance of a cave, this formation would allow the cave to become one with the surrounding environment and look exactly the same. Ordinary people would only think that it was a mountain when they saw it. Even if they walked over, they would feel that it was a mountain.</p><p>However, if you thought that this place was a cave, then you could walk over and enter the cave. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Therefore, even if someone had come here over the years, they would not stare at a cliff and think that it was an immortal’s cave. This was the entrance, unless it was someone who knew about it.</p><p>Moreover, the inscription formation that could see the real and the fake could perfectly integrate with the surrounding environment, making it difficult to sense the existence of inscriptions.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode towards the cliff. Just as he was about to crash into the cliff, he saw that the cliff was empty. Lu Ming’s body had disappeared from the cliff.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in and found himself in a huge cave abode.</p><p>The cave abode was rather large, but it was very simple and crude. There was only a stone bed, a stone table, and a few stone stools. On the table was a Jade box, and in the jade box were a few storage rings.</p><p>In the innermost part of the cave, there were two small trees. The small trees were as tall as a person, and their leaves were dark green, emitting a strange aura.</p><p>On the small tree, there were a few fruits.</p><p>“The soul-consolidating tree has really borne fruit!”</p><p>The figure of the nine suns Supreme Master appeared. He looked at the two small trees and revealed a happy expression.</p><p>“Soul concentrating tree?” Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>the soul-consolidating tree and the soul-consolidating fruit are very helpful to the spirit and soul. I found them by accident and planted them here. I didn’t expect them to bear fruit. With these two soul-consolidating trees and soul-consolidating fruits, I can recover a portion of my soul power!</p><p>Supreme martial artist ninesuns explained.</p><p>“Congratulations, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as well. He was also looking forward to the recovery of the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll be recuperating under the soul-consolidating tree for a while. I think it’ll take some time. There are some things I left here in those storage rings. Although there aren’t any rare treasures, they should be useful to you.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he flew toward the two soul condensing fruit trees, plucked one of the fruits, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up and walked to the stone table. He picked up one of the storage rings and immersed his mind into it.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This storage ring was filled with spirit weapons and all sorts of blacksmithing materials.</p><p>Among them, most of the spiritual weapons were at the sixth level. There were also seventh level and even eighth level spiritual weapons.</p><p>Shocking, it was too shocking. It should be known that only those at the spirit embryo realm could unleash the full power of a seventh level spiritual weapon. As for an eighth level spiritual weapon, it could only be unleashed by an existence at the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>And in this storage ring, not only did he have them, he had quite a few of them.</p><p>And those materials for refining weapons were also rare materials.</p><p>If these spirit weapons and blacksmithing materials were to be taken out, their value would be immeasurable.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it happily.</p><p>Zhang xuan turned his attention to the second storage ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
