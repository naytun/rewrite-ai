He had inscribed a level Seven array formation, the golden light ten thousand killing array. This array formation was very powerful even among Level Seven array formations and could kill spirit embryo realm experts.</p><p>...</p><p>However, it was too difficult and extremely dangerous to inscribe a formation with one’s body.</p><p>How powerful was the killing formation? if one wasn’t careful, they would be killed and their bodies would be reduced to ashes.</p><p>No one expected Ji mai to be able to inscribe a formation with his body.</p><p>it should be an incomplete formation. It’s not complete yet. Otherwise, it would be even more powerful!</p><p>Some of the older generation saw through the situation.</p><p>Many people nodded. That should be the case. If it was a complete formation, Meng Jia’s puppet would probably be crushed to pieces with a single sword strike. It would definitely not just be severely injured.</p><p>However, even if it was not the complete golden light ten thousand killing array, it was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, it was difficult for a rank 6 Alchemist’s spiritual power to unleash the full power of a rank 7 formation.</p><p>if Ji mai can complete the formation and inscribe the complete golden light ten thousand killing formation, his combat strength will be extremely shocking. He will be able to fight against the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>that’s right. If I perfect the array and become a level-seven Alchemist, it will be even more powerful!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“Meng Jia, do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Ji Mai’s eyes were shining with a sharp light, as if there was a sword light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“You actually completed carving the formation with your body. I’m impressed. I’m not your match. This battle is meaningless. I admit defeat!”</p><p>Meng Jia directly admitted defeat.</p><p>Meng Jia admitted defeat and Meng Chong announced Ji Mai’s victory.</p><p>Next, Meng Chong announced the second round.</p><p>Tianyun assimilated with Meng Jia, and Ji mai assimilated with Yan.</p><p>Meng Chong seemed to have intentionally left Ji mai and tianyun for the last.</p><p>“I admit defeat in this battle!”</p><p>In the fighting ring, Meng Jia faced Lu Ming and admitted defeat.</p><p>Her mental energy was on par with Yan Tong’s. If she fought with Lu Ming, he would definitely take the puppet away in the end. There was no point in fighting.</p><p>Her final battle was to compete with Yan Tongtong for third place.</p><p>As expected, Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia had the same thoughts and admitted defeat when they faced Ji mai.</p><p>He knew that he was no match for Ji mai, so he might as well save his psyche and fight Meng Jia.</p><p>At this point, tianyun and Ji mai had won both of their battles and had already locked in the top three spots, locking in the spot for the observatory.</p><p>in the third round, Yan Tong will fight Meng Jia, and tianyun will fight Ji mai!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>The atmosphere became even more heated.</p><p>The competition had finally reached the final round.</p><p>These two matches were able to arouse the curiosity in everyone’s heart.</p><p>Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia, the two paragons of the puppet sect, were only a few places apart on the list of top 1000 talents. Who was stronger?</p><p>Ji mai and Tian Yun were the most interesting.</p><p>Ji mai had actually mastered the extremely difficult and dangerous technique of carving formations with his body. His combat power was extremely strong.</p><p>Tianyun, the dark horse, seemed to have appeared out of thin air. The moment he appeared, he was appointed as a zongzi candidate by the two sect leaders and the elders. This shocked the entire Mount Liangyi.</p><p>Earlier, he had displayed a terrifying martial arts combat strength.</p><p>The talent in inscription that was revealed in the competition this time was also extremely shocking.</p><p>Between Lu Ming and Ji mai, who was stronger?</p><p>Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>Under everyone’s anticipation, the competition began.</p><p>First, it was Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia who were fighting for third place.</p><p>The two of them were both puppets. As soon as the battle began, it was incomparably intense. The collisions between the puppets were violent, direct, and brutal, causing thunderous rumbles to ring out continuously.</p><p>Both of them had similar spiritual power and the same level of their spiritual fire. They were both in the early stage of ‘heart limit’.</p><p>It could be said that they were evenly matched. The two of them fought for a full half an hour. In the end, Yan Tong, who was more tenacious, won by a slight advantage.</p><p>In this way, Yan Tongtong finally secured the third place.</p><p>Then, the last battle between Tian Yu and Ji mai began.</p><p>The two of them stepped onto the fighting ring and stood opposite each other.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Who do you guys think will win, tianyun or Ji mai?”</p><p>now it seems like Ji mai has a higher chance of winning. After all, he has cultivated the golden light ten thousand killing formation. It’s so powerful that no one can resist it!</p><p>I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. Tianyun’s methods are varied and he’s skilled in many formations. Furthermore, his psyche is extremely powerful. Who knows if he has other tricks up his sleeve? ”</p><p>“That’s true. This match is going to be interesting!”</p><p>Gradually, the noise around them quieted down, and the crowd stared at the two people on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Tianyun, I will not hold back in this battle. Be careful!”</p><p>Ji mai reminded.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I want, you can just attack as much as you want!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stared at Ji mai.</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying aura emanated from Ji Mai’s body. Dense runes appeared on his skin.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ji mai waved his hand and a terrifying sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and 12 puppets appeared. They roared and rushed towards Ji mai.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A giant wolf puppet at Class 9 Lv 6 was cut in half by the sword light, but the other puppets didn’t stop and continued to attack.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming stomped his feet and waved his hands, starting to inscribe an array on the ground.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Ji mai waved his hands and beams of sword light flashed. Lu Ming controlled the puppets to attack and block the sword light.</p><p>Among the 12 puppets, six of them were at Class 9 Lv 6, and they were quickly cut in half and turned into scrap metal. The other six were at Class 10 lv 6, and were severely injured.</p><p>However, it managed to hold them off for a full ten breaths, buying enough time for Lu Ming to inscribe the formation.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A large formation appeared around Lu Ming. Sword Qi whistled and Thunder rumbled.</p><p>The endless sword Qi shot towards Ji mai.</p><p>It was a top grade level six formation technique, the sword howling Thunder formation.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They did not expect Lu Ming to be able to inscribe a top-tier level-six formation in just ten breaths.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ji mai shouted and waved his hands. The inscriptions on his body glowed and a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>The sword radiance slashed violently, clashing with the sword howling Thunder formation. At the same time, Lu Ming continued to inscribe the formation.</p><p>Although the thunderous sword formation was strong, it was still unable to fight against Ji mai. Soon, the formation was broken by Ji mai.</p><p>However, in the next moment, another formation of Lu Ming appeared. Countless vines, lush and green, wrapped around Ji mai.</p><p>It was another top-tier level-six formation.</p><p>Ji Mai’s sword flashed and countless sword Qi rumbled as he slashed at the vines. However, the vines were extremely tough and he couldn’t cut them at all.</p><p>By the time Ji mai broke the formation, Lu Ming had already finished inscribing the other two top-notch level-six formations and was waiting for him.</p><p>too fast, tianyun’s formation carving speed is too fast!</p><p>that’s right. His usage of mental energy fire is not as simple as the early stage of ‘heart’s will’. It feels even more terrifying than the middle stage of’ heart’s will’!</p><p>it can’t be. Could it be that he has already reached the late stage of ‘heart limit’? that’s a realm that only a seventh-rank advanced Alchemist can reach!</p><p>Many people speculated that Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was at a very high level and they were extremely shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
