He stared at Meng Chong and said, ” “Meng Chong, what are you shouting for? Are you surprised to see me?”</p><p>“Hmph! Of course I’m surprised to see you. Who doesn’t know about the battle in ninedragons? Yan kuangtu, so you escaped from ninedragons and came to Mount Liangyi to seek refuge with our Talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>“Bai Shijin, you’ve gathered us here to discuss Yan kuangtu’s surrender, right? I object. If Martial Emperor Di Yi knows that Yan kuangtu has joined us, he will start a war with the talisman Amulet sect. It will not be worth it!”</p><p>Meng Chong shouted.</p><p>that’s right. Although Yan kuangtu’s combat strength is strong, it’s not worth it to offend Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>The other elders of the puppet sect also chimed in.</p><p>Lu Ming looked on coldly. It was said that the puppet sect intended to join Martial Emperor Di Yi. Now, it seemed to be true.</p><p>However, Bai Shijin and the elders of Fu sect did not say anything.</p><p>“Haha, Meng Chong, I think you’re overthinking it. I’m not here to join you. I’m here for brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>The rest of the people turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with curiosity. They were curious as to why such a young man could cause a war in ninedragons, and why even Martial Emperor Di Yi had to fight in person.</p><p>“He’s Lu Ming. It’s said that the battle of ninedragons was because of him. You want us to protect him, don’t you? How could he offend Martial Emperor Di Yi because of him? Yan kuangtu, I advise you to leave quickly. There is no room for discussion!”</p><p>Meng Chong said.</p><p>“Who said that Lu Ming is here to join the talisman Amulet sect? He’s here to take charge of the talisman Amulet sect. ”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said with a smile.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The patriarchs of the talisman Amulet sect were stunned. They looked at Yan kuangtu and Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>hahaha, Yan kuangtu, I think you’re crazy. You were beaten silly by Martial Emperor Di Yi in ninedragons. You can’t stay in ninedragons anymore, so you came to my Talisman Amulet sect to talk nonsense. He, a young boy, is in charge of the talisman Amulet sect? What a joke, what a joke.”</p><p>After a while, Meng Chong laughed crazily.</p><p>The others also looked at Yan kuangtu as if he was a madman.</p><p>Yan kuangtu pursed his lips and took out his wine gourd. He took a sip of wine and said, ” “If Lu Ming is senior Lian Cang’s inheritor and is entrusted by senior Lian Cang to take charge of the talisman Amulet sect, I wonder if it will be possible?”</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The hall fell silent again, so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard.</p><p>nonsense. Grandmaster Liao Cang has disappeared for three thousand years. How could he have inherited his legacy? ”</p><p>It was still Meng Chong who spoke.</p><p>Du songjue’s eyes gleamed as he looked at the expressionless Bai Shijin.</p><p>“I wonder if this can prove it?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and the all array diagram appeared in his hands.</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone’s eyes were focused on the all formation illustration.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Then, there were gasps of shock.</p><p>it’s the 10000 formation chart! Oh my God, it’s back!</p><p>the all formation illustration is the divine weapon of the sect master Lian Cang. It is also the token of the sect master. Without the sect master’s personal teaching, no one else can control it. Is he really the inheritor of the sect master? ”</p><p>In the hall, a burst of exclamations came.</p><p>Silver light flickered on the foreheads of the Grand elders as their Spirit Fire flickered. Their spirit energy was like a Spirit Storm that filled the hall and formed a powerful pressure.</p><p>“Boy, where did you get the all formation diagram? Hurry up and hand it over!”</p><p>Meng Chong suddenly stood up. A terrifying pressure emanated from his glabella and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His eyes flickered with greed. If he could obtain the ten thousand array diagram, puppet sect would be able to command the entire Talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Up above, du songjue’s eyes were also shining. The mental energy fire between his brows was jumping. He was clearly extremely excited.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a step forward. A powerful aura surged out and enveloped Lu Ming’s body, resisting the pressure.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to disobey senior Lian Cang’s order and steal the all formation illustration?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>the million array diagram is a sacred object of the talisman Amulet sect. How can it be controlled by a young kid? hand over the million array diagram now and tell us about the situation of Grandmaster Liao Cang. Then, we will let you leave safely.</p><p>Meng Chong said coldly.</p><p>“What a joke! Meng Chong, do you believe that I will cripple you?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu let out a loud roar. His body was covered in golden Crow fire. His violent aura pressed down on Meng Chong, causing the atmosphere in the hall to rise.</p><p>Meng Chong’s expression changed drastically. His mental energy fire flickered, and in front of him, dense inscriptions suddenly spread out, forming a large inscription formation to resist Yan kuangtu’s pressure. At the same time, he shouted, Yan kuangtu, although your combat strength is strong, this is the talisman sect. If we fight, you will die without a doubt!</p><p>“Enough to kill you!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu shouted in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Meng Chong and the other members of the puppet sect looked solemn.</p><p>They thought of the battle in ninedragons.</p><p>In the battle of ninedragons, Yan kuangtu’s combat strength was unrivaled. He was actually able to fight against three great Supremes. His combat strength had reached a terrifying level. If they were to really fight him, they would have to pay a heavy price even if they could take him down.</p><p>“Haha, Meng Chong, brother fanatic, we are all old acquaintances. Why are we so tense? let’s sit down and talk slowly!”</p><p>At this moment, du songjue, who had been silent the entire time, laughed.</p><p>Meng Chong snorted and sat down again.</p><p>Yan kuangtu chuckled and retracted his aura.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He sighed in his heart.</p><p>He already knew that it would not be easy to control the talisman Amulet sect with just the ten thousand array diagram.</p><p>And this was with Yan kuangtu around. If he was alone, he believed that the talisman sect would definitely kill him and seize the million array diagram without any room for negotiation.</p><p>This was strength. Only with strength would there be room for negotiation.</p><p>Lu Ming has inherited Grandmaster Liao Cang’s legacy. This can’t be wrong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to control the all formation illustration.</p><p>Bai Shijin slowly opened his mouth.</p><p>“Mm, that’s true!”</p><p>The other elders of talisman sect also nodded.</p><p>“So what if this is the case? To let a young kid like him take charge of the talisman Amulet sect? Moreover, he has offended Martial Emperor Di Yi. If Martial Emperor Di Yi comes to find him, it will be a big disaster!”</p><p>Meng Chong coldly snorted.</p><p>“Hehe, Meng Chong, I know that your puppet sect wants to join Martial Emperor Di Yi’s side, but is Di Yi worth it? For example, my master, the nine suns Supreme, has made many contributions to Di Yi, but he still killed him. If you join him, you might end up the same way!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>The expressions of du songjue, Meng Chong, and the rest of the puppet sect changed, but they did not say anything.</p><p>“And let me tell you something. Didn’t you want to know why senior Lian Cang suddenly disappeared? He was killed by Di Yi, and only a wisp of his soul was left, which escaped underground!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s voice was like a storm that swept through the hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
