In the blink of an eye, more than twenty days had passed.</p><p>...</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming continued to use the origin stone to break through, raising his cultivation to the peak sixth level spiritual ocean realm in one fell swoop.</p><p>However, the earth will was still stuck at the peak of the lower tier of level two, unable to break into the upper tier of level two.</p><p>At this time, there were less than ten days left until the half-year agreement.</p><p>“Little Qing, fatty and the others have already come out from the tianqiong relic. I should also make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been communicating with Xie nianqing and the rest through voice transmission. Otherwise, Xie nianqing would be worried about Lu Ming’s safety and would not be able to cultivate in peace.</p><p>Knowing that they were safe, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were able to cultivate in tianqiong relic in peace.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming could cultivate in peace and wait for the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>Lu Ming packed his things and left the cave abode. He quickly flew out of the wild beast forest.</p><p>Thousands of miles away, on a mountain peak, Wang haoxian was standing against the wind. When she saw Lu Ming, she followed him obediently and flew out.</p><p>Not long after, they were out of the wild beast forest. Suddenly, their bodies felt lighter. Their speed increased, and they turned into two rainbow lights, flying toward the east.</p><p>Half a day later, they were close to the Dragon vein in the East. Lu Ming brought Wang haoxian and flew directly to the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how have you been?”</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the sea Cloud sect, Qiao Xuan stepped into the air and said with a smile.</p><p>haha, Qiao Xuan, congratulations on breaking through to the spirit ocean and becoming a powerful being of the spirit ocean!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Qiao Xuan and could tell that she had already broken through to the spiritual ocean tier. She was now at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“I did break through, but you should be even more unfathomable!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan smiled and looked at Wang haoxian, who was behind Lu Ming. Lu Ming, you have such a beautiful woman with you. Be careful, miss nianqing will be jealous if she sees you!</p><p>don’t worry, she’s just my servant. Why would Xiao Qing be jealous? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Wang haoxian, who was standing behind Lu Ming, gritted his teeth and felt hatred in his heart.</p><p>“Maidservant?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan was taken aback. She turned to Wang haoxian and said, ” “May I know elder sister’s name?”</p><p>Wang haoxian glanced at Qiao Xuan and snorted, but he didn’t answer.</p><p>How could a disciple from a small power like Qiao Xuan enter Wang haoxian’s eyes?</p><p>she is Wang haoxian!</p><p>Lu Ming answered on her behalf.</p><p>“So it’s Lady Wang. What? Wang haoxian? Which Wang haoxian?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan started to nod but she immediately reacted. Her pupils contracted and she looked at Lu Ming in shock, asking a few questions.</p><p>isn’t it Wang haoxian from the ancient Wang family? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“What? She was a God-level prodigy, Wang haoxian? She … She’s your … Your maidservant?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s voice trembled as she spoke, her eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Who would believe that Wang haoxian, a God-level prodigy, had become Lu Ming’s maidservant?</p><p>Qiao Xuan thought she was dreaming.</p><p>Wang haoxian gritted his teeth unhappily.</p><p>She knew that if this matter were to spread, her reputation would be tarnished, but what could she do? She was also helpless.</p><p>well, let’s not talk about this first. Little Qing and fatty should be here soon!</p><p>Lu Ming said casually, his gaze looking into the distance.</p><p>Qiao Xuan kept taking deep breaths to calm herself down.</p><p>This matter was simply too shocking.</p><p>Soon, two rainbow lights appeared from the horizon. In a few breaths, they arrived in front of the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>As the rainbow light dissipated, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin’s figures appeared.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, we meet again. I missed you so much!</p><p>As soon as Kong Jin appeared, he burst into laughter and pounced on Lu Ming like a bear. However, the next moment, he swept his gaze and saw Wang haoxian standing behind Lu Ming. He felt as if his butt had been pricked by a needle and his body bounced up like a round ball.</p><p>“Wang haoxian, is that you? What are you doing here?”</p><p>The fatty cried out in disbelief, and his aura burst out.</p><p>The peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>After not seeing each other for half a year, Fatty’s cultivation had reached the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, only one step away from the sixth level.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing’s cultivation at the peak fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm erupted. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang haoxian.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you want to fight? Do you think you’re my match?”</p><p>Wang haoxian laughed coldly. A powerful aura burst out and pressed down on fatty and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“What are you doing? Retract your aura!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Wang haoxian and snorted.</p><p>Wang haoxian snorted and retracted his aura. He stood obediently behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Fatty and Xie nianqing were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Don’t be nervous, she’s my maidservant now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Ya … A maidservant?”</p><p>Fatty’s mouth was as wide as a lamb leg, while Xie nianqing’s eyes were wide open.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not mention that Wang haoxian had become his servant through voice transmission. The Jade talisman could not explain clearly, but he said that he was fine and that they did not have to worry.</p><p>Therefore, Xie nianqing and the others were naturally shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming explained how he subdued and toyed with Wang haoxian, but he skipped the part about the nine yang Supreme. He only said that he had accidentally found the dark Yin grass and refined it into dark Yin powder, then controlled Wang haoxian.</p><p>“It’s actually like this? Lu Ming, I really admire you. It’s so cool to have such a beautiful woman serving you every day! No, I also want to learn the Dao of inscription, I also want to learn!”</p><p>The fatty was the first to shout, his two little eyes were full of stars.</p><p>It was as if he could already see countless proud girls surrounding him, serving him, and becoming his maidservants.</p><p>fatty, don’t talk nonsense. I’ve been cultivating alone all this time!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly explained.</p><p>“Lu Ming, both of you will be in the wild beast forest during this period of time!”</p><p>A cold voice came.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes swept between Lu Ming and Wang haoxian with hostility.</p><p>“Little Qing, although we’re both in the wild beast forest, we’re all cultivating on our own.” Lu Ming quickly explained.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, the bed is ready. Do you need me to help you warm it up?”</p><p>At this moment, Wang haoxian spoke. Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched. He turned around and glared at Wang haoxian. Wang haoxian’s lips curled up slightly and he looked smug.</p><p>nest, this is revenge, pure revenge!</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in his heart.</p><p>As expected, Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and his eyes widened. With a cold expression, he squeezed out a sentence, ” “Pervert, Lu Ming, you’re indeed a perverted man!”</p><p>“I, I’m innocent!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. What did he mean by ‘perverted’? When was he lecherous?</p><p>“Wang haoxian, don’t talk nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Wang haoxian immediately put on an aggrieved expression. He pinched his fingers and lowered his head, pretending to be obedient and not say a word.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
