So, he was Lu Ming?</p><p>...</p><p>Bai chixue could not help but remember that she used to praise Lu Ming in front of him and said that if she wanted to find someone she liked, she would find someone like Lu Ming.</p><p>Wasn’t he saying this in front of Lu Ming?</p><p>Thinking of this, Bai chixue’s face turned red and she felt very embarrassed.</p><p>“This bad guy, he didn’t tell me!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face was as red as an Apple.</p><p>In the talisman Amulet sect, the other young people also looked at Lu Ming in shock. Then, they came to a realization.</p><p>It turned out that tianyun was Lu Ming.</p><p>No wonder he was so talented and powerful!</p><p>He was the one who started the war in ninedragons, pulled out the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, fought against the Supreme martial artists, and finally caused Di Yi and Martial Emperor to attack?</p><p>No wonder!</p><p>In that case, everything made sense. Since Lu Ming was tianyun, it made sense that he had crushed everyone in the talisman sect’s competition and won the first place.</p><p>It was because he was Lu Ming!</p><p>“Little bastard, I’m going to kill you now!”</p><p>Flames danced on Wang Shengtian’s body, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>However, he was severely suppressed and only had the aura of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Wang Shengtian, this is not ninedragons!”</p><p>Bai Shi took a step forward and stood in front of Wang Shengtian, spiritual power spreading out from between his eyebrows.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, your Talisman Amulet sect dares to oppose my Emperor heaven divine Palace? Are you looking to die?”</p><p>Wang Shengtian shouted with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Hehe, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace has always been annexing the territory of my Talisman Amulet sect. Haven’t they always been at odds with us?”</p><p>Bai Shijin sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Wang Shengtian’s face turned ugly.</p><p>If they were outside, he would have made a move immediately. The Emperor heaven divine Palace had more Supremes than the talisman Amulet sect. They were more than enough to defeat the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>However, in this place, he couldn’t display the strength of a Supreme martial artist at all. An ordinary elder of the talisman sect would probably be able to stop him. If they were to fight, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace might suffer a great loss.</p><p>Hmph, good, very good. Talisman Amulet sect, let’s see how many of you can survive this battle of Providence!</p><p>Wang Shengtian coldly spoke. After that, he instructed the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, everyone from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, listen up. In the battle of Providence, if you encounter anyone from the talisman Amulet sect, there’s no need to show mercy. Kill them!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace replied loudly, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>also, especially Lu Ming. If you see him, kill him without mercy. I’ll reward whoever kills him!</p><p>Wang Shengtian said.</p><p>“I must kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>yes, ” the sovereign of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace replied. His cold killing intent spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of the powerful heaven’s favorites had cold and unfathomable gazes.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the direction of the sky demon Valley.</p><p>A brawny man in red armor was looking at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“That’s the sovereign of the flood Dragon Tribe!”</p><p>Someone recognized the brawny man.</p><p>My nephew aokun was killed by you. Good, very good!</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign turned to look at the geniuses of the sky demon Valley and shouted, this kid killed my nephew. If you see him in the battle of Providence, kill him without mercy. Whoever kills him will be heavily rewarded!</p><p>“Haha, he’s mine!”</p><p>“I will kill him!”</p><p>Instantly, the paragons of the sky demon Valley looked at Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>The battle of Providence had yet to begin, but the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley had already targeted Lu Ming. They wanted to kill him.</p><p>Everyone in the heavenly corpse sect was waiting to watch a good show.</p><p>Bai chixue, ruan Tingting, fatty and the rest looked at Lu Ming with worry.</p><p>The faces of Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were solemn.</p><p>They did not expect that things would turn out this way. Lu Ming would have a hard time in this battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were calm. He remembered that he had killed a legendary dragon, ao kun, at the exchange of the three forces in ninedragons.</p><p>His eyes swept across the people of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the sky demon Valley. He then said,”Since you want to kill me, then you should be prepared to be killed by me!”</p><p>His voice was also very calm, but it revealed a strong self-confidence and a sharp killing intent.</p><p>“What a big mouth, Who Do You Think You Are? How dare you say you’ll kill us!”</p><p>In the Emperor heaven divine Palace, a young man sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. He recognized this person.</p><p>Jiang Taichong was the person who had stopped him when he emerged victorious in the Heavenly King ranking battle.</p><p>This man was ranked in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“They’re just clowns!”</p><p>Another voice rang out from the crowd of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. After that, a young man walked out while pulling a woman along.</p><p>“Wang Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming also recognized that Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong had stopped them after the battle on the Heavenly King ranking.</p><p>At that time, the two of them were high and mighty, looking down on Lu Ming and the rest. They said that the battle of the Heavenly Kings ranking was just a game for children and they did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>At this moment, they did not take Lu Ming seriously.</p><p>“Wang haoxian!”</p><p>What made Lu Ming’s eyes light up was that the person Wang Yan was holding onto was Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face was pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when you were in ninedragons, Wang haoxian, that b * tch, seemed to be very close to you. That b * tch dared to betray the Wang family. Although he has been punished, it’s not enough. Do you see this?” he said.</p><p>Wang Yan pointed at the collar on Wang haoxian’s neck and said to Lu Ming.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He did not say anything.</p><p>this collar can explode at any time. When that happens, this b * tch will be crushed to pieces. This time, in the battle of Providence, I’ll crush this b * tch to pieces in front of you!</p><p>Wang Yan said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent and he said coldly, ” “Wang Yan, I will definitely kill you in the battle of Providence!”</p><p>haha, you’re indeed an adulterous couple. You’re trying to kill me. There’s no need to wait until the battle of Providence. Lu Ming, I’ll make sure you won’t be able to enter the battle of Providence!</p><p>Wang Yan sneered.</p><p>For a moment, the atmosphere of the scene became very heavy.</p><p>“The road is about to open!”</p><p>At this moment, someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned to the abyss.</p><p>If one wanted to enter the door of light on the other side of the abyss and participate in the war of Providence, they had to cross the abyss.</p><p>However, the abyss had a terrifying attractive force, making it impossible to fly. If anyone tried to fly, they would definitely fall into the abyss and die on the spot.</p><p>He could only wait for the road to pass and step forward.</p><p>At this moment, everyone could see that in front of the abyss, there were many floating stone platforms flying over.</p><p>The round stone platforms were about one meter in diameter and were separated from each other. They were suspended above the abyss and extended to the other side, forming many paths.</p><p>They were going to fly from these round platforms to the other side.</p><p>Very quickly, the path was formed. The sky above the abyss was filled with round platforms.</p><p>“We only have the time for an incense stick to burn. After that, the round platform will collapse and the road will be over!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>The start of every battle for Providence was similar, but the world behind the door of light was different every time.</p><p>The four forces didn’t move for a while.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you along the way!”</p><p>Wang Yan licked his lips, his killing intent overflowing.</p><p>Many powerful paragons also looked at Lu Ming coldly. They also had the intention to kill Lu Ming on this path.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
