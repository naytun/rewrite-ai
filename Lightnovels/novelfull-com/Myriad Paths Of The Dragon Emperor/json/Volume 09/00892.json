He was fully focused on the meditation of the underworld. He could feel that there was a continuous influx of rich power of inscription from the top of his head, which was transformed into mental fire. The mental fire in his sea of consciousness was constantly strengthened.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming had already lit up five Blue Spirit lamps. The fifth one had already reached its peak and the flames were intense.</p><p>Now, not long after, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire became more and more exuberant. Then, the sixth mental energy lamp emitted a small blue flame.</p><p>The sixth Blue Lamp of spirit was lit.</p><p>It was too fast to cultivate on the observatory. It only took a few hours, which was comparable to Lu Ming’s half a month of hard work.</p><p>The training continued.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his mental energy fire was growing stronger.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and the five of them were all immersed in cultivation.</p><p>They were not the only ones. In the entire Eastern barren territory, or even the entire divine wilderness continent, all the young geniuses and elites were immersed in their cultivation.</p><p>The battle of Providence was getting closer and closer, and everyone was doing their best to improve their strength.</p><p>All the major forces had also opened up their resources, and everyone was improving rapidly.</p><p>Especially those heaven’s favorites at the top, their improvement is even more shocking.</p><p>The strong would become stronger!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month’s time had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and ended his cultivation.</p><p>The other four also stopped their cultivation and opened their eyes.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were filled with surprise and satisfaction. It was obvious that they had all made great progress in the past month.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind flickered and he realized that nine Blue Spirit lamps were burning in his sea of consciousness. His mental energy was surging and exuberant.</p><p>In a month’s time, he had lit up four spirit lamps. It was truly shocking.</p><p>After all, it was extremely difficult to light up six lamps at each level.</p><p>He didn’t know what kind of results Ji mai and the others had obtained, they must have gained a lot.</p><p>At this moment, a strong tearing force pulled the five of them. In an instant, their bodies disappeared, and the platform they were sitting on disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of light, he found himself back on the altar.</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others stood around him.</p><p>alright, a month has passed. I’m sure you’ve all gained a lot. Go back and digest it!</p><p>Bai Shijin laughed.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and the rest bade farewell to Bai Shijin and the rest and returned to their respective places.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the cloud Peak House and found Bai chixue inscribing inscription scrolls in the yard.</p><p>After a while, Bai chixue was done and found Lu Ming.</p><p>“How is it? The trip to the observatory must have been a great harvest!”</p><p>Bai chixue showed a bit of envy.</p><p>Which talisman sect disciple wouldn’t be envious of entering the observatory.</p><p>it’s alright. Do you have any questions about your cultivation during this period of time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, master has been very busy recently and has no time to guide me. I can only rely on you!”</p><p>Bai chixue chuckled and told him all her doubts.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and shared his understanding. The two of them started to discuss.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming returned to his room and started to think about the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>There were only three months left until the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>Now, his Dao of inscription had reached a sufficiently high level. It would be difficult to make a big improvement in a short period of time. Lu Ming had to spend all his time and effort on martial arts.</p><p>I need to find a place with many demonic beasts. I can hunt demonic beasts and devour their blood essence to improve my bloodline. I can also borrow the strength of the demonic beasts to temper my intent and comprehend my martial arts!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>After that, he took out a portion of demonic beast blood essence and began to devour and refine it.</p><p>He hadn’t even refined the blood essence he had bought last time.</p><p>This time, he used all of it to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>After awakening the nine dragon claws, the amount of blood essence required was shockingly high.</p><p>After refining 50 sets of seventh grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence and 50 sets of eighth grade sixth level demonic beast blood essence, the nine Dragon bloodline had only advanced by one level, reaching tier two of the divine level.</p><p>As his nine Dragon bloodline advanced, another dragon power was born in his bloodline. There were two Dragon powers in total.</p><p>Three days had passed.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming walked out of his room and asked Bai chixue if there was a suitable place to cultivate.</p><p>Bai chixue thought for a while and found a suitable place.</p><p>The feral secret realm!</p><p>This was a secret realm controlled by the talisman sect. It could be considered a medium-sized dimension. There were primitive forests everywhere, and countless demonic beasts were nurtured.</p><p>These demonic beasts were very primitive. They might have never come into contact with humans, so they could not speak human language or take human form. They maintained their most primitive beast form.</p><p>This was undoubtedly very suitable for Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Bai chixue and headed to the entrance of the secret realm of beasts.</p><p>There were many people at the entrance. Many talisman sect disciples and even the older generation entered to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>After all, an inscriber needed all kinds of materials. In the ferocious beast secret realm, killing demonic beasts not only gave them materials, but also blood essence, which was wealth.</p><p>sky cloud! It’s sky cloud zongzi!</p><p>“Sky cloud zongzi!”</p><p>Many people hurriedly greeted Lu Ming when he arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s status, it was naturally easy for him to enter the ferocious beasts ‘secret realm.</p><p>Endless mountains and forests came into view.</p><p>The roars of demonic beasts came from the distance. It was a scene of wilderness.</p><p>haha, this is a good place. It’s very primitive and should be a Mystic realm that has just been developed. I can smell the fragrance of countless spiritual herbs!</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder, her head constricting and her small eyes glowing.</p><p>In all directions, people continued to fly forward and enter the wild mountains.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and flew towards the savage Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He flew deeper and deeper. According to Bai chixue, the ferocious beasts secret realm was indeed a secret realm that the talisman sect had discovered not long ago. It had not been ten years and its development was limited.</p><p>The deeper one went, the stronger the demonic beasts would be.</p><p>There were even quite a few existences at the spirit embryo realm and above in the depths.</p><p>Before long, Lu Ming was a million miles deep.</p><p>He could already see other people’s figures.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A seven to eight-meter tall, thirty-meter long giant lizard rushed out of the forest and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The air was filled with ferocity, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>The peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a long spear formed in his palm. With a swing, the long spear shot out like lightning. Four concepts of heaven and earth swirled around it.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the giant lizard’s head, leaving a bowl-sized bloody hole.</p><p>The giant lizard roared and its huge body smashed into the forest, crushing a large area of ancient trees.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. It opened its mouth and aimed at the giant lizard. A terrifying devouring power erupted.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
