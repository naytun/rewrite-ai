Giant wolves, fierce Tigers, Eagles, and other demonic beasts flew out and howled at the sky.</p><p>On the upper left corner, the number representing the number of formations began to soar.</p><p>In the beginning, it was forty-three.</p><p>In an instant, it rose to 75.</p><p>In a single breath, the number had soared to seventy-five.</p><p>However, this was not the end. Lu Ming waved his fingers and the sky was filled with finger shadows. At a terrifying speed, he continuously pointed.</p><p>The number continued to rise.</p><p>Five breaths. In just five breaths, that number had soared to ninety-nine.</p><p>He found all of them. Within five breaths, Lu Ming had pointed out all the formations.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Countless people’s eyes were wide open. Their mouths were as wide as half of their faces. They all had the same expression as they looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Silence! The entire place was silent, not a single sound was made.</p><p>This was too terrifying. He had found all the formations in five breaths.</p><p>This had never happened before.</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s beautiful eyes were filled with excitement as she looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, Meng Jia, and the others were also shocked.</p><p>“Your drawing, is it very difficult?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted back to the rising sun as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>These words were like a series of slaps on Sunrise’s face, causing his face to flush red as if it was about to bleed.</p><p>His eyes were bloodshot and his body was trembling violently. He was still in shock.</p><p>He had just said that Lu Ming’s picture was simple and he was just lucky.</p><p>But now?</p><p>He had pondered hard for a long time and only found forty-three of the pictures that he had chosen. He had also said earlier that his pictures would definitely be more difficult than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>The most ironic thing was that he could not find a picture after racking his brains. He said that it was more difficult than Lu Ming’s, but Lu Ming found it with a wave of his hand in less than five breaths.</p><p>Could there be anything more ironic than this?</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, he was simply blind and useless.</p><p>He wished he could find a hole to hide in.</p><p>“Tianyun, don’t be too pleased with yourself. Identifying formations is just a test of one’s eye of discernment. You’ve only read a few more books on formations and inscriptions, and that’s all. However, in the Dao of inscription, not only will knowledge be useful, it will also require application. If you can’t use it, you’re just a nerd!”</p><p>Sunrise growled.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming’s Dao of refinement was that impressive. Like some people, he thought that Lu Ming had only seen more inscription arrays.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and turned to leave. He could not be bothered with the rising sun.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin stroked his beard and laughed.</p><p>Bai Shijin, don’t be happy too early. He has received the inheritance of our master and has mastered the inscription formations. It’s only natural that he can recognize all the formations in the pictures. The main thing is to look at the back!</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>“That’s true!” Bai Shijin nodded.</p><p>They were conversing through voice transmission, so no one else could hear them.</p><p>alright, half an hour hasn’t passed yet. If you want to continue searching, then quickly continue!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and the others perked up and continued their search.</p><p>Very quickly, half an hour had passed.</p><p>Everyone’s results were already out.</p><p>More than 3000 people had participated, and more than half of them had been eliminated. Only 1500 people had passed the first round.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming’s results were first.</p><p>The second place was Ji mai. He found 67 formations.</p><p>The third place was a young man named H Ming, who had found 65 formations.</p><p>Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia were tied at fourth place, having found 62 formations.</p><p>The other God-tier heaven’s favorites all had less than sixty and more than forty.</p><p>Bai chixue’s result was unexpectedly good. She actually found 45, two more than the rising sun.</p><p>The first round of the competition had officially ended.</p><p>now, let’s begin the second round, the all formation tower!</p><p>Meng Chong’s voice resounded through the entire area.</p><p>Everyone looked to the East of the White jade square. There was a Pagoda there. It was thousands of meters tall and reached into the clouds. It occupied a vast area.</p><p>This was the all formations Pagoda.</p><p>Meng Chong walked in the air and arrived near the thousand formation tower first.</p><p>I believe most of you know that the thousand formations Pagoda is divided into thirty-six levels. There are many great formations inside, and they change endlessly. The power will be different according to the difficulty of the choice.</p><p>the formations at the bottom are relatively simple. The higher you go, the more difficult it is. Only by breaking those formations can you get to the next level. The second round of the competition will be held in the thousand formations Pagoda. The difficulty level is medium. Only those who can pass the twelfth level will pass and enter the next round!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>“What? The intermediate difficulty required one to pass all twelve levels? Such high requirements.”</p><p>I’m done for. I just passed the all formations Pagoda not long ago. I can only reach level nine.</p><p>I can only make it to the tenth level. It’s over. I’m most likely going to be eliminated!</p><p>As soon as Meng Chong’s words fell, the surrounding people sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. He had seen this all formations Pagoda on the map that Bai chixue had given him. It was a place for Talisman Amulet sect disciples to cultivate. Lu Ming had not been here before!</p><p>Some people sighed, while others had calm eyes, clearly knowing what was going on.</p><p>That was because most of them had come to pass the all formations tower, and there was a rough estimate of how many levels they could pass.</p><p>alright, there are a total of 1516 people who have passed the first round. Each time, 500 people will enter. Now, let’s begin!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Suddenly, many figures rushed towards the thousand formations Pagoda. From the bottom of the thousand formations Pagoda, a door of light entered and disappeared.</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and H Ming, the four of them went in at the same time!</p><p>this is going to be a good show. This H Ming is a Dark Horse. I wonder how many levels the four of them can reach? ”</p><p>Around them, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also watching with great interest.</p><p>“How does the all formations tower look at results? How do we know who has passed and how many levels?”</p><p>At that moment, Bai chixue had walked to Lu Ming’s side. Lu Ming asked Bai chixue about it.</p><p>did you see that? there’s a huge Jade tablet beside the thousand formations Pagoda. As long as someone enters, their name will be displayed on it. Behind the name, it will show the level they have reached.</p><p>also, this thousand formations Pagoda is absolutely fair. Everyone who goes in will face the same formation.</p><p>Bai chixue explained.</p><p>Lu Ming looked to the side. Indeed, there was a Jade tablet there with names appearing on it.</p><p>There were five hundred of them.</p><p>At this moment, behind the 500 names, there was a ‘one’.</p><p>It was obvious that everyone was on the first floor.</p><p>However, Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and H Ming’s names were quickly replaced by the word ‘two’.</p><p>The changes happened almost at the same time. This meant that the four of them had entered the second level at the same time.</p><p>But not long after, the four of their names became ‘three’ again.</p><p>Only then did the other heaven’s favorites make it to the second level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
