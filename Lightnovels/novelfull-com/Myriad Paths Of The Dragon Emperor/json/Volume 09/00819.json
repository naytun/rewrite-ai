He hoped that ruan Tingting would be killed in the brutal competition. At the same time, he was also making preparations.</p><p>He had paid a huge price to hire a sixth rank true inscription Alchemist to inscribe an extremely powerful killing formation in the wind sword sect. As long as ruan Tingting and Lu Ming stepped into the wind sword sect, he would activate the killing formation and kill them.</p><p>little b * tch, I’ve already given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Even a sixth level spiritual ocean tier martial artist will die if he steps into this array. Now, let’s see how you’re going to kill me.</p><p>Ye FA’s face was extremely gloomy as he spoke coldly.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s brows twitched as she cursed in her heart. She had been too careless.</p><p>hehe, sect leader ye, you think you can kill us with this formation? you’re too naive.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Hmph, it’s more than enough to kill you!”</p><p>Ye fa said coldly. However, his eyes flashed with a serious look.</p><p>In reality, the one he feared the most was not ruan Tingting, but Lu Ming and the rest. In his eyes, Lu Ming and the rest were unfathomable. More than half a year ago, in that competition, the wind sword sect had been completely defeated by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>He had built this large array mainly to deal with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>you think too highly of your array. To be honest, I don’t know what kind of inscriber you’ve hired. They’re complete trash. You want to trap us with a trash array? you’re too naive!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>With every step that Lu Ming took, a circle of dense inscriptions would appear on the ground. These inscriptions seemed to be alive and were actually moving on the ground.</p><p>Ye FA’s expression changed drastically, and he shouted, ” “You’re also an inscription master? Take control of the formation and kill them!”</p><p>The formation around them shook. In the sky, endless sword Qi gathered, exuding a terrifying power as it shot toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Xie nianqing, fatty, ruan Tingting, and even Wang haoxian didn’t move at all, as if they didn’t see the sword Qi.</p><p>They had all seen how strong Lu Mingming’s refinement path was.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had a smile on his face. He took a step forward and said softly,”Break!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sword Qi that was stabbing at them from all directions collapsed.</p><p>Puchi …</p><p>The inscriptions around the wind sword sect were like fire falling into ice. With a sizzling sound, they disappeared without a trace.</p><p>As Lu Ming finished speaking, the large array was broken!</p><p>Ye fa, Ye Qing, and some of the wind sword sect elders ‘faces paled. They turned pale and bloodless.</p><p>Ye fa had paid a huge price to hire a sixth rank true inscription Alchemist and spent half a month to perfect the formation that could kill a sixth level spiritual ocean tier expert. To think that it was broken by Lu Ming while he was talking and laughing.</p><p>This was too shocking. Could it be that not only was Lu Ming’s martial arts cultivation so powerful, but his Dao of inscription was also so terrifying that all his plans were useless in an instant?</p><p>They felt a chill in their hearts and were in despair.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, didn’t you want to take revenge? If you want to take revenge, then do it yourself. Why did you call for help? since that’s the case, I admit defeat today. If you want to kill me, then kill me!”</p><p>Ye fa called out to ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Ye fa, you don’t have to use such a low level method to provoke me. If it was a direct battle, I wouldn’t interfere. But if you use such a method, I will definitely interfere!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“You won’t interfere? You said it, don’t go back on your word!”</p><p>Ye fa shouted.</p><p>“Naturally, I won’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, what about you?”</p><p>Ye fa was still worried and looked at ruan Tingting.</p><p>“I will kill you all with my own hands!” Ruan Tingting’s answer was very obvious.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, let’s attack and kill this little b * tch!”</p><p>Ye fa gritted his teeth and said in a dark voice.</p><p>Suddenly, two old men rushed out from behind ye fa, and their powerful auras filled the air.</p><p>“Fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan exclaimed.</p><p>These two old men were actually at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. The wind sword sect definitely did not have such powerful experts. Ye fa must have paid a huge price to invite them.</p><p>What ye fa said just now was to get Lu Ming and the rest to not make a move. Then, he would let two experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier kill ruan Tingting. His intentions were vicious.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Tingting, she …”</p><p>Qiao Xuan looked at Lu Ming worriedly.</p><p>“No problem, Tingting should be able to handle it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had long noticed that there were two experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier behind ye fa, but he trusted ruan Tingting.</p><p>Ruan Tingting had received supremacy Lan Jin’s inheritance, which was a God-grade cultivation technique. In addition, ruan Tingting’s talent was unparalleled. In the past, it was only buried in the wind sword sect. Otherwise, she would not have received supremacy Lan Jin’s inheritance.</p><p>With a divine-grade cultivation technique as a Foundation, it wouldn’t be a big problem for him to cross two levels and deal with two ordinary fifth level spiritual ocean tier cultivators after cultivating in the Emperor heaven royal guards for so long.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword radiance whistled, and The Blue Sword Qi soared into the sky as if it could tear everything apart.</p><p>sword concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Ruan Tingting had evolved the mentality of sword from the mentality of metal.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shouted and stepped forward. Her sword Qi whistled as she charged towards the two elders.</p><p>The two old men used all their strength, but after a few moves, they began to be at a disadvantage.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s Blue sword light was condensed from a God-tier cultivation technique, and with the sword intent, it was simply invincible.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi tore through the two old men’s attack and defense.</p><p>“Spare me!”</p><p>The two old men wanted to beg for mercy, but the sword Qi pierced through the void and pierced through their throats. The two old men were dead!</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Ye fa, Ye Qing, and the others turned pale and despaired.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes were filled with killing intent as she stepped forward. Her sword Qi shot into the sky as she walked towards ye fa.</p><p>Tingting, Tingting, please spare us. I treated you well back then!</p><p>Ye fa screamed and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>“You’re treating me well? Marrying me to the two monsters of Qing He in exchange for your children’s opportunities, is this treating me well? You used my parents to force me and caused them to die in the end. Is this how you treat me?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting sneered.</p><p>that was just a moment of confusion. Tingting, if you kill me, the wind sword sect will no longer exist. It will fall apart and be erased from the world!</p><p>Ye fa did not give up and continued to shout.</p><p>“What does the wind sword sect’s non-existence have to do with me?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting remained unmoved and strode forward. Her sword Qi whistled out and pierced forward.</p><p>A few wind sword sect elders shouted in anger as they unleashed their full strength in an attempt to block the attack. However, it was all in vain as the sword Qi pierced through their foreheads.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The other higher-ups of the sub-sword sect ran for their lives.</p><p>However, the sword Qi pierced through the air and killed those people one by one.</p><p>In the end, only ye fa and Ye Qing were left.</p><p>The two of them trembled, their faces pale.</p><p>They were in despair. Back then, they had forced ruan Tingting into a corner, but they never expected this to happen.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ye fa and Ye Qing could not resist the sword light at all. The two figures fell to the ground.</p><p>The upper echelons of the wind sword sect had all been annihilated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
