Why?</p><p>...</p><p>Why did it suddenly move? Countless people speculated in shock.</p><p>There were even many people who had already passed the news back to the elders in their families.</p><p>“Is it because of the nine Dragon bloodline? The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron moves because of the bloodline of the nine Dragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’re leaving this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He estimated that there would be a Big Shot coming soon to check on the situation.</p><p>After all, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which had remained motionless for ages, suddenly moved. It was too abnormal.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, a tall figure appeared behind Lu Ming and blocked his way.</p><p>It was the monster flood Dragon.</p><p>“Your Excellency, why are you blocking my way?” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The flood Dragon exuded a powerful aura. It glared at Lu Ming with a look of surprise and greed.</p><p>“Your bloodline is very special. If you let me strip you of your bloodline, I can spare your life!”</p><p>The flood Dragon said coldly in an overbearing manner. Its greed grew even stronger. It seemed to have sensed the abnormality of the nine Dragon bloodline in Lu Ming.</p><p>“WOWO, is there something wrong with this reptile’s brain? Who does he think he is to want to take away someone’s bloodline?”</p><p>The fatty was instantly enraged when he heard that. He glared at the flood Dragon with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>demon race insect, how dare you be so arrogant here! This is ninedragons!</p><p>Ruan Tingting also said coldly.</p><p>how dare you insult me? you’re courting death!</p><p>die! the flood Dragon shouted coldly, a cold light in its eyes.</p><p>nest, this stinky bug is still so arrogant. I suggest that we behead him and roast him!</p><p>The fatty shouted and even swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The flood Dragon roared and threw a punch at fatty.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>Fatty rushed forward with his battle axe and swung it down.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The flood Dragon’s fist hit the Fatty’s battle-ax with a loud bang. The Fatty’s expression changed, and his fat trembled violently. He retreated seven or eight steps and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The flood Dragon’s level had reached the peak of the sixth level, equivalent to the peak of the sixth level spiritual ocean realm, while the fatty was only at the fifth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>“None of you will leave today!”</p><p>The flood dragon’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>this flood dragon’s bloodline purity has already reached 20%. It’s extremely powerful!</p><p>Wang haoxian appeared beside Lu Ming and said.</p><p>A demon beast possessed the bloodline of a divine beast. Depending on the purity of the bloodline, their talent and strength would be different as well.</p><p>Ordinary descendants were said to contain the bloodline of a divine beast, but the very thin ones might only have one percent or one tenth of it.</p><p>It was extremely rare to reach one-tenth, which was ten percent purity. Such descendants were extremely powerful and could even compete with God-level geniuses who had awakened a God-level bloodline.</p><p>The flood Dragon in front of him had the bloodline of a true dragon, and it had already reached 20%, which was even more terrifying.</p><p>However, the flood Dragon that Lu Ming had encountered on the Golden sand island in the chaotic Astral Ocean only contained one-tenth of the true dragon’s bloodline at most.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The flood Dragon strode toward Lu Ming.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing and Wang haoxian were about to make their moves.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flood Dragon was very domineering as it threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Since you don’t want to hand it over, I’ll take it myself!”</p><p>The flood Dragon’s lips curled into a sinister sneer.</p><p>A murderous intent flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes.”Fatty, let’s have flood dragon meat tonight!”</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The palm and the flood Dragon’s fist collided.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a muffled boom in the air. The flood Dragon’s expression changed drastically, and its body trembled as it retreated.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and covered a hundred meters in an instant. He caught up with the flood Dragon and struck out with his palm again.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon roared and transformed into a 200-meter long crimson flood Dragon. It was covered in thick scales and its claws were as sharp as knives. It tore at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm again, clashing with the flood dragon’s claw. The flood Dragon roared and its huge body retreated madly. One of its fingerbone was broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>This wyrmdragon had twenty percent of the true dragon’s bloodline, which was about the same level as GUI Yue. Naturally, it was completely crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and grabbed one of the flood dragon’s claws. With a loud shout, he flung the huge flood Dragon’s body into the air and it crashed heavily onto the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground shook violently. However, the ground here had been suppressed by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron all year round and was already indestructible. The huge flood Dragon’s body smashed down, but the ground only shook, not cracked at all.</p><p>A series of crackling sounds rang out, and the flood Dragon cried out in pain. It was unknown how many bones had been broken, and blood was flowing all over its body.</p><p>Nearby, the others who were watching were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was too violent. Such a powerful wyrmdragon was like a useless worm in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>haha, let me do it. Let’s have flood dragon meat tonight!</p><p>The fatty shouted as he raised his battle-ax and hacked at the flood Dragon.</p><p>The flood Dragon roared and struggled. The moment the fatty slashed down, its body continued to shrink. At the same time, its body was filled with a bloody light, like a blood-colored flame burning.</p><p>However, he was still a step too slow. As blood splattered in all directions, one of his legs was cut off by the fatty.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the Water Dragon turned into a ray of blood light and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to give it to the fatty, but the moment he relaxed, the flood Dragon ran away.</p><p>he actually burned the divine beast bloodline in his body. Even if he doesn’t die, his future will be cut off!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The flood Dragon had burned the divine beast bloodline in its body to increase its speed. Of course, this was also the reason why Lu Ming had let his guard down. Otherwise, the flood Dragon would not have been able to escape even if it had burned its divine beast bloodline.</p><p>“Nest, it actually ran away. Fortunately, it left a leg behind!”</p><p>The fat man cried out gloomily and ran towards a flood Dragon’s leg that was dozens of meters long.</p><p>haha, let’s go back and roast some flood dragon meat!</p><p>Fatty held onto the flood Dragon’s leg and carried it on his shoulder. He laughed so hard that he almost drooled.</p><p>Nearby, the others were speechless. This group of people couldn’t really be planning to roast the flood Dragon’s leg, right?</p><p>Many people even swallowed their saliva. The flood dragon meat that contained the bloodline of a true dragon was a great supplement.</p><p>“Fatty, let’s go back and roast some meat. But you should keep it first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Fatty put away the leg and the group left happily. They came to a small mountain peak hundreds of thousands of miles away and started a bonfire to roast the leg.</p><p>Fatty was a bone ash grade glutton, and his roasting skills were top-notch. Furthermore, he always carried sauce, vinegar, oil, salt, and other condiments in his storage ring.</p><p>Not long after, the Dragon’s leg turned golden yellow. Oil dripped down, and a fragrant smell assailed the nose.</p><p>The flood dragon meat was cut into pieces, and everyone began to eat.</p><p>Flood dragon meat contained the blood of a true dragon, so it was definitely a great tonic. The taste was also surprisingly good. Even Xie nianqing, ruan Tingting, and the other girls had a great appetite.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
