It can actually exert a trace of the power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to block my palm.</p><p>At this time, the voice in the sky, an extremely majestic voice, rang out again.</p><p>“However, a mere spiritual ocean tier cultivator, no matter how profound his bloodline is, how much of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s power can he unleash? How can you really stop me? Break!”</p><p>As the last word ‘break’ was uttered, the palm shook slightly, and a palm force several times stronger than before suddenly exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the entire world seemed to be shaking. The sky and the earth within hundreds of thousands of miles seemed to be shaking.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was the first to bear the brunt, and it let out a violent roar.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons wrapped around the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron wailed and turned into a ray of blood-red light, rushing into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently, as if it was about to explode.</p><p>At that moment, lightning appeared between Lu Ming’s brows. The lightning cauldron coursed through Lu Ming’s body to prevent him from being crushed to pieces.</p><p>It was the lightning cauldron in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>In the sky, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron trembled. Then, it split into nine and turned back into nine lightning cauldrons. At this time, without the bloodline of the nine Dragons and under the powerful and terrifying attack, the connection between the nine divine cauldrons seemed to have disappeared. They trembled and then broke through the sky, flying in all directions, returning to the heads of the nine dragon veins.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew away, and the huge palm continued to smash down.</p><p>Lu Ming could not resist at all. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood, as if he was about to be turned into ashes by this palm.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a Thunder cauldron rushed out automatically. It grew to the size of a mountain and was filled with shocking lightning.</p><p>“What … Why is there another cauldron?”</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>“There are many secret treasures, but how can they stop me?”</p><p>He pressed his palm down on the Thunder cauldron. The Thunder cauldron shook and the lightning spread in all directions. In the end, it could not resist the palm force and was sent back into Lu Ming’s forehead.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as if he had been hit by an archaic divine mountain. His body fell like a cannonball.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s palm print didn’t stop and continued to fall.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s falling body suddenly emitted golden rays of light. When the Golden rays of light spread, Lu Ming’s body stopped falling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, a dazzling light shone. A huge Palace floated out and rushed upwards.</p><p>Countless people almost bit off their tongues. There were too many treasures in Lu Ming’s body. They flew out one after another and each one of them was extremely terrifying. Was he still human?</p><p>“There’s someone under the palace!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The palace that flew out of Lu Ming’s glabella grew rapidly. At the bottom of the palace, there was a towering figure.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>The palace was the Supreme shrine, and the figure below it was the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“MA … Master!”</p><p>When this figure appeared, Yan kuangtu cried out in disbelief.</p><p>At the same time, the six great Supremes and many spiritual God Realm powerhouses also widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>“The nine suns destroys worlds!”</p><p>Nine suns Supreme Master’s Voice rang out, and nine suns suddenly appeared around the Supreme shrine. The nine suns were like real Suns in the sky, emitting endless light.</p><p>The nine suns, together with the Supreme shrine, collided with the huge palm print.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded. The space in that area was instantly twisted into pieces, revealing a dark void that swallowed the terrifying energy.</p><p>Otherwise, the explosion of energy would have turned everything within hundreds of thousands of miles into ashes.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Supreme shrine trembled violently as it fell while being supported by a tall figure. The huge palm seemed to have exhausted its energy and collapsed after blocking the attacks one after another.</p><p>As the light dissipated, the nine suns around the Supreme shrine disappeared, and the figure of the nine suns Supreme Master was clearly revealed.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu roared. His body trembled in excitement.</p><p>“Xia Jiuyang, is it really you? Didn’t you die?”</p><p>The Jiang family’s master shouted as well. The other Supreme martial artists and other powerhouses also looked at nine suns Supreme martial artist in disbelief.</p><p>Many of the younger generation also widened their eyes in shock and disbelief.</p><p>Who didn’t know the name Supreme nine suns? The nine yang bloodline was unparalleled in the world. When he was alive, he was the God of War of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. His combat strength was unparalleled and he was known as the number one sovereign in the eastern barren territory. Even the sovereign path cultivators did not dare to underestimate him.</p><p>Such a magnificent figure had died more than 50 years ago, which shocked countless people and made it hard to believe. However, it was announced by Martial Emperor Di Yi himself, so no one doubted it.</p><p>But now, the nine suns Supreme had reappeared and helped Lu Ming fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi. What was going on?</p><p>“Fanatic, I haven’t seen you for decades and you’ve already grown to this stage. You’re indeed worthy of being my disciple!”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master looked at Yan kuangtu with satisfaction and laughed.</p><p>“Master, what happened back then? Why do you only have a wisp of your soul left? where is your real body? Who did this to you?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was so excited that he asked a few questions in a row.</p><p>The others were also very curious. Back then, Martial Emperor Di Yi only announced the death of nine suns Supreme, but he did not say much about the specific situation. This was a question that many people had been wondering for decades.</p><p>The Supreme of the nine suns had unparalleled combat power. Who could kill him?</p><p>Even an Emperor would find it difficult to kill the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Jiuyang, now that you only have a wisp of your soul left, do you still want to betray me?”</p><p>At this time, a voice full of pressure came from the huge spatial crack in the sky. As the voice fell, a middle-aged man stepped out of the spatial crack.</p><p>The middle-aged man was tall. He stood in the void with his hands behind his back. An unparalleled Majesty spread out and pressed down on millions of miles. When countless people saw this figure, they felt as if they were facing the universe. Deep respect rose in their hearts and they wanted to kneel down.</p><p>That was the pressure of the Imperial Dao, ruling the world.</p><p>“Your Majesty force Emperor!”</p><p>At this moment, countless people from all directions bowed with deep admiration and respect in their eyes.</p><p>Even ruan Tingting, Wang haoxian, and the others were the same. Only fatty stood up straight and did not move.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi glanced around casually and nodded slightly.</p><p>“Betray? Hahaha, Di Yi, don’t you think it’s funny to say this?”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang burst into laughter.</p><p>Countless people were shocked. Supreme nine suns called Martial Emperor Di Yi by his name. It didn’t seem like he was talking to his master at all. Why did he do this?</p><p>But no one made a sound.</p><p>If someone else had called Martial Emperor Di Yi by his name, someone would have jumped out and scolded him. However, it was nine suns Supreme, who had spoken. He was also a Supreme figure, so everyone chose to keep their mouths shut.</p><p>The eyes of the six masters of the ancient families flickered, but they didn’t make a move.</p><p>Among them, the master of the Wang family had already recovered. At this moment, his eyes were the most sinister as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
