Lu Ming could even contend with an ordinary spirit embryo realm expert.</p><p>...</p><p>Among the younger generation, he was not afraid of anyone except for the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was like an ancient beast as he charged forward. He was brutal, violent, and violent as he clashed with the puppets.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He used violent means to break the battle formation formed by the puppets. With a punch, the weak puppets were directly blown apart, and the powerful puppets were also sent flying, their bodies deformed.</p><p>Some of the flames and lightning struck the scales on Lu Ming’s skin but were blocked by them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming blasted away nine powerful puppets in a row and appeared in front of a heaven’s pride expert from the puppet sect. The heaven’s pride expert’s eyes widened and he wanted to retreat, but Lu Ming’s palm made him spit out a mouthful of blood. He reached out, grabbed, and threw, directly to the side of rising sun and Guan Rong. Three figures appeared on the ground, all lying on the ground, unable to get up.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After dealing with this Paragon, Lu Ming stomped his feet and soared into the sky. He destroyed two scorching fireballs, a lightning sword, and a flood Dragon formed from ice in succession. He appeared in front of a Paragon from the talisman sect and punched through his talisman defense. Essential core surged in, and the Paragon’s body went limp. He was thrown beside sunrise and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and charged at another prodigy like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>It was unstoppable. All the puppets and inscription scrolls were destroyed by Lu Ming. One by one, the figures were sent flying by Lu Ming and fell beside the rising sun and the others.</p><p>The people who were watching the battle were all dumbfounded. Their jaws were about to drop as they looked at everything in disbelief.</p><p>More than a dozen God-level prodigies joined forces, but they could not put up any resistance in front of Lu Ming. They were completely crushed and sent flying one by one. Lu Ming threw them on the ground like garbage and piled them up.</p><p>In just a few minutes, more than ten people were left there by Lu Ming. All of them were furious and ashamed.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>Some of the remaining people shouted and wanted to admit defeat.</p><p>They were really frightened by Lu Ming’s terrifying combat strength.</p><p>“You want to fight and you don’t want to fight and you don’t want to fight, how can there be such a good thing? I won’t allow it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. His figure was like an ancient beast as he charged at the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Then, that heaven’s favorite was piled together with the rising sun and the others.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and another two geniuses were sent flying.</p><p>“Tianyun, this is the talisman Amulet sect. What kind of skill is it for you to win with martial arts? if you have the ability, use the Dao of inscription!”</p><p>One of the remaining heaven’s favorites shouted.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, the puppet protecting him was sent flying by Lu Ming. He was also kicked away by Lu Ming and crashed into the group of elites, causing the others to scream in pain.</p><p>The entire arena fell silent. The dozen or so heaven’s favorites were all gathered together and roaring in anger. This caused the countless Talisman Amulet sect disciples to be dumbfounded. They could not believe what they were seeing.</p><p>These were the few God-tier prodigies of the talisman sect.</p><p>Although the talisman sect’s territory was far from being comparable to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, it still had over 30 large regions and countless geniuses. There were so many geniuses, but less than 50 God-grade geniuses.</p><p>Which one of these heaven’s favorites wasn’t high up in the air? they were like the stars surrounding the moon, looking down on the younger generation.</p><p>But now, there were more than a dozen of them. They were like a pile of garbage, roaring and screaming. It was too horrible to look at.</p><p>This scene was too illusionary and unreal.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Some people even slapped themselves to see if they were dreaming.</p><p>Bai chixue was also stunned.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. More than a dozen paragons joined forces and they were all defeated in a short time. He was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>She recalled the attitude she had towards Lu Ming when she first met him. Her heart could not help but beat faster and she felt a little scared. If Lu Ming went crazy, she, a weak woman, would not be able to take it.</p><p>“This guy is so strong, but he didn’t tell me. Hmph!”</p><p>Then, Bai chixue snorted in her heart.</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tongtong, and Meng Jia were also shocked as they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>The three of them were all ranked in the top 120 on the list of top 1000 talents. Naturally, their combat strength was unparalleled and they were powerful. However, they were not confident that they could defeat more than a dozen divine-level geniuses as easily as Lu Ming.</p><p>even if this fellow’s combat strength can’t be compared to those freaks in the top 100, it’s almost on par with di Feng, Shi mo, and the others. My Talisman Amulet sect actually has such a powerful martial arts expert, and at such a young age at that? ”</p><p>Ji mai murmured, his voice was filled with shock and surprise.</p><p>He was ranked 107th on the list of top 1000 talents, but he didn’t think he could do that.</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He could feel that the vital essence in his spirit sea had been greatly depleted. In the violent storm of attacks just now, the prison suppressing heavenly art had not only unleashed twenty percent of its power.</p><p>“Tianyun, what kind of skill is it for you to use martial arts? If you have the ability, then use the Dao of inscription to fight us!”</p><p>A young man shouted. His eyes were about to spit fire, and he was extremely ashamed and resentful.</p><p>that’s right. You’re a zongzi candidate, but you can only use martial arts against your enemies. Who would be convinced? ”</p><p>zongzi candidates will have to compete for the position of zongzi and then inherit the position of sect leader of the talisman Amulet sect. If one is only strong in martial arts and not good in the Dao of inscription, how can one inherit the position of sect leader and take charge of the talisman Amulet sect? ”</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites also shouted.</p><p>&Nbsp; the eyes of the other spectators flashed.</p><p>That was indeed the case. They did not deny that Lu Ming was powerful. If Lu Ming was just an ordinary disciple of the talisman Amulet sect, even if his Dao of inscription was weak, he would still be respected by others due to his powerful martial arts.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s status was different. He was a zongzi candidate. In the future, he would compete for the position of zongzi or even the sect leader of the talisman Amulet sect. That would not do. He had to have a strong inscription Dao to convince the masses.</p><p>Otherwise, no matter how strong one’s martial Dao was, one would not be qualified to inherit the position of sect master.</p><p>“How about this!”</p><p>At this moment, Ji mai suddenly opened his mouth and attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Was Ji mai going to make a move?</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also shifted to Ji mai.</p><p>in two months, the sect will hold a competition to determine who will enter the observatory. The observatory is the number one sacred cultivation ground of the talisman sect. Other than the 13 zongzis who will not be participating, all the other young geniuses will be participating. Brother tianyun, why don’t you join us and compare notes with our fellow disciples? ”</p><p>Ji mai said with a smile.</p><p>Although he said it tactfully, it was equivalent to an invitation to a battle. He was inviting Lu Ming to participate in the competition two months later to fight for the quota to enter the heaven Observatory.</p><p>Martial arts were not of much use in that kind of competition. They would naturally know how good Lu Ming’s Dao of inscription was when the time came.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>No matter what, at least for the next two months, he would have peace and no one would disturb him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
