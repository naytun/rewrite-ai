Their third bloodline didn’t awaken.</p><p>...</p><p>The power of his bloodline had clearly accumulated to a great extent, but it had yet to awaken.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the blood pool and sighed softly. Then, he strode out.</p><p>There was still no news of Jian feiliu. It was as if he had sunk into the endless depths of the blood pool.</p><p>The three of them walked out of the cave and flew toward the center of ninedragons.</p><p>Their next step was to go to another high-level cultivation Holy Land, the heaven vault relic.</p><p>It was said that there were many God-grade geniuses cultivating there.</p><p>The moment the three of them walked out of the cave, a figure soared into the sky tens of miles away, chasing after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After flying for a few hundred miles, Lu Ming and the other two suddenly stopped in their tracks. This was because they realized that there was a cold killing intent behind them that was spreading toward them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of purple light streaked through the air and appeared in front of them.</p><p>She was a beautiful woman, but her eyes were cold, and the killing intent on her body was cold.</p><p>“The Wang clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?” Wang haoxian’s gaze fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His brows furrowed even more tightly because he could sense an extremely dangerous aura from this lady.</p><p>very good. Did you kill my brother, Wang Haotian? ”</p><p>Wang haoxian said coldly.</p><p>Wang Haotian is your brother? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He suddenly remembered that before Wang Haotian died, he had shouted that his sister would avenge him.</p><p>“Speak, did you kill him?”</p><p>Wang haoxian shouted, his killing intent even colder.</p><p>I say, beautiful lady, if we kill him, then we kill him. Your brother deserves to be killed. If you want to avenge him, we’ll take you on!</p><p>Kong Jin shouted.</p><p>“Good, very good. The three of you will be buried with my brother!”</p><p>Terrifying flames rose from Wang haoxian’s body and a powerful aura burst out.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wang haoxian was extremely violent. He threw a punch at Lu Ming, and a fiery fist radiance was blasted towards him. A vacuum tunnel was created in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. This punch gave him a lot of pressure.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming used all his strength and activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique, throwing a punch as well.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion rang out. Lu Ming felt an unparalleled force surging forward. He retreated rapidly and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>??…</p><p>At the same time, there was a terrifying flame burning on his fist, and a burning smell came out.</p><p>Lu Ming released four types of concepts and essential core to resist the burning of the flames with all his might.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was actually injured by the other party in one move. The other party’s combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The peak of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>This was the cultivation that Wang haoxian had revealed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming firmly believed that an average fifth level spiritual ocean tier prodigy would not have such powerful combat strength that could completely crush him.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes were cold as he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin made their moves at the same time.</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his hands together and the sky demon force field exploded. The destructive cutting force rushed towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>Kong Jin rushed into the sky demon power field with his axe. His axe seemed to be able to split the sky, and he swung it at Wang haoxian.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Wang haoxian didn’t even look at it. He threw a punch at the incoming axe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist slammed into the battle-ax, and a massive sound like that of a Bell rang out. Fatty let out a miserable shriek as he was sent flying backward. His fat began to tremble, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Wang haoxian’s body trembled and purple flames spread out. Xie nianqing’s destructive cutting power was directly burned.</p><p>That’s right, even the destructive cutting power was burned clean.</p><p>Then, he threw a punch at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression changed. He used the demonic hand and formed a beautiful arm that flew towards Wang haoxian’s fist radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The result was the same as before. Xie nianqing was sent flying back and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Although Xie nianqing and Kong Jin had broken through to the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, they were still crushed.</p><p>let’s attack together! This person is a God-tier heaven’s favorite!</p><p>Lu Ming came over in a flash and stood side by side with Xie nianqing. His expression was extremely serious.</p><p>He thought of a man on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Wang haoxian was ranked 293rd on the list of top 1000 talents. Since his name was close to Wang Haotian’s, he must be Wang Haotian’s sister.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wang haoxian was extremely domineering. His body was covered in purple flames as he stepped forward.</p><p>“Sky demon force field, destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and pressed her hand down. The destructive cutting force enveloped Wang haoxian.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming and Kong Jin moved. They charged into the otherworldly demon force field and charged towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>The four-colored will intertwined, and the war Dragon true energy completely exploded. His spirit sea was boiling, and a powerful devouring power erupted from his left palm, enveloping Wang haoxian. His right palm executed the prison suppressing heavenly art and slashed at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Kong Jin roared as his fat body expanded once again. The earth and shattering intents fused and exploded, capable of destroying everything.</p><p>His battle-ax turned into a ray of black light and slashed at Wang haoxian.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing used the demonic lotus throne. A Black Lotus throne appeared. The petals of the Lotus throne were like the sharpest weapons, and they attacked Wang haoxian.</p><p>At this moment, the three of them launched their strongest attacks at the same time. They didn’t dare to be careless in the face of a god-tier genius.</p><p>“Setting sun sacred heavenly fist!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s fists glowed with fire and he punched three times in a row.</p><p>With one punch, Xie nianqing’s Lotus platform was shattered and the destructive cutting force field collapsed. Xie nianqing’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly, blood flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>With another punch, Kong Jin was sent flying. The battle-ax in his hand trembled non-stop, especially Fatty’s arm. The veins on his arm were protruding and blood was seeping out. Even his palm was deformed.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly better, but he was also sent flying a thousand meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood and felt a sharp pain in his palm. His bones and armor were almost broken.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong. The three of them had joined forces, but they were still instantly injured.</p><p>Wang haoxian had almost no weaknesses.</p><p>Compared to Wang haoxian, Lu Ming did not have an advantage in any aspect.</p><p>First of all, his cultivation was three levels lower than Wang haoxian’s.</p><p>Lu Ming had a divine level bloodline, so did Wang haoxian. Lu Ming had a demigod level bloodline martial technique like the prison-suppressing heaven technique, and Wang haoxian had a demigod level bloodline martial technique.</p><p>It was said that the bloodline martial techniques comprehended from the divine bloodline were at least demigod-level martial techniques.</p><p>Moreover, Wang haoxian’s cultivation technique was also a God-level cultivation technique, the sky-burning flame technique.</p><p>The sky-burning flames was so hot that it could burn everything. One had to use a lot of true essence to resist its burning power.</p><p>In terms of intent, Wang haoxian’s intent of heaven and earth had evolved from the intent of fire. It was extremely powerful and had reached the completion of level two.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had comprehended four kinds of intent, they were too low level. Even if he had four kinds of outburst and was stronger than Wang haoxian, he would not be much stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s only advantage was that he had cultivated the secret skill of the Super spirit sea and had rich vital essence. His mastery of the divine level technique was also stronger than Wang haoxian’s. In addition, his intent was slightly stronger. All these could make up for the difference of one level of cultivation.</p><p>However, Wang haoxian’s cultivation was three levels higher than Lu Ming’s. Therefore, there was still a gap of two levels between Lu Ming and Wang haoxian.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing and Kong Jin, they hadn’t awakened a divine bloodline, so the gap between them was even greater.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
