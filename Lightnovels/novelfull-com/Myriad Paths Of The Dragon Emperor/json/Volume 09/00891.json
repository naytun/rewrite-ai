He knew that Bai Shijin was trying to build up momentum for Lu Ming but he did not refute or stop him.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, Bai Shijin’s voice was heard again, and the scene became quiet.</p><p>I hereby announce the results of this competition. First place, tianyun. Second place, Ji mai. Third place, Yan Tongtong!</p><p>Bai Shijin announced. Then, he changed his tone and said, ” originally, the plan to enter the observatory this time was to have three spots. However, because many geniuses have emerged this time and the quality is very high, and the battle of Providence is approaching, the elders and I have decided to increase the number of spots to five.</p><p>other than Tian Yun, Ji mai, and Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia and Hu Ming can also enter the observatory. Alright, the competition is over. You guys can rest for a while and enter the observatory tomorrow!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice fell, and the competition ended.</p><p>As for Meng Jia and H Ming, they were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>The other people at the scene also cast envious looks at them.</p><p>“Tianyun, so you’re actually this powerful?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Bai chixue’s hand and flew towards the direction of the cloud Peak House. There was a group of young women swarming towards Lu Ming from one direction. Lu Ming ran away immediately.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of miles, the two finally slowed down.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming felt that he was holding a small, cold hand. He turned around and saw Bai chixue looking at him with her big eyes, blushing.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly let go and said,”I’m sorry, I was in a hurry just now …”</p><p>“In a moment of urgency, or taking the opportunity to take advantage of me?”</p><p>Bai chixue smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times in embarrassment.</p><p>“Why are you running so fast? Don’t you feel good with so many beautiful women chasing after you? You must be secretly proud of yourself, right?”</p><p>Bai chixue joked.</p><p>“I’m not, I already have someone I like!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Xie nianqing’s figure flashed across his mind. He wondered how she was doing. She should have returned to the ancient Sage dynasty in the central continent!</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face stiffened when she heard that Lu Ming already had someone in his heart. A trace of disappointment and sadness flashed in her eyes, but it was only for a moment. Then, she smiled again and said, ” “She must be very beautiful to be valued by you, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s very beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then looked at Bai chixue with a smile, ” “What’s wrong? Don’t tell me you’ve taken a fancy to me?”</p><p>“Go, don’t be so smug!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face turned red in an instant. Then, she glared at Lu Ming and said, ” “You’re still far from being able to Make Me Like You! If it’s a prodigy like Lu Ming, that’s more like it!”</p><p>cough, cough, cough!</p><p>Lu Ming could not stop coughing.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Bai chixue asked.</p><p>“My throat is uncomfortable, but I’m fine!” Lu Ming was spouting nonsense.</p><p>no way. You’re so strong in martial arts. Why would your throat feel uncomfortable? ” Bai chixue was surprised.</p><p>“I’m fine. Let’s go back to Cloud Peak House first!”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic and walked towards Yun Feng house.</p><p>……</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming arrived at the peak of a mountain. There was a huge altar on the peak.</p><p>Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, Meng Jia, and Hu Ming were also with them.</p><p>In addition, there were also Bai Shijin, du songjue, and a few other elders.</p><p>now, we’ll open the passage to the observatory. You can go and cultivate. However, you only have one month. After one month, you will be transported back. So, in this one month, you must make the best use of your time to cultivate!</p><p>Bai Shijin warned.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded.</p><p>They knew very well that in order to open the path to the observatory and maintain it for a month, they would need to consume a terrifying amount of raw stones. Furthermore, the more people who entered, the more resources they would need to consume.</p><p>Therefore, the quota to enter the observatory was extremely precious.</p><p>Before this, only the 13 zongzis had entered.</p><p>In the past, only three people from each generation could enter, because the consumption was too great.</p><p>Now that the battle of karmic luck had arrived, and this generation was the golden age, more people would be allowed to enter.</p><p>After which, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the three elders, a total of five people, surrounded the huge altar and began to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>Countless raw gemstones flew out of their hands and were swallowed by the altar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A moment later, the altar glowed brightly and countless inscriptions interweaved. A huge vortex suddenly appeared on it.</p><p>the passage is open. Hurry up and enter!</p><p>Bai Shijin shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of five did not dare to delay. They stepped onto the altar and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>Of course, dandan did not follow them. She was thrown to Yun Peak House by Lu Ming.</p><p>He felt dizzy. The next moment, Lu Ming found himself standing on a platform.</p><p>The platform was suspended in the air, about two meters wide.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that he seemed to be in the starry sky of the universe. There was an endless starry sky in all directions and a vast starry sky below him. There was only a platform floating in the sky.</p><p>On his left and right, Lu Ming saw two platforms. Ji mai, Meng Jia, and the other two were on one platform each. They were looking around in surprise.</p><p>In front of him was a vast River. It was extremely majestic and seemed to cross the entire starry sky, extending from one end of the universe to the other.</p><p>“This is the inscription law!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was not the first time he had seen the inscription law.</p><p>In the past, he had seen it through mental cultivation methods and in a meditative state, but now, he seemed to be really close to the inscription laws.</p><p>With a single thought, he could feel the vast power of inscription in front of him. Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was throbbing violently.</p><p>The observatory, it was indeed the observatory. To actually be able to observe the inscription laws at such a close distance, it was truly inconceivable.</p><p>At such a close distance, how fast would he be able to absorb the power of inscription?</p><p>At this moment, Ji mai and the other three were already sitting cross-legged, circulating their mental energy fire cultivation method and starting to absorb the power of inscription.</p><p>The rich power of inscription kept pouring into Ji mai and the other three, as if it had turned into four light pillars, enveloping the four.</p><p>“What a dense power of inscription!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, without further ado, he sat down cross-legged and activated the meditation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In an instant, he felt that he had connected with the inscription law. A bright beam of light descended from the inscription law and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Ji mai, Meng Jia, and the other two opened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>They realized that the light pillar on Lu Ming’s body, which was condensed by the power of inscription, was more than ten times stronger than theirs.</p><p>what kind of cultivation technique is he practicing? it’s so terrifying!</p><p>The four of them were shocked.</p><p>The mental visualization that they cultivated was already the best in the talisman Amulet sect. However, Lu Ming’s seemed to be even more amazing than theirs.</p><p>After a while, they collected their thoughts and continued to cultivate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
