The wisps of true dragon blood in it circulated through his body, which was extremely beneficial to the body and could increase its strength.</p><p>...</p><p>If it could be consumed in the long term, the benefits would be endless.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, how can there be no wine when there’s meat? here you go!”</p><p>The fatty waved his hand and jars of fine wine appeared. They flew towards Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest.</p><p>Everyone opened the wine jars and began to drink in big gulps.</p><p>“Fatty, I didn’t expect your skills to be so good!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting took a few sips of wine, but she didn’t use her internal energy to force the wine out. Immediately, two red flowers floated on her beautiful little face, making her even more beautiful.</p><p>Fatty was stunned and almost drooled. “Tingting, how is it? Follow me from now on, and I guarantee you’ll have a good life every day!”</p><p>Xie nianqing, Qiao Xuan, and the rest looked down on fatty. This reason was too shallow.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the rest were gobbling down the food and wine, many important figures came to the dragon’s head, below the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>They received the news that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which had remained motionless for ages, had moved. They immediately rushed over to check the situation. Unfortunately, no matter how they tried, there was no movement from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>They didn’t know why the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had moved. In the end, they could only leave it at that.</p><p>More than two hours later, Lu Ming had his fill. As for the rest of the flood dragon meat, the fatty put it away in the name of storage.</p><p>Just like that, they sat cross-legged on the small mountain peak and cultivated on their own, waiting for the exchange meeting two days later.</p><p>Wang haoxian wasn’t cultivating, and she was in a mess.</p><p>In the past, she had been focused on cultivation and the only person she was close to was her brother. She had no other friends and was out of place with the other Wang family geniuses.</p><p>However, in the past few days, when she was with Lu Ming and the rest, she felt very relaxed and comfortable. She suddenly felt that she enjoyed such an atmosphere.</p><p>“Is this what friends are?”</p><p>Wang haoxian muttered and shook his head. He told himself that he was only following Lu Ming because he had no other choice. If there was a chance, he would still avenge her brother.</p><p>Although she tried her best to convince herself, her heart could not calm down, and she did not have the mood to cultivate.</p><p>Naturally, the others did not know that Wang haoxian was having wild thoughts. Time passed very quickly during cultivation. In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>On this day, the huge platform under the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was bustling with people.</p><p>Many handsome and beautiful young men and women with different auras flew into the sky and landed on the seats around the open space.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and fatty arrived at the place. They found an area and sat down.</p><p>there are so many heaven’s favorites. Most of the top 300 heaven’s favorites have appeared!</p><p>Wang haoxian looked around and said softly.</p><p>Among them, only Wang haoxian was on the list of top 1000 talents. Naturally, he knew more people than Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Not long after, tens of thousands of people gathered around the open space.</p><p>Of course, most of the young people were here to watch the show. It was impossible for them to participate in the exchange meeting.</p><p>The exchange this time was destined to be a battle between the top figures.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect is here!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>From the North, a group of more than 200 people, all dressed in black robes and wrapped their bodies, flew over.</p><p>Of course, all the people here were young people, and there were no elders.</p><p>The most eye-catching person was the one flying in the front. He was tall and carried a coffin on his back. The coffin was pitch black. Even though it was broad daylight and there were so many people, everyone still felt that it was gloomy and very scary.</p><p>“He’s corpse demon, ranked 102nd on the list of top 1000 talents! He’s refining corpses like a devil!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face was unusually serious.</p><p>The others ‘faces also revealed a grave expression.</p><p>The 102nd place on the list of top 1000 talents was absolutely terrifying. Obviously, Shi mo was the leader of the heavenly corpse sect this time.</p><p>More than two hundred people from the sky corpse sect stood in the void, motionless.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds came from the East as young figures flew over.</p><p>The number of people was also about two hundred.</p><p>However, these young men all had different auras. Some revealed a fierce look, some were full of heroic spirit, some were extremely cold, and some were extremely charming.</p><p>The clothes they wore were also of strange shapes and colors.</p><p>The demon clan of the sky demon Valley had arrived.</p><p>The demons of the sky demon Valley also stood in the sky, exuding a powerful aura as they looked down.</p><p>Their gazes swept across the entire place with faint disdain.</p><p>The heavenly talents of the demon clan of the sky demon Valley had the bloodline of the divine beast. They thought they were superior and looked down on human warriors.</p><p>It was only a rumor in the past, but it seemed that it was true.</p><p>“It’s that flood Dragon!”</p><p>The fat man clicked his tongue and whispered.</p><p>Among the demons, they saw a burly young man with a broken leg. He was the flood Dragon that fatty had cut off two days ago.</p><p>The flood dragon’s eyes were extremely gloomy as he swept his gaze across the entire scene. In the next moment, he saw Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were also in the East.</p><p>As soon as the flood Dragon saw Lu Ming and the rest, a cold killing intent appeared in its eyes. It whispered a few words into the ear of a young man in red armor next to it.</p><p>Then, the red-armored young man looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a cold gaze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The flood Dragon and the young man in red armor appeared above Lu Ming and the others in an instant. Their powerful and violent auras exploded and pressed down on Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At the side, the others were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group sat still.</p><p>“You guys were the ones who crippled ao Qian’s leg?”</p><p>The young man in red armor said coldly as he looked down at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>flood dragon meat. It tastes really good! The fat man licked his lips and sneered.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The red-armored young man shouted in anger. His aura became more violent, as if he was going to kill someone in the next moment.</p><p>The other young demons looked on with cold smiles.</p><p>“Friends from the monster race, the exchange hasn’t started yet. Please go back now!”</p><p>Right at this moment, a voice that was as clear as the wind drifted over from the distance. As the voice faded, a figure appeared in the air.</p><p>It was a young man wearing a green robe. He had sword-like eyebrows and a handsome face. He had a gentle smile on his face, but there was an invisible Majesty coming from his body.</p><p>“Di Feng, it’s di Feng!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Di Feng, who was ranked 101st on the list of top 1000 talents, was said to be a descendant of Martial Emperor Di Yi. He had the talent of his ancestor and was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Di Feng!”</p><p>The red-armored youth’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Di Feng looked at the red-armored youth and the flood Dragon and smiled, you two, please return. If you want to fight, wait for the exchange to begin. There will naturally be a battle!</p><p>Since di Feng had spoken, the red-armored youth naturally had to give him face.</p><p>He snorted coldly and looked at Lu Ming and the rest.”You broke one of ao Qian’s legs, I will pay you back double!”</p><p>With that, he and ao Qian flew back to the demon team.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
