It could continuously fuse with other precious metals to increase the grade of the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>...</p><p>Although there were even higher-grade spiritual weapons in the storage ring of the nine suns Supreme Master, such as seventh-grade and even eighth-grade spiritual weapons, there was no lack of spear-type spiritual weapons.</p><p>However, even though the quality of those spirit weapons was high, they had no potential and their grades were fixed.</p><p>As for the infinite Dragon Spear, it was Lu Ming’s Natal spiritual weapon and it had unlimited potential. Naturally, Lu Ming would choose to use it.</p><p>Three hours later, the infinite Dragon Spear buzzed and glowed brightly.</p><p>“Level 6, top quality!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>After integrating a piece of precious Star Moon iron and Lu Ming’s inscription, the infinite Dragon Spear was refined again. It was upgraded to a level-six premium item.</p><p>In the sky, there seemed to be a force of inscription that fell from the sky and fused into Lu Ming’s mental energy fire, causing it to slowly improve.</p><p>This was the reward given to him by the law of inscription after he had forged a top grade sixth-level spiritual weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming was not satisfied with the level-six premium product. He took out another piece of precious metal and started to refine it.</p><p>A day later, the infinite Dragon Spear trembled again and reached the peerless Lv 6.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current level of inscription and the good materials, it was not difficult for him to refine a level six masterpiece.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming had to refine the infinite Dragon Spear to Level Seven. This would be more difficult.</p><p>He took out a few pieces of precious metals in succession. The blue mental energy fire spread out and Lu Ming began to refine.</p><p>This time, it took a full three days.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear trembled continuously as its spear radiance shot into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly waved his hand and entered the Supreme shrine with the infinite Dragon Spear to avoid disturbing the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear glowed with a dazzling light. The Spear’s radiance soared into the sky and a powerful aura spread out.</p><p>Lv 7, upper Lv 7!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was overjoyed.</p><p>It was a success. Lu Ming had upgraded the infinite Dragon Spear to upper seventh level. It was a huge leap and he had forged a seventh level spiritual weapon. If others were to know about this, they would be scared to death.</p><p>It was already very impressive for an inscription master to be able to refine the highest grade or peerless grade of their own grade. It was too difficult to refine a spirit weapon that was one grade higher. Ordinary true inscription blacksmiths could not do it at all.</p><p>Furthermore, the higher the grade of the spirit weapon, the harder it was to forge.</p><p>Currently, only one of Lu Ming’s level-six Blue Spirit lamps had been lit up. If he lit up a few more, it was not impossible for him to refine a level-seven premium or even a level-seven Supreme-grade.</p><p>In the dark, wisps of the power of inscription descended and Lu Ming’s mental energy fire continued to grow.</p><p>Suddenly, the second lamp of mind lit up, and a blue flame started to burn.</p><p>Lu Ming lit up the second Blue Spirit lamp and his mental energy was stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He held the long spear and waved it casually. The space trembled and the faint roar of a Dragon could be heard.</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming kept his infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>“Eh? The path-understanding ancient tree has changed!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming moved and appeared on another platform. The path-understanding ancient tree was placed there.</p><p>At this moment, the path-understanding ancient tree was sparkling. It was surrounded by rings of light, and a mysterious aura floated out.</p><p>There was a green leaf on the black branch. It was dark green and crystal clear. There were mysterious patterns on it, as if it contained the universe’s truth.</p><p>Next to the dark green leaf, a second tender green leaf appeared.</p><p>More than ten days ago, Lu Ming had watered the Mother of Water spirit spring on the xuanhuang silicotic soil. As expected, the Mother of Water spirit spring was a rare treasure in the world. It successfully made the path-understanding ancient tree grow its second leaf.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and carefully pondered over it. After a while, he opened his eyes, which were filled with surprise.</p><p>The second leaf of the path-understanding ancient tree had indeed increased Lu Ming’s speed of comprehension.</p><p>In the past, it was equivalent to ten times the normal state. Now, it was twenty times.</p><p>Yes, under the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s state of comprehension was twenty times that of normal circumstances.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was overjoyed. In that case, his cultivation speed would increase again.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was indeed a rare treasure in the world. In the ancient times, only the strongest had it.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and quietly comprehended the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Soon, another seven days passed. Lu Ming went out to retrieve the demonic beast blood essence that Wang haoxian had sent over.</p><p>This time, there were four sets of fifth level spiritual ocean tier demonic beast blood essence and three sets of sixth level spiritual ocean tier demonic beast blood essence. After refining them, the nine Dragon bloodline still did not advance.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming refined the blood essence once every seven days and spent the rest of his time on cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Lu Ming took control of Wang haoxian.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects, especially the heaven and earth mentality, Thunder mentality, and earth mentality. They had reached level two lower tier and were about to reach that level.</p><p>At this time, the bloodline of the nine Dragons had finally reached its limit and was about to advance.</p><p>This was the fourth time Lu Ming was refining the demonic beast blood essence that Wang haoxian had given him.</p><p>In the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared into the sky. Its body twisted and rolled in the air, and its body was covered in light.</p><p>As the nine holes bloodline howled, its body began to grow longer and thicker. The scales on its body became more dazzling and crystal clear.</p><p>A claw extended out from the abdomen of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The fifth claw!</p><p>Five claws, a true dragon.</p><p>A moment later, a thousand-meter long, wriggling true dragon with five claws under its belly appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>There was a golden chakra on the true Dragon’s body, shining with a dazzling light.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had finally advanced to the divine level and transformed into the body of a true dragon.</p><p>Afterwards!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared, and its aura soared into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, in the depths of ninedragons, where the three dragon veins converged, there was a Palace. This Palace was suspended in the air. It seemed to be in the depths of the void. It could be seen, but it could not be approached.</p><p>In the deepest part of the palace, there was a figure sitting cross-legged in the void.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man in his fifties. He wore a black battle robe and had a burly figure. He sat quietly with his eyes closed, but there seemed to be endless majesty exuding from his body. It was as if this man was a peerless Overlord, a peerless Emperor who could sweep across the universe and control countless creatures.</p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes. At this moment, the whole world lit up, and the surrounding space was instantly annihilated, as if it couldn’t withstand the huge pressure and turned into a dark chaotic space.</p><p>“The bloodline of the nine Dragons has finally appeared? It seems to have evolved to the God rank!”</p><p>“Eh? Jiuyang, you’ve put in a lot of effort to isolate the aura of the blood essence of the nine Dragons with a seal. Unfortunately, you’ve underestimated me. You can’t see through my means. Even if there’s a seal, I have my own way to detect it. The blood essence of the nine Dragons seems to be in ninedragons!”</p><p>“Eh? There’s actually a treasure blocking it!”</p><p>The middle-aged man muttered. After a while, he frowned.</p><p>He could sense that the bloodline of the nine Dragons was in ninedragons, but he could not sense its exact location.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
