Brother Jian’s bloodline won’t actively absorb the surrounding bloodline power!”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming realized that Jian feiliu’s spine did not absorb the power of the blood Meridian.</p><p>“Let me give him a hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and controlled the power of the blood Meridian. It surged into Jian feiliu’s neck. However, the power of the blood Meridian dissipated very quickly and was not absorbed.</p><p>“How could this be? Could it be that brother Jian is on the verge of death and has lost his consciousness, so he can’t absorb the power of the bloodline? what should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>If he couldn’t absorb the power of bloodline, how could he save Jian feiliu?</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me do it. I have a way to let the power of the blood Meridian flow into his neck. Although it’s a little slow, it’s more or less useful!”</p><p>Dandan appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder and said.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Nonsense, the things that this Lord knows are not things that you can imagine. When this Lord fully recovers, don’t cry and ask this Lord to be your master.”</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>After that, dandan flew in front of Jian feiliu and waved its claws. Runes entered Jian feiliu’s body. Then, it waved its claws and the surrounding bloodline power was drawn into Jian feiliu’s spine, slowly seeping in.</p><p>It was really useful. Lu Ming was relieved.</p><p>“What is it? Get lost!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to absorb the power of the blood Meridian in peace, dandan suddenly let out a loud, angry cry.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, something is invading Jian feiliu’s body. I can sense it but I can’t stop it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“What? There’s something. What’s in the blood pool?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>haha, my cultivation has been crippled and my bloodline has been exhausted. I’ll have to start all over again. I’ll break and rebuild!</p><p>A burst of laughter suddenly came from Jian feiliu’s body. It was full of excitement.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and shouted,”Who are you?” Hurry up and get out of brother Jian’s body!”</p><p>“Who am I? It’s just a wisp of a remnant soul. It should have sunk into eternal oblivion, but it was awakened by this kid!”</p><p>Jian feifu’s voice came out of his body again, and at the same time, a blood-red light spread out.</p><p>“Remnant soul? You want to take over my body?” Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin also arrived at top speed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>“There’s a soul fragment here that wants to possess brother Jian!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were both shocked.</p><p>“Haha, possession? Little guy, you really think too highly of me. I only have a wisp of my soul left and can turn into dust at any time, so how can I possess you? it’s just that this little guy is suitable to inherit my legacy!”</p><p>The sound of Jian Feilu’s body rang out.</p><p>“How can I believe your words!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Little fellow, even if you don’t believe it, you have to believe it! Hahaha!”</p><p>As he laughed, Jian feiliu’s body was covered with blood light and he suddenly fell down rapidly.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and chased down.</p><p>However, the resistance in the blood pool was very strong. Lu Ming’s speed was far from Jian feiliu’s speed.</p><p>Lu Ming chased for two thousand meters but Jian feiliu’s body was getting further and further down.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>Endless killing intent surged from all directions. Lu Ming’s face turned pale. The further down he went, the more intense the murderous aura and killing intent became. Even with Lu Ming’s mental fortitude, it was very difficult for him to resist.</p><p>After a few more breaths, Jian feiliu’s body disappeared completely and sank into the endless blood pool.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is not your fault!”</p><p>Xie nianqing swam over and said.</p><p>Her face was also a little pale.</p><p>Fatty also swam over, but he didn’t say much.</p><p>“Lu Ming, maybe the voice was right. It’s just a wisp of a remnant soul that can’t possess someone. Maybe it’s really looking for a successor?”</p><p>Dandan frowned.</p><p>“You’re confident?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!” Dandan shook her head.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to throw dandan out.</p><p>“Little Qing, fatty, wait for me here. I’ll go down and take a look!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming continued to head down.</p><p>The killing intent in the surroundings grew stronger and stronger. The terrifying murderous aura and killing intent had already made Lu Ming’s soul tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming dove for another thousand meters. The murderous aura and killing intent here had reached a terrifying level. Not only could it obliterate souls, but it could also obliterate the physical body. Lu Ming felt a tearing pain in his body and his soul.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jian feiliu was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little indignant but he could not continue. If he continued, he would be in danger.</p><p>Feeling helpless, Lu Ming could only go up.</p><p>He had never thought that he would end up like this when he came to the blood pool to save Jian feiliu. He could only hope that Jian feiliu was fine.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this might be an opportunity for Jian feiliu. You don’t have to blame yourself!”</p><p>Xie nianqing advised.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m fine. Let’s continue to accumulate the power of the blood Meridian!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them went up and found a more suitable place to absorb the power of the bloodline. Once they got used to it, they would continue down.</p><p>The further down he went, the more concentrated his bloodline power became.</p><p>Time passed day by day. The power of the blood Meridian accumulated at Lu Ming’s spine was getting stronger and stronger. The blood-red light glowed as if something powerful was about to be born.</p><p>Just half a day after they entered the blood pool, Wang haoxian also arrived.</p><p>Wang haoxian, you’ve already entered the blood pool and awakened your divine bloodline. The blood pool is useless to you now. What are you doing here? ”</p><p>The middle-aged man opened his eyes and looked at Wang haoxian.</p><p>senior, I’m here to ask about a few people. There are three of them. One of them is a fatty and the other is an extremely beautiful woman …</p><p>Wang haoxian described the appearance of the three of them.</p><p>“They entered the blood pool half a day ago. If you want to find them, you can only wait for them to come out.”</p><p>After saying that, the middle-aged man closed his eyes.</p><p>“It’s really here!”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in Wang haoxian’s eyes. He retreated and sat cross-legged on another mountain peak a few miles away from the blood pool, guarding it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>The time was up, and they had to leave.</p><p>The third servant rushed out of the blood pool and stood beside it.</p><p>Lu Ming noticed that Xie nianqing and his spine were emitting shocking fluctuations, as if something was about to break out of the cocoon. However, after a while, the blood-red aura slowly converged and the fluctuations at their spines slowly hid.</p><p>It was the same for Lu Ming. He also hid at his spine.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. It seemed that the third bloodline could not be awakened yet. There seemed to be some missing conditions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
