No wonder he’s so arrogant. But if I awaken a divine bloodline, I’ll definitely beat him up!</p><p>...</p><p>The fatty was cursing, but he was very confident.</p><p>fatty, you’re just bragging. You can awaken a bloodline that’s above divine level five? ”</p><p>Ruan Tingting attacked.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar, and there were all kinds of discussions.</p><p>A 50% concentration of the divine beast bloodline was equivalent to a human’s fifth-level divine bloodline. In the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory, only the top geniuses had such a bloodline.</p><p>Even di Feng and Shi mo, who were the strongest at the scene, were said to only have fourth level divine bloodlines.</p><p>If aokun’s cultivation increased, he would be able to compete with the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Who else is coming up?”</p><p>Aokun looked around arrogantly.</p><p>Everyone was silent. After a long time, one person from the heavenly corpse sect went up.</p><p>This person was an extremely famous heaven’s favorite, ranked 189th on the list of top 1000 talents. He had awakened a third level divine bloodline and had a cultivation at the peak of the sixth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>This person fought with aokun for nearly 100 moves. In the end, aokun transformed into his original form, a 500-meter long blood-red flood Dragon. His aura was soaring like a real Dragon. With one strike, he sent the Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect flying.</p><p>Another victory.</p><p>At this moment, the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect were both silent.</p><p>Could it be that even this round at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier was going to be won by aokun?</p><p>There were still a few people from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace who had awakened third-class divine bloodlines. However, even the Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect had been completely defeated. Wouldn’t they, who had third-class divine bloodlines, be defeated as well?</p><p>There were also a few people who had awakened fourth level divine level bloodlines, but their cultivation had all surpassed the sixth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Both sides fell silent. They had not expected such a terrifying monster to appear in the sky demon Valley. Furthermore, he was a new monster with a low cultivation.</p><p>On the list of top 1000 talents, geniuses of the same level as him already had extremely profound cultivation, far exceeding the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Aokun transformed back into his human form and looked around. Suddenly, he looked at Lu Ming and pointed at him, ” “You, weren’t you very arrogant? You injured a heaven’s favorite of my flood-dragon race and crippled his leg. Now, I challenge you. Do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>Following the direction of aokun’s finger, almost everyone looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Aokun was taking the initiative to challenge Lu Ming?</p><p>It was obvious that there was a grudge between the two of them.</p><p>“You want to challenge him? He’s not in our ten-person list!”</p><p>Di Feng frowned.</p><p>it’s fine. This time, it’s not counted in the competition. It’s a personal grudge between me and him!</p><p>Aokun shouted and looked at Lu Ming, ” “Brat, if you have the guts, come up and fight me. If you don’t, you can directly admit defeat and kneel down to beg for mercy!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, a cold smile on his face.</p><p>He was a little surprised, he didn’t expect aokun to challenge him.</p><p>However, this was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Originally, if he wasn’t in the list of 10, he wouldn’t be able to fight. He was still thinking that after the exchange, he would find trouble with aokun. Who knew that he would send himself up.</p><p>“I accept this battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>This surprised many people.</p><p>Aokun’s combat strength was obvious to all. He was extremely powerful. Even if he was one level higher than aokun, he would not be able to defeat aokun. Lu Ming actually dared to accept the challenge?</p><p>What was his confidence? Or was he provoked by aokun and couldn’t put down his face?</p><p>Wasn’t this too unwise?</p><p>Wasn’t he just looking for a beating by stepping onto the fighting stage?</p><p>“Haha, I didn’t think that you would really dare to go up the stage. In that case, do you dare to have a life and death battle with me?”</p><p>Aokun’s eyes flashed with greed.</p><p>Last time, ao Qian told him that there was something in Lu Ming’s body that had a strong attraction to him. It was very likely that it was Lu Ming’s bloodline, which made him very tempted.</p><p>Something that could make ao Qian unable to resist the temptation and attack was definitely not an ordinary sound. It might be able to increase the purity of his true dragon bloodline to another level.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had already restrained himself and he could not sense it, he still decided to find an opportunity to kill Lu Ming and seize his Blood Meridian.</p><p>Therefore, he proposed a life-and-death battle.</p><p>The surrounding people were also shocked.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming had a deep enmity with the flood Dragon Tribe. Otherwise, aokun would not have suggested a life-and-death battle.</p><p>A life-and-death battle was different from the sparring just now. In the previous battle, one would usually stop at a certain point, and at most, one would be seriously injured. There would not be any deaths. However, in a life-and-death battle, one party must die before it would end.</p><p>Would Lu Ming agree?</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but look forward to it.</p><p>“Life-and-death battle, life-and-death battle. Fatty, this whole flood dragon meat is enough for us to eat for ten days to half a month, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly smiled and looked at the fatty.</p><p>haha, that’s enough, that’s enough. If you eat sparingly, it should be enough!</p><p>The fatty grinned.</p><p>However, his eyes were solemn. He secretly transmitted a message to Lu Ming, telling him to be careful. He had felt aokun’s power just now. It was not a small matter.</p><p>The conversation between the two of them stunned the people around them.</p><p>Also, did Lu Ming agree to it?</p><p>“You’re looking for death, kid. Did you agree or not?” Aokun said coldly.</p><p>“There’s flood dragon meat to eat, why wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>alright, so you agree. Hehe, then go to hell!</p><p>Aokun’s laughter was filled with killing intent.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would really agree to it. He had only casually mentioned the Deathmatch. He initially thought that Lu Ming would definitely reject him out of fear. He was even thinking that if Lu Ming did not agree to it, he would find ways to find trouble with Lu Ming after the exchange.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would agree to it. He was overjoyed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He did not want to waste any more time. He strode forward like an awakened primordial beast and rushed toward Lu Ming. His huge fist was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming also took a step forward and threw a punch at the flood Dragon.</p><p>This shocked many people.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to use his fist to receive aokun’s fist.</p><p>Everyone had seen how powerful aokun’s fist was. Even a level six spirit weapon would be shattered by him. Lu Ming actually wanted to fight aokun head-on with his own fist. How was this possible? Wasn’t this courting death?</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>Even ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, Wang haoxian and the others widened their eyes and stared at the fighting ring with a hint of worry.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing was the calmest.</p><p>She had known Lu Ming for a long time and understood him the best. Since Lu Ming was so calm, it meant that he was confident.</p><p>Under the gaze of tens of thousands of eyes, the two fists finally collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion was heard, and a terrifying force swept out in all directions with the fist as the center. It formed a violent storm, and many people had to make a move to break the storm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The fighting ring shook violently.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a figure step on the ground and take seven steps back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
