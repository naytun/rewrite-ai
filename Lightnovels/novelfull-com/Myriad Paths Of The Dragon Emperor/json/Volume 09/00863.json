Inscriptions flew into the talisman paper one after another.</p><p>...</p><p>Grade 9 Lv 6 talismans were ten times more complicated than grade 8 Lv 6 talismans, so they needed more time.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming spent a full one and a half hours before he was successful.</p><p>The moment the inscription was successful, Lu Ming could clearly feel that in the dark, traces of inscription power descended from the inscription law and integrated into Lu Ming’s mental fire, strengthening it.</p><p>after refining a ninth grade sixth level, the power of inscription from the law of inscription is more than ten times stronger than that of a eighth grade sixth level!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile and he continued to refine.</p><p>As Lu Ming continued to refine, his inscribing speed became faster and faster.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was concentrating on inscribing the inscription talisman scroll, Bai chixue had returned to the cloud Peak Residence.</p><p>“This guy is inscribing talismans? Hmph, what kind of high level talisman scroll can this guy inscribe? Eh, that’s not right, this is a six extremes nine layer talisman scroll, a level 9 sword formation talisman!”</p><p>At first, Bai chixue was quite disdainful and just took a few glances at him. However, after a few glances, she could no longer look away and fixed her eyes on Lu Ming. She saw Lu Ming’s fingers waving in the air and his mouth opened so wide that a duck egg could be swallowed.</p><p>She could tell that Lu Ming was actually inscribing a Level-6 ninth-grade inscription talisman.</p><p>A ninth-grade, sixth-level inscription talisman scroll was already a top-tier, sixth-level inscription talisman scroll. Lu Ming’s inscription Dao had actually reached such a level?</p><p>She had only succeeded in inscribing a seventh grade sixth level inscription scroll for the first time under Lu Ming’s guidance.</p><p>Bai chixue was stunned. The more she looked, the more shocked she was.</p><p>his usage of mental fire is at the peak of the refinement realm. Also, how is his mental power so powerful and terrifying that he doesn’t use any materials? wait, how is his technique so exquisite and how is his inscribing speed so fast? ”</p><p>Bai chixue was in a daze. She kept mumbling, and the surprise and disbelief in her eyes were getting stronger.</p><p>Night had fallen but Lu Ming did not seem to be tired. After he finished carving one, he immediately carved the next one. His speed became faster and faster. Later on, he only needed half an hour to carve a Grade 9 Level 6 talisman scroll.</p><p>In one breath, Lu Ming inscribed fifteen pieces before he stopped and heaved a long sigh.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that his spiritual power was a little lacking, and his spiritual fire was a little dim. He needed to rest and recover.</p><p>“Eh, miss Bai, you’ve returned?”</p><p>Lu Ming finally noticed Bai chixue.</p><p>“Change … Abnormal!”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming in a daze and blurted out a few words.</p><p>“Ah, you met a pervert? Where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around.</p><p>“You, you’re a pervert!”</p><p>Bai chixue mumbled.</p><p>“Me?” Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“Who the hell are you? The Dao of inscription is so powerful?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes were wide open, her eyes scanning Lu Ming from head to toe.</p><p>“I’m tianyun!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Could it be that this insensitive lady had seen through him?</p><p>“I know all the paragons of the talisman Amulet sect. How come I’ve never seen you before? Don’t tell me?”</p><p>Bai chixue walked around Lu Ming and looked at him carefully, ” “Could it be that you’re a heaven’s favorite that master secretly nurtured? Or are you master’s illegitimate son? Yes, yes, that must be it. No wonder he asked you to live in Yun Peak House.”</p><p>The more Bai chixue talked, the more excited she became. Her eyes were shining as if she had discovered a big secret.</p><p>Lu Ming’s forehead was full of black lines. This lady’s imagination was too rich, right?</p><p>miss Bai, I’m neither secretly trained by your master, nor am I his illegitimate son. I’ve only just arrived at the talisman Amulet sect. Lu Ming explained helplessly.</p><p>“You’re not? That’s impossible!”</p><p>Bai chixue touched her chin and blinked her big eyes. Then, she rolled her eyes. No one knew what she was thinking.</p><p>After a while, Bai chixue’s face revealed an inexplicable smile, which made Lu Ming’s heart tighten. He did not know what this lady was up to.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ve suddenly realized that you’re not bad. How about this, I won’t object to you living in Yun Peak Residence from now on, but I have a condition. You have to teach me the Dao of inscription. I’ve realized that some of your techniques are even more exquisite than my master’s. Mm, it’s decided. You can rest for today, and you’ll start teaching me tomorrow!”</p><p>Bai chixue said with a smile and then ran back to her room.</p><p>Lu Ming was left alone in a daze.”I haven’t agreed to it yet!”</p><p>Just like that, as a condition for living in the cloud Peak House, Lu Ming took two hours out every day to guide Bai chixue in her cultivation of the inscription Dao.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Dao of inscription was passed down from Lian Cang. He was very experienced and sharp. He could always point out Bai chixue’s flaws and key points.</p><p>In just two days, Bai chixue’s understanding of the Dao of inscription had deepened. At the same time, Lu Ming became more and more mysterious in her heart.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ll bring you out for a walk today. You haven’t had a good look around since you came to the talisman Amulet sect, right? there are many good places in the talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>On the morning of the third day, Bai chixue pulled Lu Ming and ran out.</p><p>Lu Ming was also very curious and he followed Bai chixue.</p><p>Along the way, he saw many strange places. Some of them had beautiful scenery, while others were mysterious. It was an eye-opener for Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of them, a mountain peak appeared. At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge cave, and people were coming in and out.</p><p>that’s the myriad formations cave. There are countless formations in the cave, all of which were inscribed by the experts of the talisman sect in the past. Some of them are incomplete, while others are complete, for future generations to comprehend. Come, let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Bai chixue explained. Then, the two of them landed at the entrance of the cave.</p><p>There were guards at the entrance of the cave. However, Bai chixue’s identity was not ordinary. She was the little disciple of the talisman sect master, Bai Shijin. Naturally, she was able to enter without any obstacles.</p><p>As soon as he entered the cave, Lu Ming could feel a complicated aura permeating the air.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the cave and discovered that there were array diagrams inscribed on the walls on both sides of the cave.</p><p>There were all sorts of formation diagrams, each emitting a different aura.</p><p>At a glance, the cave was extremely deep and extended into the distance. On both sides of the cave, there were countless array diagrams.</p><p>Lu Ming began to read it carefully.</p><p>He recognized some of the formations, but he didn’t recognize most of them.</p><p>Moreover, there was a detailed explanation under each formation diagram.</p><p>There were even some incomplete formations that were extremely profound and left for future generations to comprehend and crack. Below were some of the insights gained from comprehending them.</p><p>“Good place, this is really a good place!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at more than ten array diagrams and felt that he had gained a lot.</p><p>This ten thousand formations cave was simply an endless wealth left behind by the ancestors of the talisman sect.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward as he watched.</p><p>Suddenly, he found a fork in the path beside the cave. He walked in, and there was only one array diagram in the fork.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When he saw this formation diagram, the heavens and earth seemed to be shaking. He realized that the surroundings had changed. He was in a boundless void. In the void, there were eight beams of sword Qi. The sword Qi was incomparably huge, like pillars that held up the sky. They descended from the sky, suppressing in all directions and destroying everything.</p><p>The extremely powerful sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming. It was terrifyingly powerful, just like when he faced Martial Emperor Di Yi in ninedragons.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He used all his strength to resist, but it was useless. The powerful sword Qi destroyed everything and slashed down on his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
