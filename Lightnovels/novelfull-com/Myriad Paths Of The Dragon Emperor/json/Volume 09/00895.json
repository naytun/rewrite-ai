After all, they were friends.</p><p>...</p><p>“Let’s go to Mount Liangyi!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the three of them headed to the yin and yang mountain. After a while, they arrived at the mountain. With Lu Ming’s token, the three of them entered the mountain easily.</p><p>Lu Ming first returned to the platform and returned the token to the elder. Then, he brought the fatty and ruan Tingting with him and flew towards Cloud Peak House.</p><p>“Nest, you’re hiding a mistress in your Golden House!”</p><p>The moment he arrived at the cloud Peak House and saw Bai chixue, the fatty shouted.</p><p>He did not call Lu Ming by his real name. He knew that Lu Ming was using a fake name.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and kicked.</p><p>Bai chixue’s face turned red.</p><p>Seeing Bai chixue’s embarrassed look, the Fatty’s eyes were wide open. He then looked at Lu Ming with admiration and said, ” brother, I’m impressed. I really admire you. Wherever you go, you have beautiful women accompanying you. You even live together!</p><p>“But aren’t you too fickle? How can I let miss Xie down? look at me, I only have Tingting in my heart!”</p><p>After she finished speaking, she even blinked her small eyes and looked at ruan Tingting ingratiatingly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming kicked the Fatty’s body and the Fatty’s fat body flew out.</p><p>“Chi Xue, these two are my friends, fatty Kong Jin and ruan Ting Ting!”</p><p>Lu Ming started to introduce them to Bai chixue.</p><p>Since they were all young people, they got to know each other after fooling around for a while. Lu Ming had arranged a courtyard for fatty and ruan Tingting on a mountain near Yun Peak House.</p><p>In the following days, Mount Liangyi became lively.</p><p>As the battle of Providence neared, almost all the paragons came out of seclusion and adjusted their mentality to prepare for the battle of Providence.</p><p>Even the other 13 zongzis had appeared and ended their seclusion.</p><p>Time passed day by day. Two days before the battle of Providence began, Bai Shijin sent someone to invite Lu Ming to meet him.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at the talisman Amulet sect’s meeting hall and saw Bai Shijin, du songjue, Meng Chong, and the other elders of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>In the middle of the hall, there were 13 young men.</p><p>There were men and women among the thirteen young men, and all of them had extraordinary bearings. One look and one could tell that they were Dragons and phoenixes among men.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered, the thirteen young men and women looked at him in unison.</p><p>Some were curious, some were peaceful, some were friendly, but there were also some who were not friendly.</p><p>these should be the other 13 zongzi candidates!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he sized up the other party curiously.</p><p>These 13 people were the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents. Each and every one of them was extraordinary and stood at the peak of the eastern barren territory.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve come!”</p><p>Bai Shijin laughed.</p><p>“Tian Yun pays his respects to the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted in front of the mountain.</p><p>mm, you guys should get to know each other. He’s tianyun!</p><p>Bai Shijin nodded.</p><p>“Junior Brother tianyun, I’ve long heard of your name!”</p><p>A young man stepped forward with a gentle smile on his face.</p><p>This young man had a head of silver hair that was casually let down and reached his waist. He was very handsome and always had a gentle smile on his face, which easily gave people a good impression of him.</p><p>His body was constantly emitting a mysterious aura, as if he did not belong to the mortal world.</p><p>The most peculiar thing about him was his eyes. His eyes were silver in color, and he had two pupils. Each of his eyes had two pupils, and they looked extremely evil.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He thought of someone.</p><p>Silver hair heavenly eye, illusion reality!</p><p>He was ranked eighth on the list of top 1000 talents and was the only one from the talisman sect to make it into the top 10. He was known as an unparalleled genius and the number one Alchemist among the younger generation in the East barren.</p><p>He was extremely talented, and it was said that his heavenly pupils could see through all formations and inscriptions.</p><p>cough, cough, cough!</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, Bai Shijin coughed and said, huanzhen, don’t call tianyun Junior Brother. You can just call each other by name!</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Huan Zhen and the other heaven’s favorites all looked at Bai Shijin in surprise.</p><p>However, Bai Shijin’s face was slightly red, and the other elders were also a little embarrassed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was funny.</p><p>He understood what Bai Shijin and the others meant. Lu Ming’s master was Lian Cang, who was very senior. Bai Shijin had to call him uncle-master.</p><p>Now, Huan Zhen called Lu Ming his Junior Brother. Was he not climbing over Bai Shijin’s head and taking advantage of him?</p><p>He knew Lu Ming very well, but Huan Zhen and the rest did not. They looked at each other.</p><p>alright, you young people get to know each other faster. Let’s talk about serious business first!</p><p>Bai Shijin coughed a few times and changed the topic.</p><p>the battle for Providence is about to begin. However, all of you should know that out of the four major powers in the eastern barren territory, our Talisman Amulet sect is the weakest. The number of geniuses is decreasing year by year, while the other powers such as the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect are getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>in the past thousand years, our Talisman Amulet sect has always been at the bottom in every battle for Providence. We have been ruthlessly suppressed and the Providence we obtain has become less and less. The strength of our sect has also become weaker and weaker. Therefore, this time, the first thing you must do is to be United. You must not fight among yourselves. You are already weak. If you fight among yourselves, the final result is very likely to be a complete annihilation!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s eyes were bright as he warned her seriously.</p><p>“This disciple will remember!”</p><p>Huan Zhen, Lu Ming, and the rest agreed with serious expressions.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Bai Shijin nodded in satisfaction and continued, ” the battle of Providence takes place once every 20 years. However, the area that you enter each time is different. It’s really wondrous. However, there’s one thing in common, which is that every battle contains a great opportunity. When you obtain the opportunity, you will also obtain Providence. This is your chance. If you can obtain a great opportunity from this, you might be able to suppress the geniuses of your generation. In the future, you will dominate the eastern barren territory and lead the talisman Amulet sect to rise!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice was full of temptation, causing all the young people present to clench their fists and be filled with anticipation.</p><p>However, Bai Shijin’s tone immediately changed, ” however, the battle of Kismet is also known as the burial ground of the chosen. Every time it happens, a large number of chosen will die. However, this world is just that cruel. The strong will become stronger, and the weak will only be stepped over by the bones. So, you must be mentally prepared!</p><p>However, the fourteen of them, including Lu Ming, had determined looks in their eyes and did not waver at all.</p><p>They were all peerless heaven’s pride experts. Since they had embarked on the path of cultivation, they would advance courageously until they reached the peak. There was no reason for them to retreat.</p><p>They were full of confidence in themselves.</p><p>“Good, it’s good that you have confidence!”</p><p>Du songjue, who had been silent the entire time, finally spoke.</p><p>“I have one more thing to tell you!”</p><p>Du songjue muttered to himself for a moment and continued,”Master Lian Cang once said that the world we are in is called the primordial realm. The primordial realm is vast and boundless. Not to mention Imperial path powerhouses, even stronger existences don’t know the boundary either!”</p><p>and the divine wilderness continent we are in is just a corner of the primordial realm. It’s just a drop in the ocean. In the boundless ocean, there are many other continents like the divine wilderness continent. Some might be smaller than the divine wilderness continent, but some are even bigger. There are even continents that are hundreds or thousands of times bigger than the divine wilderness continent. Cultivation is at its peak, and experts are as common as clouds!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
