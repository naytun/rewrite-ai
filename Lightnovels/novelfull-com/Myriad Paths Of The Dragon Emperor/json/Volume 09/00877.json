Then, the painting disappeared from the wall in a flash.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>That person sighed. He had chosen the wrong person, and the picture disappeared, becoming the first person to be eliminated.</p><p>Seeing that someone had been eliminated by the wrong call, the others became even more careful and didn’t dare to rashly make a move.</p><p>However, the competition had a time limit of half an hour. Once the time was up, those who had less than ten points would also be eliminated.</p><p>Some people were deep in thought, but some people were still very fast. It was as if they didn’t need to think. Their fingers continued to point out, and one formation after another was found.</p><p>These people were all heaven’s pride level figures.</p><p>a heaven’s favorite is indeed a heaven’s favorite. His eyesight is extraordinary. He was able to identify a formation just by pointing at it casually. How amazing!</p><p>of course. An Alchemist’s eyesight is very important. If you don’t have good eyesight, you won’t be able to become a heaven’s favorite!</p><p>look, Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, and Meng Jia are the fastest. They’ve already found 20 formations without much consideration.</p><p>this is shocking. Look, the other chosen have also found more than ten spell formations. The first round of the test is not difficult for them at all!</p><p>“Eh? Look, that tianyun is so fast, he’s actually found more than ten!”</p><p>“Could it be that his Dao of inscription is also so amazing?”</p><p>Some people were discussing. In the end, they looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>that’s normal. The strength of the tianyun martial arts shows that he’s very intelligent. Even if he helps with the path of inscription, he won’t be too bad. It’s normal for him to pass the first round!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Some of the older generation spoke, and the others nodded.</p><p>During this period, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other elders watched with interest. However, their gazes were mostly on Lu Ming.</p><p>They were very clear that Lu Ming’s first five levels were at the perfect stage.</p><p>However, mental energy fire alone was not enough to master the Dao of inscription. One’s eyesight, the use of mental energy fire, the number of inscriptions and arrays one had mastered, and the strength of one’s understanding were all very important.</p><p>If he only had a strong mental fire and nothing else, he would be useless.</p><p>It was like a person who had great strength but did not know any martial arts techniques or battle experience. Then, his strength would not be able to exert its original effect.</p><p>The competition this time was also a test for Lu Ming. Otherwise, why would all of them appear in a competition between the younger generation?</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he continued to point his fingers. He was neither fast nor slow. He maintained a uniform movement. It did not seem to be very fast, slower than Ji mai and the rest.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had found twenty formations. However, his speed was still the same, neither fast nor slow.</p><p>In the arena, there were people who continuously made mistakes and were eliminated.</p><p>There were fewer and fewer people.</p><p>In the end, many people didn’t dare to make a move. They stared at the picture with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>Some people found more than ten formations, and without full confidence, they would not dare to make a move.</p><p>If there were more than ten people, they could already pass and enter the next round. If they made another move and pointed out the wrong number, they would really vomit blood.</p><p>Slowly, many people stopped and looked at the others.</p><p>At this moment, Ji mai, Yan Tongtong, and Meng Jia had already found more than 50 formations.</p><p>At this point, their speed had already started to slow down. Sometimes, they needed to think for a while before pointing out a finger.</p><p>As for Guan Rong and the other God-tier heaven’s favorites, he had found more than 40 of them. However, his speed was much slower. He had to think for a while before he could find one.</p><p>Sunrise, in particular, had already found 43 formations. He was frowning and his eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the picture on the White jade wall, but he couldn’t find the 44th formation.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming’s speed was still at a moderate pace. There was no change in his speed compared to before. He pointed with his finger continuously and the number of arrays he found kept increasing.</p><p>Thirty, forty, fifty …</p><p>Very soon, the number of arrays that Lu Ming had found had exceeded fifty. However, the speed did not slow down and it was still increasing.</p><p>At this moment, many people’s gazes were attracted to Lu Ming.</p><p>guys, look! Tianyun has already found more than fifty formations, and it’s still increasing!</p><p>“What’s going on? He’s not slowing down at all, he’s so fast, he’s almost catching up to Ji mai and the others!”</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The surrounding discussions affected even more people. Countless eyes looked at Lu Ming. At first, they were puzzled, but slowly, they turned into shock.</p><p>When the number of formations Ji mai found reached 60, Lu Ming’s number also reached 60.</p><p>However, the number of formations that Lu Ming found exceeded sixty and he became the first. This was shocking.</p><p>No one had expected that Lu Ming could actually find so many arrays.</p><p>The key was that the speed of his finger was still maintained at a constant speed, as if he didn’t need to think.</p><p>At that moment, even the geniuses who were taking part in the competition below the White jade wall had their eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>Sunrise’s eyes were bloodshot. He pondered for a long time but could not find forty-four arrays. When he heard the movement beside him, he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>With one look, his pupils suddenly widened, revealing a look of disbelief, and he shrieked, ” “How is that possible? How could he have found so many? It’s impossible!”</p><p>He simply couldn’t believe it, and didn’t dare to believe it.</p><p>Slowly, even Ji mai, Yan Tong, and Meng Jia stopped searching. They looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming was still not slow. He pointed his fingers at a uniform speed and one by one, the arrays were found.</p><p>“This … This tianyun couldn’t possibly be able to find all the formations, right? That’s too terrifying. Look, he’s not even slowing down!”</p><p>I know now. From the start, he maintained a speed that was neither too fast nor too slow. That way, he would have enough time to think and identify. However, mai Ji and the others were too fast at the start, so they would have to slow down to think later on. I think tianyun will stop soon, so he can’t be as strong as mai Ji!</p><p>Someone voiced out his thoughts, causing many to nod in agreement.</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and a few others had faint smiles on their faces. They were very calm, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>However, as the number of arrays that Lu Ming found increased, his speed did not seem to slow down at all. The number of arrays that he found continued to increase.</p><p>Very quickly, it exceeded 70, and the number was increasing at a constant rate.</p><p>71,72 …</p><p>Those who thought that Lu Ming would stop immediately were dumbfounded and their faces were flushed red.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming. They stared at him and wanted to see how many Lu Ming could find.</p><p>When Lu Ming clicked on the seventy-sixth option, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at his surroundings.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>The crowd that was watching heaved a long sigh of relief. Lu Ming finally stopped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
