Ji mai, Yan Tong Tong, Meng Jia, and H Ming are so fast! They’ve reached the third level so quickly!</p><p>...</p><p>the strength of the four of them is already stronger than the others by a level!</p><p>“Who is this H Ming? I’ve never heard of him before, but he’s actually this strong?”</p><p>I heard that he was a disciple secretly trained by an elder!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the Jade tablet, observing the changes in the names on it.</p><p>At this moment, the names of Ji mai and the other three appeared at the top, shining brightly.</p><p>As time passed, the number of levels they passed continued to increase.</p><p>Very quickly, Ji mai and the other three made it past the tenth floor.</p><p>At this moment, some people had already been eliminated.</p><p>The worst was to make it to the fifth level, some were at the sixth level, the seventh level …</p><p>Starting from the fifth level, there were people being eliminated on every level. The thousand formation Pagoda flickered with light as Talisman Amulet sect disciples were transported out.</p><p>The people who were teleported out sighed.</p><p>Soon, Ji mai and the other three passed level twelve.</p><p>From the 13th level onwards, the speed of the four of them slowed down.</p><p>That was because from the 13th level onwards, the difficulty would increase by a huge margin.</p><p>Two hours later, more than 430 out of the 500 people who had entered were eliminated. They had not passed level 12. The elimination rate was terrifyingly high.</p><p>Only 60-odd people had passed level 12.</p><p>After passing through the 12th level, there were also people who were constantly being transported out. The number of people who remained in the thousand formations tower was getting fewer and fewer.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ji mai had already reached the 23rd floor.</p><p>Yan Tongtong, Meng Jia, and H Ming had also reached the 22nd floor.</p><p>Below, there were rooms on the 20th and 19th floor.</p><p>what level do you think Ji mai can reach? ”</p><p>I estimate that at the 26th and 27th level, the difficulty will increase sharply for every 12 levels. From the 25th level onwards, the difficulty will be even greater!</p><p>that’s right. I also think that Ji mai can only make it to level 27 at most. Yan Tongtong and the other two will be even worse off!</p><p>yes, that’s about it. Even among the 13 zongzis candidates, only a few of them can pass the 30th level and above in the intermediate difficulty.</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people were teleported out.</p><p>In the end, only Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, Meng Jia, and H Ming were left.</p><p>At this moment, Ji mai had already reached the 25th floor while the other three were on the 24th floor.</p><p>After reaching the 25th floor, Ji Mai’s speed was like a turtle crawling. He was much slower and was stuck on the 25th floor. He was unable to reach the 26th floor.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Yan Tongtong and the other two to reach the 25th floor.</p><p>An hour later, the number behind Ji Mai’s name changed from 25 to 26.</p><p>Ji mai had reached the 26th floor.</p><p>This time, after two hours, Yan Tongtong and the other two reached the 26th floor.</p><p>This time, the wait was even longer.</p><p>After three hours, Ji mai finally reached the 27th floor.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all cultivators. They could wait for months, let alone hours.</p><p>This time, it didn’t take long for Ji mai to appear on the 27th level of the all formation Pagoda.</p><p>It seemed to be a coincidence. Less than two minutes after Ji Ziming stepped out, a bright light flashed on the 20th floor. Yan Tong, Meng Jia, and H Ming were all teleported out.</p><p>The three of them could only make it to the 26th floor.</p><p>alright, now that the first batch of people has come out, the next batch will continue!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One by one, they rushed in.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry. He watched with great interest.</p><p>After the second group of people entered, the names on the Jade tablet all changed to the names of the second group.</p><p>Time flew by, and night soon fell.</p><p>Inscriptions glowed around the White jade square, forming pillars of light that brightened the White jade square as if it were daytime.</p><p>Soon, everyone was teleported out.</p><p>In the second group, there was no one who was particularly amazing. The highest was only at level 25.</p><p>Sunrise was also in the second group. He only made it to the twenty-fourth level before he was teleported out.</p><p>now, the third batch. The rest of you, go in!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>The last batch had 516 people.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai chixue followed the crowd and rushed into the thousand formations tower.</p><p>Countless gazes were fixed on the Jade tablet.</p><p>tianyun has entered. I wonder how many levels he’ll be able to reach? ”</p><p>tianyun’s array analysis is very powerful. Challenging the all formation Pagoda is related to the array analysis. I think his results won’t be bad and he should be able to pass level 20!</p><p>“After the twentieth level? You value him that much?”</p><p>that’s right. He’s really good at identifying arrays. I guess he can find the weaknesses of many arrays. As long as his Dao of inscription is not too bad, his results in the thousand formations tower will not be too bad!</p><p>you’re right. However, in the end, he still needs to rely on his strength to pass the all formations Pagoda. The 24th level is his limit. It’s almost impossible for him to pass the 25th level!</p><p>Many people expressed their opinions.</p><p>There was a flash of light and the surrounding environment changed. Lu Ming found himself in a Valley.</p><p>As soon as he appeared, formations appeared around the valley. The formations condensed into more than a dozen combat swords and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>they’re all low-grade level six formations!</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and understood everything.</p><p>With a step, inscriptions spread out from the ground and entered the formations. The formations collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>The surroundings changed again. This time, they were in the middle of a forest.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that he had already reached the second level.</p><p>In the forest, formations appeared as well. This time, Lu Ming was faster. He took a step forward and runes appeared. He destroyed the weak points of the formations and caused them to collapse.</p><p>The people outside were right about one thing. Lu Ming had sharp eyes. He could tell the weaknesses of these arrays with one look and could break them easily.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was incomparably fast. He passed through the levels one by one. The environment and the array techniques that appeared on each level were different, but it was not difficult for Lu Ming.</p><p>His speed was like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>so fast! Tianyun’s speed is so fast! He’s already reached the tenth level!</p><p>Outside, someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the third group of people, Lu Ming’s speed was far ahead.</p><p>“His eyesight is indeed extraordinary. The level of the array below the 12th floor is not high and is relatively simple. It is not difficult for him to break it. But after the 13th floor, his speed will definitely slow down.”</p><p>that’s right. After the thirteenth level, it’s impossible to rely on your eyesight alone!</p><p>look, he has passed the 12th Palace!</p><p>Someone cried out in shock. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the Jade tablet, on the first place, tianyun’s name.</p><p>The name was displayed according to the name recorded in the identity token. The identity token recorded by Lu Ming in the talisman Amulet sect was called tianyun.</p><p>Very quickly, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>This was because after Lu Ming reached the thirteenth level, his speed did not slow down. He was still as fast as he was on the previous twelve levels.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
