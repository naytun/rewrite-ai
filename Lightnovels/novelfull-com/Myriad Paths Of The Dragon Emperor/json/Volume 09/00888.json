Roar!</p><p>...</p><p>The puppet’s roar jolted everyone’s spirits, and they recovered from their shock.</p><p>“Tianyun, I’ve lost!”</p><p>Yan Tong’s shock turned into a deep sigh.</p><p>At the scene, many people also sighed in their hearts.</p><p>It was normal for Yan Tongtong to lose. It was not that Yan Tongtong was not strong, but Lu Ming was simply too monstrous. The array that he had mastered could even restrain him.</p><p>After Yan Tonghua admitted defeat, he turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Anything else?” Yan Tongtong turned around.</p><p>“Your puppet!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and pointed at the fifteen puppets.</p><p>Yan Tongtong was stunned for a moment, then he cupped his fists and said, ” “Many thanks!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the puppet and walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad, not bad!”</p><p>In the sky, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and a few elders nodded.</p><p>He even returned the puppet to Yan Tonghua after he won. This proved that Lu Ming was not a person who would covet petty gains. He was upright and honest.</p><p>Previously, he had defeated Feng tai and subdued Feng Tai’s puppet because Feng tai had offended Lu Ming in the past and held a grudge against him.</p><p>Since there was a grudge, of course he had to teach her a lesson.</p><p>“Tianyun wins this battle!”</p><p>Meng Chong’s announcement won him a round of cheers.</p><p>“Tianyun, tianyun, I love you!”</p><p>A loud cheer came from somewhere, and everyone looked over to see a group of young women.</p><p>The girls ‘eyes lit up as they looked at the elegant Lu Ming on the fighting ring and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming had a delicate and pretty face to begin with. In addition to his dual cultivation in inscription and martial arts, he had a special temperament and a unique charm. To young women, he was very attractive.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had displayed his unparalleled talent. Naturally, he attracted the attention of a large number of young women.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. He walked down the fighting ring, causing countless young men around him to cast envious, jealous, and hateful gazes at him.</p><p>After Lu Ming came down, Ji mai and Meng Jia stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The scene quieted down, and everyone’s eyes returned to the fighting ring.</p><p>Ji Mai’s ranking on the list of top 1000 talents was higher than Meng Jia’s, but that was a few years ago. Now, it was hard to say who was stronger and who was weaker. Countless people were curious, wondering if Meng Jia could fight Ji mai.</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them started fighting.</p><p>Meng Jia was also a prodigy of the puppet sect. She summoned 15 puppets in one go, which were all at tier 10 of Level 6, just like Yan Tongtong.</p><p>However, Meng Jia’s puppets were much smaller. They were puppets that looked like snow-white Eagles.</p><p>The snow-white Condor was emitting a cold aura. Its wings were like ice blades, dancing in the air and vaguely forming an array. Then, it slashed at Ji mai.</p><p>Ji Mai’s face was calm. He took a few steps and a formation appeared on the ground. A sharp golden sword light burst out from the formation and slashed at the snow-white Eagles.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the same time, talismans appeared around him. As his mind power flowed, the talismans opened, and an endless golden light exploded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering roar suddenly rang out in the fighting ring.</p><p>The snow-white Condor puppet’s wings were like blades as it continuously collided with the golden sword radiance, causing violent rumbles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a wave of Ji Mai’s hand, a row of inscription scrolls flew out. After they were activated, the sky was filled with golden sword light. They descended from the sky and slashed down at Meng Jia.</p><p>Meng Jia shouted and waved her hands. Three puppets flew back and formed a formation, protecting her. Ji mai couldn’t rush in at all.</p><p>For a moment, the two of them seemed to be evenly matched.</p><p>The battle lasted for more than ten minutes.</p><p>“It seems like Ji mai can’t defeat Meng Jia!”</p><p>“That’s right, the two of them are evenly matched!”</p><p>Meng Jia’s strength is definitely not weaker than Yan Tongtong’s, but she can’t be stronger either. Does that mean that tianyun will be able to obtain first place this time? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. Ji mai is from talisman sect. Tianyun can’t restrain him. It’s hard to say if he hasn’t fought him before.</p><p>Sounds of discussion could be heard in the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming was also looking at it seriously. He frowned slightly and his gaze fell on Ji mai.</p><p>He had a feeling that Ji mai wasn’t that simple. Ji mai gave him a dangerous feeling. Ji mai still had a killer move that he hadn’t used.</p><p>At this moment, Ji mai waved his hand and all the scrolls that had not been activated were kept away.</p><p>The others were stunned. Ji mai kept the inscription scroll. Was he going to admit defeat?</p><p>Or was he afraid that if he continued to fight, he would consume too many inscription scrolls and lose more than he gained?</p><p>The puppets of the puppet sect could fight for a long time. The talisman sect used inscription scrolls. If they could not defeat their opponent in one fell swoop, they would suffer great losses. It was normal for Ji mai to admit defeat after a long battle.</p><p>“Ji mai, are you going to admit defeat?”</p><p>Meng Jia said.</p><p>“Fight!” Ji Mai’s answer was simple.</p><p>“Then I won’t be polite!”</p><p>Meng Jia continued to control the puppet and pounced at Ji mai.</p><p>When Meng Jia’s puppet got close to Ji mai, Ji Mai’s hand was like a sword. He slashed out and a dazzling sword light burst out, as if it could split the sky in half.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword light accurately hit a large Condor puppet. One of the puppet’s wings was cut into two, and it was sent flying far away.</p><p>At the same time, Ji Mai’s palm struck out and the sword light was sent out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Several Eagle puppets were sent flying in succession, suffering serious injuries.</p><p>What a terrifying power. A class 10 lv 6 puppet was extremely hard, but it was cut in half by the sword light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. martial arts technique. No, it’s a formation. I’m carving the formation with my body!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked. His gaze fell on Ji mai.</p><p>At first, he thought it was a martial skill, but after a closer look, he knew it wasn’t.</p><p>At this moment, inscriptions appeared on Ji Mai’s skin, forming a mysterious array. It gave off a terrifying aura that was beyond the level of the spirit sea.</p><p>“Using my body to inscribe the formation, I’m inscribing the formation with my body!”</p><p>Many people cried out in shock.</p><p>it is indeed a formation carved with one’s body. Ji mai should be carving a level-seven killing formation, the golden light ten thousand killing formation!</p><p>An elder spoke.</p><p>“He’s actually using his body to inscribe a formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Using one’s own body to inscribe a formation, as the name suggested, was to inscribe the formation into one’s physical body and completely integrate it with one’s physical body. This would make the physical body itself a killing formation.</p><p>This was completely different from the quintessential essence explosion formation that Lu Ming had inscribed on his body in the past to conceal his aura.</p><p>The arrays that Lu Ming inscribed were all auxiliary arrays. They were only temporarily left on the surface of the body. After a period of time, when the energy was exhausted, they would naturally disappear.</p><p>However, carving a formation with one’s body was different. It was to completely carve the formation into the depths of one’s body and merge it with the body. The body was the formation, and the formation was the body.</p><p>This was extremely terrifying. As long as his mental energy fire was strong, his physical body could unleash the power of the array at any time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
