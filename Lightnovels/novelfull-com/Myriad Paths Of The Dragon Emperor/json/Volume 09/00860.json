You can also take a look around the surrounding area.</p><p>...</p><p>Bai Shijin ordered.</p><p>Bai chixue stomped her feet and turned to leave without looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose with a bitter smile. He really wanted to suggest that Bai Shijin arrange another place for him to stay. It would be more peaceful to stay alone. However, he thought that the Yun Peak House must be very special. It must have been specially arranged by Bai Shijin. Lu Ming did not say anything. He bid farewell to Yan kuangtu and Bai Shijin and left with Bai chixue.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Bai chixue left, Yan kuangtu looked at Bai Shijin with a faint smile and said, ” “Bai Shijin, you’re really a sly old fox. What are you planning by arranging for such a beautiful disciple to stay with Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Bai Shijin coughed a few times and blushed, ” “Brother Yan, you’re thinking too much. Lu Ming is a genius. I just want my disciple to learn more from Lu Ming. As for the sparks between young people, that’s all up to fate. Hahaha!”</p><p>Bai Shijin laughed awkwardly.</p><p>……</p><p>The meeting hall was at the center of the Tai Chi Yin Yang fish. Lu Ming followed Bai chixue out of the meeting hall and walked toward the yin fish.</p><p>Along the way, Bai chixue pouted and did not say a word. She did not even look at Lu Ming as she continued to fly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He could only brace himself and follow.</p><p>Liangyi mountain was very vast and occupied a large area.</p><p>There were countless mountains, lakes, and blessed lands.</p><p>The two of them flew for more than 100000 miles, crossing countless mountains and rivers along the way. Finally, they flew toward a peak shrouded in clouds and mist.</p><p>On the peak of the mountain, there was a courtyard that was exquisitely built.</p><p>This was Yun Peak House.</p><p>“What a wonderful place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up the moment he landed on the mountain. He could feel the mental energy fire throbbing in his sea of consciousness. It seemed that he could easily sense the existence of the inscription laws and absorb the inscription power from them to upgrade his mental energy fire.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed. The world was really wonderful. There were all kinds of strange places.</p><p>Some places had spiritual eyes and extremely dense spiritual energy.</p><p>Some places had eyes of Dao, which could help him understand the essence realm of heaven and earth more clearly.</p><p>However, there was the eye of inscription here, which could easily sense the laws of inscription and absorb the power of inscription.</p><p>No wonder Bai Shijin had arranged for him to come here. He also hoped that he could improve faster before the battle of Providence.</p><p>Bai chixue opened the door and walked in, followed by Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as he entered, Lu Ming noticed that there were some platforms in the courtyard. On the platforms, there were various materials.</p><p>Lu Ming took one look and knew that they were the materials to refine various runes and inscription scrolls.</p><p>It seemed that Bai chixue had been making runes here.</p><p>“That room is yours!”</p><p>Bai chixue pointed at a room on the left and spoke for the first time. Her voice was clear and pleasant to the ears.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Also, let me tell you, the things in this courtyard are all things that I used to make inscription scrolls. If you don’t understand, don’t touch them, understand?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>She had never seen Lu Ming in the talisman Amulet sect. Among the paragons of the talisman Amulet sect, there was no one named Lu Ming. She did not know where her master had found this person. He was so important to her that he even allowed him to stay in Yun Peak House.</p><p>However, in her heart, since he was not a Paragon of the talisman Amulet sect, his Dao of inscription would not be any better. She was really afraid that Lu Ming would damage her materials and disturb her cultivation.</p><p>“Alright, I won’t touch it!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He could not be bothered to argue with a young lady.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming looked around and walked into the room on the left, closing the door.</p><p>“Hmph! I’m cultivating here alone, and I’m free. Master even arranged for someone to come in, and he’s a man. I have to think of a way to make him leave on his own!”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming’s door, her eyes darting around.</p><p>“Yes, I did. He just came here, so he must not know anything. I just ignored him after that. What did he ask me? I already said I don’t know. Let’s just ignore him and see how long he can stay.”</p><p>With that thought in mind, Bai chixue smiled and felt much better. She started to study the inscription scrolls in the yard.</p><p>this place is indeed wondrous. My mental energy fire is about to make a breakthrough. Let’s try the effects!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat cross-legged and activated the meditation.</p><p>Immediately, his mind seemed to pass through layers of void and enter the inscription law. The surrounding inscription power was endless and very clear. It was as if Lu Ming could quickly absorb it with a single thought.</p><p>He immediately started cultivating. Wisps of the power of inscription passed through the void and landed in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. They were absorbed by his mental energy fire and Lu Ming’s mental energy fire slowly became more vigorous.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, four blue Spirit lamps were burning fiercely. They had already reached their limit and were only one step away from lighting five.</p><p>this is amazing. I can absorb the power of inscription dozens of times faster than other places. It’s even more amazing with my meditation of the underworld!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and he put in more effort in his cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day and a night had passed.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the flames of the four blue Spirit lamps were already at their peak. Suddenly, a blue flame appeared in the fifth spirit lamp and jumped in the air.</p><p>The fifth lamp of spirit was lit.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes after a while.</p><p>five Blue Spirit lamps. Now, my spirit energy is boundless. I wonder what level it has reached.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Then, he waved his fingers and started to inscribe in the air.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared and glowed as if they were going to be carved into the space. In an instant, an array was formed and embedded in the void, shining with a faint light.</p><p>Unfortunately, after ten breaths, the formation collapsed.</p><p>there’s still a gap. My mind power can’t inscribe formations in the air yet. Perhaps I’ll be able to do it if I light one or two more lamps!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>If this was known by others, their jaws would probably drop.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to inscribe an array in the void. One had to be a rank 7 true inscription refinement master, which was equivalent to a spirit embryo realm expert.</p><p>Furthermore, a true inscription Alchemist who had just broken through to rank 7 would not be able to do so. The array carved in the air could not be left there for long. Only an expert among rank 7 alchemists could do it.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only a sixth-level Alchemist, but the array he inscribed could already stay in the void for a short time. He believed that if his mental strength was stronger, he could really inscribe an array in the void.</p><p>This was extremely shocking.</p><p>A level-six inscriber could inscribe an array in the void, and not many people had been able to do it since ancient times.</p><p>Once it was achieved, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase rapidly and the restrictions of the Dao of inscription would be even less.</p><p>with my current combat strength, I’m still far from being able to win first place in the battle of Providence. It’s unrealistic to rush up in either one of them in a short time. Martial arts and the Dao of inscription must advance together and cooperate with each other to exert great power. Only then will I have a greater chance of winning. The most important thing now is to raise the bloodline of the nine Dragons to the level of divine bloodline again.</p><p>the talisman Amulet sect focuses on the Dao of inscription. I believe that there will be a lot of demonic beast blood essence. I’ll go and buy some first!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming got up, pushed the door open and walked out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
