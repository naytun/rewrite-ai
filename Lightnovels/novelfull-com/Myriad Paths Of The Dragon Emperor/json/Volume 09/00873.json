It also formed an arrow and shot toward the arrow in front of him.</p><p>...</p><p>However, just as the two arrows were about to collide, the incoming arrow suddenly turned nimbly and dodged Lu Ming’s arrow. It continued to shoot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to make a turn but it was too late. He could only condense more mental energy fire to form an arrow and shoot it at the arrow.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The arrow was finally intercepted by Lu Ming and offset.</p><p>However, at this moment, more arrows suddenly condensed in the surroundings and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These arrows were extremely agile. Like a nimble snake, they danced in the air and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the mental fire but he could not keep up with the speed of the arrows. He could only release more mental fire to block the arrows with numbers.</p><p>However, this greatly depleted Lu Ming’s mental energy fire. Soon, his mental energy fire was depleted.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>With his mental energy fire depleted, Lu Ming could no longer block the arrows. He was instantly hit by the arrows, and a tearing pain came from his head. His vision turned black, and in the next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had returned to the door of light he had entered earlier.</p><p>it’s only medium difficulty and it’s already so difficult. It seems like I’m really not that good at using mental fire? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and stepped into the light door again. The next moment, he was back in the void.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Around him, more blue arrows formed and shot toward him.</p><p>It was said that in the spirit tempering Hall, the amount and quality of the spirit Fire condensed from the arrows were exactly the same as the person who entered. In order to completely block these arrows, one had to condense one’s own Spirit Fire. Each Spirit Fire had to be equal to the amount of the attacking Spirit Fire. Furthermore, one’s Spirit Fire had to intercept one of the other’s Spirit Fire. This way, one could finally completely offset the attacking Spirit Fire and pass the test.</p><p>As long as the mental energy fire that he condensed was thicker and stronger than the other party’s, the number of arrows that he could condense would definitely be less than the other party’s. Just like Lu Ming previously, he used violent attacks to block some of the arrows in the front. However, very soon, his mental energy would be depleted and he could only be beaten up at the back.</p><p>However, these arrows were too agile. It was too difficult to block them perfectly. One had to have extremely precise control over one’s mental fire. At the same time, one’s control of it had to be very impressive in order to completely block them.</p><p>Lu Ming was fully focused, controlling his mental energy fire to block the arrows that were coming from all directions.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming held on for a longer time. The arrows that were shot at him were too agile. Lu Ming could not keep up with the speed of the other party by controlling one arrow alone. He could only release a large number of mental energy arrows to surround them. Soon, his mental energy was depleted again. The arrows pierced his body and Lu Ming was teleported out of the door of light.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the door of light again and again, training the use of his mental energy fire.</p><p>Slowly, he became more and more familiar with the use of his mental fire. He could barely keep up with his opponent’s speed and offset the arrows by controlling his own mental fire.</p><p>However, it still wasn’t perfect. In the end, he would still be killed and teleported out of the light door.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating here for seven days.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than a dozen arrows flew in the air. Lu Ming controlled the arrows condensed by his mental energy fire and continuously blocked the arrows that were shot at him.</p><p>In the end, when Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was depleted, there were no more arrows coming from all directions.</p><p>He blocked the attack perfectly and Lu Ming successfully passed the intermediate level.</p><p>now, my usage of mental energy fire has improved a lot, and I’m infinitely close to the ‘heart reaching’ realm.</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>For two people who had the same amount of mental energy fire, the higher the level of mental energy fire utilization, the more puppets they could control. In fact, the stronger the puppet they controlled, the stronger their combat strength would naturally be.</p><p>Furthermore, those who had a high level of mental energy fire could inscribe formations and inscription scrolls faster. They would be stronger in both elixir and weapon refinement.</p><p>This was the benefit of having a high level of mental energy usage.</p><p>The subtle realm was the meticulous use of one’s mental energy. One would not waste a single bit of it and would use it to its fullest potential.</p><p>The heart limit realm, as its name suggested, moved one’s mind and the fire of one’s spirit. It was incomparably fast.</p><p>At this realm, be it controlling puppets or inscribing formations, he was terrifyingly fast. In an instant, he was able to inscribe a large formation. How strong was his combat power?</p><p>It could be said that when two people with the same level of mental energy fire used their mental energy to the extreme realm, they could easily kill someone in the subtle realm.</p><p>As for the ‘intent movement’ and ‘Shenhe’, they were even more amazing.</p><p>now, the intermediate difficulty is no longer enough for me to level up. It’s time to choose the advanced difficulty!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming chose the advanced difficulty and stepped in.</p><p>He had just entered for a few breaths when there was a flash of light outside the door of light. Lu Ming reappeared.</p><p>“This is too fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>In the advanced difficulty, the arrows that appeared were insanely fast and extremely agile. They could make hundreds of turns in an instant. The mental fire arrow that Lu Ming controlled could not keep up with them at all. The moment they entered, they were killed in seconds before they could even block one arrow.</p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to train in the intermediate difficulty for a while longer!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He chose the intermediate difficulty again and started to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days passed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s usage of the mental energy fire was getting better and better. The arrows condensed by the mental energy fire became more and more agile under his control. Their speed was terrifyingly fast.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>He controlled an arrow and shot it into the middle of the other’s arrow shaft. The remaining power didn’t stop and even offset the other arrow.</p><p>If Lu Ming used one arrow, he would be able to nullify two arrows that were made of mental fire of the same strength.</p><p>When there were no more arrows condensed around him, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was only left with half of it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s usage of mental energy fire had improved by another level. However, he felt that he had not broken through the ‘heart to heart’ realm.</p><p>now, I should be able to try the advanced difficulty!</p><p>Lu Ming exited the place and chose the advanced difficulty. He took a step in.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An arrow moved as fast as lightning in the air. It changed hundreds of directions in an instant, leaving a long trace.</p><p>Lu Ming could not keep up with the speed of the other party by controlling an arrow.</p><p>He controlled the nine arrows and sniped them from different directions.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine arrows flew in different directions and blocked the incoming arrow.</p><p>With a bang, the arrow was finally stopped. However, before Lu Ming could celebrate, two more arrows formed and shot toward him.</p><p>Lu Ming could only gather more arrows to block it.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming only lasted for half a minute before he was teleported out.</p><p>Continue!</p><p>After failing, as long as his mental energy was restored, Lu Ming would continue to step in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
