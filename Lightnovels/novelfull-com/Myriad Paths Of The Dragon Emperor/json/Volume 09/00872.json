Some were in deep thought. Lu Ming had agreed so quickly. Could it be that the Dao of inscription was also extremely powerful? but how was that possible?</p><p>If the martial path was already so freakish, how strong could the Dao of inscription be?</p><p>“The true Qi in your bodies will dissipate in two hours!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the young men who were still lying on the ground. He smiled faintly and stepped into the air to leave.</p><p>“Hey, tianyun, wait for me!”</p><p>Bai chixue immediately followed him like a little shadow. This made the sunrise and other suitors who were pursuing Bai chixue gnash their teeth in jealousy. However, no one dared to cause trouble for Lu Ming.</p><p>What a joke. Lu Ming was so powerful in martial arts. Was he looking for a beating?</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai chixue swaggered out of the place.</p><p>“Your martial arts cultivation is actually so powerful? You actually hid it from me?”</p><p>On the way, Bai chixue stared at Lu Ming and mumbled.</p><p>“You didn’t ask me!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re that strong? He should be very famous, why haven’t I heard of him before?” Bai chixue was confused.</p><p>“Because I’m more low-key. I’ve always been low-key, so it’s normal that you don’t know me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said shamelessly, which immediately attracted Bai chixue’s contempt.</p><p>“You want to keep a low profile? He defeated more than ten God-level heaven’s favorites at once. I’m afraid that in two days, the news will spread all over Mount Liangyi!”</p><p>Bai chixue rolled her eyes at Lu Ming and said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. He was forced to do this.</p><p>“Are you really going to participate in the competition two months from now?”</p><p>Bai chixue asked again.</p><p>“Of course, I’ve already agreed. By the way, what kind of place is the observatory? What’s so special about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>the heaven observation platform is also known as the heaven observation land. It can be said to be the number one cultivation Holy Land of the symbol puppet sect. It is said that in the heaven observation land, one can come into close contact with the inscription laws. By observing the inscription laws, the speed of absorbing the power of inscription will be frighteningly fast. However, the energy required to open the heaven observation land is extremely terrifying. Therefore, the number of people who can enter each time is very limited!</p><p>the other 13 zongzis have already entered. This time, only three people will be allowed to enter the heaven observation zone. Therefore, a competition will be held in the entire sect. Only the top three can enter the heaven observation zone for a month!</p><p>Bai chixue explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had a rough idea in his heart.</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>Bai chixue asked, blinking her big eyes. She was curious.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!” Lu Ming’s answer made Bai chixue stumble and almost fall.</p><p>“No? If you’re not confident, why did you agree?”</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>“If you agree, you’ll have at least two months of peace, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Indeed, he wasn’t 100% confident. After all, he had only been in contact with the Dao of inscription for a short period of time. The other heaven’s favorites had already cultivated for more than ten years.</p><p>This was especially so for geniuses like Ji mai, Yan Tong, and Meng Jia. Lu Ming had no confidence in winning just by relying on the Dao of inscription.</p><p>In terms of the richness of his mental energy fire, Lu Ming was confident that it would not be inferior to Ji mai and the rest. One should know that Lu Ming had lit ten mental energy lamps at every level, achieving perfection.</p><p>No matter how talented Ji mai and the others were, it was impossible for them to reach the perfect stage. It was already terrifying to be able to light eight lamps of will at each level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s weakness was his usage of mental energy fire.</p><p>His usage of mental energy fire had already reached the peak of the refinement realm. In the eyes of Ordinary Geniuses, it was already very terrifying and not weaker than many God-tier geniuses.</p><p>However, Lu Ming believed that geniuses like Ji mai were definitely not just at the peak of minute subtlety. Perhaps, they had already reached the realm of ‘heart’.</p><p>The higher one’s mental energy level was, the stronger one’s combat strength would be when they had the same mental energy fire.</p><p>His current weakness was the use of mental fire.</p><p>Bai chixue was speechless. So Lu Ming had agreed to it just for two months of peace.</p><p>Soon, the two of them returned to Yun Peak House.</p><p>yes, I have to go and buy another batch of demonic beast blood essence to continue to improve the grade of my bloodline!</p><p>Back in his room, Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>“Also, the third bloodline, I don’t know why? I still can’t awaken!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming frowned a little.</p><p>Many God-level prodigies had already awakened their third bloodline before they reached the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier. However, he had yet to awaken it.</p><p>He could clearly feel that his spine seemed to be nurturing something, but he could not awaken it. He always felt that something was missing.</p><p>little Qing and fatty are also awakening slower than others. I don’t know if it’s good or bad!</p><p>also, I can’t just let things be in the competition two months from now. I have to convince those people so that they won’t find trouble with me. It’ll be beneficial for me to take charge of the talisman Amulet sect in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with various thoughts.</p><p>However, it wasn’t that easy to make these God-tier heaven’s favorites submit.</p><p>if I can improve the realm of the use of mental fire, I’ll be more confident. I wonder if there’s a place in the yin and yang mountain where I can refine and use the mental fire!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming took out the map that Bai chixue gave him and opened it to read.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up after a while.</p><p>The mental energy refining Hall was a cultivation ground that specialized in training the use of mental energy fire. The talisman sect was indeed an Overlord force that specialized in the Dao of inscription. It had everything.</p><p>Lu Ming was now a zongzi candidate. Apart from a few restricted places, he could enter most of the cultivation places. It was a good time to cultivate there.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out the rough stone and began to devour it to recover his essential core.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s essential core had fully recovered. He left Cloud Peak Residence and headed to the spirit training hall.</p><p>The spirit tempering Hall was a large hall, but it was filled with formations and could accommodate many people to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming flashed his zongzi candidate token and entered easily.</p><p>After entering the hall, he found that there were many doors of light. At a glance, there were at least a few hundred.</p><p>Lu Ming walked inside and chose a door of light in an isolated corner.</p><p>On the door of light, there were words of elementary, intermediate, advanced, and top-notch.</p><p>this should be the choice of difficulty. I’ll choose intermediate!</p><p>Lu Ming pressed the word ‘intermediate’ and the word ‘intermediate’ shone brightly.</p><p>Then, he took a step and stepped in. When he entered the light door, he found himself in an empty void.</p><p>Here, Lu Ming realized that the essential core in his body was suppressed. Even his intent realm was suppressed. He could only use his mental energy fire.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blue arrow shot toward Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>an arrow condensed from mental fire!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could clearly sense that this arrow was completely condensed from mental energy fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
