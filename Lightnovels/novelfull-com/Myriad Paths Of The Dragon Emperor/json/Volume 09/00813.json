This turned the divine Dragon’s three absolutes into a demigod-level martial arts technique that Lu Ming had cultivated to the highest level.</p><p>...</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming undoubtedly had many more means to deal with his enemies.</p><p>His heaven and earth essence realm was also progressing at an amazing speed. The wind, fire, and Thunder essence realms had all reached the upper tier of level two. Only the earth essence realm had been stuck at the peak of level two lower tier for a few months.</p><p>It was very difficult to cultivate the intent of earth, and there were many bottlenecks. It was much slower to improve than the nine common intents.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming had to multitask. If he only cultivated one kind of earth concept, his speed would definitely be much faster.</p><p>With the improvement of his intent, his cultivation naturally increased rapidly as well. Currently, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the fifth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Compared to five months ago, he had improved by three levels.</p><p>Their overall combat strength was much stronger than it was five months ago.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree and the massive resources left behind by the nine suns Supreme Master were inseparable from his great progress.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked in the direction of the nine suns cosmos. The nine suns cosmos was still sitting cross-legged under the soul consolidation tree. It had been five months and he had not moved.</p><p>However, the remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme Master was much more solid than it was five months ago, giving off a heavy feeling.</p><p>The soul-consolidating fruits on the two soul-consolidating fruit trees had long since disappeared. Not only that, but the two soul-consolidating fruit trees had also completely withered and turned into dried branches.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that it would not be long before the nine suns Supreme would wake up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he left the cave abode.</p><p>It was time to collect the blood essence once every seven days.</p><p>Not long after, he saw a figure standing in the air, facing the wind.</p><p>It was Wang haoxian.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, Wang haoxian waved his hand and threw seven Jade bottles to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took the bottles and threw the seven empty bottles to Wang haoxian.</p><p>“What do you want so much demonic beast blood essence for? You’re refining pills?”</p><p>Wang haoxian asked curiously.</p><p>After five months, Wang haoxian’s state of mind had gradually calmed down. It seemed that he had gotten used to coming here every seven days to hand over seven portions of blood essence and meet Lu Ming.</p><p>For the past five months, Lu Ming had only asked her to hunt demonic beasts and obtain their blood essence. He had not asked her to do anything else.</p><p>“How about a battle with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>After five months of hard work, Lu Ming wanted to test the results of his cultivation.</p><p>Wang haoxian was undoubtedly the most suitable candidate.</p><p>“You want to fight me? When I attack, I won’t show any mercy. When I beat you up until you lose an arm or a leg, don’t use the soul splitting array to threaten me!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes flashed.</p><p>don’t worry. As long as you have the ability, I won’t use the soul splitting array to threaten you even if you cripple me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, you asked for this!”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes turned cold. His body was covered in blazing flames. He took a big step forward and punched.</p><p>The scorching fist ray blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He waved it casually and the fist radiance was destroyed.</p><p>“No need to probe, use your full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Wang haoxian frowned slightly. Her punch just now had 80% of her strength five months ago. If it were five months ago, Lu Ming would definitely have been sent flying. But now, Lu Ming had easily destroyed her fist radiance.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming had made great progress in the past five months.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, Wang haoxian’s aura exploded.</p><p>In an instant, it reached the aura of the peak fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm. However, this wasn’t the limit and continued to rise.</p><p>Early sixth level spiritual ocean tier, middle sixth level spiritual ocean tier …</p><p>It rose all the way to the peak sixth level spiritual ocean realm before stopping.</p><p>Obviously, Wang haoxian’s cultivation had improved greatly during this period of time.</p><p>This was for sure. It was impossible that Lu Ming was not the only one who was improving. The others were also improving at all times.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wang haoxian stepped forward and threw a punch at Lu Ming. The power of this punch was even more terrifying.</p><p>“This is more like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. His aura burst forth, and his long spear thrust forward like a dragon. A true dragon of four colors flew out and pounced forward.</p><p>With a loud boom, Wang haoxian’s fist force was destroyed. Although the four-colored true dragon had shrunk a little, it still pounced forward.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s expression changed. He waved his fists again and two fist auras shot out.</p><p>One of the fist radiance and the four-colored true dragon dispersed at the same time, while the other one was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear radiance exploded and shattered Wang haoxian’s fist radiance. He strode forward and his spear radiance was like a mountain as it smashed towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang haoxian let out a long roar and the flames were boiling as he fought Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>But the more the battle went on, the more shocked Wang haoxian was.</p><p>He was actually suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the peak fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, one level lower than her, but he was still able to suppress her. What was shocking was that Lu Ming did not seem to be using a bloodline martial arts technique.</p><p>This was even more shocking.</p><p>In fact, this was normal. In the past five months, Lu Ming’s four intents had all broken through and improved. Wang haoxian’s intents had reached the completion of level two five months ago. Although they had improved this month, they were still at the completion of level two.</p><p>Therefore, in terms of artistic conception, Lu Ming’s improvement was much greater than hers. That was why Lu Ming could skip a level and easily suppress her.</p><p>“No, I can’t be defeated by him!”</p><p>Wang haoxian roared in her heart. A purple flame appeared above her head. Her body was fused with the purple flame. The purple flame twisted and turned into a purple Firebird, which pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bloodline fusion!</p><p>“I was just waiting for this move!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and his infinite Dragon Spear disappeared. He struck at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the palm passed through, the space trembled. The Firebird wailed and flew back, turning back into Wang haoxian. His face was pale and blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. Lu Ming did not even use Blood Meridian fusion. He had destroyed her Blood Meridian fusion with one move and returned her to her original form.</p><p>How could he be so terrifying? She felt that the power of Lu Ming’s palm seemed to be able to suppress heaven and earth, giving her a feeling that she could not resist it.</p><p>What followed was frustration and dejection.</p><p>Five months. It had only been five months.</p><p>Five months ago, Lu Ming was no match for her at all. He was chased around by her and was almost killed by her. Five months later, even though her cultivation level had increased by one level, she was still easily defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>This was a little hard for her to accept.</p><p>In the future, was there any hope of seeking revenge on Lu Ming? The hope was getting slimmer and slimmer.</p><p>Wang haoxian felt a sense of helplessness.</p><p>She had only felt this kind of powerlessness when she was facing those freaks on the top of the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming could compete with those perverts?</p><p>the prison suppressing heaven art is equivalent to a high-grade demigod martial technique. It’s indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a satisfied smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
