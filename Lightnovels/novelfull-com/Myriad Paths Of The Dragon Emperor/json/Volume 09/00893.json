All of its blood essence, blood, demonic power, and life essence were devoured and deprived by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the surging energy in the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, all kinds of energy.</p><p>“How could this be? It actually devoured all the energy of a giant lizard. This is too overbearing. Could it be because he has awakened the complete bloodline of the nine Dragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>This was the first time he had devoured a demonic beast’s corpse ever since his nine-Dragon bloodline had advanced to the divine level and transformed into the nine-clawed form. Before this, he had only bought the blood essence to devour and had not tried it yet.</p><p>Previously, he had only felt that the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline had been greatly enhanced, but he had not expected it to be so overbearing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems like you’ve brought out the full potential of that kid, Jiulong!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“The talent of the nine Dragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>yes, the most powerful talent of the nine Dragons is to devour everything. All energy will be devoured and turned into their own use. It’s extremely terrifying!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“Devour everything and turn it into your own!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to refine.</p><p>Lu Ming began to refine the various energies within the nine Dragon bloodlines. The blood essence was still converted into the power of the bloodline and absorbed by the nine Dragon bloodlines. Other energies such as blood, life essence, demonic energy, and so on were all refined into essential core and surged into Lu Ming’s spirit ocean. Instantly, Lu Ming’s essential core was enhanced.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>&Nbsp; it was really too overbearing. All the other energy had been turned into true Yuan and blood essence to increase his bloodline power. Not a single bit was wasted.</p><p>In that case, he would not even need to use raw gemstones for his cultivation in the future.</p><p>haha, I didn’t expect that the bloodline of the nine Dragons would have such a heaven-defying ability after being fully awakened. I’ll try hunting demonic beasts again!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. His figure flashed as he began to search for demonic beasts to kill.</p><p>He killed several demonic beasts in a row, but it was all the same. Whether it was the blood essence, demonic power, life essence, etc., They were all devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons and turned into his own energy. It was extremely domineering.</p><p>amazing! If I wasn’t trapped by the essence realm of heaven and earth, my cultivation would have improved by leaps and bounds!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and continued to move forward, looking for powerful demonic beasts to kill.</p><p>Not long after, they had gone another few hundred thousand li.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>With a loud roar, the space trembled and a huge staff whipped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>No, it was not a giant stick, but the trunk of a giant elephant.</p><p>The elephant was as large as a mountain and covered in fur. With a flick of its nose, the space trembled, causing Lu Ming to feel immense pressure.</p><p>A level Seven demonic beast!</p><p>This was a level Seven demonic beast that was equivalent to the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard and Lu Ming instantly burst out with dragon energy. Densely packed scales appeared on Lu Ming’s skin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He punched out and activated the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>The fist and the nose of the Colossus collided, resulting in an earth-shattering boom. Lu Ming felt an extremely powerful force surging towards him, and his body was sent flying backward uncontrollably.</p><p>However, the elephant’s trunk was also sent flying by him. The elephant roared, shaking the sky.</p><p>the first tier of the seventh level is equivalent to the first tier of the spirit embryo realm. I can put up a fight!</p><p>Lu Ming stopped in the air, his eyes glistening.</p><p>This giant elephant had immense strength but it was not ridiculously strong. Lu Ming could fight it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, his figure like a stream of light, and rushed toward the giant elephant.</p><p>The elephant howled and swung its trunk at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shifted, changing his position in the air and successfully avoiding the elephant’s attack. He appeared above the elephant’s head and stomped on its head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength in this kick. The prison-suppressing heavenly art was activated to its maximum power, which was equivalent to a high-grade demigod martial technique. With this kick, it landed on the head of the giant elephant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, the elephant’s head caved in, followed by the sound of bones breaking.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant elephant wailed and whipped its trunk at Lu Ming frantically. Lu Ming’s figure moved and he flew into the sky.</p><p>“What a strong defense!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath, his eyes were solemn.</p><p>The defense of this giant elephant was terrifyingly strong. Under his full-force attack, even a ten-thousand-meter-tall mountain would be instantly shattered. It could sink the earth within a hundred miles. However, when it hit the giant elephant’s head, it didn’t kill it instantly.</p><p>The elephant roared, its eyes filled with madness and bloodlust as it charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>As his feet stepped on the ground, the ground cracked and countless ancient trees were destroyed. It was a scene of doomsday.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>With a swing of its trunk, a Gale swept out, and a huge ravine appeared on the ground. It was as if a Valley had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dodged the elephant’s trunk. He then rushed toward the elephant’s head.</p><p>This giant elephant was extremely strong and had amazing defensive power, but its weakness was that it was relatively slow.</p><p>However, the speed was only slow compared to Lu Ming. If it were other people in the spiritual ocean tier, they would have been crushed to pieces by the giant elephant’s trunk.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared on the elephant’s head and took another step.</p><p>The moment he took a step forward, a Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming once again burst out with dragon energy.</p><p>The two dragon energies in his body exploded at the same time. Lu Ming’s attack power had reached a shocking level.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, the elephant’s head exploded, leaving a huge hole. The elephant wailed and fell to the ground. Soon, it stopped breathing.</p><p>The giant elephant that was equivalent to the first level of the spirit embryo realm was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He could feel that he only had half of his essential core left in his body. He smiled bitterly.</p><p>The true essence consumption of the prison suppressing heavenly art was truly terrifying. In just two strikes, half of his true essence had been used up.</p><p>my current pure martial arts combat power is no weaker than a first level spirit embryo realm martial artist. Of course, that’s only in comparison to ordinary martial artists!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The reason why he could kill the elephant in two moves was mainly because the speed of the elephant was relatively slow, which was why he could hit its vital point two times in a row. If it were any other fast elephant, it would not have been so easy to kill it.</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear about this.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. The devouring power burst out and enveloped the giant elephant.</p><p>The mountain-like body of the giant elephant rapidly shriveled.</p><p>what shocking energy. Let’s find a place to refine it!</p><p>After devouring the energy of the giant elephant, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he found a cave. He set up an array and began to refine it.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Waves of energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body continuously. The essential core that he had expended was quickly restored, but the energy continued to flow into his body.</p><p>it’s too robust. I’m stuck in the intent realm and can’t break through. What should I do? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the spirit sea howling. The majestic energy surged in and the spirit sea was about to overflow.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
