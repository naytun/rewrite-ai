Only those with low cultivation would make such useless remarks. Kill!</p><p>...</p><p>Wang haoxian was very decisive. As soon as she finished speaking, she pounced on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>retreat! Lu Ming shouted. Together with Xie nianqing, the three of them retreated quickly.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Wang haoxian descended and strode forward.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer. He took a step forward and inscriptions appeared on the ground. Many formations emerged.</p><p>Sword Qi, blade energy, and vines were all flying towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>“You set up a great inscription formation here!”</p><p>Wang haoxian roared and used bloodline fusion. He turned into a purple flame and rampaged in the array.</p><p>let’s go. This Wang haoxian is too strong. His bloodline is a natural bloodline. After using bloodline fusion, he will be extremely difficult to kill. Even my inscription array will not be able to kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Together with Xie nianqing, the three of them took to the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Dao of inscription had just broken through to level six. He had only spent half a day to inscribe the inscription formation. It was not enough to kill Wang haoxian.</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that Wang haoxian was able to survive the attack of the Thunder cauldron because of his strong vitality. This was the advantage of a natural-type bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming had just lost fifty years of his life. It would be difficult for him to control the lightning cauldron and launch a second attack.</p><p>If he forced it to burst out, he would lose a lot of life essence in a short period of time. It would definitely affect his future martial arts cultivation and even affect his Foundation, making it difficult for him to improve further.</p><p>The only thing they could do now was to trap Wang haoxian and then retreat.</p><p>The three of them flew in the direction of ninedragons. Very quickly, they had covered a distance of 100000 miles.</p><p>“Little Qing, fatty, you two go to the tianqiong relic first!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were slightly stunned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? You want to deal with Wang haoxian alone? no way!”</p><p>Xie nianqing saw through Lu Ming’s thoughts at one glance and rejected him flatly.</p><p>that’s right. That crazy woman is too strong. If you stay here alone, you’ll only be courting death. If we want to fight, the three of us will fight together!</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>don’t worry, I won’t fight him head-on. I’m her target, so I’ll draw them away. You guys go to the sky relic. We’ll meet at the sea Cloud sect in half a year!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I won’t agree!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head firmly.</p><p>listen to me. My inscription formation can’t trap Wang haoxian for long. She will catch up with us soon. If this continues, we will die in her hands. Don’t worry, I am 100% sure that I can shake off Wang haoxian by myself!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie nianqing still shook his head.</p><p>“Fatty!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Kong Jin.</p><p>“Are you really 100% confident?” Kong Jin asked.</p><p>“100%, but with the three of us together, we don’t even have 10%. Little Qing, be obedient!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I want to follow you. Don’t try to lie to me!” Xie nianqing said stubbornly.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He sighed and said, alright then. Fatty, you go first. Xiao Qing and I will distract Wang haoxian!</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and held Xie nianqing’s hand.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly made his move. He stretched out his hand and touched Xie nianqing’s body a few times. Xie nianqing never expected Lu Ming to suddenly attack her. She was caught off guard. At this moment, her body fell limply to the ground and she fell unconscious.</p><p>Lu Ming supported Xie nianqing and said to Kong Jin, ” “Fatty, take little Qing to the tianqiong relic!”</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Kong Jin was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Hurry up. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. It’s just that this girl’s temper is too stubborn, so I can only do this. She’ll wake up soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he looked at the fatty.</p><p>“Alright, then take care!”</p><p>Kong Jin sighed. This was the only way.</p><p>He also knew that it would be difficult for the three of them to escape Wang haoxian’s pursuit. Lu Ming might have a way.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you don’t come, I’ll see you at the sea Cloud sect in half a year!”</p><p>Fatty’s vital essence rolled up Xie nianqing and he quickly flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming landed and sat cross-legged on a mountain peak. He continued to devour spirit crystals to recover his vital essence.</p><p>The nine-Dragon bloodline devoured the spiritual crystals like crazy, and his vital essence was recovering quickly.</p><p>60%, 70%, 80%.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s essential core had recovered by 80%.</p><p>At this moment, a purple light flashed in the distance. Wang haoxian’s figure appeared.</p><p>At this moment, her breathing was somewhat chaotic, and her face was somewhat pale. Clearly, she had paid a price for breaking out of those great formations.</p><p>“It’s just you alone. You want to stall me and let the other two escape? that’s a good plan. However, I’ll kill you soon and then go kill the other two!”</p><p>Wang haoxian sneered.</p><p>“Oh, if you have the ability, come and kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Wang haoxian snorted coldly. However, she did not land as she was afraid that Lu Ming would inscribe runes and arrays below.</p><p>“I won’t go down, I’ll Still Kill you!”</p><p>Wang haoxian sneered. He waved his fists and a fiery fist radiance burst out, aiming at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and chose a different direction from Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to leave!”</p><p>Wang haoxian turned into a flame and continued to pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s movement technique was not to be underestimated. He was extremely fast.</p><p>On the other hand, although Lu Ming was using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, he could only take four steps in a row. His level was still a little low. Even though he was extremely fast, he was only on par with Wang haoxian.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and one escaping, were far away in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Before long, the two of them had flown for millions of miles. Wang haoxian was still following closely behind Lu Ming, not giving up.</p><p>I say, pretty lady, do you really want to court me so badly? I already have someone I like.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wang haoxian shouted angrily.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming did not forget to attack her with all kinds of words as he fled. She was so angry that she almost exploded. Her killing intent toward Lu Ming grew stronger.</p><p>“This woman is too damn difficult to deal with!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and continued flying.</p><p>In front of him, a boundless mountain forest appeared.</p><p>The trees in this mountain forest were exceptionally tall. Strangely, the trees were all black, even the leaves were black. It was extremely strange.</p><p>As they neared the forest, they could hear the thunderous roars of demonic beasts that were filled with ferocity.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in without any hesitation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically the moment he rushed in.</p><p>He felt as if his body had become ten times heavier. There was a kind of pressure from heaven and earth that pressed down on his body, causing his speed to be greatly reduced.</p><p>It was at least ten times slower.</p><p>But now, he could only try his best to move forward.</p><p>Fortunately, Wang haoxian’s speed was also greatly reduced when he rushed into the forest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
