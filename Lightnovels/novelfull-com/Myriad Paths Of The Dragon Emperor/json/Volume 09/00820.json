The wind sword sect’s upper echelons have been completely annihilated. It will soon be swallowed up by other forces. From then on, the wind sword sect will no longer exist!</p><p>Fatty walked up and patted ruan Tingting’s shoulder.</p><p>He was afraid that ruan Tingting would sink into hatred and murder, unable to extricate herself.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, ruan Tingting shook her sword and the blood on the blade evaporated. She put away the sword and smiled, ” “Fatty, thank you!”</p><p>He then walked toward Lu Ming and the rest,”Lu Ming, miss Xie, thank you!”</p><p>The reason why she could reach this stage and take revenge was all because of Lu Ming and a few others.</p><p>Back then, when she had obtained the legacy and was hunted down by the Luan family and the Jiang family, Lu Ming and the rest had protected her with their lives. Otherwise, she would not be where she was today.</p><p>“Since we’re friends, there’s no need to thank me. Let’s go and see the heavenly corpse sect’s elites!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Under the shocked gazes of many wind sword sect disciples, they left the wind sword sect and flew in the direction of the Dragon vein.</p><p>According to ruan Tingting, at the entrance of a cultivation sacred ground in the Dragon vein, there were geniuses from the heavenly corpse sect who set up a battle platform to challenge the geniuses of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. It had been a few days, and the Emperor heaven divine Palace was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>That was why long Qianli had brought his men here, hoping to stabilize the situation.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence, the Overlord factions would send their elites. First, it could be used as a form of training and to test the other side’s strength. Second, it could also strike a blow to the other side’s morale.</p><p>Together with ruan Tingting, Lu Ming and the rest flew toward the Dragon vein.</p><p>The Wushang Valley was a relatively famous cultivation Holy Land on the Dragon vein occupied by the Wang family. It was of a higher level than the hundred venerated mountains, and there were more geniuses cultivating here.</p><p>For example, many quasi-God heaven’s favorites ranked 300 to 400 would choose to cultivate here.</p><p>The paragons of the heavenly corpse sect pulled up a stone platform from the ground at the entrance of the Wushang Valley and used it as a battle platform.</p><p>The eight paragons of the heavenly corpse sect stood on one side of the fighting ring. They were all wearing black robes and had cold smiles on their faces.</p><p>Another Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect stood in the middle of the platform, looking around.</p><p>There were many figures surrounding the fighting ring.</p><p>They were all geniuses and geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Long Qianli stood at the front.</p><p>“The Empyrean heaven divine Palace only has so few geniuses? Those at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, who else wants to come up for a fight?”</p><p>In the middle of the fighting ring, the paragons of the heavenly corpse sect looked around with a smug expression.</p><p>For a moment, no one dared to go up.</p><p>Just now, that Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect had already defeated three paragons at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier in a row. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>damn it. The heavenly corpse sect must have selected the top figures of all levels through a series of selections. Our Empyrean divine Palace naturally has such figures. It’s just that they’re not here for a while!</p><p>“That’s right, we were just caught off guard by them!”</p><p>The people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were discussing animatedly. They were extremely indignant.</p><p>The geniuses from the heavenly corpse sect were naturally the best of their respective levels. They were invincible among their peers. They had no way of finding so many experts in such a short time.</p><p>Blood Sword 19, if you have the ability, let’s fight!</p><p>Long Qianli took a step forward and stared at the man in the middle of the eight heavenly corpse sect elites.</p><p>Blood Sword 19 was a God-grade genius of the heavenly corpse sect, ranked 294th, while long Qianli was ranked 295th. The two of them were equal in rank.</p><p>“Why are you so anxious? Wait a moment, let the others compete first. After that, I will naturally fight you.”</p><p>Blood Sword 19 looked at long Qianli and sneered.</p><p>Long Qianli’s expression was ugly.</p><p>In the past few days, the heavenly corpse sect had continuously sent out geniuses at the second and third level of the spiritual ocean realm. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace had been completely defeated, and they could not afford to lose again.</p><p>“Fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, who is going to fight me?”</p><p>On the stone platform, the disciples of the heavenly corpse sect continued to issue challenges.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A voice came from the distance, and a ray of light flew over at extreme speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a figure landed on the stone platform.</p><p>“It’s Gai Chang, it’s Gai Chang!”</p><p>Gai Chang, 359th on the list of top 1000 talents, is a potential heaven’s favorite. Good, we have hope now!</p><p>Everyone was excited.</p><p>Finally, a quasi-heaven’s favorite at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier arrived.</p><p>The list of top 1000 talents hadn’t been updated for a long time, and many geniuses had emerged. It was no longer authoritative to use the previous list to determine the combat strength of the current geniuses.</p><p>Some people rose up, some progressed slowly, and some even rose to the sky and awakened divine bloodlines.</p><p>Therefore, the strength of the top 1000 talents on the list was in a mess.</p><p>However, he could probably use it as a reference.</p><p>Those who were ranked at the top previously would not be too bad.</p><p>“Gai Chang, I hope you won’t disappoint me!”</p><p>The expert from the sky corpse sect said.</p><p>“I also hope so!”</p><p>Gai Chang said coldly.</p><p>Then, the two of them started fighting.</p><p>However, after a dozen or so moves, everyone was shocked to find that Gai Chang was completely suppressed and at a disadvantage. After another dozen or so moves, Gai Chang was sent flying and coughed up large amounts of blood.</p><p>He was defeated, and defeated again.</p><p>haha, you really can’t take a single blow. Let me tell you, in the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, I’m not the strongest. There are still many stronger than me in the heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>The Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect sneered.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s there to be proud of? Our heaven’s favorite is just not here now!”</p><p>“At the exchange in half a month’s time, let’s see how arrogant you can be then.”</p><p>Some people were indignant.</p><p>Those from the heavenly corpse sect coldly laughed. They naturally knew that there were more geniuses in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. There were many of them who were in closed-door cultivation. But so what? Their goal was to crush the morale of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, a few more beams of light flew over in the sky, and six young figures appeared.</p><p>As soon as these figures appeared, they immediately attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>This was because there were four young women in this group of six. Each of them was extremely beautiful, especially Xie nianqing, who firmly attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>The six people were Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout was heard, and several figures flew out with undisguised killing intent.</p><p>“Chaotic wind cloud!”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The one who had spoken was none other than Luan Fengyun. Lu Ming would never forget how Luan Fengyun had injured Xie nianqing in a sneak attack at the battle of the hundred venerates mountain half a year ago.</p><p>He did not expect to run into chaotic wind and cloud here again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys have been hiding for half a year. Let’s see where you can hide today!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun glared at Lu Ming and the rest with killing intent.</p><p>His gaze lingered on ruan Tingting for a moment before he looked at long Qianli. The only person he was afraid of was long Qianli, and he was afraid that long Qianli would interfere.</p><p>“He hid for half a year?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we meet again!”</p><p>Suddenly, another person was born in the crowd. A figure stepped on the air and ascended.</p><p>“Wang Jue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
