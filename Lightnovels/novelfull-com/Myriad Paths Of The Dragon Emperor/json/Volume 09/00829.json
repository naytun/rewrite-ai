If all of you go up, we’ll naturally be at a disadvantage. How about this? for each level, each of the three sides will send out ten people and take turns to compete. When one side is completely eliminated, the side with the most people remaining will win. What do you think?”</p><p>The demonic corpse opened his mouth. His voice was extremely hoarse, like the sound of metal rubbing against each other.</p><p>“Good, this is exactly what I want!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man of the demon clan spoke. Clearly, he was the leader of the geniuses of the demon clan.</p><p>alright, I have no objections either. However, let’s forget about the lower three levels of the spiritual ocean tier. How about we start directly from the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier? ”</p><p>Di Feng said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The demonic corpse and the Golden-robed young man of the demon clan both nodded in agreement.</p><p>“In that case, let’s choose our own candidates!”</p><p>With that, di Feng flew down from the stands and began to discuss the candidates with a few other human geniuses.</p><p>This battle could be considered the most intense clash before the battle of Providence. It could test the other side and also take the opportunity to suppress the other side’s momentum. None of the three sides dared to be careless, and they would send their strongest candidates.</p><p>After a while, a young man flew toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After he arrived, he cupped his fist at Kong Jin and said, ” “Brother Kong Jin?”</p><p>“It’s me!” Fatty was slightly taken aback.</p><p>brother Kong Jin’s cultivation should be at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, right? young master di Feng, I would like to invite brother Kong to participate in the fifth level spiritual ocean realm competition. What do you think? ”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Me? Haha, I’m honored by young master di Feng’s high regard for me. I agree!”</p><p>The fatty laughed heartily, feeling a little smug. So many people had chosen him to fight, so he was naturally proud.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were moved. It was probably because fatty had displayed his powerful combat strength in the battle with the people from the heavenly corpse sect some time ago. That was why he was invited to fight.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The young man laughed, then turned around and left.</p><p>“Eh? Why didn’t you invite Lu Ming?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was a little surprised.</p><p>Logically speaking, Lu Ming had displayed even more powerful combat strength in the battle with GUI Yue of the heavenly corpse sect half a month ago. Why was Lu Ming not invited to the battle at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier?</p><p>Xie nianqing, fatty, Qiao Xuan, and the others were also surprised.</p><p>most of the God-tier geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents are at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm. I guess that because there are too many God-tier geniuses at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and they don’t know Lu Ming’s bloodline level, they didn’t choose him!</p><p>Wang haoxian said.</p><p>Many of the God-level geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents were at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm, such as Wang haoxian and long Qianli. With enough people, it was normal that they didn’t choose Lu Ming.</p><p>For example, Wang haoxian and long Qianli, who had only awakened first class divine bloodlines, were not selected.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Since he did not need to fight, he could relax and watch the battles between the other geniuses. It was good to broaden his horizons.</p><p>Not long after, the candidates for the three parties were selected.</p><p>“This time, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace will be the host. Let us begin!”</p><p>Di Feng laughed as he announced a name.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young figure flew up to the center of the fighting ring. His body was like a blade, and an extremely sharp aura filled the air.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was at the peak fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Looking at his cultivation technique, he was the Jiang family’s chosen one.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>The Jiang family’s sovereign looked in the direction of the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley and shouted.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>From the direction of the heavenly corpse sect, a figure flickered out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>The aura he revealed was also at the peak fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Without saying anything, the young man from the Jiang family stepped forward. The sharp aura around him became even more intense. His entire person was like a battle blade.</p><p>His arm was like a saber, slashing toward the young man from the sky corpse sect.</p><p>The young man from the heavenly corpse sect quickly retreated, distancing himself from the Jiang family’s sovereign. With a wave of his hand, nine refined corpses appeared in front of him.</p><p>The nine refined corpses exuded an ancient aura. They were wearing metal armor and holding bronze Spears.</p><p>The aura that the nine refined corpses emitted had actually all reached the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The young man from the heavenly corpse sect was only at the peak fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, yet he was able to control nine refined corpses at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He was absolutely terrifying and had an unparalleled talent in refining corpses.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Jiang family’s chosen had a serious expression on his face as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>He clashed with a refined corpse and sent it flying.</p><p>The refined corpse’s skin was as tough as iron, and it was invulnerable. The Jiang family’s Paragon had only sent the refined corpse flying, but he hadn’t cracked it.</p><p>After the first refined corpse was sent flying, the other eight refined corpses pounced toward the Jiang family’s chosen. Eight long Spears pierced through the air, creating a terrifying Sonic Boom as they flew toward the Jiang family’s chosen.</p><p>The Jiang family’s Paragon let out a long howl as his body glowed with a black light. He was like an incomparably sharp divine weapon as he slaughtered his way through.</p><p>The two of them were definitely extremely powerful geniuses. Although they weren’t God-level geniuses, their battle prowess was definitely terrifying among those of the same level.</p><p>The two of them engaged in a great battle, and dozens of rounds passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Jiang family’s elites charged forward, trying to break through the refined corpse’s defense and attack the heavenly corpse sect’s disciples.</p><p>The best way to break a refined corpse was to defeat the person controlling it.</p><p>However, it would be extremely difficult for the Jiang family’s elites to break out of the nine refined corpses, which were two levels higher than him and were not afraid of death.</p><p>The situation turned into a stalemate.</p><p>After more than a hundred rounds of fighting, the Jiang family’s chosen one ran out of true Yuan and was thrown off the fighting stage, ending in defeat.</p><p>The Emperor heaven divine Palace had already lost the first battle in the exchange. This caused the expressions of many people to turn unsightly.</p><p>After the young man from the heavenly corpse sect won, he also flew down the fighting ring and sat down cross-legged to recover.</p><p>He could have chosen to continue fighting, but it was clear that he had used up a lot of his energy. He could only fight again after he had recovered.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect had won this round, so they should send one more person to fight.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another young man from the heavenly corpse sect stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>This time, it was the sky demon Valley’s turn to fight.</p><p>This time, the sky demon Valley sent a tall young man. He was a demon Tiger with the bloodline of the divine beast sky Tiger. However, the concentration of the bloodline was not even 10%.</p><p>Among the demonic beast descendants, it was very rare for a bloodline to reach ten percent purity, just like how it was rare for humans to awaken a divine bloodline.</p><p>However, even if it did not reach ten percent purity, it was close. This demonic Tiger was very powerful and defeated the disciple of the heavenly corpse sect after a few dozen moves.</p><p>In this way, the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley each won one battle.</p><p>“I’ll continue to battle. This time, it’s the turn of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, right?”</p><p>The eyes of the demonic Tiger turned to the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>In the Emperor heaven divine Palace, a young man flew up.</p><p>This time, the chosen one was the Dongfang family, which ranked first among the six great ancient families.</p><p>He was the pride of the Dongfang family. It was said that the Dongfang family had inherited two extremely powerful God-tier cultivation techniques.</p><p>This elite cultivated the nine gods heaven-shattering scroll, which could borrow the power of a God. It was as if a God had possessed him, and his combat strength was extremely terrifying. This time, the elite of the Dongfang clan had defeated the demonic Tiger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
