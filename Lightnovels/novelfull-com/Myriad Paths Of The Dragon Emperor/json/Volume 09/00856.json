Let’s talk about serious business first!”</p><p>...</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“Serious business? Yan kuangtu, don’t tell me you two really want to join my Talisman Amulet sect? Speaking of which, I think the sky demon Valley and the heavenly corpse sect are better choices. With the power of the heavenly corpse sect or the sky demon Valley, we can better fight against the Emperor sky divine Palace and Di Yi, right?”</p><p>Bai Shijin said as he stroked his beard.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, you’re wrong. I’m not here to seek refuge with the talisman Amulet sect. I’m here to help Lu Ming take charge of the talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was very direct and went straight to the point.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s body suddenly exploded with a powerful aura. His eyes turned cold as he stared at Yan kuangtu.”Yan kuangtu, this joke is not funny at all!”</p><p>“It’s not funny, but it’s not a joke. I’ll tell you directly. Lu Ming is the inheritor of senior Lian Cang!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>This time, Bai Shijin almost screamed. He could not control his emotions at all. His eyes were wide open and he looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“The inheritor of Grandmaster Liao Cang? You’ve seen Grandmaster Liao Cang? Grandmaster has been missing for three thousand years. Where did you see him? Don’t try to lie to me!”</p><p>A bunch of questions popped up in Bai Shijin’s mouth.</p><p>“Senior white, whether it’s true or not, you’ll know after looking at this!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and with a wave of his hand, the all-array diagram appeared in his hand. He opened the all-array diagram and a powerful aura filled the air. There were mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas carved on it. There were countless wonderful patterns and it was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Bai Shijin’s pupils contracted sharply. His eyes were fixed on the myriad array diagram in Lu Ming’s hands as he muttered to himself,”It’s the all formation illustration, it’s really the all formation illustration. What’s wrong with Grandmaster Lian Cang? Why have you disappeared for 3000 years and still haven’t returned?”</p><p>“Master Lian Cang, I’m afraid you don’t have much time left,” Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>Bai Shijin stared at Lu Ming as if he wanted to see through him.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, you still don’t believe me when I have the million formation illustration in my hands?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said coldly.</p><p>“The all formation illustration is Grandmaster Lian Cang’s divine weapon. It is also the token of the talisman sect’s leader. If not for Grandmaster Lian Cang’s direct teachings, you would never be able to get it, not even the Emperor. Where is Grandmaster Lian Cang now? I want to know!”</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming briefly told him what happened when he met Lian Cang.</p><p>“What? The patriarch was secretly killed by Di Yi? Damn it, despicable and shameless Di Yi!”</p><p>After listening to Lu Ming’s explanation, Bai Shijin roared in anger.</p><p>He really did not expect that Lian Cang would be harmed by Di Yi. Then, the Emperor heaven divine Palace slowly encroached on the talisman Amulet sect’s territory, causing the talisman Amulet sect to become weaker and weaker.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, you already know the whole story. Lu Ming is the inheritor of senior Lian Cang. He was entrusted by senior Lian Cang to take charge of the talisman Amulet sect. Are you going to disobey the patriarch’s order?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu stared at Bai Shijin and said in a deep voice.</p><p>Bai Shijin’s face darkened, as if he was considering something. After a while, he said, ” “Back then, I was greatly indebted to the Grandmaster. Without him, I would not be where I am today. I can never hope for the Grandmaster’s kindness and will never go against his orders. However, I can’t make the decision in the talisman Amulet sect. There are still elders in the talisman sect. Moreover, there are also people from the puppet sect. They might not agree to it. It’s extremely difficult for Lu Ming to take over the talisman Amulet sect.”</p><p>“Hmph, you mean they won’t respect Lian Cang’s life?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said coldly.</p><p>if Grandmaster Liao Cang was here, they would not dare to do so. But now, Lu Ming is just a junior. I’m afraid it’s very difficult for him to do so with just one million array illustration!</p><p>Bai Shijin sighed.</p><p>“Senior white, how would you know if you don’t try?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Alright, follow me into the talisman Amulet sect. I will gather the elders of both sects and make a decision together.”</p><p>Bai Shijin thought for a moment and said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu nodded.</p><p>let’s go! Bai Shijin tore open the space and the two of them followed him into it.</p><p>If he followed Bai Shijin, he would naturally not be attacked by the formation. Otherwise, even if he were to tear space apart, he would still be attacked by the formation.</p><p>The next moment, the space trembled. Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, and Bai Shijin appeared in a courtyard.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, Lu Ming, the two of you stay here for the night. Tomorrow, I’ll gather the higher-ups and elders of both sects to discuss and make a decision. Then, the two of you will go together!</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yan kuangtu nodded, and Bai Shijin left.</p><p>“Big brother Yan, if we enter the talisman Amulet sect like this, can we trust Bai Shijin?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Yan kuangtu.</p><p>If Bai Shijin harbored ill intentions, it would be very dangerous for them to enter this place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry about that. Bai Shijin is an old friend of my master. We have known each other for many years. He is a very loyal person. He was taught by senior Lian Cang. He is said to be a grand-disciple, but he is actually no different from a disciple. He is very loyal to senior Lian Cang!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then that’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Thus, they settled down here.</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next day, Lian Cang sent someone to bring them to the meeting hall.</p><p>In a huge Hall, more than a dozen figures were sitting.</p><p>There were men and women, middle-aged, and white-haired elders.</p><p>At the very top, on the left sat Bai Shijin, and on the right sat a white-haired old man with the air of a Sage. This old man was the current head of the puppet sect, du songjue.</p><p>The dozen or so people in the hall were the highest-ranking doyens in the talisman sect. Some of them were equivalent to Supreme-level doyens, while the weakest of them was equivalent to a peak ninth level spiritual God Realm existence.</p><p>They were the group of people with the highest status in the talisman sect.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, you gathered all of us together and said that you have something important to discuss. What is it? Can you tell me now?”</p><p>A burly middle-aged man on the right said.</p><p>This man was an elder of the puppet sect, Meng Chong. He was extremely powerful, equivalent to a Supreme-being.</p><p>As of now, the talisman Amulet sect only had a total of five Supreme-being experts. One could only imagine how powerful this person was in the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“Not everyone is here yet. I’ll tell you when everyone is here!”</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>“Not yet. The higher-ups of our two sects are all here. Who are we waiting for?”</p><p>Meng Chong said.</p><p>“He’s waiting for us!”</p><p>A rough voice came from outside the hall. Then, two figures walked in.</p><p>“Yan Kuang tu, is that you?”</p><p>As soon as Meng Chong saw Yan kuangtu, he stood up. A silver light shone between his brows, but there were traces of faint golden light mixed in the silver light. A powerful aura spread out.</p><p>The faint golden light indicated that the mental fire was about to turn golden. A golden mental fire was equivalent to a level-nine Alchemist, which was equivalent to an Emperor.</p><p>Silver with gold, equivalent to a half-step Emperor, a Supreme Being.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
