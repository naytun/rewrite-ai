It was as if it could tear the world into two.</p><p>The purple fire Bird also let out a cry and spat out a purple flame that burned everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space trembled, and countless blade lights exploded. The evil ghost will was destroyed, and ghost moon’s body appeared, floating back.</p><p>hehe, you’ve already used your trump card. Come on!</p><p>While sneering, a moon appeared above ghost moon’s head. However, this moon was extremely strange. It was black and ghostly shadows flickered on it.</p><p>However, this was not the most shocking thing. The most shocking thing was that on the pitch-black Moon, there were two golden chakras that were emitting a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Two golden chakra, second level divine level bloodline.</p><p>Ghost moon actually had a second rank divine bloodline. No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ghost moon’s figure flickered, and his body blended into the pitch-black Moon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The moon trembled, and endless black light spread out.</p><p>Each of these black lights seemed to be a blade of light, and they spread toward long Qianli and Wang haoxian.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded. The three-headed demon flood Dragon’s three heads spewed out attacks of three attributes. There were flames, lightning, and so on, which spread forward.</p><p>The purple Firebird flapped its wings and flames spread out. It was as if the space was about to be burned through.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there was a violent roar.</p><p>The stone platform below was instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>In the previous battle, everyone had intentionally controlled their Qi to prevent the stone platform from being broken. But now, they could no longer control it.</p><p>The surrounding people retreated again.</p><p>Only Lu Ming, the Blood Sword 19, and a few others stood still.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>die! a cold voice came from the Dark Moon. Everyone saw that the Dark Moon was shining with black light. Like a ghost moon falling, it pressed down on long Qianli and Wang haoxian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, the three-headed demon snake and the purple Firebird were sent flying far away. Then, they shrank rapidly and turned into the real bodies of long Qianli and Wang haoxian.</p><p>The two of them staggered back, their faces pale and they spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>They had been defeated. The two of them had joined forces, but they had both been defeated by ghost moon.</p><p>“Hehe, kill!”</p><p>The Black Moon laughed coldly and didn’t stop. It continued to press down on Wang haoxian and long Qianli, emitting terrifying waves.</p><p>Long Qianli and Wang haoxian had both been defeated, but ghost moon still continued to attack. Was she trying to kill them?</p><p>“Despicable, shameless, stop!”</p><p>“They’ve all been defeated!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings began to shout.</p><p>However, the pitch-black Moon did not seem to have any intention of stopping. It continued to attack.</p><p>Long Qianli and Wang haoxian shouted angrily and launched their attacks to resist.</p><p>However, the two of them were already injured. Now that they had transformed into their true forms, their strength was slightly weaker. How could they block it? instantly, the two of them were sent flying, and two deep pits appeared on the ground. Their faces were pale, and they coughed up another mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, the Black Moon continued to press down.</p><p>“Despicable, you still want to fight!”</p><p>Angry roars could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>Blood Sword 19 sneered.</p><p>&Nbsp; the pitch-black Moon exuded boundless might as it continued to press down.</p><p>However, at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared under the pitch-black Moon. He struck out with his palm towards the pitch-black Moon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space seemed to have been shattered, and the Black Moon trembled violently. Then, it was sent flying into the sky by the terrifying power.</p><p>This scene, in the eyes of the crowd, was like a person hitting the moon.</p><p>A palm strike that sent the moon flying.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock as they looked at the figure.</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A name appeared in everyone’s mind.</p><p>This figure was Lu Ming.</p><p>Long Qianli and Wang haoxian had been defeated, but ghost moon was still attacking. Therefore, Lu Ming had to stop her.</p><p>“It’s you! If you dare to stop me, I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>An angry roar came from the pitch-black Moon. The black light was like a blade.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stretched out his palm and all the blade gleams were shattered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and approached the moon. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The pitch-black Moon was like a rubber ball. It was sent flying high into the sky by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and his body was like a stream of light. He soared into the sky in an instant and appeared above the Black Moon. A terrifying devouring power erupted from his left hand and enveloped the Dark Moon, causing it to tremble violently.</p><p>“What’s going on? My bloodline!”</p><p>A terrified scream came from the Dark Moon.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming struck his palm heavily on the Dark Moon.</p><p>The pitch-black Moon instantly burst like a Black Balloon. Ghost moon’s figure appeared and rapidly fell to the ground.</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward, his figure falling like a meteor at high speed. The violent energy blasted ghost moon’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Ghost moon’s body heavily hit the ground. The earth shook, rocks flew, and dust filled the air.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the smoke and dust.</p><p>When the dust settled, everyone could see a huge pit that was a few hundred meters wide and a few dozen meters deep on the ground. Lu Ming stood straight in the middle of the pit, one of his feet stepping on ghost moon’s face. Ghost moon lay in the deep pit like a dead fish, blood spewing from her mouth and her body twitching non-stop.</p><p>Ghost moon had completely passed out. His body twitching was just an instinctive reaction.</p><p>The scene fell silent all of a sudden. It was so quiet that only the sound of people gasping could be heard.</p><p>GUI Yue, who had been arrogant and defeated long Qianli and Wang haoxian, was now trampled under Lu Ming’s feet like a dead fish. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>It had only been less than a minute, but the impact it gave was too strong.</p><p>Suppression. This was a complete suppression.</p><p>The next moment, the crowd burst into loud cheers.</p><p>“Haha, good hit, good Stomp!”</p><p>“This is so cool. Isn’t this ghost moon very arrogant? A new genius who wanted to step on the older geniuses to rise up is now a dead fish!”</p><p>how dare you be so arrogant in ninedragons! Don’t you know how to spell the word ‘death’? ”</p><p>Many people laughed out loud, expressing the comfortable thoughts in their hearts.</p><p>Long Qianli looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He had just fought with ghost moon and knew how terrifying she was. He and Wang haoxian were crushed even when they joined forces, but ghost moon was easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated ghost moon easily in his normal state without even using his Blood Meridian.</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He did not use his profound cultivation to suppress ghost moon, but he relied on pure combat power.</p><p>Long Qianli smiled bitterly.</p><p>It had only been half a year. Half a year ago, he had not taken Lu Ming seriously. The reason why he had brought them out of the hundred venerated mountains was entirely because of Lu Ming and the group’s loyalty, as well as ruan Tingting’s sake. That was why he had helped them.</p><p>However, in just half a year, he realized that Lu Ming had completely surpassed him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
