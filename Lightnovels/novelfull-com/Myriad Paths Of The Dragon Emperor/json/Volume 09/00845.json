He could feel a terrifying pressure from the flaming sword. This pressure was even stronger than the combined pressure of dozens of spiritual God Realm powerhouses. It was a fatal threat to him.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming roared in anger. He mustered all his strength and swung two huge cauldrons at the flaming sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom was heard as the cauldron shook and the void shattered. Endless flames filled the air and the terrifyingly high temperature twisted the space before it cracked.</p><p>The raging flames burned through the space, and the scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The majestic voice continued. Then, a middle-aged man in a purple robe stepped out of the spatial crack. He stood in the void with a flame sword in his hand.</p><p>His body was also covered in purple flames. A huge black hole appeared in the area where he was standing. There was nothing in the black hole, only an endless void.</p><p>That was because the space had been burned through by the terrifying temperature of the middle-aged man’s body.</p><p>“Paragon! That’s a Paragon!”</p><p>it’s the patriarch of the Wang family. The Supreme martial artist of the Wang family has arrived!</p><p>At the scene, waves of exclamations and roars of disbelief could be heard.</p><p>Some people’s eyes were wide open and they shouted loudly because they were too shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually lured out a Supreme-being.</p><p>A Supreme-being was someone who stood at the peak of the spiritual God Realm. They had even surpassed the spiritual God Realm and were half a step away from the martial Royal realm. Each of such a figure was an Overlord and an invincible figure.</p><p>Without martial emperors, Supreme martial artists were the strongest.</p><p>In the entire empyrean heaven divine Palace, there were only a handful of people like this.</p><p>Even such a character had appeared.</p><p>However, everyone’s shock had only just begun.</p><p>Si la! Si la …</p><p>In the sky, the space cracked continuously, and figures stepped out of the cracks.</p><p>There were five of them. Including the patriarch of the Wang clan, there were six of them in total.</p><p>The six figures stood in six different directions, each of them exuding a terrifying and overbearing aura.</p><p>There was one person who stood there like a peerless divine weapon. His sharp Qi directly cut open the space.</p><p>One of them was filled with fighting spirit, like a god of War. Another one was rather refined …</p><p>The six of them each had their own unique characteristics, but they had one thing in common: they were too powerful. Their auras were vast and mighty. Even from thousands of miles away, one could feel the terrifying pressure.</p><p>heavens, heavens, those are the family heads of the six great ancient families. They are all Supreme martial artists. All the Supreme martial artists of the six great ancient families have come out!</p><p>Someone shouted crazily.</p><p>More people were silent.</p><p>They were already numb to it. The six great masters had only appeared when they were facing an enemy Imperial Dao powerhouse. But now, they had all appeared because of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re really something. You’re the first person in history who could make the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron move because of you. Now, come with me. His Majesty force Emperor wants to see you!”</p><p>One of the middle-aged men spoke. Although his voice was calm, it was filled with dignity.</p><p>Some people recognized him as the head of the Dongfang family.</p><p>At the scene, countless people were shocked once again.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had been alerted and sent six Supreme martial artists just to see Lu Ming?</p><p>Many people were having difficulty breathing. What had happened today was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Perhaps it was because of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron! Many people were guessing.</p><p>“As expected, he’s here? He’s so fast!” Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and his mind raced.</p><p>Just as the nine Dragon bloodline rushed out and resonated with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, Lu Ming knew that the nine Dragon bloodline might be exposed. However, the other party’s speed was faster than he had imagined.</p><p>Others might think that it was because of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, but Lu Ming knew very well that Martial Emperor Di Yi was looking for him because he had found the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Di Yi wants to see me. Ask him to come here himself!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Since he had come this far, fear was useless. He might as well face it directly.</p><p>However, his words caused an earthquake.</p><p>Countless people’s eyes were wide open, and their hearts were about to jump out.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to call Martial Emperor Di Yi by his name and even asked Martial Emperor Di Yi to come and see him?</p><p>Lawless, this was lawless.</p><p>A mere spiritual ocean tier martial artist actually dared to call a Martial Emperor to see him. If a Martial Emperor wanted to see him, that would be his Supreme glory, something countless people would wish for.</p><p>They could not figure out where Lu Ming got his courage from.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He knew very well that if he went to see Martial Emperor Di Yi, he would be in grave danger. Therefore, he had nothing to fear.</p><p>evil creature, How dare you! You’re just an ant, yet you dare to talk so big. You deserve to be killed!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan shouted coldly. He was extremely overbearing and filled with killing intent.</p><p>this child is too arrogant and unruly. No matter how talented he is, if he has any achievements, he will definitely not be controlled. It’s better to just cripple him and hand him over to His Majesty!</p><p>The Jiang family’s patriarch also spoke coldly. His voice was like a divine weapon being polished, making people’s hearts beat faster.</p><p>“Hmm, since you’re so stubborn, then take him down!”</p><p>The master of the chaotic family also spoke.</p><p>“Alright, we, who will attack?”</p><p>The Jiang clan leader said.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family said, his eyes burning with fire.</p><p>The other five people nodded and took a step back.</p><p>“All of you, retreat and protect the surroundings!”</p><p>The Wang clan master’s gaze swept across the dozens of spiritual God Realm powerhouses.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Dozens of spiritual God Realm Masters retreated to various corners, ready to protect the mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Junior, since you’re so stubborn, I’ll take action personally!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As he spoke, an earth-shattering aura erupted from his body. Purple flames spread out, burning through even more space.</p><p>The flame sword in his hand grew rapidly and became 10000 meters long.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle from afar were extremely frightened and retreated madly again.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist was about to make a move. If even a wisp of energy leaked out, it would probably be a disaster. It could kill ordinary martial artists countless times. They had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The master of the Wang family swung the sword in his hand at Lu Ming.</p><p>Wherever the sword passed, the space was turned into nothingness, revealing the terrifying dark void.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook and the nine Dragon bloodline roared. Lu Ming grabbed the two cauldrons and smashed them at the Wang family master.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying clash resounded once again. The heavens and earth trembled, the cauldron shook, and endless energy scattered in all directions.</p><p>stop! dozens of spiritual God Realm Masters shouted as their hands emitted light, blocking the terrifying force.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the endless heat surging towards him. Even with the protection of the two divine cauldrons, he still felt like he was going to be burned to ashes. He took a big step back and stepped into the void.</p><p>“The Wang family’s Supreme martial artist has the upper hand. Lu Ming is going to be defeated!”</p><p>Many people were shouting madly. Who could not die in a battle with a Supreme martial artist?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
