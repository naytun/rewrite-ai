It was the treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Inside, there was a place for talisman sect disciples to buy and sell treasures.</p><p>Moreover, the materials and treasures required to cultivate the Dao of inscription were much more than those required for martial arts. Therefore, the talisman sect’s treasure Pavilion was very large and had many people.</p><p>Lu Ming landed and walked toward the hall.</p><p>There were many people in the hall.</p><p>There were many small rooms around the hall, but there were long lines.</p><p>Lu Ming could only randomly choose a place and start to queue.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s turn after half an hour.</p><p>“What do you need? Are you buying or selling materials?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked into a room. There was a counter in the room. On the counter, a young and beautiful lady smiled at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I want to buy some demonic beast blood essence,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Demonic beast blood essence, what level and how much do you need?”</p><p>The young woman asked with a smile.</p><p>There were many people who came to the talisman sect to buy demonic beast blood essence every day. It was nothing strange.</p><p>I’ll buy 50 sets of blood essence of Class 6 demonic beasts, and 50 sets of Class 7 Lv 6 demonic beasts!</p><p>Lu Ming said after thinking for a while.</p><p>“Sixth or seventh rank sixth level?” The young woman was slightly stunned.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t have any?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, there’s indeed no more blood essence of this level in stock. You’ll have to wait for a while. How about this, if you need it, you can pay a deposit in advance. After a while, when you have enough blood essence, you can come back to get it. How about it? ”</p><p>The young woman suggested.</p><p>“That’s fine too. I wonder how much it’s for?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt helpless. This was the only way now.</p><p>the blood essence of a class 6 demonic beast is 10 lower-grade raw stones for one set, and the blood essence of a class 7 Lv 6 demonic beast is 30 raw stones for one set. You can keep 500 raw stones as a deposit and collect them in seven days. What do you think? ”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and paid five hundred raw stones as a deposit.</p><p>At the same time, he sighed in his heart. Demonic beast blood essence was really expensive.</p><p>If he didn’t have the resources left behind by the nine suns Supreme Master, he really wouldn’t be able to afford it.</p><p>The Supreme shrine had been destroyed during the battle in ninedragons. However, Supreme ninesuns had kept all the items and treasures he had left in the Supreme shrine into a storage ring. Otherwise, Lu Ming would have suffered a great loss.</p><p>“Miss, I’m buying a batch of talismans!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Since he could not upgrade his Nine Dragons bloodline for the time being, he might as well buy a batch of talisman papers and inscribe some inscription talismans. It would definitely be useful in the war of Providence.</p><p>It was said that there were many restrictions in the battle of Providence.</p><p>For example, he could only bring his own inscription scrolls and runes with him. He couldn’t use the ones that others had inscribed.</p><p>Otherwise, if he brought a few inscription runes inscribed by a rank-seven or rank-eight Alchemist, there would be no need to compete. He would be able to sweep away all of them, and that would be meaningless.</p><p>Only when one inscribed it themselves could it be considered as one’s own strength and could be brought in to be used.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming bought a thousand talismans of different levels in one go and spent a hundred raw gemstones.</p><p>In comparison, talismans were much cheaper.</p><p>After purchasing the talismans, Lu Ming left the treasure Pavilion and returned to the cloud Peak Residence.</p><p>As soon as he walked in, he saw Bai chixue sitting there in a daze.</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes brightened when she saw Lu Ming. She sized him up, left, right, up, down, until Lu Ming was a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Cough cough, miss Bai, What are you looking at? I’ve only left for a short while, don’t tell me you’re already missing me?”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times and laughed.</p><p>“Miss you? You wish. Let me ask you, how did you know that the sky Fire godly sword talisman scroll needed to be modified like that?”</p><p>Bai chixue glared at Lu Ming and snorted.</p><p>“You’ve succeeded? I thought you wouldn’t follow my method!” Lu Ming said with a faint smile.</p><p>Hmph, I just gave it a try and ‘luckily’ succeeded. You haven’t told me how you knew? ”</p><p>Bai chixue asked, emphasizing on the word ‘lucky’.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed in his heart. This young lady really wanted to save face.</p><p>“Actually, I just made a wild guess,” he said with a smile.</p><p>“You guessed? Hmph, as expected!”</p><p>Bai chixue pouted and showed an expression of ‘I knew it’.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. Bai chixue believed him?</p><p>alright, don’t touch anything here. I’m going out to buy some things.</p><p>Then, he ran out like a gust of wind.</p><p>“I’ll also inscribe a batch of inscription scrolls!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a piece of snow-white talisman paper was spread on the platform. Then, he waved his fingers in the air and began to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>The talisman that Lu Ming was going to inscribe was called the fire prison talisman. It was a grade 8 level 6 trap talisman.</p><p>To be honest, this was Lu Ming’s first time inscribing a talisman scroll. However, his mind was filled with all kinds of inscription knowledge from Lian Cang. At this time, as Lu Ming moved his fingers, the knowledge was slowly displayed.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a fire prison Rune Scroll was successfully inscribed.</p><p>“Ten minutes? You’re too slow, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He felt that it was still too slow.</p><p>If this was known by others, they would be so angry that they would vomit blood.</p><p>This was a grade 8 level 6 inscription scroll and it was Lu Ming’s first time inscribing an inscription. It only took him ten minutes to do so. It was already very terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still not satisfied.</p><p>For the second one, he was a little faster and only used nine minutes.</p><p>As he continued to inscribe, the knowledge and experience in his mind began to combine with the actual operation. Lu Ming’s inscribing speed became faster and faster.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not need the help of materials to inscribe as his mental fire was extremely rich. He could replace it with mental fire.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming only needed three minutes to inscribe a fire prison talisman scroll.</p><p>This speed would scare people to death.</p><p>my mastery of mental energy fire is still not high. I’m only at the peak of minute subtlety. I need to hone myself!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>His biggest advantage was that his mental energy fire was powerful. Every level was perfect and he had Lian Cang’s cultivation experience. Therefore, his speed of inscribing was terrifying.</p><p>However, he was also clear that three minutes was his limit. If he wanted to break through, he had to make a breakthrough in the use of mental energy fire and the speed of inscribing.</p><p>In fact, he had not been practicing inscriptions for a long time. It was already a terrifying thing for him to be able to reach the peak of the refinement realm in the use of mental fire. One must know that Bai chixue was extremely talented. After more than ten years of cultivation, she was only at the late stage of the refinement realm. Even dandan had been amazed by Lu Mingming’s talent in refining.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not satisfied. What he needed to do was not something that others could compare to. Therefore, he had to do better than others.</p><p>Next, he continued to inscribe runes. This time, he inscribed the six extremes nine tier talisman scroll, the nine extremes sword formation talisman scroll.</p><p>A ninth level sixth-level talisman scroll’s attack power was already equivalent to a ninth level spiritual ocean realm martial artist’s attack power, and it was extremely difficult to refine.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
