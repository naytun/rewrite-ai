No matter how hard they tried, it was useless.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Supreme divine Palace and the palm prints of Di Yi and Martial Emperor collided. They kept shaking and more places exploded. Finally, the entire Supreme divine Palace cracked.</p><p>ah, you old fart, why aren’t you here yet? did you do it on purpose? ”</p><p>In the crowd, fatty roared repeatedly.</p><p>In the sky, Supreme nine suns and Yan kuangtu had joined forces and fought with Martial Emperor Di Yi for more than a dozen moves.</p><p>The spectators, including the six Supreme martial artists, were all shocked.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu were too powerful and abnormal. They could actually fight Martial Emperor Di Yi to this extent. It was simply terrifying.</p><p>they are destined to be defeated today. The nine suns burning their souls can temporarily unleash their full power, but they won’t last long.</p><p>The patriarch of the Jiang family coldly said.</p><p>it’s unwise to fight a Martial Emperor before becoming one. No matter how strong he is, he will still be defeated. Since ancient times, no one in the Supreme realm has been able to defeat a Martial Emperor. It’s impossible to even contend with him.</p><p>The head of the chaotic family also said.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Supreme shrine trembled more and more violently as it continued to collapse and explode. The remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme started to shake, as if it would dissipate at any moment.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu gritted his teeth and protected Lu Ming. He charged forward with all his might, but his body trembled and blood flowed out of the Golden crow’s mouth.</p><p>The situation was getting worse.</p><p>damn it, you old fart. You must have done it on purpose. I don’t care anymore. I’ll risk it!</p><p>The fat man cursed. Finally, he gritted his teeth and rushed out of the crowd, madly rushing toward the battlefield of Martial Emperor Di Yi and nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Fatty, what are you doing?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting cried out in shock.</p><p>Beside him, the others also looked at fatty as if he was crazy.</p><p>This fatty actually dared to rush into the battlefield of Supreme martial artists and martial emperors. This was a blatant death wish. As long as he was hit by a wisp of Qi, he would definitely end up in ashes.</p><p>He was crazy.</p><p>However, the Fatty’s eyes revealed a fierce look as he muttered, ” old man, I know you don’t want to get involved in this mess, but now your dearest, only disciple is about to die. Let’s see if you still want to care!</p><p>Fatty growled and rushed towards the battlefield.</p><p>In the surroundings, countless gazes were attracted by fatty and fell on him.</p><p>Everyone was thinking that this fatty was crazy.</p><p>The eyes of the Supreme-beings flashed, but they didn’t stop him.</p><p>This ant-like thing was courting death. Why did they have to stop him? once he got close to the battlefield, he would die.</p><p>As the fatty neared the battlefield, a terrifying force, the aftermath of the battle, swept across the void. Wherever the force passed, the void collapsed, and a dark and ferocious spatial crack swept towards the fatty.</p><p>“Old fart, if you still don’t come, this Lord will die Here!”</p><p>The fat man roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space behind the fat man cracked open, and a huge axe slashed out from the void. The space crack was destroyed by the axe. The axe did not stop and continued to slash toward Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s face turned serious. He waved his palm, and a shocking sword radiance burst out, clashing with the huge axe.</p><p>It was as if the heavens and earth had been split apart as an incomparably bright light shone out. The space crumbled continuously as an endless amount of energy entered the void.</p><p>At the same time, the sword ray and the axe also canceled each other out and disappeared.</p><p>“Heavens, this …”</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Who was it? He could actually fight with Martial Emperor Di Yi?</p><p>Behind the fatty, a tall figure stepped out from the spatial crack.</p><p>This was an old man with a messy white beard on his face. However, his body was extremely fat, and he was simply an old version of Kong Jin.</p><p>He stood beside the fat man, exuding a terrifying and Supreme aura. This aura was very similar to that of Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Emperor, this was a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Countless people’s hearts twitched. Everything that happened today was beyond their imagination.</p><p>In the beginning, it was the spiritual God Masters who appeared. Then, the Supremes appeared. In the end, even the nine suns Supreme and Martial Emperor Di Yi appeared. Now, another sovereign way master had appeared.</p><p>And all of this was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Because of this young man, these unrivaled figures appeared one after another.</p><p>It made many people feel like they were dreaming.</p><p>“Old monster mo Tian, this matter has nothing to do with you. You want to be my enemy?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi looked at the fat old man.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s words shocked even more people.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign. This old man was actually the demonic sky sovereign.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign was an extremely famous and invincible master in the eastern barren territory. He was even more famous than Martial Emperor Di Yi. He was a genuine Martial Emperor master.</p><p>However, the devil Sky Emperor did not like to establish his own forces. He preferred to live in seclusion and his whereabouts were uncertain. Almost no one knew where he was.</p><p>In the past thousands of years, the demonic sky Emperor had disappeared without a trace. No one had ever seen him.</p><p>There were rumors that the demonic sky Emperor had probably reached the end of his lifespan and had already died.</p><p>For thousands of years, countless people in the eastern barren territory had recognized this fact.</p><p>He had never thought that after thousands of years, the devil Sky Emperor would actually appear again and not die at all.</p><p>The lifespan of a King’s realm cultivator was a thousand years.</p><p>At the spirit sea realm, one’s lifespan was two thousand years, and at the spirit embryo realm, one’s lifespan was three thousand years.</p><p>At the spiritual God Realm, one’s lifespan could reach up to 5000 years.</p><p>However, once he broke through to the martial Royal realm, his lifespan would be greatly increased, reaching more than 10000 years.</p><p>However, the lifespan of a martial Royal realm martial artist was uncertain. The shorter ones could only live for 10000 years, while the longer ones could even live for 20000 years.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign was definitely more than 15000 years old. That was why many people thought that he had died.</p><p>haha, Di Yi, you are an Emperor path expert. Is it interesting to make things difficult for a few juniors? It’s so embarrassing!”</p><p>The devil Sky King chuckled.</p><p>“This is a matter of my empyrean heaven divine Palace. It’s not your place to worry about it. Please do as you wish!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi said coldly.</p><p>“Old man … “No, master, that Lu Ming is my brother. We have sworn to live and die together. No matter what, we have to save him today. Otherwise, you’ll lose me, your disciple!”</p><p>The fatty cried out.</p><p>“I can’t interfere with the matters of your empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, that little fellow is my disciple’s brother. If he dies, my disciple will die as well. I’m in a very difficult position. How about this? I don’t care about your disciples and Grand-disciples, but I want to take that little fellow away!”</p><p>Demonic sky old freak pointed at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Demonic sky old monster, it seems like you want to be my enemy?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s face darkened.</p><p>His target was Lu Ming. How could he let demonic sky old monster take him away?</p><p>“Di Yi, so what if I’m your enemy? You’re just a clone now, and your main body is far away overseas, right? Do you think I’m afraid of you?”</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign grinned and stepped forward. His aura exploded, and a battle-axe appeared in his hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
