The person who retreated was actually aokun.</p><p>...</p><p>Aokun was actually forced to take seven steps back by Lu Ming’s punch. How was this possible?</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s body only swayed a little.</p><p>In a fist-to-fist exchange, Lu Ming actually had the upper hand. Was Lu Ming still human? He was simply a beast in human form.</p><p>as expected of a flood Dragon with 50% true dragon bloodline. It’s really powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>His cultivation was one level higher than ao kun’s, and he had already used 80% of his vital essence. With the prison-suppressing heaven technique, which was equivalent to a high-grade divine martial technique, he was so powerful that even ao Qian and GUI Yue had been beaten to the point of vomiting blood, let alone the geniuses who were one level lower than him.</p><p>However, aokun only took seven steps back.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had met someone whose cultivation level was lower than his but could still block his attack.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Aokun was extremely shocked. However, after the shock, it was followed by endless anger.</p><p>He, aokun, was a God’s favored one. He had 50% of the true dragon’s bloodline in his body and his talent was heaven-defying. Now, in a head-on collision, he was forced to retreat by Lu Ming. This was unforgivable.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Aokun let out a Dragon’s Roar. The muscles on his body tightened and swelled up, pushing up his red armor. His blood rushed into the sky and he actually turned into a true dragon, roaring in the sky.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. His huge fist, wrapped in a layer of red light, was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This punch was even more overbearing and shocking.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s spirit ocean, the primordial Qi in his body churned. The primordial Qi in his body burst out and let out a tsunami-like sound. He used his fist to activate the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fists collided for the second time, stirring up a storm.</p><p>Tens of thousands of eyes were once again fixed on him.</p><p>Who would have the upper hand this time?</p><p>In the hurricane, a figure stepped onto the battle stage and retreated. This time, he retreated nine steps. It was still aokun.</p><p>Aokun was forced back once more, and even further.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, his figure only swayed a little.</p><p>Shock. Other than shock, there was more shock. Lu Ming had actually suppressed aokun.</p><p>In the Emperor sky divine Palace, the eyes of di Feng and a few of the strongest people shone brightly.</p><p>Although they had already heard that Lu Ming had easily defeated GUI Yue of the heavenly corpse sect, they did not think too highly of him. His name was not even on the list of ten people at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>However, they realized that they had greatly underestimated Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, it was hard to find someone stronger than him among the experts at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The paragons of the heavenly corpse sect were also shocked.</p><p>The most shocked ones were the sky demon Valley’s elites.</p><p>They knew how strong aokun was. With 50% true dragon bloodline, if he grew up, he would definitely become one of the pillars of the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Now, he was suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I want you to die!”</p><p>Aokun howled and his body grew rapidly. In the end, he turned into a 500 meter long red flood Dragon.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Its huge claws, which were as large as mountains, swiped at Lu Ming, causing the space to tremble.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch collided with the flood dragon’s claw. His body trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>Aokun, who had returned to his original form, was stronger in all aspects.</p><p>Aokun’s huge dragon body gave off a blood-red light. It was like the will of blood. This was the natural fighting technique of Dragons.</p><p>He roared and pounced on Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Then I’ll suppress you!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. The prison-suppressing stele bloodline appeared above his head, and two rays of golden light shone brightly.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They were not shocked at how advanced Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was. Instead, they were shocked that his Blood Meridian was too low-level.</p><p>Today was a gathering of geniuses. Divine level bloodlines had appeared frequently, and everyone was already numb to it.</p><p>A second level divine rank bloodline was nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. Everyone had thought that Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian should be a fourth level divine level Blood Meridian, or at least a third level divine level Blood Meridian. They had never expected that Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was only a second level divine level Blood Meridian.</p><p>It was unbelievable that a second level divine bloodline could be so powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled. Lu Ming’s body turned into a ray of light and merged with the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline. The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline exuded a terrifying pressure.</p><p>It was vast and heavy, as if it could suppress everything.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and collided with the Water dragon’s claw.</p><p>Aokun hollered, his giant dragon body actually shook like a wave and he retreated.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele continued to shake and flew into the sky. It grew rapidly and finally became 10000 meters tall. Like an ancient mountain, it pressed down on aokun.</p><p>Aokun hollered in rage. He felt a terrifying pressure and his body was filled with energy. He hollered and charged into the sky.</p><p>The Dragon was in the sky, trying to fight with the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, aokun was like a crawling worm. He was suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele and smashed into the fighting ring.</p><p>?…</p><p>A strange sound was heard. It was like a Toad being hit by an iron hammer. It was accompanied by a shrill scream.</p><p>The battle stage rumbled and the heavens and earth shook. Aokun cried out in pain as blood splattered everywhere. He was almost crushed alive. Blood spurted out from his huge mouth like it was free.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and continued to attack. The sound of the bone armor breaking could be heard. Aokun spat out even more blood. The flood dragon’s blood dyed the fighting stage red.</p><p>Aokun cried out in pain. He was already half dead and laid on the battle stage without moving. Only his eyes were still filled with shock.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk and transformed back into Lu Ming’s figure, stepping on the dragon’s head.</p><p>Many people gasped in shock.</p><p>He won. After Lu Ming used the blood Meridian fusion, he easily defeated aokun and won.</p><p>It was shocking that the demon race’s prodigy, who had a fifty percent true dragon bloodline purity, was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people were guessing what Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was. Prison-guarding stele? What kind of bloodline was it? he had never heard of such a bloodline. It was too terrifying and its power was shocking.</p><p>The moment he used bloodline fusion, he easily suppressed aokun.</p><p>The divine monument expanded to 10000 meters, and a flood Dragon was suppressed below it. It was like a myth.</p><p>“Now, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. The infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hand. The sharp tip of the spear was aimed at aokun’s forehead.</p><p>“No, don’t, help!”</p><p>Aokun hollered.</p><p>He had half of the true dragon’s bloodline. He was a peerless genius of the monster race. He didn’t want to die. He still had a bright future.</p><p>With his talent, it was certain that he would advance to level eight in the future and stand shoulder to shoulder with the human spiritual God Realm. He could even break through to the Supreme realm. He also had an ambition to break through to the Supreme demon Emperor’s position and become an Emperor, ruling the world.</p><p>He still had so many goals that he had yet to achieve, so how could he die?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
