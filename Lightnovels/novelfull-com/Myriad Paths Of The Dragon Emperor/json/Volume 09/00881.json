They had only passed the twelfth level. The difference was too great.</p><p>The rest of the people around the square kept their mouths shut. Those who said that Lu Ming was just relying on his judgment also kept their mouths shut.</p><p>How could he break the formation so quickly just by relying on his eyesight? Even they themselves did not believe it.</p><p>“Dammit! Detestable!”</p><p>In the crowd, sunrise was roaring in anger. The other paragons who had been beaten up by Lu Ming before also had ugly expressions.</p><p>The number of levels that Lu Ming had cleared was still rising rapidly.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming successfully broke through level twenty-four and rushed to level twenty-five.</p><p>At this level, Lu Ming’s speed finally slowed down a little.</p><p>This made many people let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s speed of breaking the array was still as crazy as before, they would really doubt whether Lu Ming was still human.</p><p>It was normal to be slower. Even if it was just a little slower, they would feel much more comfortable.</p><p>In the myriad formations Pagoda, there was a desert. Lu Ming stood in the middle of the desert. The strong wind whistled, blowing the desert and filling the air with sand and dust.</p><p>Every grain of sand was shining with light, as if every grain of sand had been set up with a formation.</p><p>The difficulty of cracking this was rather high.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shimmering with light. Endless wild sand appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>His fingers moved, and thousands of phantoms appeared in the space. Countless inscriptions were born from his fingertips, rushing in all directions and disappearing into the dust.</p><p>Just now, Ji mai took a full hour to pass level 25.</p><p>However, ten minutes later, the strong wind stopped and the desert disappeared. Lu Ming appeared on the twenty-sixth floor.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Ji mai said, his eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites, such as Yan Tong, Meng Jia, and H Ming, were shocked.</p><p>They had all reached the twenty-fifth level and knew how difficult it was. However, Lu Ming had only used ten minutes to pass it. It was terrifying.</p><p>“I wonder how many levels tianyun will be able to reach?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>No one said anything, even those who liked to make comments before.</p><p>The key was that the previous remarks they made about Lu Ming were never accurate. They were also blushing and ashamed. How would they dare to express their opinions easily? they might be slapped in the face by Lu Ming again. It was better to watch quietly!</p><p>Twenty-six, twenty-seven …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had passed the levels and surpassed Ji mai, who was previously in first place. Moreover, the time he used was much shorter than Ji mai.</p><p>However, this did not stop. The challenge continued.</p><p>Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three …</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had cleared the thirty-third level and entered the thirty-fourth level.</p><p>it’s the last three levels. I heard that the last three levels are extremely difficult. Even the other 13 zongzis have not been able to pass them. The strongest stopped at the 35th level.</p><p>that’s right. Although it’s only the intermediate level, the difficulty of the last three levels is also very terrifying!</p><p>I estimate that the heavenly cloud Pavilion will stop at the thirty-fifth level at most!</p><p>As the crowd discussed, some people couldn’t help but express their opinions.</p><p>At that moment, the last batch of people had already come out. Lu Ming was the only one in the myriad formations tower.</p><p>Among them, Bai chixue made it to the 25th floor, which was quite an achievement.</p><p>Bai chixue’s talent was amazing, otherwise, she would not have been accepted as a disciple by Bai Shijin, a leader of a sect and a Supreme Master.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.</p><p>he’s moving! Tianyun has charged through!</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>The number behind Lu Ming’s name had changed to ’35’!</p><p>Thirty-fifth step. This was already the record for the strongest heaven’s pride expert of this generation.</p><p>In the myriad formations Pagoda, light shone and countless inscriptions flickered. A large formation emerged, forming a terrifying saber radiance that slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Each of these blade lights could easily kill an existence at the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>And here, there were hundreds of blades shining.</p><p>Of course, if one was hit by the blade light here, they would not really die. They would only fail to pass the level and be transported out.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and his fingers moved quickly. Runes appeared one after another, forming a large array.</p><p>Shields appeared and blocked Lu Ming’s surroundings. The saber beams were blocked by the shields.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming began to step forward and form an array. He searched for the weaknesses of the big arrays and began to crack them.</p><p>However, the formation on this level seemed to be endless. After one was broken, another one would appear.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously inscribed runes and continued to crack them at a very fast speed.</p><p>Time passed by slowly. Two hours later, no new array appeared. Lu Ming successfully cleared the thirty-fifth level and appeared on the thirty-sixth level.</p><p>At this moment, the outside world was in an uproar. Lu Ming had actually passed through the thirty-fifth level and entered the thirty-sixth level, breaking the record of this generation.</p><p>Of course, the other 13 zongzis hadn’t cleared the intermediate level of the all formations Pagoda for many years. The records they left behind were all from many years ago.</p><p>Otherwise, the 13 zongzis, who were ranked in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents, would definitely be able to pass the medium difficulty level of the thousand formations Pagoda. Even if they were powerful, they could still pass it.</p><p>Another three hours passed, and on the Jade tablet, tianyun’s name glowed brilliantly, emitting a golden light.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming had cleared the level.</p><p>A wave of shocking cheers and shouts of disbelief erupted from the audience. Lu Ming had actually cleared the level?</p><p>Was his Dao of inscription also so terrifying? Or was his eyesight already so terrifying that he could accurately find the weakness of the formation?</p><p>The thousand formations Pagoda shone with a golden light and Lu Ming was teleported out.</p><p>Countless eyes were on Lu Ming. At this moment, some people had already revealed looks of admiration.</p><p>In the second round, without a doubt, Lu Ming came in first.</p><p>Then, Meng Chong announced the names of the people who passed the second round.</p><p>There were a total of 200 people.</p><p>Out of more than 1500 people, only 200 people successfully advanced. The rest were all eliminated. The elimination rate was really high.</p><p>now, the 200 who have advanced will proceed to the third round. The third round will be a battle of strength!</p><p>Meng Chong announced. Then, he waved his hand. In the center of the White jade square, inscriptions glowed, and a huge, bronze, ancient fighting ring appeared.</p><p>Then, Meng Chong announced the rules.</p><p>The third round was a test of overall strength.</p><p>Formations, puppets, inscription talismans, and spirit weapons could all be used. However, there was one point. Inscription talismans had to be made by the user. The winner would advance and the loser would be eliminated.</p><p>Until the top three were selected, they would be rewarded with the opportunity to cultivate on the observatory.</p><p>As for who would fight who, it was completely up to Meng Chong.</p><p>“Now, whoever’s name I call will go up the stage!”</p><p>Meng Chong announced as he swept his gaze across the crowd.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>“Tianyun!”</p><p>Meng Chong called out the first name.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
