Countless people were shocked.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>On eight of the Dragon veins, there were eight Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons. All of them were shaking.</p><p>All of a sudden, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron closest to Lu Ming shook the most intensely, sending gravel flying. The divine cauldron actually left the ground, tore through the void, and disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, in the depths of the six great ancient families, the eyes of the six family heads suddenly flashed.</p><p>the strange bloodline of a true dragon. This is the child that His Majesty was talking about!</p><p>The six of them spoke almost at the same time. Then, they stood up and stepped forward.</p><p>When they took a step forward, a crack automatically appeared in the space. They stepped into the crack and disappeared.</p><p>A million miles away, fatty was roaring.</p><p>“Ah, break!”</p><p>His chubby body swelled up, and his eyes turned red. The battle-axe in his hand slashed out crazily.</p><p>At the same time, Wang haoxian, ruan Tingting, and Qiao Xuan also assisted him in attacking the formation that trapped them.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The fat man spat a mouthful of blood onto the battle-ax, causing it to become even more powerful. A terrifying axe light shot out, as if it could split the heavens and earth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Smoke and dust filled the air, and the formation collapsed with a loud bang. The formation was broken.</p><p>“Let’s go to the ocean waves ancient garden!”</p><p>The fatty roared as the group of them flew towards the ocean waves ancient garden at high speed.</p><p>……</p><p>In the sky above the ocean waves ancient garden.</p><p>“This kid is demonic! Attack!”</p><p>Shangguan Zhongyuan roared.</p><p>At that moment, the remaining spiritual God powerhouses appeared around Lu Ming and surrounded him.</p><p>There were a total of thirteen spirit God experts.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Just as they were about to make a move, a tremor came from the sky, and another huge cauldron descended.</p><p>“Again … Another Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron? how is that possible?”</p><p>the second one, the second one. Could it be that Lu Ming can control the second one? ”</p><p>Everyone was so shocked that they almost jumped up.</p><p>“Come, accompany me in battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and stretched out his right hand, grabbing one of the legs of the second Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>He grabbed one in each hand. The two huge Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were like two huge iron hammers in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“You old man, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on Shangguan Zhongyuan and strode forward. The cauldron was like a giant hammer, smashing toward Shangguan Zhongyuan.</p><p>This old man was filled with killing intent the moment he appeared. He could not wait to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>It was because of his instigation that the other spiritual God Realm powerhouses took action one after another. Otherwise, there would not be so many spiritual God Realm powerhouses besieging him.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!” Shangguan Zhongyuan’s expression changed drastically. He let out a loud roar, and the Starlight began to boil. A huge crack seemed to have appeared in the sky, and a beam of Starlight fell down onto Shangguan Zhongyuan’s body.</p><p>The light of the stars gathered and turned into countless starry swords, which were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other twelve experts also made their moves. All sorts of attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two cauldrons danced in Lu Ming’s hands. One of them was mainly used to block the attacks of the others, while the other one was used to smash Shangguan Zhongyuan.</p><p>He only focused on one person and madly attacked.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons let out a long roar. It seemed to have some kind of resonance with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, causing its power to increase greatly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the huge cauldron smashed down, all of Shangguan Zhongyuan’s attacks were rendered useless. The huge cauldron, which was as big as a mountain, smashed down on Shangguan Zhongyuan. A terrifying force emanated from the cauldron and locked onto Shangguan Zhongyuan, making it impossible for him to Dodge. He could only take the attack head-on.</p><p>His eyes revealed a trace of shock. The power of the stars burst out madly, and his fists were like two stars, blasting toward the huge cauldron.</p><p>However, the moment it came into contact with the cauldron, the Starlight was extinguished and Shangguan Zhongyuan’s fists were instantly shattered. He screamed in pain as his body was sent flying.</p><p>&Nbsp; boom boom boom …</p><p>The other people’s attacks were all blocked by Lu Ming’s other Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, and it was blocked firmly.</p><p>With the eruption of the nine Dragon bloodlines and the increase in the number of divine cauldrons, the power had also increased to a terrifying level.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the void and continued to charge towards Shangguan Zhong.</p><p>The massive cauldron blotted out the sky and pierced through the void before crashing down on Shangguan Zhongyuan. The terrifying aura it exuded caused Shangguan Zhongyuan’s heart to tremble.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Shangguan Zhongyuan roared. He could feel death approaching, and this feeling was driving him crazy.</p><p>He was here today to kill Lu Ming, not to court death.</p><p>He roared and a ferocious Tiger star appeared above his head. On the body of this ferocious Tiger star, there were three golden Meridian cycles.</p><p>A third rank divine bloodline was considered weak in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Shangguan Zhongyuan transformed into the ferocious Tiger star, hoping to block the attack. However, in the next moment, he lost all hope. As the huge cauldron pressed down, the Tiger star crumbled and returned to his human form. Under the immense pressure, his body started to crack.</p><p>With a bang, his entire body exploded, and his body and spirit were destroyed.</p><p>Countless people who witnessed this scene felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>A spiritual God Realm powerhouse was killed just like that. He died just like that. He was smashed to death by Lu Ming’s cauldron. This was too unbelievable.</p><p>Especially the disciples of the Shangguan family, who were at the scene. Their faces were pale and they were terrified.</p><p>The other 12 spiritual God Realm Masters were also terrified. They quickly retreated, and the 12 of them combined their auras.</p><p>Shangguan Zhongyuan’s outcome had shocked them.</p><p>If Lu Ming could kill one person, he could kill a second. The twelve of them did not dare to split up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, whistling sounds could be heard in the sky. This time, at least twenty figures appeared in the sky, each of them exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>Spiritual God Realm. They were all spiritual God Realm experts. More spiritual God Realm experts had arrived.</p><p>These experts descended and met up with the twelve experts from before. Their powerful auras enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two cauldrons trembled, and the nine Dragon bloodlines roared as they felt the terrifying pressure.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight to the end today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He held a cauldron in each hand and faced the 30-odd spiritual God Realm powerhouses fearlessly.</p><p>“You’re young, but you’re quite ambitious. Unfortunately, you’ve used it in the wrong place!”</p><p>An extremely majestic voice suddenly resounded in the world.</p><p>It wasn’t the spiritual God Realm powerhouses who spoke, it was someone else. No one knew where the voice came from, but it seemed to exist between heaven and earth.</p><p>However, almost everyone’s heart tightened when they heard this voice, as if they were facing a terrifying existence.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The next moment, the space in the sky suddenly split open. A purple flame sword flew out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
