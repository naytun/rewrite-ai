He usually neglected his cultivation. Now was a good time to try and see if this energy could improve his physical body.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming activated the ten thousand spirit combat body. Suddenly, the energy seemed to have found a vent and seeped into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body began to wriggle and expand. His bones and bones made cracking sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly feel that his physical body was rapidly becoming stronger and was starting to improve.</p><p>Half an hour later, the energy of the giant elephant was finally completely refined.</p><p>“Eighth-grade body!”</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Indeed, the devoured energy could also cultivate the physical body.</p><p>How much more resources would he have to save in the future?</p><p>In the future, the resources could be used to buy other things, such as buying spiritual liquid and cultivating the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Lu Ming simply wanted to laugh out loud.</p><p>legend has it that in order to break through to the martial Royal realm, one’s physical body must reach the peak of the ninth grade. This is one of the basic conditions!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Many spiritual God Realm Masters would put in great effort to cultivate their physical body, because it was impossible to enter the martial Royal realm without reaching the peak of the ninth grade.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was still very far away from this. It was not the time to think about this. It was enough as long as he could improve.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons didn’t advance!</p><p>After refining the essence blood of the elephant, his nine Dragon bloodline didn’t level up. This was the essence blood of a level Seven demonic beast.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian needed a huge amount of blood essence to level up. He could not afford to buy blood essence.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and the path-understanding ancient tree appeared. He sat in front of the tree and began to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming began his days of arduous cultivation in the vicious beasts forest.</p><p>Once he had an inspiration, he would stop cultivating. After cultivating for a few days, he would go hunting demonic beasts to hone his martial arts.</p><p>Meanwhile, dandan was scurrying around in the mountains, looking for spirit herbs.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time, and time flew by quickly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had been two months and twenty days since Lu Ming entered the ferocious beasts secret realm.</p><p>There were only ten days left until the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>A figure flew out from a Clear Lake and stood on the shore. With a shake of his true essence, not a single drop of water was left on his body.</p><p>Then, he changed into a blue robe, and a graceful young master suddenly appeared on the shore.</p><p>This person was, of course, Lu Ming, who had been cultivating in the ferocious beast secret realm for nearly three months.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was already twenty-two years old. His face was sharp and angular. He was much more mature than before and looked more determined.</p><p>“It’s time to go out. The battle of karmic luck is finally coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and felt the surging power in his body. There was a hint of anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>Dandan landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder, her mouth filled with the fragrance of medicine. haha, I’ve recovered a little more. When I’ve recovered more, watch how I’ll torture those so-called so-called geniuses. I’ll also blow that Martial Emperor Di Yi to death!</p><p>As he spoke, he even burped.</p><p>During this period of time, he had really found quite a number of high-grade spirit herbs. He had been eating spirit herbs every day and was living a very comfortable life.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and headed towards the exit of the fierce beasts forest.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming left the ferocious beasts forest, his expression changed and he took out a Jade voice transmission talisman.</p><p>“Fatty is here, I almost forgot!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The moment he came out, he received a message from fatty. It seemed like he had been cut off in the mystic realm.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately flew out of the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>At the edge of the mountain, there was a huge formation platform, which was guarded by strong cultivators of the mountain. They kept the formation running smoothly.</p><p>“Several seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“So it’s sky cloud zongzi. Are you going out?”</p><p>An old man opened his eyes and said.</p><p>I have a few friends who are here to participate in the battle of Providence. I want to bring them in!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, take this token and you can freely enter and exit the great formation of Mount Liang Yi. However, this token has a restriction. At most, you can only bring in spirit embryo realm experts. Those stronger than you will be blocked!</p><p>A token flew out of the elder’s hand and Lu Ming caught it.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his gratitude and stepped out.</p><p>When he walked out of the mount Liangyi, a ripple suddenly appeared in the originally peaceful space. Lu Ming took a step and stepped out.</p><p>He flew forward and came to a small city ten thousand miles away. He saw fatty, and of course, ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we finally get to see you. We’ve been here since five days ago. We’ve been sending you voice transmissions but there’s been no news!”</p><p>The moment the fatty saw Lu Ming, he burst into laughter. He wanted to give Lu Ming a bear hug but was almost sent flying by Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting walked over and greeted him with a smile.</p><p>“Tingting!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded.</p><p>He realized that both fatty and ruan Tingting’s auras were much more powerful than they were half a year ago.</p><p>This was especially so for the fatty. Lu Ming could sense a terrifying aura from him. This aura was hidden deep within the Fatty’s body. Lu Ming could sense a trace of it with his sensitive spiritual mind.</p><p>This aura seemed to be able to destroy everything and was extremely sharp.</p><p>It seemed that both fatty and ruan Tingting had made great progress under the guidance of the devil Sky Emperor.</p><p>After all, this was the emperor’s personal teaching. How many people in the world could do that?</p><p>“Fatty, you’ve awakened your third bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ve awakened. Hehe, Lu Ming, I’m not afraid of you now!”</p><p>The fatty grinned.</p><p>“Oh? What level is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’s a secret for now. I’m sure you’ll be surprised in the battle of Providence!</p><p>The fatty chuckled, his face mysterious.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>On the side, ruan Tingting looked at him in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming also gave the fatty the middle finger.</p><p>“Tingting, you’ve also awakened a divine bloodline, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at ruan Tingting.</p><p>He could also sense a powerful aura from ruan Tingting.</p><p>en, I only managed to luckily awaken it with the help of senior mo Tian. It’s a third level divine level!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said. Immediately after, a trace of Qi appeared on her body and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s cultivation had already reached the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm. Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The demonic sky sovereign’s methods were indeed unpredictable. In just half a year, not only did he allow ruan Tingting to successfully awaken a third level divine rank bloodline, but he also allowed her cultivation to break through to the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Half a year ago, ruan Tingting’s cultivation was only at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The speed of his progress was extremely shocking.</p><p>This was the means of an Emperor, difficult to fathom.</p><p>From the looks of it, Fatty’s gains were probably even greater. After all, Fatty’s talent was higher than ruan Tingting’S. No wonder this guy was deliberately mystifying things. His gains were most likely astonishing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
