His huge body struggled madly and retreated. In a few breaths, he was out of the fighting ring and returned to his human form. He looked at fatty with hatred.</p><p>...</p><p>A huge Dragon Claw was left on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Damn it, you should die!”</p><p>Ao Feng shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a figure landed heavily on the fighting ring, exuding a strong killing intent.</p><p>The figure was wearing red armor. It was the young man who had provoked Lu Ming with ao Qian.</p><p>“Damn fatty, you’ve completely angered me!”</p><p>The red-armored young man’s voice was cold, and there was a hint of madness in it.</p><p>The aura it revealed was also at the peak fifth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>my name is aokun. Fat pig, do you dare to fight me? ”</p><p>The red armored youth stared at the fatty.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He felt that this young man was not simple.</p><p>He was indeed at the peak fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, but he was extremely arrogant. He knew that Lu Ming had defeated ao Qian, yet he still dared to provoke Lu Ming. He was definitely not simple.</p><p>“Fatty, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the fatty.</p><p>Fatty’s eyes flashed and he grinned, ” “Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment fatty said that, aokun stepped forward and punched out.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast. Aokun’s body and fist seemed to be connected. With a punch, he appeared in front of fatty and his fist was aimed at Fatty’s arm.</p><p>He was going to cripple Fatty’s arm.</p><p>The Fatty’s expression changed. He didn’t expect his opponent to be so fast. At the critical moment, he could only lift his axe to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Aokun’s fist landed on Fatty’s battle axe, causing it to shake violently. Fatty’s face changed and his body was sent flying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Aokun stomped heavily on the ground. He was like an ancient beast, charging towards the fatty in a brutal way. He punched towards the Fatty’s arm.</p><p>Fatty roared in anger. His body swelled up and he swung his battle-axe like the wind.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Aokun’s fist was even harder than a divine weapon. When it collided with the battle axe, a loud boom was heard. In the violent shaking, fatty let out a pained cry. He couldn’t hold the battle axe and it flew far away. He retreated and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Countless people’s expressions changed. This scene was too shocking.</p><p>Just now, Fatty’s combat power was obvious to all. Although he had not awakened a divine bloodline, he still defeated a flood Dragon that had 10% of a divine beast bloodline. It could be said that he had shocked everyone.</p><p>But now, in front of aokun, he couldn’t even fight back?</p><p>Without a doubt, aokun was a descendant with a strong God beast bloodline. The key was, how thick was it to be so terrifying?</p><p>“I’ll cripple your four limbs!”</p><p>Aokun shouted coldly and charged towards fatty.</p><p>“Fatty, step down from the fighting stage and admit defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the fatty.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing’s brows were tightly furrowed, while ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan’s hearts were in their mouths.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Fatty took a step forward and his fat body retreated rapidly. However, aokun’s speed was too terrifying. He caught up to fatty in an instant and threw out another terrifying punch.</p><p>He didn’t do anything, just a simple punch. However, aokun’s physical strength was just too terrifying.</p><p>The fat man roared as an ancient shield appeared in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Aokun’s fist landed on the ancient shield and sent it flying. The ancient shield smashed into Fatty’s body and almost flattened him. His body was also sent flying.</p><p>This time, he was thrown out of the fighting ring and fell heavily out of the ring.</p><p>Ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan immediately flew over and helped fatty up.</p><p>“Fatty, you’re not dead, are you?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting asked with concern.</p><p>Fatty coughed out a few more mouthfuls of blood. His face was pale as he said, ” “It’s fine, it’s no big deal. My skin is thick!”</p><p>“Hmph, you’re lucky this time!”</p><p>Aokun stood on the battle stage and looked down at fatty, saying coldly.</p><p>“What are you so arrogant for? If I awaken a divine bloodline, I’ll torture you like an insect!”</p><p>The fat man shouted, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>Fatty was not one to suffer losses. This time, he had been defeated so miserably by someone of the same level, mainly because he had not awakened his third bloodline.</p><p>“Fatty, I’ll avenge you after the exchange!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and cast a cold glance at aokun.</p><p>Aokun looked straight into Lu Ming’s eyes and smiled coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming, fatty, and the rest returned to the grandstand. Fatty began to heal his injuries.</p><p>“Who else wants to come up for a fight?”</p><p>Aokun looked around and planned to continue challenging.</p><p>There was complete silence.</p><p>Although there were still a few people from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and heavenly corpse sect who had yet to fight, they were all ordinary heaven’s pride experts. The combat strength that aokun had displayed just now was simply too terrifying. If they went up, wouldn’t they just be looking for a beating?</p><p>No one from either side went up.</p><p>“Let the heavenly demon Valley win this round!”</p><p>Di Feng helplessly replied.</p><p>In the battle of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, the sky demon Valley won.</p><p>However, aokun had no plans to head down. He looked around and said, ” “Since that’s the case, I’ll challenge your sixth level spiritual ocean tier expert now. Let’s fight!”</p><p>“What? You’re at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and you want to challenge someone at the sixth level?”</p><p>“He’s too arrogant!”</p><p>The surrounding crowd shouted unhappily.</p><p>“Brother Peng, he’s at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm. Is he really going to participate in the battle of the sixth level?”</p><p>Di Feng frowned as he looked at the Golden-robed young man.</p><p>“That’s right. Among the ten people at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm, aokun’s name is there. Among the sixth level, aokun’s name is also there. It should be fine for a lower-level to participate in a high-level battle, right?”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth laughed.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Di Feng nodded.</p><p>It was naturally fine for a lower-level to participate in a high-level battle, as long as he was willing.</p><p>Aokun wanted to participate in a battle at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean realm as a fifth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>“Who’s going to fight!”</p><p>Aokun looked around.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A voice rang out. From the side of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, a young man flew up onto the battle platform.</p><p>There was no lack of geniuses in the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect had many experts.</p><p>This young man was the Supreme talent of Di Tian’s Imperial Guards. He had awakened a second-rank divine bloodline and was extremely powerful.</p><p>The next moment, the two figures collided.</p><p>However, the result of the battle was shocking. In just a few moves, the Imperial Guard was forced to retreat. In the end, he even used bloodline fusion, but it was also useless. He was forced back to his original form and was thrown off the fighting stage while coughing out blood.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>With a cultivation base one level lower, he actually defeated a prodigy who had awakened a second level divine bloodline. This was too terrifying.</p><p>“50% divine beast bloodline!”</p><p>Di Feng’s eyes flashed as he announced a shocking result.</p><p>Countless people gasped.</p><p>This aokun actually had 50% God beast bloodline, that was too terrifying.</p><p>This meant that half of aokun’s blood was no different from that of a God beast.</p><p>If a human martial artist could not awaken a fifth-level divine bloodline, they would not be able to fight against someone of the same level. Even if they were one level higher, they would have to at least awaken a fourth-level divine bloodline.</p><p>Furthermore, there were strong and weak divine beasts. Aokun was obviously a flood Dragon. His bloodline was inherited from a true dragon, so he must be even more terrifying. His body was invincible and his strength was boundless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
