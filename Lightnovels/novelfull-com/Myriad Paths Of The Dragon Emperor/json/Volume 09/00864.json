Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>The next moment, the surroundings changed. He was still in the fork. His figure retreated and hit the wall behind him. His back was drenched in cold sweat and he panted heavily.</p><p>“What a powerful formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He did not dare to look at the array diagram.</p><p>“Tianyun, are you alright? Why did you go and look at that diagram array? it was carved by a Supreme martial artist after imitating a rank 9 diagram array. Only a rank 8 Alchemist can look at it!”</p><p>At the fork in the road, Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming with worry.</p><p>“Ah? Why isn’t there any hint from the grade-9 diagram?”</p><p>Lu Ming was depressed. With his current cultivation, he would be looking for trouble if he looked at the level-nine diagram array. It was already good that he wasn’t injured.</p><p>“Isn’t it written here!”</p><p>Bai chixue pointed at a Jade plate on the side of the road, which said,’only level-eight alchemists are allowed’.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He was too focused just now and did not notice it.</p><p>this is really a good place. If I have time later, I can come here and properly comprehend it!</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the fork and smiled.</p><p>The two of them walked around for a while and then left, planning to go to other places.</p><p>However, just as he walked out of the myriad formations cave, he was blocked by a few people.</p><p>The leader of the three youths was a youth with an aquiline nose. His eyes flashed with a sharp light from time to time.</p><p>“Xushan, what are you doing? Make way for me. ”</p><p>Seeing this young man, Bai chixue’s face darkened and she shouted.</p><p>“Bai chixue, what are you shouting for? What right do you have to berate me? Hmph, you’re really a b * tch. To think that my big brother is still pursuing you, but you’re hiding a wild man in Yun Peak House.”</p><p>Xu Shan sneered and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the past few days, the news of a young man moving into Yun peak had spread and caused a huge commotion among the younger generation of disciples.</p><p>Bai chixue was the youngest disciple of the talisman sect’s master, Bai Shijin. She had a noble status and was a beauty. In the talisman sect, there were many geniuses and prides who pursued her, but none of them could catch her eye.</p><p>Even those on the list of top 1000 talents were not worthy of her attention.</p><p>But now, a young man was living in the cloud Peak House, which was regarded as a Holy Land in the eyes of many male disciples. How could this not be shocking?</p><p>Countless people were eager to find trouble with Lu Ming. Xu Shan did not expect to meet Bai chixue here and stopped the two of them.</p><p>“Xushan, you … What did you just say?”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face turned red with anger and she glared at Xu Shan.</p><p>“Am I wrong?” Xu Shan snorted coldly. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, are you the one who lives in Yun Peak House?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>kid, I advise you to get out of Cloud Peak House as soon as possible. Otherwise, you might have your legs broken one day!</p><p>Xu Shan sneered, a hint of jealousy flashing through his eyes.</p><p>This kid, who knows where he came from, but he can actually live in Cloud Peak House.</p><p>Cloud Peak House not only had the eyes of inscription, but it was also a holy place for cultivating the spiritual fire. At the same time, a beauty like Bai chixue lived there. How could people not be jealous?</p><p>I advise you to watch your mouth. Otherwise, you might be slapped in the face one day!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and replied.</p><p>At the side, Bai chixue burst into laughter. Lu Ming was using Xu Shan’s words to hit back at him.</p><p>These words made Xu Shan’s face turn gloomy, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>kid, I don’t know when I’ll be slapped until my face is swollen, but today, you’ll have your legs broken!</p><p>Xu Shan said coldly. With a wave of his hand, a huge black bear appeared on the ground.</p><p>This wasn’t a real black bear, but a puppet. Its eyes emitted a cold light, and the moment it appeared, it let out a shocking roar.</p><p>This was a puppet that was equivalent to the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>At this moment, there were other people who heard the commotion and came over.</p><p>“Eh? That’s Xushan and Bai chixue!”</p><p>I heard that a strange man has been living in the cloud Peak House recently. Could it be that young man, Xu Shan’s big brother? he has been pursuing Bai chixue. No wonder Xu Shan is looking for trouble with that man. This is going to be a good show!</p><p>I don’t know where that young man came from. He’s actually able to stay in Cloud Peak Residence. He’s going to be abused sooner or later!</p><p>“It must be Bai chixue’s request. Otherwise, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to live there. This young man doesn’t know his place. If I were him, I would move out even if I had the chance. I don’t know how many people I would offend if I did that.”</p><p>In the surroundings, some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>“Xushan, what are you doing? If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>Bai chixue took a step forward and stood in front of Lu Ming, glaring at Xu Shan.</p><p>“Bai chixue, it seems that this man is really your little lover. You are so protective of him!”</p><p>Xushan sneered.</p><p>nonsense! Bai chixue blushed and said, ” I am just friends with tianyun!</p><p>“Friend? Hehe!”</p><p>Xu Shan sneered, looked at Lu Ming and shouted, brat, what kind of man are you to hide behind a woman? fight me if you have the guts!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black bear puppet roared, exuding a violent aura.</p><p>“Since you’re asking for it, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward, passing Bai chixue.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll break your legs!”</p><p>Xu Shan’s face revealed a malevolent expression, and the space between his brows lit up. The black bear puppet roared in anger and stomped on the ground. With a loud boom, it pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palm landed on the black bear puppet’s body and sent it flying a thousand meters away. It crashed heavily on the ground and became a pile of scrap metal.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>A puppet equivalent to the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, made entirely of metal and impervious to swords and Spears, was now turned into scrap metal by Lu Ming with a single slap. It was shocking.</p><p>“Martial arts, how is your martial arts so strong?”</p><p>Xu Shan reacted and shouted angrily.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect mainly cultivated the Dao of inscription. They also cultivated the Dao of martial arts, but they were only auxiliary and did not have too deep of a realm.</p><p>It was rare to see Lu Ming’s martial arts so powerful in the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Of course, there were also some geniuses in the talisman Amulet sect who were born to cultivate martial arts. However, they were very rare. In fact, they would be looked down upon by others if they cultivated martial arts.</p><p>“You’re looking for a beating!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward.</p><p>what kind of skill is it to use martial arts to destroy one of my puppets? if you have the ability, fight me with the Dao of inscription!</p><p>Xu Shan roared angrily and retreated continuously. With a wave of his hand, three puppets appeared on the ground, all at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Using the Dao of inscription, that’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and an inscription scroll appeared. He opened it and injected his mental energy fire. The inscription scroll glowed and nine combat swords floated out.</p><p>“Argh, Lv 6 Lv 9 inscription Rune Scroll, 9 extremes sword formation rune, you’re cheating, you’re cheating!”</p><p>Xu Shan shouted.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine combat swords danced in the air, cutting the three puppets into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside Xu Shan. He slapped him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
