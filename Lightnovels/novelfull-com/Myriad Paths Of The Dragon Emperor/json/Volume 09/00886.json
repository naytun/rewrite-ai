It pounced toward H Ming’s sword and the flame flood Dragon, clashing with each other.</p><p>For a time, the rumbling sounds continued, and the fighting ring was filled with a white mist.</p><p>The array that Lu Ming inscribed was all about water.</p><p>The attacks they launched were all related to water.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his feet and waved his fingers. On the fighting ring, formations emerged one after another. There were water swords, water Spears, flood Dragons, and tigers formed from water. They pounced at H Ming.</p><p>H Ming was also continuously inscribing formations, and at the same time, he was using the talismans to launch powerful attacks.</p><p>Of course, H Myng only shot out blazing flames.</p><p>It was a battle between water and fire.</p><p>“This tianyun has learned a lot of things. The formation he inscribed earlier clearly doesn’t have anything to do with water. There are other elements.”</p><p>that’s right. This tianyun is truly astonishing. He’s an unparalleled prodigy, and not only is his martial Dao powerful, but his Dao of inscription is also astonishing. We’ve all underestimated him!</p><p>that’s right. With his talent, he’s qualified to be a zongzi candidate.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad!”</p><p>An inscriber was actually the same as a warrior. They also had a preference. The inscriptions and formations they mastered were also biased towards a certain type.</p><p>For example, H might was more inclined to fire, so the formations he carved were all fire-type.</p><p>Some people were more inclined to water, ice, lightning, and so on.</p><p>Furthermore, formations were like martial arts techniques. Many of them were privately passed down, and not everyone could cultivate them. They were like secret skills.</p><p>The mental energy fire was like a warrior’s true essence, while the formation was like a martial technique.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the puppets he had obtained from Feng tai. With a wave of his hand, twelve puppets roared and charged at H Ming. As he controlled the puppets, Lu Ming also inscribed the formation.</p><p>Many people were stunned. Lu Ming was controlling twelve puppets at the same time and could still inscribe formations continuously without slowing down. This was a little terrifying. How strong was Lu Ming’s mental energy?</p><p>H Ming’s eyes turned serious. With a wave of his hand, another stack of inscription scrolls appeared in front of him. His mental energy fire spread out and continuously activated the inscription scrolls. Attacks were launched at Lu Ming and the puppets.</p><p>Moreover, H Ming’s inscription scrolls were all at Lv 6 and lv 10, which were very powerful.</p><p>amazing, both of them are so amazing! Tianyun and H Ming’s strength is already on par with Yan Tonghua and Meng Jia!</p><p>that’s right. Any one of them has the strength to enter the top three!</p><p>Even many of the older generation nodded in shock.</p><p>Below the stage, Ji mai, Yan Tong Hua, and Meng Jia all had a serious look in their eyes.</p><p>“If water doesn’t work, then add ice!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He waved his fingers and an array appeared. The temperature dropped rapidly. Countless ice swords appeared and shot toward H Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands moved faster and faster. More and more arrays appeared on the fighting ring and there were more and more attacks.</p><p>The dense ice swords had already begun to suppress H Ming’s attacks. With the addition of the twelve puppets, H Ming was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Fast, it’s too fast. How can the speed of the Tian Yun inscription formation be so terrifying? Far beyond H Ming!”</p><p>“Cultivation level, tianyun’s cultivation level is higher than H Ming’s. Tianyun has at least reached the middle stage of ‘heart’s limit’,”</p><p>that’s terrifying. He’s only a rank 6 Alchemist, but he’s already in the middle stage of ‘heart limit’. That’s amazing!</p><p>Everyone was amazed.</p><p>At this moment, the fighting ring was filled with white light and a cold air that seemed to be able to freeze the air.h Ming had no power to fight back.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>H Ming suddenly shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands moved and he waved again. The array on the fighting ring disappeared.</p><p>H Ming gasped for breath, the mental energy flame between his brows throbbing as he felt waves of fatigue.</p><p>He had exhausted his mental energy in the battle just now, and he could no longer continue fighting.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was calm and composed. It was as if the huge battle just now did not consume much of his energy.</p><p>sky cloud zongzi’s strength and spirit are both impressive.h Ming is impressed!</p><p>H Ming smiled and cupped his hands.</p><p>“You’re also very strong. I won by luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>this battle, tianyun wins. Next battle, Yan Tong versus Zhang Xin!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Everyone perked up and watched the next match.</p><p>Yan Tongtong was a heaven’s favorite from the puppet sect, and Zhang Xin was also a heaven’s favorite from the puppet sect.</p><p>Both of them were very strong, and the battle was very intense.</p><p>In the fighting ring, a large group of puppets were fighting each other. However, in the end, Yan Tongtong’s psyche was stronger, and his psyche fire was also stronger. He controlled more puppets and defeated Zhang Xin.</p><p>Then, it was Meng Jia’s turn.</p><p>Meng Jia was also a chosen of the puppet sect, and had won by controlling the puppet army.</p><p>Just like that, the top three were born. They were Lu Ming, Yan Tongtong, and Meng Jia. With Ji mai, they were the strongest four.</p><p>The four people sized each other up. They only needed to eliminate one more person and they would be able to obtain a spot on the observatory.</p><p>the four of you will take turns to fight and be ranked according to your battle results!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Usually, the specific ranking would be arranged in this way. It was the fairest way.</p><p>In this case, each person would have to fight three rounds, one against each of the other three.</p><p>the first battle, tianyun versus Yan. Next, Ji mai versus Meng Jia!</p><p>Meng Chong announced.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere of the scene was completely ignited.</p><p>The final showdown was finally about to begin.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yan huanhua went on stage at the same time and stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Who do you guys think will win if tianyun and Yan become one?”</p><p>I’m guessing it’s tianyun. Tianyun has a formation that can suppress the puppets. At the same time, tianyun is extremely powerful himself. The fact that he was able to defeat H Ming is enough to explain everything!</p><p>I think so too. Among the four of them, only Ji mai can fight against tianyun. Yan Tongtong and Meng Jia might be weaker than him!</p><p>The people around them started to discuss. However, no one dared to underestimate Lu Ming anymore.</p><p>Since the start of the competition, Lu Ming had already proven himself.</p><p>tianyun, while your formation is bizarre, it definitely has its limitations. It’s impossible for you to simply sever the connection between my opponent and the puppet and take it for your own use. It won’t be that easy for you to defeat me!</p><p>Yan Tongtong said. His eyes were filled with strong fighting spirit. Obviously, a genius like him would not admit defeat so easily.</p><p>“We’ll know after the battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s fight!”</p><p>Yan Tongtong waved his hand, and 15 puppets appeared in front of him. Each of them exuded a powerful aura, and they were all at Class 10 lv 6.</p><p>Yan Tong was able to control 15 Class 10 lv 6 puppets at the same time, which was terrifying.</p><p>Fifteen sixth-level tenth-grade puppets pounced on Lu Ming at the same time. The fighting ring rumbled and the momentum was shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
