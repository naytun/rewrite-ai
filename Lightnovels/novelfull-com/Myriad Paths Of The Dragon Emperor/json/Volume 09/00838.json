Be it demons, gods, ghosts, or demons, suppress them all!</p><p>...</p><p>A deafening sound came from the prison-suppressing stele. The stele expanded to 10000 meters in size and pressed down on Xie Zhen.</p><p>The Golden-armored burly man that Xie Zhen had transformed into roared angrily and punched out with both fists.</p><p>But in the next moment, his eyes revealed a look of fear.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele crushed the fist radiance and smashed toward the head of the burly man in golden armor.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>The burly man in golden armor roared. He tilted his head and dodged the attack. He used his shoulders to block the prison-suppressing stele and supported it with his hands.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele could suppress everything. It was like an ancient divine mountain, containing infinite weight. How could the burly man in golden armor withstand it?</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice came from the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly man in golden armor couldn’t withstand it at all. His body fell and stepped out of the fighting stage. Then, his body trembled and he knelt down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The burly man in golden armor let out an extremely furious roar.</p><p>He, the Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent, was actually suppressed by Lu Ming in public and knelt on the battle stage. It was a disgrace, a great humiliation.</p><p>“I want you to die, I want you to die!”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>As Lu Ming’s voice rang out, the prison-suppressing stele glowed and trembled slightly. The burly man in golden armor let out a furious roar and immediately lay down. His body shrank rapidly and turned into Xie Zhen’s appearance. He looked at the prison-suppressing stele above his head in fear and anger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed down on Xie Zhen.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out, rumbling in the heavens and earth.</p><p>It was the old man who was standing with black wind venerable. He snorted coldly and extended a thin palm, pointing out a finger.</p><p>A huge finger, as long as 10000 meters, appeared out of thin air and pointed at the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt an unbelievably powerful force engulfing him. In the face of this force, he had no way to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The finger touched the prison-suppressing stele. In an instant, the prison-suppressing stele exploded and turned back into Lu Ming’s figure. He flew out like a cannonball and flew ten miles away before hitting the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground exploded, and a huge pit appeared. Lu Ming lay in it, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. He felt that all his bones and bones were almost broken, and he was in excruciating pain.</p><p>That old man was too strong, unrivaled, and unfathomable. It was very likely that he was also a spiritual God Realm master like black wind Knight.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing cried out and rushed towards Lu Ming. In an instant, he was ten miles away and appeared beside Lu Ming. He helped Lu Ming up as tears fell from his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing supported Lu Ming as his essential core continued to flow into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood. He smiled and said,”Silly girl, why are you crying? I’m fine!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, fatty and the others also rushed over.</p><p>damn it, a venerable actually attacked you. At most, I’ll call my old man over and slap him to death!</p><p>Fatty roared.</p><p>“Fatty, don’t get involved in this. Leave this place quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The other party was too strong. With a Supreme realm expert, their current cultivation level was no different from ants in the eyes of a Supreme realm expert.</p><p>If they resisted, they would all die. Lu Ming did not want to implicate fatty and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll go back with them. You should recuperate and stop fighting!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s tears continued to fall.</p><p>“No, little Qing. I can feel that if you go back, you’ll definitely suffer. Even if I have to risk my life, I don’t want you to go back and suffer!”</p><p>Lu Ming struggled, wanting to get up.</p><p>Xie Zhen and the others didn’t treat Xie nianqing like a family member. They treated him like an enemy or even a servant.</p><p>Even a few servants dared to berate Xie nianqing. It was obvious that Xie nianqing’s days when he returned would not be good.</p><p>If it was a normal family member, Lu Ming would not stop them. However, in such a situation, it was obviously not the case.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not know the inside story, Xie nianqing’s ‘I’d rather die than return’ was enough to explain everything.</p><p>He would rather die than return. In Xie nianqing’s heart, returning was worse than death.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The old man took a step forward and appeared above Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all! I want them all dead!”</p><p>Xie Zhen shouted hysterically.</p><p>He was the Prince of the ancient sacred dynasty in the East continent. He was high and mighty, but he was suppressed by Lu Ming and knelt down on the spot. How humiliating was that? he was furious.</p><p>The old man frowned and looked at Xie nianqing. “Princess sixteen, please come back with me. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless!”</p><p>As a spiritual God Realm supremacy, it was embarrassing for the elder to attack a few juniors. Therefore, he did not use much strength when he attacked Lu Ming just now. He only stopped Lu Ming from killing Xie Zhen.</p><p>If he had used some of his strength, Lu Ming would have died even if he had ten lives.</p><p>The difference between the spiritual ocean realm and the spiritual God Realm was too great.</p><p>“Alright, Guardian. I’ll go back with you, but you have to let Lu Ming and the rest go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“No, that bastard must die!”</p><p>Xie Zhen glared at Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>“If you want to kill him, I’d rather die than return. At most, you can bring my corpse back!”</p><p>With a flick of his hand, a short sword appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand. He pressed it against his chest with a determined look on his face.</p><p>“Little Qing, don’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and shouted.</p><p>“Miss nianqing!”</p><p>Fatty and the others were also shocked.</p><p>“B * tch, you dare to threaten me!”</p><p>Xie Zhen roared.</p><p>That protector frowned even more.</p><p>“No matter what? I’m also Xie Qitian’s daughter. If you bring my corpse back, I believe Xie Qitian will not be happy!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were firm as he looked at the old man and Xie Zhen in the air.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s expression froze.</p><p>Among the princes, he was not the most outstanding one. If he really brought Xie nianqing’s body back, his position in his father’s heart would be affected. Even if it was just a little, it was a big deal for him.</p><p>The venerable Guardian pondered for a moment, then said, alright, I promise you. It doesn’t matter if I kill these people or not!</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing turned to look at Xie Zhen.</p><p>Xie Zhen gritted his teeth and finally said, ” alright, I agree as well. I’ll let that piece of trash off. However, you have to agree to seal your cultivation and obediently return with us!</p><p>“Alright, I’ll do as I say!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with reluctance.</p><p>“Silly, I’m leaving!” Xie nianqing smiled slightly, with a trace of sadness, as beautiful as a summer flower.</p><p>“Little Qing …”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed softly, his fists clenched tightly.</p><p>In the end, he still couldn’t make Xie nianqing stay. He still needed Xie nianqing to save his life.</p><p>At this moment, he hated himself. He hated himself for being powerless. He hated himself for not being strong enough.</p><p>If he had the power to rule the world, how could Xie Zhen and the others take Xie nianqing away?</p><p>Why would he let her do something that Xie nianqing didn’t want to do?</p><p>However, he was still too weak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
