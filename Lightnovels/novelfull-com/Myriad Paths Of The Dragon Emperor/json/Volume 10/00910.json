However, his punch did not break the stone door. This stone door was frighteningly hard.</p><p>...</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming directly exploded his dragon power.</p><p>Scales appeared on his body and his muscles bulged. He was filled with explosive power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A heavy punch landed on the stone door, causing it to shake violently. The two mountains beside the stone door also shook violently, but in the end, the stone door remained intact.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a ferocious beast in human form. He punched the stone door several times in a row, but he still could not break it open.</p><p>“It’s too hard. With my cultivation level, there’s still a gap. I can’t break it!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>hahaha, the heavens are really helping me. I’d better wait for my death outside!</p><p>Seeing this, Wang Yan laughed arrogantly.</p><p>Jiang Taichong also revealed a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He turned around and stopped attacking the stone door. Instead, he started to inscribe an array on the empty space.</p><p>“Hmph, you want to inscribe a formation to protect yourself? dream on!”</p><p>Wang Yan sneered.</p><p>Since they had seen it, they would definitely be more careful in the future. They would not enter Lu Ming’s array easily.</p><p>Lu Ming spent three hours setting up a large array. He then stopped.</p><p>Indeed, Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong had both seen him inscribing a formation here. No matter how powerful the formation he had inscribed was, Wang Chong and Jiang Taixu would not be fooled into walking in.</p><p>Therefore, the array that he had just carved was not a powerful killing array at all. Instead, it was an array that assisted in the cultivation of mental fire.</p><p>The only way out now was strength. As long as he had enough strength, he would not need to fear Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong.</p><p>Therefore, he could only break through on his own!</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current martial arts cultivation was only at the peak ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm. There was still the perfected spiritual ocean realm above him. He would only be able to break through to the spirit embryo realm if he went further.</p><p>It was almost impossible to break through in a short time.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that the array at Double Moon Mountain could only hold Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong back for five days at most.</p><p>It was almost impossible to break through to the spirit embryo realm in five days.</p><p>Now, only the Dao of inscription could make it possible.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming had already lit up ten Blue Spirit lamps. He was only one step away from becoming a seventh-level Alchemist.</p><p>As long as his inscription Dao reached Level Seven, Lu Ming’s strength would increase greatly. By then, he would be able to contend or even kill Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong with his inscription Dao.</p><p>Originally, it wasn’t the time for a breakthrough yet. It wasn’t perfect yet and needed to cultivate for a period of time before it could naturally break through.</p><p>However, he could not care so much now. Lu Ming had to use some means and strive to break through within five days.</p><p>He sat down cross-legged and took out a pill.</p><p>Lu Ming had bought the spirit enrage pill from the talisman Amulet sect’s treasure Pavilion. Consuming this pill would cause one’s mental energy fire to go berserk. It could increase one’s mental energy fire for a short period of time and, from there, achieve the effect of breaking through to the next realm.</p><p>However, there was a risk here. If he failed to break through to the next realm, it might cause a few of his mental lamps to go out, and it would be very difficult to cultivate back later.</p><p>Even if he succeeded in breaking through, his Foundation would still be unstable, which would affect his future cultivation. He would need to spend time to make up for it.</p><p>But now, he couldn’t care so much. He had to get through the difficulties in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming had to break through to the next realm within five days.</p><p>Lu Ming swallowed the violent spirit pill without hesitation. He then activated the meditation and started cultivating.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, his mental energy fire started to go berserk and burned even more vigorously. On the ground, the array glowed. This kind of array could also allow the mental energy fire to erupt with even more power.</p><p>Time passed quickly. One day, two days …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four days had passed. In Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the mental energy fire was already abnormally violent and was about to turn into an angry dragon.</p><p>As the mind fire went on a rampage, the flames of the ten mind lamps began to merge and condense into a ball that burned fiercely.</p><p>Now, he had to make the blue mental fire turn purple.</p><p>Once it turned purple, it meant that he had broken through to become a seventh-rank Alchemist.</p><p>Time flew by quickly, minute by minute.</p><p>Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong continued to bombard those formations, but they were broken one by one. They were about to break through the formation and enter.</p><p>this kid knows that he can’t escape and is waiting for death!</p><p>Wang Yan sneered.</p><p>“Be careful later. This brat might counterattack before he dies!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong said.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? No matter how he counterattacks, he’s still a spiritual ocean tier martial artist, so what threat can he be to us?”</p><p>Wang Yan sneered.</p><p>Jiang Taichong also nodded. It was indeed so.</p><p>They were all geniuses among geniuses. It was common for them to jump levels and kill others. Moreover, they were now in a higher realm than Lu Ming. No one could defeat them when they were in a higher realm.</p><p>They were constantly bombarding the array. Lu Ming had also reached a critical point in his cultivation.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the mental energy fire continued to condense and shrink. Slowly, when it had shrunk to its limit, a wisp of purple light spread out.</p><p>A small purple Spirit Fire was burning slowly on the first spirit lamp. It looked small and was not burning hot, but the spirit power that it emitted was ten times stronger than before.</p><p>the purple mind fire has finally broken through!</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>He now felt that as long as he willed it, a vast amount of spiritual power would be released.</p><p>it seems that they haven’t broken through the array. Let’s wait for them!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He closed his eyes and activated the meditation to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>After half a day, there was a loud boom. Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong finally broke through the formation and stood dozens of meters away from Lu Ming. However, they did not immediately pounce on Lu Ming because they had seen him inscribe a large formation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and slowly got up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your time of death has arrived!”</p><p>Wang Yan revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>“Oh, really? If you have the ability, come and kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a contemptuous smile.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think that you can be safe just because you inscribed a formation? I’ll break it!”</p><p>Wang Yan took a step forward and a stream of flames surged towards Lu Ming along the ground.</p><p>The flames passed through without any obstruction. Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he avoided the flame.</p><p>Wang Yan was slightly taken aback, but he immediately burst out laughing.”So you’re just trying to be mysterious. You don’t even have a formation. Die!”</p><p>With that, Wang Yan’s figure flickered as he pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>Jiang Taichong did not move. Instead, he guarded the surroundings to prevent any changes or to prevent Lu Ming from escaping.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as Lu Ming burst forth with his dragon energy and threw a punch at Wang Yan.</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming was sent flying backward. He spat out a mouthful of blood and stomped on the ground.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed out loud as the terrifying flames surged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed to one side, looking like he wanted to escape. However, Jiang Taichong moved and blocked Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
