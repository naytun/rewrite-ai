Each of them contributed more than 100000 fate points. In addition to the others and the previous ones, Lu Ming had 800000 fate points.</p><p>However, di Shen, Luo Tian, Wang fentian, and the others did not know that. They believed that the last totem pillar would definitely reward Lu Ming with a huge amount of luck value, which was why Lu Ming had such a huge amount of luck value.</p><p>The others in the surroundings came to a sudden realization.</p><p>I see. I was wondering how Lu Ming, this little b * stard, could have obtained so much luck. It turns out that he took advantage of the situation and used despicable means to obtain it!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan sneered.</p><p>“What’s the use of getting it like this? He won’t be able to hold on to it in the battle of karmic luck. Countless people will be watching him, and his karmic luck will still be stolen!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Jiang family sneered.</p><p>As expected, many pairs of eyes on the fighting ring were staring at Lu Ming with a burning desire.</p><p>The top 10,20, and even 30 on the list of top 1000 talents, as well as the newly-risen talents and the talents of the heavenly demon Valley, were all looking at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming was a big piece of fat meat that everyone could not wait to take a bite of.</p><p>800,000 points of luck. As long as he defeated or even killed Lu Ming, how many points of luck would he get?</p><p>Their hearts were beating fast.</p><p>The divine Emperor, ao tu, and the others also had a lot of luck, but none of them dared to have any ideas.</p><p>Wasn’t it courting death to have designs on the Emperor God and the others?</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only obtained so much luck value by relying on luck and treasures. If that was not a fat piece of meat, what was it?</p><p>Only a few of them had serious looks on their faces.</p><p>For example, brother Litian and Nangong Bo.</p><p>They had all fought with Lu Ming before and knew how powerful he was.</p><p>This was especially true for Nangong Bo. Even he was defeated by Lu Ming. After that, it had been nearly half a year. Lu Ming must have become stronger. This piece of fat meat might not be delicious.</p><p>However, he did not spread the news that Nangong Bo had lost to Lu Ming back then. Almost no one knew about it.</p><p>Therefore, only a few people knew about Lu Ming’s combat strength, except for those from the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Many people from the talisman sect sneered.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ming’s powerful combat strength. He had easily killed a few of the bloodblade continent’s geniuses who were comparable to the top 10 on the list of top 1000 talents. Lu Ming was not a piece of fat meat, but a knife that could kill.</p><p>She wondered what kind of expressions they would have when they saw Lu Ming’s combat ability later on?</p><p>Many talisman sect disciples revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>However, they still had some worries.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, he would be in great danger if he were to fight against di Shen, ao tu, and Xue Jian Yi.</p><p>After Lu Ming stepped on it, there was no one else behind him.</p><p>The people who were qualified to participate in the battle for Providence had also come out.</p><p>There were about 1000 people who could turn into pythons.</p><p>There were about 300 people who had the fate to turn into flood Dragons.</p><p>There were only about sixty people whose fate had transformed into a Dragon.</p><p>The 60 people included the sovereigns of the sky demon Valley and the newly rising ones. Therefore, only the top 30 or so on the list of top 1000 talents could reach this level.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions.</p><p>Some of the lower-ranked ones managed to reach it, while some of the top 30 didn’t.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the fighting ring shook slightly and glowed.</p><p>the battle platform is about to turn into a battlefield. Let’s go to the stands first!</p><p>Someone shouted and flew towards the surrounding stands.</p><p>The paragons on the fighting ring flashed and flew to the other fighting rings, landing in their respective areas.</p><p>In an instant, there was not a single person left on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The fighting ring glowed, and suddenly eight bubble-like semi-circular light shields emerged, dividing the entire fighting ring into eight parts.</p><p>Within the light barrier, mountains and rivers slowly appeared, as if it was evolving into a world.</p><p>This was something that everyone was already clear about.</p><p>In a moment, the fighting ring would be divided into eight different areas, forming eight battlefields.</p><p>All the young men who had the luck of turning into a Python or above would be automatically divided into eight groups and enter eight battlefields to compete.</p><p>As long as one defeated their opponent, they would be able to obtain 50% of the opponent’s fate. The defeated person would be eliminated and teleported out. In the end, they would be able to retain 50% of their fate.</p><p>And once they killed their opponent, they would be able to obtain all of the other party’s luck.</p><p>However, the opponent could also admit defeat, but once he admitted defeat, he would lose 90% of his fate, and only 10% could be kept.</p><p>It could be said that those who were weak were destined to have their luck stolen by those who were stronger.</p><p>But it wasn’t completely without life.</p><p>The battle for Providence would last for an hour. As long as one could last for an hour, they would be able to keep all of their Providence after the battle for Providence ended.</p><p>In the end, only the person with the strongest fate energy in each battlefield could advance.</p><p>In the final eight battlefields, the eight people with the strongest fate would fight for the other side’s fate.</p><p>That was why so many people were staring at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was a piece of fat meat.</p><p>Everyone watched quietly. It would take some time for the battlefield to evolve.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming quietly came to Bai Shijin’s side.</p><p>“Senior white, this junior has a matter that I would like to ask for your help with!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Bai Shijin.</p><p>“What is it? Just say it!”</p><p>Bai Shijin also sent a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>in the battle of Providence, I obtained a treasure called the mountain and river diagram … the elder said.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Bai Shijin. After he finished speaking, the mountain and river painting scroll appeared in his hands and he handed it to Bai Shijin.</p><p>“There’s actually such a wonderful treasure. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely do it for you. It won’t take much time!” He said.</p><p>Bai Shijin took the mountain and river diagram and retreated silently. Then, in a flash, he disappeared into the teleportation vortex and left this place without anyone noticing.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s attention was on the fighting ring below.</p><p>Time slowly passed. A few minutes later, the area covered by the eight light shields was completed, forming eight worlds.</p><p>Eight different worlds.</p><p>There were mountains and forests, deserts, rocks, swamps …</p><p>Each of the eight light shields had a diameter of about ten miles. Therefore, from the outside, the mountains and forests were very small, as if they were mini.</p><p>However, many people knew that this was a battlefield that spanned a hundred thousand li.</p><p>Each battlefield was a hundred thousand miles wide.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The light barrier glowed as the battlefield was completed. On the light barrier of each battlefield, a number appeared.</p><p>They were one, two, three …</p><p>All the way up to eight, representing eight battlefields.</p><p>At that moment, beams of light shot out from the eight battlefields and landed on the young people who were going to participate in the battle for Providence.</p><p>Then, a number appeared above everyone’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
