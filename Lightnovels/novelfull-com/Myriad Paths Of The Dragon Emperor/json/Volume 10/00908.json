It’s very likely that there are treasures or opportunities inside!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the map for a while and kept it.</p><p>“Let’s go to the divine bird cliff and take a look first!”</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a place and flew towards the divine bird cliff according to the marks on the map.</p><p>The journey of tens of thousands of miles was soon completed.</p><p>In front of them was a huge cliff that reached into the clouds. They could see it from far away. It was the divine bird cliff.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to fly over when two powerful auras burst out from the divine bird cliff.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, a figure rushed into the sky, his corpse Qi billowing.</p><p>corpse puppet, he has broken through to the spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He immediately restrained his aura and landed in the forest below to watch from a distance.</p><p>At this moment, the corpse puppet’s face carried a trace of fear and appeared to be in a sorry state.</p><p>“Corpse puppet, die!”</p><p>A domineering voice was heard, and demonic Qi soared into the sky. A young man in a black robe appeared and blocked in front of the corpse puppet.</p><p>This youth’s eyes were cold and his demonic Qi was monstrous. His aura was much stronger than a corpse puppet that had reached the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Luo Li, don’t you go too far!”</p><p>The corpse puppet roared.</p><p>“Luo Li, little demon Lord Luo Li!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he looked solemn.</p><p>There were two Supreme geniuses among the Imperial Guards of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and they were blood Brothers.</p><p>Demon Lord Luo Tian, little demon Lord Luo Li, and Demon Lord Luo Tian. Their talents were monstrous and extremely terrifying. They were ranked tenth on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>As for the little demon Lord, Luo Li, he was not as talented, but he was still very terrifying. He was ranked 61st on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. Weaklings can only say such words. So what if I’m bullying you? Today, you will die. The luck value on your body belongs to me!”</p><p>hahahaha! Luo Li laughed as the black mist around him churned. His demonic might was extremely powerful. He took a step forward, and his demonic might completely enveloped the corpse puppet, turning it into a demonic territory.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The corpse puppet didn’t dare to fight back. Its corpse Qi burst out and formed a sword light, trying to break through the demonic power and escape.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Luo Li shouted coldly as a black light burst out. The stunning blade light seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth apart. It was unparalleled and unstoppable.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The corpse puppet couldn’t even block a single blade. Its head was chopped off, and its corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>However, the ancient coffin on the corpse puppet’s back trembled and flew into the distance at an extreme speed.</p><p>“The human-corpse transformation technique is useless in front of me!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Luo Li’s mouth. A blade light cut through the void and struck the ancient coffin.</p><p>The ancient coffin exploded, and a skinny figure emerged from it. He was panicking and fleeing for his life.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This was the true body of the corpse puppet. The one before was just his refined corpse.</p><p>However, the refined corpse was actually no different from a human. It could open its mouth and communicate with people, which was really amazing.</p><p>A Saber Light slashed at the corpse puppet again.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The corpse puppet roared, and in the next moment, it was directly cut in half by the saber Light.</p><p>The corpse puppet, ranked 96th on the list of top 1000 talents, had been killed just like that. It was clear how brutal the Battle of Destiny was. This was only the beginning, and it would only get more brutal as time went on. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call it the burial ground of the top talents.</p><p>After Luo Li killed the corpse puppet, he waved his hand and kept the storage ring. Then, he looked in Lu Ming’s direction with his demonic eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. Could it be that he was discovered by Luo Li despite being so far away?</p><p>However, ro li only took a glance and sneered. He then shifted his gaze and descended toward the divine bird cliff.</p><p>“It seems like we can’t go to the divine bird cliff!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Ro Li’s cultivation base was too strong. Compared to him, he was far behind, so he could only avoid him.</p><p>He turned around quietly and headed in the direction of the double Moon Mountain.</p><p>Not long after, they were only a few thousand miles away from the double Moon Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and slowly approached. Who knew if there were any powerful geniuses on the double Moon Mountain? Lu Ming had to be more careful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a purple flame shot up into the sky from below and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He took a step back and retreated rapidly, avoiding the attack.</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wang Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He realized that the aura on Wang Yan’s body was extremely terrifying. It was not the aura of the spiritual ocean tier, but the spirit embryo tier.</p><p>Wang Yan had also broken through to the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>For a genius like Wang Yan to break through from the spiritual ocean tier to the spirit embryo tier, it was definitely not just a little bit of improvement. His battle prowess would skyrocket.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you die this time!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s eyes were as cold as ice.</p><p>Previously, he was severely injured by Lu Ming and almost died. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>A mere piece of trash dared to seriously injure him. This was simply unforgivable.</p><p>The flames on his body were several times more terrifying than they were twenty days ago. The temperature was so high that even the space began to distort.</p><p>Even from a distance, Lu Ming could feel a sharp pain in his body, as if his entire body was on fire.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In a flash, Wang Yan crossed the void and appeared in front of Lu Ming. He threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded. Lu Ming did not hold back at all and instantly exploded with all his dragon energy. Four streams of dragon energy exploded. The vital essence in his body roared and four types of concepts swirled around. He activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A beam of fire soared into the sky and Lu Ming’s body was sent flying. Blood spurted out of his mouth and he felt a sharp pain on his arm. The Dragon scales were cracked by the flames and the surface of his arm was charred black. The fragrance of roasted meat wafted out.</p><p>Too powerful! Wang Yan’s battle prowess had increased by too much after breaking through to the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s cultivation had risen to the peak ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm during this period of time, he was still far from being Wang Yan’s match.</p><p>His breakthrough was only a small breakthrough, while Wang Yan’s was a huge breakthrough. It was incomparable.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not broken through, he would not have been able to withstand a single punch and would have been seriously injured.</p><p>“I’m not his match right now. Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. He turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the distance.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to escape. You must die today!”</p><p>die! Wang Yan roared and turned into a flash of fire, chasing after Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>However, in terms of speed, Lu Ming was still faster. The distance between the two of them was slowly widening.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Yan roared.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>In front of him, an extremely sharp ray of light pierced through the air and flew toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
