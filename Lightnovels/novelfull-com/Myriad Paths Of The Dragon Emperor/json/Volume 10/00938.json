They had not known about this beforehand. If they had not been more cautious and rushed in rashly, they would have been in danger.</p><p>...</p><p>No wonder these people were all standing by the lakeshore and didn’t go over.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest observed for a while and left the place.</p><p>Since there was still half a month before the poisonous fog dissipated, they found a place nearby to cultivate and wait for the time to pass.</p><p>Ten miles away, on a small mountain peak, four people sat cross-legged, waiting for time to pass.</p><p>Time flew by, and the days went by.</p><p>There were more and more people in this area, but most of them only took a glance and waited nearby.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three returned to the shore.</p><p>From the barren mountains around them, figures flew over.</p><p>Before long, hundreds of people had gathered here.</p><p>Those who dared to come here to fight for the opportunities were not weak. They were all experts. Of course, there were also those who wanted to try their luck.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, an extremely powerful pressure spread down, pressing on everyone’s hearts.</p><p>“Damn, who is it?”</p><p>Who are you? ” a burly young man shouted and looked up. But the next moment, his expression changed and cold sweat dripped down his face.</p><p>In the sky, a black-robed young man stood with his hands behind his back, demonic Qi soaring to the sky.</p><p>His face was sharp and cold, and his eyes were shining like two demonic blades.</p><p>“Luo Tian, the demonic Lord Luo Tian!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Luo Tian, ranked 10th on the list of top 1000 talents. Many people’s expressions changed and their hearts sank. They didn’t expect him to come.</p><p>“This is Luo Tian?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He had killed Luo Tian’s younger brother, the little demon Lord Luo Li.</p><p>it seems like Luo Tian already knows that I killed his brother!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on brother Litian, who was standing not far away from Luo Tian.</p><p>It seems like brother Li Tian didn’t die at the hands of the three eyed God race.</p><p>Since brother Litian was with Luo Tian, Luo Tian should have known that he had killed Luo Li.</p><p>However, he was currently in disguise and had concealed his aura, so he was not afraid.</p><p>“Luo … Luo Tian, I didn’t know it was you just now. I … Take back your words!”</p><p>The burly young man’s expression was extremely ugly. His eyes were filled with fear as he stuttered.</p><p>“People have to be responsible for their own words!”</p><p>Luo Tian’s eyes were cold, but his voice was calm. He waved his hand.</p><p>A pitch-black blade aura tore through the void and slashed at the burly youth.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The brawny young man turned around and fled without hesitation.</p><p>However, Luo Tian frowned slightly and waved his palm again. The power of the saber Light suddenly increased. It instantly cut through the void and slashed at the burly youth’s head.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The burly young man roared.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The blade light slashed and the stout youth was cut in half.</p><p>All the other heaven’s favorites around kept quiet.</p><p>The demonic Lord Luo Tian was famous in the eastern barren territory for his ruthless methods.</p><p>After seeing him today, it was indeed the case. The burly young man had just unintentionally said a word of ‘curse’, and he had gotten himself killed. It could be seen how overbearing he was.</p><p>Moreover, the burly young man was a genius of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Even if they were from the same sect, he had been killed by Luo Tian because of a single sentence.</p><p>hehe, Luo Tian, you’re very impressive. You can only show off your power here!</p><p>At this time, a mocking voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Who was it? He actually dared to tell Luo Tian the truth. Did he not want to live?</p><p>In the sky, a golden light flashed and a figure appeared.</p><p>It was a golden-haired young man with a Jade-like face. He was wearing a golden feather robe and was filled with a luxurious aura.</p><p>His body emitted a golden light, and in the light, a golden divine bird could be seen flying and chirping.</p><p>The Golden Luan!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized the Golden divine bird in the light.</p><p>This was a demon race heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“The Golden pool!”</p><p>Luo Tian slowly uttered a name. His eyes were solemn.</p><p>The others were also greatly shocked.</p><p>Although the demon clan of the sky demon Valley was not on the list of top 1000 talents, some of their extremely powerful talents were still eye-catching.</p><p>The Golden pool had the bloodline of the divine bird, the Golden Luan. It was said that the bloodline was at least 60% thick. It could be ranked in the top five among the heavenly demon Valley’s geniuses and was more famous than Luo Tian.</p><p>No wonder this person dared to look down on Luo Tian.</p><p>Luo Tian, with me here, don’t even think about getting the totem pole on the sky Poison Island!</p><p>Jinchi looked at Luo Tian with a cold smile.</p><p>“Not necessarily. Whoever can get it depends on ability, but it also depends on luck and opportunity!”</p><p>Luo Tian said.</p><p>“Hahaha, luck? Chance? I have the strength to crush everything, why do I need luck and opportunity? only the weak would say that?”</p><p>Jinchi laughed.</p><p>Luo Tian’s expression was ugly. If anyone else dared to speak to him like this, he would have cut them down with his saber. However, he was not confident about Jin Chi.</p><p>He felt a strong sense of danger from the Golden pool.</p><p>“The poisonous mist is starting to disperse!”</p><p>At this moment, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone looked forward and saw that the thick green Poison mist was rapidly dissipating as if a strong wind was blowing on the surface of the lake. The scene in the lake also became clear.</p><p>In the center of the lake was an extremely huge island. It was about ten thousand miles away from the shore.</p><p>That was the sky Poison Island.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden pool was the first to move. It turned into a golden light and flew toward the sky Poison Island.</p><p>After that, Luo Tian and the other heaven’s pride experts also began to move. They were all afraid of being left behind as they flew towards the sky Poison Island.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three blended into the crowd and flew together.</p><p>The journey of ten thousand miles only took a few minutes for them.</p><p>As they neared the island, many people stopped. The island was covered in dense forests, which was completely different from the outside world.</p><p>In the sky above the forest, there was a thick green mist rolling like green clouds.</p><p>However, in the forest below, there was only a faint green mist. Compared to the sky, it was many times thinner.</p><p>“I think the Golden pool has already rushed in. Although there is poisonous gas in this forest, it is far from comparable to the poisonous gas in the lake or in the sky. It should be able to resist!”</p><p>“That’s right, as long as we don’t fly into the sky, we should be fine. Let’s go!”</p><p>One by one, the figures rushed into the island and disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three gathered together and landed in the forest.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>As soon as they landed in the forest, they heard a sizzling sound. It was the green mist corroding their protective Zhen Yuan. However, it was not very strong, so they could easily block it.</p><p>The four of them followed the forest and rushed toward the depths of the island.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Not long after, they heard a shrill scream.</p><p>“There’s danger!”</p><p>The four of them looked at each other, slowed down, and focused their attention as they headed in the direction of the scream. Soon, they found a young man lying on the ground, no longer breathing.</p><p>A pitch-black poisonous Scorpion was lying on the young man’s body and biting him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
