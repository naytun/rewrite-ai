And that chick!”</p><p>Suddenly, an excited laugh was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the sound and realized that it was Luo Tian who was laughing.</p><p>Number eight also appeared above his head.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming and Bai chixue with a burning gaze.</p><p>Other than that, many other talents who had been assigned to number eight were also looking at Lu Ming and Bai chixue with burning eyes.</p><p>f * ck, Luo Tian’s luck is unbelievable. He’s actually assigned to the same battlefield as Lu Ming and that chick. These two people are clearly fat meat and are giving away their luck!</p><p>that’s right. Luo Tian is so lucky. The point is, there are no experts on the eighth battlefield. Look, the divine Emperor and the others are not on the eighth battlefield.</p><p>in the eighth battlefield, only one genius from the sky demon Valley can compete with Luo Tian. There are no other strong Masters. Luo Tian is so lucky. I’m so envious!</p><p>All the paragons in the surroundings revealed expressions of envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He glanced around and realized that di Shen was assigned number one, ao tu was number seven, Blood Sword number one and three, Wang fentian was number two …</p><p>Those who were stronger than Luo Tian were not even on the eighth battlefield.</p><p>At that moment, Luo Tian was so excited that he wanted to roar at the sky.</p><p>Luck, he was too lucky.</p><p>Not only was he assigned to the same battlefield as Lu Ming, but the more powerful paragons were not assigned to the eighth battlefield. His luck was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with a cold, murderous look and a burning greed.</p><p>Another genius of the sky demon Valley was just as excited as Luo Tian. He was also a peerless genius of the sky demon Valley. His reputation was no less than Luo Tian’s, and he was also an extremely terrifying existence.</p><p>At that moment, he was as excited as Luo Tian.</p><p>Di Shen, Xue Jian Yi, and the others snorted coldly and looked regretful that they had missed Lu Ming.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming’s luck was destined to be snatched away.</p><p>Du songjue and the rest had solemn expressions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Chi Xue, the next match will last for an hour. Try to stall for time. If the situation turns bad, admit defeat immediately, understand? You two will definitely be targeted.”</p><p>Du songjue seriously warned.</p><p>“Senior du, don’t worry. I know what to do. But Bai …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Bai chixue.</p><p>He saw Bai chixue staring at him with her eyes wide open.</p><p>“Bai … That, Chi Xue, when we enter the battlefield later, find a place to inscribe a defensive formation with all your strength. I will come to find you. If you can’t win, admit defeat as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’ll come and find me, right?”</p><p>Bai chixue stared at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“That … Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless as he touched his nose.</p><p>“Hehe, then I’ll definitely persevere until you come to find me!”</p><p>Bai chixue laughed happily.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more speechless. Around him, Yan kuangtu, du songjue, and the rest revealed an ‘I see’ expression and an inexplicable smile.</p><p>rukong, you’ll be on the same battlefield as the Emperor God. If you encounter the Emperor God, admit defeat immediately, understand? ”</p><p>Du songjue looked at ru Kong and instructed.</p><p>Ru Kong was du songjue’s disciple.</p><p>“This disciple knows!”</p><p>Ru Kong nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, there were fluctuations in the space. Lu Ming and the others felt a force pulling them over to the eight battlefields.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai chixue flew toward the light shield on the eighth battlefield.</p><p>As they neared the light shield, their bodies began to shrink in a strange manner. In the end, they entered the light shield and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in a barren mountain with stone walls.</p><p>The eighth battlefield was filled with barren mountains and stone walls. It was completely desolate without a single blade of grass or tree. There were stone walls and rocks everywhere.</p><p>I’ve heard that everything in this battlefield is extremely hard. Let’s give it a try!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at a huge rock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Only a corner of the giant rock had been broken. The rest of it was intact.</p><p>“It’s so hard. Although I didn’t use my full strength, that punch would have shattered a few mountains if it was outside. But here, it could only break a corner of a huge rock.”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>In this place, one could unleash their full combat strength.</p><p>“Let’s go find Chi Xue!”</p><p>With a single step, Lu Ming’s figure soared into the sky, turning into a ray of light and disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>Although the battlefield was 100000 miles wide, it wasn’t big for the geniuses who were participating in the battle for Providence. An hour was enough for them to make many trips.</p><p>The weakest heaven’s pride expert who could transform his fate into a Python was at Qin Qingshan’s level.</p><p>After such a long time, Qin Qingshan’s cultivation had already reached the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>It could be said that the weakest of the participants this time was at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm was extremely fast. It really didn’t take much time to cross a distance of a hundred thousand li.</p><p>Outside the battlefield, everyone was also watching with wide eyes.</p><p>From the outside, the 100000 li territory had shrunk to 10000 times smaller. If a person were to be placed inside, he would almost not be able to see them.</p><p>However, at the spiritual God Realm or even the Supreme-being realm, their eyesight was extremely terrifying. In their eyes, they could still clearly see the movements of everyone inside the light shield.</p><p>not good! There’s an expert heading towards Scarlet Snow!</p><p>An elder of the talisman sect called out worriedly.</p><p>At the moment, Bai chixue was in a Stone Forest, inscribing inscriptions and setting up formations to defend.</p><p>I hope that Chi Xue can’t hold on and quickly admit defeat!</p><p>Du songjue was a little worried.</p><p>Just now, they knew that Bai chixue had gotten the inheritance of a King. They were so excited. Bai chixue’s value in their hearts had increased. Nothing could happen to him.</p><p>Even though he had lost 90% of his luck, he could not let anything happen to Bai chixue.</p><p>Bai chixue’s cultivation of the way of inscription had improved a lot since she got the inheritance of the king. She waved her fingers and countless inscriptions went into the forest.</p><p>In just a few minutes, he had no idea how many inscriptions were engraved.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s the girl from the talisman sect. I’m so lucky!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, a Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect appeared.</p><p>A fifteen-meter-long Dragon of luck appeared above the head of this sovereign of the sky corpse sect. He stared at the hundred-meter-long Dragon of luck above Bai chixue’s head with burning eyes, as if he wanted to swallow her up.</p><p>“This Girl Is Mine!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. The sky trembled and another figure appeared.</p><p>It was a young man with cold eyes and a towering demonic Qi. Above his head, there was also a fate Dragon that was 60 feet long.</p><p>“Hmph, if you want this little girl’s luck, then you’ll have to see your ability!”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly corpse sect said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
