He spent the next two days refining the remaining five nature fruits.</p><p>...</p><p>His earth concept had improved to the middle of the third level.</p><p>however, the effects of the thousand elephant fruit are getting worse and worse!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>The effect of the thousand-form fruit was the best during the first five. The further he ate, the more his body seemed to be immune to the thousand-form fruit, and the less effective it was.</p><p>If he had more nature manifestation fruits and continued to eat them, the effect would be minimal.</p><p>All four intents had broken through to the third level. The next step was to form a spirit embryo.</p><p>Condensing a spirit embryo was to condense the spirit ocean into a round shape, like a placenta. That was why it was called a spirit embryo.</p><p>A spirit embryo could give birth to a spirit God.</p><p>It wasn’t that easy to form a spirit embryo, and it required a massive amount of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming had a large number of raw gemstones on him, but he did not want to waste them. Weren’t there many three-eyed gods out there? Why waste it?</p><p>Lu Ming came out of the cave and found a very magnificent and more obvious mountain peak.</p><p>Lu Ming began to inscribe the array on the peak of the mountain.</p><p>The endless inscriptions kept entering the mountain peak.</p><p>This time, he spent two whole days to inscribe a formation.</p><p>However, this formation was a top-notch level-seven formation, and its power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>After he was done, Lu Ming spent a little more time to inscribe some level-seven intermediate formations. Then, he sat cross-legged on the mountain peak.</p><p>He planned to wait here for the three-eyed God race.</p><p>After all, the intent realm and true essence he devoured needed time to refine and Polish. He might as well wait for the enemy to take the bait, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on the peak of the mountain, cultivating quietly with his eyes closed.</p><p>One day, two days, and the first three days, there was no one.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry. His essential core and artistic conception were slowly becoming pure. However, it was not enough. He still needed to condense and polish them rapidly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been sitting there for six days.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>On the seventh day, there was the sound of air breaking. More than 20 figures appeared not far from the mountain.</p><p>More than 20 figures were all young people.</p><p>Some of them were young heaven’s pride experts, while others carried long swords on their backs and were wrapped in black robes. They were men of sacrifice.</p><p>These were the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>“There’s someone on the mountain!”</p><p>One of them looked at the mountain peak and said.</p><p>The others all looked towards the mountain peak.</p><p>“That person looks familiar. Eh, it’s Lu Ming! That’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>it’s really Lu Ming. I didn’t expect him to be sitting on the mountain peak so openly.</p><p>“Brother Luan, why don’t we attack and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The few young men all looked at a young man in armor.</p><p>He was a God-tier genius from the Luan family, an ancient family. He was ranked 139th on the list of top 1000 talents and was the leader of the crowd.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also opened his eyes and looked at the geniuses of the Ditian divine Palace. The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Lu Ming did not disguise himself since he was going down the formation. If the paragons of the other forces wanted to kill him, he would not mind killing them and obtaining their luck points.</p><p>The Prodigy of the chaotic clan frowned.</p><p>Back then, at the ninedragons ‘exchange meet, Lu Ming had displayed his powerful combat strength and was not much weaker than him. Now that more than half a year had passed, although he had made great progress, Lu Ming must have become stronger as well. He was not confident.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was sitting on the mountain peak openly. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>“Lu Ming is very evil. To be honest, I’m not 100% sure. Besides, he’s just sitting there. I’m afraid he’s up to something. Let’s leave Lu Ming’s life to those stronger people. We just have to spread the news.”</p><p>Said the chosen of the chaotic clan.</p><p>The others were silent for a moment before nodding.</p><p>Since The Prodigy of the chaotic clan had said so, the others, who were weaker in battle prowess, naturally didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’re leaving this place!”</p><p>The chosen of the chaotic clan said. Then, the group flew forward and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. These people were really cautious.</p><p>He had no choice but to continue waiting.</p><p>However, in less than two hours, a loud sound came from the front. Lu Ming saw that it was still the young man from the Luan family and his group. However, at this moment, they were panicking and in a sorry state, running for their lives.</p><p>Behind them, tall and burly figures were chasing them.</p><p>Behind them, there were five to six hundred three-eyed gods pursuing them.</p><p>There were quite a few powerful beings among the three-eyed gods, and their auras were extremely terrifying.</p><p>die, human! How dare you use us as your trial targets? die!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! Kill! the three-eyed God race members all shouted as they madly pursued. They weren’t using their full strength, and it was as if they were playing cat and mouse.</p><p>stop playing around. Kill these ants as soon as possible and look for other humans. You’ll be heavily rewarded for every human you kill.</p><p>A deep voice rang out.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>yes! an expert from the three-eyed God race responded, and his speed suddenly increased. He soared into the air and charged in front of the chosen from the Luan clan, blocking their path.</p><p>Those people were shockingly at the third level of spirit embryo realm.</p><p>As for the youth from the Luan family, he was only at the great circle of the spiritual ocean tier. At this moment, he had a look of despair.</p><p>hey, there’s a human on that mountain. Go, kill him!</p><p>At this moment, the three-eyed God race noticed Lu Ming. The leader waved his hand, and a first level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God immediately rushed up the mountain peak and charged at Lu Ming with a sinister smile.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The three-eyed God’s killing intent was icy cold.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and struck out with his palm like lightning.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This first level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God was split into pieces by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the perfected spirit sea realm, it was a piece of cake for him to kill an expert of the first level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“The prison suppressing heavenly art must be controlled properly. It can’t be too explosive!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly warned himself.</p><p>As the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline was upgraded to level four of the divine tier, the prison suppressing heavenly technique’s power had reached the level of a low-grade divine tier martial technique. Its power was terrifying.</p><p>However, the amount of essential core consumed was absolutely unimaginable. If Lu Ming were to use the White hair prison destructive Divine Art at full force, his entire body of essential core would be drained dry in an instant. If he was not careful, he would not be able to release much power.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to stop upgrading the prison-suppressing stele bloodline for now. I’ll focus on upgrading the nine Dragons bloodline. Otherwise, the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique will be too strong, and my cultivation is too weak. It’ll be difficult for me to use it. I’ll think about it after I improve my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>As for the chosen of the chaotic clan and the others, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed a first level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God with one move. He was too powerful. His combat strength was definitely far above his.</p><p>However, he would still die in the face of so many three-eyed gods.</p><p>hmm, he’s quite strong. All of you, attack him together and kill him!</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed God race waved his hand, and seven to eight figures charged toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
