It’s a mixed energy token!</p><p>A cry of surprise came from the direction of the sky demon Valley, and it was the demon Emperor.</p><p>What matter could actually make a generation’s demon Emperor cry out in alarm?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the corpse Emperor and Martial Emperor Di Yi stood up from their seats, with a terrifying light shooting out of their eyes.</p><p>Many of the older generation seemed to have thought of something. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>And many of the younger generation looked at each other, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>What was a mixed essence token? How could he make the three emperors lose their composure?</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>He looked at the token in his hand.</p><p>The token was purple-gold in color and was cast from an unknown material. Two words were written on it: Primordial chaos.</p><p>congratulations on passing the initial test!</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>This voice was directly heard in Lu Ming’s mind. No one else could hear it.</p><p>“Who is it? Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in his heart.</p><p>However, there was no response. Lu Ming continued to call but there was still no reply.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>What did that voice mean? After passing the initial test, could there be another test?</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, the true dragon of Providence above Lu Ming’s head roared and shrank rapidly, turning into a beam of light and entering Lu Ming’s body, disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, the serpents, Dragons, and true dragons above the young heaven’s favorites ‘heads all turned into beams of light and entered their bodies.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient city of Providence trembled and burst out with a dazzling light.</p><p>Some of them flew toward the people of the sky demon Valley.</p><p>One of them entered the demon Emperor’s body.</p><p>The demon Emperor obtained the most.</p><p>Another portion flew toward the heavenly corpse sect and landed on their disciples. Similarly, the corpse Emperor obtained the most portion.</p><p>The other portion, which was even brighter than the light from the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley, flew toward the Emperor heaven divine Palace. Di Yi and Martial Emperor received the largest portion.</p><p>However, the largest portion flew towards the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>The talisman sect’s disciples, Bai Shijin, the two sect leaders of du songjue, the various elders, the nine suns Supreme, Yan kuangtu, and so on, all received a big ball of light.</p><p>Even elder Yun of the talisman Amulet sect had obtained more light than the corpse Emperor or the demon Emperor.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and du songjue had received more light than Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>The people from the other three factions looked at the talisman Amulet sect with envy.</p><p>This light was the legendary luck, which was extremely mysterious.</p><p>At this moment, if one were to look from the outside of the ancient city of Providence, one would be able to see that the entire ancient City of Providence was glowing. Beams of light flew in all directions towards the eastern wilderness.</p><p>Among them, the lights that flew towards the talisman sect were the largest and most numerous.</p><p>The speed of the light was unparalleled. It crossed layers of space in an instant and flew to the talisman sect.</p><p>At this moment, countless Talisman Amulet sect disciples were being nourished by the light.</p><p>Some of them had encountered a bottleneck in their cultivation and had been stuck in a realm for many years. However, when this ray of light rushed through them, they actually broke through the bottleneck and broke through to a new realm.</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s parents, Lu Yuntian, Li Ping, and the rest of the Lu family, they were also shrouded in a large amount of light.</p><p>Those who were close to Lu Ming would receive a lot of light.</p><p>Countless people were stunned and confused.</p><p>The talisman sect members in the ancient city of Providence were ecstatic.</p><p>This was the legendary ‘blessing with luck’, which was infinitely mysterious.</p><p>I don’t know what benefits there are. I’ll go back and experience it!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He felt that he was in high spirits and his thoughts were extremely clear. He could not feel anything else.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and returned to the talisman sect’s area.</p><p>It was time to leave. The battle of karmic luck had ended.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally achieved what he wanted to do.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, du songjue!”</p><p>Suddenly, a majestic voice was heard. Everyone was shocked because the voice came from Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Everyone looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Bai Shijin and du songjue’s expressions changed slightly, and they also looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s face was calm, but his eyes were sharp. He stared at Bai Shijin and du songjue and said, ” you should know that Lu Ming is the person I want. Now, Lu Ming has helped your Talisman Amulet sect to win first place in the battle of Providence. You have also benefited from it. Now, hand him over to me!</p><p>His voice was filled with a sense of superiority and unquestionable authority.</p><p>It was as if the other party had to do as he said.</p><p>In fact, in the East continent, not many people dared to refute the words of Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Di Yi was going to make trouble for the talisman sect. How should they deal with this?</p><p>Should they hand Lu Ming over or not?</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were on Bai Shijin and du songjue.</p><p>Bai Shijin and du songjue’s faces darkened.</p><p>Di Yi, Martial Emperor, you said it yourself. Lu Ming helped my Talisman Amulet sect win the battle of Providence and obtain great fortune. Do you think I, Bai Shijin, am an ungrateful person? ”</p><p>Bai Shijin looked at Di Yi and said slowly.</p><p>“I, du song, have lived for thousands of years. I still have a bottom line. There is no room for discussion on this matter!”</p><p>Du songjue spoke.</p><p>The two sect leaders of the talisman sect rejected Di Yi one after another.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi frowned slightly. Two Bright Lights shot out of his eyes, and an unparalleled Majesty spread out.</p><p>“You have to consider carefully. Is it worth it to sacrifice the entire Talisman Amulet sect for Lu Ming?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi spoke slowly, but it shocked everyone.</p><p>Was Martial Emperor Di Yi going to attack the talisman Amulet sect?</p><p>In the past, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had only slowly encroached on the territory of the talisman Amulet sect. Martial Emperor Di Yi had never personally attacked the talisman Amulet sect. Was he going to do it himself now?</p><p>This was definitely a big event that would shake the eastern barren territory and affect the future of the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Perhaps in the future, there would only be three overlords in the East continent, not four.</p><p>“I’ll keep you company!”</p><p>Du songjue responded strongly.</p><p>Di Yi, I don’t mind telling you that Lu Ming is the zongzi of the talisman sect. So, if Lu Ming is here, the talisman sect will die!</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by his words.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect?</p><p>What did it mean to be a zongzi? It meant that he was the future sect master of the talisman Amulet sect. He was the person who would take over as the sect master of the talisman Amulet sect. However, how could Lu Ming become the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect? Even though he had won first place in the battle of Providence.</p><p>As Lu Ming had always been cultivating in the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, it had not been long since he went to the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the zongzi of your Talisman Amulet sect?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi frowned even more, and his eyes became colder.</p><p>that’s right. Di Yi, listen well. Lu Ming is not only the zongzi of the talisman sect, but he is also the inheritor of Grandmaster Liao Cang!</p><p>Bai Shijin said, word for word.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
