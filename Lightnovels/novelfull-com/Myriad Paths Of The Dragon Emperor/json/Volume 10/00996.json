Go and ask Ling yunkong to send someone to bring ah Lei and ah Luo to the floating mountain. Let’s see how the old man will object when the raw rice is cooked!</p><p>...</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s eyes flickered with a scheming light.</p><p>“Alright, father, I’ll do it now!”</p><p>Xiao ning nodded and left the room in a hurry.</p><p>……</p><p>Lishui City was surrounded by swamps. Endless rivers, swamps, lakes, and land converged, and the entire territory was filled with water vapor.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming left Lishui City and headed north.</p><p>After tens of thousands of miles, countless lakes came into view.</p><p>This area was called the ten thousand Lake Plains. It was said that there were more than ten thousand lakes here.</p><p>There were large and small endless lakes. The large ones had a radius of ten thousand miles, while the small ones were only a few miles. They covered this vast area.</p><p>Lu Ming was here to comprehend the water concept.</p><p>At a glance, many figures could be seen walking on the lake.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>From time to time, sword Qi and water screens could be seen. Human warriors were killing the water demons in the lake.</p><p>There were countless lakes in the ten thousand Lake plain, so there were naturally many aquatic demonic beasts.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>A huge catfish, more than thirty meters long, emerged from the lake. It opened its mouth wide and bit at Lu Ming, wanting to swallow him in one bite.</p><p>His essential core exploded. Lu Ming took a step forward and stomped the catfish to death. Then, his devouring power burst forth and devoured the catfish’s blood essence.</p><p>As for the other demonic powers and blood, Lu Ming did not devour them because the scene would be too shocking and he was afraid that word would spread.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was difficult to improve due to his intent realm. Devouring the energy would not be of much use.</p><p>Of course, there was another way for Lu Ming’s water concept to improve quickly. That was to kill other martial artists and devour their concepts.</p><p>There were many people who had comprehended the water mentality in the vicinity of Lishui City, and any one of them would be one.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not do that.</p><p>If it was an enemy, Lu Ming would not show any mercy. However, he would not kill others to improve his intent realm just to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Stepping on the surface of the lake, he felt the water vapor in the air. Lu Ming’s mind sank into it and he continued to comprehend the concept of water.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming began to comprehend the concept of water in the boundless water.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension ability was terrifying. He was making great progress every day.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on a huge Lake.</p><p>The water in this Lake was very strange. It moved without any wind, as if it had a spiritual nature.</p><p>The water vapor in this Lake was the thickest, and the water concept comprehended was also particularly clear.</p><p>Therefore, it attracted many people to come here to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming also sat cross-legged on the lake, quietly comprehending and comprehending.</p><p>peak of level three beginning!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>His water concept had already reached the peak of the third level.</p><p>“Look, those are the disciples of the floating mountain martial school!”</p><p>At this moment, someone suddenly called out softly, attracting the attention of many people. They looked up at the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked up and saw some figures Walking in the Air, heading toward Lishui City.</p><p>There were a total of eight people. They were not old, most of them in their thirties.</p><p>“Desolate ning!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He saw desolate ning’s figure in the crowd.</p><p>“These are the disciples of the floating mountain martial school, and they are together with desolate ning. Could they be the people of Ling yunkong?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He thought of the sisters ah Luo and ah Lei.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked on the lake, following from a distance.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the Lishui City. Desolate ning and the others stepped on the air and entered.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the Xiao family’s residence, he saw that the main entrance was already surrounded by people.</p><p>“I wonder why the people of the floating mountain sect have come?”</p><p>“The leader is called Ling Kai. I’ve seen him before. He’s Ling yunkong’s subordinate!”</p><p>“What? Ling yunkong? Ling yunkong, one of the top ten heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain martial school?”</p><p>Exclamations came from the surroundings.</p><p>that’s right. I heard that Ling yunkong has taken a fancy to the Xiao sisters and wants to take them as his concubines. However, the Xiao sisters have always been against it. I guess he’s here to take them away!</p><p>“Directly taking him away, so overbearing?”</p><p>“Nonsense, who is Ling yunkong? So what if he was domineering? Who dares to resist?”</p><p>you’re right. I heard that Ling yunkong is a Playboy. The Xiao sisters are indeed beautiful. Ling yunkong is like a sheep entering a Tiger’s mouth!</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived when he heard the discussions around him.</p><p>Circulating his essential core, the people in front of Lu Ming were silently pushed away by him. Lu Ming walked forward.</p><p>“I’m not going, I won’t go even if I die!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just walked to the front when he heard a delicate cry.</p><p>Upon hearing it, he knew it was ah Luo’s voice.</p><p>Lu Ming looked forward and saw a group of young men standing in front of the Xiao family’s main gate. Opposite them stood Xiao Hongyun, the sisters ah Luo and ah Lei.</p><p>At this moment, the two sisters of the Xiao family were staring at the young man from the floating mountain martial school, Xiao Hongyun, and Xiao ning with anger.</p><p>“Not going? It’s your good fortune that Ling yunkong has taken a fancy to you, and many girls are envious of you. How dare you not go? As long as he served young master Ling well, he could have anything he wanted in the future. There are all kinds of cultivation resources available!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun chided with a dark face.</p><p>Many people in the crowd shook their heads. Xiao Hongyun’s words might not be true.</p><p>If he truly fell in love with a heaven’s favorite of the floating mountain martial school and married him, then it would naturally be like what Xiao Hongyun had said. However, Ling yunkong was a dissolute person by nature. He liked the new and disliked the old. If she followed him, she might not have a good ending.</p><p>I said I’m not going. If you want to go, you can go by yourself. Lei, let’s go find Grandpa!</p><p>A ‘an pulled a’ Lei and was about to run into the Xiao family mansion.</p><p>evil creatures, what you’re doing is placing the Xiao family in danger. How can I allow you to do as you please? stop right there!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun took a step forward and stood in front of the two sisters. A powerful aura rose from his body. With a wave of his hand, his true energy burst forth and formed a true energy cage, trapping the two sisters.</p><p>“Today, I have to go even if I don’t want to. Young master Kai, I’ll leave these two girls to you!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun looked at Ling Kai in a flattering manner.</p><p>well, these two little girls haven’t seen much of the world. They’ll be well-behaved after being trained by young master yunkong!</p><p>Ling Kai chuckled and asked for a thousand.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the Xiao family. Then, a group of people followed an old man out.</p><p>The old man was Xiao Zhan.</p><p>After seven days, Xiao Zhan had not fully recovered, but his aura was much stronger than seven days ago. It was obvious that he had recovered a part of his cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Zhan was like a wild lion, staring at Xiao Hongyun with wide eyes.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Ah ke and ah Lei shouted.</p><p>“Ah ke, ah Lei, don’t be afraid. Grandpa is here!”</p><p>After saying that, Xiao Zhan glared at Xiao Hongyun and roared, ” “You evil beast, they’re your blood nieces, and you’re in such a hurry to send them out?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
