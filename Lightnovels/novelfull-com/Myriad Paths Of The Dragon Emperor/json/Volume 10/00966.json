If the winner was not decided in half an hour, it would automatically be decided that the person who had the upper hand would win.</p><p>However, once a life-and-death battle was set, there was no time limit. It would only end when one party died in battle.</p><p>A life-and-death battle meant that there was no way out. They had to win, and if they lost, they would die. Even Supreme martial artists and emperors could not interfere.</p><p>One had to have great confidence in themselves before they dared to set a life-and-death battle.</p><p>Would Wang fentian dare to agree?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Wang fentian.</p><p>At this moment, Wang fentian’s eyes were filled with uncertainty. He fixed his gaze on Lu Ming as if he was trying to figure out the truth from his expression.</p><p>Was Lu Ming bluffing or did he really have such strong abilities? He dared to have a life-and-death battle with him?</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He could not make a judgment.</p><p>Moreover, he did not see the exact situation of Lu Ming’s battle with Luo Tian. He was not confident in Lu Ming’s strength.</p><p>“Do you dare or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again. His voice was calm but aggressive.</p><p>“Why should I agree to a life-and-death duel? In any case, I’m definitely going to win this battle!”</p><p>Wang fentian argued.</p><p>“What a joke. Since you think you’ve won, why don’t you agree to a life-and-death duel? Back in ninedragons, I almost killed your Wang family patriarch. You must hate me to the core, right? Ten thousand people want to kill me. Since they want to kill me and have the confidence to do so, why don’t they agree to a life-and-death battle? You’re afraid. You don’t have the confidence to kill me. You don’t have the confidence in this battle. You don’t have the confidence in yourself. How can you win against me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s every word was harsh and aggressive. Every word hit Wang fentian’s weak point.</p><p>He did not even have the confidence to win. How could he win against Lu Ming?</p><p>“Damn you, you little bastard!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan growled, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Back in ninedragons, he was almost beaten to death by Lu Ming. It was the shame of his life. Now, Lu Ming was bringing up the same thing again and even using it to pressure Wang fentian.</p><p>This made the patriarch of the Wang family furious.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you almost killed the old man. How would a young man dare to have a life-and-death battle with you? I think that Wang something Tian should just admit defeat and stop embarrassing himself here. The Wang family is a bunch of useless people!”</p><p>The fat man laughed, his words were full of insult.</p><p>This made the head of the Wang family and Wang fentian so angry that they almost exploded.</p><p>At this moment, Wang fentian’s face was flushed red. He was burning with anger and his killing intent was burning.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>Wang fentian roared.</p><p>He had to win this battle. If he still did not win after hearing Lu Ming’s words, his heart of martial arts would definitely be unstable. Moreover, the entire Wang family would become a laughing stock in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>He wanted to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes, turning him into ashes.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll fight to the death with Wang Fen!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“A battle of life and death!” yes! Wang fentian replied as a scorching aura shot up into the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Wang fentian’s bodies were glowing with a faint blood-red light. This meant that the life-and-death battle had been decided. It was useless to admit defeat until one side died in battle.</p><p>“Heaven burning flames!”</p><p>Wang fentian’s killing intent was cold, but his body was covered in raging flames.</p><p>Wang fentian’s entire body seemed to have turned into a man of fire. His muscles, bones, and even his hair were burning as if they had all turned into flames.</p><p>“Six fingers of heaven burning, one finger to destroy!”</p><p>Wang fentian strode forward and pointed with his finger.</p><p>A finger, hundreds of meters long and formed by flames, with a clear fingerprint on it, pointed at Lu Ming like the finger of God.</p><p>The terrifying heat and murderous intent burst out and surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Wang fentian used a terrifying killing move as soon as he made his move. Since he had agreed to a life-and-death battle, Wang fentian would let go of everything and fight with all his might.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out as Lu Ming burst out with dragon energy. His entire body was covered in dense scales, and four types of intents revolved around him. He threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist and the heaven burning finger collided.</p><p>The fist and the flaming finger collided, and waves of energy burst forth.</p><p>One side of the hundred-mile-wide fighting ring was covered in purple flames, while the other side was covered in four-colored light.</p><p>In the end, the flaming finger exploded. Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took two steps back.</p><p>“The fusion of destruction and fire intent!”</p><p>also, his cultivation is at the early stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>After exchanging a blow, Lu Ming had a rough estimate of Wang fentian’s strength.</p><p>Wang fentian had also comprehended two intents and had successfully fused them together. His destruction intent and fire intent had both reached the third level completion. When they were combined together, their destructive power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that this was the battle platform of the ancient city of Providence, everything within hundreds of miles would have been destroyed and turned into lava.</p><p>Furthermore, Wang fentian’s cultivation was higher than Luo Tian’s, at the early stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Wang fentian was indeed the fifth-ranked Supreme talent on the list of top 1000 talents. His strength was terrifying.</p><p>“Heaven burning six fingers, two finger suppression!”</p><p>“Heaven burning six fingers, three finger break!”</p><p>“Heaven burning six fingers, four finger termination!”</p><p>Wang fentian’s fire quintessential essence exploded as he pointed out three times.</p><p>Three huge fingers in the shape of a triangle flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>The essential core in Lu Ming’s body roared and boiled. He circulated the prison-suppressing heaven technique to 50% of its power.</p><p>If his current prison suppressing heaven technique were to be fully unleashed, it would be equivalent to the power of a low-grade God-tier martial technique. Even if a low-grade God-tier martial technique was equivalent to the first stage of a low-grade God-tier martial technique, only a spiritual God Realm powerhouse would be able to unleash its full power.</p><p>He was now at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm. He didn’t have enough vital essence, so it was impossible for him to release all of his power.</p><p>However, 50% of its power was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw three punches in a row. The power of the prison-suppressing stele burst forth and suppressed everything.</p><p>The three flaming fingers were immediately destroyed, turning into flames and dissipating.</p><p>Wang fentian’s expression changed slightly. He waved his hands and pointed out two more fingers.</p><p>heaven burning six fingers! Five fingers are broken! Six fingers burn the heavens!</p><p>The two finger forces were pointed out one after another, and the space trembled like a piece of cloth. Wherever the finger forces passed, the space turned into a vacuum.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. This force was extremely hot, as if it wanted to turn him into ashes.</p><p>The four wills surrounded him, forming a suit of armor that covered his entire body. Lu Ming strode forward and threw two more punches.</p><p>Two earth-shaking rumbles sounded, and it was as if the entire ancient City of Providence was shaking violently.</p><p>A terrifying force swept out in all directions, but it was blocked by an invisible energy at the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>The two flaming fingers were crushed by Lu Ming with one blow and collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, breaking through the obstruction of the flames like an ancient God, and charged at Wang fentian.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
