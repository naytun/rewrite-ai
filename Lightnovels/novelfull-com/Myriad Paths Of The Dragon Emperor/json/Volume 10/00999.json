His face was completely deformed, blood constantly oozing out of his mouth, and his body was twitching. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>...</p><p>The surrounding onlookers were tongue-tied and couldn’t speak for a long time.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun, who was at the fifth level of the spirit embryo realm, was completely defenseless in Lu Ming’s hands. Lu Ming’s strength had suddenly become unfathomable in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>“What’s the use of a person like you living in this world? I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold murderous intent.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun felt Lu Ming’s killing intent and shivered. He sobered up and broke out in a cold sweat. He crawled toward Xiao Zhan with all his might and shouted,”Dad, dad, save me, save me! I won’t do it again! I was wrong this time! Save me!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s gaze was complicated. He sighed and cupped his fists to Lu Ming.”Little brother Lu, can you let him off this time?”</p><p>After all, Xiao Hongyun was his son and his last son. Xiao Zhan could not bear to see him being killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head in his heart. He had already known this outcome.</p><p>Xiao Zhan valued friendship too much. Although he was disappointed in Xiao Hongyun, he didn’t want to see him die.</p><p>“Since senior Xiao has spoken, I’ll spare him this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In his eyes, it didn’t matter whether he killed Xiao Hongyun or not, because he didn’t care at all.</p><p>Why should he care about something that he could kill with a single slap?</p><p>“Big brother Lu, I didn’t expect you to be so powerful.”</p><p>An ‘an jogged over and looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>A ‘Lei was standing behind a’ an. She blinked her big eyes and peeked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had far exceeded their expectations. It seemed that even their grandfather was not a match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and turned to Xiao Zhan. “Senior Xiao, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>It was obvious that Ling yunkong would not let the matter rest.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, let’s go in and talk!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked into the Xiao family mansion with Xiao Zhan, ah Luo, and ah Lei.</p><p>“Ling yunkong shouldn’t be here so soon. I plan to disband the Xiao family and then take ah Lei and ah Zhen away. However, I feel bad for implicating you this time.”</p><p>Xiao Zhan bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a burst of vital essence spread out, dragging Xiao Zhan along. “Senior, you don’t have to be so polite. Ah Lei and I are also considered friends. I can’t just watch them being taken away by the people of the floating mountain sect. Moreover, I’m alone, so I’m not afraid of the floating mountain sect.”</p><p>Feeling Lu Ming’s vast vital essence, Xiao Zhan found that he couldn’t bow down even a little bit. He was secretly shocked. In his eyes, Lu Ming was even more unfathomable.</p><p>“This old man really can’t repay little brother’s great kindness!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan cupped his hands and said.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had cured him of his poison. This time, he had saved ah Luo and her sister. They were really indebted to him.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Xiao Zhan ordered the entire Xiao family to pack their things and leave in batches at night.</p><p>The Xiao family of Lishui City could no longer be kept.</p><p>Half a day passed, and night fell.</p><p>The disciples of the Xiao family disappeared into the night in batches.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xiao Zhan, and the sisters, ah Luo and ah Lei, were sitting in the courtyard, drinking tea slowly.</p><p>“Master, let this old servant stay and take care of you!”</p><p>An old man with a head full of white hair stood beside Xiao Zhan and pleaded.</p><p>The old man was very old, but he was full of energy. However, his eyes were full of sadness and reluctance.</p><p>“Grandpa Quan!”</p><p>Ah Luo and ah Lei were also full of reluctance.</p><p>The old man’s name was Feng Quan. He had been in the Xiao family for more than a hundred years and was now the Xiao family’s butler. He had watched ah ke and ah Lei grow up and had deep feelings for the Xiao family.</p><p>Quan, it’s very dangerous to follow us. You still have a family. Let’s go. If there’s a chance, we’ll meet again!</p><p>Xiao Zhan said. He was helpless, but this was the only thing he could do.</p><p>If they stayed, they would all die when Ling yunkong and his men arrived. Their only chance of survival was to leave.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s attitude was firm, and Feng Quan had no choice but to say goodbye to Xiao Zhan and the others.</p><p>“Grandpa, it’s all our fault!”</p><p>Ah Luo and ah Lei were in tears.</p><p>If it wasn’t for them, how could such a thing happen?</p><p>“You two silly girls, don’t let your thoughts run wild!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan chuckled and turned to Lu Ming. brother Lu, it’s getting late. You should leave now. We’ll disguise ourselves and leave the city at dawn!</p><p>Lu Ming had already helped them a lot. He did not want to continue implicating Lu Ming.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, footsteps were heard in the courtyard.</p><p>In the next moment, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning appeared and walked in.</p><p>“What are you guys doing here? Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan coldly rebuked.</p><p>Plop! Plop!</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning both knelt down in front of Xiao Zhan.</p><p>“Father, I was wrong. I know I was wrong. I was blinded by greed in the past. That was why I thought of using ah Lei and ah Luo to curry favor with Ling yunkong. That’s why it ended up like this. I was wrong!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun repeatedly kowtowed to Xiao Zhan, crying bitterly.</p><p>Then, he kowtowed to Lu Ming. this time, it’s all thanks to young master Lu that I’ve come to my senses. I’ve finally realized how wrong I was in what I did previously. Thank you, young master Lu!</p><p>Xiao ning also followed Xiao Hongyun and kowtowed.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>Xiao Zhan also frowned.</p><p>“Father, I only hope that you can forgive me. Then, I will bring ning to Ling yunkong and plead for mercy. This will buy you some time so that you and ah Zhen can go further away!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said, his eyes full of sincerity.</p><p>“Grandfather, you see, second uncle also knows his mistake, so please forgive him!”</p><p>A-Qing said in a low voice.</p><p>“Yes, Grandpa!”</p><p>Lei also said.</p><p>The two sisters were very kind. Seeing that Xiao Hongyun seemed to be sincere, their hearts softened and they pleaded for Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>Pa! “Pa!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Xiao Hongyun slapped his own face continuously. As he slapped, he shouted, ” father, I was wrong. Please forgive me.</p><p>In a few moments, both sides of Xiao Hongyun’s face were swollen.</p><p>alright, it’s good that you know you’re wrong. Everyone makes mistakes. As long as you remember in the future, opportunities should be grasped by yourselves and not exchanged by sacrificing your loved ones.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiao Zhan’s heart softened and he sighed.</p><p>“Thank you, Father!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun smiled and said,”Dad, I don’t know when we’ll meet again. I’ve prepared a banquet in the lobby. I’ve not gathered with you and my two nieces for a long time. Just take it as a farewell to my nieces!”</p><p>“Banquet? No need, it’s fine as long as you have the heart.”</p><p>Xiao Zhan said.</p><p>father, this is a small token of my appreciation. After this farewell, we may never see each other again!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun sighed, revealing a regretful and sad expression.</p><p>“Grandpa, let’s go then. I think second uncle is sincere.”</p><p>Ah Luo whispered, and ah Lei nodded.</p><p>“Well, alright then!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
