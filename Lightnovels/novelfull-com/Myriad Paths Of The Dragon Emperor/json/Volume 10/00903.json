It seems like he didn’t succeed. It just so happens that you’re the person the Martial Emperor ancestor wants. If I cripple you and bring you back to the Martial Emperor ancestor, I’ll definitely make a great contribution!</p><p>A powerful aura emanated from di Feng, as a sharp sword Qi burst forth from him.</p><p>as I said before, if you want to kill me, you have to be prepared to be killed by me. Di Yi’s descendant, you should collect some interest first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Di Feng waved his hand, and seven figures appeared behind him.</p><p>The seven figures were all men of sacrifice wearing black robes and carrying long swords on their backs.</p><p>In reality, there were over 20 people in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. There were over 10 death Warriors, and the rest were the young geniuses and genius characters.</p><p>It was obvious that di Feng was the leader.</p><p>Each of the seven death Warriors had a cultivation at the peak of the ninth level spiritual ocean realm. The seven of them worked together to form a battle formation that was seamless as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi swept across, and the sword radiance was like a net that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and the sword radiance was shattered. The huge palm force made the seven men of sacrifice spit out blood and fly back.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>His left palm clenched into a fist and a terrifying devouring force erupted. The seven men of sacrifice could not control their bodies at all and were devoured by Lu Ming. Their blood essence, true vitality, and even intent runes were all devoured by Lu Ming. In the blink of an eye, they turned into seven dried corpses.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>Directly devouring people into mummies, this scene was too evil.</p><p>“What an overbearing demonic technique!”</p><p>A Paragon from the heavenly corpse sect cried out in shock.</p><p>The cultivation techniques of the heavenly corpse sect were all evil and powerful. Some of them could also turn people into mummies, but the speed was not as fast as this. It was too overbearing.</p><p>“Evil and crooked path, must be cut off!”</p><p>Di Feng’s voice was ice-cold, filled with killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword clashing rang out as di Feng stepped out. A terrifying sword might burst forth, and a golden sword Qi slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>With four concepts surrounding him, Lu Ming struck out with his palm and collided with the golden sword radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion sounded, and the golden sword radiance dissipated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re quite capable, but you’re still too inexperienced to fight me!”</p><p>Di Feng let out a long howl as a golden combat sword appeared above his head. A Golden Dragon was coiled around the hilt of the sword, giving off a mighty aura and endless sword light.</p><p>Four golden chakras were floating around the combat sword.</p><p>Divine level fourth rank bloodline.</p><p>the Emperor sword is a bloodline unique to the DI family!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was said that the direct bloodline of the DI family, headed by Martial Emperor Di Yi, had been passed down through the bloodline of the Emperor sword.</p><p>Of course, the same bloodline had different levels. Some were Level 1 deities, while others were Level 2 deities.</p><p>The power was also completely different.</p><p>“I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>Di Feng’s cold voice rang out. His body transformed into a ray of light, merging into the Emperor sword. Instantly, the sword Qi soared into the sky, and the sword power was vast and mighty.</p><p>The Emperor sword moved and the wind and clouds were split in half. The terrifying combat sword slashed down at Lu Ming’s head, intending to split him in half.</p><p>Di Feng was indeed very strong. His cultivation was at the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and the cultivation technique he cultivated was undoubtedly a divine level cultivation technique. With the addition of the fourth level divine bloodline Emperor sword, the power he could unleash was extremely terrifying. He could definitely fight with an expert of the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current combat strength was more than just at the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately burst out with dragon energy, and scales appeared. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch at the combat sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A melodious voice was heard. The Emperor sword trembled continuously and was actually sent flying.</p><p>The others were shocked. Di Feng, ranked 101st on the list of top 1000 talents, was actually sent flying by a single punch from Lu Ming. How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so terrifying? could it be that he had already surpassed di Feng?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, clenched his fist, and punched the Emperor sword again.</p><p>“World-slaying sword!”</p><p>Di Feng’s furious roar came from the Emperor sword. The sword power was vast and the killing intent was sharp as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword and the fist collided, and the Emperor sword trembled even more violently.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fist and attacked again. The Emperor sword trembled continuously and the sword power that was spreading from the sword was weakening.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the Emperor sword exploded, revealing di Feng’s figure. His face was filled with fear and disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had surpassed him in all aspects. How was this possible? He found it hard to accept.</p><p>Back at the ninedragons ‘exchange meet, although Lu Ming was strong, di Feng was 100% confident that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>During this period of time, his cultivation level had increased again. However, he was not Lu Ming’s match and was defeated.</p><p>Why was Lu Ming’s improvement speed so terrifying?</p><p>“So what if your cultivation is stronger than mine? Can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he strode forward, charging towards di Feng.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Di Feng did not hesitate, turning into a beam of light as he flew towards the other side.</p><p>Although there were many people at the entrance of the canyon, di Feng was clear that none of them could stop Lu Ming. If they stayed, they would definitely be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You want to leave? have you asked me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out, his body like a stream of light, chasing after di Feng.</p><p>Di Feng was terrified. He took out a seventh-level spiritual weapon, but it was broken into two by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch was so powerful that it pierced through the void, causing di Feng to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Di Feng was even more shocked and desperately tried to escape.</p><p>At this moment, a purple light was approaching them at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Wang Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. That figure was Wang Yan.</p><p>“Wang Yan, save me!”</p><p>Seeing Wang Yan, di Feng was overjoyed and rushed towards Wang Yan with all his might.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not dead!”</p><p>Wang Yan was shocked to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, when they were crossing the abyss, he had given Lu Ming a fatal blow and even ordered the death warrior to snipe Lu Ming. Under that situation, the round platform had already collapsed. He concluded that Lu Ming had fallen into the abyss and died.</p><p>He was naturally shocked to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Like a purple flame, Wang Yan crossed the void and appeared in front of di Feng.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really lucky. Alright, since that’s the case, let me finish you off myself!”</p><p>On Wang Yan’s body, purple flames danced. With Wang Yan as the center, it directly formed a black hole. Over there, other than him, it seemed as if everyone else’s physical matter had been burned to ashes.</p><p>I’ve said it before. I’ll definitely kill you. Now that I’ve run into you, it’s just right!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not stop as he pounced towards Wang Yan.</p><p>Compared to di Feng, he wanted to kill Wang Yan more.</p><p>A fist covered in scales flew towards Wang Yan. At the same time, Wang Yan also stepped forward and threw a punch.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
