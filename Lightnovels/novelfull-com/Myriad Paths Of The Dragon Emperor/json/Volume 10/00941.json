Luo Tian did not consider his life at all.</p><p>“Haha, too much? It’s your honor to be able to help me, you piece of trash. If you don’t hand it over, I’ll kill you immediately!”</p><p>Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with demonic energy and his killing intent became even colder.</p><p>hehe, Luo Tian, Who Do You Think You Are? ”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly sneered. He then took a step forward and dashed to the side at top speed.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Luo Tian was stunned for a moment. Then, he let out an angry roar and slashed his palm at Lu Ming like a knife.</p><p>The terrifying saber flare almost split the poisonous gas apart. The surrounding poisonous gas rolled as the saber flare approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out. Lu Ming exploded with all his dragon energy. At the same time, the mountain and river diagram rushed out and surrounded him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with the saber radiance. A terrifying explosion rang out and the poisonous gas nearby was dispersed. Lu Ming felt waves of incomparably terrifying saber radiance surging towards him.</p><p>However, most of it was blocked by the mountain and river diagram. However, there was still a portion that surged into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>There were a few more wounds on Lu Ming’s body, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Lu Ming made use of this force to retreat backward a thousand meters. He then ran to the side.</p><p>what an overbearing saber technique! What a powerful combat strength!</p><p>A stream of blood seeped out from the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth. The scales on his fist burst open, revealing a deep cut so deep that the bone could be seen.</p><p>Luo Tian’s strength was far above his. No wonder he was ranked tenth on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Eh? So you do have some strength!”</p><p>Luo Tian frowned and his killing intent grew colder.</p><p>Although he did not use his full strength in that move just now, there were not many people who could block his blade.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, and his body was like a flash of light as he chased after Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Brat, you have so many treasures on you. You’d better hand them all over, or I’ll make you die an ugly death!”</p><p>Luo Tian’s voice was cold.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He broke into a run.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Luo Tian shouted as a black demonic blade appeared in his hand. He slashed with all his might.</p><p>A thousand-meter-long astral blade formed and broke through the poisonous gas. It cut through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This slash was several times more powerful than the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming did not fight it head-on. His figure flashed to the side rapidly. However, the saber Light actually moved along with him and slashed down at high speed.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming managed to Dodge it. However, he was still hit by the sharp edge of the saber energy. The mountain and river diagram shook violently. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>With his injuries, it was difficult for him to maintain his disguise and return to his original appearance.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>After seeing Lu Ming’s true appearance, Luo Tian let out an angry roar and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming, it’s you! How dare you kill my brother Luo Li! Die! Die! I’ll make sure you die without a burial place!</p><p>Demonic Qi surged from Luo Tian’s body and his speed increased to a terrifying level. He was like a demonic blade that cut through the air. He was actually a little faster than Lu Ming.</p><p>he’s so strong. This Luo Tian’s cultivation is only at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, but his combat strength is too terrifying. Even geniuses like Wang Chen and Nangong Bo, who are at the same level as Luo Tian, would be easily killed by him!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>Luo Tian’s strength was extremely terrifying. He could not be measured by ordinary Warriors or even Ordinary Geniuses.</p><p>Other than a few people, Luo Tian was basically invincible in a battle of the same level. Furthermore, his cultivation was three levels higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Lu Ming changed his direction and rushed toward the depths of the sky Poison Island. The poisonous gas was thicker there, which was to his advantage.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Luo Tian shouted angrily and chased after him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had gone another hundred miles.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>Suddenly, a buzzing sound came from ahead. It was a group of poisonous bees.</p><p>There were basically no living creatures here, but there were still so many poisonous bees. These poisonous bees were absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“Luo Tian, I’ll let you have a taste of the poisonous bee!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not stop. He charged directly at the poisonous bees and threw a punch at the same time. A Flaming Fist radiance rushed into the poisonous bees.</p><p>This time, it was as if he had poked the hornet’s nest. The poisonous bees were in a frenzy. They seemed to be very angry and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used the mountain and river diagram to block the attacks. Bang, bang, bang. The poisonous bees kept hitting the mountain and river diagram, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and ran toward Luo Tian.</p><p>“Damn you, you’re crazy!”</p><p>Luo Tian bellowed and slashed out a shocking saber flare. Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge it. Although he did not manage to avoid it completely and was shocked to the point of spitting blood, the saber flare cut down a bunch of poisonous bees. The rest flew angrily towards Luo Tian.</p><p>There was a long tube at the head of each bee. Poisonous gas of various colors spewed out from the tube and spread toward Luo Tian.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>The demonic armor on Luo Tian’s body made a sound of corrosion. He was so frightened that his face turned pale and he ran away.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t let me see you again. I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Luo Tian’s voice could be heard, but he had already disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming ran forward in large strides. A group of poisonous bees kept chasing him. Fortunately, he could devour poisonous gas, so the poisonous gas of the poisonous bees was ineffective against him. The mountain and river diagram could also defend against the poisonous bees ‘attacks. Not long after, Lu Ming shook off the poisonous bees and continued on his way.</p><p>After a thousand miles, a huge mountain appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent rumble came from the foot of the mountain.</p><p>There seemed to be a great battle going on.</p><p>“Who is it? Could it be that the human race’s heaven’s favorite has eliminated me? There’s still someone who can make it this far?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. According to his speculation, Luo Tian should not have been able to reach this place. He immediately concealed his aura and approached carefully.</p><p>When they walked closer, they found a cave at the bottom of the mountain. The rumbling sound came from the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming found a secret place to hide and looked in front.</p><p>Not long after, the rumbling sounds in the cave disappeared. A golden light flashed and a figure rushed out of the cave.</p><p>“The Golden pool!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>That figure was actually Jinchi.</p><p>On top of the Golden pool, there was a golden bead that scattered down rays of sword light, helping the Golden pool to block the poisonous gas outside.</p><p>However, it was obvious that it could not completely block it. The green gas on Jinchi’s face was clearly poisonous.</p><p>“Damned beast!”</p><p>Jinchi growled and glared at the cave. Then, he found a place, took out a pile of raw stones, and began to absorb them.</p><p>He did not notice Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that he had fought with something in the cave and his Zhen Yuan had been severely depleted. Now he was out to absorb the raw stones to recover his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Half an hour later, Jinchi got up and rushed into the cave again. The sound of a battle could be heard from the cave again.</p><p>Not long after, Jinchi roared and rushed out of the cave.</p><p>This time, he was in a worse state. His hair was disheveled, and the Golden feather clothes on his body were shattered. The Golden bead on his head was also shattered, and the golden light that scattered was greatly reduced. The green gas on Jin Chi’s face was even thicker. It was obvious that he was more deeply poisoned, and his aura was much weaker than before.</p><p>He looked at the cave unwillingly, but he did not dare to stay and rushed out.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He took a step forward and dashed toward the Golden pool at top speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
