He founded the Ditian divine Palace and made it the biggest human force in the East barren. He was so famous and powerful that some people called him the number one emperor in the East barren.</p><p>...</p><p>Even the corpse Emperor was weaker.</p><p>Moreover, Bai Shijin and the others knew that it was Di Yi who had secretly killed Lian Cang. They hated and feared Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>When Martial Emperor Di Yi appeared, he looked directly at the talisman sect like two extremely sharp divine swords.</p><p>Although Martial Emperor Di Yi was completely suppressed here, it still gave people a lot of pressure. Bai Shijin, du songjue, Meng Chong, and the others all changed their expressions as if a huge rock was pressing on their hearts.</p><p>Only one person looked calm as he stared at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Yan Kuang tu!</p><p>Yan kuangtu and the talisman Amulet sect had also entered this place.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyebrows flashed, and the nine suns Supreme Master walked out.</p><p>After a year, the soul of the nine suns Supreme had become many times more solid than it was a year ago. It was almost solid, and its soul power was strong and stable.</p><p>He also looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>A bright light burst out of Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes, and a strong killing intent filled the air. Although he did not speak, he had made it clear.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think that hiding in the talisman Amulet sect will be of any use?”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan looked at Yan kuangtu and the others with cold eyes.”Your Talisman Amulet sect will also be destroyed sooner or later!”</p><p>I wonder how many people from the talisman Amulet sect will be able to make it to the ancient city of Providence in this battle of Providence. I hope they don’t all die!</p><p>The master of the Jiang family said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, the disciples of the talisman Amulet sect will naturally have their own opportunities!”</p><p>Bai Shijin said in a deep voice.</p><p>it’s useless to be stubborn. Soon, you’ll see the reality!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan said coldly.</p><p>This time, Bai Shijin and the others didn’t reply. There was no point in saying more.</p><p>Di Yi, I don’t know what you’re thinking. You have two such powerful disciples. You don’t even want your grand-disciple, which makes me very jealous!</p><p>At this time, a voice came from another direction.</p><p>It was a woman’s voice, but it was full of charm. It made people’s hearts beat faster and their hearts tremble.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned towards the source of the voice.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the air. The demons of the sky demon Valley had arrived.</p><p>One of the women was about 30 years old. She was wearing a thin veil that revealed her devilish figure. Her appearance was enough to turn all living beings upside down. Any man who saw her would feel their heart skip a beat.</p><p>Her every move, every frown, and every smile was filled with endless temptation.</p><p>“Demon Emperor!”</p><p>Central’s heart trembled.</p><p>The demon Emperor of the sky demon Valley was said to be a nine-tailed fox, a pure-blooded nine-tailed fox.</p><p>A pureblood nine-tailed fox was a divine beast. Even though a nine-tailed fox was not particularly strong among divine beasts, it was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>Today, the three Supreme existences of the East continent, Di Yi, the Martial Emperor, the demon Emperor, and the corpse Emperor, had all arrived. This was a rare occasion that only happened once in a thousand years.</p><p>In the eastern wastelands, the number of emperors could be counted with a finger. Each one of them was a Supreme existence.</p><p>Without a doubt, Di Yi’s Martial Emperor, demon Emperor, and corpse Emperor were the strongest among the emperors.</p><p>Although the demonic sky sovereign was also a sovereign, he was weaker than the three of them. Back then, the demonic sky sovereign had only stopped the avatar of Martial Emperor Diyi. Now, it was obvious that the real body of Martial Emperor Diyi had returned from the sea.</p><p>In comparison, the talisman Amulet sect was too weak.</p><p>“Hmph, they’re just a pair of unfilial disciples. The demon Emperor must be laughing at us!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi said coldly.</p><p>“Is he really a traitorous disciple? Why didn’t the rumors I heard say this? Di Yi, you have seized the bloodline of the nine suns and the blood essence of the nine Dragons. What do you want? I’m very curious.”</p><p>The demon Emperor said with a smile.</p><p>This smile made many people’s hearts beat faster. In their shock, they quickly looked away, not daring to look at the demon Emperor.</p><p>This was also because everyone present had profound cultivation and had cultivated for many years. Even the weakest of them was a spiritual God Realm master. If those young people saw this, they would probably lose their minds and be unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t answer.</p><p>The demon Emperor looked at Di Yi and smiled. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>Then, the entire place fell silent. Everyone’s eyes fell on the stairs.</p><p>……</p><p>Within the three-eyed God race’s capital, everyone was looking up at the sky, at the massive object that had just appeared.</p><p>that’s the ancient city of Providence? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, beams of light appeared from the ancient city of Providence and landed on every young genius who was participating in the battle of Providence.</p><p>At this moment, no matter where they were, no matter which ruins they were in, or which forbidden area they were in, as long as they were not dead, a beam of light would descend from the sky and envelop them.</p><p>Then, the space trembled and the figure disappeared.</p><p>In the capital, those heaven’s favorites disappeared one by one.</p><p>It was the same for Lu Ming. The light pillar shook and his figure disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming found himself on a huge platform. Lights were flashing all around him and figures kept appearing.</p><p>Lu Ming saw di Shen and the other elites of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, the heavenly demon Valley, and the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Huan Zhen, Wen Qishi, Bai chixue and the rest were all there. They smiled and walked over when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>The geniuses of the four Overlord forces all gathered according to their forces.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Huan Zhen walked over and said.</p><p>“It’s fine. This time, I really have to thank you for the inscription talisman scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at Huan Zhen.</p><p>Without Huan Zhen’s inscription scroll, Lu Ming might not be able to snatch the last totem pole even if he used all his strength.</p><p>If he were to use his full strength, the others would definitely try to stop him. How would he be able to snatch the totem pillar?</p><p>With the help of the inscription scroll, he was able to take the totem pole by surprise.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Huan Zhen’s eyes lit up. Did Lu Ming succeed?</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wen Qinyi, Bai chixue and the rest came over to greet Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and responded to them one by one.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, I knew you would be fine!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, fatty carried his axe and walked over. Ruan Tingting and fatty walked side by side.</p><p>“Fatty, Tingting!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Since the beginning of the battle of Providence, Lu Ming had not met fatty and ruan Tingting. To be honest, he was quite worried that something would happen to the two of them. Now that he saw them, he was naturally happy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Tingting was worried that something would happen to you. I knew it. What can those pieces of trash do to you?”</p><p>The fatty grinned and looked at the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the sky demon Valley in disdain.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence, the two forces had wanted to kill Lu Ming without mercy.</p><p>Upon hearing the Fatty’s words, the few forces immediately cast cold killing intent at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
