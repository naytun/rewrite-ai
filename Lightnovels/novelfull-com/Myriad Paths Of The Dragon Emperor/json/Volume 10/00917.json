They looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you think my Talisman Amulet sect has no one?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold. A murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>there are four of us. Why should we be afraid of him? moreover, our cultivation and abilities have improved by leaps and bounds during this period of time. We might be able to improve even faster than Lu Ming. If the four of us join forces, we’ll be able to kill him!</p><p>A hint of viciousness and greed flashed in Kong mingshang’s eyes.</p><p>Killing Lu Ming would earn him a huge reward from the Wang family Supreme martial artist. This made him very tempted.</p><p>When the other three heard Kong mingshang’s words, they were very tempted.</p><p>Lu Ming was strong in the past, but that did not mean that he would always be strong. During this period of time, they had made great progress. They did not believe that the four of them could not kill Lu Ming with their combined strength.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Kong mingshang with a half-smile and a hint of contempt flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Attack! Let’s attack together and kill him!”</p><p>Kong mingshang growled.</p><p>Being looked at by Lu Ming with such a gaze, Kong Ming still felt very uncomfortable.</p><p>He was ranked 198th on the list of top 1000 talents and yet Lu Ming was looking at him with such contempt. Who was Lu Ming?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The four of them roared and attacked at the same time, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The dazzling Saber Light and the boundless corpse Qi enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Zongzi, be careful!”</p><p>The two talisman sect disciples exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He did not move but took a step forward.</p><p>Countless inscriptions emerged from under Lu Ming’s feet. A large array appeared out of thin air. A fierce tiger with blazing flames condensed and roared at the sky.</p><p>Kong mingshang and the other three were shocked, and their pupils contracted.</p><p>he carved an array in the void. He’s a level-seven Alchemist!</p><p>this is a level Seven formation!</p><p>“No, spare my life!”</p><p>The four of them screamed in fear.</p><p>However, the next moment, the flaming Tiger pounced and tore the four of them apart.</p><p>Naturally, after killing four people, Lu Ming’s luck value increased a little.</p><p>The two Talisman Amulet sect disciples were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Zongzi Lu Ming, you’ve advanced to a rank 7 Alchemist?”</p><p>The young woman was overjoyed.</p><p>All the young prodigies of the talisman Amulet sect knew that Lu Ming had lit up ten spirit lamps in the first five levels. After that, Lu Ming entered the observatory and the spirit lamps he lit at the sixth level were definitely not bad. With such a Foundation, Lu Ming would definitely be very strong when he broke through to a seventh-rank Alchemist. Naturally, they would be happy.</p><p>“What?” “What are your names?” Lu Ming nodded and asked.</p><p>“Zongzi, I’m hai Fei, he’s Liu Guang!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>The two of them looked quite intimate, so they should be a couple.</p><p>“I heard you say that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect are capturing the disciples of our Talisman Amulet sect to help them break the array formation in the ruins. What exactly is going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’s like this. The heavenly corpse sect, the heavenly demon Valley, and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace have discovered a huge ruin. However, the ruins are surrounded by array formations that are extremely powerful. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect can’t break through the array formations with their half-baked Dao of inscription. Therefore, they have set their sights on the disciples of the talisman Amulet sect. The three parties have joined forces to capture the disciples of the talisman Amulet sect and help them break the array formation. I heard that some of the disciples of the talisman Amulet sect have already died while trying to break the array formation!</p><p>Hai Fei gritted her teeth and said.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He was treating the talisman Amulet sect disciples as tools.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that there aren’t any experts from our Talisman Amulet sect to fight against them?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>No. hai Fei shook her head. the 13 zongzis aren’t here, and the enemy is too strong. Even if someone tries to fight them, they’ll die.</p><p>that’s right. I heard that many heaven’s pride experts from the three forces have gathered there. There are even quite a few of them who are ranked in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents. The strongest ones are the little demon Lord Luo Li, the Li-fire sword Li Tian Ge, the Blood Sword seven and the Blood Sword nine from the heavenly corpse sect, and the two heaven’s pride experts from the heavenly demon Valley who are no weaker than the Li-fire sword and the little demon Lord!</p><p>Liu Guang added.</p><p>“Little demon Lord, is there still brother Litian?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Among them, brother Litian was the highest ranked on the list of top 1000 talents at 51st place. He was ten places higher than little demon Lord Luo Li.</p><p>Of course, it had been more than four years since the last update of the list of top 1000 talents. Brother Litian’s combat strength might not be stronger than the little demon Lord’s, but he was definitely not to be underestimated.</p><p>“Where are the ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Zongzi, do you really want to go? But the other side is so powerful.” Hai Fei was a little worried.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you afraid? If you’re scared, tell me the address. I’ll go alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the future, he would take control of the talisman Amulet sect. In his opinion, these paragons of the talisman Amulet sect would become the pillars of the sect and his powerful helpers. How could he let them die Here?</p><p>Lu Ming would definitely go and save them. Also, it was time to settle the score with the little demon Lord. He had wasted so many puppets.</p><p>“No, I’m not afraid. If zongzi wants to go, I’ll go with him. Liu Guang, what about you?”</p><p>Hai Fei gritted her teeth, then looked at Liu Guang.</p><p>“Since you’re going, I’m naturally going too!”</p><p>Liu Guang’s determined gaze warmed hai Fei’s heart.</p><p>haha, alright, then you guys lead the way. We’ll go together!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>The three of them immediately tore through the void and headed toward the ruins that hai Fei had mentioned.</p><p>……</p><p>There was a huge legacy site more than a hundred thousand miles away from Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>This was a group of palaces. They looked very old, and some places were already somewhat dilapidated.</p><p>In all directions of the palace complex, there were all kinds of killing formations, illusory formations, overlapping each other, making it extremely dangerous.</p><p>This place was first discovered by the paragons of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect, but they couldn’t enter at all. They even lost a lot of people in the formation.</p><p>In the end, they could only gather the nearby heaven’s pride experts to crack the array together. In the end, even the heaven’s pride experts of the sky demon Valley joined in.</p><p>However, they realized that it was too difficult to break these arrays. Even if they could break them, they didn’t know how long it would take. Therefore, they began to target the talisman Amulet sect disciples and captured them everywhere.</p><p>Outside the ruins, the Supreme talents of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley, as well as some suicide soldiers, numbered more than 300 people.</p><p>They surrounded the dozen Talisman Amulet sect disciples in the middle.</p><p>alright, we’ve rested enough. Let’s set off now and continue to crack the array!</p><p>Little demon Lord Luo Li’s eyes glowed with a murderous light as he stared at the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>don’t even think about it. If you want to break it, you can do it yourself. We won’t go again. In the past three days, six of our senior and junior brothers have died in order to break the formation!</p><p>A crisp sound was heard.</p><p>It was Bai chixue, who was also caught by them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
