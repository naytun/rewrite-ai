The Emperor God’s sword light was shattered.</p><p>now, the real battle has only just begun!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘eyes revealed a strong desire to fight, as well as a fierce look.</p><p>The scales that had fallen off his body and the bloody wounds on his body that had been injured by the sword Qi were healing at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>A fierce and powerful aura was constantly emitted from the nine Dragons. Slowly, their momentum actually suppressed the Emperor God.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword ringing resounded throughout the ancient city of Providence. A golden combat sword appeared above the Emperor God’s head.</p><p>As soon as the sword appeared, it attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>The Golden battle sword was filled with a noble aura. A Golden Dragon circled around the hilt, looking extremely majestic.</p><p>It was like the Emperor of swords, its might suppressing the universe.</p><p>The Emperor sword was a bloodline that could only be passed down by the direct descendants of Di Yi’s Martial Emperor bloodline.</p><p>This was the second time Lu Ming had seen the Emperor sword bloodline. He had seen it on di Feng and now on di Shen.</p><p>Back then, di Feng was only a level four divine level expert. However, the eight dazzling golden chakras of God Emperor made countless people’s eyes widen.</p><p>Divine level rank 8. Another divine level rank 8 bloodline had appeared.</p><p>Previously, it was fatty who entered empty space. Now, it was Emperor God.</p><p>“Nest, this guy’s bloodline is the same level as mine. How is this possible? I’m ten thousand times more handsome than this guy!”</p><p>The fatty shouted unhappily.</p><p>Only this guy could still call out. The others ‘eyes were very serious.</p><p>The Emperor God’s figure flashed and disappeared into the Emperor sword. The Emperor trembled, and the vast sword power burst out madly, pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his claws and broke the vast sword force.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats. They held their breath and stared at the fighting ring.</p><p>They knew that the final battle was about to begin.</p><p>It was beyond everyone’s expectations that this battle could reach this stage.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually broken through his cultivation in the middle of the battle. His combat strength had improved greatly and he had forced the Emperor God to perform the blood fusion!</p><p>This battle, who would win and who would lose, was beginning to be filled with suspense.</p><p>“World-slaying sword!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard from the Emperor sword. The Emperor sword shook and endless golden light was emitted. The golden light was actually sword Qi.</p><p>Endless sword Qi appeared around the Emperor sword like a pair of sword Qi wings.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the next moment, endless sword Qi shot toward the nine Dragons. Each sword Qi was extremely terrifying and covered every inch of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and stomped with their nine claws, performing the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>The void trembled and violent energy exploded, destroying all the sword Qi.</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies and pounced toward the Emperor sword in the air. The Emperor sword trembled and slashed at the nine Dragons with a terrifying sword intent.</p><p>A Dragon and a sword were fighting on the fighting ring.</p><p>The roar of the sword and the cry of the Dragon resounded through the world. On the fighting ring, the roar continued as the two began a fierce battle.</p><p>It was difficult to determine the winner. For a moment, the two were in a stalemate and fought for hundreds of moves.</p><p>More than 20 minutes had passed, and the winner had yet to be determined.</p><p>According to the rules, once the battle had been going on for 30 minutes and the victor had not been decided, the ancient city of Providence would automatically determine the winner as the person who had the upper hand.</p><p>But now, the two seemed to be tied.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and stared at the fighting ring. They didn’t even dare to breathe loudly for fear of disturbing the two people in the fighting ring.</p><p>Not to mention the younger generation, even the older generation, spirit gods, and even Supreme Masters had never seen such a battle in their thousands of years of life.</p><p>Each of these people had the potential to become a martial Royal realm expert in the future.</p><p>They were all rare existences that only appeared once in a hundred years or even a thousand years. If they appeared, they would be characters that could suppress an era.</p><p>It was too rare for two such people to appear in the same era.</p><p>A hundred years ago, Yan kuangtu had appeared out of nowhere. No one in the younger generation of the eastern barren territory could defeat him. He had swept away all the strong cultivators and reached the peak.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, when the Supreme nine suns appeared, it was the same. He was invincible.</p><p>However, this generation was different. There were so many geniuses and experts that they could even rival the Emperor gods.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. In the end, after an intense collision in the air, they both retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor sword trembled and actually collapsed, returning to its human form.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Was the Emperor God going to be defeated?</p><p>However, the nine Dragons ‘bodies glowed and dispersed immediately after, turning back into Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>The power of their bloodlines seemed to have been exhausted at the same time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to admit that you’re very strong. You’re the first person who has forced me to this extent. But this is it. It’s time to end this!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were filled with killing intent. A powerful aura suddenly burst out of his body, and golden flames spread out from his body.</p><p>The Emperor God’s aura became even more terrifying than before.</p><p>Intent realm, another kind of intent realm. This intent realm was very similar to the fire intent realm. It was called the Golden flame intent realm.</p><p>The Emperor God had comprehended three intents. It seemed that his golden flame intent had reached the fourth level and had successfully merged with the other two intents.</p><p>It was unbelievable that the Emperor God was still hiding his strength.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu, Bai Shijin, and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>They had never expected the Emperor God to have such a trick up his sleeve.</p><p>it seems that the Emperor God won in the end!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming is just a stepping stone for the Emperor God!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan snorted coldly.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the more unhappy he was.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I was planning to preserve some of my strength so that I could compete with the prodigies of the central continent and the other three regions in the future. Now, I’ll let you have a taste!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Emperor God turned into a golden sword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Emperor God’s heart was higher than the sky. His vision was no longer limited to the eastern barren territory. He wanted to compete with the paragons of the southern underworld, Northern Plains, Western Desert, and even the central continent. Thus, he had been holding back.</p><p>“Do you think I don’t have the means to do so?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was not panicking. Instead, he appeared very calm. There was even a hint of a smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Inscriptions appeared on his body, and a battle of inscriptions appeared.</p><p>All of them were support-type formations. Some increased speed, some increased defense, and some burst true energy …</p><p>There were more than ten arrays in total, causing Lu Ming’s aura to soar.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took a step forward. Countless inscriptions appeared on the entire fighting ring and even in the air. A huge array emerged.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually been secretly inscribing inscriptions during the previous battle. After more than twenty minutes of fighting, Lu Ming had inscribed a huge array.</p><p>This point had been hidden from everyone.</p><p>As Lu Ming had been using martial arts to fight his enemies, he had displayed unbelievably strong combat power in martial arts. This had caused everyone to overlook one thing-not only was Lu Ming a martial arts powerhouse, but his Dao of inscription was also not weak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
