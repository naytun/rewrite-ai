A true dragon formed above his head and roared.</p><p>460 feet.</p><p>This person was none other than ao tu from the sky demon Valley. His fate Dragon was 460 feet long, which was 60 feet longer than Blood Sword one. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, since he had come earlier, everyone already knew that the Emperor God might have obtained more fate value.</p><p>After ao tu came up, he turned around and looked at the stairs. A divine light flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>There was a rumbling sound coming from the stairs. Soon, a handsome face was revealed. It was the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God’s slow steps seemed to be extremely heavy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Finally, he took a step forward, and a true dragon formed above his head.</p><p>“560 feet, 560 feet long!”</p><p>God, no wonder the Emperor God is ranked first on the list of top 1000 talents. He’s a 250-meter-long Dragon of fate. He’s ranked first!</p><p>that’s right. It’s 150 meters long at the start. There’s a chance it’ll be 1000 meters long when the battle for karmic luck begins!</p><p>Cries of alarm came from the surroundings.</p><p>haha, congratulations, Your Majesty. The Emperor God really has the demeanor of His Majesty when he was young. Perhaps another martial Royal realm expert will be born in the Emperor heaven divine Palace during the holidays. Congratulations!</p><p>The master of the Wang family congratulated Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>that’s right. Brother Wang is right. Congratulations, Your Majesty!</p><p>The master of the Jiang family and the others also congratulated him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others exclaimed in a low voice. Their eyes were filled with grief.</p><p>Even the Emperor God had appeared. There should be no one else behind him. Could it be that Lu Ming had already died?</p><p>At this moment, even Yan kuangtu and the nine suns Supreme Master were swayed, and their eyes dimmed.</p><p>Lu Ming was still too weak compared to the top ten on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Could it be that this was the end?</p><p>However, they did not notice that the divine Emperor, ao tu, and Xue Jian Yi were still looking in the direction of the stairs.</p><p>The sovereigns also stared at the stairs without blinking, as if they could sense something.</p><p>At this time, the others also noticed something strange and looked at the stairs.</p><p>Could there be someone else?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>The divine Emperor, ao tu, and Xue Jianyi had all appeared. Could it be that there were still people who had not come up?</p><p>Impossible. Who could obtain more fate value than the Emperor God?</p><p>Unless someone had deliberately stayed at the top of the stairs and waited until the end to attract attention.</p><p>In history, there had been people like that.</p><p>However, everyone couldn’t help but be curious as they stared at it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A slight vibration could be heard.</p><p>There was really someone there.</p><p>The eyes of Bai Shijin, Yan kuangtu, and the others lit up. If there were still people, it meant that there was still hope.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sound of vibration kept coming. It was very soft at first, but slowly, it became louder and clearer.</p><p>In the end, it was as if there was an earthquake, and there was a violent roar.</p><p>Each explosion was like a mountain crashing into the ground.</p><p>Finally, a handsome face appeared in everyone’s sight.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The eyes of Bai Shijin, Yan kuangtu, and the others suddenly lit up, emitting a bright light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>it’s him! He’s the last one! How is this possible? ”</p><p>I guess he’s just pretending to be the last one. He didn’t get much fate value, so it’s impossible for him to get more than the Emperor God!</p><p>that’s for sure. It’s already not bad that he can transform his fate into a Dragon!</p><p>A wave of discussion spread out in the surroundings.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was trembling and he was panting heavily.</p><p>“Nest, why is it so heavy? this is too heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept cursing in his heart. He felt that he was carrying hundreds of mountains on his back while climbing the stairs. He was exhausted.</p><p>He was envious of others who were as light as swallows.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Finally, he took a step into the fighting ring and the entire fighting ring rumbled violently. When Lu Ming stepped into the fighting ring, all the pressure on him disappeared without a trace.</p><p>At the same time, the Book of Destiny appeared and crumbled. A Dragon of destiny appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rumbled as a mighty true dragon spiraled up in the air.</p><p>More importantly, this true dragon was 800 feet long.</p><p>Yes, 800 feet!</p><p>The scene was silent. Everyone was stunned as they looked at the young man on the fighting ring and the true dragon that was 800 feet long.</p><p>Eight hundred feet, how was this possible?</p><p>How could Lu Ming have such terrifying luck?</p><p>Even Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the Supreme martial artists of the other major forces were stunned.</p><p>“Eight hundred feet? how is that possible? Lu Ming, this little b * stard, how could he have such a high amount of luck? how is this possible?”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan was the first to cry out in disbelief.</p><p>He was a Supreme martial artist of his generation. He had always been calm and composed. No matter what major event he faced, his expression would not change. However, this matter was simply too shocking. He couldn’t help but exclaim in shock.</p><p>“Could it be that he’s already become so powerful in the battle of karmic luck? The amount of fate energy I obtained is 800 feet!”</p><p>The master of the Jiang family was also shocked.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, good job. I knew that this kid could do it!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed after being stunned for a while.</p><p>The eyes of the nine suns Paragon also lit up with joy.</p><p>As for Bai Shijin, du songjue and the other higher-ups of the talisman Amulet sect, they were even more surprised.</p><p>This was beyond their expectations.</p><p>Although they had offered Lu Ming the first place in the battle of Providence, they knew very well that the offer was too high. They had deliberately raised the offer to put pressure on Lu Ming.</p><p>In their hearts, it was fine as long as Lu Ming could get into the top ten.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would really come in first.</p><p>Even though there was still a battle for Providence later.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had become the focus of the audience. Everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Above his head, the 800-foot true dragon of fate roared and looked down at the other Dragons of fate, flood Dragons of fate, and giant pythons.</p><p>Even the Emperor God’s true Dragon of Fortune was much shorter than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Hmph, we only managed to attract the enemy’s experts in the end, and then attacked them with a treasure. That’s all. All this luck will eventually belong to me. I’ll make you spit it all out!</p><p>The Emperor God said coldly.</p><p>that’s right. You’re a guy who hides in the dark and takes advantage of others. You only rely on treasures to catch them off guard. If you rely on your real abilities, can you obtain so many luck points? ”</p><p>Demonic Lord Luo Tian also sneered and spoke with disdain.</p><p>They all thought that Lu Ming had so many luck points because he had obtained the totem pole in the end.</p><p>The last totem pillar was the last one and the most crucial one. They believed that the last totem pillar would definitely be able to obtain a huge amount of fate value.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
