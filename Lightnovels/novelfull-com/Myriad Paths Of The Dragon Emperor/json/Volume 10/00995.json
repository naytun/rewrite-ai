Who helped me?”</p><p>...</p><p>He knew very well that the poisonous Rainbow snake’s poison was difficult to detoxify. He thought that it was impossible for him to wake up, so he was quite surprised.</p><p>it’s big brother Lu! Big brother Lu helped you!</p><p>A ‘an looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>Xiao Zhan also looked at Lu Ming. When he saw that Lu Ming was so young, he was also slightly stunned.</p><p>He was so young. Could he be a powerful Alchemist?</p><p>“Junior Lu Shaoqing greets senior Xiao!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists slightly.</p><p>“There’s no need to be so polite, young hero. You saved my life, so I should be bowing to you!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan struggled and wanted to bow to Lu Ming, but he was too weak to even lift his hand.</p><p>“Senior, you don’t have to be so polite. I’m friends with ah Luo and ah Lei. It’s my duty to help. Senior, your body is weak now. You should rest well!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Hongyun’s expression changed. Then, he suddenly revealed a surprised smile and stepped forward. father, father, you’re awake! That’s great! I’ve been worried about you day and night, and I can’t sleep at night!</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan looked at Xiao Hongyun and nodded slightly.</p><p>A dark look flashed in the depths of Xiao Hongyun’s eyes, but he still had a smile on his face. father, you’ve just been poisoned and your body is weak. You should rest well. We won’t disturb you any longer. I’ll order someone to send you some elixirs to replenish your essence and Qi!</p><p>Then, he looked at the sisters and said,”Ah Zhen, ah Lei, let’s go out. Don’t disturb grandpa’s rest!”</p><p>Grandpa, have a good rest. We’ll be leaving first!</p><p>A-Qing said with some reluctance.</p><p>you can go now, young hero Lu. I’ll thank you in person after I’ve recovered!</p><p>Xiao Zhan said.</p><p>“Senior is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and everyone left the room.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, right? I have something to tell you!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s face turned cold as soon as he left the room.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The group left the main residence and went to a courtyard outside.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, since my father’s poison has been cured and you’ve recovered, there’s no need to stay in the Xiao family any longer. Please leave!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s first sentence was to ask him to leave.</p><p>The sisters ‘eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“Second uncle, what do you mean by this? Big brother Lu has just cured grandpa’s poison and you’re already chasing him away. He’s the benefactor of our Xiao family, is this how you treat our benefactor?”</p><p>A ‘an said in disbelief.</p><p>“What do you know at such a young age? Do you really think he’s sincerely helping father detoxify? He must have a purpose for doing this.”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun chided him and then looked at Lu Ming. Lu Shaoqing, you’re after the two girls, aren’t you? the two girls of the Xiao family are indeed outstanding beauties. You approached them on purpose and even helped my father detoxify his poison. Your goal is nothing more than to gain the favor of these two girls. You’re killing two birds with one stone. These two girls are not very experienced in the world. You can hide it from them, but how can you hide it from me? ”</p><p>let me tell you, these two girls are already Ling yunkong’s men from the floating mountain. You’d better give up on them. Otherwise, you won’t even know how you’ll die. So, leave the Xiao family now!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun looked at Lu Ming coldly, his tone gradually becoming more serious.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>This matter was truly too laughable.</p><p>He had come to the Xiao family because ah Zhen and her sister had invited him. He was just looking for a place to heal his injuries and help Xiao Zhan detoxify.</p><p>He had originally planned to leave after curing Xiao Zhan of his poison.</p><p>But now, in Xiao Hongyun’s eyes, he had actually become a person with ulterior motives. His goal was actually to obtain the Xiao sisters. How ridiculous was this?</p><p>The Xiao family was indebted to him now, and it was fine if Xiao Hongyun didn’t thank him, but he immediately asked him to leave.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Since they didn’t welcome him, there was no need for him to stay.</p><p>big brother Lu, don’t listen to second uncle’s nonsense. You saved Grandpa, and Grandpa said he would be grateful to you!</p><p>A-Qing said anxiously.</p><p>Ah Lei’s eyes were also filled with anxiety.</p><p>“What nonsense? You two little girls don’t know what’s important and what’s not. You’re Ling yunkong’s people now, but you’re so close to this brat. What would he think if he knew about this? Do you want to put the Xiao family in danger? Do you want the Xiao family to be destroyed?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun shouted.</p><p>“You … You’re talking nonsense. When did we become Ling yunkong’s people? It’s all your own wishful thinking!”</p><p>A-Qing retorted loudly.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s face turned even gloomier. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Why aren’t you leaving? don’t tell me you want to stay here?”</p><p>kid, you cured my grandfather’s poison. This middle-grade intent crystal will be your reward. Take it and get lost!</p><p>Desolate ning waved his hand and a middle-grade profound meaning crystal flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed as he smashed the ultimacy crystal into pieces. He cast a cold glance at Xiao ning and Xiao Hongyun before he looked at ah Luo and her sister.”Ah Zhen, ah Lei, thank you for your hospitality these days. Goodbye!”</p><p>With that, his figure moved, turning into a rainbow light and soaring into the sky, leaving the Xiao family.</p><p>“Big brother Lu!”</p><p>A-Qing called out, then glared at Xiao Hongyun and his son with hatred and said, ” “This is how the Xiao family treats their benefactors. I’m afraid that they will become a joke if this news is spread out. Also, even if we die, we will not go to the floating mountain to see Ling yunkong. You can give up on this idea. Ah Lei, let’s go!”</p><p>A-Qing pulled a-Lei and ran out of the Xiao family.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way and flew hundreds of miles in a flash. He came to a Street North of Lishui City and chose a restaurant. He chose some side dishes and started eating.</p><p>With his current state of mind, he naturally wouldn’t be in a bad mood because of Xiao Hongyun and the others. The Xiao family had nothing to do with him. He was just passing by an Inn. The only people he was a little worried about were ah Zhen and her sister.</p><p>The two young girls were very innocent, and they would probably be used as tools for Xiao Hongyun and his son to advance.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Boy, you can’t let go of those two girls?”</p><p>No one knew when dandan appeared on the table, but she was gnawing on a chicken leg.</p><p>After a few days, dandan’s injuries had basically recovered.</p><p>that’s right. I’m indeed a little worried. I plan to cultivate near Lishui City for a while. If you have time, help me keep an eye on it!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Sure, but I can’t be left out of the spirit herbs!”</p><p>Dandan ate until her mouth was full of oil, and in a moment, a big chicken leg was gnawed clean by dandan.</p><p>After eating and drinking to his heart’s content, Lu Ming found an Inn nearby and checked in.</p><p>In a room of the Xiao family, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning were discussing something.</p><p>damn it! I didn’t expect that Lu Shaoqing could really cure the old man’s poison!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s expression was dark.</p><p>“Father, what should we do now? When that old man wakes up, he will definitely object to us giving those two girls to Ling yunkong.”</p><p>Desolate ning said anxiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
