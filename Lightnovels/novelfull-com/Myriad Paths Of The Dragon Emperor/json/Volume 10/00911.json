In fact, there was even a flash of killing intent.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>For some reason, Jiang Taichong’s heart suddenly jumped. He had an inexplicable sense of crisis, but he could not figure out where the sense of crisis came from.</p><p>Lu Ming? Impossible. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was not their match at all.</p><p>Wang Yan was already closing in.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a heavy step forward. Dense inscriptions appeared on the ground and a few large arrays appeared.</p><p>“You want to deal with us by instantly setting up a formation? dream on!”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed coldly, but in the next moment, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>“No, this is a level Seven formation technique. How could you inscribe a level Seven formation technique in an instant?”</p><p>Wang Yan cried out in disbelief.</p><p>An ordinary rank-seven Alchemist could not inscribe a rank-seven formation in an instant. Only a rank-seven Alchemist with profound spiritual power could do it.</p><p>How could Lu Ming do it?</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to retreat.</p><p>However, it was already too late. The formation glowed, and golden vines condensed and wrapped around Jiang Taichong and Wang Yan.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>An extremely sharp aura emanated from Jiang Taichong’s body. With a wave of his hand, sharp sword Qi burst out and cut at the vines.</p><p>However, he was only able to cut off a few vines. These vines were called golden vines and were formed by a level Seven primary formation technique. They were extremely tough and were impervious to fire and water.</p><p>Wang Yan roared in anger as flames spread out in an attempt to incinerate the vines. Although he could do so, the speed was extremely slow.</p><p>The two of them were entangled for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and continued to inscribe the array. Countless inscriptions glowed on his feet and palms. Purple mental energy fire danced between his eyebrows.</p><p>a seventh-rank Alchemist! He’s a seventh-rank Alchemist! He has to get out!</p><p>Jiang Taichong roared in horror and attacked with all his might. The vines were cut off one by one.</p><p>A few golden vines array could not completely trap Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong, but Lu Ming’s purpose was to stop them for a while, and that was enough.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the ground, another formation appeared.</p><p>This time, it was a Level-7 intermediate array, the frost hunting array.</p><p>Formations were generally divided into elementary, intermediate, advanced, and peak.</p><p>For example, a level Seven primary array was sufficient to deal with martial artists of the first to third level of the spirit embryo realm. If used well, it could kill a third level spirit embryo realm martial artist.</p><p>However, although Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong were only at the first level of the spirit embryo realm, their combat strength was enough to kill a fourth level spirit embryo realm cultivator. An elementary level Seven formation technique was not of much use to them.</p><p>However, it was a different story for a grade-7 intermediate formation.</p><p>A middle grade level Seven formation technique was able to deal with experts at the fourth to sixth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming’s mental energy was extremely dense and far exceeded that of an inscriber of the same level, he had just broken through to Level Seven. It was still impossible for him to inscribe a level Seven intermediate array in an instant. He would need some time.</p><p>The time that the Golden Vine array had blocked Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong was enough for him to inscribe a level Seven middle array.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Twelve long Spears made of ice appeared, exuding an extremely cold aura. They pierced through the air and headed toward Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong respectively.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wang Yan punched out with both fists, and a terrifying flame spread out, trying to melt the ice spear. However, to his shock, the ice spear only shrank a little after piercing through the blazing fist force and continued on its way towards Wang Yan.</p><p>On the other hand, Jiang Taichong spared no effort to hack at the ice spear. Although he managed to block it in the end, it was still very difficult. A layer of white frost appeared on his body, and he trembled all over as if he was about to be frozen.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>To their despair, more ice spears were formed. This time, there were twenty-four of them.</p><p>Each of them had 12 roots, and they went for the kill.</p><p>The two of them tried their best to block, but the power of the ice spears was too terrifying. Although they managed to block it, they were both injured. But then, more ice spears appeared.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Following that, two desperate screams rang out. Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong’s bodies were pierced by a few ice spears respectively. Their bodies stiffened as they were frozen to the spot.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me!”</p><p>Wang Yan cried out in fear.</p><p>Although the battle of Providence was dangerous, it was full of opportunities. No one had participated in the battle of Providence, as they were all here to die. They all wanted to obtain great opportunities and boundless Providence.</p><p>Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong were naturally the same. They wanted to obtain a great opportunity in the battle of Providence, obtain great Providence, stand out from it, and surpass those stronger geniuses. How could they have thought that they were going to die less than a month after the battle of Providence had started? how could they be willing?</p><p>“Wang Yan, have you forgotten what I said? I said I will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the ice spear appeared and he struck again.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong screamed in fear and madness, but they could not change the outcome.</p><p>The ice spear pierced through the foreheads of the two.</p><p>Then, the bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. The devouring power burst out and devoured the two.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the refinement to be completed.</p><p>Jiang Taichong cultivated the sword concept, which was not of much use to Lu Ming. When the time came, Wang Yan’s fire concept would allow Lu Ming’s fire concept to break through and step into level three.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian did not improve.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was at divine level three, while the nine Dragons ‘bloodline was at divine level four.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>After refining it, Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief and stood up. The Book of Destiny appeared before his eyes.</p><p>He noticed that the Book of Destiny’s destiny had increased by 2000 points.</p><p>This was because after killing Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong, their own luck value had been taken away by Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s luck value was close to five thousand.</p><p>Then, he looked at the stone door.</p><p>He had to break this stone door.</p><p>Lu Ming began to inscribe the array in front of the stone door.</p><p>This time, he spent half a day to inscribe a level Seven advanced array.</p><p>Lu Ming could instantly cast a beginner level Seven array. However, if he was given enough time, he could even set up a top-notch Level Seven array.</p><p>The formation glowed, forming a giant hammer that smashed toward the stone door.</p><p>The hammer condensed by a level-seven advanced array was many times stronger than Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone door shook violently as if it was about to be broken.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>One by one, the giant hammers formed and smashed against the door.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds were endless.</p><p>After more than a dozen attacks, the door was broken open with a bang, revealing a dark passage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He waved his hand and a puppet walked in first.</p><p>Seeing that there was no danger, Lu Ming also stepped in.</p><p>After the passage, there was a huge underground secret room.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
