He actually took in such a disciple!</p><p>...</p><p>The demon Emperor’s soft voice sounded again.</p><p>The eyes of Martial Emperor Di Yi and the corpse Emperor flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>Even a Martial Emperor expert would be tempted by someone who could awaken an eighth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>“So what if you’re a level eight divine level expert? I’ll Still Kill you!”</p><p>Wang fentian launched a fearsome attack at the fatty.</p><p>Although the Fatty’s bloodline was of a high grade, his cultivation was slightly weaker. It seemed like he had just broken through to the sixth level spirit embryo realm not long ago.</p><p>However, fatty didn’t want to make any mistakes, so he focused on defense the entire time. In the end, he took out a huge shield and blocked Wang fentian’s flames.</p><p>Wang fentian continued to attack. The fatty shouted, but he couldn’t break through.</p><p>Time continued to pass. Suddenly, the eight battlefields trembled and the light shield shone. Everyone in the battlefields was teleported out.</p><p>An hour had passed.</p><p>“Haha, you want to deal with me? in your dreams!”</p><p>When the fatty realized that he had appeared on the grandstand, he laughed arrogantly and looked at Wang fentian provocatively.</p><p>Wang fentian’s eyes were about to spew fire.</p><p>fatty, you’ve actually awakened an eighth level divine rank bloodline. That’s amazing!</p><p>At the moment, there was a huge axe floating above the fat man’s head. The eight golden chakras were shining. Bai chixue’s eyes were wide open as she looked at the fat man in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming was also surprised. He did not expect that the Fatty’s third bloodline would be so terrifying. It was actually a level eight divine level.</p><p>It was no wonder that when they first met, fatty was so mysterious. He did not tell Lu Ming when Lu Ming asked him.</p><p>Countless pairs of eyes were looking at fatty. Some were shocked, some were envious, and some were jealous.</p><p>hahaha, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. This is talent. I can’t help it. I was born with it!</p><p>The fatty was extremely proud as he laughed out loud.</p><p>When he saw the way others looked at him, he felt extremely comfortable. He smiled so much that his eyes could not even open.</p><p>the heavens are really unfair. They actually allowed this damn fatty to awaken an eighth level divine rank bloodline!</p><p>Within the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, someone gritted his teeth in anger.</p><p>that’s right. What a waste. It’s like a fresh flower stuck in cow dung!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Fatty’s ears twitched a few times. When he heard these words, he was instantly displeased. He stared at these people with an unkind gaze and shouted, ” you’re the f * cking cow dung! You’re all trash! I’m just envious and jealous. I’m the son of the heavens, and I’m destined to sweep across the world and step on all of you!</p><p>“Damn it, this damn fatty, he’s really arrogant!”</p><p>Those people almost vomited blood.</p><p>Di Shen, Xue Jianyi, ao tu, and the others also looked at fatty with a serious look. Fatty’s cultivation was still slightly low, but once he grew up, he would be a great enemy.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, many people looked at Lu Ming and were dumbfounded.</p><p>The fate Dragon above Lu Ming’s head was too big and too long. It was a hundred or so feet. It was too shocking.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming would have been killed by Luo Tian or the sky demon Valley’s prodigies in the eighth battlefield. They did not expect him to be alive. Furthermore, the length of the fate Dragon had become even more terrifying.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming has killed Luo Tian!”</p><p>When they found out the truth, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually kill Luo Tian? How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so strong?</p><p>Before the battle for the light from Providence started, some of them thought that Luo Tian and the rest were lucky to be assigned to the same battlefield as Lu Ming. At this moment, their faces were pale and their backs were drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>This wasn’t just good luck, it was bad luck. If they had been assigned to the eighth battlefield, they might have ended up like Luo Tian.</p><p>They knew that they had underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>The Emperor God and the others looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>At this time, the eight battlefields on the fighting ring had all disappeared and returned to the fighting ring. At the same time, eight rays of light fell on the eight people.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, di Shen, ao tu, Blood Sword one, corpse warrior, Feng Xuan, Dongfang Yu, and Wang fentian.</p><p>Eight people meant that they were the eight people with the highest luck value in the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only talisman sect member.</p><p>There were three people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, with the most people. They were the God Emperor, Dongfang Yu, and Wang fentian.</p><p>The two people from the sky corpse sect, Blood Sword one and corpse battle.</p><p>The two from the heavenly demon Valley were ao tu and Feng Xuan.</p><p>Feng Xuan was an extremely beautiful woman, a peerless genius of the sky demon Valley, with the Phoenix bloodline in her body.</p><p>Next, the eight paragons would compete in pairs to fight for each other’s luck.</p><p>The rules were the same as before. If you were defeated, half of your fate would be taken away. If you admitted defeat, 90% of your fate would be taken away. If you were killed, all your fate would belong to your opponent.</p><p>Next would be the final battle of the battle of Providence, as well as the most pinnacle battles. Each of them was an extremely powerful existence.</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming was one of the dark horses.</p><p>There was another Dark Horse, Feng Xuan of the sky demon Valley. Both of them were new talents.</p><p>The others were all heaven’s favorites who were famous in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Ao tu was a heaven’s favorite who was thought to be able to compete with gods and emperors. Some people thought that ao tu was even stronger than Xue Jianyi, who was ranked second on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>The Emperor God ranked first on the list of top 1000 talents, and most people thought he was the top genius among the younger generation in the East barren.</p><p>Dongfang Yu, third on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Corpse warrior was ranked fourth on the list of top 1000 talents, while Wang fentian was ranked fifth.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to the next battle. After this battle, the list of top 1000 talents would be rearranged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Six of the eight beams of light had disappeared, leaving only two behind.</p><p>One of them enveloped Lu Ming while the other enveloped Wang fentian.</p><p>The first battle was actually between Lu Ming and Wang fentian.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the two of them.</p><p>Wang fentian looked at Lu Ming with a strong killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>“Fen Tian, are you confident?”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan asked.</p><p>“His luck is mine!”</p><p>Wang fentian licked his lips and revealed a greedy look. He moved and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you can’t win, you can just admit defeat!”</p><p>Du songjue warned in a low voice.</p><p>“Haha, I believe that Lu Ming will definitely win!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>fatty, you were burned by this guy just now. I’ll take revenge for you now!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, took a step forward, and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Above their heads, there was a true dragon of luck.</p><p>Right now, Wang fentian’s true dragon of Providence was at least 500 feet long. However, in front of Lu Ming’s true dragon of Providence, he was like a tiny dot, being looked down upon by Lu Ming’s true dragon of Providence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to thank you for obtaining so much fate because it’s all going to be mine later!”</p><p>The greed in Wang fentian’s eyes intensified.</p><p>you’re very confident. Luo Tian was just as confident before, but I killed him in the end!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed with a contemptuous look.</p><p>Hmph, don’t compare me to Luo Tian. I can kill him if I fight him with all my strength!</p><p>Wang fentian said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? Was it? Then should we set up a life-and-death battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, but his words shocked everyone at the scene.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
