So many people had witnessed it, but in the end, Lu Ming had saved all the talisman sect disciples. They could not even stop Lu Ming himself. If word of this got out, they would be embarrassed.</p><p>...</p><p>since the paths of life and death here are constantly changing, let’s try them one by one. There are only nine regions in total anyway!</p><p>Brother Litian said coldly.</p><p>yes, that’s the only way. You go to the flame area, you go to the ice area …</p><p>Immediately, Blood Sword 17 began to give orders to the men of sacrifice.</p><p>The nine regions were constantly changing. That was easy to handle. As long as nine men of sacrifice stepped into the nine regions at the same time, they would naturally know which region was the path of survival.</p><p>The nine men of sacrifice stepped into the nine regions at the same time without hesitation. Eight of them died immediately, leaving only one man alive in the black fog. He disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“There’s a way out, charge!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord and the others all rushed into the black mist and disappeared.</p><p>…..</p><p>After Lu Ming stepped into the poisonous zone, he appeared in front of a Palace in the next moment.</p><p>There was no one in sight.</p><p>The talisman sect’s disciples who had entered earlier, as well as the disciples from the other factions, did not see them either.</p><p>it seems that the formation was randomly teleported to any corner of the palace!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>“I hope that Chi Xue and the others don’t run into the little demon Lord and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that the array would not be able to stop the little demon Lord and the rest. He only needed to send nine people to try.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sized up his surroundings.</p><p>There were palaces everywhere, and between the palaces, there were some small alleys.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming walked into the palace in front of him. There was nothing in the palace. It was empty.</p><p>Shaking his head, Lu Ming walked along a small alley toward the other palaces.</p><p>However, after walking for a while, he frowned. He realized that he had stepped into an array.</p><p>This formation was like a maze, because after walking in his alley for a while, he returned to the original place.</p><p>There was also a formation in the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>It was good to have an array formation. It was an advantage for the talisman sect’s disciples. Even if they encountered the little demonic Lord and the others, they might have a chance to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately observed his surroundings carefully.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile. He took mysterious steps and walked forward. Half an hour later, he had walked out of the maze.</p><p>In front of him, a huge Palace appeared.</p><p>The palace gate was tightly shut.</p><p>Lu Ming went forward and pushed the door open. He walked in.</p><p>The palace was empty, but there was a stone door in the innermost part.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the stone door.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, sharp air-piercing sounds were heard from both sides. Two rays of Saber Light were slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and dodged backward, avoiding the two saber lights. However, the two saber lights continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>“A puppet!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that it was two puppets that were attacking him.</p><p>The two puppets were in human form. Their bodies had a metallic luster and their eyes were golden. They were filled with a cold and emotionless aura. Each of them held a big knife in their hands and they slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique. Four types of concepts swirled around his palms as he struck out twice.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the two puppets were forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s equivalent to the peak of the third level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The two puppets were pushed back by Lu Ming. They stomped their feet and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming dodged and struck out two more palms.</p><p>The two palms directly hit the two puppets, and the two puppets were smashed into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and walked towards the stone door. No puppet came out to stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the stone door open. There was a stone room in front of him. There was another stone door in front of the stone room.</p><p>However, as soon as Lu Ming stepped into the stone chamber, two more puppets appeared and charged at him.</p><p>This time, the strength of the two puppets had reached the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>It was still easily dealt with by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and pushed the stone door open. Behind the stone door was another stone room, and in front of the stone room was another stone door.</p><p>This time, a total of nine fourth level spirit embryo realm puppets appeared.</p><p>“What’s in front of us? These trials are like tests, I’d like to go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind raced as he launched an attack. In a short while, the nine puppets were scattered by him.</p><p>Sure enough, there were stone rooms below, and there were puppets in each room, and they were getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>When Lu Ming reached the ninth stone chamber, the puppet that appeared had already reached the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>However, they could not stop Lu Ming and they were defeated by him one by one.</p><p>After the ninth stone chamber, there were no more stone chambers. Instead, there was a passage. On both sides of the passage, there were metal puppets standing motionless with sabers in their hands.</p><p>“Nest, also, what level of strength do the puppets here have? They can’t all be at the seventh level spirit embryo realm, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>He slowly walked forward.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>All of a sudden, one of the puppets moved. Its cold, metallic eyes glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, the saber in his hand exuding a sharp light, and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with five streams of dragon energy and threw a punch at the puppet.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a dull thud, the puppet and Lu Ming were forced to take six or seven steps back.</p><p>WOWO, this is definitely a puppet at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm. What powerful strength!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>“You’re pretty strong to be able to force me back!”</p><p>At this moment, the puppet suddenly spoke. However, its voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p>“What’s inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s a precious treasure inside. There will be tests along the way. Our strength will be adjusted according to the strength of the people who enter. The stronger the cultivation, the stronger we will be. Only if you pass the test will you be able to obtain the precious treasure inside!</p><p>The puppet spoke, similarly emotionless.</p><p>“There are so many puppets equivalent to the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm. How can I defeat them all? Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at both sides of the passage. There were more than a hundred puppets in total. He was speechless.</p><p>With his current combat strength, how was it possible for him to defeat hundreds of puppets at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm?</p><p>If he were to burst out with his Strongest Battle strength and circulate the prison suppressing heavenly art to its strongest, it was still possible to defeat two or three of them. However, after that, he would run out of true Qi and would no longer be able to fight.</p><p>This test was too difficult. He was only at the second level of the spirit embryo realm, and the puppet that appeared was actually at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, which was five levels higher than him. How many people could complete it?</p><p>“There’s no need for you to defeat all of us. You just need to pass through this passage!”</p><p>The puppet spoke again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
