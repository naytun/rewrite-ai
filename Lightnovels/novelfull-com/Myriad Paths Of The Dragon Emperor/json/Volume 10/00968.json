It was you and those old fogeys who besieged me back then. I should be the one to hold you accountable. Do I need you to not hold you accountable? What a joke!”</p><p>A faint voice filled with contempt reverberated throughout the entire area, causing some people to be dumbfounded.</p><p>Contempt. This was blatant contempt. Lu Ming was looking down on a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>The Wang family head said that he would not pursue the matter with Lu Ming, but Lu Ming’s meaning was clear. Did he need the Wang family head to not pursue the matter? The one who should be held accountable was him, Lu Ming.</p><p>What a big tone, what great confidence.</p><p>However, at this moment, no one felt that Lu Ming was arrogant.</p><p>Even Wang fentian had been defeated by Lu Ming. He had the right to be arrogant. In the future, there was a high possibility that he would strive for the Supreme-being position. By then, why would he need to fear the Wang family head?</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan’s face was completely red.</p><p>He was extremely angry.</p><p>How many years had it been? Ever since he had stepped into the position of a Supreme martial artist, no one had dared to speak to him in such a manner for many years. No one had dared to look down on him.</p><p>Even the other Supreme martial artists would be polite to him. But now, he was being looked down upon by a young man in his twenties. This was an insult to him.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed back into his human form. He sneered and said,”Old man, let’s take a step back. You said that you won’t pursue this matter, but can you represent the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Then, he looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>The Wang family master and the others also looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>That’s right, the Wang family master did not have the final say in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. It was Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>At this moment, Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes shot out two cold rays of light as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi with a hint of provocation in his eyes.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Lu Ming was so audacious that he dared to look at Martial Emperor Di Yi in the eye.</p><p>However, Martial Emperor Di Yi didn’t say a word. The light in his eyes disappeared, and he regained his calm.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family had an ugly expression on his face, and Wang fentian was filled with despair.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s attitude explained everything.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming moved. His body was like lightning as he charged toward Wang fentian.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Wang fentian roared and tried his best to resist.</p><p>However, he was severely injured and did not have much energy left. How could he be Lu Ming’s match?</p><p>In just a few moves, his bones and tendons were broken, and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood, falling to the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring and a long spear appeared in his hand. He walked toward Wang fentian, his cold killing intent covering Wang fentian’s entire body.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me, I don’t want to die!” He shouted.</p><p>run! Wang fentian roared as he twisted his body in an attempt to escape. His eyes were filled with endless fear.</p><p>In his life, he had killed countless people and slaughtered countless heaven’s chosen. But now that he was about to die at the hands of another heaven’s chosen, he was so terrified.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the spear pierced through Wang fentian’s heart. The powerful Qi burst out and crushed Wang fentian’s heart.</p><p>“Old ancestor, avenge me!”</p><p>Wang fentian let out an unwilling roar before his life was extinguished.</p><p>A proud Son of Heaven had been killed by Lu Ming here.</p><p>Everyone sighed in their hearts. If such a heaven’s favorite didn’t die, he would definitely be a figure who would dominate the eastern barren territory in the future. It would be no problem for him to become a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were countless heaven’s favorites in the world, but how many of them could grow up?</p><p>A dead heaven’s favorite was destined to be a stepping stone for others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family roared and exploded with cold killing intent.</p><p>His eyes were red, and his heart was bleeding.</p><p>This time, the Wang clan had suffered too heavy a loss.</p><p>The Wang family had four heaven’s favorites in the top 100.</p><p>However, two of them had already died before.</p><p>Now, even the most talented Wang fentian was dead. There was only one person left in the Wang family.</p><p>Originally, the Wang clan had four geniuses in the top 100 of the list of top 1000 talents in a generation. How glorious was that? it was as though they wanted to see the Wang clan rise up rapidly and even surpass the other five ancient aristocratic families, becoming the leader of the ancient aristocratic families in the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>However, everything was in vain now. His hatred for Lu Ming could not be washed away even if he used all the water in the world.</p><p>“Old man, this is what I wanted to say as well. This is only a small interest. In the future, I will personally take your dog head. Oh, I forgot to tell you, that Wang Yan and Wang Chen were also killed by me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, a cold smile hanging on his face.</p><p>“You … You deserve to die!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family roared in anger.</p><p>Originally, as a Supreme martial artist who had lived for thousands of years, he had a firm mind and had seen many storms. He would not be so easily angered.</p><p>However, he could not remain calm when facing Lu Ming.</p><p>In the battle of ninedragons, he was almost beaten to death by Lu Ming. Now, many of the Wang family’s geniuses had died at Lu Ming’s hands. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>If it was not for the fact that his cultivation was completely suppressed in the ancient city of Providence, he would have crushed Lu Ming’s bones and scattered his ashes.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths before he slowly calmed down.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s fate Dragon had devoured Wang fentian’s fate Dragon. Lu Ming’s fate Dragon had grown to 500 feet and was now close to 2000 feet.</p><p>At the same time, the devouring power burst forth and turned Wang fentian into a dried corpse. He kept his storage ring and kicked him off the fighting ring. This made the Wang clan leader so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and returned to the stands.</p><p>haha, you’re amazing, Lu Ming. You’ve avenged me. That Wang fentian looked so arrogant, but he dared to burn me with fire. He’s a dead dog now!</p><p>The fatty laughed out loud. He was so excited that his mouth cracked open.</p><p>also, Lu Ming, did you see that the old man from the Wang family was so angry that his face was the color of a pig’s liver and smoke was coming out of his head. It was really exciting!</p><p>Fatty continued to laugh. He didn’t lower his voice at all, and it spread to the entire area.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family, who had calmed down with great difficulty, suddenly became furious again, and his whole body trembled with anger.</p><p>The juniors deserved to die. He roared in his heart.</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a few sips of wine and laughed even more heartily.</p><p>The others were speechless. These people were simply lawless and didn’t know how to write fear.</p><p>The battle continued, and two more pillars of light landed on two more figures.</p><p>Ao tu of the heavenly demon Valley and Dongfang Yu of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with a shocking light.</p><p>It was another highlight.</p><p>Dongfang Yu was ranked third on the list of top 1000 talents, while ao tu was said to be able to compete with divine emperors. The battle between the two would definitely be exciting.</p><p>The two figures landed on the fighting ring. Without saying anything, the battle immediately broke out.</p><p>Dongfang Yu was incomparably powerful. He had cultivated two kinds of deity level cultivation techniques and his cultivation was also at the early stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. His bloodline was the same as Wang fentian’s, a seventh level deity bloodline.</p><p>Dongfang Yu’s overall strength was even slightly stronger than Wang fentian’s.</p><p>However, ao tu was even stronger. Ao tu had more than 70% of a true dragon’s bloodline, almost 80%. He had transformed into a flood Dragon and was fighting Dongfang Yu like a real Dragon.</p><p>The two of them fought for more than 50 moves. In the end, Dong Fang Yu was defeated and admitted defeat. She had lost 90% of her luck.</p><p>Meanwhile, ao tu’s fate energy rose greatly, and the length of his fate Dragon broke through 300 meters.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
