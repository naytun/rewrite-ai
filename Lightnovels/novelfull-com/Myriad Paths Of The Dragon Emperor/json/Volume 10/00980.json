Ten times!”</p><p>Dandan directly jumped up from Lu Ming’s shoulder, her face full of shock.</p><p>nest, I’m so envious. It actually increased tenfold all of a sudden. This means that you will be able to comprehend anything ten times faster in the future. I’m so envious!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Is ten times that much?” Lu Ming said. He had the path-understanding ancient tree. With the help of the path-understanding ancient tree, the speed at which he comprehended concepts was more than ten times faster.</p><p>“Kid, what do you know? This is your own comprehension ability and the improvement of your Foundation. How can the path-understanding ancient tree compare to it!”</p><p>let me tell you, in the short term, you have the path-understanding ancient tree and even the devouring talent of the nine Dragons, but it doesn’t seem to be of much use to the improvement of comprehension. But when your realm is higher, you will know how much use it is.</p><p>Dandan began to ramble on.</p><p>the path-understanding ancient tree has its limits. Its principle is to be in harmony with heaven and earth. It can emit the aura of the great path. At a lower level, the effect is naturally good, but there is a limit. When your cultivation reaches a certain level, the things you need to comprehend are many times higher than the intent realm of heaven and earth. The effect of the path-understanding ancient tree will be small.</p><p>“The nine Dragons” devouring talent is even more so. You should be able to devour other people’s intent runes and improve your intent, right? However, level four is the limit of the will of heaven and earth. The next step is the domain of the martial Royal realm, which is not a will rune. It has no physical body, so the nine Dragons ‘devouring talent can’t devour it at all. If you want to improve it, you have to comprehend it yourself.”</p><p>now, do you know how precious it is to improve your comprehension? ”</p><p>After saying that, dandan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself that the nine Dragons ‘devouring talent was not omnipotent.</p><p>After becoming a Martial Emperor, one’s intent could be transformed into a domain, and it could not be improved by devouring. One had to comprehend it on their own.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood how precious it was to improve his comprehension. This was a talent that would follow him for a lifetime.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re more in tune with this world now. If you break through to the rank of a Martial Emperor one day, it’ll be easier for you to cultivate than others. This is your advantage!</p><p>Dandan said again.</p><p>“Above Martial Emperor?”</p><p>There was a look of anticipation in Lu Ming’s eyes, but he then shook his head.</p><p>That realm was too far away from him.</p><p>What he had to do now was to take it one step at a time and break through to the spiritual God Realm as soon as possible.</p><p>Only those at the spiritual God Realm could be considered as the top experts in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>At this moment, the news that Lu Ming had won first place in the battle of Providence had spread throughout the entire Mount Liangyi. The entire Mount Liangyi was in shock and ecstasy.</p><p>After so many years, someone from the talisman sect had finally won first place in the battle of Providence and obtained great Providence.</p><p>Many people remembered that there was a rainbow light from the sky above Mount Liangyi. Some light scattered, which might be the result of the descent of fate.</p><p>Some of them were even inspired by the good fortune and broke through to the next realm. They were extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name once again shocked Mount Liangyi. Then, at a terrifying speed, it spread to the entire Eastern wilderness and covered it.</p><p>Time flew by and two days passed.</p><p>One day, fatty and ruan Tingting went to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, master came to look for us. He said he’ll take us to cultivate. We’re leaving!”</p><p>The fatty bade farewell to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fatty, this is a good thing. Help me thank senior mo Tian!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“AI! “Lu Ming, I wanted to stay and help you deal with the Emperor sky divine Palace, but my master, that old man, is very unyielding this time. He wants me to go with him. Hmph, I knew it. That old man is afraid of Di Yi. When he saw Di Yi’s original body, he didn’t dare to say anything!”</p><p>Fatty said unhappily.</p><p>fatty, don’t worry. This is Mount Liangyi. With the yin-yang sky formation, Di Yi can’t enter. Practice well. Don’t be completely crushed by me next time!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Don’t worry, the next time we meet, I’ll definitely catch up to you!”</p><p>The fatty grinned.</p><p>“Fatty, take this opportunity. Tingting is a good girl, don’t let her run away!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the fatty.</p><p>The fatty blushed and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, ” “Don’t worry, what kind of person am I? How can the woman I like escape from my grasp? the next time I see you, I’ll definitely make you my uncle!”</p><p>“Hey, damn fatty, what are you guys secretly talking about?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting glared at fatty with hostility.</p><p>“No, nothing much?”</p><p>The fat man’s expression changed and he shook his head.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re leaving. Take care!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting bade Lu Ming farewell.</p><p>“Take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Then, fatty and ruan Tingting turned around and left.</p><p>……</p><p>A day later, Bai Shijin, du songjue and the other elders of the talisman Amulet sect informed the Liangyi mountain of the talisman Amulet sect that Lu Ming was to be the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>He was an official zongzi, not a zongzi candidate. He would be in charge of the talisman Amulet sect in the future.</p><p>This time, no one objected.</p><p>Even Huan Zhen, Wen zongzi and the other zongzi candidates stood out to support Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had won first place in the battle of Providence, accumulating great fortune for the talisman Amulet sect. Moreover, the news that Lu Ming was the successor of Emperor Liao Cang had already spread. It was perfectly justifiable for Lu Ming to be promoted to a zongzi. No one else was more suitable than him.</p><p>There were many people who were blessed with good luck and benefited from it. They were grateful to Lu Ming and supported him.</p><p>Lu Ming had become the zongzi of the talisman sect.</p><p>……</p><p>In the center of ninedragons, where the Dragon veins of the nine Dragons converged, Martial Emperor Di Yi sat at the head of a huge Hall. More than a dozen people stood below him, including the Masters of the six ancient families.</p><p>Apart from the six great ancient families, the other people all had powerful auras, as deep as the ocean, and unfathomable. They were all Supreme-level figures.</p><p>the talisman Amulet sect will be destroyed. Six great aristocratic families, Di Tian Imperial Guards, immediately gather your men and attack the talisman Amulet sect!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi gave the order.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>All the Supreme martial artists acknowledged the order in unison.</p><p>“This time, I will personally lead the troops!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s voice was heard.</p><p>……</p><p>In the residence of Hua Chi and the others on Mount Liangyi, Lu Ming, Hua Chi, and pang Shi sat at a table, drinking and chatting. It was as if they had returned to the days when they had cultivated together in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The three of them had not had a drink together for many years.</p><p>Back in the mystical sword sect, Lu Ming was only fifteen years old. Now, he was already twenty-three years old.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, eight years had passed.</p><p>The three of them were no longer young and inexperienced youths. They had already entered the age of youth.</p><p>Right now, pang Shi’s body was extremely burly and muscular. He was more than two meters tall, and his aura was wild. His cultivation had already reached the half-step King realm, and he was only one step away from the king realm.</p><p>This level of cultivation was already considered top-tier in the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Hua Chi was busy with political affairs and had a slightly weaker cultivation. He was at the 9th level of Wu Zong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
