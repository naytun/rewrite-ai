Some of the important cities had the shadow of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace’s experts.</p><p>In particular, there were more experts from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the dozen or so large regions near the chaotic territory.</p><p>it seems that Martial Emperor Di Yi has indeed taken precautions. He is afraid that I will teleport out of the talisman Amulet sect and head to the central continent!</p><p>A black-robed young man was flying in the sky above a forest.</p><p>The black-robed young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>After he was teleported out of the talisman Amulet sect, he appeared in an underground cave. That underground cave was the teleportation array that the talisman Amulet sect had secretly built.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the aura-concealing talisman that he had prepared earlier and stuck it on his body to conceal his aura. He had no choice. Now that the mental energy fire had been transferred to his second body, even if he understood the principle and technique, he could not inscribe any inscriptions at all.</p><p>Then, he changed his appearance and changed his clothes before he left the underground cave and flew toward the chaotic domain.</p><p>Of course, dandan was with him, but she had been staying in the mountain and river diagram all this time, gnawing on spiritual medicine and sleeping, euphemistically calling it recovery.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A group of people flew over from the front. They were the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, they only glanced at Lu Ming and flew past him.</p><p>this won’t do. It’s better to run in the forest. We’ll be too big of a target in the sky. If we meet someone with a meticulous mind, we might become suspicious!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming landed in the forest and ran through the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming arrived at the Western border of the West Wind region. There was a large city in front of him. Once he left the large city, he would enter the territory of the chaotic realm.</p><p>I’ll go to this city to buy some things before entering the chaotic realm. I heard that the climate in the chaotic realm is unpredictable, and some places are devoid of life. It’s best to buy some food and bring it with you!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>With his current cultivation, it was fine even if he didn’t eat for a year. However, he would still eat some food as a habit.</p><p>“Stop, pass through this platform!”</p><p>At the city gates, there were experts from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace standing guard. Anyone who wanted to enter the city had to step on a formation platform.</p><p>Lu Ming had already learned that this platform could test out mental energy fire.</p><p>If one cultivated the Dao of inscription and had an extremely strong mental energy fire, there would be a reaction when they stepped on the platform.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace wanted to trap the talisman Amulet sect because they were afraid that the talisman Amulet sect disciples would sneak out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was a pure martial artist now and did not have any mental energy fire. Naturally, he could pass through the platform easily and enter the city.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming found a market and bought a large number of supplies. He then left the city and headed to the chaotic territory.</p><p>The chaotic domain was a forbidden area to the majority of martial artists.</p><p>Not only did it run from the north to the south, separating the central continent from the East continent, but it was also extremely vast and contained unknown dangers. Even if a spiritual God Realm master was unlucky, there was a possibility of death.</p><p>It was said that the land of chaos had extremely complicated terrains, such as deserts, swamps, barren mountains, and ghost lands.</p><p>It had everything!</p><p>Furthermore, the weather was constantly changing. It could be a clear sky One moment and a storm the next. There might even be flames falling from the sky, making it extremely dangerous.</p><p>There were also some ferocious beasts and evil spirits hidden within. Some of them were extremely powerful, and even spirit God experts would die if they encountered them.</p><p>Therefore, no one was willing to enter the chaotic realm. If they wanted to go to the central continent, they would have to use the teleportation arrays of the Overlord forces.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no choice. He could not expose his identity. He could only move forward and cross over.</p><p>After leaving the city, the road was smooth.</p><p>After more than a hundred thousand miles, a barren mountain range appeared in front of them. There was no vegetation on the mountain range, and it was a barren land with only bare rocks.</p><p>They had already reached the territory of the chaos realm. Lu Ming perked up, slowed down, and flew in.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned the moment he entered the area of the desolate mountains.</p><p>what a high temperature. The temperature from the sun here is dozens of times higher than in other places!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was extremely surprised.</p><p>He retreated for several miles and the temperature returned to normal. It was only a thin line away, but the temperature from the sun was completely different.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. He circulated his essential core to protect his body and flew forward.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>He had not even flown for a few thousand miles when a cry was heard. A giant fiery-red Bird appeared and pounced at Lu Ming like lightning. Before it even reached him, a wave of scorching heat was already heading towards him.</p><p>“Spirit embryo realm beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not expect to encounter a spirit embryo realm ferocious beast the moment he entered the chaos realm.</p><p>A long spear condensed in his hand. The long spear pierced through the air, and with a PU chi sound, the beast was stabbed in the air.</p><p>The devouring power burst forth and devoured the energy of the blood essence of the beast.</p><p>what scorching power! It must be related to the high temperature here!</p><p>Whether it was the beast’s demonic power or blood essence, they were all extremely hot, like flames.</p><p>However, under the condensation of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, it was quickly refined.</p><p>As he continued flying, Lu Ming realized that there weren’t many ferocious beasts here. He would only encounter one occasionally, and most of them were below the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm. Devouring them was of little use to his cultivation.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles later, the desolate mountains disappeared, and what appeared in front of them was a desert.</p><p>The boundless desert was golden in color, and it was impossible to tell how big it was.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped in, he was surprised to find that the temperature here was even more terrifying. It was ten times higher than the desolate mountains and hundreds of times higher than the outside world.</p><p>Not to mention the vegetation, even the most powerful demonic beasts would not be able to survive here. They would die from the high temperature.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming entered, he was surprised to find that there were actually living creatures in the desert.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a type of Sandworm. Its shell was like a fiery red Diamond, shining brightly and extremely hard.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming saw a hundred-meter long centipede swallowing and spitting out the sun essence as if it was bathing in flames.</p><p>As soon as it saw Lu Ming, it pounced at him.</p><p>This centipede was at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm and had extremely powerful combat strength. The flames it spewed out from its mouth seemed to be able to burn everything. Its diamond-like Shell was extremely hard and had an extremely terrifying defense.</p><p>This centipede was much stronger than a martial artist at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm of the same level. The flames it spewed out could easily kill a martial artist of the same level. Lu Ming fought with it for dozens of moves and only killed it after erupting his dragon power. Then, he kept the entire centipede.</p><p>This centipede was full of treasures. If he sold it, he could get a lot of raw stones.</p><p>The desert was really vast. For the next ten days, Lu Ming shuttled through the desert and experienced a few big battles.</p><p>Ten days later, Lu Ming looked at the scene in front of him in a daze.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In front of him, lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled. Terrifying lightning covered the entire sky like lightning snakes. It was extremely terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
