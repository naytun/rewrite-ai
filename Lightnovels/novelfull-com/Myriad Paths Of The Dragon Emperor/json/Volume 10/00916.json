His strength had skyrocketed and it was much higher than before.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his entire body was filled with energy, boundless energy.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dragon roars reverberated as the five golden chakras on the body of the nine-Dragon bloodline shone.</p><p>His nine Dragon bloodline had also been upgraded to the fifth level of the divine level.</p><p>This was all thanks to the leader of the three-eyed God race, who was at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm. He was really powerful. Whether it was his blood essence or energy, they were all extremely powerful. Otherwise, Lu Ming would not have been able to have such a huge improvement.</p><p>and the intent realms of wind, fire, and Thunder are all at the peak of the third level entry. I’m just one step away from the third level lower tier. The earth intent realm is also at the late stage of the third level entry!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>The function of the nine Dragons bloodline was too heaven-defying. It allowed Lu Ming’s cultivation base to skyrocket. It was entirely possible for him to cultivate a few more concepts in the future.</p><p>this time, be it the will or the Zhen Yuan, they have both improved too much. I can already feel that the will and Zhen Yuan are a little messy. I can’t devour them for a while. I need to spend some time to stabilize my Foundation!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not want to go into seclusion to condense all the time. He wanted to search for treasures and opportunities while slowly building his Foundation.</p><p>After all, one and a half months had passed since the battle of Providence. There was less and less time left.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his closed-door cultivation and flew high into the sky. With a flash of his body and a burst of quintessential essence, Lu Ming’s figure was dozens of miles away.</p><p>his vital essence is too strong. With my current cultivation, I can definitely fight with little demon Lord Luo Li, or even kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident smile on his face.</p><p>Compared to the last time he met Luo Li, Lu Ming had improved a lot.</p><p>All four intents had broken through to the third level. With the advancement of the nine Dragon bloodline, he had an additional dragon power. In addition, his cultivation had advanced to the second level of the spirit embryo realm. His combat strength had improved too much.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming searched for elixirs and precious materials while he built his Foundation and stabilized his cultivation.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s speed was not too fast, he still flew hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>On the way, he met a few people from the three-eyed God race, but he didn’t attack them.</p><p>There were powerful beings among these three-eyed God race beings, and there were quite a few of them who were above the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>And in the spirit embryo realm, it was undoubtedly more difficult to fight across levels.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he was confident that he would not be afraid of seventh level spirit embryo realm experts. However, it would be troublesome if he were to be surrounded by many experts of this level.</p><p>Furthermore, his Foundation wasn’t stable yet. Even if he killed the three-eyed God race, he wouldn’t be able to devour them, so he didn’t make a move.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on a large tree, condensing his essential core and polishing his artistic conception. Suddenly, in the distant sky, two figures were flying forward at high speed.</p><p>They were two young men, a man and a woman. Inscriptions glowed on their bodies. Xing Cheng flapped his wings and continued flying forward. However, they seemed to be in a panic and were in a sorry state.</p><p>“The talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming encountered a Talisman Amulet sect disciple since he entered.</p><p>The number of Talisman Amulet sect members participating in the battle of karmic luck was small to begin with, so the chances of encountering one were naturally small.</p><p>However, the two Talisman Amulet sect disciples were obviously running away with someone chasing after them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two or four streaks of light streaked through the air and chased after him.</p><p>They were four young men. From their clothes, they were actually from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>The two forces had actually joined forces to pursue the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>hehe, you can’t run away. Just come with us obediently!</p><p>A Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect, who was covered in corpse Qi, sneered.</p><p>This person had a cultivation at the great circle of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>It had been more than a month and a half since the war of Providence had started. In such an environment, Lu Ming was not the only one making progress. Everyone was making progress as well. Many people’s cultivation levels had also improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>When they first entered, only Wang Yan and the other top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents had a cultivation at the perfected spiritual ocean realm. Even di Feng was only at the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>But now, there were already quite a number of people who had broken through to the perfected spirit sea realm. There were even some who had started to charge towards the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>And those heaven’s favorites who were already above the spirit embryo realm naturally had a breakthrough.</p><p>Everyone was improving, and if they didn’t improve, they would be eliminated.</p><p>Of the other three pursuing youths, one of them had a cultivation base at the perfected spiritual ocean realm, while the other two were at the peak ninth level spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>The four of them were extremely fast as they approached the two Talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>“Let’s go all out with them!”</p><p>The talisman sect’s woman shouted angrily and stopped. More than ten inscription scrolls appeared in her hand. Mental energy fire filled the air, and the inscription scrolls lit up. Attacks burst out one after another, attacking the four people who were chasing after them.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>A Saber Light slashed out. It came from a purple-robed young man from the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The purple-robed young man was another expert at the perfected spirit sea realm.</p><p>Without a doubt, this man was a God-tier heaven’s favorite who had awakened a God-tier bloodline. His combat strength was extremely powerful. As the blade light flashed, the talisman sect woman’s inscription scrolls were all destroyed.</p><p>In the end, the blade light landed on the woman’s body and broke her protective shield. The woman spat out a mouthful of blood and her body drifted back.</p><p>“Junior Sister hai!”</p><p>The talisman sect man supported the woman, his face filled with worry.</p><p>hehe, like I said, you can’t leave. Just come with us obediently!</p><p>The young man from the heavenly corpse sect stepped forward and sneered.</p><p>The four young men from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect had already surrounded the two Talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>don’t even think about it. You captured our Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples just to help you crack the array in the ruins. That array is extremely mysterious and dangerous. Even if we were to crack it, there’s a high chance that we’ll die. The treasures we obtain in the end will belong to you. Don’t even think about it!</p><p>The talisman sect’s young woman was extremely unyielding as she rebuked loudly.</p><p>“Do you still not understand? Your Talisman Amulet sect’s only purpose in participating in the war of Providence is to help us crack the formations in the ruins. Otherwise, we would have killed you long ago if we saw you. Why would we have kept you alive until now?”</p><p>The purple-robed young man said coldly with an air of superiority.</p><p>Kong mingshang, if you want to kill me, then kill me. I’ll help you break the formation. After breaking this one, there’s still the next one. I’ll die sooner or later. Why don’t you kill me now!</p><p>The young woman shouted coldly.</p><p>Kong mingshang was a heaven’s favorite from the Kong family, one of the six great ancient families. He was ranked 198th on the list of top 1000 talents and was a true God-level heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Do you want to die? it’s not that easy. You’re pretty good looking. We can have a good time with you. I’ll see if you beg for mercy under my Majesty’s eyes.”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly corpse sect sneered, and a trace of evil fire flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This made the young woman’s face pale.</p><p>“Everyone, I hope I’m not disturbing you?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stepping in the air and walking toward them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
