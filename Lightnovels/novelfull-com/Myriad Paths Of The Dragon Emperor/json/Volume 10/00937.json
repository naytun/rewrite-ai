It was mainly a trial process. During this process, they would explore some ruins and treasure lands to obtain opportunities and obtain fate value.</p><p>There was also the method of obtaining luck through killing.</p><p>During this process, he could also continuously improve his strength.</p><p>The second stage was to open the ancient city of Providence and start the final battle.</p><p>However, in order to open the ancient city of Providence, there were some conditions. For example, one had to gather some specific treasures before the ancient city of Providence would appear.</p><p>Only when the ancient city of Providence appeared would the value of Providence obtained from the battle of Providence be of great use. It would be able to truly turn into Providence, allowing one’s sect, family, and friends to obtain great benefits.</p><p>If he couldn’t activate the ancient city of Providence, the battle of Providence would end once the time was up. The Providence he had obtained during the process would be useless, and it would mean that he had failed in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Other than some opportunities that he had obtained during this period of time, there was no other use.</p><p>Therefore, opening the ancient city of Providence was the key.</p><p>It was obvious that the ancient city of Providence had been opened using the same totem pillars. In the nine forbidden grounds, only by entering the nine forbidden grounds could one obtain the totem pillars.</p><p>And now, someone had already obtained a totem pole.</p><p>Needless to say, obtaining a totem pole would definitely give him a huge amount of luck.</p><p>The few of them looked at each other. Lu Ming said, ” the forbidden area closest to us is one of the nine forbidden areas, the sky Poison Island. Let’s go to the meeting place first and discuss our next move!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>The group nodded and continued flying.</p><p>Not long after, the group returned to the talisman Amulet sect’s gathering place.</p><p>The talisman sect’s disciples were naturally overjoyed to see Wen zhongtu and the others.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming gathered the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples to discuss the nine forbidden grounds.</p><p>It was obvious that everyone’s book of destiny had received the same message.</p><p>Many people shook their heads and chose to back out.</p><p>I’m not going either. The nine forbidden grounds definitely contain great opportunities, but they are also extremely dangerous. At the same time, all the geniuses will definitely gather in the nine forbidden grounds, which are the places where the strongest geniuses fight for. Even if I go, I won’t be able to obtain any opportunities!</p><p>Ji mai shook his head and sighed.</p><p>Although he was quite powerful, he was still far from the top 1000 talents on the list.</p><p>Then, Meng Jia shook her head, indicating that she was not going.</p><p>In the end, only Lu Ming, Wen zhishi, and Gong Fei decided to go.</p><p>As for the other talisman sect disciples, they planned to gather together and find a good place to inscribe a large formation. They would use it as their base camp and then explore the nearby area to obtain opportunities.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was the best choice.</p><p>If one didn’t have enough power, going to the nine Forbidden Lands would just be throwing their lives away.</p><p>After the discussion, Lu Ming, Wen zhongtu, and Gong Fei bade farewell to the rest and flew in the direction of one of the nine forbidden areas, the sky Poison Island.</p><p>“Xiao Jin, increase our speed!”</p><p>Lu Ming urged as he sat cross-legged on the back of a fierce Golden Tiger, Wen Qishi and Gong Fei.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden Tiger let out an unwilling roar.</p><p>The Golden Tiger was naturally the Vajra.</p><p>At this moment, he had grown to more than 20 meters long. He stepped on the air and ran at an extreme speed.</p><p>In his heart, he was roaring furiously.</p><p>Forget it that Lu Ming treated him as a Mount. He even let others ride on him. Forget it that he let others ride on him. But why did he call him Xiao Jin?</p><p>Xiao Jin. He was a peerless genius of the demon race with 50% of the divine beast bloodline. Lu Ming actually called him Xiao Jin.</p><p>King Kong almost vomited blood.</p><p>His name was so powerful, but he was called little gold?</p><p>When Lu Ming first called out, King Kong was against it, as if he would rather die than submit. When Lu Ming said,’you want to have a taste of the God-splitting array again, right?’, King Kong could only accept his fate, his heart full of resentment towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Are you trying to scare me? hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming slapped King Kong’s head, causing King Kong to grimace in pain and run away. He had already cursed Lu Ming tens of thousands of times in his heart.</p><p>Wen zhishi. Gong Fei’s head was covered in cold sweat. He was truly convinced by Lu Ming.</p><p>To actually be able to tame a demon race’s heaven’s pride as a Mount and even make it so submissive, it was truly amazing.</p><p>The three of them closed their eyes and rested on the back of the Vajra. The Vajra was running extremely fast.</p><p>Not long after, they crossed a distance of over a million li.</p><p>This place was not far from the sky Poison Island.</p><p>Lu Ming had Vajra transform into his human form while Lu Ming, Wen zhishi, and Gong Fei changed their appearances and clothes. They concealed their auras and flew toward the sky Poison Island.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect was being targeted and Lu Ming was the target of the Emperor sky divine Palace and the sky demon Valley. It would be troublesome if he appeared with his true appearance. It was better to disguise himself.</p><p>After changing their appearances, the four of them flew forward.</p><p>It was getting more and more desolate ahead. There were mountains everywhere, but on the mountains, there was a dead silence and no life.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles later, there was a large depression in the mountains. It was a huge Lake, and it was difficult to see the end.</p><p>On the surface of the lake, green fog was spreading, blocking one’s line of sight. One couldn’t see far at all. One could only vaguely see that in the center of the lake, there was a huge object. It was the sky Poison Island.</p><p>On the lakeshore, there were many figures standing. They were only looking into the distance, and no one flew into the lake.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, they only cast a cold glance at them and turned away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air rang out. A few figures flew over from the distance and landed on the lakeshore.</p><p>These people had thick demonic Qi. They were the talents of the heavenly monster tribe.</p><p>“This is the sky Poison Island!”</p><p>A few of the demon race’s heaven’s favorites looked excited.</p><p>“Why don’t you guys go in?”</p><p>A young man from the demon race, who was wearing colorful clothes, asked the others.</p><p>“Can’t you see? The surface of the lake is filled with poisonous gas. How do we cross it?”</p><p>A human youth said. From his clothes, he should be a genius of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>hehe, a mere poisonous gas is enough to stop all of you. What a bunch of trash! You still want to fight for the totem pole? go home!</p><p>The colorful-clothed young man sneered. He stepped on the air and turned into a colorful Python, flying toward the lake.</p><p>The Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect sneered.</p><p>The colorful giant python was very fast. In a few breaths, it had rushed into the lake and into the green mist.</p><p>However, as soon as he charged into the green mist, he let out a shrill scream. His colorful body actually let out a sizzling sound and began to rot.</p><p>The colorful giant python desperately flew back, but after flying for a few miles, it fell into the lake with a scream. Its body rotted, and soon, only white bones were left.</p><p>What a terrifying poisonous gas!</p><p>Lu Ming, Wen Qishi, and Gong Fei’s eyes turned grave.</p><p>The rainbow-colored giant python had already reached the seventh level, which was equivalent to the cultivation of the first level of the spirit embryo realm. Yet, it was unable to put up any resistance and was poisoned to death.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The expressions of the other demon race heaven’s favorites who came with the colorful Python changed.</p><p>“Hehe, what an idiot. Didn’t you do any investigation before coming here? The poisonous gas in this Lake is extremely poisonous, and it’s impossible to cross it. But every three months, the poisonous gas in the lake will dissipate for seven days, and that’s the best chance to enter the sky Poison Island. Now, there’s still half a month before the poisonous gas dissipates. Just wait!”</p><p>The Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
