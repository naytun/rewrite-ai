His entire body was like a peerless divine weapon.</p><p>...</p><p>“Jiang Taichong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s rank on the list of top 1000 talents was higher than Wang Yan’S. He was ranked 92nd, and his combat strength was even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected to meet Jiang Taichong here.</p><p>It could not be such a coincidence. It was highly possible that Jiang Taichong had met Wang Yan a long time ago and was lying in ambush in the nearby area, waiting for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to run.”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed excitedly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. He swung his arm in the air, and a terrifying sword light came slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>With Jiang Taichong at the front and Wang Yan at the back, Lu Ming was in a desperate situation.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a puppet of the first grade of the seventh level pounced forward and was directly cut in half by Jiang Taichong’s sword light.</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s combat strength was stronger than Wang Yan’s.</p><p>“I can only risk it all!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. The nine Dragon bloodline emerged and Lu Ming used the bloodline fusion to transform into Nine Dragons, which charged madly at Wang Yan.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared as a terrifying devouring power erupted and enveloped Wang Yan.</p><p>At the same time, nine dragon claws stepped out in succession.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Transforming into the nine Dragons and using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was the purest form of the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, and its power could be maximized.</p><p>With six consecutive steps, a terrifying force was blasted towards Wang Yan.</p><p>“You want to break through from my side? laughable! Die!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s entire body was ablaze with flames as he sent out a terrifying Flaming Fist radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out as the flaming Fist radiance dispersed the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. However, the remaining power had already been reduced by a lot. When it landed on the bodies of the nine Dragons, their bodies trembled, but they did not care and continued to pounce towards Wang Yan.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wang Yan threw another punch.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about this punch. His Dragon Claw stepped in the air and he took another six steps. A powerful force blasted towards Wang Yan. It was a fight where he would risk his life.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying fist force hit the bodies of the nine Dragons. In an instant, the scales exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. A huge wound was blown on the bodies of the nine Dragons, and the hot flame force kept rushing into the wound.</p><p>However, the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps also slammed down on Wang Yan.</p><p>Wang Yan’s expression changed as he was forced to retreat by the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine claws of the nine Dragons stomped on the void. This time, it was extremely fast. The huge dragon body instantly turned into a stream of light, rushing past Wang Yan’s head and flying towards the direction of Double Moon Mountain.</p><p>“Dammit! Chase!”</p><p>Wang Yan roared and chased after Lu Ming. Jiang Taichong did the same.</p><p>One chasing and one escaping, the distance of thousands of miles was crossed in an instant.</p><p>The double Moon Mountain was right in front of them.</p><p>there is indeed a powerful formation on the double Moon Mountain!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The double Moon Mountain was formed by two mountain peaks that intersected like two moons. At the intersection of the two mountain peaks, there was a huge stone door that seemed to be a cave.</p><p>However, the area in front of the stone gate was filled with formations.</p><p>Previously, he had heard the three-eyed God race mention the double Moon Mountain briefly. The three-eyed God race did not know about formations, but from his words, Lu Ming could tell that there was a formation set up in front of the double Moon Mountain.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming rushed over.</p><p>With the array, it was Lu Ming’s chance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming transformed back into his human form and rushed towards the double Moon Mountain.</p><p>After he charged in, his figure constantly flickered, sometimes left and sometimes right, slowly moving forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong had arrived.</p><p>After the two of them arrived, they stopped with unsightly expressions.</p><p>They had arrived a few days ago and already knew that there was a formation here.</p><p>this little bastard is proficient in the Dao of inscription. This formation can’t stop him!</p><p>Wang Yan’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>“Watch me break it!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong strode forward, and a formation emerged on the ground at once. Saber lights that looked like crescent moons slashed toward Jiang Taichong.</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s palm kept slashing out. The sharp and terrifying sword light kept colliding with the crescent-shaped Saber Light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out. After a while, Jiang Taichong returned with no success and retreated with an ugly expression. He could not rush in at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already passed through the layers of inscription arrays and arrived at an open space in front.</p><p>There was no formation in the innermost area.</p><p>“If you have the ability, then come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong with a cold smile.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Yan bellowed.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was a formation in the air, so they couldn’t get in.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He sat cross-legged and began to recuperate.</p><p>Earlier on, he had transformed into the nine Dragons and received Wang Yan’s punch head-on. However, he was still injured, and his injuries were rather serious. He needed to recuperate as soon as possible.</p><p>Circulating his war Dragon true vitality, Lu Ming began to heal his injured body.</p><p>Outside, Wang Yan and Jiang Taichong’s faces were extremely gloomy. Lu Ming was actually recuperating in front of them. This almost made the two of them explode in anger.</p><p>the array here has been around for many years and it’s not very powerful. We just have to keep bombarding it and deplete the energy of the array. When the energy of the array is depleted, we can rush in and kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Jiang Taichong took a deep breath to calm himself down and analyzed.</p><p>Wang Yan’s eyes lit up as he said happily, ” not bad, not bad. The formation here isn’t particularly strong. We can definitely withstand it. As long as we keep bombarding it, we’ll definitely be able to break it. Let’s start!</p><p>Jiang Taichong nodded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them burst out with powerful auras and stepped forward at the same time, entering the area of the array.</p><p>Immediately, a formation appeared, and countless Crescent Blade lights condensed and slashed toward the two. The two launched their attacks, clashing with the crescent Blade lights.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and took a look outside. He then closed his eyes again and began to recuperate.</p><p>He naturally understood Jiang Taichong and Wang Yan’s plan. However, at this moment, he could only recuperate first before thinking about other things.</p><p>After a day and a night, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taichong and Wang Yan rested for a while before continuing to crack the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked towards the stone door that was located at the intersection of the two mountains.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Seeing this, Wang Yan roared in anger.</p><p>it doesn’t matter. We’ll block him from the outside. Even if he gets the opportunity, he won’t be able to escape from our hands in the end!</p><p>Jiang Taichong was much calmer than Wang Yan as he spoke.</p><p>Wang Yan also calmed down and continued to break the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the stone door, stretched out his hands, pressed on the stone door, and gave it a hard push.</p><p>It didn’t move at all. The stone door didn’t move at all.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped back, then took a step forward and punched the stone door.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the entire earth was shaking, but the stone door still did not move or be blown open.</p><p>“It’s so hard!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
