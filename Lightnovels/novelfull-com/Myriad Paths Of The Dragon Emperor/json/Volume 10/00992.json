I’ll go to Lishui City with you when my injuries are more stable!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En, you should recuperate. We’ll help you keep a lookout!”</p><p>An ‘an said. She then walked to the side with a’ Lei to keep a lookout for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and closed his eyes to recuperate.</p><p>After a period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s body had reached the peak of the eighth-grade and his recovery ability was extremely shocking. Combined with the true war Dragon technique, he began to recover at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>After half an hour, Lu Ming’s injuries had stabilized and he had recovered 20% of his essential core.</p><p>Of course, with a ‘ke and a’ Lei’s cultivation, they could not tell Lu Ming’s cultivation realm.</p><p>“Miss a ‘Lei, miss a’ Lei, I’m almost done. We can go now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>A ‘Qing asked in surprise.</p><p>I’m not too seriously injured. I’ll recuperate in Lishui City!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, that’s good. Is your little turtle alright?”</p><p>A ‘an looked at dandan who was on Lu Ming’s shoulder. At this time, dandan was still twitching.</p><p>“It’s fine, this guy will be fine after twitching!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually, which made dandan gnash her teeth.</p><p>What did he mean by just twitching?</p><p>Then, the three of them took to the air and left for Lishui City.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of miles, what appeared in front of them were large rivers and lakes that dotted the ground. From the sky, they looked like pearls.</p><p>This was a Water Village!</p><p>The three of them chatted as they hurried on their way. Lu Ming roughly knew the location of this place.</p><p>The strongest force in this Water Village was the floating mountain sect.</p><p>The floating mountain sect was one of the overlords of the central continent.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had already gained a general understanding of the central continent before he came.</p><p>The central continent was extremely vast, at least seven to eight times larger than the East continent.</p><p>Furthermore, the land was blessed with many talents. There were countless paradises and blessed lands. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was rich. The practice of cultivation was flourishing. There had always been countless geniuses and experts. It was the center of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In the central continent, whether it was the number of geniuses or the quality, the East continent could not compare.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent was undoubtedly the most ancient and largest power in the central continent.</p><p>In fact, the central continent had been completely under the rule of the ancient Saint dynasty tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty had a long history, and it was said that it had been passed down for a million years. In this million years, the central continent had been completely under the rule of the ancient Saint dynasty. It was prosperous and extremely powerful. There were many geniuses and powerful cultivators, far above the East barren.</p><p>At that time, not only the central continent, even the East barren, the South nether and the other four territories had to bow down to the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>However, all of this had changed drastically tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, an unrivaled figure had appeared in the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty. He had started a rebellion, and an unprecedented Civil War had broken out in the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>That battle was earth-shattering. Countless experts were killed or injured, and even many emperors fell.</p><p>After that battle, the power of the ancient Saint dynasty’s royal family declined rapidly and they could no longer control the vast central continent.</p><p>After that, central continent entered the era of various emperors.</p><p>For tens of thousands of years, the various Overlord forces had ruled their own territories and fought for supremacy.</p><p>In addition to these Overlord forces, there were countless smaller forces that relied on the Overlord forces and fought endlessly.</p><p>The central continent was more chaotic than the East continent.</p><p>The floating mountain sect occupied the vast territory of the eastern part of the central continent. It was an Overlord of a region and had an Emperor overseeing it. Its strength was incomparably powerful and wasn’t any weaker than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace or the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Lishui City was a city under the jurisdiction of the floating mountain sect, and the Xiao family, where the two sisters were from, was a small family in the city.</p><p>The two sisters of the Xiao family were very innocent and did not have any schemes. They felt that Lu Ming was a good person and treated him as a friend. They would answer whatever Lu Ming asked.</p><p>During the conversation, Lu Ming learned that their mother had passed away after they were born. Their father had also passed away a few years ago when he was out adventuring.</p><p>They had been following their grandfather, the head of the Xiao family, Xiao Zhan.</p><p>But some time ago, Xiao Zhan entered the chaotic mountains in search of an elixir. Unexpectedly, he was bitten by a poisonous Rainbow Snake and was still in a coma.</p><p>The two sisters had come to the chaotic mountains to find the nest of the poisonous Rainbow Snake and the accompanying elixir to save Xiao Zhan. Unfortunately, after many days of searching, they had not even found the shadow of the poisonous Rainbow Snake. It was only later that they met Lu Ming.</p><p>“Maybe I can cure your grandfather’s poison!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This caused the Xiao sisters to pause, and their eyes widened. “You … Can you really save him? The Alchemist said that my grandfather’s poison has already spread to his entire body. Unless you have the accompanying spirit medicine of the poisonous Rainbow Snake, it will be difficult to save him!”</p><p>As they spoke, the two sisters ‘eyes began to turn red again.</p><p>“I’ve cultivated a secret technique and I’m quite experienced in detoxification!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons could devour all kinds of poisonous gas and poison. When others were poisoned, they could also devour the poisonous gas.</p><p>“Really? You’re not allowed to side with us!”</p><p>A ‘an’s eyes were filled with hope. The two sisters looked at Lu Ming without blinking.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded solemnly.</p><p>“That’s great!” The two sisters smiled happily.</p><p>Two days later, li water city appeared in front of them.</p><p>Lishui City was very magnificent. Although it could not be compared to a giant city like ninedragons, it was still a big deal and was extremely wide.</p><p>On the streets, people came and went, each one of them in high spirits and full of energy. The number of experts was very large.</p><p>Lu Ming had only strolled along one street and he had already discovered many spirit embryo realm experts.</p><p>There was a forest of shops on both sides of the street. Lu Ming looked around curiously.</p><p>The customs of the central continent were very different from that of the East continent.</p><p>After passing through a few streets, a huge mansion appeared in front of them. They had arrived at the Xiao family.</p><p>The two sisters were the precious granddaughters of the Xiao family’s master. Naturally, they did not stop Lu Ming from following the two sisters into the Xiao family.</p><p>However, when he walked past a courtyard, he was stopped by a young man.</p><p>The young man was about 25 or 26 years old. He was wearing a long green robe, a Jade belt around his waist, and a pair of Golden Boots. He exuded a rich and powerful aura.</p><p>“Desolate ning!”</p><p>Upon seeing this young man, the two sisters frowned slightly.</p><p>“Ah Luo, ah Lei, where have you been these past few days?”</p><p>The young man asked.</p><p>“It’s none of your business where we go!”</p><p>A ‘an pouted and said.</p><p>“Why should I care? Don’t you know that the future of house Xiao is at stake right now? if anything happens to you, you won’t be able to bear the consequences!”</p><p>Desolate ning’s eyes turned cold as he said.</p><p>“Hmph, what future of the Xiao family? it’s your future!” A-Qing said sarcastically.</p><p>“I can’t be bothered to talk to you!”</p><p>Desolate ning opened the fan in his hand and started to wave it gently. Then, he turned to look at Lu Ming and frowned,”Who is this person? Achoo, don’t bring any Tom, Dick, or Harry into the family. Others will laugh at you if they know.”</p><p>this is a friend of mine and Lei’s. He’s here to treat his injuries. It’s none of your business. Also, big brother Lu can cure grandfather’s poison. Hmph, he’ll be an important guest of the Xiao family!</p><p>A-Qing raised her head and said proudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
