They had seen Lu Ming catch them off guard in the capital and seize the last totem pole.</p><p>...</p><p>Hmph, he’s relying on treasures to catch me off guard. He’d better not touch me in the fight for fate later. Otherwise, I’ll definitely kill him!</p><p>Luo Tian said coldly. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right, I’ll kill him too!”</p><p>Another person coldly spoke.</p><p>The Emperor God didn’t say anything, but his eyes were cold.</p><p>The battle for Providence had not ended yet. There was still a second stage, the battle for Providence.</p><p>He might not be able to keep the luck he had seized before.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered with the gazes of these people.</p><p>“Let’s go up the stairs and head to the fighting ring!”</p><p>Someone said and stepped forward.</p><p>In front of this platform, there was a huge flight of stairs that led upwards.</p><p>Some people had already started to step forward.</p><p>Then, all the forces stepped forward.</p><p>In fact, even if the few major forces were added together, they did not have many people.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect had over a thousand people who had participated in the battle of Providence, but now, there were less than four hundred left.</p><p>Back then, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had close to 10000 people who had participated in the battle of Providence, including the death Warriors. Now, they only had 2000 plus people. It could be said that they had suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect only had less than two thousand.</p><p>The sky demon Valley was slightly better off, with nearly two thousand people.</p><p>Of course, the rest of them had more or less obtained some opportunities. Some of them had even obtained great opportunities. As long as they survived, their future prospects were limitless.</p><p>Everyone went up the stairs but Lu Ming immediately saw a strange phenomenon.</p><p>For example, the remaining suicide soldiers of the heavenly corpse sect and the Emperor sky divine Palace could climb the stairs very quickly. Their bodies were light and agile. As for those famous geniuses, their speed was much slower. It was as if they were carrying a huge mountain on their backs. Each step was extremely difficult.</p><p>it’s said that the higher one’s luck value is, the greater the pressure one will face when walking up the stairs. It will be more difficult to walk!</p><p>On the side, Huan Zhen said.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. No wonder.</p><p>Those men of sacrifice were in charge of exploring some dangerous places. Any treasures would naturally belong to the elites. These men of sacrifice did not have much fate value, so they were naturally light and fast.</p><p>On the stairs and around the fighting ring, the higher-ups of the four forces were staring at the stairs without blinking.</p><p>“Someone’s coming up!”</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted, and many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>A young man in a blood-red robe with dull eyes walked up the stairs and stepped into the battle stage. He was a death warrior of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>When he stepped onto the fighting ring, a book of destiny appeared in front of him. The Book of Destiny turned into a small worm and appeared above the young man’s head. However, the next moment, the small worm crumbled, and a beam of light suddenly appeared above the young man’s head. With a flash, the young man was teleported away and appeared on a seat in the heavenly corpse sect’s area.</p><p>No one was surprised.</p><p>In the first phase of the battle of Providence, the map would change every time. However, in the second phase, the map of the ancient city of Providence would change every time.</p><p>This heavenly corpse sect’s deathsworn obviously did not have enough luck value and had been eliminated in advance.</p><p>To qualify for the next round of the battle for Providence, one had to obtain a certain amount of Providence value. If one’s Providence value did not meet the standard, all the previously obtained Providence value would disappear and be wasted. One would be sent to the stands and eliminated in advance.</p><p>This was the same for every battle of Providence.</p><p>Following that, more and more people came up.</p><p>However, the ones who had come up were all people with very low fate. The Book of Destiny turned into a bug and then collapsed, being teleported away.</p><p>The number of people in the stands slowly increased.</p><p>In the beginning, most of them were death Warriors, followed by some young geniuses and heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>Someone’s book of destiny condensed a small snake that was many times larger than the small worm from before. However, it still collapsed and was eliminated early.</p><p>Thousands of people were eliminated.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a flash of light.</p><p>The Book of Destiny of a young man in green collapsed and turned into a giant python.</p><p>The giant python roared in a majestic manner. It was much stronger than the small insects and snakes from before.</p><p>Moreover, the giant python didn’t collapse. It was still hovering above his head. He wasn’t teleported to the stands, but remained on the fighting ring.</p><p>serpents of fate. Only those with more than 3000 points of fate can turn into serpents. Only then can they retain their fate and enter the battle for fate!</p><p>An old man in the Emperor heaven divine Palace spoke.</p><p>The young man was ecstatic.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize this young man. He was Qin Qingshan, who was ranked 999th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>He barely qualified for the next round.</p><p>The next young men were all able to transform their fate into pythons. The giant pythons spiralled above the heads of these young men, which was quite spectacular.</p><p>In the end, more than 1000 people were able to transform into pythons.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a roar reverberated through the entire area, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>A three-meter-long flood Dragon appeared above the head of a young man. It was more majestic and powerful than the Pythons.</p><p>Fate turning into a flood Dragon!</p><p>Only when one’s luck value reached 10000 or more could one’s luck transform into a flood Dragon.</p><p>Luck value, 3000 to 10000. Luck transformed into a Python.</p><p>From 10,000 to 100000 points of luck, one’s luck would transform into a flood Dragon.</p><p>When one’s luck value reached more than 100000, one could transform their luck into a Dragon. The length of the Dragon would be different depending on the amount of luck.</p><p>Starting from this young man, the stage of the fate turning into a flood Dragon had begun.</p><p>“Hmph, Talisman Amulet sect, I didn’t expect you to still have many disciples alive!”</p><p>The Wang clan’s patriarch looked towards the talisman sect and mocked.</p><p>Now, there were already quite a number of talisman sect disciples who had appeared. Bai Shijin and the others were slightly more at ease.</p><p>I’ve said it before. The disciples of my Talisman Amulet sect have their own opportunities. How can they die so easily? it seems that quite a few of you are missing!</p><p>Bai Shijin sneered.</p><p>hehe, the main thing is to see how many of your so-called peerless geniuses from the talisman Amulet sect can stay!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan sneered.</p><p>Those who were able to turn into a Dragon were definitely the cream of the crop. That was because the young man who had turned into a Dragon was a God-tier genius.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites who came up later were the core of the sects.</p><p>……</p><p>“Heavens, why is it so heavy!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had also stepped onto the stairs. However, he felt as if hundreds of mountains were pressing down on him. It was difficult for him to move. He had to use a lot of strength to take one step.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and climbed up with great difficulty.</p><p>On the stairs, Lu Ming saw di Shen, Xue Jianyi of the heavenly corpse sect, and a burly young man of the sky demon Valley. They were also walking very slowly, their bodies trembling slightly.</p><p>The fatty was also very slow, but relatively speaking, he was much faster than Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, why are you so slow? I’ve finally surpassed you!”</p><p>The fat man grinned happily. His fat trembled as he walked forward step by step, in front of di Shen and the others.</p><p>There was also one person who was slow, and that was Bai chixue.</p><p>However, she was a bit faster than the fatty. Huan Zhen was also behind Bai chixue.</p><p>Ruan Tingting, on the other hand, was a little faster and was about to reach the top of the stairs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
