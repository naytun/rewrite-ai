BOOM!</p><p>...</p><p>As the fist radiance continued to strike out, the spiritual God became even weaker.</p><p>If it was an ordinary spiritual God, Lu Ming would definitely not be a match for him. However, this old three-eyed God was suppressed before he could even break through to the spiritual God Realm. He could only be considered a half-spiritual God, and his body was severely injured. He was extremely weak and completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After a while, the spirit God swayed and flew back into the body of the old three-eyed God.</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God let out a heaven-shaking roar, ” “Don’t even think about getting the totem pole, I’m going to destroy it!”</p><p>With that, the old three-eyed God’s body suddenly moved, and he pounced in a certain direction.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the cave. He saw a stone pillar about three meters tall at the side of the cave. There were various patterns carved on the stone pillar, such as dragons, phoenixes, and tigers.</p><p>“This is a totem pole!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He had been so focused on the old three-eyed God that he did not notice the totem pole.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming took a step forward and charged towards the old three-eyed God. A long spear materialized in his hand and he pierced through the old three-eyed God.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear pierced through the old three-eyed God’s body, nailing him to the wall.</p><p>“I’m not willing to accept this! My three-eyed God race will annihilate the human race sooner or later!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” arghh! the ancient three-eyed God let out a furious and unwilling roar, and then he died.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He could understand the old three-eyed divine being’s unwillingness to give up. He had cultivated arduously for his entire life and was about to break through to the spiritual God Realm, but he was suppressed and his entire life’s efforts were in vain. He could only hide in this cave and wait for his life to run out before dying of old age here.</p><p>However, the two of them were of different races and were hostile to each other. Lu Ming had no reason to sympathize with them.</p><p>His gaze fell on the stone pillar.</p><p>“Is this the totem pole?” The purpose of Lu Ming’s visit was for it.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the bottom of the totem pole and hugged it with both hands. He lifted it with force but it did not move at all.</p><p>“It’s quite heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He exerted all his strength, the essential core in his body exploded, and he pulled with all his might.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire cave started to shake. Lu Ming slowly pulled out the totem pole.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pulled the mountain with all his might. The muscles all over his body bulged and he exerted force on his waist. With a loud bang, the totem pole was pulled up.</p><p>However, at this moment, the totem pole suddenly glowed brightly. More than ten rays of black light suddenly burst out and flew towards the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was because with a quick glance, he could see that the dozen or so rays of light were actually a dozen or so spiritual gods, all of them in the form of miniature three-eyed God race beings.</p><p>At this moment, the skeleton of the old three-eyed divine race member flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Could those skeletons be the same as the ancient three-eyed God, the three-eyed God that was suppressed after breaking through to the spiritual God Realm and died here?</p><p>After they died, the spirit God attached itself to the totem pole.</p><p>“We’ve been tricked!”</p><p>Just now, the old three-eyed God pretended to destroy the totem pillar, but he was actually reminding Lu Ming that it was a totem pillar. He wanted to remind Lu Ming to pull it out, and once he pulled it out, the spiritual gods in the totem pillar would attack Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, everything happened so suddenly. It was too late for Lu Ming to Dodge.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than ten spiritual gods rushed into Lu Ming’s glabella and into his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and closed his eyes. His mind appeared in his sea of consciousness and condensed into a physical form.</p><p>More than a dozen spiritual gods appeared in his spiritual sea, exuding all kinds of powerful auras.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>One of the spiritual gods exuded a strong aura of lightning. It seemed to have no intelligence and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Fast, extremely fast.</p><p>what a powerful Thunder intent! These spiritual gods are formed by energy and the intent realm of heaven and earth. Their original owner’s consciousness has been destroyed, and only their instinct is left. Their instinct to kill humans!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He immediately simulated the prison-suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body went numb. He was sent flying and his body almost dissipated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At that moment, the other spiritual God turned into a beam of fire. An extremely rich concept of fire spread out and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be on fire as he was sent flying. His entire body was in excruciating pain.</p><p>These spiritual gods wanted to obliterate Lu Ming’s mind and will. If Lu Ming’s will was obliterated, it would be equivalent to his death.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of golden light cut through the clouds in his sea of consciousness and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The creation of gold!</p><p>The wills of these spiritual gods were all at the fourth level and were extremely powerful.</p><p>The fourth-level intent realm of heaven and earth was the highest level. These people had already mastered the highest level of intent realm, which was many times stronger than the third-level intent realm.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was cut in half by the golden light, and a sharp pain that seeped into his soul came from his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body, which had been split in half, retreated rapidly and re-condensed in the distance. However, his face was very pale.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, his body was formed by his mind. Even if it was split apart, it could still reform. However, the pain was real.</p><p>His current situation was very dangerous. In the sea of consciousness, his body could indeed reform at will, but if he couldn’t bear the pain and his will dissipated, his body would never be able to reform again, which meant his death.</p><p>This was a test of will.</p><p>“My will is firm, how can I be destroyed by you!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in a low voice. His eyes were extremely determined.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The two spiritual gods pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill? in my sea of consciousness, let’s see who will kill who?”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and pounced on the few spiritual gods.</p><p>After a few moves, Lu Ming was still scattered. However, in the distance, he condensed again. His will was firm and he was unmoved.</p><p>They continued to fight.</p><p>He used all of his knowledge in this sea of consciousness to fight against the dozen spiritual gods.</p><p>His will was firm. No matter how great the pain was, he would not be moved and would fight with all his might.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage and had almost no power to fight back.</p><p>However, the more Lu Ming fought, the braver he became. He was getting used to fighting in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Ten days later, Lu Ming severely injured a spiritual God with the concept of fire with one punch, breaking his arm.</p><p>The broken arm turned into fire concept and entered Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the fire concept had actually improved by a small margin.</p><p>“You can do this? Then you’ll become my nourishment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a bright light. He was in high spirits as he fought against these spiritual gods.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body continued to hold onto the totem pole. He stood in the cave, unmoving. His true war Dragon technique was actually circulating on its own, like a vortex, absorbing the spirit Qi and origin Qi of the surroundings.</p><p>His cultivation base was slowly rising.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the more he fought, the more courageous he became. A month later, a spiritual God was completely defeated by Lu Ming. The corresponding intent realm of heaven and earth was absorbed by Lu Ming, and his corresponding intent realm was improved by a large margin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
