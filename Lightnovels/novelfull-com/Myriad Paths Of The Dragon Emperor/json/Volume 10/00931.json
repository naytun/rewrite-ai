We’re currently being surrounded by the three-eyed God race. I’ll hide in a Palace and charge out after a while.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Zongzi, you have to be careful!”</p><p>A talisman sect disciple asked worriedly.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then looked at Bai chixue, ” Chi Xue, let’s go to the side!</p><p>Then, he walked to the side, followed by Bai chixue.</p><p>The others were tactful and did not disturb him, each finding a place to cultivate.</p><p>“Chi Xue, you must have obtained the inheritance of the Emperor, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Yes, that’s right. It’s a pity that there are still many things that I can’t see. My current cultivation is still too low!</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was normal. For example, when he obtained the legacy of Lian Cang, Lian Cang had set a seal for him.</p><p>On the path of cultivation, one could not aim too high. One had to take it one step at a time and walk up step by step to reach the peak. If one saw too many things at once, one would be confused and lose one’s direction.</p><p>Chi Xue, how much luck did you get? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat curious. How many points of luck could one gain from an Emperor’s legacy?</p><p>“Fifty thousand!”</p><p>Bai chixue blinked her eyes and said. Although she was trying her best to hold it in, she could still see the excitement in her eyes.</p><p>“Fifty thousand?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He did not think that Bai chixue had gained too much, but too little.</p><p>When he had obtained the mountain and river diagram, he had obtained 100000 fate points.</p><p>In that case, the value of the mountain and river diagram was even more valuable than the inheritance of an Emperor?</p><p>“Lu Ming, how many points of luck have you obtained?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming curiously. She was eager to try and surpass him.</p><p>“A few hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Ten … A hundred thousand?”</p><p>Bai chixue was tongue-tied, and finally, she felt dejected.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly laughed. This little girl wanted to compete with him!</p><p>alright, you’ve obtained the emperor’s inheritance. Cultivate well. I’m going out!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s figure disappeared.</p><p>He returned to the secret chamber and put away the mountain and river diagram. Lu Ming sat cross-legged and cultivated quietly, stabilizing his Foundation.</p><p>Time flew by and half a month passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was ready to go out.</p><p>Now that his cultivation had advanced to the third level of the spirit embryo realm, he was confident that with the mountain and river diagram protecting him, even a ninth level spirit embryo realm expert wouldn’t be able to hurt him.</p><p>Lu Ming came out of the palace and flew above one of the palaces to look outside.</p><p>Outside, it was completely empty. Not a single three-eyed God could be seen.</p><p>The three-eyed God race had all left.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that there were many people participating in the war of Providence. Seeing that they could not find them, the three-eyed God race left to hunt down the others.</p><p>“I don’t know if brother Litian and the seventh sanguine swordsman were killed or if they managed to escape,”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment, then he rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of miles, they still didn’t encounter any three-eyed gods.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming found a secret place and entered the mountain and river diagram. He told the talisman Amulet sect disciples that he was out of danger and asked if they wanted to go out.</p><p>Everyone naturally wanted to go out. The purpose of participating in the battle of Providence was to find opportunities. If they were to hide here, they might as well not have participated in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Lu Ming moved everyone out of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“How about this? during this period of time, let’s move together and search for opportunities. After that, we will gather even more symbol puppet sect disciples. What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>“Is Lu Ming zongzi coming with us? That’s great!”</p><p>The talisman sect disciples were overjoyed.</p><p>They had already witnessed how powerful Lu Ming was. With Lu Ming, their chances of obtaining opportunities would be higher and the chances of encountering danger would be lower.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was not due to his sudden kindness.</p><p>He did this for two reasons.</p><p>First, he had to win the hearts of the people. These young geniuses would definitely be the pillars of the talisman Amulet sect in the future. If he wanted to control the talisman Amulet sect in the future, it would be very important to gain the support of these geniuses.</p><p>If he did them a favor now, they would naturally be loyal to him in the future.</p><p>Secondly, the more fate energy the talisman Amulet sect obtained, the more beneficial it would be to the entire sect. Naturally, it would be beneficial to Lu Ming as well. Why would he not do it?</p><p>alright, we’ll look for opportunities while you guys contact the talisman sect disciples nearby!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In this world, the transmission distance of a Jade voice transmission talisman was greatly suppressed. The transmission distance was less than one-tenth or even one-hundredth of the outside world. Even a high-level Jade voice transmission talisman could only contact people within a radius of a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>With everything planned out, everyone began to move.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming led the group to search for some strange places to explore while contacting other members of the talisman sect.</p><p>As time passed, more and more Talisman Amulet sect disciples gathered. Everyone’s respect and gratitude for Lu Ming grew.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was recognized by everyone.</p><p>During this period, they explored several strange places and obtained quite a few opportunities. They also encountered some dangers, such as the pursuit of the three-eyed God race. However, under Lu Ming’s lead, they managed to overcome them one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally won the hearts of the people.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming understood more about this world.</p><p>During this period of time, he captured a few three-eyed gods alive and obtained a lot of information from them.</p><p>This world was very vast.</p><p>The three-eyed God race’s Royal City was located in the center of this world.</p><p>Within the three-eyed God race’s capital, there were many powerful experts.</p><p>With the royal city as the center, it was divided into four major areas. Lu Ming and the rest had been active in the eastern area.</p><p>There must be even more heaven’s favorites in the other three directions.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>It had been half a year since the battle of Providence had begun.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on the peak of a mountain. His body glowed and a Dragon’s Roar could be heard.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s aura surged. However, in the next moment, his aura was concealed again.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“Fourth level spirit embryo realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>In the past few months, he hadn’t killed many three-eyed gods. Most of them were cultivated by himself, and he had made great progress.</p><p>The four intents had all entered the lower tier of the third level. Today, his cultivation had also broken through to the fourth level spirit embryo realm, and his Foundation was extremely stable.</p><p>At the spirit embryo realm, it was extremely difficult to make a breakthrough.</p><p>In the outside world, even geniuses would find it difficult to break through a level without a few years.</p><p>As for some of the more ordinary spirit embryo experts, it was normal for them to spend decades or even centuries to break through one tier.</p><p>It was already very fast for Lu Ming to be able to break through one level within three months by relying on his own hard work.</p><p>&Nbsp; this was also due to the excellent cultivation environment and the fact that he had devoured a few three-eyed gods.</p><p>Other people might not have such a speed. Moreover, the higher one went, the slower one’s cultivation would be.</p><p>Not far away, some Talisman Amulet sect disciples were cultivating, while others were patrolling the area.</p><p>In three months, they had already gathered more than sixty Talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
