Sure, I’ll kill you right now. And you, you’re as beautiful as a fairy, this young master doesn’t mind letting you have a good time!”</p><p>...</p><p>The little demonic Lord stared at Bai chixue with his eyes full of evil fire.</p><p>If not for the fact that there were people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley, he would have executed Bai chixue on the spot.</p><p>Bai chixue’s face turned pale when she saw the little demon Lord’s evil eyes. She did not dare to say anything.</p><p>“You, you and you, you guys go first and break the formation!”</p><p>The little demon Lord pointed at five of them and said coldly.</p><p>The five people’s faces turned ugly and they sighed.</p><p>He had no choice but to break the formation. If he did, he might still be able to survive. If he didn’t, he would be killed.</p><p>Previously, two Talisman Amulet sect disciples had gone against the little demon Lord and were brutally killed by him.</p><p>Who didn’t know that the various devil Lords of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were cruel and merciless?</p><p>As the five Talisman Amulet sect disciples walked into the ruins, the three parties from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were closely watching them.</p><p>After a while, light began to shine from inside. The disciples of the talisman Amulet sect had already begun to break the array.</p><p>But not long after, a scream was heard.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The little demon Lord’s voice spread far and wide.</p><p>“A talisman sect disciple tried to break the formation but was killed by the formation!”</p><p>A disciple of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace came to report.</p><p>“You’re really trash!” The little demon Lord shouted coldly.</p><p>Bai chixue and the other disciples of the talisman sect looked miserable.</p><p>Among the four great powers, the talisman Amulet sect was the weakest. Now that the other three powers had joined forces to deal with them, they had no way of resisting.</p><p>“These Talisman Amulet sect disciples are too weak. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to break the array here!”</p><p>A young man in blood-red clothes and carrying a blood-red sword on his back said coldly from the crowd of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>His name was the seventh Blood Sword, and he was ranked higher than the little demon Lord on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>that’s right. If we can catch one of the 13 candidates, the possibility of cracking the seal will increase greatly!</p><p>One of the sky demon Valley’s elites said as he licked his lips.</p><p>I don’t know where those guys are. I haven’t seen a single one these days! The seventh Blood Sword said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>As for the talisman sect disciples who were killed while breaking the array, they were unconcerned. They even thought that the other party was trash who couldn’t even break the array.</p><p>The few of them were chatting when suddenly, their expressions changed and they looked towards the eastern sky.</p><p>Three beams of light flew over. When the light dispersed, three figures appeared.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, hai Fei, and Liu Guang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you, you piece of trash!”</p><p>The little demon Lord Luo Li was the first to speak, his eyes filled with anger.</p><p>Previously, he had been injured by Lu Ming’s puppet. He had wanted to tear Lu Ming’s bones apart. He had never expected that Lu Ming would suddenly appear here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him. There are two Talisman Amulet sect disciples with him!”</p><p>“Haha, there’s actually someone who delivered himself to my door!”</p><p>The others all called out.</p><p>This was especially so for the Supreme talents of the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley. They looked at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>There would be a huge reward for killing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, what are you doing here? They want to capture our Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples to help them break the formation. Hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, Bai chixue cried out, looking anxious.</p><p>There were too many paragons from the three forces here. They were too powerful. No matter how powerful Lu Ming was, he was no match for them.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at Bai chixue and glanced around. A murderous look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the Supreme talents of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley moved. They appeared around Lu Ming and vaguely cut off his escape route.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll see where you can run to this time. If I don’t skin you alive, I’m not called Luo Li!</p><p>The little demon Lord looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Didn’t you want to break the formation here? I’ll help you break it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he glanced at the little demon Lord.</p><p>“You can break it?”</p><p>The seventh Blood sword’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his palm and a ball of purple mental energy fire danced in his palm.</p><p>“A seventh-rank Alchemist!” He exclaimed.</p><p>More people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“How is it? I’ll help you break the array, but I have a condition. Release the other talisman sect disciples!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Let them go? That’s impossible. Lu Ming, what right do you have to negotiate with us?”</p><p>The little demon Lord said coldly.</p><p>haha, not bad. This Lu Ming is really an idiot. He actually delivered himself to our door. Just in time, we’ll take you down. You’ll still have to obediently help us break the array!</p><p>A young man on Lu Ming’s right sneered.</p><p>This young man was called Quan Fei. He was also a peerless heaven’s pride of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, ranked 109th on the list of top 1000 talents. Now, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the first level of the spirit embryo realm. He was extremely powerful. Even though Lu Ming was a seventh rank Alchemist, he was not afraid at all. He took large strides forward and closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Obediently surrender and help us break the formation!”</p><p>Quan Fei laughed coldly and strode forward, sending a palm strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>This palm was extremely powerful. The huge palm force locked onto Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and looked at him coldly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming roared and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth rumbled and the palm force that flew out collapsed instantly. Then, Lu Ming slapped out.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A slap landed directly on Quan Fei’s face. Quan Fei let out a blood-curdling screech and was sent flying a few thousand meters away like a broken sack. He crashed heavily onto the ground and twitched non-stop.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard as everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>A single slap had actually sent Quan Fei, who was at the peak of the first level of the spirit embryo realm, flying. How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so strong?</p><p>Although he had been careless and did not use the blood Meridian fusion, Lu Ming’s combat strength was still terrifying.</p><p>how dare you injure the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? I’ll cripple you now!</p><p>The little demonic Lord was furious. Demonic Qi surged from his body. He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. He waved his palm in the air, and a terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He was not afraid at all. He immediately burst out with dragon energy. His body was covered in a layer of scales as he threw a punch forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist radiance and the saber radiance collided, causing a violent boom. Lu Ming and the little demon Lord both took three steps back.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The little demon Lord roared in disbelief.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would be able to force him to retreat with one move.</p><p>Even though he did not use his full strength in the attack just now.</p><p>“Fourth level spirit embryo realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The little demon Lord Luo Li was stronger than the last time. He had broken through a level and reached the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm, two levels higher than Lu Ming.</p><p>However, even if it was two levels higher, so what? Lu Ming was still confident.</p><p>Around him, Blood Sword seven, Blood Sword nine, and brother Li Tian, the leaving fire sword, all the elites of the sky demon Valley, looked grave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their imagination.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
