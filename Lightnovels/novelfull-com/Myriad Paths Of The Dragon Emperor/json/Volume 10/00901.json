Other than shock, there was also joy in his eyes.</p><p>...</p><p>It could really be refined.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that other than energy such as blood essence, fresh blood, and vital essence that could be refined, intent runes could also be refined.</p><p>Although the intent runes could not be completely refined and a large part would be lost in the process of refining, there was still a part that was integrated into Lu Ming’s own intent runes. In an instant, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the intent increased by leaps and bounds, and he improved rapidly.</p><p>This feeling was extremely profound and difficult to describe in words.</p><p>After refining all the intent runes of the death Warriors, his Wind and Fire intents had improved greatly.</p><p>Since he had not comprehended the water concept, Lu Ming made the water concept runes dissipate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current mood could only be described as ecstatic. He could even devour intent runes and turn them into his own. In the future, his cultivation would improve by leaps and bounds.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but burst out laughing.</p><p>So what if he had comprehended many intent realms? The more he comprehended, the faster he could improve.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to race. He was thinking if he should comprehend other concepts. Otherwise, it would be a waste if he devoured them.</p><p>forget it. I’ll wait for a while. It’s not wise to comprehend a new Intent right now. It’ll hinder my cultivation speed. I’ll consider it after the battle of Providence is over!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p>Now was not the time to be impulsive. There were great opportunities in the battle of Providence. In such an environment, other people’s cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds. However, if he comprehended a new Intent realm now, his cultivation would not improve for a period of time even with the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>In the battle of Providence, it was not wise to fall behind by one step.</p><p>“What is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately began to observe.</p><p>He flew high into the sky and looked around. All around him were mountains and ancient trees.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and flew forward.</p><p>“Eh? There’s quite a lot of spirit herbs here!”</p><p>After flying for some time, Lu Ming discovered a few stalks of spiritual medicine growing on a cliff.</p><p>There were three of them in total, and they were the superior-grade six-grade spirit medicine, returning origin grass.</p><p>Lu Ming flew down and waved his hand. His essential core rolled out and he plucked the three returning origin herbs.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming plucked the returning origin grass, a light suddenly flashed in front of him. Then, a Jade book condensed and formed.</p><p>This Jade book only had two pages, and there was a line of words on the surface: 3 points.</p><p>“This is the Book of Destiny!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he was secretly amazed.</p><p>It was said that the battle of Providence was extremely mysterious. The first year was a time to search for opportunities to improve one’s cultivation and also a time to accumulate Providence.</p><p>Yes, to accumulate fate.</p><p>During the battle of Providence, if one could find ruins, treasures, or inheritances of experts, not only would they obtain great opportunities, but they would also obtain Providence.</p><p>During this period, even if you found a spiritual herb or a precious material, it would accumulate fate.</p><p>Some people were lucky and could casually find a treasure trove, obtain a legacy, and obtain a massive amount of fate.</p><p>Every person who participated in the battle of Providence would obtain a book of Providence the first time they obtained Providence. The amount of Providence one had accumulated, whether it was strong or weak, would all be converted into Providence value, which would be displayed on the book of Providence. It was truly a miraculous sight.</p><p>It was said that luck was not only useful for one’s own body, but also for one’s family and friends if one obtained enough luck. It could make their luck and even their talent stronger.</p><p>It would also be of great use to the sect they were in. It was said that the sect master of the sect would be the one who would receive the most benefits.</p><p>This was also why the major forces attached great importance to the battle of Providence. They did not hesitate to open all the cultivation Holy Lands to cultivate young geniuses.</p><p>Luck was a mysterious thing, but it was extremely wonderful. In short, it had endless wonderful uses, and the more the better.</p><p>Some people guessed that it might be a type of energy, an extremely mysterious energy.</p><p>Furthermore, if you killed the person who had accumulated fate, you could also take a portion of the fate from him.</p><p>Therefore, in the battle for Providence, bloody massacres were bound to happen in the end to seize the Providence of others.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud noise came from the front. It seemed that someone was fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and rushed over.</p><p>When he was not far away, Lu Ming rushed up a big tree and hid between the branches, looking ahead.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly shrank when he saw it. He was shocked.</p><p>In front of them were two burly beings covered in black scales. They were attacking a human heaven’s favorite.</p><p>There were two horns on the heads of the two creatures and an eye in the middle of their brows.</p><p>Lu Ming was all too familiar with this kind of living being.</p><p>Three-eyed God race!</p><p>This was the three-eyed God that Lu Ming had encountered on the small island when he first entered the heaven realm.</p><p>How was this possible? Why would they encounter a three-eyed God here? Could this place be the heaven realm?</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>The two three-eyed gods were at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm, while the human was at the fifth level. He was no match for the two three-eyed gods. He roared in anger, but it was useless and he was completely suppressed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Two beams of light shot out from the third eye of the two three-eyed God race beings.</p><p>One was a beam of lightning, and the other was a beam of fire. The two beams of light pierced through the void and killed the sovereign.</p><p>Lu Ming did not appear to save her.</p><p>Unless it was someone from the talisman sect, two of the other three forces wanted to kill Lu Ming. The other was the heavenly corpse sect, which also had a great grudge against Lu Ming. Why would Lu Ming take action?</p><p>these humans have appeared again. They appear once every 20 years. Let’s go back and report to the captain!</p><p>One of the three-eyed gods said.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two three-eyed God race beings then rose into the air and left.</p><p>Lu Ming flew out and his devouring power erupted, devouring the human’s energy.</p><p>from their tone, the three-eyed God race should be stationed here and should be very familiar with this area. If I want to search for treasures or the abodes of experts, I don’t know how long I’ll have to charge in blindly by myself. Obtaining information from these three-eyed God race members is the best choice!</p><p>With that thought in mind, Lu Ming’s body moved and he chased after the two three-eyed gods.</p><p>Ten thousand miles later, Lu Ming saw other three-eyed gods in a forest. There were a total of eleven of them, and it was clear that they were a small team.</p><p>The two three-eyed gods from before were currently reporting something to an especially muscular three-eyed God.</p><p>the strongest one should be at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm. Kill!</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and he dashed out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, more than ten Spears materialized and shot toward the three-eyed God.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Immediately, seven of the weaker three-eyed gods were pierced by Lu Ming’s spear and killed.</p><p>There were four more, two at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean tier and two at the eighth level. Their reactions were slightly faster, and they dodged the spear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
