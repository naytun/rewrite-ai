One month, two months …</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how much time had passed. He only knew that there was a war. A Great War.</p><p>He was fighting with more than a dozen spirit gods.</p><p>His will was incomparably firm. No matter how it was shattered, he could recover. It was as firm as a rock and there was nothing that could stop him.</p><p>The dozen or so spiritual gods were defeated and scattered by Lu Ming one after another. The amazing thing was that the intent of the spiritual gods would integrate into Lu Ming’s intent rune. His understanding of a certain intent rune would be greatly improved.</p><p>There were more than a dozen spiritual gods, and they contained all kinds of intents.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not know when, but there was only one spiritual God left in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>this spiritual God has comprehended the earth essence realm. What a strong defense!</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>This spiritual God was protected by the intent of earth and was like a turtle shell. It was the most difficult to deal with.</p><p>Lu Ming and the spiritual God continued to fight. Slowly, three days passed. Finally, Lu Ming broke through the defense and defeated the spiritual God.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his earth concept had improved a lot.</p><p>haha, that old three-eyed God was trying to harm me, but who would’ve thought that he’d help me instead? my four intents have all improved by a huge margin!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. With a thought, he returned to his body.</p><p>He found that he was still holding the totem pole and standing there.</p><p>I don’t even know how long I’ve been fighting with those spiritual gods. It feels like a long time has passed. However, the battle of Kismet shouldn’t be over yet. Otherwise, I would have been teleported out!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Eh? My cultivation level?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>He sensed it and immediately found that the true Qi in his body was surging and extremely strong. It was much stronger than before.</p><p>seventh level of the spirit embryo realm! This is the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had only killed a dozen or so spiritual gods in his sea of consciousness, but his cultivation had actually increased by three levels, from the fourth level spirit embryo realm to the early stage of the seventh level spirit embryo realm. This was simply inconceivable.</p><p>“Take a look at my intent realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he was overjoyed.</p><p>His wind, fire, and lightning intents had all reached the peak of level three upper tier. He was only one step away from the completion of level three.</p><p>The earth intent was slightly weaker, but it had also reached the late stage of level three upper tier.</p><p>It had improved too much.</p><p>“How long has it been? My cultivation base has actually improved so much? It’s too shocking!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly. At the same time, he was extremely happy.</p><p>This was an opportunity, a great opportunity.</p><p>what a powerful force. With my current combat strength, I can definitely kill Luo Tian easily!</p><p>Lu Ming felt the majestic energy in his body and his eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Of course, he was referring to the Luo Tian of the past. He did not know how much time had passed and whether Luo Tian’s cultivation had improved.</p><p>“There’s something down there!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there was something strange under the totem pole.</p><p>With a thought, the totem pole was kept into his storage ring.</p><p>There was a pit where the totem pole had been pulled out. Under the pit, a piece of iron with strange patterns could be seen.</p><p>The iron block seemed to be very large, and only a part of it was exposed in the pit. The rest of it was covered by rocks on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming pried open the rock and realized that it was not an iron block but a huge iron box. Lu Ming took out the iron box.</p><p>What was in this metal box?</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious and opened the metal box.</p><p>In the iron box, there were two jade figures that were as tall as humans. Yes, jade figures, as if they were carved out of huge precious Jade.</p><p>The Jade figure emitted a shocking amount of life essence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted sharply. He thought of a kind of treasure, heaven and earth Jade essence!</p><p>That’s right, this wasn’t a Jade person sculpted from Jade, but a heaven and earth Jade essence.</p><p>The heaven and earth Jade essence was said to be a type of Supreme Jade. After countless years, it absorbed the essence of heaven and earth and was born by chance.</p><p>If this kind of living being completely awakens its intelligence and is born, it will be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Legend had it that a long time ago, a mature heaven and earth Jade essence was born in the eastern wilderness. It was extremely terrifying and invincible. It could compete with or even be stronger than a Martial Emperor.</p><p>He had stirred up a storm of blood in the East continent and was killed by a stronger being.</p><p>It was extremely difficult for this heaven and earth Jade essence to fully mature. Once it matured, it would be invincible in the world. However, a Jade essence that had not matured and had not awakened its spiritual wisdom was a rare Supreme treasure.</p><p>It could really be described as rare.</p><p>This was because a heaven and earth Jade essence, combined with some other materials, could be used to refine a perfect body.</p><p>If a spiritual God Realm master’s life was coming to an end, he could attach his spiritual God to the body refined by the heaven and earth Jade and live another life.</p><p>How precious was this?</p><p>Lu Ming actually obtained two here. His heart was beating rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, he thought of the nine suns Paragon. If the nine suns Paragon had this heaven and earth Jade essence, he could completely reform his physical body and return to the world.</p><p>That’s great!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart was filled with excitement. He was ten times, no, a hundred times more excited than when he found out that his cultivation had improved greatly.</p><p>Along the way, the nine suns Supreme had helped him too much. His current achievements were all because of the nine suns Supreme. Otherwise, he would still be a piece of trash who had his bloodline taken away from the Lu family of the fiery wind city of the blazing sun Empire. He might have been killed by someone else long ago.</p><p>There was one thing that had always been on his mind, and that was to find a treasure for nine suns Supreme to form a new physical body. Now, he had finally found it.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed his excited mood.</p><p>“And a jade talisman!”</p><p>Lu Ming found a jade talisman beside the two heaven and earth Jade spirits.</p><p>Lu Ming picked it up and took a look. He knew that it was a kind of secret book that recorded cultivation techniques or Jade talismans that recorded things.</p><p>With a sweep of his mind, Lu Ming realized that this was a secret skill.</p><p>Twin forbidden spell!</p><p>This was the name of the secret skill.</p><p>What a strange name. Lu Ming began to read the content.</p><p>At one glance, Lu Ming was shocked and his eyes widened.</p><p>what a wonderful secret skill! What a strange secret skill! What a shocking secret skill!</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed continuously.</p><p>According to the records of the Twin forbidden spell, this secret skill could actually cultivate one person into two.</p><p>That’s right, there was a huge difference between cultivating two people and cultivating a clone.</p><p>Using the heaven and earth Jade essence as the material, one’s soul would be split into two and another one would be formed.</p><p>This self would become the second body, while the main body would be the main body.</p><p>This was completely different from a clone.</p><p>This was because, generally speaking, a clone could only have a portion of the original’s combat strength and could not cultivate. The strength it had when it was cultivated would always be the same.</p><p>However, the Twin forbidden spell was different. The clone he condensed was basically the same as the main body. They had the same strength and aura. They could even cultivate, comprehend, and even communicate with each other.</p><p>This was terrifying and heaven-defying.</p><p>This was equivalent to two people cultivating.</p><p>The only difference was that the clone had no consciousness. It was controlled by the main body and had no distracting thoughts. It would only focus on cultivation.</p><p>This was simply faster than the cultivation of the main body.</p><p>Moreover, if the main body accidentally died, the consciousness could awaken in the secondary body. This was equivalent to having an extra life. How heaven-defying was this?</p><p>However, there was a warning at the end of the forbidden twin chant. This was a forbidden technique that could only be used once in a lifetime. Otherwise, it would lead to self-destruction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
