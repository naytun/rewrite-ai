Lu Ming roared. He took a step forward and rushed toward di Shen like the wind.</p><p>At the same time, the formation on the fighting ring glowed. Long Spears were formed one after another, emitting a terrifying aura. They pierced toward the Emperor God.</p><p>In the previous battle with the Emperor God, although it was impossible to concentrate on carving the formation, how could it be weak after spending more than 20 minutes in the battle?</p><p>In addition, with the various supplementary arrays, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were extremely gloomy. He kept slashing out his sword, clashing with the long spear formed by the formation.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and struck the Emperor God’s sword with his palm. The Emperor God trembled and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and kept launching attacks. At the same time, the formation glowed and kept condensing long Spears to attack the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God couldn’t fight back and kept retreating.</p><p>He was at a disadvantage.</p><p>He had unleashed three types of concepts and his attack power was unparalleled. However, he was still no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Most importantly, his will of space was still at the complete stage of level three, while the other two had reached level four. It was difficult for him to unleash the full power of his will.</p><p>He roared and fought with all his might, but he was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>“I’ll let you have a taste of the prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming transformed into the prison-suppressing stele and suppressed the Emperor God.</p><p>The bloodline power of the nine Dragons had been used up, but the bloodline power of the prison-suppressing stele was still there.</p><p>The crowd was numb. Many people already knew that Lu Ming had two divine level bloodlines, so they were not too shocked.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Emperor God was hit by the prison-suppressing stele. His body trembled and he was knocked back. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele glowed and continued to suppress the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God’s face was gloomy. He took a step forward and disappeared in an instant, reappearing in another place 100 meters away.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and continued to press down on the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God did not dare to take the attack head-on. He could only continue to use teleport, his figure constantly changing to avoid Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>This scene caused the expressions of the people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to turn extremely ugly.</p><p>In this way, the Emperor God was at a disadvantage. Once half an hour was up, the ancient city of Providence would automatically determine that the Emperor God had failed.</p><p>Of course, this was still better than admitting defeat. If he admitted defeat, he would lose 90% of his fate value, while if he lost, he would only lose half of his fate value.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s face darkened.</p><p>The destiny that he obtained in every Battle of Destiny was very important to him. However, it seemed like he was going to fail this time. The first place might fall to Lu Ming and the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“God Emperor, weren’t you very arrogant just now? now you can only run away? Is this the number one on the list of top 1000 talents?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and mocked.</p><p>The Emperor God gritted his teeth, and the flames of anger in his eyes seemed to be burning.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll definitely kill you with my own hands in the future!”</p><p>Di Yi’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>haha, di Shen, let me tell you. You’ve lost to me today, but you’ll never be my match in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>The Emperor God clenched his fists so hard that his knuckles cracked. He was greatly shocked.</p><p>This was because he had always been the one saying this to others in the past.</p><p>In the past, he was ranked first on the list of top 1000 talents. He was high and mighty with unparalleled talent. Anyone who was defeated by him would never be his opponent in the future, because he improved faster than others and the gap between him and the others would only grow wider.</p><p>He had never thought that these words would come from someone else’s mouth, and that the target would be him.</p><p>However, he was helpless now. The power of his Blood Meridian had been exhausted and he could not block Lu Ming’s attack at all. He could only use blink to Dodge.</p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the fighting ring shook and two beams of light enveloped Lu Ming and the Emperor God.</p><p>The time was up, and the two of them fought for a full half an hour.</p><p>When the time was up, the battle ended.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk rapidly and transformed into Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The fate Dragon above Lu Ming’s head roared and gnawed at the fate Dragon above di Shen’s head. In the end, it devoured half of di Shen’s fate.</p><p>The Emperor God’s fate was now more than 1300 feet.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s fate Dragon expanded rapidly and finally exceeded four thousand feet.</p><p>The fate Dragon, which was more than four thousand feet long, floated above Lu Ming’s head, just like a real Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming won. Haha, Lu Ming is in first place!</p><p>Fatty was the first to shout out in excitement.</p><p>“Lu Ming is first!”</p><p>Then, Bai chixue, ruan Tingting, and the others also started to shout and cheer.</p><p>Even Huan Zhen, Wen zhishi, and the others were extremely excited.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. I’m not as good as him!”</p><p>Huan Zhen sighed, but he didn’t look unhappy. Instead, his eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>“We were competing with Lu Ming before this?”</p><p>Ji mai, Meng Jia, and the others looked at each other and smiled bitterly.</p><p>They felt a vague sense of pride in their hearts. They had been Lu Ming’s opponents.</p><p>At this moment, even Bai Shijin, du songjue, Meng Chong, and the others were extremely excited.</p><p>Lu Ming had won first place and his fate Dragon was more than four thousand feet long. How shocking was this?</p><p>There was no doubt that the talisman sect was ranked first in the overall ranking of this Battle of Destiny.</p><p>How many years had it been? Ever since Lian Cang’s disappearance, the talisman sect had been on a decline. They had never gotten first place before, but now they had gotten first place again.</p><p>This time, the talisman Amulet sect would definitely obtain great fortune. Perhaps, there was hope for its revival.</p><p>How could they not be excited?</p><p>In the past, the condition that they put forward to Lu Ming was for him to win first place in the battle of Providence. However, in their hearts, no one actually thought that Lu Ming could do it. They were just giving him pressure.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming could really do it.</p><p>As for the people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley, they all had different expressions.</p><p>But most of them were shocked.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence started, who would have guessed that Lu Ming would actually get first place?</p><p>At that time, both the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley wanted to kill Lu Ming. Most of them thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. However, Lu Ming created a miracle later on and even defeated the Emperor God to win the first place.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>The Masters of the Wang and Jiang families were filled with killing intent as they roared in their hearts.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi didn’t say a word, but his eyes shot out a cold light.</p><p>“Hehe, this little guy is really unexpected.”</p><p>In the sky demon Valley, the demon Emperor’s charming voice made many people’s hearts beat faster.</p><p>“It’s indeed unexpected!”</p><p>The corpse Emperor’s ear-piercing voice was the complete opposite of the demon Emperor’s.</p><p>The eyes of ao tu, Xue Jianyi, Feng Xuan, and the others were filled with a shocking fighting spirit. They knew that from now on, they would have a powerful opponent on their way to rise.</p><p>This opponent gave them immense pressure.</p><p>At this moment, the light pillar that enveloped Lu Ming suddenly shone brightly. Then, a token appeared out of nowhere and descended from the sky, flying toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
