His body was in tatters and blood was flowing out.</p><p>On the black-robed young man’s shoulder was a little turtle, its claws gripping tightly onto the young man’s shoulder. Its eyes were rolled back, and its body was twitching.</p><p>...</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black-robed young man’s speed was extremely fast. He rushed out of the forest and then fell heavily to the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust. Then, he just lay there.</p><p>“Dandan, I was almost killed by you this time!”</p><p>The young man lying on the ground said weakly.</p><p>This young man was Lu Ming, who had crossed the chaos realm.</p><p>At this moment, another seven days had passed since Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline had leveled up. Just as they were about to cross the mountain range and enter the central continent, they encountered a powerful beast. It was a second tier eighth level beast, equivalent to a second level spiritual God.</p><p>Originally, they could’ve gone around this beast, but they just happened to discover that this beast was guarding two Holy Spirit ginseng.</p><p>These two Saint spiritual ginsengs were the highest grade of level eight spiritual herbs. Even a peak spiritual God would be moved by them.</p><p>Therefore, dandan was tempted. She secretly went to dig up the two Holy Spirit ginseng but was discovered by the powerful beast. The beast went crazy and chased after dandan. In the end, even Lu Ming was implicated.</p><p>Lu Ming had used all his means to escape from the ferocious beast’s demonic claws. However, he had also suffered severe injuries. Many of his bones were broken and his internal organs were injured. There was not much vital energy left and his breathing was extremely weak.</p><p>Dandan wasn’t any better. After being hit by the fierce beast a few times, she was almost blown apart. At this time, her whole body was twitching non-stop.</p><p>Spiritual God-level existences were too powerful. Lu Ming was not their match at all.</p><p>Take the human race’s martial artists as an example. Those who could step into the spiritual God Realm were at least divine level prodigies. Most of them had awakened the second class divine level, and some had even awakened the third class divine level or above bloodline.</p><p>It was no problem for such a prodigy to cross two to three realms to fight an enemy in the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>It was the same for fierce beasts and demonic beasts. They all had a few percent of the bloodline of a divine beast in their bodies, and they were extremely powerful.</p><p>In addition, there was a huge chasm between the spirit embryo realm and the spiritual God Realm. Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, so it was difficult for him to cross such a huge gap.</p><p>During the war of Providence, the three-eyed God race fought for the last totem pillar in the three-eyed God race’s Royal City. The reason why the Emperor God and the others were able to stop the three-eyed God race’s most powerful being was that the three-eyed God race’s expert had yet to fully enter the spiritual God Realm. He was only half a step into the spiritual God Realm, which was why the Emperor God and the others were able to fight him.</p><p>In that world, the three-eyed God race would be suppressed by the laws of that world the moment they entered the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>If he was a spiritual God expert, the divine Emperor and the others would not have been able to stop him.</p><p>Furthermore, the ferocious beast that Lu Ming had faced previously was equivalent to a second level spiritual God Realm, which was even more powerful. It was already very difficult for Lu Ming to escape with his life.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t blame me. We’ll each take one of the two Holy Spirit ginsengs!”</p><p>Dandan’s body twitched as she spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to say anything more to eggy. He just lay there, closed his eyes, and channeled his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>Not far away, two young women were watching curiously.</p><p>“Lei, there’s still some sound. He doesn’t seem to be dead. Let’s go and take a look. See if we can help him!”</p><p>Said a-Qing.</p><p>“Yes, a-Qing, be careful!”</p><p>In comparison, miss ah Lei was more timid and shy.</p><p>The two young ladies approached Lu Ming carefully. When they saw that Lu Ming’s eyes were closed and his body was covered in blood, a hint of pity flashed in their eyes.</p><p>he seems to be seriously injured, but he’s still breathing. He seems to be unconscious. Why don’t we carry him back to the city? if he’s left here alone, he’ll definitely be eaten by the beasts!</p><p>“Mm, sure!”</p><p>Ah Lei nodded.</p><p>The two young ladies were kind-hearted and they walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes. The two young ladies shrieked in fear and retreated hurriedly, their faces as white as snow.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. These two young ladies were really timid. However, Lu Ming was a little surprised that they dared to come to this dangerous mountain range.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid, I have no ill intentions!”</p><p>Lu Ming forced himself to stand up and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming used his mind to scan the area and realized that the two young ladies ‘cultivation levels were at the perfected spiritual ocean realm. They could be considered geniuses in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>don’t be afraid, Lei. His cultivation is probably not as good as ours!</p><p>A-Qing said in a small voice.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura was extremely weak. He gave off the feeling that his cultivation level was indeed low and he was not even comparable to the two young ladies.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard this but he did not defend himself.</p><p>“Were you injured by a demonic beast in the mountain range? With your cultivation level, you still dare to go deeper than us. Don’t you know it’s very dangerous?”</p><p>Miss a-Qing blinked her eyes and said.</p><p>“I have no other choice but to go deep into the mountains!”</p><p>Lu Ming casually gave a reason.</p><p>“Oh, it seems like you’ve entered the mountains for an important matter just like us. En, do you know why that level 8 vicious beast went crazy?”</p><p>A-Qing asked curiously.</p><p>Naturally, she did not expect that the level-eight beast’s rage was because of Lu Ming. She thought that Lu Ming had been injured by other weaker beasts.</p><p>“I don’t know either!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“Well, forget it. I see that you are quite seriously injured. Where are you from? Do you need us to send you back?”</p><p>A-Qing asked.</p><p>After chatting for a while, the two young ladies felt that Lu Ming did not seem to be a bad person. They became bolder and walked closer to Lu Ming to chat with him.</p><p>“My home is far from here, I’m afraid I can’t go back for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Oh, in that case, why don’t you come with us to the Lishui City first? it’s the closest to here, so you can go there to recuperate. It’s still not safe here, and I don’t know if the beast will go crazy again!”</p><p>A-Qing said.</p><p>“Good! Thank you both!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s first time in the central continent. He was unfamiliar with the people and the place. He really needed to find a place to stay temporarily and understand the situation in the central continent before making his next plans.</p><p>Moreover, he could also find a place to recuperate, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>A-Qing asked.</p><p>“I’m lu Shaoqing. May I know your names?”</p><p>Lu Ming casually said a name.</p><p>There were probably spies from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the central continent. Lu Ming did not intend to use his real name.</p><p>“I’m Xiao Yi, you can call me ah Yi. This is my sister Xiao Lei, you can call her ah Lei!”</p><p>A-Qing said.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that a ‘an was lively, cheerful, and talkative. On the other hand, a’ Lei was a lot more shy. She did not talk much and only sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>Hearing ah Luo’s words, ah Lei whispered, ” “I’m clearly the older sister!”</p><p>Ah Luo glared at her. ah Lei, you’re talking nonsense. I’m clearly your sister. I’ve always been the one taking care of you!</p><p>“But Grandpa said I was born a moment earlier than you!” Ah Lei retorted in a low voice.</p><p>Grandpa, that’s nonsense. Hmph, I don’t care. I’m the older sister. Lu Shaoqing, just remember that I’m the older sister!</p><p>A-Qing pouted.</p><p>Lu Ming found it a little funny. These two young girls were really naive and did not have many schemes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
