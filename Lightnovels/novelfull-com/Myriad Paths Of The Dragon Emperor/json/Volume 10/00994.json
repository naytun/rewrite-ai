He wanted to give us to Ling yunkong for his own future.”</p><p>An ‘an wiped her tears and explained to Lu Ming.</p><p>It turned out that Xiao ning was also a disciple of the floating mountain martial school. However, the floating mountain martial school was a Colossus with many geniuses and geniuses. Desolate ning’s talent was average. He was just an ordinary disciple in the floating mountain sect and was not valued at all.</p><p>However, he knew how to conduct himself and flatter others. He had used some unknown method to befriend Ling yunkong, one of the ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain sect, and had even run errands for Ling yunkong.</p><p>Once, Xiao ning brought Ling yunkong to the Xiao family as a guest. The entire Xiao family was shocked and threw a huge banquet to welcome Ling yunkong.</p><p>At the banquet, Ling yunkong had his eyes on the two sisters, ah Lei and ah Luo.</p><p>For such a good thing, Xiao ning would naturally help to introduce him.</p><p>Ling yunkong, the peerless heaven’s pride expert of the floating mountain martial school. Even in the battle of Providence in the central continent, he had achieved extraordinary results. Which young girl wouldn’t like heaven’s pride experts and worship peerless geniuses?</p><p>A ‘ke and a’ Lei naturally agreed to be acquainted with Ling yunkong.</p><p>However, he later found out that Ling yunkong actually wanted to marry both of them. Yes, both of them.</p><p>This made the two sisters a ‘Lei and a’ ke very disappointed in Ling yunkong. Later on, they found out that Ling yunkong was not a reliable person. He had already married seven to eight concubines. In this case, the two sisters would naturally not agree to it.</p><p>However, Xiao ning had finally managed to climb up to Ling yunkong’s high position. How could he miss out on such a rare opportunity?</p><p>As long as Ling yunkong married these two beautiful sisters, he would definitely reward him handsomely and value him even more in the future. Then, he, desolate ning, would be able to rise up the ranks in the floating mountain sect.</p><p>Therefore, Xiao ning and Xiao Hongyun had been trying their best to marry the two sisters to Ling yunkong. However, the old man of the Xiao family, Xiao Zhan, was strongly against it. Thus, this matter had been dragged on.</p><p>Now that Xiao Zhan was poisoned and unconscious, how could Xiao ning and Xiao Hongyun miss this opportunity? naturally, they began to urge the two sisters to marry Ling yunkong.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and came to a sudden realization.</p><p>No wonder the two sisters had such a bad relationship with Xiao ning. So this was the reason.</p><p>The three of them chatted and then returned to their rooms.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning walked around a few courtyards and chatted with each other.</p><p>“Father, why did you agree to let that brat cure grandpa’s poison? if that brat really cured grandpa’s poison, with his bad temper, he would definitely object to us giving the two girls, ah Zhen and ah Lei, to Ling yunkong.”</p><p>Desolate ning said anxiously.</p><p>“Why are you so anxious? The seven-colored poisonous snake is extremely rare and its poison is very special. Now, the poison has spread to the old man’s body, penetrating into his muscles, bones, and blood. We’ve invited so many alchemists and pharmacists, but none of them could do anything. How could that brat detoxify the poison? in my opinion, that brat has taken a fancy to a ‘Zhen and a’ Zhen, and he just wants to show off in front of them.”</p><p>“When he fails to detoxify the poison tomorrow, we’ll find a reason to kick him out of the Xiao family!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said.</p><p>“Father is right!”</p><p>Desolate ning revealed a happy smile.</p><p>……</p><p>The day passed quickly, and the next day, the poison in old master Xiao showed no signs of subsiding.</p><p>The next afternoon, Lu Ming, the sisters, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning, went to old master Xiao’s room together.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door and saw an old man lying on the bed.</p><p>The old man looked to be in his 60s and had a burly figure, but his aura was weak now.</p><p>His body was covered with multicolored spots. The seven colors covered his entire body, making him look extremely strange.</p><p>This was the poison of the poisonous Rainbow Snake.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Seeing Xiao Zhan’s appearance, the sisters felt a great pain in their hearts. Their eyes turned red and tears flowed down uncontrollably.</p><p>the poisonous Rainbow snake’s poison has spread to every part of his body. It’s even in his muscles, bones, and blood!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>The old man was deeply poisoned. If not for his profound cultivation, he would have died long ago. Even so, he would not be able to hold on for long. Lu Ming predicted that the old man would die from the poison in a month at most.</p><p>big brother Lu, are you confident that you can save my grandfather? ”</p><p>A-Qing said with a sobbing tone.</p><p>“I’ll try my best!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and walked over.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming’s true energy spread out and supported Xiao Zhan’s body. Xiao Zhan sat up on the bed, and Lu Ming sat cross-legged behind him. His palm was on Xiao Zhan’s back, and the devouring power suddenly burst out.</p><p>The devouring power wrapped around Xiao Zhan’s body and seeped into every inch of his skin, bones, flesh, and blood.</p><p>The sisters, ah Luo and ah Lei, as well as Xiao Hongyun and his son, were all staring at Lu Ming nervously.</p><p>However, the four of them were nervous about different things.</p><p>Ah Luo and ah Lei were nervous because they were afraid that Lu Ming could not cure Xiao Zhan’s poison.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and his son were nervous because they were afraid that Lu Ming had cured Xiao Zhan of his poison.</p><p>“The poisone … The poisoner’s starting to get rid of the poison!”</p><p>Suddenly, a ‘an’s eyes lit up and she said in a trembling voice.</p><p>First of all, the multicolored spots on Xiao Zhan’s face began to fade, as if something was sucking them out of his body.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning’s expressions changed drastically, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming could really cure Xiao Zhan’s poison?</p><p>The eyes of the two of them flashed with all kinds of glints, and they were a little cold.</p><p>The sisters, ah Luo and ah Lei, were overjoyed. They clasped their hands tightly together and looked at Lu Ming and Xiao Zhan with hope.</p><p>As time passed, the colors on Xiao Zhan’s face became more and more faint, and the aura on Xiao Zhan’s body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Half an hour later, all the colors on Xiao Zhan’s face had disappeared.</p><p>The other colorful spots on his body also disappeared.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s breathing became even, and he could even hear the thumping of his heart.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh and stopped devouring.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s poison was unexpectedly difficult to detoxify. It had penetrated into every inch of his flesh and blood. Even with the devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline, it took him half an hour.</p><p>But in the end, Xiao Zhan’s poison had been completely devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons and refined into nothing.</p><p>“Big brother Lu, my grandfather’s poison …”</p><p>A-Qing asked with some concern.</p><p>“Your grandfather’s poison has been completely removed by me, and he’ll wake up soon. However, senior Xiao has been poisoned for so many days, and his body is very weak. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for him to recover to his peak in a short time. He’ll need some time to recuperate!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“The poison is cured? That’s great, that’s great, the poison is cured, thank you, big brother Lu!”</p><p>A-Qing smiled and was extremely excited.</p><p>Ah Lei was the same, her eyes filled with joy.</p><p>However, Xiao Hongyun and his son were the complete opposite. There was not a trace of a smile in their eyes, and their eyes were very gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and got off the bed.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Zhan’s body suddenly trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He then slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>“Grandpa is awake, Grandpa is awake! Grandpa!”</p><p>Ah Luo was so excited that she almost jumped up and ran to the bed with ah Lei.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
