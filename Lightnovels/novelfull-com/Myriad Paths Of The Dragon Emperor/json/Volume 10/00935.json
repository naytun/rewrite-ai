His fists were like two huge iron hammers, constantly bombarding the flaming sword. The flaming sword trembled violently and had no power to fight back.</p><p>...</p><p>At the side, the other members of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace looked at this scene in shock. Their eyes widened and they could not believe it.</p><p>Wang Chen, ranked 43rd on the list of top 1000 talents, had been completely suppressed by Lu Ming. He could not even fight back. Who would have believed it if they had not seen it with their own eyes?</p><p>Back at the ninedragons three sect exchange meet, Lu Ming was indeed very strong. However, there was still a huge gap between him and the top 100. How long had it been since then, and Lu Ming had already reached this stage?</p><p>Everyone in the top hundred was a prodigy among prodigies. Lu Ming had improved, and so had they. It could only be said that Lu Ming’s improvement was too terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The iron fist continued to bombard the flaming sword. Finally, with a loud bang, the flaming sword exploded and turned into flames. The flames drifted back and then condensed back into Wang Chen’s appearance.</p><p>However, the current Wang Chen was in a sorry state. His face was pale and blood was flowing out of his mouth. His aura was weak and it was obvious that he was seriously injured.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming in shock and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and charged forward.</p><p>Today, Wang Chen must die!</p><p>“Nangong Bo, save me!”</p><p>Wang Chen shouted as he retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he continued to charge forward.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>die! a young man shouted coldly. He stepped on the air and pointed his finger. A Phoenix’s cry was heard and a fiery red Phoenix flew out and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He threw a punch and crushed the Phoenix, then continued to attack Wang Chen.</p><p>“How dare you? you don’t seem to have heard what I said.”</p><p>The young man’s eyes were cold and his body glowed. With a tremble, he appeared in front of Wang Chen, his eyes emitting a sharp light.</p><p>A terrifying aura burst forth from his body, far above that of Wang Chen’s.</p><p>Nangong Bo, ranked 32nd on the list of top 1000 talents, was a heaven’s favorite of the Nangong family, one of the six great ancient families.</p><p>“Nangong Bo is about to make his move!”</p><p>In the valley, Wen Zhongli’s eyes turned serious. The spiritual fire between his eyebrows jumped, ready to attack at any time.</p><p>Nangong Bo was not someone Wang Chen could compare to.</p><p>“Nangong Bo, if you block me again, I’ll kill you too!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and pressed forward.</p><p>“Hehe, kill me as well. Let’s see how you’re going to kill me.”</p><p>Nangong Bo’s eyes were cold, and the fiery red light on his body became even stronger. That kind of light seemed like fire, but it wasn’t fire. There seemed to be a Phoenix’s long cry in the light.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix spirit seal was the Nangong family’s strongest technique.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was very simple. He threw a punch.</p><p>Nangong Bo struck out with his palm and a Phoenix’s cry rang out. A Phoenix condensed and flew towards Lu Ming. As it flapped its wings, a terrifying killing intent overflowed.</p><p>This was a Phoenix condensed from the blue Phoenix spirit seal. It had terrifying power and looked good, but it was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with the Phoenix without a sound. However, Lu Ming’s expression changed and he could not help but take a few steps back. He felt a tearing pain on his fist.</p><p>He glanced around and found that the scales on his fist had cracked and blood was oozing out.</p><p>What a terrifying Azure Phoenix spirit seal. It was silent and deadly.</p><p>Furthermore, Nangong Bo’s cultivation was also very frightening. He had reached the early stage of the sixth level spirit embryo realm, and his strength was much stronger than Wang Chen.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cry of the phoenix rose again as Nangong Bo stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, another Phoenix flew out, filled with killing intent.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you too!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly and the Dragon energy in his body burst out again.</p><p>With the eruption of five dragon energies, Lu Ming’s strength increased by several times.</p><p>With a single punch, the Phoenix crumbled.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Nangong Bo was shocked. He waved his hands and two phoenixes rushed out. Lu Ming waved his fists, courageous and unrivaled. The true energy in his body whistled, and the four concepts were activated. He circulated the prison-suppressing heaven technique, and its power was extremely strong.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, breaking down madly.</p><p>Nangong Bo’s expression was extremely unsightly. The Phoenix’s cry continued, and his entire body glowed. His fingers continued to form seals in the air, and another Phoenix flew out. This Phoenix seemed to have a breath of life, and its power was even more powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch for a few days. The sky was like a thunderclap. He punched eight times in a row before he finally broke the Phoenix.</p><p>However, Nangong Bo condensed another Phoenix.</p><p>Nangong Bo was indeed very powerful. The heaven’s pride experts who were ranked higher on the list of top 1000 talents would have a higher combat strength than those who were ranked lower on the list, even if they were at the same cultivation level. Otherwise, how could they be ranked at the top?</p><p>Behind Nangong Bo, Wang Chen was overjoyed. With Nangong Bo around, he wouldn’t die.</p><p>A sinister glint flashed in his eyes as he pondered how he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Today, he was actually crushed by the people inside. He had lost a lot of face and must take revenge.</p><p>His eyes flashed as he looked at Wang haoxian. He sneered and flew towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Wang haoxian was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>“Since Lu Ming is so concerned about you, I’ll kill you in front of him. Hehe!”</p><p>Wang Chen sneered. He wanted to kill Wang haoxian in front of Lu Ming and distract Lu Ming so that he would be killed by Nangong Zhan.</p><p>“Wang Chen, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he kept punching. However, Nangong Bo’s combat strength was so strong that he was holding Lu Ming back. For the time being, Lu Ming could not break out.</p><p>“Hehe, I’m indeed anxious!”</p><p>Wang Chen laughed coldly and walked towards Wang haoxian.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the space lit up and countless inscriptions glowed. A formation appeared and several ice dragons formed, pouncing towards Wang Chen.</p><p>“Wen zhishi!”</p><p>Wang Chen was furious. Flames filled the air as he fought the Ice Dragon.</p><p>However, he had been injured by Lu Ming earlier and his combat strength had been weakened. He could not break this array at all.</p><p>Wen zhishi, Gong Fei, and Meng Jia stepped through the air. With every step they took, runes would appear under their feet. Runes would appear in the air.</p><p>“Not good, they’re setting up a formation, stop them!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the side, the other geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace roared. Their true energy exploded and they charged towards Wen Zhongli and the others.</p><p>However, the formation glowed and the ice sword pierced through the air. A few heaven’s favorites screamed as they were killed by the ice sword.</p><p>Wen Qishi, how dare you kill the Supreme talent of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? you must die!</p><p>Nangong Bo bellowed.</p><p>“You should worry about yourself!”</p><p>Nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head. He transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>Nangong Bo’s pupils shrank. A fiery red Phoenix appeared above his head. It was also a level five divine level expert, and he had transformed into a Phoenix.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and the devouring power burst out. He stepped into the void and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>The Phoenix let out a long cry and also used its killer move to fight against the nine Dragons.</p><p>A Dragon and a Phoenix fought in the sky. It was as if they had returned to the ancient times when hundreds of beasts fought for supremacy and the dragon and phoenix fought.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>The more Lu Ming fought, the braver he became. He began to suppress Nangong Bo.</p><p>Phoenixes and true dragons were on the same level, but the nine Dragons were stronger than ordinary true dragons. They were known as the top ten Battle Beasts, the ten most powerful divine beasts in the world, and their battle strength was unparalleled.</p><p>Even if the bloodline level was the same, the nine Dragon bloodline could suppress the Phoenix bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
