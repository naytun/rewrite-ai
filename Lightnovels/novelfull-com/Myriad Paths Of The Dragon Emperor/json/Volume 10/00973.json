Your results are already enough. I believe no one will object to you becoming an official zongzi if you come in second!”</p><p>...</p><p>Bai Shijin said to Lu Ming in a low voice.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. Do your best!”</p><p>Du songjue also warned in a low voice.</p><p>“Seniors, don’t worry. Lu Ming knows what to do!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>It seemed that no one thought that he could win. Bai Shijin and du songjue had said it tactfully, but the meaning was obvious. They all thought that he could not win.</p><p>The feeling of being looked down upon by others was not a good feeling!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>How would he know if he didn’t fight?</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor God also looked at Lu Ming. Then, he stepped forward and landed on the stands.</p><p>There was only one last battle left, but the light of the battle did not fall on Lu Ming and the Emperor God. It was obvious that the ancient city of Providence was very humane and gave the Emperor God time to rest and recover.</p><p>The Emperor God closed his eyes and regulated his breathing. Half an hour later, he opened his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two rays of light fell on Lu Ming and the Emperor God.</p><p>The battle of the peak began!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming and di Shen moved almost at the same time. In a flash, they landed on the fighting ring, facing each other.</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, a three-thousand-foot-long Dragon of fate was suspended. Above the Emperor God’s head, the Dragon of fate had also reached more than two hundred and sixty feet, only a few hundred feet away from Lu Ming’s Dragon of fate.</p><p>The two fate Dragons were facing each other!</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were calm and indifferent. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, you’ve seen my abilities. Do you think there’s still a need to fight?”</p><p>His voice was calm, but it was filled with confidence.</p><p>“How do you know you’re going to win if you haven’t fought?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>alright, then today, I’ll completely destroy your confidence!</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes shone with a sharp light. originally, I wanted to kill you today, but His Majesty told me not to kill you. So, I’ll spare you today!</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Emperor God’s intention was simple. He had wanted to have a life-and-death battle with Lu Ming and kill him in one battle, but Martial Emperor Di Yi told him not to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that Martial Emperor Di Yi wanted to capture Lu Ming alive and take his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Emperor God, the first place on the list of top 1000 talents will have a new master!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. Today, no matter what, Lu Ming had to win.</p><p>If he could not even defeat di Shen or Di Yi, who was a junior, how could he fight against Di Yi?</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward di Shen.</p><p>With every step he took, the aura on Lu Ming’s body became more violent.</p><p>Four intents revolved around him as his true essence circulated. His dragon power burst forth, and his skin was covered in a layer of dragon power.</p><p>One, two, three.</p><p>Lu Ming released three bursts of dragon energy in one go.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s body was filled with sword will and a vast sword power burst out. He took a step forward and approached Lu Ming at a great speed. A combat sword appeared in his hand and he slashed.</p><p>Sword intent bloomed, and one after another, terrifying sword light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw more than a dozen punches in a row. With each punch, a sword gleam was shattered. After a dozen punches, more than a dozen sword gleams were shattered.</p><p>Emperor God, use your full strength. You can’t defeat me like this!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, the fighting spirit in his eyes growing stronger.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s indifferent voice came out, and his aura became stronger. His cultivation at the peak of the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm was undoubtedly revealed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a step forward and his figure seemed to be shuttling through space. In the next moment, he appeared dozens of meters away and headed toward Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>At the same time, he slashed his sword in the air.</p><p>At this moment, all the hair on Lu Ming’s body stood on end. A strong sense of danger rose in his heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the nick of time, Lu Ming stomped his feet and retreated rapidly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, a sword gleam slashed at the spot where he had been standing just now. It slashed the fighting ring, causing sparks to fly.</p><p>“Your spiritual sense is quite sharp, but I’ll see how many moves you can block!”</p><p>The Emperor God said coldly and wielded his sword.</p><p>In an instant, he slashed out dozens of times.</p><p>Lu Ming’s sense of danger grew stronger. Without any hesitation, he started to run wildly on the fighting ring.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming ran past, there would be sword gleams slashing out. Every sword almost cut Lu Ming.</p><p>“Only running? But in front of me, you don’t even have the right to run!”</p><p>The Emperor God snorted coldly and stomped.</p><p>His figure appeared on the fighting ring like a Phantom, as if he was traveling through the void. In a few breaths, he was close to Lu Ming.</p><p>The combat sword slashed out and countless sword gleams appeared around Lu Ming, blocking all his escape routes.</p><p>since I can’t Dodge, I’ll use my strength to blow it up!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed with ferocity. The last three dragon energies in his body exploded.</p><p>There were a total of six dragon energies, and Lu Ming used all of them.</p><p>His strength increased rapidly. Lu Ming threw dozens of punches in all directions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All the sword lights around him shattered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. He continued to throw punches. With every punch, a terrifying power exploded, completely distorting and compressing the space.</p><p>The Emperor God’s sword light was crushed before it could leave the space.</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes turned cold. He kept swinging his combat sword while Lu Ming’s fist kept punching the air.</p><p>Every time it struck, it shattered the Emperor God’s sword light.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, this move is not bad!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>although the Emperor God’s sword can travel through the void and change unpredictably, there will definitely be fluctuations in the space when the sword light is about to be slashed. As long as Lu Ming senses the fluctuations, he will bombard the space with powerful fist force and distort it. Then, the Emperor God’s sword light will not be able to be slashed!</p><p>Supreme Master ninesuns nodded in agreement.</p><p>Many big shots nodded to themselves as they understood what was going on, but they were also secretly shocked.</p><p>It wasn’t difficult to sense the spatial fluctuations, but the key was to block them. That was the difficult part.</p><p>Lu Ming’s every punch was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>They discovered that the power that Lu Ming was displaying now was stronger than when he was fighting ao tu.</p><p>When Lu Ming was fighting with ao tu just now, he had actually concealed his strength. This shocked them.</p><p>“Hmph! Your strength is not bad, so I’ll defeat you face to face!”</p><p>The Emperor God snorted coldly. He stopped drawing his sword. He took a step forward and his figure was like a flickering light and a fleeting shadow. He was unbelievably fast and approached Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Having comprehended the space concept, his speed was equally terrifying. Lu Ming realized that even if he used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, he would still be slower.</p><p>As he approached Lu Ming, a terrible sword power burst out of the Emperor God’s body. The mighty sword power pressed down on Lu Ming, and the terrible sword light slashed at Lu Ming. The void was distorted and even cracked.</p><p>The power of this sword was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The combination of the space and sword mentality made the power of the sword reach its peak.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming wanted to retreat, he had no way out.</p><p>If he retreated, he would face an even more violent attack from the Emperor God.</p><p>The only way was to face them head-on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
