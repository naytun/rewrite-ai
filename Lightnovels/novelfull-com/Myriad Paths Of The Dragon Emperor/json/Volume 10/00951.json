However, that was all. Many who had awakened a first or even second level divine level bloodline would fail to break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Of course, the higher the level of the awakened divine bloodline, the higher the success rate would be.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm could have a lifespan of five thousand years. In the eastern barren land, there were hundreds of large regions. How many spiritual God Realm experts had accumulated in the past five thousand years?</p><p>Very few!</p><p>And how many among the younger generation had awakened divine bloodlines? There were 300 on the list of top 1000 talents alone, and there were also new talents. If those with divine bloodlines could break through to the spiritual God Realm, there would be hundreds of them in this generation. How was that possible?</p><p>Even if this generation was at its golden age, it would be good enough if one or two hundred people could break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Many God-tier geniuses might not even be able to defeat the spirit God.</p><p>That was why those who could break through to the spiritual God Realm were all geniuses among geniuses. They were all extremely powerful, and with such an existence in the Royal Three-eyed God race, it wouldn’t be easy for the two forces to seize the last totem pillar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to fight for the last totem pole?”</p><p>Huan Zhen asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.”Why not? If both sides fight, I might be able to benefit from it!”</p><p>with your combat strength, you might have a chance. Unfortunately, I was injured in the previous battle and can’t help you!</p><p>Huan Zhen said.</p><p>no need to help. I’m just going to take a look. It’s better to hide alone. If there’s an opportunity, I’ll wait for it. If there’s no opportunity, then forget it!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Huan Zhen pondered for a moment. His hand glowed and an inscription talisman scroll appeared. He handed it to Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, this is a peculiar inscription talisman that I obtained previously. As long as you activate it with your own mental energy fire, you can condense eight people that look exactly like you. Moreover, they all have the same aura. It might be helpful for your trip!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He did not decline and kept it, saying,”Many thanks, I will definitely repay this favor in the future!”</p><p>This inscription scroll was very precious. It could actually condense eight people with the same aura as the user. It could definitely save a life at a critical moment. This was clearly a treasure that Huan Zhen had obtained from the battle of Providence. Lu Ming was very grateful that Huan Zhen was willing to give such a treasure to him.</p><p>you’re welcome. You saved me before!</p><p>Huan Zhen laughed. He was a handsome man that could make women jealous.</p><p>“Then I’ll go to the capital. If there’s anything, you can contact me at any time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he looked at Bai chixue, who was not far away, and turned to leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai chixue called him from behind.</p><p>“Miss Bai, don’t worry, I’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much. He headed for the capital.</p><p>“Why did he call me miss Bai? Didn’t you just call me Chi Xue?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at Lu Ming’s back as he left, lost in thought.</p><p>there are rumors that during the war in ninedragons, Lu Ming did it for a woman. Could that woman be Lu Ming’s lover? ”</p><p>Thinking of this, Bai chixue let out a long sigh, and her eyes looked a bit sad.</p><p>……</p><p>A beam of light streaked across the sky, traveling a hundred miles in an instant.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the territory where the three-eyed God race’s Imperial City was.</p><p>He carved an array for himself to conceal his aura, and then continued to move forward.</p><p>Soon, a magnificent city appeared in front of them.</p><p>This was the royal city of the three-eyed God race.</p><p>There were three-eyed God soldiers patrolling on the tall and majestic city walls, day and night.</p><p>Last time, the prodigies from both sides charged into the capital, and this caused the three-eyed God race to be even more cautious.</p><p>I’ll wait here. I guess the two sides will start fighting in a few days!</p><p>Lu Ming hid in a secret place and observed the capital from afar.</p><p>One day, two days …</p><p>Time passed day by day, but neither side made a move.</p><p>Obviously, both sides had the same idea, waiting for the other side to make the first move, and then reap the benefits.</p><p>On the last day, both sides finally could not hold back and attacked at almost the same time.</p><p>From the South and North of the capital, there were more than 100 rainbow lights each, rushing towards the capital at an extreme speed.</p><p>Both sides had sent out more than a hundred people. Each one of them was a heaven’s favorite among heaven’s favorites, and they were extremely powerful.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! a furious roar immediately erupted from the three-eyed God race’s capital city, and the entire city exploded with powerful energy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The battle cries shook the heavens. More than a hundred people from both the north and south charged into the capital like a sharp knife.</p><p>Every one of them was a heaven’s favorite who could jump several levels and kill their opponents. They were extremely powerful, especially a top heaven’s favorite like Luo Tian. He was so powerful that he could easily kill a ninth level spirit embryo realm cultivator.</p><p>A brilliant light flashed, and although the three-eyed God race had a lot of people, they were instantly killed. The two sides quickly rushed towards the center of the capital.</p><p>“Those few people in the lead are so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming watched from afar and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>On the north side was the Allied army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley. The few people in the lead were extremely powerful. Their attacks erupted and killed anyone who stood in their way.</p><p>A golden-robed youth wearing a golden crown slashed out with his sword. Regardless of whether they were at the ninth level or the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, they were all killed in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming even discovered that a powerful existence with a perfected spirit embryo was killed by him with one slash.</p><p>Strong, extremely powerful.</p><p>this man’s aura is similar to di Feng’S. He must be di Shen, the top talent among the young generation of the eastern barren territory and the top one on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Emperor God was also the descendant of Martial Emperor Di Yi, but he was terrifyingly talented. Some people said that his talent was not weaker than Martial Emperor Di Yi’s when he was young, and he had the potential to become an Emperor in the future.</p><p>Beside the Emperor, the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley also had their own powerful heaven’s favorites.</p><p>In the South, in the bloody blade continent, there were also proud sons of heaven on the same level as the Emperor-god level.</p><p>In just a few minutes, they had broken through many obstacles and were about to reach the center of the capital.</p><p>“You still dare to charge in, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the center of yunwu city. Then, a beam of light with lightning struck toward the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God struck out with his sword and destroyed the light beam, but he was also stopped.</p><p>Then, several beams of light burst out in succession, shooting toward the north and south. The bloody blade continent and the eastern barren territory were both attacked.</p><p>so there are still old guys like you. You guys block the other three-eyed gods, and we’ll take the totem pillar!</p><p>The Emperor God’s voice was heard.</p><p>Then, he, together with the most powerful paragons of the heavenly Demon tribe and the heavenly corpse sect, charged forward as if they had met their match. Sword Qi and Saber Light shot up into the sky in the capital.</p><p>&Nbsp; the bloodblade continent was doing the same. The strongest few charged forward while the others blocked the other three-eyed gods.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
