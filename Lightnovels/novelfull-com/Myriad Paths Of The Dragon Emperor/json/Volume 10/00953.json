The moment he did so, a beam of light descended from the sky and landed on Lu Ming. The attacks from all directions were blocked by the light beam.</p><p>At this moment, the three-eyed God race, the divine Emperor, and the others did not attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The paragons of the bloodblade continent let out indignant roars and attacked Lu Ming frantically. Unfortunately, no matter how they attacked, they were blocked by the light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, pillars of light descended from the sky and enveloped the youths of the bloodblade continent. Then, as they roared unwillingly, the geniuses of the bloodblade continent all disappeared on the spot with a flash.</p><p>It was obvious that they had failed and were teleported out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the totem pole in Lu Ming’s hands trembled violently. It flickered with light and then flew into the sky.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming realized that another totem pole in his storage ring had flown out of the storage ring by itself and into the sky.</p><p>Totem pillars also flew out of the Emperor God’s and the others ‘storage rings.</p><p>The most shocking one was the Emperor God. Two of them flew out of his storage ring at the same time.</p><p>A few million miles away from the capital, a fatty was carrying a huge axe. Beside him was a beautiful woman. The two of them were casually walking in the sky.</p><p>They were fatty Kong Jin and ruan Tingting.</p><p>Suddenly, the Fatty’s face changed. A totem pillar flew out of his storage ring. The totem pillar glowed and pierced through the space, flying into the distance.</p><p>The next moment, fatty reacted and let out a shrill cry, ” “Ah, my totem pole!”</p><p>The totem pillar that he had obtained with great difficulty had actually flown away by itself. He immediately flew in the direction of the totem pillar.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky above the Imperial City trembled as the totem pillars started to gather. Soon, all ten of them had gathered together and formed a strange array in the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the battle in the capital stopped. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The totem pillars gathered together, and a bright light shot up into the sky.</p><p>The space was torn apart by the light, and a huge hole appeared. From the inside, a huge ancient city could be seen.</p><p>……</p><p>In the eastern wilderness, the higher-ups of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, the sky demon Valley, and the talisman Amulet sect had all gathered at their respective ancient teleportation portals, which were the entrances to the battle of Providence.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other senior members, as well as some powerful elders, were all gathered in the area near the ancient stone.</p><p>the one-year deadline is about to arrive. I wonder if the ancient city of Providence will be able to open this time!</p><p>Du songjue sighed.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to open the ancient city of Providence, and most of the battles for Providence in the past hadn’t even been able to open it.</p><p>The number of times it could be opened was in the minority.</p><p>“I hope it can be opened. However, once it’s opened, my Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples will be in danger!”</p><p>Bai Shijin sighed.</p><p>The other elders also sighed.</p><p>They were conflicted. After the opening of the ancient city of Providence, it would be the final battle. This was an opportunity for the talisman sect disciples, but it was also very dangerous. Without strength, they would only be killed by others.</p><p>At the same time, they thought of Lu Ming.</p><p>They wanted Lu Ming to be the top of the list of top 1000 talents, but they knew that it was too difficult.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming had too little time. Before the battle of Providence, Lu Ming’s combat strength could only compete with those at the bottom of the hundred.</p><p>However, the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents were all more powerful than the last. It would be too difficult for Lu Ming to catch up with them in a year.</p><p>After all, he would improve, and so would the other geniuses.</p><p>They didn’t have much hope in their hearts.</p><p>Time slowly passed. Suddenly, the stone began to shake and emit a bright light.</p><p>it’s activated! The teleportation formation has been activated, which means that the ancient city of Providence has been activated!</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll enter the ancient city of Providence!</p><p>Du songjue shouted.</p><p>Everyone stepped forward and entered the teleportation array.</p><p>At the same time, in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley, there was also an ancient stone that was glowing. The higher-ups of the three parties stepped into the teleportation array and disappeared.</p><p>In the eastern barren land, above a barren mountain, a shocking roar suddenly came from the endless void.</p><p>Wind and clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and Thunder rumbled. Suddenly, the endless void cracked, and a huge spatial crack appeared. Then, an ancient city emerged from it.</p><p>This ancient city was more than 10000 miles in length and width. In the middle of the city, there was a huge fighting stage. The fighting stage was made of a strange metal with strange patterns on it.</p><p>Around the fighting ring, there were rows of seats in the shape of a ring. It was like a Colosseum. Sitting on the seats, one could look down and see everything happening in the fighting ring.</p><p>There was no grandstand on the north side of the battle stage. Instead, there was a long flight of stairs that extended from the bottom to the battle stage.</p><p>Suddenly, four black vortexes appeared in the sky above the stands, from which many figures emerged.</p><p>In one of the vortexes, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other patriarchs of the symbol puppet sect appeared.</p><p>On the right side of the talisman Amulet sect, silhouettes filled with corpse Qi and ghostly Qi appeared. They were the higher-ups of the heavenly corpse sect, all of whom were extremely powerful.</p><p>In particular, there was a tall figure among them. He was shrouded in endless corpse Qi, and his appearance could not be seen clearly. His aura was not strong, but it gave people a huge pressure.</p><p>“The corpse Emperor of the sky corpse sect!”</p><p>Upon seeing this figure, Bai Shijin and the others ‘pupils contracted and they became extremely solemn.</p><p>The sky corpse sect’s corpse Emperor was a sovereign path expert, on par with Martial Emperor Di Yi. They were renowned throughout the eastern barren territory.</p><p>This time, even the corpse Emperor had appeared, which showed how important this battle of Providence was.</p><p>Fortunately, the ancient city of Kismet was similar to the entrance to the battle of Kismet. There was a powerful suppression, and the older one was, the stronger the suppression. Even Imperial Dao experts would be greatly suppressed here, and they wouldn’t be able to display much of their battle prowess.</p><p>That was why they weren’t too worried. If they were outside, the zombie Emperor could kill them all by himself.</p><p>On the right side of the heavenly corpse sect, another group of people also appeared.</p><p>They were from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. The clan heads of the six great ancient clans were all here. There were also a few other people who exuded a similarly imposing aura. Clearly, they were characters on the same level as the clan heads of the six great clans.</p><p>The Supremes of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were not limited to the clan heads of the six great ancient clans.</p><p>However, the gazes of Bai Shijin and the others directly skipped over them and landed on a middle-aged man in a purple and gold robe.</p><p>“Martial Emperor Di Yi!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others were shocked.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi had come in person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
