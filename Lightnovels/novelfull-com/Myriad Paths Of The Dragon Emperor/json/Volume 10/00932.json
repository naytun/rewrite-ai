A figure was rapidly approaching.</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, the figure stopped not far away. It was Ji mai, the 107th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Zongzi!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had ended his cultivation, Ji mai flew over.</p><p>Ji mai had also joined Lu Ming’s team recently. At this time, Ji mai looked at Lu Ming with a complicated expression.</p><p>In fact, when Ji mai first entered the observatory, his mental energy fire had already broken through to the seventh level. During this period of time, he had made more progress and initially thought that he had finally surpassed Lu Ming.</p><p>However, during this period of time, he realized that the gap between him and Lu Ming was getting bigger and bigger. Lu Ming’s combat strength was simply unfathomable.</p><p>After learning from the other talisman sect disciples that Lu Ming could even kill the little demonic Lord and could even tame the demon race’s heavenly child Vajra, who was no weaker than the little demonic Lord, he immediately dispelled the thought of competing with Lu Ming and was full of admiration for him.</p><p>“Ji mai, did you find anything?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, stood up and asked.</p><p>“Zongzi, I’ve indeed discovered something!”</p><p>Ji Mai’s expression was serious.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“There’s a possibility that there are chosen from our Talisman Amulet sect more than 300000 kilometers away, but they’re trapped in one place!”</p><p>Ji mai said.</p><p>Immediately, Ji mai began to explain in detail.</p><p>It turned out that he had been observing the situation within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles. He had heard the sound of a battle outside a Valley.</p><p>He looked from afar and found that inscriptions were shining in the valley and flames were soaring into the sky. Someone was fighting.</p><p>However, the aura was extremely powerful, far stronger than Ji Mai’s. Ji mai knew very well that there must be a heaven’s favorite who was far stronger than him. If he attacked, he would only die. So, he hurried back to report to Lu Ming.</p><p>His aura far surpassed Ji Mai’s. He was definitely in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents, or even higher.</p><p>The person from the talisman sect who was trapped was definitely no small matter.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s guess was right, there should be a Paragon of the talisman Amulet sect in the valley who had set up an array to resist the attacks of others.</p><p>Ji mai, lead the way. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As for the talisman Amulet sect disciples, they didn’t have to worry about them. They had already set up a dense array in the vicinity.</p><p>The advantage of the talisman sect’s disciples was that as long as they had the time, they could inscribe a powerful array formation, and defense was not a problem at all.</p><p>Ji mai nodded and flew away with Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them flew at top speed without stopping. It did not take long for them to arrive at the place Ji mai mentioned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A purple flame shot up into the sky and covered half of the sky. At the same time, runes and arrays glowed, forming a light shield to block the attack of the flame.</p><p>“Purple Heavenly Fire, it’s the Wang family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He was all too familiar with the extreme Purple Heavenly Fire.</p><p>“Wen zhishi, do you think that hiding in there will be of any use? Sooner or later, I’ll break through your formation, and you won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out.</p><p>it’s senior brother Wen Qinyi!</p><p>Ji Mai’s expression changed.</p><p>Wen zongshi was one of the thirteen candidates from the talisman sect. He was also very famous among the thirteen candidates. He was ranked 52nd on the list of top 1000 talents, only one rank lower than brother Li Tian.</p><p>But now, Wen Zhongyi was clearly in trouble.</p><p>“Wang Chen, I didn’t offend you, and you’re already trying to kill me?”</p><p>A voice came from the valley.</p><p>“Didn’t you hear what my Wang clan’s Supreme martial artist said before we entered the battle of karmic luck? Kill anyone you see from the talisman Amulet sect. You Talisman Amulet sect are really bold. Lu Ming is wanted by His Majesty, Martial Emperor Di Yi, and you dare to take him in. You’re courting death. Who can you blame?”</p><p>The voice from before rang out.</p><p>haha, what a joke. I heard that the Supreme martial artist of the Wang family was almost beaten to death by Lu Ming. A dignified Supreme martial artist almost died at the hands of a young man. No wonder he flew into a rage out of humiliation and took his anger out on our Talisman Amulet sect!</p><p>In the valley, Wen zhongtu’s voice rang out.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Accompanied by an angry roar, the light of the top grade purple Heavenly Fire brightened. The light shield formed by the formation trembled continuously and was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“Wang Chen, ranked 43rd on the list of top 1000 talents?” There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Wang Chen, ranked 43rd on the list of top 1000 talents. No wonder Wen zhishi was trapped here.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the valley.</p><p>In a few breaths, they were close to the valley.</p><p>From afar, he could see more than a dozen figures standing in the sky above the valley.</p><p>There were both men and women, and at the very front, there was a purple-robed young man. His entire body was covered in monstrous flames, and he was constantly launching attacks at the bottom of the valley.</p><p>This person must be Wang Chen.</p><p>There were three young people in the valley, two men and one woman.</p><p>A scholarly-looking man stood in front of Wang Chen, waving his hands continuously. Purple mental energy flames danced and formed an array to resist Wang Chen.</p><p>Behind this person, there was another man and woman sitting cross-legged, their faces pale. They were obviously injured.</p><p>“Meng Jia!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the woman. She was Meng Jia, whom he had met during the competition. As for the young man, Lu Ming remembered him as well. He was Gong Fei, one of the 13 zongzi candidates of the talisman sect, ranked 77th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>The one who was fighting with Wang Chen was, without a doubt, Wen zhishi.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Ji mai approached, those people heard the commotion and turned around to look at them.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When these people saw Lu Ming, they cried out in surprise. At the same time, their eyes were filled with a shocking killing intent.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the others and landed his gaze on two of them.</p><p>A man and a woman.</p><p>The woman was Wang haoxian. She was still wearing a ring around her neck, and her face looked Haggard. The aura on her body was weak. After so long, he was still at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Logically speaking, with Wang haoxian’s talent, he should have been able to reach the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm at the very least, or even higher.</p><p>It was obvious that she was being controlled, and it was difficult for her to improve her cultivation.</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming, her eyes lit up.</p><p>As for the other young man, he was wearing a starry robe. He was actually from the Holy star.</p><p>After the battle on the sacred constellation and Mu Lan’s wedding day, the sacred constellation had disappeared. He never thought that he would see it here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>kill him! Saint constellation said in a cold voice. The killing intent in his eyes was extremely strong.</p><p>His grandfather, Shangguan Zhongyuan, had been smashed to death by Lu Ming’s Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron in the battle of ninedragons. He was a spiritual God Realm powerhouse, but he had died just like that.</p><p>With Shangguan Zhong Yuan’s death, the status of Shangguan Wu Chen, Shangguan Wu Ling, and even the sacred constellation had plummeted in the Shangguan clan. If it were not for the fact that he had awakened the divine bloodline, he would have been in an even worse state.</p><p>Therefore, when the new and old grudges were added up, one could imagine how much he hated Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Ji mai, what are you guys doing here? Hurry up and leave!”</p><p>In the valley, Wen Zhongli also saw Lu Ming and Ji mai and immediately shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ji mai were no match for Wang Chen and the others. Furthermore, there were even more terrifying heaven’s favorites here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
