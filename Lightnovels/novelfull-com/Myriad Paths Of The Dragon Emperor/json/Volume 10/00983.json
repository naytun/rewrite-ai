Wherever the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s Army passed by, the territory of the talisman Amulet sect surrendered.</p><p>In just a month, all the territories of the talisman Amulet sect were occupied by the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. The talisman Amulet sect was only left with the Yin Yang mountain.</p><p>On this day, the roars of beasts could be heard outside the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>Countless powerful beings appeared outside of Mount Liangyi, riding on all kinds of fierce beasts. Their iron hooves stomped in the air, shaking the entire space.</p><p>The flags fluttered and covered the sky. The aura of countless powerhouses was so strong that the sky changed color.</p><p>The great army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The entire Mount Liangyi glowed, and countless inscriptions filled the air. The power of heaven and earth rose, and a huge Taiji diagram appeared in the sky above Mount Liangyi.</p><p>The yin-yang fish appeared and covered the entire Mount Liangyi.</p><p>Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and many other elders stood at the edge of Mount Liangyi, watching from afar through the formation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook as if a giant was stepping through the air. One after another, terrifying auras shot up into the sky.</p><p>Ten figures appeared in front of the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Their vast auras burst out. Each of them was like an invincible God of War.</p><p>The heads of the six great ancient families were all here, and the other four were undoubtedly at the same level.</p><p>The ten great masters!</p><p>“Bai Shijin, du songjue, if you know what’s good for you, quickly surrender and hand over Lu Ming. Perhaps you can still ensure the safety of your Talisman Amulet sect. Otherwise, once the formation is broken, everyone in the talisman Amulet sect will be killed!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan was the first to speak. His voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>if you have the ability, then break the formation. If you can break the formation, we will die without regrets!</p><p>Bai Shijin coldly replied.</p><p>it’s said that the formation of Mount Liangyi can’t be broken. I want to see if the rumor is true!</p><p>The Wang clan leader’s body was engulfed in flames. The scorching flames burned the space into nothingness, revealing a dark void that was deep and terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>It was a flaming sword that was thousands of meters long, and it exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>Even though they were separated by the array, many of the talisman sect’s disciples revealed looks of fear. In front of a Supreme martial artist, they felt like ants that were difficult to contend against.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family roared and slashed his flame sword at the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>This sword could tear space apart and penetrate the earth. It had the power to destroy heaven and earth.</p><p>The space was shattered by the sword.</p><p>It was the first time for many of the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples to see a Supreme martial artist’s power. They were shocked and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flaming sword slashed at the Taiji diagram above Mount Liangyi.</p><p>The heavens and earth trembled, but the Tai Chi diagram did not shake at all. It was as stable as Mount Tai.</p><p>The sword light disappeared, and the Jiang family’s master looked gloomy.</p><p>the yin and yang formation can’t be broken by an Emperor. Wang Shengtian, Who Do You Think You Are? ”</p><p>Du songjue coldly berated, causing the killing intent in the Wang family head’s eyes to surge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above his head, the extreme Purple Heavenly Fire bloodline appeared. He performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a flaming sword. He slashed at the yin and yang battle again.</p><p>But this time, just like the last time, the yin and yang formation did not move at all, which made the head of the Wang family look even uglier.</p><p>When the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples saw this, they finally let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>In the past, it was rumored that the yin and yang formation could not be broken by emperors. However, it was just a rumor and he was not confident about it.</p><p>They were more worried when they saw the terrifying aura of the Supreme martial artist. But now, they didn’t have to worry anymore. The facts had proven that the yin and yang formation was strong and immortal!</p><p>“Let’s attack together. I don’t believe we can’t break this formation!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan said to the other nine.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The other nine people nodded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The ten great Supremes burst forth at the same time with an earth-shattering aura. The space around them couldn’t withstand the terrifying pressure and crumbled.</p><p>Behind them, the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace retreated hurriedly, retreating a full 10000 miles.</p><p>In the next moment, the ten Supreme Masters attacked at the same time. Ten terrifying attacks attacked the yin and yang formation at the same time.</p><p>“Maintain the formation!”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice was transmitted far away.</p><p>Many elders and disciples were pouring their spiritual energy into the array platforms.</p><p>There were countless platforms all over the yin and yang mountain that were connected to the yin and yang battle. The disciples of the talisman sect could continuously inject their spiritual power to maintain the power of the yin and yang Mountain Formation.</p><p>There were simply too many of such platforms scattered all over the place. They weren’t afraid that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace’s spies in the talisman Amulet sect would destroy all of them. After all, destroying a few platforms wouldn’t affect the Grand formation at all unless they destroyed all of them.</p><p>But that was impossible. How big was the yin and yang mountain? Even if there were spies, Bai Shijin and the others could kill them in time.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks of the ten Supremes only caused slight ripples on the Taiji diagram, which was negligible.</p><p>The yin and yang formation was not just for show.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>From the depths of the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, a voice rang out. The next moment, a golden sword light slashed through the space, vast and mighty, like the might of the heavens, slashing down towards the Taiji diagram.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The entire Mount Liangyi seemed to jump and shake.</p><p>However, the Tai Chi diagram glowed and blocked this sword light.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>But immediately after, one sword light after another slashed down violently. Accompanied by the sword light that was like the might of the heavens, a person stepped through the air.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>His figure was not very burly, but he gave people a feeling that he was as tall as the sky. He stood casually in the void like a god that could support the sky and earth.</p><p>His body was filled with golden light. Each ray of golden light turned into a combat sword and slashed at the yin and yang formation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Waves appeared on the Tai Chi diagram, and it kept shaking.</p><p>“Maintain it!”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s voice spread far and wide. In front of all the platforms, the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples continued to pour in their mental energy fire to maintain the power of the formation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Tens of thousands of golden lights gathered on Martial Emperor Di Yi’s body and turned into a huge sword, which slashed down.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky rumbled and the void shattered, revealing a terrifying spatial crack that was thousands of miles long.</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others looked extremely serious. The strength of Martial Emperor Di Yi was beyond their imagination. The yin and yang formation seemed to be under great pressure.</p><p>Fortunately, in the end, the yin and yang formation still withstood the attack and was not broken.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi restrained his aura, and his face was a little gloomy.</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others let out a long breath.</p><p>Although the ancestors of the talisman sect had said that martial emperors could not break the yin and yang formation, Martial Emperor Di Yi’s reputation was too great. He was invincible in the eastern barren territory. Before this, no one had any confidence.</p><p>If the yin and yang formation was broken, the talisman sect would be completely annihilated and there would be no one left in the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, there was a deafening sound from a mountain peak deep in the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>Then, a sun emerged from the mountain peak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
