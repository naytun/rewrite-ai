No matter how strong Huan Zhen was, he could only barely protect himself.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>A skinny monkey-like young man from the bloodblade continent was extremely agile. He was like an agile flying knife that constantly flickered. Blade light crisscrossed and shattered a few puppets. A few bolts of lightning were sent flying, and he killed a Talisman Amulet sect disciple with a single strike.</p><p>Then, he took a deep breath and absorbed the blood Qi of the talisman sect disciple he had killed through his nose.</p><p>hahaha, it’s so delicious! This blood Qi!</p><p>The skinny monkey-like young man’s face was filled with enjoyment, but his gaze became even more sinister.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a spear radiance pierced through the void from the South. It was extremely fast as it stabbed towards Shou hou.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>The skinny monkey was shocked. He wanted to Dodge immediately, but he realized that he was completely locked on by the spear radiance. The terrifying killing intent enveloped his body and he had no way to take it away. He could only use all his strength to resist.</p><p>A terrifying blade light shot out from Shou hou’s hand. However, when it clashed with the spear light, the blade light was shattered. The spear light burst out and pierced through Shou hou’s throat.</p><p>Skinny monkey’s eyes were wide open, full of unwillingness, and then he died.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the distance, more than a dozen spearlights flew over and stabbed at more than a dozen heaven’s favorites from the bloodblade continent.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>Several screams were heard as several experts from the bloodblade continent were killed.</p><p>“Who is it? You should die!”</p><p>The red-haired young man roared in anger and controlled the huge blade wheel to block the remaining spear radiance.</p><p>The other paragons of the bloodblade continent were shocked. They didn’t continue to surround the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples. Instead, they moved closer to the blood-haired youth and looked in the direction of the spear light.</p><p>Huanzhen and the others looked in that direction.</p><p>Who would come to save their Talisman Amulet sect?</p><p>A blue-robed young man stepped through the air and appeared before everyone.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai chixue was the first to shout.</p><p>The person who had attacked just now was Lu Ming, who had come all the way from the South.</p><p>On his way to the North, he didn’t expect to encounter the experts of the bloodblade continent besieging the talisman puppet sect’s disciples.</p><p>Needless to say, the two youths from the bloodblade continent were most likely here to help.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s not dead!”</p><p>Wen zhishi, Gong Fei, and the rest were overjoyed.</p><p>Previously, on the sky Poison Island, Lu Ming had gone all the way and never came back. Later, the poison gas sealed the island and everyone who had not died had left the sky Poison Island, but Lu Ming did not come out.</p><p>Wen zhishi and Gong Fei thought that Lu Ming had met with an accident in the depths of the sky Poison Island and had died.</p><p>After they brought the news back, the disciples of the talisman sect sighed and Bai chixue even cried a few times.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming was not dead and had even appeared at this time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave quickly. Leave this place quickly!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s face suddenly changed and she shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave quickly!”</p><p>Wen zhishi also shouted.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, he had easily killed a few fourth level spirit embryo realm geniuses. This was enough to prove that Lu Ming’s strength had improved again.</p><p>However, they were definitely no match for the red-haired young man. They were strong enough to fight with the top 10 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Even Huan Zhen was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming was here. Wasn’t he courting death?</p><p>it’s too late to leave now. You have to pay with your life for killing my people!</p><p>The red-haired young man’s voice was extremely cold. The huge wheel of blades was floating above his head, emitting a terrifying aura. It was a powerful secret treasure.</p><p>“You’ve killed my Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples. All of you must die!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not retreat. He continued to walk forward step by step. His voice was even colder than the blood-haired young man’s.</p><p>what big words! I’ll kill him!</p><p>A burly young man stepped out. He was more than two meters tall, two heads taller than Lu Ming. The muscles on his body bulged, and he was filled with explosive power. He held a huge sword the size of a door and stared at Lu Ming like a wild beast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He held the sword with both hands and rushed toward Lu Ming, slashing down.</p><p>The sixth level of spirit embryo realm was this youth’s cultivation.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming burst out with dragon energy. Scales covered his entire body as he threw a punch.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist hit the saber, causing it to shake. Then, under everyone’s horrified eyes, it collapsed, and metal fragments flew everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not stop, nor did his fist. He continued to blast out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist landed on the burly young man’s body. The burly young man screamed as a big hole was pierced through his chest. He was killed immediately.</p><p>The devouring power in his hand burst out, and the burly young man turned into a dry corpse in front of everyone’s horrified eyes.</p><p>he’s so strong! Lu Ming zongzi is so strong!</p><p>One of the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples said excitedly.</p><p>A peerless genius of the sixth level spirit embryo realm had been killed by Lu Ming with a single punch. What kind of combat strength did Lu Ming have?</p><p>Bai chixue and the others opened their eyes wide.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength is much stronger than it was five months ago!</p><p>Wen lezhang said.</p><p>“Can he be a match for those people?”</p><p>Bai chixue looked at the red-haired young man, still worried.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Wen zhishi shook his head.</p><p>At this moment, the young men from the bloodblade continent also widened their eyes in shock. The red-haired young man’s eyes also became serious.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His fighting spirit was like a rainbow, and his killing intent was like a tide. His figure was like lightning as he charged directly at the youth from the bloodblade continent.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and kill him!”</p><p>The red-haired young man shouted and controlled the huge wheel of blades to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the mountain and river diagram appeared. It expanded rapidly and surrounded the huge wheel of blades. The huge wheel of blades kept spinning and bombarding, but it could not break through the defense of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>damn it! I’ll Still Kill you even without the knife wheel!</p><p>die! the red-haired young man shouted coldly and slashed with his saber.</p><p>There was another youth who was just as terrifying. His cultivation was at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, and his combat strength was extremely shocking. He was definitely not weaker than the demonic Lord Luo Tian.</p><p>Both of them were comparable to the top ten on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged, and it opened its mouth to roar. Its devouring power erupted, enveloping all the youths of the bloodblade continent.</p><p>Those with lower cultivation bases trembled, and their eyes filled with shock. Their true Yuan and Qi were unstable, and they were about to be forcibly devoured.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming instantly struck Five Palms and kicked six times, killing five youths from the bloodblade continent. He also used his shoulder to kill another person.</p><p>On the sky Poison Island, Lu Ming had fought with more than a dozen spiritual gods in his sea of consciousness for a long time. Besides the increase in his cultivation, his use of martial arts techniques had also been greatly improved.</p><p>Now, every muscle and bone in his body could use the prison suppressing heavenly art. Even his hair could use the prison suppressing heavenly art. With a wave of his hand, it contained the Supreme power to suppress the nine nether prison.</p><p>At the same level, his combat strength was much stronger. It had increased by 30%.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
