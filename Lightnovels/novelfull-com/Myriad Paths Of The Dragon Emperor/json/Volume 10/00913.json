Lu Ming turned around and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to leave the place.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ro Li’s furious roar came from the violent energy, and after a few breaths, he charged out.</p><p>At this moment, he was in an extremely sorry state. His clothes were in tatters, and there were many wounds on his body that were bleeding profusely. His face was pitch black as if it had been burnt.</p><p>He swept his gaze around but there was no trace of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>A furious roar came from ro Li’s mouth.</p><p>Luo Li’s killing intent towards Lu Ming was extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and advanced at top speed.</p><p>The self-destruction of the nine fourth grade seventh level puppets was powerful, but Lu Ming knew that it would not do much to Luo Li.</p><p>“It’s still not enough to rely on the Dao of inscription!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>His Dao of inscription was already very strong, and he could instantly cast a level Seven primary array. If coordinated well, even an ordinary fourth level spirit embryo realm ancient martial art practitioner would be killed by him.</p><p>He had only just broken through to become a level-seven Alchemist, and that was already terrifying enough.</p><p>However, ro li was no ordinary warrior. He was a prodigy among prodigies.</p><p>my martial cultivation has to break through to the spirit embryo realm as soon as possible. Only then will I have the confidence to fight against prodigies like Luo Li!</p><p>The breakthrough to the spirit embryo realm was imperative.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, it was a piece of cake for him to deal with ordinary heaven’s favorites or even most of the God-level heaven’s favorites.</p><p>However, the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents, and even those who were ranked higher, were all monstrous geniuses. They were too strong for him.</p><p>After flying for a hundred thousand miles, Lu Ming landed and circulated his cultivation for a while. The injury on his arm was completely healed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a look at his luck value. It had exceeded ten thousand and reached ten thousand eight hundred.</p><p>He had obtained the secret manuals from the double Moon Mountain, and his luck value had increased by more than 5000.</p><p>I’ve finished exploring the strange land within a radius of 100000 li. I need to go further to explore!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and chose the West. He flew toward the West.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>After flying for a while, Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly stopped.</p><p>A group of figures appeared in front of him.</p><p>The three-eyed God race had a total of 100 or so people, and they were flying through the sky at high speed.</p><p>At this moment, the three-eyed God also saw Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s those human youths! Kill them! Kill them!</p><p>The moment the three-eyed gods caught sight of Lu Ming, they roared and charged at him.</p><p>the strongest seems to be at the fourth level of spirit embryo realm. Then, all of you will become my nourishment? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with cold killing intent.</p><p>He took a few steps forward, and the inscriptions continued to seep into the void.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The three-eyed God was extremely fast. In just a few breaths, he was already close to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a heavy step in the void. Runes glowed and an array appeared. It condensed into sword beams and slashed forward.</p><p>This was a level Seven array formation, and it was extremely powerful. Those three-eyed gods below the spirit embryo realm were instantly sliced in half, killed on the spot.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. With a roar, devouring power erupted. The blood essence, intent runes, and energy of the three-eyed Elder God that had been killed were all devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>Even those who survived were greatly weakened by the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to inscribe arrays and launched a storm of attacks. Some of the first and second level spirit embryo realm three-eyed gods found it difficult to resist and were killed under the storm of attacks.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The leader was a fourth level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God. He had a burly body and a powerful aura, but he was currently filled with fear as he shouted in shock.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Sword-light flashed, and one by one, the three-eyed God race was killed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, only the fourth level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God managed to charge out of the array’s range. He frantically fled into the distance, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>The other three-eyed gods were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>If he had directed all of his attacks at the fourth level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God, it would have been enough to kill him. However, the attacks were too scattered, so he had escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all the storage rings and controlled his nine Dragon bloodline to devour the hundred three-eyed gods and turn them into mummies before leaving the place.</p><p>Ten thousand miles away, Lu Ming dug out a cave in a large mountain. He carved an array at the entrance of the cave and sat cross-legged in the cave, beginning the refinement.</p><p>Although most of the hundred three-eyed gods were at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm and had perfected the spiritual ocean realm, their energy was still shocking. Lu Ming continued to refine them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s focus was on the concept.</p><p>He would get rid of the intent he didn’t need and refine the intent he needed.</p><p>Among them, the fire concept was the most abundant, and there was also the Thunder and wind concepts. There weren’t many earth concepts, but there were a few. There was even a three-eyed God at the second level of the spirit embryo realm who had comprehended the earth concept.</p><p>At the spirit embryo realm, one’s intent would definitely be at the third level.</p><p>This allowed Lu Ming’s earth concept to break through to the full circle of level two.</p><p>As his earth concept broke through to the perfected stage of level two, the massive amount of energy was constantly being converted into Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s aura skyrocketed and he broke through to the perfected spirit sea realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele emerged, exuding an ancient and heavy aura. The three golden chakras glowed, and the next moment, the fourth chakra emerged.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline had also advanced to the fourth level of the divine level.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had refined all the energy.</p><p>The Wind and Fire concepts had improved the most, and they were approaching the lower tier of level three.</p><p>His Thunder concept had also broken through to level three.</p><p>Only the earth concept was still at the great circle of level two.</p><p>His cultivation had also reached the peak of the perfected spirit ocean realm, and he was only one step away from the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>This time, he had gained a lot.</p><p>Moreover, his luck value had also increased by a few thousand.</p><p>“Killing these three-eyed God race beings really is worth it.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>the second level of the earth essence realm has been completed. Now is the time for the nature fruit to come in handy!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. The next moment, a nature fruit appeared in his hand. He swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>With a single thought, the nature manifestation fruit entered Lu Ming’s body and transformed into a wondrous energy. This energy seemed to follow Lu Ming’s thoughts and transformed into an extremely rich earth concept.</p><p>The nature fruit could transform into anything. It was truly mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated the earth concept with the nature manifestation fruit and made rapid progress.</p><p>Lu Ming took out another nature fruit after he had finished one.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had obtained a total of twelve nature fruits.</p><p>Three days later, after Lu Ming had consumed seven nature manifestation fruits, his earth concept finally broke through the bottleneck and reached level three.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming’s four concepts had all reached level three. Their power had increased to a terrifying level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
