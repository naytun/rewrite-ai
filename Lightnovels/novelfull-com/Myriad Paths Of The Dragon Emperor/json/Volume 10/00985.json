Everywhere was covered in blood. The sky was covered by the blood sea.</p><p>...</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue and the rest sent out a few messages to calm the people down. The talisman Amulet sect then slowly calmed down.</p><p>In the talisman Amulet sect’s conference hall, Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme, and the higher-ups of the talisman Amulet sect were sitting together to discuss some matters. However, the atmosphere was very solemn. Everyone felt as if a huge stone was weighing on their hearts.</p><p>“Senior white, senior du, how long can the yin and yang formation last?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Bai Shijin pondered for a moment and said, ” the great formation of Mount Liangyi mainly borrows the power of the mountains and rivers. At the same time, it is reinforced by the formation skills of the ancestors. It is indestructible. On the other hand, the main function of the boundless blood sea is corrosion. It slowly corrodes the foundation of the formation skills and then breaks the formation skills. This requires a process!</p><p>“As long as our Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples constantly inject their mental energy to maintain the formation and resist it, it should be possible to maintain it for five years!”</p><p>“Yes, it’s about the same time as I expected!”</p><p>Du songjue also nodded.</p><p>“Five years!”</p><p>Many people were slightly relieved, but the atmosphere was still heavy.</p><p>Five years might seem long, but it passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>What would happen to the talisman sect five years later if the formation was broken?</p><p>I have finally touched the threshold of the Emperor realm after reconstructing my body and with the blessing of fate. However, it is still very difficult to break through. I am not sure if I can break through within five years. Even if I do, I may not be able to compete with Di Yi. Di Yi is unfathomable!</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns spoke, and the atmosphere became even more serious.</p><p>“Then what should we do?”</p><p>An elder spoke.</p><p>Was he just going to sit and wait for death? Just wait for five years for Di Yi and Martial Emperor to come?</p><p>no matter what, we still have five years. Five years is enough for many changes to happen. We might have a chance!</p><p>After Bai Shijin spoke, everyone discussed the next step.</p><p>In the end, it was decided that all the resources of the talisman sect would be opened up to provide for the cultivation of the sect’s disciples. They would do their best to raise their strength to face the challenge in five years.</p><p>“Elders, I have something to discuss with the elders. You may leave first!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke, causing everyone to be stunned.</p><p>Many elder-level powerhouses looked at each other, then cupped their fists and said,”Yes, zongzi. We will take our leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming was now a zongzi and his authority was above that of ordinary elders. Naturally, these elders would not say much. Although they had doubts in their hearts, they still took their leave.</p><p>In the main hall, only nine suns Supreme, Yan kuangtu, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and a few of the most senior elders were left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you have to discuss with us?”</p><p>Bai Shijin asked.</p><p>What was it that required the elders to leave? They were curious.</p><p>“Seniors, I will be leaving Mount Liangyi for the next five years to cultivate in the outside world!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Leave Mount Liangyi?”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others were slightly stunned.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head solemnly.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s decision. He had the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Only by leaving the yin and yang mountain, adventuring, and fighting with the strong could his cultivation level improve quickly.</p><p>If he stayed in the yin and yang mountain, his cultivation would not improve much within five years, no matter how many resources he had. It would be good enough if he could break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>However, what was the use of a spiritual God Realm master when he faced Di Yi? Wouldn’t he still be slapped to death?</p><p>Only by taking risks outside could he have a slight chance to grow to the level where he could fight Di Yi.</p><p>I agree with Lu Ming’s idea. Lu Ming is still young and it’s the golden age for cultivation. If he’s trapped here, his achievements will be limited. He can only improve quickly if he goes out!</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns said.</p><p>“Not bad!” Yan Kuang tu nodded.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others also nodded.</p><p>but, if Lu Ming thinks of this, I’m afraid Di Yi will think of it too. If Lu Ming goes out, Di Yi will probably sense it through the nine Dragon bloodline. Wouldn’t that be more dangerous? ”</p><p>Bai Shijin muttered.</p><p>“Well, unless Lu Ming leaves the eastern barren territory and goes to other areas to cultivate!”</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>“I’m planning to head to the central continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As long as the distance was far enough, even Di Yi would not be able to sense the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>However, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were still frowning.</p><p>there’s one more important thing, ” Bai Shijin said after a while. ever since master Liao Cang disappeared, especially in the last few hundred years, the central continent’s Overlord forces have cut off all contact with the talisman Amulet sect. Therefore, if we want to go to the central continent, we can’t activate the inter-territory teleportation array and directly teleport to the central continent or other territories!</p><p>“What? We can’t teleport directly!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>The others also frowned.</p><p>The eastern barren territory and central continent were very far from each other. The border between the two territories was a vast chaotic territory. This chaotic territory ran from south to north, separating the central continent and the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Usually, Overlord forces like the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would have contact with the Overlord forces of the central continent. If one wanted to go to the central continent, they just had to take the inter-territory teleportation array and directly teleport to the Overlord forces of the central continent.</p><p>But now, the talisman Amulet sect no longer had any contact with the central continent’s Overlord forces. They had long cut off all contact and had no teleportation coordinates. There was no way to directly teleport over. If they couldn’t teleport, they could only cross the chaotic domain and head to the central continent.</p><p>However, the chaotic realm was extremely vast, extremely far away, and extremely dangerous. Even a spiritual God Realm master would face the risk of death if he wanted to cross the chaotic realm.</p><p>However, this was not the most important point. They were worried that Lu Ming could not be directly teleported to the central continent. If he walked out of the yin and yang mountain, he would definitely appear somewhere in the East continent. Di Yi might sense the nine Dragon bloodline and determine his location.</p><p>This was what they were worried about.</p><p>“This can be solved as well. As long as we work together and seal Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline aura for a while, it’s still possible. However, even in the central continent, I’m afraid that there are spies of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. If Lu Ming is found out by Martial Emperor Di Yi in the central continent, it will be even more dangerous.”</p><p>Du songjue said. He had thought through everything.</p><p>seniors, if I were still in the talisman Amulet sect, I would be able to attract the attention of Di Yi and Martial Emperor. Then, Di Yi would not pay attention to the affairs of the central continent, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re still in the talisman Amulet sect? Then how are you going to go to central continent?”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and even nine suns Supreme were a little confused. They did not know what Lu Ming meant.</p><p>“Seniors, look!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a Jade-like figure appeared in the hall.</p><p>“Heaven and earth Jade essence, you … You still have a heaven and earth Jade essence?”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others all widened their eyes and were tongue-tied.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had taken out a heaven and earth Jade essence. He did not expect to have another one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
