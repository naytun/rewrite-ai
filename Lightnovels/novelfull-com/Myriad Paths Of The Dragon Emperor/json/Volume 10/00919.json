This kind of improvement was too great.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared. Demonic Qi rolled around his body, and a blade light shot into the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A shocking saber radiance cut through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This blade was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to block this!”</p><p>The little demon Lord’s cold voice rang out along with the saber Light.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took a step forward. The aura on his body grew stronger, and a second dragon energy burst out in his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just like before, a loud boom rang out, and the energy roared.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>This time, the little demon Lord also took three steps back, while Lu Ming only took two steps back.</p><p>The little demon Lord was actually at a disadvantage. Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Now, they had already seen that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the second level of the spirit embryo realm, while the little demon Lord was at the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm. Lu Ming could actually cross two levels and suppress the little demon Lord. How was this possible?</p><p>It was simply inconceivable. Who was the little demon Lord? He was a genius among geniuses.</p><p>“Ah, die, die, I want you to die! Nine deaths demon saber!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared, his killing intent surging like a tide as he slashed out with his saber. Demonic might shook the sky, and the power was terrifying.</p><p>“You’re not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed toward the little demon Lord. Another burst of dragon energy erupted in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had increased. With every punch he threw, the space shook violently as if it would collapse at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming and the little demonic Lord were engaged in a fierce battle. The entire area was shaking violently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them fought from the ground to the sky, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, a figure fell to the ground at an extreme speed and stomped on the ground heavily, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>It was little demon Lord Luo Li. He was injured by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and looked down at the little demon Lord with a cold gaze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, brother Litian and the two powerful heaven’s favorites from the sky demon Valley surrounded Lu Ming in a flash.</p><p>“Luo Li, let’s attack together and take down Lu Ming!”</p><p>Brother Litian said.</p><p>“Not bad! There’s no need to talk nonsense with him!”</p><p>The sovereign of the sky demon Valley said.</p><p>Sanguine sword seven and sanguine sword nine also looked at Lu Ming with hostile gazes.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>Brother Litian said coldly.</p><p>“Do you think you can take me down by joining forces? How laughable. If I were to fight to the death, I’m confident that I can kill one of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold eyes swept across brother Li Tian and the rest.</p><p>They did not know why, but when Lu Ming’s gaze swept across them, their hearts turned cold.</p><p>They did not doubt Lu Ming’s words. When Lu Ming was fighting with the little demon Lord, although the little demon Lord did not use his full strength and did not use Blood Meridian fusion, Lu Ming did not use Blood Meridian fusion either.</p><p>Moreover, none of them knew if Lu Ming had any other trump cards that he had not used. If he had a stronger trump card, it was still possible for him to kill one of them in a desperate battle.</p><p>Who would be willing to die together with Lu Ming?</p><p>At the thought of this, their expressions turned ugly.</p><p>“I’ve already said that I’m here to cooperate. Let go of the talisman sect’s disciples and I’ll help you break the array. After breaking the array, we’ll leave the treasures inside to our own abilities. If we really have to fight, no one will be able to get the treasures in the ruins!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This time, the scene fell into silence.</p><p>Seventh sanguine sword and the others had grave expressions as they pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming had a faint smile on his lips.</p><p>This was strength. Only when one was strong could they talk about cooperation. Now, Lu Ming had already displayed his strong strength.</p><p>If one didn’t have the strength, it would be a joke to talk about cooperation with the other party. One would be suppressed by the other party.</p><p>“It’s impossible to let the talisman Amulet sect disciples leave. If we really let them leave, we might not be able to stop you if you play any tricks!”</p><p>Brother Litian said.</p><p>that’s right. I can’t let them leave, but I can ask them to break the formation with you!</p><p>The seventh Blood Sword said.</p><p>He would let the talisman Amulet sect disciples follow Lu Ming to break the formation while they guarded the surroundings. This way, Lu Ming would not be able to play any tricks.</p><p>alright, let’s do it this way. Release the talisman sect disciples and the talisman sect disciples who are breaking the array!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Brother Litian and the rest nodded. Then, they had the talisman Amulet sect disciples walk to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Zongzi!”</p><p>“Lu Ming zongzi!”</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect disciples walked to Lu Ming’s side and looked at him gratefully.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and looked ahead casually. He said coldly, ” “There’s still one more person, why not let him go?”</p><p>Bai chixue was still in their hands.</p><p>we can’t let this woman go. I can see that you have a special relationship with her. In order to prevent you from playing any tricks, she must be controlled by us!</p><p>The little demon Lord walked to Bai chixue and said with a cunning smile.</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>These people were all geniuses. Each of them had deep thoughts and was very meticulous. Of course, they could not trust Lu Ming completely.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go break the formation now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and strode into the legacy site.</p><p>The other talisman sect disciples followed closely behind him.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll follow him, don’t let him play any tricks!”</p><p>The little demon Lord said, his eyes flashing with killing intent. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>The paragons of the heavenly corpse sect in the sky demon Valley also nodded.</p><p>The three parties left a few people to keep watch outside. They moved one after another and followed Lu Ming. The little demon Lord even took action personally. He clasped Bai chixue’s shoulder with his fingers, not giving her a chance to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped after a few thousand meters.</p><p>In front of them was an area densely covered with formations. This area was about ten thousand meters deep, and after crossing this area, they would reach the core of the palace complex.</p><p>In other words, this 10000-meter area was densely covered with arrays.</p><p>Lu Ming took a light step on the ground and rows of inscriptions slithered forward like living snakes. The next moment, a complicated array appeared on the ground in front of him, shining with a colorful light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the arrays, searching for their weaknesses and thinking of ways to crack them.</p><p>A moment later, he extended a finger and waved it in the air. Inscriptions flew forward and entered the array.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Immediately, a few formations collapsed, turning into light and dissipating.</p><p>Brother Litian, the seventh sanguine sword, and the others ‘eyes lit up. In just a short while, Lu Ming had already cracked several arrays. There was hope for him to crack the array.</p><p>At the same time, their eyes were filled with solemness. Lu Mingming’s refinement path standard was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Luo Li, keep a close eye on this lady. Lu Ming is well-versed in the art of formations. This place is full of formations. We have to be careful to prevent him from playing any tricks!</p><p>Brother Litian sent a message to Luo Li.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
