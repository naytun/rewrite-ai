He circulated his essential core frantically and pushed the prison-suppressing heaven technique to 50% of its power. Then, he threw a punch.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist and the sword Qi collided, creating a terrifying boom.</p><p>The endless sword Qi scattered in all directions, as did the fist radiance. However, they were blocked by an invisible force at the edge of the fighting ring and disappeared.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took three consecutive steps back, his qi and blood surging.</p><p>that’s right. Then, take another strike of mine. Tiangang Emperor sword!</p><p>The Emperor God let out a long roar and slashed down again.</p><p>As he swung his sword, endless sword light burst forth, carrying with it the intention to cut through space, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the Tiangang Emperor sword, a low-grade divine bloodline martial technique. Di Shen had used this move to defeat Blood Sword one.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the fighting ring. They wanted to see how Lu Ming would resist this move!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard and nine Dragons appeared. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine claws of the nine Dragons continued to grab at it, pushing the prison suppressing heaven technique to 60%.</p><p>The sound of explosions continued to ring out.</p><p>Most of the sword light was blocked, but there were still a few that were not blocked. They landed on the nine Dragons, and their scales were instantly cut open. Deep wounds appeared on the nine Dragons ‘bodies, and blood flowed out.</p><p>But in the end, it was still blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>he can actually block the divine level martial technique of the Emperor God. Could it be that Lu Ming is also using a divine level martial technique? ”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Even blood Sword one was defeated by this move. It was unbelievable that Lu Ming could block it.</p><p>it’s definitely a God-tier martial technique. There’s no mistake!</p><p>A Supreme martial artist said.</p><p>Everyone was in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had also mastered a divine level martial arts technique. It was too shocking.</p><p>the situation is not good for Lu Ming. Although he has also mastered the divine level martial technique, with his cultivation, he can’t exert the full power of the divine level martial technique at all. However, the Emperor God’s cultivation is stronger, and the power of the divine level martial technique is stronger!</p><p>Yan kuangtu said worriedly.</p><p>The others didn’t say anything, but their expressions were grave.</p><p>On the battle stage, the Emperor God’s eyes shone with a shocking, sharp, and terrifying light. His voice was no longer indifferent, but also full of sharpness.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be able to take this move of mine. You’re not bad. Let’s see how you’re going to take it next.”</p><p>“Tiangang Emperor’s sword, one sword to conquer the world!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s entire body seemed to turn golden like a golden sun. He slashed out with the combat sword in his hand. The space in all directions was distorted and finally cracked. It was brought along by the Emperor God sword light and wrapped together as it slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was reasonable to say that only spiritual God Masters could cut open space. However, there was obviously a gap between an Emperor God and a spiritual God, but he could cut open space. This did not mean that his combat strength had reached the level of a spiritual God, but it was because of his space concept.</p><p>Driven by the concept of space, it cut through the space and charged toward Lu Ming with the power of space cutting.</p><p>Space twisted, and sword light was everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming fought back with all his might. His dragon claws kept striking out and his Dragon Tail lashed out like a divine whip.</p><p>However, there were too many sword lights in the surroundings, and their power was too strong.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s abilities, he could not block all of them. The extremely sharp sword Qi swam around Lu Ming’s body, cutting open wounds on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about his injuries. He fought back with all his might and fought the Emperor God.</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was constantly refining the energy of the origin stone to break through to the next realm.</p><p>He had already secretly ordered Nine Dragons to swallow more than two hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>He wanted to fight while breaking through to the next realm.</p><p>He felt that he was about to reach the eighth level spirit embryo realm soon.</p><p>The Emperor God was too powerful. If Lu Ming did not make a breakthrough in his realm, it would be difficult to defeat him.</p><p>The Emperor God’s two intents were level-four sword intent and level-three space intent. The fusion of the two intents was not any weaker than Lu Ming’s four intents.</p><p>Moreover, the Emperor God also mastered a divine level martial technique and cultivated a divine level cultivation technique. It was an extremely powerful divine level cultivation technique and his vital essence was extremely rich.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have any advantage in all these.</p><p>Lu Ming had the support of the Dragon power, but he felt that the Emperor God was also supported by a mysterious power, which was extremely powerful and unstoppable.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have the advantage in any of these aspects. In terms of cultivation, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming did his best and fought dozens of moves with the Emperor God.</p><p>At this moment, the scales on the nine Dragons ‘bodies had cracked and fallen off. They were covered with sword marks and blood was flowing out. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai chixue clenched her fists and her eyes were filled with a layer of mist. She was extremely worried.</p><p>Fatty, ruan Tingting, and the others did not say anything. They stared at the fighting ring and were extremely worried.</p><p>However, the people from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace, the heavenly demon Valley, and the heavenly corpse sect were gloating.</p><p>Lu Ming is going to lose. He’s no match for the Emperor God. What is he waiting for if he doesn’t admit defeat? ”</p><p>he’s just fighting to the death. I knew he couldn’t be a match for the Emperor God.</p><p>“I think Lu Ming will be defeated within ten moves!”</p><p>Voices came from all around.</p><p>it’s a pity that this is not a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming can admit defeat at any time. However, since he has offended His Majesty, Martial Emperor Di Yi, he will die sooner or later!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan thought to himself.</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor God’s aura grew stronger and stronger. Every slash of his sword was filled with shocking sword Qi. Space and sword intent combined to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>More and more wounds appeared on the nine Dragons ‘bodies.</p><p>“Refine, refine! Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and the essential core in his body was boiling.</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura burst out of the nine Dragons.</p><p>“What? Cultivation breakthrough? How is that possible?”</p><p>he’s actually breaking through at this time? impossible!</p><p>Voices of disbelief rang out one after another. On the grandstand, the big shots shouted in disbelief and stood up.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming had a breakthrough in his cultivation during the battle with the Emperor God? Unbelievable?</p><p>haha, this kid always exceeds my expectations. He has my style!</p><p>Fatty grinned and was extremely excited.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, Bai Shijin, and the others also revealed excited expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s move was beyond their expectations.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were no longer calm, and they were filled with anger and killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually broken through in the middle of a great battle with him. This was a blatant humiliation to him.</p><p>He was looking down on him and was using him to break through. At that moment, the Emperor God’s body burst out with a strong killing intent.</p><p>“The bloodline of the nine Dragons is indeed amazing!”</p><p>A faint voice was heard.</p><p>The person who spoke was Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled, and then they came to a realization.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming was too heaven-defying. It was because of his nine Dragon bloodline that he was able to break through during the great battle.</p><p>The Emperor God’s heart also calmed down, but the light in his eyes became colder.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, Bai Shijin, and the others secretly scolded Di Yi for being a cunning old fox. With one sentence, he pushed the shock caused by Lu Ming to the nine Dragon bloodline, calming di Shen’s shocked heart.</p><p>An Emperor God who had calmed down was the most terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
