The heaven and earth Jade essence was glowing and its body shape was slowly changing.</p><p>...</p><p>A month later, the heaven and earth Jade essence had completely transformed into a human body. It was a body of flesh and blood, and its appearance was exactly the same as Lu Ming.</p><p>The muscles on his body were firm and well-proportioned, full of perfect lines, like the most beautiful piece of art from heaven.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes, a smile on his face.</p><p>The second body had successfully cultivated it.</p><p>At this time, the second body also opened his eyes. However, there was no emotion in his eyes. His eyes were very empty and without any impurities, just like a newborn baby.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind flickered. His mind seemed to be able to enter the second body’s mind at any time. At this time, the second body showed a trace of emotion and nodded slightly at Lu Ming.</p><p>The main body and the second body could communicate with each other. No matter how far away they were, the main body could sense what the second body saw and what happened. The main body could even receive what the second body understood.</p><p>This was truly heaven-defying and unbelievable.</p><p>At this moment, a purple mental energy fire was dancing between the second body’s eyebrows. Countless runes suddenly appeared under his feet and spread in all directions, forming a large array.</p><p>it’s so fast! The inscribing speed is too fast! It’s more than twice as fast as my original inscribing speed!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The second body was free of impurities, and if he did one thing, he would focus on another, which was naturally more effective.</p><p>“In the future, you will focus on the Dao of inscription!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and touched the clone’s glabella. The cultivation experience that Lian Cang had sealed in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness was transferred to the clone’s sea of consciousness. Then, a scroll appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and flew into the clone’s glabella, disappearing.</p><p>It was the all formation diagram!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a storage ring and put it on.</p><p>The storage ring contained all kinds of materials related to the Dao of inscription. Lu Ming gave all of them to his clone.</p><p>The clone’s palm glowed and a set of blue clothes appeared. The clone put it on and instantly, he looked exactly like Lu Ming.</p><p>To be more precise, the clone was Lu Ming. It was no different from Lu Ming himself. The only difference was that the clone did not have Lu Ming’s consciousness.</p><p>With a single thought, the clone took a step forward, turned into a ray of light, and entered the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Lu Ming’s mind sank into his sea of consciousness and found the clone sitting cross-legged in his sea of consciousness, quietly cultivating the inscription Dao.</p><p>“It’s time to recover my soul force!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and reappeared. He then took out the soul consolidation stone and started to recover his soul force.</p><p>After all, splitting one’s soul in two was too much of a loss.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in seclusion for two months.</p><p>“It’s time to go!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes. After a month of refining the soul-consolidating stone, the soul force of his main body and his secondary body had almost fully recovered.</p><p>He then entered his sea of consciousness, got up, and walked out of the secret room.</p><p>Outside the secret chamber, Bai Shijin, du songjue, Yan kuangtu, and the nine suns Supreme were waiting.</p><p>“Lu Ming has come out!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s your cultivation going? Did you succeed?”</p><p>Bai Shijin asked. The rest of them looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a light flashed between his brows. He walked out and stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them were identical, both wearing blue robes.</p><p>The gazes of nine suns Supreme and the other three immediately fell on the second body. They sensed it carefully, and then their eyes revealed amazement.</p><p>“Wonderful, wonderful, this is simply a work of art that surpasses the heavens!”</p><p>Bai Shijin was extremely shocked and sighed.</p><p>it is indeed a stroke of good fortune. With such a body in the talisman Amulet sect, as long as he shows his face occasionally, Di Yi will definitely think that Lu Ming has always been here!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when do you plan to leave?”</p><p>Du songjue asked.</p><p>“We’ll set off in two days!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Well, before we set off, we’ll first seal the aura of your nine Dragon bloodline!” He said.</p><p>Du songjue nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to the few of them and went to the Lu family residence.</p><p>When Lu Yuntian and Li Ping saw two identical Lu Mings standing in front of them, they were stunned for a long time.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the eyes of the main body and the secondary body were different, they wouldn’t be able to recognize which was the main and which was the secondary.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, are you going to leave?”</p><p>Li Ping asked.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He only planned to tell Lu Yuntian and Li Ping about the main body and the secondary body. He did not tell anyone else.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, don’t worry. Your second body is also half of your soul, which means you’re with us!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>Indeed, the main body and the secondary body could communicate with each other. The secondary body was equivalent to Lu Ming.</p><p>father, here are some cultivation and martial arts techniques. Take them and cultivate them yourself. In the future, if there are any descendants of the Lu family, mystical sword sect, or Hua family who have good character and comprehension, you can pass them on to them!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a stack of secret manuals and passed them to Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Lu Yuntian took the book and casually flipped through it. His eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“This … A God-grade cultivation technique!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was incomparably shocked.</p><p>That’s right, the moment he opened it, he saw that it was a God-tier cultivation technique, the heaven warping divine technique!</p><p>yes, there are two deity-level cultivation techniques, and the rest are demigod-level martial arts techniques!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained all of these in the battle of Providence.</p><p>With these cultivation methods and martial arts techniques, he believed that the Lu family would definitely rise.</p><p>Lu Yuntian took a few deep breaths before he put away the secret manual solemnly.</p><p>……</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged in a secret chamber. The nine Dragon bloodline was suspended above his head. Bai Shijin and the others were beside him, constantly condensing inscriptions and covering the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>They only stopped after half a day.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline seeped into Lu Ming’s body, and he opened his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now that your nine Dragon bloodline has reached the sixth level of the divine level, your aura is too powerful. Even if we join forces, we can only seal it for half a year. After half a year, the seal will no longer be able to seal the aura of the nine Dragon bloodline.”</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>“Half a year is enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Half a year later, he would definitely be far away from the East continent. No matter how heaven-defying Martial Emperor Di Yi was, he would not be able to sense him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care. I hope to see you again in the future. You’re already able to shock the world!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu patted Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“Big brother Yan, senior Jiuyang, goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists solemnly and exchanged a glance with his second body. He then followed Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest and left in big strides.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to bring his second body with him, he would undoubtedly be much stronger. However, he had no other choice now. He had to leave his second body in the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Together with Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others, they arrived at a teleportation altar.</p><p>Lu Ming, all the territories of the talisman Amulet sect have been occupied by Martial Emperor Di Yi. The territories near the chaotic realm must have been occupied as well. The teleportation altars in those territories must be closely guarded.</p><p>however, my Talisman Amulet sect also has a secret teleportation altar hidden in the mountains and forests. You can teleport to that secret place. The rest will be up to you!</p><p>Bai Shijin warned.</p><p>“Thank you, senior white, senior du, and take care of yourselves!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and stepped into the teleportation altar. The teleportation altar glowed and formed a vortex. Lu Ming disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
