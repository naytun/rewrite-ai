There were tables, chairs, beds, and even a few bookshelves in the underground secret room.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and realized that there were only some books on the bookshelf.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and took a look at the books.</p><p>The sky leaping battle technique was a cultivation technique. Lu Ming opened it and his eyes widened. He was overjoyed.</p><p>It was a deity-level cultivation technique, a low-grade deity-level cultivation technique.</p><p>How precious was a God-grade cultivation technique?</p><p>For example, the core cultivation technique of the six great ancient aristocratic families of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was a low-grade deity-level cultivation technique.</p><p>A divine level cultivation technique could almost support an ancient family.</p><p>Lu Ming had the true war Dragon technique and did not need to cultivate other cultivation techniques.</p><p>It was unknown whether the true war Dragon technique that Lu Ming cultivated was low-grade or high-grade divine-level, but the cultivation requirements were extremely harsh. Others could not cultivate it at all.</p><p>Lu Ming had two disciples, family, and friends, but they could not cultivate the true war Dragon technique at all. However, he could pass on other divine level cultivation techniques to them.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he kept it.</p><p>Then, he looked at the other books.</p><p>There were more than a dozen books in total. Among them, there were two divine level cultivation techniques, and the others were martial arts techniques, demigod level martial arts techniques.</p><p>There were both low-grade and high-grade demigod martial techniques. This was an unimaginable wealth.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all of them in ecstasy and continued to walk around. He realized that the underground secret chamber was empty. There was nothing else. Lu Ming left the underground secret chamber reluctantly. He then chose a random direction and soared into the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming left, a figure with monstrous demonic Qi descended on the double Moon Mountain.</p><p>It was little demon Lord Luo Li!</p><p>“Eh? The formation here has been broken, someone has been here!”</p><p>I’m not afraid of you, ” ro li mumbled as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He stepped into the underground chamber and reappeared outside.</p><p>“As expected, someone has taken the first step. Damn it!”</p><p>Ro li growled and leaped into the air. The direction he chose was the direction that Lu Ming had left in.</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, the muscles and bones on his body squirmed. After a while, his body shape and appearance changed greatly.</p><p>Then, the inscriptions on his body glowed and he set up an array to conceal his aura. Not a single bit of aura leaked out from his body.</p><p>Now, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley both wanted to kill him. It would be more convenient for him to act by changing his identity temporarily.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was not a match for the top talents on the list of top 1000 talents for the time being. When he improved his cultivation, he would not need to be afraid of them anymore.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at a slow speed. He mainly wanted to see if there were any spiritual herbs and pick them.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A terrifying Sonic Boom suddenly came from behind him, and a vast demonic might permeated the air.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Immediately, a loud shout was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He stopped and turned to look.</p><p>Luo Li appeared not far from Lu Ming with his vast demonic power.</p><p>“Kid, which direction did you come from?”</p><p>Ro li pointed at the direction behind him.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Have you ever been to the double Moon Mountain?” Ro li asked.</p><p>Double Moon Mountain? what Double Moon Mountain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming played dumb.</p><p>Luo Li frowned slightly. He could tell that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm. There was no way he could break the array of Double Moon Mountain. The treasures of Double Moon Mountain should not belong to Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’ve never been to the double Moon Mountain? Did you see anyone pass by?” Ro li asked.</p><p>“No, I’ve been looking for spirit herbs in this area and didn’t see anyone else!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Okay, then you can go!”</p><p>Ro li waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and was about to leave when Luo Li’s eyes flashed with killing intent. With a wave of his hand, a Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming burst out with dragon power. He turned around and threw a punch, which collided with the saber Light. His body trembled and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Hmph, restrain your aura and be sneaky. Kill them first!”</p><p>Ro li snorted coldly, but a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Although he had casually struck out with that move, almost no one under the spirit embryo realm could block it. He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to block it. Lu Ming’s combat strength surprised him.</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. These people were really overbearing. They were just suspicious and wanted to kill him. Fortunately, he was prepared. He sensed it the moment Luo Li made his move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ro Li’s demonic Qi rolled and he swung his palm again. A black blade light was sent flying at Lu Ming.</p><p>A purple flame flashed between his brows. Lu Ming waved his hands and an array appeared in the air. It formed golden vines that wrapped around Luo Li.</p><p>carving an array in the air? you’re a level-seven Alchemist. It seems that you’ve obtained the treasure of Double Moon Mountain. Die!</p><p>Ro Li’s killing intent surged as he roared and his blade flashed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sturdy golden vine exploded in an instant, unable to withstand ro Li’s attack.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and waved his hands. One after another, large arrays appeared. They were all beginner level-seven arrays.</p><p>However, ro li was too strong. With a slash of his saber, everything was destroyed, and all the formations were shattered.</p><p>peak of the third level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Little demon Lord Luo Li’s cultivation was at the peak of the third level of the spirit embryo realm, but with his combat power, even if he was three levels higher, it would not be difficult for him to kill an ordinary sixth level spirit embryo realm ancient martial art practitioner. He was simply too strong.</p><p>And this was still in the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>If he was in the spiritual ocean tier, it would be easy for him to kill enemies who were four levels above him.</p><p>A grade-7 primary formation posed no threat to Luo Li.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The pitch-black demonic blade exuded a terrifying aura. The formation was shattered, and Lu Ming was swept by a blade gleam. The scales on his skin were shattered, and one of his arms was almost chopped off.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>On Lu Ming’s body, the array that had concealed his aura collapsed and his original aura was revealed.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming? Hahaha, my luck is not bad. If I kill you, the Supreme Leader of the Wang clan will reward me handsomely!”</p><p>Luo Li laughed as his demonic might surged. A terrifying saber radiance cut through everything, shattering the formation in front of him. The terrifying saber radiance then slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and two puppets rushed out. They were easily cut in half by the saber radiance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re out of luck to have run into me. You’ll die today!”</p><p>Ro li laughed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming waved his hands and more than ten puppets appeared, charging at Luo Li.</p><p>They were all at first and second rank of seventh level.</p><p>Behind the dozen or so puppets were nine puppets that looked like white birds. They followed the puppets in front of them and charged at ro li.</p><p>The remaining nine puppets were all at fourth grade seventh level.</p><p>This was the highest-grade puppet that Lu Ming had bought from the treasure Pavilion. He could not control it if he had not broken through to become a seventh-rank Alchemist.</p><p>Ro li slashed with his demonic blade, and the puppets in front of him were cut into pieces.</p><p>However, at this moment, the strongest puppet had arrived.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a word softly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
