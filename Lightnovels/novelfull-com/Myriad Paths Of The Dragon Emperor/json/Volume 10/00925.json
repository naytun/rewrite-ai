He grabbed with his claw and destroyed all the attacks of the talisman sect disciple. He grabbed the talisman sect disciple’s throat and lifted him up high.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you, don’t let me bump into him. Otherwise, I’ll make sure he dies without a burial ground!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord’s expression was extremely ferocious. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“You’d better let him go. Otherwise, I guarantee that you’ll be the one to die without a burial place!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. Lu Ming walked out of a small alley.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming zongzi!”</p><p>The talisman sect’s disciples revealed looks of joy.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>The little demon Lord spat out the two words word by word coldly, his voice extremely cold.</p><p>He was a little surprised. He did not expect to meet Lu Ming just as he mentioned him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and his gaze turned gloomy when he saw the talisman sect disciple who had been killed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, didn’t you want to save people? Let’s see how you’re going to save him! Hehe!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord sneered. He suddenly exerted force in his claws. With a crack, he crushed the talisman sect disciple in his claws to death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exploded with a violent aura. A cold killing intent burst out and enveloped the little demon Lord.</p><p>“Luo Li, you will die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely cold. He looked at the little demon Lord as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that you can kill me. I didn’t even use my full strength the last time. We don’t know who will win yet!”</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of the little demon Lord’s body, and a black demonic Qi rushed into the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, the five dragon energies in his body erupting at the same time. His body was covered in a thick layer of scales.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The word ” kill ” came out like a Thunderbolt. Lu Ming struck out with his palm and the space trembled.</p><p>“Nine deaths devil blade!”</p><p>A pitch-black saber appeared in the little demonic Lord’s hand, and a sharp Saber Light burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a huge boom, the little demon Lord’s body trembled and he staggered back.</p><p>“How can his strength be so terrifying?”</p><p>The little demon Lord’s face revealed a trace of shock.</p><p>In his previous battle with Lu Ming, Lu Ming did not burst out with five flashes of dragon energy.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and blasted out a violent force. His palm was like an immemorial divine mountain, containing infinite power, and he struck at the little demon Lord.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared and touched his chest. He let out a low growl. Then, the little demonic Lord’s body began to swell, and bone spikes extended from his arms and shoulders.</p><p>His aura also increased greatly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared and charged at Lu Ming like a demonic creature. With a wave of his hand, the bone spikes pierced through the air, making a sharp whistling sound as they stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The vital essence in his body roared and four types of intents swirled around. Lu Ming circulated the prison-suppressing heaven technique in his palm and continuously bombarded the little demon Lord.</p><p>The two of them were like a demon and a demon. They kept bombarding each other in a very direct way.</p><p>The entire area began to shake violently.</p><p>The surrounding palaces all heard it.</p><p>“There’s a huge battle going on. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>A burly young man was exploring one of the palaces. When he heard the commotion, he rushed towards the source of the sound.</p><p>There were also others who heard the commotion, but they didn’t dare to rush over. This was because the commotion was too shocking, and it exceeded their strength.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged dozens of moves with the little demon Lord.</p><p>Gradually, the little demon Lord was at a disadvantage while Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm hit the little demon Lord’s shoulder, breaking the bone spur on his shoulder and creating a huge wound. The little demon Lord let out an angry roar.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard. A burly young man appeared. His eyes were filled with ferocity and he bared his fangs.</p><p>“Brother Jin, let’s kill Lu Ming together!”</p><p>The little demon Lord was overjoyed to see this young man.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>The burly young man revealed a ferocious smile. In the next moment, he transformed into a huge Tiger and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the powerful heaven’s favorite from the sky demon Valley. He had 50% of the bloodline of the divine beast and his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord’s eyes revealed a malevolent look. A hideous-looking creature appeared above his head. It was a demonic creature with thick demonic Qi, a wide mouth with sharp fangs, and a body full of bone spikes.</p><p>There were five golden chakras shining around the demonic creature. This was the bloodline of the little demonic Lord, a fifth level divine bloodline.</p><p>The little demonic Lord turned into a ray of light and fused into his blood vessels. He had completely transformed into a demonic creature. Demonic Qi surged as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Nine Dragons! Lu Ming shouted. His nine Dragon bloodline appeared and he transformed into Nine Dragons, exuding a vast Dragon’s might.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The fierce Golden Tiger was shocked and felt a little scared.</p><p>The true dragon was the head of all beasts, and there were not many that could be compared to it.</p><p>Other divine beasts would instinctively feel reverence when facing a true dragon, let alone Nine Dragons.</p><p>The ferocious Golden Tiger was shocked. The nine Dragons ‘claws struck down and sent the ferocious Golden Tiger flying.</p><p>Following that, it struck out with its claw again, clashing with the little demon Lord’s move, causing him to stagger back.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, the Golden Tiger roused its spirits and roared loudly, pouncing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons. This is the legendary Nine Dragons. You’ve actually awakened the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Hand it over!</p><p>The Golden Tiger roared, its eyes filled with greed.</p><p>The nine Dragons were existences that were of a higher level than the true dragon. If he could take away Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline, even if he could not use it himself, he could offer it to the Supreme Being of the flood Dragon Tribe. He would definitely be rewarded handsomely.</p><p>At the same time, the little demonic Lord also rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>The nine dragon claws stepped in the air as if they were real Dragons, surveying the world and ruling it.</p><p>A terrifying Dragon’s might gushed out, and under the nine claws, a vast power erupted.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to the sixth step, which was equivalent to the highest level of a high-grade demigod martial technique. However, after transforming into the nine Dragons and performing it, the power was even more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two deafening sounds, the little demonic Lord and the Golden Tiger were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>A surge of energy gushed out in all directions. However, the palace seemed to be made of some kind of unique material that made it indestructible, and it was unknown whether it was inscribed with a formation or made of some kind of special material. The powerful energy that seemed to be able to pierce through the earth did not leave a single mark on the palace at all.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The little demon Lord cried out in disbelief.</p><p>He and the Golden Tiger were both at the fourth level spirit embryo realm, two levels higher than Lu Ming. The two of them had joined forces, but they were still at a disadvantage. How was this possible?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies and pounced at the little demon Lord.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a swipe of his claw, the little demon Lord spat out a large mouthful of blood, and more than a dozen of the hideous bone spikes on his body were broken.</p><p>“Join hands, join hands!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared and was a little flustered. He was not Lu Ming’s match at all.</p><p>On the other side, the Golden Tiger was a little frightened, but it still roared angrily and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a scroll flew out of the nine Dragons ‘forehead.</p><p>It was the mountain and river diagram!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
