Of course, it had been greatly weakened by the mountain and river diagram and could not cause any harm to Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>However, if it was someone stronger, such as the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, it might cause harm to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly. He ignored the attacks of the two eighth level spirit embryo realm three-eyed gods and focused on the seventh level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God.</p><p>The nine dragon claws were all using the prison suppressing heavenly art as they charged at each other.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party used his huge iron hammer to block but it was useless. The huge iron hammer was sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>The Dragon Claw grabbed the other party’s body. The other party roared and flew a hundred meters away. He spat out a large mouthful of blood, but he did not die.</p><p>the earth essence realm’s defensive power is indeed powerful. However, he still has to die!</p><p>The dragon’s claws stepped in the air, and with a twist of its body, it appeared in front of the opponent in an instant, clawing out again.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The claw pierced through his opponent and killed him. Lu Ming devoured all his blood essence and energy.</p><p>While Lu Ming was killing, screams could be heard from other directions.</p><p>The paragons of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley were all killed on the spot.</p><p>Some of them were peerless geniuses in the outside world. There were even God-level geniuses, but their lives were like grass and they were killed mercilessly.</p><p>Lu Ming saw Blood Sword Nine’s blood-colored sword light crisscrossing and his entire body suffused with blood Qi. He had killed a three-eyed God at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, but his head had been chopped off by an expert at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>The 63rd on the list of top 1000 talents had fallen.</p><p>“Go, retreat!”</p><p>“Go to those palaces!”</p><p>Brother Litian and the seventh sanguine swordsman roared and rushed out of the encirclement, rushing toward the palace.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were many wondrous things within those palaces that might be able to stop the three-eyed God race.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a saber cut through the void and slashed at the mountain and river diagram. The mountain and river diagram shook violently, and a powerful force poured into the bodies of the nine Dragons. It even cut open the scales of the nine Dragons and left a wound.</p><p>“Ninth level spirit embryo realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>One of them was at least six meters tall and was riding a huge Mount. He held a saber in his hand and looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He roared and his saber cut through the void, slashing at Lu Ming again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mountain and river diagram shook violently. A terrifying saber Qi passed through the mountain and river diagram and cut the bodies of the nine Dragons, leaving another wound.</p><p>the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm is too strong. Even the mountain and river diagram can’t block it. Retreat first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>In the spirit embryo realm, the gap between each stage was extremely huge. Only a rare person like him who cultivated a God-grade technique, had two God-grade bloodlines, and had extremely powerful bloodline martial techniques could cross five stages and kill an opponent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was helpless against an eighth level spirit embryo realm cultivator, while a ninth level spirit embryo realm cultivator could easily kill him.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and dashed toward the palaces.</p><p>The palace he had chosen was the one he had obtained the mountain and river diagram from. The strength of the puppets in the palace would change according to their cultivation level. Lu Ming believed that the three-eyed God would not be able to charge in.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The three-eyed God expert at the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm let out an angry roar.</p><p>A few three-eyed gods at the eighth tier of the spirit embryo realm kept on attacking Lu Ming, but they were all blocked by the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward with all his might, breaking through the obstacles and rushing into the palace. He then transformed into his human form and rushed forward.</p><p>In front of him, two puppets appeared. They glanced at Lu Ming with cold eyes and then stepped aside.</p><p>He seemed to have recognized Lu Ming and did not stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and rushed over.</p><p>Behind them, the other three-eyed gods rushed forward, but the puppets moved. They turned into terrifying attacks and charged towards the three-eyed gods. Lu Ming heard a blood-curdling scream. It seemed like one of the three-eyed gods had been killed.</p><p>As expected, the puppets here would adjust their strength according to the cultivation level of the people who entered.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the secret room below. Just like the last time, puppets appeared, but they gave way to Lu Ming after a quick glance.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at the passageway without any obstacles.</p><p>The puppets on both sides of the passage only glanced at Lu Ming and stood there without moving. Lu Ming’s path was smooth, and he arrived at the secret chamber where he had obtained the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh.</p><p>this place should be safe. Let’s refine the energy first!</p><p>He immediately sat down cross-legged and began refining.</p><p>This time, he had devoured quite a lot of energy and was constantly being refined.</p><p>I’ve made a breakthrough in the earth concept. It’s now at the peak of the second level!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>At the same time, the energy was constantly being refined and transformed into true essence, which poured into the spirit embryo.</p><p>In his dantian, his spirit embryo was beating as if it was nurturing a life.</p><p>As true essence poured in and was continuously condensed, the spirit embryo’s size was also slowly shrinking.</p><p>A day later, the aura on Lu Ming’s body surged.</p><p>Third level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>After refining this energy, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the third level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>the energy I devoured this time is just enough for me to break through to the third level of the spirit embryo realm. Inside, there are two three-eyed gods at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, five to six at the sixth level, and dozens of fifth level spirit embryo realm and below. That’s just enough for me to break through to the third level of the spirit embryo realm. The energy I need is so much!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>If he didn’t devour a third eye God of the seventh level spirit embryo realm, he wouldn’t be able to break through.</p><p>of the four intents, the earth intent has reached the peak of the second level beginning, while the Thunder and wind intents are still at the peak of the second level beginning. However, the wind intent has broken through and reached the lower tier of the second level. Most of the three-eyed gods I just killed cultivated the wind intent!</p><p>however, the bloodline of the nine Dragons hasn’t been upgraded. The amount of blood essence required is even more terrifying!</p><p>let’s go into the mountain and river diagram first to take a look at Chi Xue and the others. After that, I’ll stabilize my Foundation here, condense my true energy and will, and then break out of here.</p><p>His cultivation had increased by one level and he was now at the third level of the spirit embryo realm. With the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming was confident that he could break out of the encirclement and escape.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>As soon as he entered the mountain and river diagram, he saw Bai chixue and the other Talisman Amulet sect disciples flying around in the vast land. After a long time, some people finally noticed Lu Ming and gathered around him.</p><p>“Zongzi!”</p><p>“Lu Ming zongzi!”</p><p>The talisman sect disciples saluted Lu Ming.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with envy, shock, and gratitude.</p><p>They were envious of a treasure like the mountain and river diagram. However, Lu Ming had saved them time and time again. They were extremely grateful to him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this must be a Grotto-heaven treasure. I didn’t expect that there would be such a wondrous treasure in the world!”</p><p>Bai chixue also flew over and looked at Lu Ming with shock in her eyes.</p><p>This was simply a world of its own. Who wouldn’t be shocked?</p><p>boss, boss, you’re amazing! You even have such a treasure!</p><p>King Kong stepped on the void and rushed over. He looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Looking at Vajra’s appearance, the talisman sect disciples admired Lu Ming even more. He could even subdue the demon race’s prodigy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
