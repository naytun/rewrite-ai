However, his face was deathly pale, without a trace of blood. His body was covered with over a dozen sword wounds, blood flowing out of them. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>...</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Wang Yan did not dare to stay any longer. He turned into a streak of fire and rushed out of the canyon in a sorry state.</p><p>Compared to Wang Yan, the corpse puppet was in an even worse state. Although it had used all its means, one of its arms had still been cut off. It screeched as it escaped from the canyon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the canyon, the giant ape continued to clash with the formation.</p><p>This giant ape’s strength was truly astonishing. It was incomparably powerful, and with every punch, a large amount of sword Qi was shattered. Even if a few sword Qi occasionally struck the giant ape, they could only leave shallow marks on its surface.</p><p>this giant ape has at least 50% of the ancient giant ape’s bloodline. Its body is extremely strong. This formation won’t be able to hold it back for long. I’d better leave first!</p><p>With a flash of thought, Lu Ming stepped into the void, his body like a stream of light, leaving the place.</p><p>As expected, not long after Lu Ming left, the formation collapsed with a loud bang. The giant ape rushed out and let out an angry roar.</p><p>Then, it turned into a burly young man with killing intent in his eyes. He growled, ” “Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>With that, he strode out of the canyon.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and was extremely fast. After leaving the canyon, he chose a random direction and went forward. Not long after, he had traveled more than a hundred thousand miles and found a hidden mountain forest. He flew down and set up an array in the surroundings. Lu Ming began to refine the energy.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had devoured the blood essence and energy of the paragons, men of sacrifice, and even the demonic beasts who had died in the canyon.</p><p>He circulated the bloodline of the nine Dragons and continued to refine it.</p><p>I have the most earth and wind concepts. The other concepts are useless to me!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He directly removed the useless concepts and made the earth and wind concepts his own.</p><p>Most of the earth and wind concepts came from the death Warriors.</p><p>Those men of sacrifice with big hammers cultivated the earth mentality, and those with long swords mostly cultivated the wind mentality.</p><p>Lu Ming’s earth and wind concepts were rapidly improving.</p><p>Soon, his wind concept reached its limit, and he was only one step away from level three.</p><p>As for the earth concept, it had also reached the peak of level two upper tier.</p><p>As his intent realm improved, the true essence and other energies were also being refined and transformed into true essence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation started to increase. Not long after, the aura on his body grew and he broke through to the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm in one go. Furthermore, it continued to increase all the way to the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual ocean realm before it stopped.</p><p>It had been upgraded by one level in one go.</p><p>“Eh? There are impurities in my true Yuan and distracting thoughts in my intent realm!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He could feel that his true Yuan and intent weren’t pure. There were some obstacles when he tried to use them. Although the obstacles were weak, if this continued, it would be a big problem.</p><p>“I know. Other people’s Zhen Yuan and blood all have their own characteristics. I refined them, but there are still some of them left. It’s even more so for the will. Every will that I comprehend has a distinct will. After I refined them, there are still some of them left. This is very normal.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and discovered the problem.</p><p>He thought of his early days, when he often relied on devouring blood essence to improve his cultivation. Similarly, this would cause his cultivation Foundation to be unstable and he would need time to consolidate it.</p><p>Later on, he used all his blood essence to improve his bloodline and relied on devouring spiritual crystals and raw stones to improve his cultivation. He no longer had to worry about this.</p><p>Spiritual crystals and raw gemstones were all natural and extremely pure.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have to stop wasting time to cultivate every time I advance to the next realm. I’ll have to purify my true Yuan and intent realm to stabilize my Foundation!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming would not abandon the heaven-defying function of the nine Dragons bloodline just because of this small flaw. At most, he would just spend more time to stabilize it.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to condense his essential core and Polish his artistic conception.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. Lu Ming’s essential core and concept had become pure and condensed again.</p><p>the wind concept seems to be showing signs of a breakthrough!</p><p>The concept was pure. Lu Ming could feel that the wind concept seemed to have touched a wonderful realm.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued cultivating.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In a Canyon tens of thousands of miles away from Lu Ming, a shocking flame suddenly soared into the sky and a figure appeared in the flame.</p><p>This figure was Wang Yan.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve finally broken through to the spirit embryo realm. Lu Ming, the next time I see you will be the day of your death!”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed out loud, his aura extremely terrifying. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>After being injured by Lu Ming previously, not only had he fully recovered after more than ten days, but he had also broken through to the spirit embryo realm in one fell swoop, causing his strength to skyrocket.</p><p>that Lu Ming will definitely go to some strange places nearby to look for opportunities. This place is the closest to the double Moon Mountain. I’ll go to the double Moon Mountain and stop him halfway!</p><p>With that, Wang Yan’s figure flickered and he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In a dark cave, corpse Qi suddenly filled the air. The corpse puppet, carrying an ancient coffin, stepped out of the cave.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had used an array formation to cut off his arm. However, the shocking thing was that the corpse puppet’s arm was now intact, as if it had grown back. Furthermore, the aura on its body was extremely powerful. It was also the aura of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>that Lu Ming will definitely go to some secret places to seek opportunities. This place is the closest to the divine bird cliff. I’ll go to the divine bird cliff to stop him!</p><p>After saying that, the corpse puppet stepped out and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>At an unknown distance away from Lu Ming, there was a magnificent city. The city was filled with three-eyed gods.</p><p>&Nbsp; within a massive Palace, a few three-eyed gods were currently discussing some matters. These three-eyed gods were all tall and sturdy, and their auras were powerful.</p><p>“It’s been another twenty years, and another group of young people has come from the outside world to hunt down my clan. Damn it, they really think of my clan as a trial!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! a furious roar came from one of the three-eyed God race members.</p><p>Below, many of the three-eyed gods were trembling in fear, not daring to say a word.</p><p>according to the ancient records, in the outside world, our tribe is unrivaled, and the human tribe is nothing more than our tribe’s food. However, our ancestors were captured and brought here, and they made our tribe into the training targets of the human youths. This is absolutely not allowed. I will kill them all, not leaving a single one alive. Pass down my order, all the regions should organize an Army to capture and kill those human youths. Once they are found, kill them without mercy!</p><p>The three-eyed God above ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” yes, Your Majesty! the other three-eyed God race members also began to follow his orders.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was unaware of all these. He was still cultivating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another ten days had passed. Lu Ming had been in closed-door cultivation for twenty days.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and a faint smile appeared on his face.</p><p>The concept of wind had successfully broken through to the third level. This was Lu Ming’s first step towards the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>it’s been 20 days. The next step is to continue searching for those strange places and opportunities to obtain more fate value!</p><p>Lu Ming thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
