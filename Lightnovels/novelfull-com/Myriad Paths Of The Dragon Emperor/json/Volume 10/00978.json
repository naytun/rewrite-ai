How is it possible that Lu Ming is the successor of Emperor Cang?”</p><p>Emperor Cang has disappeared for three thousand years. Rumor has it that he died while wandering overseas. How could Lu Ming be the successor of Emperor Cang? ”</p><p>“Could it be that Emperor Liao Cang is still alive?”</p><p>Everyone was in shock. Someone even suggested that Lian Cang was still alive, which shocked everyone.</p><p>Emperor Liao Cang was the number one Alchemist in the eastern barren territory. His art of inscription was unparalleled. If he was still alive, it would be earth-shaking news. The situation of the entire Eastern barren territory would change dramatically.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes lit up like two divine swords, piercing the sky. His body was filled with a powerful killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you are Lian Cang’s disciple?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi spoke word by word, staring at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi fearlessly. His hand glowed and a scroll appeared in his hand. He said, ” “Di Yi, look at this.”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s eyes fell on the scroll in Lu Ming’s hand. He said coldly, ” “The all formation illustration, it seems like you have really received Lian Cang’s inheritance.”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the million formation illustration, and their hearts trembled.</p><p>The all-array diagram was the most powerful treasure of Emperor Liao Cang. Since Lu Ming had the all-array diagram, he must be Liao Cang’s successor.</p><p>The ones who were the most shocked were the elders and disciples of the talisman sect.</p><p>They stared at the myriad array diagram in Lu Ming’s hands in a daze. Their eyes were filled with excitement and disbelief.</p><p>“All array diagram!”</p><p>Huan Zhen, Wen Zhongyi, Bai chixue, Ji mai and the rest were all excited. Then, they came to a realization.</p><p>They finally knew why the patriarchs of the talisman Amulet sect had chosen Lu Ming as a zongzi candidate. It was because he was the inheritor of the divine cultivator Cang.</p><p>“MA … Master, is Grandmaster Lian Cang still alive?”</p><p>Bai chixue asked Bai Shijin with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Grandmaster Lian Cang won’t be coming back!” Bai Shijin sighed.</p><p>Bai Shijin then looked at Martial Emperor Di Yi again and said, ” Di Yi, Lu Ming is the successor of Grandmaster Liao Cang. He is the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect. You have harmed Grandmaster Liao Cang. Is it possible for us to hand Lu Ming over to you? ”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>His words were even more shocking. It was like a thunderclap that resounded in everyone’s mind.</p><p>Emperor Liao Cang was actually killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>At this moment, not only were the People of the Talisman Amulet sect shocked, but the disciples, elders, and even Supremes of the other three sects, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the sky demon Valley, and the heavenly corpse sect, were also shocked.</p><p>In the past, almost everyone believed that Emperor Liao Cang had died while adventuring overseas. This was because in the divine wilderness continent, it was extremely difficult to advance after reaching the martial Royal realm.</p><p>To a sovereign realm expert, the divine wilderness continent was too small and the environment was too poor. It was not suitable for cultivation.</p><p>If he wanted to continue improving, he would have to head overseas and search for a bigger continent with better conditions to cultivate on.</p><p>In history, there were many emperors who went overseas to cultivate and risk their lives, but they ended up dying overseas.</p><p>Everyone thought that Emperor Liao Cang had died overseas because of this.</p><p>He had never expected that Martial Emperor Di Yi had secretly harmed him.</p><p>In this case, the talisman sect and Martial Emperor Di Yi were mortal enemies. How could they hand Lu Ming over to Di Yi?</p><p>“Di Yi, did you really kill Lian Cang? You’re so scheming, what do you want to do?”</p><p>The demon Emperor of sky demon Valley stood up and stared at Di Yi with hostility.</p><p>Corpse Qi rolled around the corpse Emperor, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Demon Emperor, you’re being too nosy. Why do I need to explain anything to you?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi glanced at the demon Emperor coldly. He was extremely domineering and did not give the demon Emperor any face at all.</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Lu Ming, then at Bai Shijin and the rest.”Since that’s the case, the symbol puppet sect shall be destroyed!”</p><p>With that, Di Yi turned around and strode away. He stepped into the teleportation vortex and disappeared.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, I’ll let you live for the time being, but let’s see how long you can live for?”</p><p>The master of the Wang family glared at Lu Ming coldly and turned to leave.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew out from the Emperor heaven divine Palace and into the talisman Amulet sect’s territory.</p><p>It was Wang haoxian.</p><p>“Evil creature, what are you doing? Get back here!”</p><p>shut up! the master of the Wang family shouted.</p><p>if I go back to the Wang family, I’ll definitely be in a miserable state. Why should I go back with you? ”</p><p>Wang haoxian’s face darkened.</p><p>Even if she were to die, she would never return to the Wang family.</p><p>She knew very well that if she were to return to the Wang family this time, she would definitely be in a miserable state.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward to Wang haoxian’s side and said, ” “There’s no need to go back, come with me to the talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>“Evil creature! You dare to betray the family?”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan berated.</p><p>“Hahaha, Wang Shengtian, this girl will not have a good ending if she goes back. Only an idiot would go back with you.”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed and said, ” my brother is really something. He even managed to Seduce The Heaven’s favorite of your Wang clan. Wang Shengtian, do you feel good now? haha!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan roared. His face was flushed red and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Evil creature, you dare to betray the family. Sooner or later, I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death. Let’s see who can protect you!”</p><p>shut up! the master of the Wang family shouted. He no longer had the face to stay and strode away, stepping into the teleportation vortex.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’re also going back!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others shouted.</p><p>Immediately, everyone from the talisman Amulet sect stepped into the teleportation vortex and returned to the sect.</p><p>The people of the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley had also left.</p><p>The battle of Providence had finally come to an end.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the vortex. There was a flash of light and he was back at the entrance of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>As soon as he returned to the talisman Amulet sect, Lu Ming took to the air. As expected, he saw a group of people not far away.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and immediately flew over.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s parents, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping were among the crowd.</p><p>There was also Lin Xueyi, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, as well as some elders and disciples.</p><p>There were also Hua Chi, pang Shi, and the rest. Lu Ming’s two in-name disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou, were also there.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had secretly passed the mountain and river diagram to Bai Shijin to ask for his help to head to the blazing sun Empire and bring his parents and some close friends to the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>He knew that after the battle of Providence, Martial Emperor Di Yi would most likely attack him and not let him off. It was too dangerous for his family and friends to be in the territory of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. Lu Ming could only be at ease if he brought them to the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>The Supreme-being was rushing at full speed, and his speed was terrifying. It only took him one or two hours to pick up the person.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was finally at ease.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before Lu Ming arrived, a figure rushed toward him and landed on his shoulder.</p><p>It was dandan.</p><p>just now, luck was on your side. Lu Ming, I saw that your parents got the most. Lu Ming, what rank did you get? ”</p><p>Dandan asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming got first place!”</p><p>Behind him, Bai Shijing, Yan kuangtu, and the rest stepped into the air and answered on Lu Ming’s behalf.</p><p>as expected, not bad, kid. You have some of my style back in the day!</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
