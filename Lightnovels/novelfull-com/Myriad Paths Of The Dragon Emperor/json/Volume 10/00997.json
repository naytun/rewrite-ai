I’m doing this for the sake of the Xiao family!” Xiao Hongyun frowned.</p><p>...</p><p>“For the Xiao clan? I think you’re doing this for yourself, for your son!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan roared.</p><p>“Father, ning ‘er is also your grandson!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said with a frown.</p><p>“Grandson? I don’t have to bend my knees all day, using my family to exchange for my grandson’s future. Without the backbone of a martial artist, how can I have any achievements?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan shouted.</p><p>These words made desolate ning’s face turn extremely ugly. His eyes were flashing with a fierce light.</p><p>old man, I advise you to be sensible. This time, young master yunkong has already said that you must take these two girls back. If you stop him, you’re not giving face to young master yunkong and our floating mountain sect!</p><p>At this moment, Ling Kai spoke, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Young hero, I don’t have the idea of not giving face to the floating mountain martial school, nor do I dare to. However, love is a matter of mutual affection. Since my two granddaughters have no interest in young master yunkong, why do you have to force it?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan said.</p><p>feelings need to be cultivated. I’ll bring them back and get along with young master yunkong for a while. Then, we’ll have feelings for each other!</p><p>Ling Kai sneered.</p><p>“Young master yunkong, can you officially marry the two girls?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan said.</p><p>Ling Kai frowned and said coldly,”enough, old man. Who do these two girls think they are?” It’s already a great fortune to be able to Scout young master yunkong, and you still want to marry him as the official wife? are you dreaming?”</p><p>“Alright, old man, get out of the way!”</p><p>After saying that, Ling Kai’s eyes were like lightning, and his aura was threatening.</p><p>Second level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Ling Kai’s cultivation had already reached the second level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>At Ling Kai’s age, he was obviously a genius to be able to reach this level of cultivation.</p><p>“No, you are the disciples of the floating mountain martial school, do you want to Rob me?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan walked to the side of a ‘ke and a’ Lei, firmly blocking the two.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>A ‘ke and a’ Lei’s eyes were filled with fear as they clutched Xiao Zhan’s arm tightly.</p><p>“Ah Zhen, ah Lei, don’t be afraid. Grandpa is here!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan consoled her as a powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>Although Xiao Zhan had not fully recovered, the strength of his aura was not weaker than that of a third level spirit embryo realm cultivator.</p><p>The other disciples of the Xiao family who had followed Xiao Zhan out also stood beside him, staring at the disciples of the floating mountain martial school.</p><p>old man, it seems like you’re asking for it the hard way. How dare your ant-like Xiao family go against young master yunkong? you’re really looking for death!</p><p>Ling Kai’s eyes glinted coldly. He took a step forward, and the aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>Although his cultivation level was lower than Xiao Zhan’s, his aura was extremely strong, and he was actually able to suppress Xiao Zhan.</p><p>This was the strength of a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Xiao Zhan stared at Ling Kai with a serious expression. His whole body was tense, as if he would suffer a storm of attacks from Ling Kai at any time.</p><p>I’ll count to three. If you don’t hand him over, I’ll kill one person from your Xiao family in one breath. Three!</p><p>Ling Kai said coldly.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, the Xiao sisters, and the other members of the Xiao family all had ugly expressions on their faces. Ling Kai was too overbearing.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Ling Kai said.</p><p>In the surroundings, the others were silent. This was Ling yunkong’s matter. Ling yunkong was one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain sect. Who would dare to interfere?</p><p>The faces of Xiao Zhan and the others turned even uglier. Xiao Zhan clenched his fists but did not say anything.</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Ling Kai uttered the word ‘one’, and then his killing intent rose.</p><p>it seems like he’s not handing it over. He’s looking for death. Kill him!</p><p>With a wave of Ling Kai’s hand, a young man beside him stepped forward and shot out like a bolt of lightning. A sword light cut through the void and stabbed at a Xiao family disciple.</p><p>It was so fast that the Xiao family disciple didn’t even have time to react. The next moment, everyone saw a head fly high into the air with blood spurting out.</p><p>A Xiao clan disciple was killed without being able to put up any resistance.</p><p>The young man from the floating mountain sect who had attacked was a first level spirit embryo realm cultivator.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan roared like a wild lion, his eyes burning with anger.</p><p>However, he was suppressed by Ling Kai’s powerful aura and could not help at all.</p><p>Once he made a move, ah Luo and her sister would be taken away by Ling Kai.</p><p>“It seems like I’m not handing it over? Kill!”</p><p>Ling Kai’s voice continued.</p><p>A sword light flashed, and a blood-curdling screech was heard. Another Xiao family disciple was killed.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s eyes were about to spit fire.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning stood at the side, their eyes cold and indifferent.</p><p>no, don’t kill us. We’ll go with you!</p><p>The sisters ‘eyes were filled with tears. At this time, ah Luo shouted.</p><p>“No, Grandpa can’t send you into the Tiger’s mouth. Otherwise, how can I face your parents?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan roared, his eyes red.</p><p>old man, I think you really want to die. Kill, continue killing, until you kill all the people of the Xiao family. I don’t believe that he will dare to not hand over today. Today, I will kill him until he hands over!</p><p>Ling Kai shouted, full of killing intent.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light burst out again, but this time, there was no scream, because the hand holding the sword was grabbed.</p><p>A black-robed young man suddenly appeared in front of the young man from the floating mountain martial school and grabbed his wrist.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The black-robed youth said coldly.</p><p>“Big brother Lu!”</p><p>A-Qing exclaimed.</p><p>The black-robed young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>little brother Lu, let’s go! This has nothing to do with you!</p><p>Seeing that it was Lu Ming, Xiao Zhan didn’t look happy. Instead, he told Lu Ming to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming looked like he was in his twenties, and the other party was a colossal being like the floating mountain sect. Ling yunkong was one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain sect. Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>He was indebted to Lu Ming and he did not want to drag Lu Ming into this.</p><p>As expected, Ling Kai’s eyes darkened.</p><p>The young man whose wrist was being held by Lu Ming had a murderous look in his eyes. He berated, ” “Brat, you dare to sneak attack me? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>His essential core burst forth and a black light flashed. The young man intended to push Lu Ming away and kill him with one strike.</p><p>Kachacha!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his wrist and the young man’s arm twisted and trembled like a piece of dough, emitting the sound of bones breaking. He let out a blood-curdling screech and flew far away, landing heavily on the ground. He was wailing like a wild dog that was about to die.</p><p>The surroundings suddenly fell silent, and many people were shocked.</p><p>The youth from the floating mountain sect was not weak. He had a cultivation of the first level spirit embryo realm. Although he could not be considered a prodigy, he was considered one of the best among the first level spirit embryo realm. Yet, he could not even block one move from Lu Ming.</p><p>Who was Lu Ming? How could he be so strong?</p><p>Ah ke and ah Lei’s small mouths were slightly open, and they were a little stunned.</p><p>They had originally thought that Lu Ming’s abilities were about the same as theirs, at most a little stronger. They did not expect that an expert of the first level spirit embryo realm would be easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>A trace of surprise flashed through Xiao Zhan’s eyes, but he still looked serious.</p><p>A first level spirit embryo realm martial artist was nothing, but Ling Kai was at the peak of the second level spirit embryo realm and was a heaven’s favorite. He was not someone that the youth from before could compare to.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to launch a sneak attack and injure a disciple of my floating mountain martial school. I think you’ve eaten the true Dragon’s bile. I’ll give you a chance now. Kneel down, kowtow and admit your mistake. Then, destroy your own cultivation and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>Ling Kai said darkly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
