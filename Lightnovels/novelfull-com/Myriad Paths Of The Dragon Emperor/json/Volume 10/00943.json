He rushed over and started a battle with the giant crab.</p><p>...</p><p>The giant crab was very powerful. It was definitely not weaker than the Golden pool. In fact, it was even stronger. However, most of the giant crab’s power was concentrated on the poisonous gas. To others, it was a fatal threat. To Lu Ming, however, he could ignore it.</p><p>Moreover, the giant crab was severely injured and its strength had been greatly reduced. In this way, Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming had the upper hand, it was still very difficult for him to kill the giant crab.</p><p>The cave was filled with continuous rumbles. Lu Ming used all his strength to fight the giant crab. After a few hundred moves, he finally killed it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming himself was also severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out a Jade bottle. The Jade bottle contained the elixir of life.</p><p>He poured out two drops and swallowed them.</p><p>At the same time, he took out a pile of raw gemstones and let the bloodline of the nine Dragons devour them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were recovering at an alarming rate. In a few minutes, his injuries were completely healed.</p><p>“The elixir of life is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt it.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming’s essential core had fully recovered. He looked at the glowing hole.</p><p>The totem pole, is it inside?</p><p>Lu Ming walked over carefully and stepped into the cave.</p><p>It was a passageway. The light came from the front and the passageway was more than a hundred meters long. After passing through the passageway, Lu Ming came to another huge cave.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised when he arrived at the cave.</p><p>This was because there was no trace of poisonous gas in this cave. Instead, it was filled with extremely rich heaven and earth spiritual Qi. In fact, there was even some heaven and earth origin Qi in the heaven and earth spiritual Qi. This Qi was exactly the same as the one in the raw gemstone. It was called origin Qi.</p><p>This cave and the sky Poison Island were simply two different worlds.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, he saw a burly figure sitting cross-legged in the corner of the cave.</p><p>This figure was clearly a three-eyed God, but this three-eyed God looked extremely old. His scales had all fallen off, and his two horns were dull and lifeless.</p><p>However, there was still a faint aura of life on his body.</p><p>And beside this three-eyed God, there were many skeletons. These were all thick bone banners, and it was obvious that they were left behind by the three-eyed God race.</p><p>At this moment, the three-eyed God suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>the 20-year period is up again. You humans are here again!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” let’s go! an ancient voice boomed out of the three-eyed God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn as he sized up the three-eyed God.</p><p>This three-eyed God seemed to be very old and was about to die. The aura on his body was very weak and posed no threat to Lu Ming. Only then did Lu Ming feel relieved.</p><p>“Human youth, what’s wrong? You’re still afraid of me, a dying man?”</p><p>The old three-eyed man said.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>According to what he knew, there were some ruins here that the three-eyed God race couldn’t enter at all. If they entered, they would definitely die. Moreover, this was one of the nine great Forbidden Lands, so how did the three-eyed God race get in?</p><p>Could it be that the three-eyed God race can enter the sky Poison Island?</p><p>“Haha, how did I get in? Do you think I wanted to come in but was forced to? this world doesn’t allow the existence of beings above the spiritual God Realm. We’re just a trial for your human race!”</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God let out a low roar.</p><p>“What do you know?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He had always felt that there was a powerful existence behind all this. The battle of Providence was really like a place for them to train.</p><p>Who was controlling everything from behind the scenes?</p><p>“Do you want to know? I can tell you!”</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming did not speak. He listened quietly and remained cautious.</p><p>Although this old three-eyed God’s aura was weak, Lu Ming still did not dare to be careless.</p><p>according to the ancient records, our three-eyed God race is extremely powerful and dominates the world. Outside of this world, you humans are nothing more than losers to our three-eyed God race, nothing more than our dogs!</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming still did not say anything. The old three-eyed God continued.</p><p>in this world, a long time ago, the remaining powerful beings of the human race captured a group of my three-eyed God race and placed them in this world for my race to reproduce. Then, they used them to cultivate the geniuses of the human race. You tried to cultivate a peerless genius that could contend against my three-eyed God race in the outside world. Hehe, what a fool’s dream!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. What was the outside world that the old three-eyed God was talking about? It should not be the world that Lu Ming was in. Could it be heaven?</p><p>Back then, the three-eyed God race had appeared on that small island in the heaven realm, and they had even said that they wanted to attack the primordial realm.</p><p>Could it be that the battle of Providence was being controlled by a mighty figure from the heaven realm?</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had many thoughts in his heart.</p><p>therefore, in this world, it is impossible for anyone above the spiritual God Realm to appear. As long as someone from my clan breaks through to the spiritual God Realm, they will be suppressed or even killed. I was suppressed by the laws of heaven and earth when I broke through to the spiritual God Realm. I escaped here with a serious injury. So, don’t worry, I am not a threat to you!</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God continued.</p><p>“No more?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s all. It’s been too long, and I only know this much? Boy, I’m just struggling on my last breath, suffering every day. Since I’ve said so much, come and get rid of me, and let me be free!”</p><p>The ancient three-eyed God sighed.</p><p>“Kill you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve been dragging my broken body and suffering every day. I’d rather die. How about you help me with this? ”</p><p>The three-eyed man said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he strode toward the three-eyed God. A long spear materialized in his hand and he aimed it at the three-eyed God.</p><p>Right at this moment, the old three-eyed God’s lips curled into a cold smile. In the next moment, a black shadow rushed out from his dantian and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“I knew you would be like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and retreated quickly. The mountain and river diagram circled around him as he threw a punch.</p><p>The terrifying force of the punch landed on the shadow. The shadow let out a shrill cry. Although it dispersed, it condensed again in the next moment and continued to charge at Lu Ming. However, it was blocked by the mountain and river diagram. With a shake, it was sent flying.</p><p>“This is the spirit God!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>It was only now that he was able to clearly see the appearance of the shadow. It was actually a miniature three-eyed God, and it looked exactly like the ancient three-eyed God. This was clearly the spirit God that the ancient three-eyed God had condensed.</p><p>This three-eyed God had almost stepped into the spiritual God Realm, but it was a pity that he was suppressed.</p><p>a half-finished spiritual God is about to disappear. Since you want to kill me, I’ll fulfill your wish and kill you once and for all!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and continued to punch out with both his fists. One after another, his fists flew towards the spiritual God of the three-eyed God race.</p><p>The spiritual God tried to Dodge, but there were too many fist radiances. It was impossible for it to Dodge all of them. It was struck by the fist radiances, and with every punch, the spiritual God would dissipate. Then, it would reform and become weaker.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
