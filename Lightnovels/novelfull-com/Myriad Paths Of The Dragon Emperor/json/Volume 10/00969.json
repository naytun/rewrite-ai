When ao tu and Dongfang Yu descended from the sky, two beams of light shot out. One landed on the sky corpse sect’s corpse warrior, while the other landed on the divine Emperor.</p><p>...</p><p>The Emperor God was about to fight.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was highly focused.</p><p>The Emperor God was considered the top genius in the East barren. How powerful was he?</p><p>In the battle for Providence, he had not met any decent opponents. Those who had encountered him were all easily killed. His strength was simply unfathomable in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Now, could corpse warrior, ranked fourth on the list of top 1000 talents, force the Emperor God to show his true strength?</p><p>Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>Even Lu Ming was in high spirits.</p><p>In his mind, the Emperor God was his ultimate opponent.</p><p>Two figures landed on the fighting ring. Shi Zhan’s eyes were filled with solemness.</p><p>“Just admit defeat!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>He was straight and handsome. Just by standing there, he had the aura of a King. There was a kind of aura that could swallow the world and was invincible.</p><p>Yes, the Emperor God had never been defeated by the younger generation.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite who had the potential to become an Emperor in the future.</p><p>The last heaven’s favorite who was thought to have the potential to become an Emperor was Yan kuangtu, and that had been a hundred years ago.</p><p>He was telling the corpse warrior to admit defeat.</p><p>in my heart, I’ve never admitted defeat. Even if it’s you, God Emperor!</p><p>A strong battle intent appeared in the eyes of the corpse warrior.</p><p>“I’ll defeat you in ten moves!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s indifferent voice was filled with great confidence.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, and a shocking sword Qi burst out from his body and shot into the sky.</p><p>A terrifying sword power spread out towards corpse battle.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, corpse warrior directly burst out his bloodline.</p><p>It was a skeleton, a huge skeleton shaped like a huge elephant.</p><p>“The skeleton of an ancient war elephant!”</p><p>Someone muttered as he recognized the skeleton.</p><p>It was a skeleton formed by a powerful divine beast with seven golden Chakra Rings.</p><p>It was also a divine level rank 7 bloodline.</p><p>Shi Zhan performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a skeleton of an ancient war elephant. He stepped on the ground and attacked the Emperor God with amazing power.</p><p>However, the Emperor God’s eyes were still calm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out as a purple-gold sword light shot into the sky. It was filled with a luxurious aura.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The purple-gold sword Qi crossed dozens of miles and slashed at the ancient war elephant skeleton.</p><p>With a terrifying boom, the sword Qi shot out in all directions, and the ancient war elephant skeleton was forced to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of the sword rang out continuously, and sword Qi burst out one after another. Each one was more terrifying than the previous one, and it continuously slashed towards the ancient war elephant skeleton.</p><p>The ancient war elephant roared and used all its strength to fight against the Emperor God’s sword Qi.</p><p>However, with every strike it received, it would be forced back five miles. After nine strikes, the ancient war elephant had retreated nearly 50 miles.</p><p>Then, with a bang, the ancient war elephant exploded and turned back into a corpse warrior. The corpse warrior’s face was pale and he spat out blood. His body trembled as if he couldn’t even stand.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>Corpse warrior heaved a long sigh.</p><p>With corpse warrior’s surrender, everyone heaved a sigh of relief and looked at the Emperor God in shock.</p><p>He was too powerful. The Emperor God was too powerful.</p><p>He said that he would defeat the corpse in ten moves, and he really only used ten moves from start to finish, and the corpse admitted defeat.</p><p>The Emperor God hadn’t even performed the bloodline fusion.</p><p>the Emperor God is too powerful. No one can defeat him. Even ao tu and Xue Jianyi are no match for him!</p><p>that’s right. Until now, I don’t even know how much combat strength he has used. It’s truly terrifying and unfathomable!</p><p>……</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock. Even the Supreme-beings could no longer remain calm.</p><p>Only the Three Sovereigns remained calm.</p><p>On the grandstand, Xue Jian Yi and ao tu’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you confident in defeating the Emperor gods?”</p><p>Du songjue asked Lu Ming in a low voice.</p><p>“I’m not confident!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>He wasn’t confident. Even if he used all his power, he still wouldn’t be confident.</p><p>Corpse warrior’s combat strength was no weaker than Wang fentian’s, but he was still easily defeated by the Emperor God. His combat strength was simply unfathomable.</p><p>his cultivation should still be at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, but he should have reached the peak of the eighth level. However, I’m not too sure about the martial techniques he cultivates and the level of his bloodline!</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“You’ve been in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace for so many years, yet you’re still not clear about this?”</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>Yan kuangtu shook his head and said, ” di Shen has been secretly trained by Di Yi. I know little about him. Lu Ming, if you really can’t defeat di Shen, just admit defeat!</p><p>Finally, Yan kuangtu said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed but he did not answer.</p><p>“Are you really no match for him? What if I make another breakthrough?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>unfortunately, I’m still a little short. It’s getting harder and harder to raise my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons continued to refine Wang fentian’s blood essence. At this time, the refinement was almost complete, but his cultivation was still at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>According to Yan kuangtu, the Emperor God’s cultivation was at the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation also broke through to the eighth level spirit embryo realm, he would be more confident.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that he was not afraid of anyone at the same level.</p><p>“Then let’s start refining the raw gemstones!”</p><p>At the thought of this, a large number of raw gemstones appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The devouring power in his palms burst forth and devoured the large number of raw gemstones, starting to refine them.</p><p>The Emperor God won and took 90% of corpse warrior’s luck, returning to the stands.</p><p>The next battle was between Blood Sword one and Feng Xuan of the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Feng Xuan of the sky demon Valley had the Phoenix bloodline and had also reached more than 70% of her power. She was extremely powerful and fast. She was fighting against Xue Jian Yi at the peak.</p><p>This battle could be said to be the most intense of the four.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a full 200 moves before the victor was decided.</p><p>In the end, Blood Sword one won by a small margin.</p><p>At this point, the strongest top four had appeared.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, the Emperor God, ao tu, and blood Sword one.</p><p>Next, it was the battle between the four of them.</p><p>After these few battles, Lu Ming had a rough idea of everyone’s abilities.</p><p>Dongfang Yu, corpse warrior, and Wang fentian’s strength were very close and on the same level.</p><p>As for Feng Xuan, she was slightly stronger than the three of them, not much weaker than Blood Sword one.</p><p>Blood Sword one, ao tu, and Feng Xuan should be on the same level.</p><p>On the other hand, the Emperor God was unfathomable and difficult to predict.</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were similar to most of the people.</p><p>In other people’s hearts, Lu Ming’s abilities were placed on the same level as Blood Sword one, ao tu, and Feng Xuan.</p><p>Lu Ming could kill Wang fentian, but if Blood Sword one, ao tu, and the others were to unleash their full power, they could also kill Wang fentian.</p><p>However, there was no doubt that the Emperor God was placed in the most powerful position.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
