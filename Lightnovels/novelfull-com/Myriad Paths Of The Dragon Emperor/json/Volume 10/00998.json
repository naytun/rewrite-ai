I didn’t expect that their disciples would be so pathetic. They actually dared to snatch a famous girl. How disappointing!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sighed.</p><p>Ling Kai’s face was dark. He shouted, ” kid, you dare to look down on the floating mountain martial school. You have no chance to live now. You will die!</p><p>“What do you mean by contempt? If the people of the floating mountain sect are like you or Ling yunkong, I think they are not far from destruction!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly with a faint smile.</p><p>The hearts of the people around twitched, and they gasped.</p><p>This Lu Ming was too bold. He actually dared to say such things about Ling yunkong and the floating mountain.</p><p>Although they thought the same in their hearts, they didn’t dare to say a word.</p><p>“What a big mouth! What kind of trash are you? how dare you criticize young master yunkong and the floating mountain? kill him! Kill him!”</p><p>Ling Kai said coldly and waved his hand.</p><p>Behind him, five young men rushed out at the same time, and five long swords were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>These five youths were the same as the previous one, in their early thirties. They couldn’t be considered prodigies, but their combat strength wasn’t weak either. They were all experts of the first level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. The central continent was indeed the center of the divine wilderness continent. It was a Holy Land for cultivation and there were many experts.</p><p>There weren’t many in the eastern barren territory who had reached the spirit embryo realm in their thirties, but they had encountered one after another here.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a word and a long spear appeared in his hand. The long spear trembled and five spearlights appeared, stabbing at the five young men.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The five young men screamed and quickly retreated.</p><p>A bloody hole appeared on each of their shoulders, and blood flowed out.</p><p>The five young men’s faces were pale and their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s spear gleam had been aimed at their throats, they would have been dead.</p><p>“Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his eyes like lightning as he stared at Ling Kai.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Not only did Ling Kai not retreat, but his killing intent grew even stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A big fish appeared above Ling Kai’s head.</p><p>This fish was extremely ferocious. It was like a battle sword. It had a slender body and a fierce look in its eyes.</p><p>The ancient swordfish was Ling Kai’s bloodline. On it, three golden chakra shone. Ling Kai was an expert who had awakened a third level divine level bloodline and was a prodigy among prodigies. Even though Lu Ming’s combat strength was not weak, he was not afraid.</p><p>With his combat power, it was enough to deal with a fourth level spirit embryo realm expert.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sword radiance burst out from Ling Kai’s hands, and countless sword Qi shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With a shake of the spear, the space buzzed and endless spear radiance appeared.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The rapid sound of metal clashing rang out, extremely dense, and rang out for a few hundred times. Then, Ling Kai’s figure retreated rapidly. Several holes appeared on his body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>His face was pale and extremely gloomy.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had been merciful. However, Ling Kai was not grateful. Instead, he felt even more resentful.</p><p>In his heart, Lu Ming did not dare to kill him because he was a member of the floating mountain sect. It was only natural that Lu Ming would not kill him. However, Lu Ming had injured him and embarrassed him. If he could not answer to Ling yunkong when he returned, it would be a great sin.</p><p>“Brat, just you wait, just you wait!”</p><p>go! Ling Kai roared and turned around with the others, turning into a few sword lights and disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. If he was alone, he would not mind killing these pieces of trash. He would not even frown. However, he had to take the Xiao family into consideration. That was why he showed mercy.</p><p>A ‘Zhen, a’ Lei, and Xiao Zhan were a little dazed.</p><p>They did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful that even Ling Kai was no match for him and was easily defeated.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning were also dumbfounded, but at the same time, their expressions were extremely ugly.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you to injure a heaven’s pride expert of the floating mountain sect. It’s fine if you want to die, but don’t drag our Xiao family into this!”</p><p>At this moment, desolate ning strode out with a gloomy face. He pointed at Lu Ming and cursed.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and a murderous intent flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>shut up! Little brother Lu is trying to save us!</p><p>Xiao Zhan scolded.</p><p>“Grandpa, you’re old and muddle-headed. What do you mean save us? you’re clearly trying to harm us. Letting Ling Kai take ah Lei and ah Zhen away was the best choice. That way, our Xiao family would have a bright future. Now, it’s all ruined by this kid. Our Xiao family is going to be in deep trouble.”</p><p>Desolate ning shouted, his face twisted.</p><p>“You … You … Evil beast!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan glared at Xiao ning, his body trembling with anger.</p><p>“Ning ‘er is right. Little brat, I knew you didn’t have any good intentions. You framed our Xiao family, and now you’ve offended young master Ling yunkong. We’re all going to be in trouble!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun stepped forward and said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, setting up your Xiao family and bringing disaster upon your family? Laughable, truly laughable, who was the one who killed the Xiao clan’s disciple just now? Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning were truly shameless.</p><p>Just now, when the disciples of the floating mountain martial school killed several people from the Xiao family, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning did not even say a word. Now that Lu Ming had helped the Xiao family to repel Ling Kai and the others, these two people jumped out and accused him. Was there such a ridiculous thing in the world?</p><p>“What’s the big deal with the death of a few Xiao family’s trash? Who told them to be so disobedient!”</p><p>Desolate ning sneered.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Xiao ning’s face with the back of his hand. Xiao ning spun dozens of times in the air and then fell heavily to the ground. His face was swollen like a pig’s head and he looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to hit him?</p><p>“In my eyes, you’re also a piece of trash. Why don’t you just go and die?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at desolate ning and said coldly.</p><p>“How dare you! I’ll take you down right now, destroy your cultivation, and send you to apologize to young master Ling yunkong!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun bellowed as the aura on his body burst forth. He took a step forward and charged toward Lu Ming, sending a palm strike at him.</p><p>Fifth level of the spirit embryo realm. Xiao Hongyun’s cultivation had reached the fifth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>With his cultivation, he could have stopped Ling Kai earlier. However, he did not move at all earlier and now he wanted to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan shouted in anger. He had never thought that Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning would be so shameless. He was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>However, his cultivation had yet to fully recover. It was too late to stop Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move in the face of Xiao Hongyun’s palm. It was as if he had no intention of retaliating.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s heart skipped a beat as he had a bad feeling.</p><p>this kid is so young and I’ve never heard of his name. I don’t believe that he’s my match!</p><p>With that thought in mind, Xiao Hongyun’s palm force grew stronger and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Just as the palm force was about to hit Lu Ming, Lu Ming moved his feet slightly and dodged Xiao Hongyun’s palm. At the same time, Lu Ming stretched out his palm and grabbed Xiao Hongyun’s face, pressing it against the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled as Xiao Hongyun’s face came into close contact with the ground, creating a huge pit in the ground. Smoke and dust filled the air.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun let out a terrible scream, like a lazy toad that had been stepped on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
