It wailed and its eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>With a final cry, the Phoenix turned around and ran. It turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the distance.</p><p>Nangong Bo had escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. Nangong Bo’s combat strength was very strong, and his cultivation was two levels higher than his. Even if Lu Ming could win, it would not be easy to kill Nangong Bo.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Nangong Bo’s escape caused the people of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to be in a state of chaos. Each and every one of them cried out in fear and wanted to escape.</p><p>However, the inscriptions around them glowed and a formation appeared, trapping them.</p><p>Wen zhishi, Gong Fei, Meng Jia, and Ji mai attacked at the same time, trapping them in the area.</p><p>Lu Ming, who had transformed into the nine Dragons, took a step forward and appeared in front of Wang Chen. He looked at him coldly.</p><p>“No, no, damn it!”</p><p>Wang Chen was terrified, his entire body emitting cold air.</p><p>He had never expected Lu Ming to be so terrifying that even Nangong Bo was not his match. He was seriously injured by Lu Ming and had to escape alone.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his full strength in the battle with him just now.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed with his claws.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Although Wang Chen tried his best to resist, one of his arms was still torn off. He screamed in pain, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed back into his human form. He stepped forward and punched out with both fists.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Wang Chen was completely unable to resist and was severely injured. In the end, Lu Ming punched his dantian, shattering his spirit embryo and turning it into a waste.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Wang Chen screamed hysterically, his voice filled with despair and hatred.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die a horrible death. How dare you offend the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and his Majesty, the Martial Emperor? after the battle of Providence is over, you’ll definitely die at His Majesty’s hands. You definitely will!”</p><p>Wang Chen let out a venomous cry.</p><p>With his cultivation crippled, he knew that he was finished. Even if Lu Ming did not kill him, he would die in this world.</p><p>Wang haoxian, if he wants to kill you, then I’ll let you kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Wang haoxian.</p><p>Wang haoxian stepped on the air and formed a long Sword of Fire in his hand. He looked at Wang Chen with a murderous look.</p><p>“Wang haoxian, you b * tch! You betrayed the Wang family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. You will die sooner or later!”</p><p>Wang Chen shouted.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light slashed across, and Wang Chen’s head flew far away.</p><p>“Ah, no, spare me, spare me!”</p><p>“I don’t want to die!”</p><p>The other paragons of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace started to beg for mercy.</p><p>However, Wen Zhongli and the rest did not show any mercy. A formation appeared and not long after, everyone from the Emperor heaven divine Palace was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the bloodline of the nine Dragons and devoured the blood essence of the disciples of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, turning them into dried corpses.</p><p>Wen Qinyi and the rest looked at Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian in shock.</p><p>It was the first time they had seen such a domineering bloodline.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you very much for this!”</p><p>Wen zhishi stepped forward and cupped his fists.</p><p>On the side, Gong Fei and the Meng family members bowed in unison.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with surprise and even shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He had completely surpassed them.</p><p>Now, in terms of combat strength alone, Lu Ming could be ranked in the top few among the 14 candidates of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>There were only a few who could surpass Lu Ming.</p><p>The key was that Lu Ming had improved too quickly. If this continued, he would surpass most of the people and be on par with Huan Zhen.</p><p>you’re too kind. We’re all from the same sect, so it’s only right for us to help each other. Furthermore, before the battle of Kismet, the elders also instructed us to be United!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Wen zhinyi and the rest had a better impression of Lu Ming.</p><p>He was powerful, but he was not arrogant or overbearing. He gave off the feeling of a spring breeze. They knew that Lu Ming was someone they could befriend.</p><p>“Brother Wen, brother Gong, there are still many of our Talisman Amulet sect’s senior and junior brothers not far from here. Let’s meet up there!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Wen Zhongli and the rest nodded. Together with Lu Ming, they flew towards the gathering place of the talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming also understood why Wen Qinyi and the rest were being attacked.</p><p>It was obvious that the talisman sect had been targeted in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Not only the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, but even the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley would either kill or capture the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples and help them break some of the array formations in the ruins.</p><p>During this period of time, many talisman sect disciples had died.</p><p>Wen Zhongli and the other two had also bumped into Wang Chen, Nangong Bo and the rest. Without a word, Wang Chen and the rest had attacked Wen Zhongli and the rest. If it were not for Wen Zhongli and the rest desperately setting up a defensive formation in the valley while Nangong Bo and Wang Chen had the mentality of a cat and mouse game and wanted to play slowly, they would have been in danger before Lu Ming arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ji mai gritted their teeth.</p><p>The Emperor heaven divine Palace and the other two great powers really thought that the talisman Amulet sect was easy to bully.</p><p>The five of them chatted as they flew.</p><p>Suddenly, the five people’s eyes moved, and they all stopped.</p><p>The books of destiny appeared in front of the five of them.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Book of Destiny and saw a line of words appearing on it. One of the totem pillars had appeared in the nine forbidden grounds, and only by gathering all ten of them could one open the ancient city of Providence.</p><p>the totem pillar? could it be that the ultimate treasure to open the ancient city of Kismet is this so-called totem pillar? ”</p><p>Ji Mai’s voice was filled with shock.</p><p>The five of them put away the Book of Destiny and looked at each other.</p><p>It was obvious that the five of them had received the same information.</p><p>that should be the case. The totem pillars are the key to opening the ancient city of Providence. I didn’t expect one of them to be in one of the nine forbidden grounds, and one of them has already appeared. I wonder who has it!</p><p>Wen lezhang said.</p><p>Lu Ming knew about the nine forbidden grounds as well. Previously, he had learned from the three-eyed God that there were nine most dangerous places in this world. The nine forbidden grounds that the three-eyed God race called the forbidden grounds were precisely the nine forbidden grounds.</p><p>The nine forbidden grounds were many times more dangerous than the other ruins.</p><p>This world was very strange. There were some relics that were not very dangerous to Lu Ming and the others, but they were fatal to the three-eyed God race. Once the three-eyed God race set foot in them, they would be wiped out immediately.</p><p>These legacy sites seemed to be specially designed to test Lu Ming and the others who were participating in the battle of Providence.</p><p>This made Lu Ming feel even more that there seemed to be an inexplicable big hand behind his back that was controlling everything.</p><p>As for the nine forbidden grounds, they were the most dangerous of all dangers to the three-eyed God race.</p><p>Lu Ming had learned about it before but he did not think about going there. He guessed that the nine forbidden grounds were the most important places for testing. There must be amazing treasures in there, but they were often accompanied by danger. If one went there before he had the ability, he would be courting death.</p><p>But now, it seemed like he had no choice but to go.</p><p>Because even if he didn’t go, others would go.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
