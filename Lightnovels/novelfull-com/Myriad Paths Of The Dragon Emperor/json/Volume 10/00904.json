However, his arm was covered in a layer of purple flames. The terrifying flames were terrifyingly hot, as if they were going to burn Lu Ming’s arm to ashes.</p><p>Even with the protection of the scale armor, Lu Ming felt a piercing pain.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique circulated, and the four wills burst forth and condensed on his arm. A sizzling sound immediately came from his arm, and the flame was extinguished.</p><p>What a terrifying flame.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Wang Yan roared as the flames on his body grew even more terrifying. He seemed to have turned into a man of fire, and even his hair was covered in flames.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard as Lu Ming released two more bursts of dragon energy.</p><p>Wang Yan was very strong. His cultivation had already reached the great circle of the spirit ocean realm, and he was half a step into the spirit embryo realm. His intent had also reached level three.</p><p>At the same time, his bloodline was at the fifth level of the divine level, and the bloodline martial techniques he comprehended from his bloodline were also high-grade demigod martial techniques.</p><p>It could be said that he was not much weaker than Lu Ming in terms of intent and martial arts techniques.</p><p>His cultivation base had also increased by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming’s greatest advantage was his rich essential core and dragon power.</p><p>With three bursts of dragon energy, Lu Ming was extremely powerful and his strength seemed to be endless.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As he and Wang Yan clashed, a terrifying storm of energy swept out in all directions.</p><p>For a time, it was difficult to determine the winner of the battle between the two.</p><p>In the distance, di Feng was extremely shocked.</p><p>When Lu Ming was fighting him earlier, he clearly did not use his full strength. Yet, Lu Ming was actually able to fight Wang Yan.</p><p>Wang Yan was ranked 98th on the list of top 1000 talents. Although he was only a few ranks higher than di Feng, their strength was on a completely different level. Wang Yan was several times stronger than di Feng and could easily kill him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Wang Yan’s heart was filled with shock.</p><p>Each of Lu Ming’s punches seemed to contain infinite power, causing his body to tremble and his qi and blood to churn. If it was not for the fact that his flames were extremely terrifying, causing Lu Ming to be wary and need to use a portion of his power to resist his flames, he might not have been able to defeat him.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Above Wang Yan’s head, a ball of purple flame appeared. It was similar to Wang haoxian’s purple Heavenly Fire, but it was much more terrifying than Wang haoxian’s.</p><p>Five dazzling golden chakras flickered as Wang Yan used the bloodline fusion. The purple flames transformed into a purple flaming Divine Eagle that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded and the bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. Lu Ming’s body moved and merged with the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Suddenly, he turned into Nine Dragons. With a long roar, he pounced on the purple Divine Eagle.</p><p>With a roar, the devouring power burst out and enveloped the purple godly Eagle. The huge Dragon Claw grabbed at the purple godly Eagle.</p><p>The purple godly Eagle flapped its wings, and endless flames burst out. At the same time, it reached out its claws to grab the nine Dragons.</p><p>Instantly, a Dragon and an Eagle began a great battle in the sky.</p><p>In the distance, di Feng was shocked beyond words.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Di Feng roared.</p><p>Back in the battle of ninedragons, Lu Ming had activated the nine Dragon bloodline. At that time, the nine Dragon bloodline was still in the form of a five-clawed true dragon. Di Feng had seen it from afar.</p><p>At that time, he was extremely shocked because he had seen Lu Ming use the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had two divine level bloodlines.</p><p>Later on, he even saw with his own eyes that Lu Ming’s true dragon-form bloodline had self-destructed its chakra.</p><p>But now, not only had his bloodline, which had self-destructed his chakra, recovered, but it had also reached divine level level four and transformed into the legendary form of the nine Dragons. All of this had broken his understanding.</p><p>could it be that the Martial Emperor patriarch wants this kind of bloodline? ”</p><p>Di Feng’s heart jumped.</p><p>Lu Ming had once shouted in ninedragons that Martial Emperor Di Yi only wanted his bloodline. Could it be this kind of bloodline?</p><p>Di Feng’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>The battle between Lu Ming and Wang Yan was still difficult to determine.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming and Martial Emperor Di Yi were in the open, there was no need to hide the nine Dragon bloodline. He would use it when he needed to.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s really lively!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the distance. A young man with an ancient coffin on his back walked over.</p><p>They were the experts of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Corpse puppet!”</p><p>Di Feng’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The corpse puppet was ranked 96th on the list of top 1000 talents, two ranks higher than Wang Yan.</p><p>“Corpse puppet, you’ve come at the right time. Let’s work together and kill this person!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s voice came from the purple godly Hawk.</p><p>“Wang Yan, join forces with you? Why? Why should I join hands with you?”</p><p>The corpse puppet sneered and stood at the side, watching with its arms crossed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons and the godly Eagle clashed and retreated. They didn’t continue fighting and looked at the corpse puppet with fear.</p><p>The corpse puppet clearly wanted to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight, taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Lu Ming and Wang Yan transformed back into their human forms and stood in three directions with the corpse puppet.</p><p>“Hehe, why did you guys stop?”</p><p>The corpse puppet licked its lips, its eyes extremely cold.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the corpse puppet, his eyes frowning.</p><p>He could sense a dangerous aura from the corpse puppet. This person might be even more terrifying than Wang Yan.</p><p>He thought of demonic corpse, who was ranked 102nd on the list of top 1000 talents. They both carried an ancient coffin on their backs, and perhaps they practiced the same technique.</p><p>“Corpse puppet, do you want both of us to be injured and then be killed by you one by one?”</p><p>Wang Yan snorted coldly.</p><p>He was also extremely afraid of corpse puppets.</p><p>As such, the three parties were all wary and no one made a move.</p><p>“Corpse puppet, the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect have always had a grudge. Why don’t you and I join forces to kill Wang Yan? what do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>The corpse puppet’s eyes flickered, and when it looked at Wang Yan, its gaze became even colder. Clearly, it was moved.</p><p>Wang Yan was shocked. He could not even take down Lu Ming alone. If the corpse puppet was added, he would definitely be in danger.</p><p>corpse puppet, Martial Emperor Di Yi wants Lu Ming. If you work with him, I’m afraid he’ll think you’re accomplices.</p><p>Wang Yan hurriedly said.</p><p>The corpse puppet’s eyes immediately revealed a trace of fear.</p><p>Although the heavenly corpse sect and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were enemies, and the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse Emperor would naturally deal with Martial Emperor Di Yi, if he was really targeted by Martial Emperor Di Yi, even the corpse Emperor would not be able to protect him.</p><p>“Haha, why would I join hands with him? You must be joking!”</p><p>The corpse puppet laughed and said, ” how about this? the demon tree Canyon is just ahead. How about this? we’ll enter the canyon first. If there are treasures inside, we’ll fight for them with our own abilities. How about that? ”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>It was not a good idea to continue the stalemate. If one or two more top 100 talents on the list of top 1000 talents came, it might be disadvantageous to Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Wang Yan, it would not be too late to kill him later.</p><p>“I have no objections either!”</p><p>Wang Yan said.</p><p>After that, the three of them and di Feng returned to the canyon. However, the three of them kept a distance from each other, guarding against each other.</p><p>“What dangers are there in this Valley? Why don’t you guys go in?”</p><p>Wang Yan asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
