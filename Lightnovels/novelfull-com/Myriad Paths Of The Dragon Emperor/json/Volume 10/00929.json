Today, I’ll bury you here!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! a thunderous voice boomed from the three-eyed God race, causing one’s eardrums to buzz.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Some people were terrified.</p><p>There were simply too many three-eyed gods, and their experts were as numerous as the clouds. It was impossible for them to charge out. Could it be that they were going to die Here today?</p><p>Brother Litian, Blood Sword seven, Blood Sword nine, and the geniuses of the monster race all had ugly expressions.</p><p>“No way! Don’t tell me I’m going to die Here today?”</p><p>Vajra looked into the distance with fear in his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t resist!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Bai chixue and the rest.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The talisman sect disciples looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the mountain and river diagram flew towards the talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>“Remember, don’t resist!”</p><p>With that, the mountain and river diagram glowed and rolled up the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples, taking them into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“This … Is this a spatial treasure?”</p><p>King Kong’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming one after another, their eyes filled with greed.</p><p>“Kill!

They had no choice but to fight.</p><p>“Human brat, die!”</p><p>A burly three-eyed God with a battle axe in his hand and a Mount charged toward Lu Ming, swinging his axe down at his head.</p><p>This was a three-eyed God at the fifth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his fist was as heavy as a mountain, crushing down on the three-eyed God.</p><p>The three-eyed God’s body was punched through by Lu Ming and he died on the spot.</p><p>&Nbsp; the devouring power erupted, completely devouring the three-eyed God’s blood essence.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>When the other three-eyed God saw this, he pulled on his Mount and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of three people, and they were all at the sixth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>A long spear, a long spear, and an iron hammer-three types of weapons were thrown at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Boss, let me help you!”</p><p>The Vajra let out a long howl and charged towards a three-eyed God with a spear in his hand. His claw light slashed out and shattered the attack of the other party. The three-eyed God’s face changed drastically as a beam of light shot out from his third eye.</p><p>His Mount also roared and charged at King Kong with its sharp horns.</p><p>These three-eyed gods were not on the same level as the ones that Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>These three-eyed gods were even stronger, and they were clearly the elites of the three-eyed God race.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the same time, the other two three-eyed gods also began to charge at the Vajra.</p><p>die! Lu Ming took a step forward, and the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst forth, blasting toward the two three-eyed God race beings.</p><p>The two three-eyed gods, including their mounts, trembled and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with five rays of dragon energy and his strength increased greatly. In a flash, he charged at his opponent.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two consecutive palm strikes landed on two three-eyed gods, splitting them into pieces. Even their mounts were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other side, the spear-wielding three-eyed God had also been killed by the Vajra.</p><p>The commotion they were making had attracted the attention of the other three-eyed gods.</p><p>A few burly three-eyed gods glared at Lu Ming and King Kong coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>charge! he said coldly. The three-eyed gods commanded their mounts to charge at Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Then let’s kill to our hearts” content!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he transformed into the nine Dragons and charged toward the group of three-eyed gods with Vajra.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>devour! the nine Dragons roared, and a terrifying devouring power erupted. Some of the three-eyed God race beings at the first and second level of the spirit embryo realm were unable to control their bodies. They felt their blood essence and power being devoured by the nine Dragons.</p><p>They screamed in horror as they watched their life force slip away.</p><p>Even those three-eyed gods above the third level of spirit embryo realm were terrified. Enveloped by the devouring power, their breathing became unstable, and their blood essence seemed to be about to burst out of their bodies.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, they were greeted by Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>The terrifying power struck them, and all those below the fifth level spirit embryo realm exploded, their blood essence and energy devoured by the nine Dragons.</p><p>As for those at the fifth level of spirit embryo realm and above, they also vomited blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps combined with the devouring power was simply a large-scale killing weapon.</p><p>“Kill him! Let’s work together and kill him!”</p><p>A few of the sixth and seventh level spirit embryo realm three-eyed gods bellowed in rage and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Vajra! You enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>The mountain and river diagram danced and wrapped around the Vajra.</p><p>Vajra’s expression changed. He relaxed his body and mind. Suddenly, a force pulled Vajra and put him into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram immediately surrounded the bodies of the nine Dragons. Lu Ming completely ignored his defense and charged towards the three-eyed God.</p><p>The nine dragon claws kept striking out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two three-eyed gods of the sixth level spirit embryo realm were killed in a row.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>All around, the attacks of the three-eyed God race landed on the mountain and river diagram. The mountain and river diagram trembled slightly, but it was blocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and charged at a seventh tier spirit embryo realm three-eyed God. With a claw, he pierced through the heart of the three-eyed God.</p><p>The devouring power continued to erupt, devouring the three-eyed God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A black iron hammer heavily hit the mountain and river diagram, causing it to fluctuate.</p><p>The other three-eyed God at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm held a Metal Hammer and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Earth essence realm, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>This three-eyed God at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm cultivated the earth concept. Lu Ming had to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming pounced on the other party. The other party was frightened and retreated quickly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Human, go to hell!”</p><p>A long spear and a saber struck the mountain and river diagram heavily, causing it to fluctuate violently. Waves of energy passed through the mountain and river diagram and hit Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he offset this force.</p><p>it seems that the defense of the mountain and river diagram changes according to my cultivation. My current cultivation is still low, so the defensive ability of the mountain and river diagram is not very high. If the opponent is much stronger than me, I will not be able to resist it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
