Not bad!</p><p>Lu Ming took a quick glance and realized that both of them had reached the martial King realm.</p><p>On the side, many people were also sizing up Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou curiously. They did not expect that the two young men and women were actually Lu Ming’s disciples.</p><p>After that, the two siblings bowed to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. The two elders quickly helped the two of them up and were overjoyed.</p><p>Since he was Lu Ming’s disciple, they naturally treated him as their own child.</p><p>“Father, mother, let’s talk as we walk. We’ll also arrange a place for you to stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and a majestic true essence spread out. A cloud seemed to have appeared under Lu Yuntian and the others ‘feet, lifting them off the ground and flying forward.</p><p>There were thousands of people. They were all lifted up by Lu Ming’s essential core and flew in the air.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the rest were shocked. They knew that Lu Ming’s current realm had exceeded their imagination and had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>The group of people chatted as they flew, and their speed was not very fast.</p><p>As for Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other elders, they had already gone ahead to arrange accommodation for Lu Yuntian and the others as well as to make other preparations.</p><p>On the way, Lu Yuntian, Lin Xueyi, Hua Chi, and the others also learned that Lu Ming had won first place in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Although they did not know what the war of Providence was, they were still shocked when they heard that Lu Ming had suppressed the younger generation of the East barren and stood at the top of the younger generation.</p><p>Compared to the vast Eastern barren territory, the burning sun Empire was too small. It was like a grain of sand thrown into the sea.</p><p>They could not imagine how many geniuses there were in the entire East barren and what level they had reached. But now, Lu Ming had surpassed all of them and stood at the peak of all the proud sons of heaven. How could they not be shocked?</p><p>He was secretly pleased with himself. Lu Ming was someone who had come from the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>They did not ask Lu Ming why he brought them here. They knew that Lu Ming definitely did it for their own good.</p><p>There was no one who was reluctant to part with their Foundation, because all they could see here were magnificent rivers and mountains. Some places were unimaginably rich in heaven and earth ling qi. Compared to them, the burning sun Empire was like a garbage dump, a wild land. There was no way to compare.</p><p>And those experts, any one of them gave them a feeling of unfathomability.</p><p>A place like this was much, much better than the burning sun Empire.</p><p>This was normal. Mount Liangyi was a famous blessed land in the East barren. It spanned tens of millions of miles and had countless blessed lands. Some of the talisman puppet sect disciples didn’t care about it, but in the eyes of Lin Xueyi, Hua Chi, and the others, it was a priceless treasure.</p><p>Some people’s eyes were already shining. How fast would their progress be if they cultivated in such an environment?</p><p>Lu Ming brought everyone around. Not long after, an elder came and said that everyone’s accommodation had been arranged.</p><p>Lu Ming led the group and followed the elder.</p><p>The rest of the talisman sect members left one by one.</p><p>Only Bai chixue, fatty, and ruan Tingting were following him.</p><p>First, it was the residence of the mystical sword sect. It was a mountain range that stretched for thousands of miles. On top of it were seven huge mountain peaks that pierced the sky. It was extremely magnificent.</p><p>On it, spiritual Qi was faintly discernible, and spiritual medicine was everywhere. It was like a Fairyland.</p><p>Compared to the mountain Gate of the mystical sword sect, it was tens or even hundreds of times better.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the rest were overjoyed. They kept thanking the talisman sect’s elder. The elder knew that these were Lu Ming’s close friends and they had an extraordinary relationship. Naturally, he did not dare to thank them.</p><p>After that, Lin Xueyi brought the thousands of people from the mystical sword sect to stay.</p><p>Of course, there were more people in the mystical sword sect. Those who didn’t want to come were not brought along. Those with low cultivation and talent were dismissed. Those who were brought along were those with high cultivation and talent.</p><p>Master Lin, there are countless people on Mount Liangyi, but not all of them cultivate the Dao of inscription. Some of them are not suitable for the Dao of inscription, but those who are suitable for martial arts can be selected as disciples by the mystical sword sect in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>The yin and yang mountain stretched for thousands of miles. Not all of them were disciples of the talisman sect. There were also countless mortals living in some flat territories, and some of them had even established countries.</p><p>After all, it stretched for tens of millions of miles. It was simply too vast, as large as some small-scale regions.</p><p>After that, he bade farewell to Lin Xueyi and the others. He flew for hundreds of thousands of miles to arrange a place for Hua Chi and the other members of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>This place was not the slightest bit inferior to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>After that, it was the Lu family’s residence.</p><p>There were fewer people from the Lu family. They were arranged to stay on a huge mountain peak. The heaven and earth spiritual Qi on this peak was extremely rich. It was the best on the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>There were many palaces built on it, just enough for people to live in.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou and Zhuang Xiaoshan were temporarily staying with the Lu family.</p><p>After making all the arrangements, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and felt at ease. He then chatted with Lu Ming and Yun Tian about their experiences during this period of time.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming returned to the cloud Peak Residence and sat cross-legged in his room.</p><p>With luck on his side, he had yet to properly sense what benefits he had obtained!</p><p>He sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique. However, he stopped after a while.</p><p>This was because he felt that his body was completely normal. There was no change compared to before.</p><p>The only change was that he was more focused and his thinking was more flexible.</p><p>“Lu Ming, try to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth!”</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan was holding a spirit herb and gnawing on it, her mouth full of medicinal fragrance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he began to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>When Lu Ming calmed down, he immediately felt that his mind was extremely clear. The artistic conception of the heaven and earth around him was also extremely clear. It was as if his thoughts had become one with the entire heaven and earth.</p><p>this … The speed at which I can comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth is ten times faster than before!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>At this moment, he did not use the path-understanding ancient tree, but the speed at which he comprehended concepts was so terrifying that it shocked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you feel it? With fate in your body, it won’t change your body or your cultivation, but it will greatly increase your comprehension and become more compatible with the heavens and earth. In the future, whether it’s comprehending intent or anything higher, you’ll be like a fish in water!”</p><p>of course, it’s also faster to comprehend other martial arts techniques!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“It can actually change one’s perception? Then my power of comprehension has increased by ten times?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart beat faster and his eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>Everyone’s comprehension was fixed. It could be said that they were born with it. It was a kind of talent. He did not expect that Lu Ming’s current comprehension could be improved. This was too shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
