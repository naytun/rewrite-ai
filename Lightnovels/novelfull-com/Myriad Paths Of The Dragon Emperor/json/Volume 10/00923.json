He moved and rushed toward the passage. He planned to catch them off guard and rush through the passage in one go.</p><p>However, the puppets seemed to have known that he was going to attack. When Lu Ming moved, the puppets moved as well, and the sharp Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>On both sides of the passage, the other puppets ‘cold gazes were also directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest, your reaction is so fast!”</p><p>Since the surprise attack had failed, Lu Ming could only force his way in with his actual combat strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He dodged the first puppet’s Saber Light and flashed past its side, but what greeted him was even more Saber Light.</p><p>Lu Ming punched continuously, clashing with the few sabers that were slashing at him. The powerful force made Lu Ming’s body tremble, and the saber Light was also hit back by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and charged forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, the space was too narrow. He could not unleash the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He had just moved when the saber Light in front of him slashed toward him. It surrounded Lu Ming and sealed off all the space.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He could only wave his fists continuously and bombard the air.</p><p>Even with the aid of the formation, it was still very difficult to advance.</p><p>These were all puppets made of a strange metal. They were impenetrable and extremely hard. The most shocking thing was that they could use martial arts techniques. A puppet was more difficult to deal with than a human warrior of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward repeatedly, but he could only break through the encirclement of more than ten puppets. There were still eighty to ninety puppets ahead.</p><p>“I don’t believe that I can’t make it!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. With a Dragon’s Roar, the nine Dragons ‘bloodline appeared. Lu Ming performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a two-meter-long nine Dragon. Its nine dragon claws swiped in all directions, sweeping away the saber Light.</p><p>After transforming into the nine Dragons, his combat strength had increased again, and the speed of his charge had increased once again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying rumbles came from the tunnel and reverberated in the air.</p><p>After a full half an hour, Lu Ming successfully rushed through the passage.</p><p>As soon as they rushed through the passage, the puppets quieted down and stood on the two sides of the passage, motionless.</p><p>“I’m so tired!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat on the ground, panting heavily.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was completely depleted after he rushed through the passage. Fortunately, he gritted his teeth and charged through in one go. Otherwise, he would have vomited blood.</p><p>The difficulty was too high. How could an Ordinary Genius pass?</p><p>However, Lu Ming began to look forward to it.</p><p>The greater the difficulty, the greater the harvest. What kind of treasure would be inside?</p><p>The puppet had said earlier that there was a precious treasure inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Let’s first recover my true Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of raw gemstones and started to recover his essential core.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming’s essential core had recovered to its peak and he was filled with energy again.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He had only walked a few dozen meters when dense inscriptions appeared on the ground, forming a large array. It condensed into flaming dragons that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“There’s still a test. Is there an end to it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was so depressed that he was about to vomit blood. He could only clench his fists and bombard the air continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few consecutive explosions, Lu Ming retreated rapidly.</p><p>“This formation is so powerful. It’s even more powerful than the golems from before. How am I supposed to pass through it?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps back and a grave look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The flood Dragon formed by the formation was too powerful, exceeding the power of the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Furthermore, this was only the appearance of a single formation. There would definitely be more in front of him. This test was truly too difficult.</p><p>wait, I don’t have to force my way through the formation. I can break it with the Dao of inscription!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Formations were different from puppets. Puppets could not be controlled by others, but formations could be broken.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately looked at it carefully.</p><p>After a while, he waved his hands repeatedly. Runes appeared and entered the formation. With a bang, the formation collapsed. Lu Ming took a step forward, but another formation appeared in front of him. Lu Ming continued to carve runes to break it.</p><p>However, at this moment, under his feet, where he had just broken the formation, another formation appeared.</p><p>“Damn, didn’t we already crack it? Why is there a new one?”</p><p>Lu Ming was depressed. He could only continue to inscribe runes to speed up the cracking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The formation in front collapsed, but there were attacks coming from behind. Lu Ming had no choice but to use all his strength to resist the attacks and break the formation at the same time.</p><p>Just as he was breaking it, the formation that he had just broken appeared again.</p><p>Lu Ming really wanted to vomit blood. This array would be condensed again after it was cracked. What else could he do?</p><p>He had no choice but to grit his teeth and continue.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming blocked and cracked the attacks at the same time.</p><p>This process lasted for a full six hours.</p><p>Lu Ming was already half-dead from exhaustion. He had used up a lot of his essential core and even his mental energy fire was almost completely depleted.</p><p>this won’t do. There’s no end to this formation. I’ll break one, and another will appear. It’s impossible to break all of them. I’d better leave. I’ll be in danger once my true essence is exhausted!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Yi!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly realized that the array that he had just deciphered did not reappear.</p><p>could it be that the energy to activate the formation has been used up, and I can’t continue to form the formation? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up and he looked excited.</p><p>He continued to break the formation.</p><p>As expected, the next array that he had to crack would not appear.</p><p>Since it would not reappear, it was much easier for Lu Ming. Not long after, he had cracked all the arrays and stepped into a secret room.</p><p>no, I’m so tired. I’d better rest and recover first!</p><p>Lu Ming panted heavily. He sat cross-legged, took out the rough stone, and began to regulate his breathing.</p><p>A few hours later, he had fully recovered his true essence, but his mental energy fire was still very dim.</p><p>Just now, his mental fire had been severely depleted, and it was almost completely depleted.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the meditation and started to restore his mental energy fire.</p><p>In this world, not only was the spiritual Qi extremely rich, but the conception of heaven and earth was also very clear. Even sensing the nomological laws was much easier.</p><p>By circulating his mental cultivation method, he could easily absorb the power of inscription in the inscription laws and increase the strength of his mental fire.</p><p>After half a day, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire became vigorous again. He had completely recovered.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up and sized up the secret room. This time, there were no puppets or formations in the way. He seemed to have reached the end.</p><p>In the middle of the secret room, there was a picture scroll floating in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
