Bang!</p><p>With two loud explosions, the two refined corpses exploded. Lu Ming’s fists suddenly sped up, exploding with a terrifying pressure that locked Shi Ming in place.</p><p>Shi Ming’s eyes widened, and he let out a low growl,”No, no, how can he be so strong? I’m going to block it!”</p><p>The corpse Qi from his body soared to the sky. He exploded with all his strength and slapped at Lu Ming!</p><p>This palm was extremely terrifying, but in front of Lu Ming, it was like paper. It shattered with a loud bang, and the terrifying fist force directly penetrated his body.</p><p>At this moment, it was already too late even if he wanted to cry out and admit defeat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His body was torn into pieces.</p><p>The 99-foot flood Dragon was swallowed by Lu Ming’s Dragon of Providence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fate Dragon had grown by nearly 100 feet, reaching a height of nearly 960 feet.</p><p>He was only a few meters away from a thousand feet.</p><p>A terrifying devouring power erupted from his palm, devouring Luo Dao’s and Shi Ming’s blood essence and true Yuan.</p><p>Then, his figure flickered and he flew forward.</p><p>He looked around for Bai chixue.</p><p>On the grandstand, regardless of whether it was the people from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace or the heavenly corpse sect, all of them had very gloomy expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their expectations. He had easily killed the 30th genius on the list of top 1000 talents. How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so powerful?</p><p>It was a pity that they could only watch. The battlefield was isolated and they could not sense Lu Ming’s specific cultivation.</p><p>“This little bastard, could it be that Wang Yan and Wang Chen died at his hands?”</p><p>The master of the Wang family growled. His hatred for Lu Ming was wild!</p><p>However, Martial Emperor Di Yi was expressionless and calm. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>Du songjue, Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme Master, and the others all smiled.</p><p>as long as Lu Ming finds Chi Xue and finds a place to hide, he will be safe!</p><p>An elder of the talisman sect said.</p><p>that’s right. However, Lu Ming has so much luck now. Even if it is not seized by others, I’m afraid that no one in the eighth battlefield has more than him. By then, he will still have to participate in the battle between the last eight people!</p><p>The other person was a little worried and said with a heavy expression.</p><p>Thinking of this, the others ‘faces sank.</p><p>Without strength, it would be very difficult to preserve one’s luck in this selection step by step.</p><p>While Lu Ming was flying, Luo Tian was also flying at full speed.</p><p>A peerless genius of the sky demon Valley was also flying at full speed.</p><p>They had to find Lu Ming as soon as possible, kill him, and take his luck value.</p><p>They did not have much time. They only had one hour. If Lu Ming dodged them for an hour, they would not have a share of Lu Ming’s immense luck.</p><p>“Damn you, Lu Ming! Where are you?”</p><p>Luo Tian growled. Suddenly, he saw a few people in front of him and immediately rushed over.</p><p>“Not good, it’s Luo Tian, run!”</p><p>When the few of them saw Luo Tian, they fled frantically.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Luo Tian’s expression was ferocious. His demonic Qi surged and he slashed out with his black demonic blade. Two people were instantly killed by him.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The last person shouted crazily.</p><p>As the man shouted, a beam of light enveloped him. Luo Tian’s blade could not cut in.</p><p>The Dragon of fate above his head devoured the fate of the two people who had been killed. The person who had admitted defeat had 90% of his fate devoured. He was then teleported out and landed on the stands.</p><p>The fate Dragon above Luo Tian’s head had grown more than 200 feet.</p><p>that’s too little. I still have to find Lu Ming. That chick from the talisman Amulet sect is not bad either!</p><p>Luo Tian’s eyes were cold as he continued to fly.</p><p>At this moment, Bai chixue was struggling to defend. Around her, the shield kept shaking, as if it could not hold on for much longer.</p><p>haha, keep it up! This chick can’t hold on much longer!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth laughed.</p><p>Among the three of them, the Golden-robed young man was a new talent, but his strength was comparable to the top 100 talents on the list of top 1000 talents. It was already a miracle that Bai chixue could last for so long when the three of them joined forces.</p><p>“Lu Ming is almost there!”</p><p>In the stands, the eyes of du songjue and the others lit up.</p><p>They were outside, looking down from above and could see the whole picture.</p><p>At that moment, they saw Lu Ming rushing toward Bai chixue.</p><p>not good. Luo Tian is also rushing over there.</p><p>One of the elders shouted. Their faces turned extremely ugly, and they clenched their fists.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>In the Emperor heaven divine Palace, the Wang clan’s clan head, Jiang clan’s clan head, and the others laughed loudly.</p><p>“Lu Ming is destined to die at the hands of the geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan laughed the most heartily.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming traveled a hundred miles in an instant. He crossed countless deserts and stone walls under him.</p><p>On the way, they encountered other geniuses, but Lu Ming was too fast. He flashed past them. Those geniuses with low cultivation did not dare to block Lu Ming’s way at all when they saw his terrifying power. They fled one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in the mood to snatch the light from Providence from these people.</p><p>“Eh? There’s a battle ahead, that’s chi Xue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up when he saw Bai chixue being besieged by three young men.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>His speed became even faster, creating a terrifying Sonic Boom.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man and the other two heard the terrifying Sonic Boom and were shocked. They stopped and looked in the direction of the sonic boom.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The three of them were shocked and quickly retreated. The three of them stood side by side with a serious look in their eyes.</p><p>Although many people wanted to kill Lu Ming and take his luck value, they were all top-ranked geniuses.</p><p>As for the few of them, although their cultivation was not weak, they were not confident in facing Lu Ming.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence, Lu Ming’s combat strength was already very strong.</p><p>They were only on par with the top 100 talents on the list of top 1000 talents. They did not dare to look down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared above Bai chixue’s head.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew you would come!”</p><p>Bai chixue said with a smile.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed a smile.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden-robed young man and the other two were discussing in secret.</p><p>if the three of us join forces, we might be able to kill Lu Ming. Do you want to take a gamble? ”</p><p>The gold-robed youth sent mentally.</p><p>“Gamble? Fools, can’t you see that Lu Ming’s fate Dragon has grown more than a hundred feet longer? In just a short while, the fate Dragon has grown more than a hundred feet. There must be experts stronger than us who have died in Lu Ming’s hands!”</p><p>The Paragon from the heavenly corpse sect sneered as he slowly backed away.</p><p>Hearing this, the Golden-robed young man and the sky demon Valley’s sovereign’s faces changed.</p><p>Only then did they notice the changes in Lu Ming’s fate Dragon.</p><p>“You guys want to leave? Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the Golden-robed young man and the other two.</p><p>The expressions of the three changed drastically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want?”</p><p>The gold-robed youth gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Of course I want your luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and stepped forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
