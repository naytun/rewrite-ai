He did not want to die just like that. He felt a chill all over his body, especially when he thought of being killed by Lu Ming and possibly becoming a dish to go with his wine.</p><p>...</p><p>As for backbone, he had lived for so long that he didn’t know what backbone was. His top priority was to save his life.</p><p>Therefore, he only thought about it for a moment and nodded repeatedly. “Okay, I agree. You carve the formation, and you’ll be my big brother from now on!”</p><p>After saying that, his eyes revealed a pitiful look. However, he was big and burly, with a wide mouth and sharp fangs, and a fierce aura filled the air. How did he look pitiful at all?</p><p>“Relax your mind and don’t resist at all!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming began to inscribe the array.</p><p>The soul-splitting array. Lu Ming had once used this array to control Wang haoxian.</p><p>Soon, the formation was formed and entered the Golden Tiger’s head.</p><p>the soul splitting formation. With just a thought from me, your soul will be torn apart. At the very least, you’ll become an idiot. At the very worst, you’ll die on the spot. Do you want to try the effects? ”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the mountain and river diagram and looked at the Golden Tiger.</p><p>The fierce Golden Tiger’s eyes rolled and said, ” “No need, no need. You’re an expert from the talisman sect and are proficient in the Dao of inscription. I naturally believe you. Big brother, you’re my big brother from now on!”</p><p>The Golden Tiger transformed into a human form. It was a burly young man with strong muscles all over his body. His arms were thicker than Lu Ming’s thighs.</p><p>“Get lost, who’s your big brother?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Okay, okay, not big brother, but boss. You are my boss!”</p><p>The Golden Tiger immediately nodded and bowed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression looked better. He said,”What’s your name?”</p><p>“I’m called King Kong, what do you think? Isn’t this name powerful?”</p><p>King Kong’s muscles twitched as he spoke.</p><p>eh, it’s powerful. It’s indeed powerful. You’d better transform into your beast form and be my Mount for the time being!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Do … To be your Mount?”</p><p>Vajra’s eyes widened, revealing a fierce look.</p><p>Who was he? He was a heaven’s favorite of the demon clan who had fifty percent of the divine beast bloodline. He was high and mighty and worshipped by thousands of demons. Now, Lu Ming actually called him a Mount?</p><p>He was furious!</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to test the power of the God splitting formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at King Kong with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>King Kong immediately gave in and lost his momentum. He grinned and said, ” “No, why would I? It’s this little brother’s good fortune to be able to become your Mount, boss!”</p><p>As he spoke, he transformed into a ferocious Golden Tiger.</p><p>It was three meters tall and six meters long. Its body was covered in shiny golden hair, smooth and silky.</p><p>Needless to say, this fellow’s appearance was not bad.</p><p>Although King Kong appeared to be honest, he was cursing in his heart. I’ll bear with it, I’ll bear with it for now. When the battle of Providence is over, I’ll go out and think of a way to break that formation. I’ll definitely cut this kid into eight pieces to vent my heartache and hatred!</p><p>Thinking of this, King Kong’s eyes revealed a trace of viciousness.</p><p>“This guy looks honest on the surface. If I don’t teach him a lesson, he might stab me in the back!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He suddenly had an idea and exploded the power of soul-splitting.</p><p>Vajra let out a blood-curdling screech and started rolling on the ground.</p><p>“What’s going on? What was going on? Why do I suddenly feel like I’m going to split apart? it hurts, it hurts!”</p><p>King Kong kept roaring and rolling on the ground.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming finally stopped controlling the God splitting formation. King Kong lay on the ground powerlessly with his tongue out and a look of exhaustion on his face.</p><p>Aiya, I’m sorry. I accidentally triggered the soul splitting array that I engraved in your mind. Are you alright? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be surprised.</p><p>“O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o Big, was that you just now?”</p><p>King Kong looked at Lu Ming with great ‘hidden bitterness’.</p><p>I’m sorry, I was not careful just now. Speaking of which, was it because you were scolding me in your heart just now that I activated the soul splitting array? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at King Kong with a faint smile.</p><p>King Kong wailed in his heart. He finally knew the power of the soul splitting formation. This time, he was really honest and shouted, boss, boss, I’m innocent! From now on, I’ll be loyal to you!</p><p>“Yes, that’s more like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted the king Kong’s huge head. The king Kong’s combat strength was not bad. It would be of help to him if he kept it.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look at other places!”</p><p>He waved his hand and Lu Ming took the lead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>They hadn’t even taken a few steps when an invisible ripple suddenly came from the depths of the palace. At the same time, the entire group of palaces began to tremble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, the fluctuations became more and more intense, and the nearby palaces also trembled more and more violently.</p><p>“He’s inside, let’s go over!”</p><p>Lu Ming and King Kong went deep into the palace at top speed.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming saw a Palace in the distance emitting endless golden light. The vast mental energy formed a mental storm that swept in all directions.</p><p>An endless majestic aura filled the air.</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared from one of the palaces and sat cross-legged above it.</p><p>The endless golden light was being emitted from this figure.</p><p>“Chi Xue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to see the figure. It was Bai chixue.</p><p>that golden light is so terrifying. It’s a Golden Spirit Fire, the spirit Fire of an Imperial Dao expert!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>He had received Lian Cang’s inheritance, so he could tell at a glance that the spirit Fire on Bai chixue’s body was the spirit Fire of a ninth-level Alchemist, a sovereign warrior.</p><p>Bai chixue had received the inheritance of a level nine Alchemist.</p><p>While Lu Ming was shocked, he was also happy for Bai chixue.</p><p>He did not expect Bai chixue to have such a lucky chance to get the inheritance of a level nine inheritor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Golden light filled the air and the palace trembled. Inscriptions appeared on the countless palaces, but then they all collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>It seemed that Bai chixue’s inheritance had affected those formations.</p><p>“The disciples of the talisman sect can forget about obtaining the inheritance?”</p><p>With an angry roar, a blood-red sword light slashed towards Bai chixue.</p><p>Lu Ming turned pale with fright and leaped into the air. Previously, the palace was filled with inscription formations and it was difficult to soar into the air. Now that the formations had collapsed, it was no longer a problem.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was fast, it was too late.</p><p>However, when the blood-red sword light was about to hit Bai chixue, another sword light shot out from her body and blocked it.</p><p>“Seventh Blood Sword, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew into a rage. He stepped in the air and approached Bai chixue in an instant. His palm was like a heavenly blade, and he slashed at a young man in a blood-red robe.</p><p>It was the seventh Blood Sword, the sovereign of the heavenly corpse sect, who had just attacked.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The seventh sanguine sword’s eyes narrowed at the sight of Lu Ming. He brandished his sanguine sword, and the smell of blood assailed his nostrils. A sanguine sword light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blood-red light collapsed. Lu Ming’s body trembled as he felt his arm go numb.</p><p>The seventh Blood sword’s combat strength was even above the little demon Lord’s.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, figures flashed through the surrounding Palace. There were Talisman Amulet sect disciples and people from the other three factions.</p><p>“Talisman Amulet sect disciples, gather together!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
