One of his arms almost exploded and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>Luo Tian roared, and a Demon God appeared above his head.</p><p>This Demon God had three heads and six arms, and each of its arms was holding a huge saber.</p><p>Six golden chakras were shining.</p><p>Luo Tian’s third bloodline was a sixth-level divine bloodline, which was comparable to the family heads of the six great ancient families. His talent was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Two more streams of dragon power burst out from Lu Ming’s body. He appeared above Luo Tian’s head in an instant and stomped down on him.</p><p>A terrifying power surged towards Luo Tian.</p><p>Luo Tian was about to perform the blood Meridian fusion, but he did not expect Lu Ming to be so fast. He appeared above his head in an instant and exploded with a terrifying blow, interrupting his Blood Meridian fusion.</p><p>He could only block it with his saber.</p><p>But-</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The saber Light that he slashed out shattered under Lu Ming’s feet. A huge and terrifying force pressed down on him, almost crushing him to the ground.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>His bones cracked as if they were about to explode. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How could he be so strong? Do you want me to admit defeat? No, no, I can’t admit defeat. How can I admit defeat to Lu Ming!”</p><p>At that moment, many thoughts flashed through Luo Tian’s mind.</p><p>However, this thought decided his life’s fate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sharp and long nails emerged from Lu Ming’s claws. Like dragon claws, he suddenly clawed at Luo Tian.</p><p>All of Luo Tian’s attacks and defenses were shattered in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>His dragon-like claws pierced into Luo Tian’s chest.</p><p>“No, no! I’ll admit …”</p><p>At that moment, Luo Tian howled madly and wanted to admit defeat. However, Lu Ming’s energy exploded and Luo Tian’s heart exploded.</p><p>Luo Tian’s scream came to an abrupt end. He widened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief. He could feel the vitality in his body draining away rapidly. Endless fear enveloped him.</p><p>Was he going to die in Lu Ming’s hands? How did this happen?</p><p>In the next moment, his vision turned black and he lost consciousness. His life force had been extinguished.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the master of the Wang family roared.</p><p>“Luo Tian! Lu Ming killed Luo Tian!”</p><p>An old man beside the Wang clan’s clan master roared angrily, his killing intent soaring into the sky.</p><p>He was also a Supreme-being, the Supreme-being of Di Tian’s Imperial Guards. He was Luo Tian’s master.</p><p>He could not accept the fact that Luo Tian was dead.</p><p>Luo Tian had unparalleled talent, and his third bloodline was at the sixth level of the divine level. In the future, he would definitely be able to break through to the spiritual God Realm. There was even a very high possibility that he would be able to break through to the Supreme-level.</p><p>This was a future Supreme Being, but he had died just like that. This was an incomparably huge loss.</p><p>How many Supremes were there in the entire empyrean heaven divine Palace?</p><p>This generation had reached a Golden Age, where geniuses gathered and experts were as common as clouds.</p><p>In the past, Luo Tian’s talent would have been enough to suppress an era.</p><p>Just like those Supreme martial artists of today. When they were young, they were almost unrivaled. They pushed through their opponents and became Supreme martial artists.</p><p>It was rare for an era to have a few Supremes.</p><p>However, it was different in this era. Luo Tian could only rank tenth on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Haha, well done!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed out loud, drawing the gazes of those from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace that were filled with killing intent.</p><p>However, Yan kuangtu ignored him.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s face was still calm, and his eyes did not fluctuate at all. It was as if he did not care about the death of Luo Tian.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is interesting!”</p><p>A charming voice came from the sky demon Valley.</p><p>This voice was soft and sweet, making people feel numb all over. It was the voice of the demon Emperor.</p><p>When many young people heard this voice, they felt their bodies heat up and their hearts beat faster.</p><p>Even the woman was no exception. Her voice was like that of a Demon King, full of infinite charm.</p><p>“It’s a little interesting!”</p><p>The corpse Emperor opened his mouth. His voice was hoarse and ear-piercing. Many people wanted to vomit blood when they heard his voice, which was the complete opposite of the demon Emperor’s voice.</p><p>Some of the young people quickly circulated their martial arts to stabilize themselves.</p><p>On the battlefield, Lu Ming’s palm erupted with devouring power, devouring Luo Tian into a dried corpse.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Luo Tian’s blood essence and quintessential essence were both very strong.</p><p>Even his bloodline was being refined rapidly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The fate Dragon above Lu Ming’s head devoured Luo Tian’s fate Dragon. Instantly, Lu Ming’s fate Dragon grew by 200 feet, reaching 117 feet, close to 120 feet.</p><p>At that moment, the color of Lu Ming’s fate Dragon changed.</p><p>Originally, the fate Dragon was purple, but now, it had turned purple-gold.</p><p>Not far away, the Golden-robed young man and the paragons of the sky corpse sect and sky demon Valley were staring with their eyes wide open.</p><p>“Luo … Luo Tian is dead. Luo Tian was killed by Lu Ming. How did this happen?”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man muttered to himself, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Luo Tian, who was almost invincible in his eyes, was actually killed by Lu Ming. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>The gold-robed young man was almost scared to death. At the thought of joining forces to deal with Lu Ming just now, he was so scared that he was trembling all over.</p><p>Lu Ming could probably kill them easily and they would not even have the chance to fight back.</p><p>In the distance, the paragons of the sky demon Valley and the heavenly corpse sect were also scared out of their wits. They turned around and ran.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming glared at them coldly and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He took a step forward and his figure was like a stream of light, approaching the Golden-robed young man in an instant.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The gold-robed youth screamed.</p><p>Instantly, a pillar of light enveloped him.</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, the purple-gold fate Dragon devoured 90% of the Golden-robed young man’s fate Dragon. Then, the Golden-robed young man’s body trembled and he was teleported out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps did not stop. His speed was terrifyingly fast, and he would catch up with the paragons of the sky demon Valley and the heavenly corpse sect in a short while.</p><p>The two of them were horrified and also shouted that they admitted defeat.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming devoured 90% of their light from Providence and teleported them out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew you would come!”</p><p>Bai chixue came to Lu Ming’s side with a smile on her face.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll go seize the fate.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and turned to walk forward with Bai chixue by his side.</p><p>On the grandstand, the talisman Amulet sect members all revealed relaxed smiles.</p><p>In the eighth battlefield, even Luo Tian had been killed by Lu Ming. There was no one else who could threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>The most powerful demon clan genius was only on par with Luo Tian. There were a few other geniuses who could transform their fate into Dragons, but they were no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could be said to be fearless.</p><p>As for Bai chixue, with Lu Ming’s protection, she would definitely be able to hold on until the end and keep her 100000 points of luck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
