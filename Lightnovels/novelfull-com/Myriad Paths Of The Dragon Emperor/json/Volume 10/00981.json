You’ve abandoned the burning sun Empire and come to Mount Liangyi. Come, I’ll drink this as punishment!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the glass and drank it in one go.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t say that. The blazing sun Empire is so small. You won’t be able to achieve anything there. The spiritual energy in the heaven and earth at Mount Liangyi is more than a hundred times stronger than that of the blazing sun Empire. Moreover, the elites of the blazing sun Empire are all here. When your cultivation improves in the future, you’ll have countless blazing sun empires!”</p><p>Hua Chi laughed heartily.</p><p>in the world of martial Dao, everything is fake. Only cultivation and strength are real. I used to be busy with political affairs and neglected cultivation. From now on, I’ll work hard on cultivation.</p><p>Hua Chi raised his wine cup and drank it in one gulp.</p><p>Although the blazing sun Empire had been conquered by the ancestors of the Hua family, now that he had stepped out of the blazing sun Empire, his horizons had been broadened. He was very clear that the blazing sun Empire was just a small piece of land. Without power, any spiritual ocean tier warrior in the eastern barren territory could easily destroy the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>He understood that strength was King.</p><p>“Hua Chi, Shi TOU, there’s something inside that might be useful to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out two storage rings and handed them to Hua Chi and pang Shi.</p><p>There were some spiritual herbs, cultivation techniques, martial arts secret manuals, various materials for spiritual weapons, etc. They were not of much use to Lu Ming but it was good to leave them for Hua Chi and the others.</p><p>Hua Chi and pang Shi didn’t decline this time and accepted it.</p><p>They knew very well that Lu Ming’s current realm was too high, far higher than theirs. Many things that were of no use to Lu Ming were very useful to them.</p><p>Moreover, with their relationship, they would not be pretentious.</p><p>In fact, before this, Lu Ming had left some things behind in the mystical sword sect and the Lu family.</p><p>They were the spoils of war that he had obtained from the enemy during this period of time. To Lu Ming, they were indeed of no use.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s not talk about other things. Come, let’s have a drink!”</p><p>Hua Chi and pang Shi raised their wine glasses. The three of them clinked their glasses and drank the wine in one go.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you might not know this, but big rock is already married and he’s about to become a father,”</p><p>Hua Chi laughed heartily.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he smiled. big rock, you’re amazing. When did this happen? it’s a pity that I didn’t know about it. Otherwise, I’d have to go and congratulate you!</p><p>Pang Shi scratched his head, and a look of happiness appeared on his honest face. it happened last year. The child will be born in half a year!</p><p>As she said that, she blushed slightly.</p><p>“Haha, look at Shi TOU, his face is red!”</p><p>Hua Chi laughed.</p><p>“Don’t you know that Hua Chi has nine concubines? he has five children now!”</p><p>Pang Shi said.</p><p>“Nine concubines? You already have five children?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He looked impressed and said, love-struck fool, not bad. You’re so powerful. I’ll punish you. I’ll punish you. I’ll punish you with three glasses. No, I’ll punish you with nine glasses!</p><p>sigh, I had no choice. Those ministers are urging me to have an heir as soon as possible. I had no choice!</p><p>Hua Chi’s face was bitter as he drank a few cups of wine. Lu Ming and pang Shi laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what about you? We’re already ahead of you, so you have to work hard!”</p><p>Pang Shi looked at Lu Ming with a grin.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He picked up the glass and took a sip. A few figures appeared in his mind.</p><p>Qiu Yue had been taken away by an overseas expert, and no one knew where she was now.</p><p>I haven’t seen Mu Lan since I left Tianxuan region. I don’t know where she went.</p><p>Slowly, a figure appeared in her mind. Xie nianqing’s figure.</p><p>It had been a year and a half since Xie nianqing was brought back to the ancient Saint dynasty. How was he doing now?</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were running wild.</p><p>Shi TOU, you don’t have to worry about Lu Ming. He’s such a hero. How could he lack beauties by his side? didn’t you see that he has a few stunning beauties by his side? ”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a smile.</p><p>“Yes, yes, come, let’s drink!”</p><p>Pang Shi nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Lu Ming adjusted his mood and shouted at the two of them.</p><p>Lu Ming was very relaxed, relaxed, and open-minded when he was with Hua Chi and pang Shi.</p><p>The three of them had known each other since they were young. They had experienced the war in the burning sun Empire and had gone through life and death situations. Their friendship was pure, and there were no impurities in their relationship.</p><p>As the three of them drank, they talked about their cultivation in the mystical sword sect. Then, they talked about their experiences after that. The three of them drank for a few hours.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with warmth.</p><p>The path of cultivation was very lonely. Sometimes, one would need friends.</p><p>Perhaps there was a gap between their cultivation bases, and as time passed, this gap would grow bigger and bigger. However, once they sat together and held a cup of wine, there was no gap between them. There was only pure friendship between them.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, the three of them left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to Cloud Peak Residence. Instead, he headed to Yan kuangtu’s residence.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived, Yan kuangtu was in the middle of a discussion with the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is there anything you need us for?”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>A token appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was the mixed-essence token that he had obtained when he had won first place in the battle of Providence.</p><p>“Big brother Yan, senior Jiuyang, I want to ask you, what is the use of this mixed essence token?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Mixed essence token?”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master raised his eyebrows, and a hint of solemnity appeared on his face.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, on the other hand, seemed to be at a loss.</p><p>actually, I don’t know much. It’s said that in the battle of Providence, only those who pass a certain standard can get a mixed-essence token. In the past, someone in the East continent also got this kind of token!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Could it be that senior Jiuyang and big brother Yan didn’t obtain such a token?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>How talented were the nine suns Supreme and Yan kuangtu? They had all participated in the battle of karmic luck, so how could it be that they had never obtained such a token?</p><p>no, I didn’t get it, ” nine suns Supreme Master shook his head and said. madman didn’t get it either. As far as I know, some emperors didn’t even get it when they were young.</p><p>“I’ve read about it in an ancient book. Only a very, very small number of extremely talented prodigies have the chance to obtain it. It’s said that obtaining this token may be a great opportunity, but it may also be a great crisis. Lu Ming, did you get any news when you obtained the primordial chaos token?”</p><p>a-a sentence echoed in my head. It was ‘congratulations on passing the preliminary test’. There was no other information other than that!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>The eyes of the nine suns Supreme Master shone with a shocking light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve experienced the battle of Providence. You should be able to sense that there’s an unimaginable existence behind this battle of Providence, or an unimaginable force that’s controlling everything, right?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns asked.</p><p>“Yes, that’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>I feel the same way. Master, do you know what’s behind this? ”</p><p>Yan kuangtu asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
