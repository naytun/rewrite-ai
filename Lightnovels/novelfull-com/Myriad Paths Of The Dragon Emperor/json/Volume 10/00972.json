He felt his blood boiling.</p><p>that’s the mentality of blood! Blood Sword one has actually combined the mentality of blood and the mentality of sword into one!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. Xue Jianyi was indeed the second-ranked genius on the list of top 1000 talents. He was extremely powerful. Not only had he comprehended two powerful intents, but he had also fused them together.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could tell that Blood Sword one’s blood and sword concepts had both reached the fourth level. How terrifying was the fusion of two fourth-level concepts?</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The combination of the two essences triggered thousands of sword Qi, which completely covered the Emperor God and blocked his way out.</p><p>Golden sword Qi gushed out of the Emperor God’s body and he kept slashing. Every time he slashed, endless sword Qi would be destroyed, but more blood-red sword Qi would replace it.</p><p>For a moment, the Emperor God was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>it can’t be. The Emperor God is at a disadvantage. Is he going to be defeated? ”</p><p>Blood Sword one and two wills have reached level four, and he has successfully integrated them. He is indeed powerful, but the Emperor God should have more tricks up his sleeve!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>At that moment, the Emperor God frowned slightly. He had given up on blocking the sword Qi and let it Pierce his body.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were in their throats. They didn’t understand what the Emperor God meant.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>As the sword light pierced through, the Emperor God’s figure collapsed. It was just a Phantom. Then, everyone saw that the Emperor God’s body had already appeared dozens of meters away.</p><p>As soon as his figure appeared, sword Qi stabbed at him from all directions. However, he took a step forward as if he was taking a stroll in his courtyard. His figure suddenly disappeared and reappeared dozens of meters away the next moment.</p><p>Just like that, his figure continued to flash, and the endless sword Qi from all directions could do nothing to him.</p><p>transient step! This is the legendary transient step!</p><p>Someone shouted in shock.</p><p>“What? Instant step? How was it possible to use the instant step that was said to require one to comprehend the concept of space? Could it be that the Emperor God has comprehended the will of space?”</p><p>my God, it’s definitely the space mentality!</p><p>Exclamations of shock rang out, and those who made the noise were all from the older generation.</p><p>it’s actually the space concept!</p><p>Bai Shijing, Yan kuangtu, and the others also gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>There were thousands of types of intent realms in the world, and of course, there were also differences in their level. Among them, there were two extremely famous types of intent realms, which were the space-time intent realm.</p><p>Time and space.</p><p>With a myriad of intent realms, time and space were the Kings!</p><p>The time and space intents were the Kings of the ten million intents, so one could see how terrifying they were.</p><p>However, the Emperor God had actually comprehended the concept of space.</p><p>I can’t believe that the divine Emperor has comprehended the space mentality and successfully integrated it with the sword mentality. He’s indeed the number one on the list of top 1000 talents. However, his space mentality should only be at the complete stage of level three and hasn’t broken through to the fourth level. Otherwise, he’d be invincible!</p><p>Bai Shijin’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The Emperor God’s display of space will made Blood sword’s eyes extremely serious. He kept waving his sword fingers, launching a storm of attacks. However, the Emperor God’s body flashed, and the sword Qi around him could not do anything to him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the Emperor God slashed out a sword in the air.</p><p>This sword was only casually swung at the air, as if it was not aimed at Blood Sword one. However, Blood Sword one’s expression suddenly changed and he quickly retreated.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as Blood Sword one was retreating, a sword-light slashed at the spot where he had just been standing.</p><p>The Emperor God’s attack could penetrate the void and launch a terrible attack on Blood Sword.</p><p>It was strange and terrifying. If the Emperor God became an assassin, he would be the most terrifying assassin in the world.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Emperor God’s sword kept slashing out of the air. Then, sword light appeared around Blood Sword one and slashed at him.</p><p>Blood Sword rapidly retreated.</p><p>The Emperor God used transient step and chased after blood Sword. The distance between them was getting closer and closer.</p><p>it seems like the Emperor God’s attack has a distance limit!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he understood what was going on.</p><p>There should be a distance limit to the space will of the Emperor God. If the distance was too far, his sword Qi couldn’t pass through the space to attack others, which was normal. If there was no limit, he could take people’s heads from hundreds of millions of miles away, which was more than terrifying.</p><p>However, as Emperor God’s cultivation and space concept improved, the distance would become longer and longer. The further it went, the more terrifying it would be.</p><p>Time and space were Kings, this was not just a saying.</p><p>As the distance between the two drew closer, the Blood Sword was at a disadvantage and could be defeated at any time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Blood sword’s spine glowed, and a blood-red combat sword floated above his head. Seven golden chakras surrounded the combat sword.</p><p>This was Blood Sword one’s bloodline, a seventh level divine bloodline!</p><p>The Blood Sword merged with his bloodline and turned into a huge blood-red sword. The sword Qi shot up into the sky and slashed out. The space trembled and the sword Qi that the Emperor God attacked him with was all shattered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood-red sword slashed at the Emperor God.</p><p>“Defeat! Tiangang Emperor sword!”</p><p>The Emperor God strode forward and spat out a word coldly. He pointed his sword forward and slashed down.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, the space above Blood Sword Yi’s head seemed to shatter as boundless sword Qi slashed down towards Blood Sword Yi.</p><p>that’s a low-grade divine level martial technique, and it’s a low-grade divine level bloodline martial technique!</p><p>A Supreme martial artist cried out in shock.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked and their eyes widened.</p><p>The divine martial technique was a low-grade divine bloodline martial technique. The Emperor God had actually comprehended such a terrifying martial technique from his bloodline. He was not even in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Even among the fearsome powerhouses of the spiritual God Realm, there were many who had not comprehended God-level martial techniques.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Countless terrifying sword Qi fell on Blood Sword one’s sword. The blood-red combat sword trembled violently, but in just a dozen breaths, the huge combat sword seemed to be unable to withstand it.</p><p>The power of a divine level martial technique was too strong!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A roar came from the Blood Sword, and the blood-red sword Qi soared into the sky. The blood-red sword began to spin rapidly, like a drill, and rushed out of the area covered by the sword Qi. Then, with a flash of blood light, it turned back into Blood Sword one.</p><p>At this moment, Xue Jian Yi was in a sorry state. His breath was shallow, his face was pale, and there was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Blood Sword one sighed and admitted defeat to di Shen.</p><p>With Blood Sword one’s surrender, the Emperor God’s aura was withdrawn. At the same time, the fate Dragon above Blood Sword one’s head had devoured 90% of the fate Dragon.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings also sighed.</p><p>It wasn’t that Blood Sword Yi wasn’t strong enough, but that Emperor God was too strong.</p><p>However, after this battle, everyone finally saw part of the Emperor God’s strength.</p><p>With a cultivation at the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm, he had grasped the space and sword concepts. Furthermore, he had comprehended a low-grade divine bloodline martial technique. Such strength was truly astonishing.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, Yan kuangtu, Bai chixue, fatty and the others all looked very serious.</p><p>The Emperor God was too powerful. Could Lu Ming fight him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
