The shortest one was 10 feet long, and the longest one was 99 feet.</p><p>At this moment, the faces of Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were getting uglier and uglier.</p><p>This was because only a few of the 13 zongzis had come up.</p><p>The Wang clan master’s expression was similarly ugly.</p><p>He didn’t see Wang Chong and Wang Chen.</p><p>These people should have appeared in the group of people who had the fate of transforming into a flood Dragon.</p><p>It’s impossible for so many people to have their luck transform into a Dragon, right?</p><p>In history, there were very few people who could transform their fate into a Dragon, and they were all monsters among monsters.</p><p>“Chi Xue, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai Shijin’s heart was in his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai chixue did not show up.</p><p>“Lu Ming might be able to break through to the fate Dragon Transformation, but Chi Xue …”</p><p>Bai Shijin felt sad.</p><p>He understood that with Bai chixue’s cultivation, it was almost impossible for her to get such a high luck value, unless she had a heaven-defying opportunity.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>roar! suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar shook the surroundings and interrupted Bai Shijin’s thoughts. Bai Shijin hurriedly looked over and was immediately overjoyed.</p><p>Bai chixue, he saw Bai chixue.</p><p>At this moment, a real Dragon with five claws flew out from the top of Bai chixue’s head. It was about 30 meters long and was as big as all the other pythons and flood Dragons.</p><p>The fate had transformed into a Dragon!</p><p>Bai chixue’s luck had turned into a Dragon, which was completely out of Bai Shijin’s expectation.</p><p>The other patriarchs of the talisman sect were also overjoyed.</p><p>Obviously, Bai chixue had a great opportunity.</p><p>“Hmph, without cultivation, what’s the point of obtaining so much fate value? You’ll still have to spit it out later!”</p><p>Seeing that the two top-notch heaven’s favorites of the Wang family didn’t come out, the master of the Wang family was in a bad mood and sneered.</p><p>The faces of Bai Shijin and the others changed.</p><p>Well, there would be a fight later. Bai chixue had a lot of luck but not a strong cultivation, so he would definitely be targeted by many people.</p><p>Sure enough, all the heaven’s favorites around the fighting stage were staring at Bai chixue with hostility. When they found out that Bai chixue’s cultivation was indeed not high, their eyes became even more heated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, another Paragon stepped forward. A true dragon also appeared above his head, and his luck transformed into a Dragon.</p><p>“It’s Nangong Bo!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Haha, Bo ‘er is not bad!”</p><p>The head of the Nangong family revealed a smile.</p><p>Nangong Bo was ranked 32nd on the list of top 1000 talents, so the crowd was not too surprised.</p><p>Nangong Bo’s true dragon was about the same length as Bai chixue’s, about 100 feet long.</p><p>Following that, those who ascended the stairs were all existences whose luck had transformed into a Dragon. Moreover, most of them were ranked above Nangong Bo on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Of course, there were also special ones. There were also those who were ranked behind Nangong Bo, but there were very few.</p><p>There were even some who didn’t make it onto the list of top 1000 talents and were new talents.</p><p>For example, the corpse King of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>There were also the elites of the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Those who could transform their fate into a Dragon were all monstrous geniuses among monstrous geniuses and were extremely powerful.</p><p>People like Bai chixue, who had accumulated luck points through great opportunities, were rare.</p><p>“Ru Kong!”</p><p>Not long after, Bai Shijing, du songjue and the rest were overjoyed to see another Paragon of the talisman Amulet sect turn into a Dragon.</p><p>Ru Kong was second only to Huan Zhen in the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>The true dragon above his head was fifteen feet long.</p><p>10,000 was 10 feet, which meant ru Kong had obtained about 150000 luck points.</p><p>As for Wen Zhongli and the others, they had only been lucky enough to transform into a flood Dragon.</p><p>“It seems like Guan Tao, Liu Song and the others have all fallen!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others sighed.</p><p>Ru Kong had appeared. Now, there was also Huan Zhen and of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>However, could Lu Ming’s destiny really transform into a Dragon? He still hadn’t appeared.</p><p>Everyone was worried.</p><p>On the other hand, Yan kuangtu and nine suns Supreme were very calm.</p><p>As for the Three Sovereigns, they didn’t say a word and just watched quietly.</p><p>Especially the demon Emperor, who was covered in a layer of colorful light. Otherwise, with her seductiveness that could turn all living beings upside down, many young people would probably be possessed by the devil with just a glance.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another young man stepped onto the fighting ring with heavy steps.</p><p>“Demonic Lord Luo Tian!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Finally, the top 10 on the list of top 1000 talents had appeared.</p><p>The moment Luo Tian appeared, the Book of Destiny transformed into a true dragon that was 160 feet long.</p><p>Following that, a few more people entered the arena. They were all in the top 10 of the list of top 1000 talents. One of them was even a newly risen heaven’s favorite. It was shocking.</p><p>Each of them had fate Dragons that were above Luo Tian, and one of them even reached 200 feet long.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An extremely fat figure stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Most of the people in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace knew this fatty. He was the disciple of the demonic sky sovereign and was on very good terms with Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A 250-foot-long true dragon appeared above Fatty’s head, suppressing the true dragons of Luo Tian and the others.</p><p>This made many people extremely surprised. This fatty had actually accumulated so much fate value.</p><p>However, some people felt better after thinking that the fatty was the disciple of an Emperor.</p><p>How many people in the East continent could be accepted as a disciple by an Emperor? It was normal for him to be a little special.</p><p>After the fatty, the people who came up were all above 250 feet.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A young man with purple flames all over his body stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Wang fentian!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan’s eyes lit up when he saw the young man.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on the young man.</p><p>Wang fentian from the Wang family was ranked fifth on the list of top 1000 talents and the only one from the Wang family who was in the top 10. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>The true dragon above Wang fentian’s head was a full 300 feet long.</p><p>A refined young man immediately followed Wang fentian onto the fighting ring. Above his head was a true dragon that was 310 feet long.</p><p>He was three meters longer than Wang fentian.</p><p>“Dongfang Yu!”</p><p>A name appeared in everyone’s mind.</p><p>He was the peerless heaven’s favorite of the ancient Dongfang family, ranked third on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Then, a beautiful woman appeared. She was a demon race prodigy and her Dragon of fate was even longer than Dongfang Yu’s.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>More and more people entered, and some recognized them as the chosen of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blood-red sword Qi was released as a young man in a blood-red robe stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>The fate Dragon on his body had reached a shocking 400 feet.</p><p>Blood Sword one, the No. 1 disciple of the younger generation in the heavenly corpse sect, and the No. 2 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>even Xue Jianyi has appeared. I think only the Emperor God and ao tu of the heavenly demon Valley are left!</p><p>that’s right. Ao tu from the heavenly demon Valley is a rare heaven’s favorite among the flood Dragons. He can compete with the Emperor gods. I wonder who will get more luck this time!</p><p>I think it’s an Emperor God. Although ao tu is strong, he’s still a little weaker than an Emperor God!</p><p>“Look, someone’s coming up!”</p><p>The surrounding people discussed as they stared at the stairs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
