Their opponent was him.</p><p>...</p><p>Therefore, the two sides were in a stalemate.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you first, then deal with this little girl!”</p><p>The Paragon of the sky demon Valley burst out with a shocking killing intent. In a flash, he pounced on the Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect also shouted coldly, and the two of them began to fight.</p><p>Bai chixue was stunned for a second, then she seized the chance to quickly inscribe the formation.</p><p>She had already inscribed countless formations.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a golden spear light came from the other side, and its target was Bai chixue.</p><p>This was a heaven’s favorite of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and his eyes flashed with pride.</p><p>In his opinion, the two people of the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley were really stupid. They actually started fighting among themselves, which just happened to benefit him.</p><p>He wanted to kill Bai chixue and get 100000 points of luck from her.</p><p>“This is terrible!”</p><p>“There are other people!”</p><p>The paragons of the heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley cried out in alarm. They wanted to stop him, but it was too late.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>At this moment, Bai chixue shouted and took a few steps forward. A formation appeared and a huge ancient shield appeared in front of her.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spearlight struck the shield with a loud boom, but the shield did not break. It only trembled.</p><p>“What a tough shield!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man appeared, his eyes cold.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>All of a sudden, he thrust the spear in his hand 16 times in a row. 16 spear lights pierced through the void and went toward Bai chixue.</p><p>Bai chixue shouted and moved her fingers. Another formation of inscriptions appeared.</p><p>This time, more than a dozen formations glowed at the same time. More than a dozen ancient shields appeared, blocking Bai chixue’s attacks from all directions.</p><p>At the same time, there was also a light barrier that enveloped her.</p><p>From the very beginning, Bai chixue’s formations were all defensive formations. Her purpose was to defend.</p><p>As long as they could defend, they would wait for Lu Ming.</p><p>She believed that Lu Ming would definitely arrive in time.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>More than a dozen spearlights stabbed into the ancient shield, but the shield only shook for a moment and blocked all of them.</p><p>It couldn’t be broken!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s face darkened. He looked at the sky demon Valley and the heavenly corpse sect’s elites and said, ” everyone, this girl is quite capable. She has set up a defensive formation with all her might. It will not be easy for any of us to break through it. If we waste too much time, we will be found by others or Demon Lord Luo Tian. Then, we will not have a share.</p><p>“Oh? You want to join hands?”</p><p>The Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect said.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s work together to break this little girl’s defensive array. Then, we’ll see who has the ability to kill her or make her admit defeat!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do it this way. Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The sovereign of the sky demon Valley said.</p><p>The three sides reached an agreement and attacked at the same time. Suddenly, Bai chixue’s defense started to shake.</p><p>In the outside world, du songjue and the others revealed worried expressions.</p><p>Chi Xue’s defensive formation is quite mysterious. It should be related to the inheritance she received. However, she won’t be able to hold on for long with three heaven’s favorites working together!</p><p>“I hope that when she can’t hold on any longer, she’ll quickly admit defeat!”</p><p>A few elders were discussing.</p><p>“Not good, Lu Ming is going to meet an expert!”</p><p>One of the elders suddenly called out.</p><p>The others quickly looked in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at high speed and had already flown tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming from the side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he stopped abruptly, avoiding the saber Light.</p><p>A young man carrying a saber on his back appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, I didn’t expect my luck to be so good. You’re the first one I’ve met. Lu Ming, your luck points are mine!</p><p>The saber-carrying youth’s eyes were filled with excitement and ecstasy.</p><p>He really did not expect that he would be the first to meet Lu Ming.</p><p>There weren’t many top-tier experts in the eighth battlefield, but there were many experts of a lower tier.</p><p>Many of them were in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>He, Luo Dao, was ranked 48th on the list of top 1000 talents. In his opinion, he was more than enough to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing Lu Ming and obtaining his luck, he would then find a place to hide. After an hour, he would be able to obtain a huge amount of luck.</p><p>Luck!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>The Luo Dao was unsheathed. The dazzling saber radiance seemed to be able to split the world apart as it slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>On the grandstand, du songjue and the rest could not help but feel their hearts in their throats. Could Lu Ming block this knife?</p><p>Not only the talisman Amulet sect, but the experts from the Empyrean divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the heavenly demon Valley were also watching Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you little bastard. If you don’t admit defeat, you’ll be dead. Luo Dao is a rare genius among the Emperor heaven’s forbidden guards …”</p><p>The master of the Wang family sneered, but before he could speak, he froze.</p><p>That was because Luo Dao was already dead.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He thrust his spear forward. A spear ray that was ten times more dazzling than Luo Dao’s saber ray pierced through the void and destroyed his saber ray, piercing through Luo Dao’s throat.</p><p>Luo Dao’s eyes widened. His eyes were filled with confusion, shock, and unwillingness.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful that he could kill him with one shot?</p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with regret.</p><p>Did Lu Ming really rely on luck to obtain so many luck points?</p><p>That was the last thought in his mind.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Once Luo Dao died, the Dragon of destiny above Lu Ming’s head swallowed Luo Dao’s Dragon of destiny in one gulp. Lu Ming’s Dragon of destiny grew another six feet.</p><p>The crowd around the grandstand fell silent, and the patriarch of the Wang clan was extremely embarrassed.</p><p>Du songjue and the others revealed expressions of joy.</p><p>it seems like Lu Ming isn’t completely useless to be able to obtain an 800-foot fate Dragon. He does have some ability!</p><p>An old man from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace spoke.</p><p>Luo Dao is only ranked 48th on the list of top 1000 talents. There are many others who are stronger than him. He’s the target of public criticism. Even if he’s capable, he still has to die!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan said coldly.</p><p>On the battlefield, Lu Ming kept Luo Dao’s storage ring and was about to continue flying forward when he heard a Sonic Boom in front of him.</p><p>Another young man appeared and blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>This young man was covered in corpse Qi, and his eyes were fierce.</p><p>Shi Ming, the 30th on the list of top 1000 talents! Someone shouted.</p><p>haha, let’s see how Lu Ming dies this time.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family laughed.</p><p>Some people from the heavenly corpse sect also smiled.</p><p>If Shi Ming could obtain Lu Ming’s immense luck, it would be a great thing for the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“You killed Luo Dao? Hehe, looks like you have some combat power, but you’re dead for sure now that you’ve encountered me!”</p><p>Shi Ming sneered.</p><p>Above his head, a 99-foot long flood Dragon was circling.</p><p>He was just a little bit away from reaching the stage where his fate could transform into a Dragon.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He strode forward and threw a punch.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Ming Shi waved his hand and a refined corpse pounced at Lu Ming, throwing a punch as well.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The refined corpse and Lu Ming’s fist collided. What happened next shocked Shi Ming. His refined corpse was torn into pieces, but Lu Ming’s fist did not stop. Instead, it became even faster as it continued to bombard Shi Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
