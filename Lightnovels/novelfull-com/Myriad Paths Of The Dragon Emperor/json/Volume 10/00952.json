Otherwise, no one can stop the Emperor God and the others!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he smiled.</p><p>The other party was competing with the strong, which gave him a chance.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a shadow and rushed toward the capital.</p><p>Firstly, he came from the North, along the route that the three parties from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had taken.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were almost no obstructions along the way, and the three-eyed God race had all been drawn to the center.</p><p>On the way, he saw many corpses of three-eyed gods.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his nine Dragon bloodline and started devouring it crazily.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t be bothered to devour those of a lower level. He only devoured the corpses of three-eyed God race beings of the seventh level spirit embryo realm and above.</p><p>One by one, the corpses of the three-eyed God race turned into dried corpses.</p><p>Along the way, he had devoured over thirty seventh level spirit embryo realm, a dozen eighth level spirit embryo realm, five to six ninth level spirit embryo realm, and even a three-eyed God corpse with a perfected spirit embryo.</p><p>His blood essence and energy were extremely rich.</p><p>the two sides are still fighting anyway. Let’s find a place to refine it!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into a small room and entered the mountain and river diagram. He focused all his energy on refining the energy that he had devoured.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not long after, the nine Dragons let out a long roar. On top of the five golden chakra, there was one more chakra.</p><p>Divine level rank 6 bloodline. The nine Dragon bloodline had finally advanced by one level, reaching divine level rank 6.</p><p>With the advancement of the nine Dragon bloodline, the speed of refining energy had increased by several times.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Within his body, his true essence rumbled and was incomparably majestic. His spirit embryo was constantly being condensed and slowly shrinking. It was as if a powerful existence was being nurtured within the spirit embryo.</p><p>An hour later, all the energy in his body had been refined clean.</p><p>Peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Previously, his cultivation had been at the early stage of the seventh level spirit embryo realm. Now that he had reached the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm, Lu Ming was slightly surprised that he had not broken through to the eighth level spirit embryo realm after devouring so many powerful three-eyed gods.</p><p>On the other hand, his intent realm had some breakthroughs.</p><p>Outside the mountain and river diagram, there was still a constant roar.</p><p>It seemed that the battle was still going on.</p><p>it’s been more than an hour and they’re still fighting. It seems that the Emperor God and the others have met a strong opponent. I’ll go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming carefully left the room and rushed to the center of the capital.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, and he kept his aura hidden. He kept flashing in the dark, and almost no one noticed him.</p><p>In the center of the capital, there was a huge square. In the middle of the square, there was a stone pillar with various carvings on it. It was a totem pillar.</p><p>And around the square, there was an intense battle.</p><p>A vast aura filled the air.</p><p>Two of the three-eyed gods were extremely burly. They were more than ten meters tall, and the aura they emitted was almost at the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The Emperor God and two other powerful young men teamed up to fight against a three-eyed God.</p><p>A few powerful youths from the bloodblade continent also joined forces to fight against a flashing eyed God race.</p><p>Even further out, countless three-eyed gods were attacking the other chosen.</p><p>The totem pole was right in front of him, but he couldn’t seize it.</p><p>“This is my chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The bone armor on his body transformed into another form. He took a step forward and suddenly rushed forward.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>One of the three-eyed gods noticed him and swung his axe at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the three-eyed God was killed.</p><p>When the people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, heavenly corpse sect, and heavenly demon Valley saw Lu Ming, they thought that he was a genius on their side and naturally did not stop him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming killed a few three-eyed Celestials in a row and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. His body flashed rapidly like a ray of light. He passed through many battlefields and approached the battlefield where the Emperor God and the others were fighting.</p><p>He did not stop and continued to rush towards the central totem pole.</p><p>“Ants, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The three-eyed God who was fighting with di Shen and the others was extremely powerful. The third eye on his glabella shot out a beam of light that pierced through Lu Ming. Lu Ming was shocked and he dodged several times, retreating a hundred meters to avoid the attack.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Emperor God and the others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>They frowned. Lu Ming’s appearance was very unfamiliar and his aura was completely concealed. Which force did he belong to? He actually wanted to take the totem pole for himself?</p><p>you want to take the totem pillar? wishful thinking!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” scram! the tall and sturdy three-eyed God roared, but as he did so, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>There seemed to be an invisible energy pressing down on him.</p><p>in this world, the three-eyed God race can’t break through to the spirit God Realm. He forcefully broke through to the spirit God Realm and is being suppressed by the laws of the heaven and earth. He’s on the verge of death!</p><p>The Emperor God let out a long roar and fought with all his might.</p><p>These two three-eyed gods had forcefully entered the spiritual God Realm and were suppressed by the laws, so they couldn’t use their strength at all. Otherwise, no matter how talented the Emperor God and the others were, they wouldn’t be a match for a spiritual God expert. They wouldn’t even be able to block it.</p><p>The difference between a spirit embryo and a spirit God was too great. It was difficult to surpass because people in the spirit God Realm were overwhelming prodigies to begin with.</p><p>“I can only use the inscription scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and the inscription talisman that Huan Zhen had given him appeared in his hand. As soon as he opened it, his mental energy spread out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The inscription scroll glowed and Lu Ming’s body was suddenly covered in an array. Then, his body trembled and split into twelve Lu Mings.</p><p>There were a total of 13 Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, once he used this inscription talisman scroll, he would return to his original appearance.</p><p>However, the thirteen Lu Mings had the exact same appearance and body shape. Even their auras were the same.</p><p>this is a good opportunity! Charge!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With a single thought, the thirteen figures split up and dashed towards the totem pole at top speed.</p><p>The three-eyed God race was stunned, so was the God Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>The Emperor God shouted coldly. He had recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The three-eyed God bellowed in rage. A beam of light shot out from his glabella, aiming at one of the Lu Mings.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered non-stop as he dodged the beams. The three-eyed God’s eyes continued to shoot out beams of light, and finally, after much difficulty, they managed to hit him. That Lu Ming crumbled, but the other twelve continued to charge forward.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The Emperor God and the others also took action, not wanting Lu Ming to take the totem pole.</p><p>On the other side, the bloodblade continent and the three-eyed God who was fighting against them also moved to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>The people of the bloodblade continent did not want Lu Ming to obtain the totem pole.</p><p>However, they did not know which one was Lu Ming’s real body and could only attack randomly.</p><p>The remaining twelve Lu Mings ‘figures flickered continuously, avoiding the attacks and approaching the totem pole.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With so many experts blocking Lu Ming, it was naturally impossible for him to avoid all of them. He was hit continuously and his body collapsed one after another. However, in the end, there were still two bodies that managed to reach the totem pole.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, no!”</p><p>The young man from the bloodblade continent shouted madly.</p><p>The eyes of the divine Emperor and the others glowed.</p><p>They were not too excited. No matter what, Lu Ming was from the East barren. If he seized the totem pole, he could help the East barren to open the ancient city of Providence.</p><p>As for the fate value, he could just snatch it from the ancient city of Providence.</p><p>When they thought of this, they didn’t make a move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
