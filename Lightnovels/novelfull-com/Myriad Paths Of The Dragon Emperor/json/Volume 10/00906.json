He didn’t expect to encounter it here.</p><p>“I must get it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. The nature manifestation fruit was too important to him.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming soared into the sky and pounced toward the nature manifestation fruit.</p><p>At the same time, Wang Yan and the corpse puppet also soared into the sky.</p><p>“Get lost! The thousand elephant fruit is mine!”</p><p>Wang Yan roared. With his flames boiling, he threw two consecutive punches at Lu Ming and the corpse puppet.</p><p>The corpse puppet also launched two attacks at Lu Ming and Wang Yan.</p><p>They both wanted to stop each other and get the nature manifestation fruit for themselves.</p><p>“You’re the ones who should get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw two punches at Wang Yan and the corpse puppet.</p><p>The three of them retreated at the same time.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and two huge puppets appeared. They charged at Wang Yan and the corpse puppet.</p><p>The two puppets emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>The two puppets were both at Class 1 Lv 7.</p><p>Lu Ming had bought it from the talisman Amulet sect’s treasure Pavilion before the battle of Providence. It was meant to be used at a critical moment. With his current mental strength, he had more than enough to control a first grade seventh level puppet.</p><p>damn it, it’s a puppet! You’re an inscriber!</p><p>Wang Yan was shocked and furious. He launched a violent attack at the puppet. The corpse puppet was in a similar situation. Its palm was like a blade as it slashed at the puppet.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared on the big tree. With a wave of his hand, he put away the ten thousand elephant fruits.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. Corpse puppet, let’s join forces and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wang Yan let out a long howl, his killing intent surging like the tide.</p><p>“Alright, let’s join forces!”</p><p>The killing intent in the corpse puppet’s eyes was also extremely cold.</p><p>The nature manifestation fruit. Lu Ming actually wanted to keep the nature manifestation fruit for himself. How was that possible?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two puppets of the first class of the seventh rank were unable to hold Wang Yan and the corpse puppet back for long. Under the violent attacks of the two, their bodies were deformed and they lost their ability to fight. However, this was enough.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed out of the canyon.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to rush out.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>At this moment, a huge figure rushed in from outside the canyon. He let out a furious roar and a huge black fist was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The fist was the size of a water tank.</p><p>Before the fist arrived, the terrifying pressure brought about by the fist made it difficult for Lu Ming to breathe.</p><p>This was very sudden. Lu Ming wanted to avoid it but it was too late.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength in this punch, erupting the strongest power of the prison suppressing heaven art. He did not care about the huge consumption of his essential core because this punch put him in serious danger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with the huge jet-black fist. In an instant, Lu Ming felt an unimaginably huge force surging towards him. His body was sent flying backward like a cannonball, crashing heavily into the big tree.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The big tree exploded, and pieces of wood flew everywhere.</p><p>A burly figure appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>It was a giant ape that was ten meters tall. Its entire body was pitch-black, and it shone with a metallic luster.</p><p>This was a genius of the sky demon Valley. He had the bloodline of the ancient giant ape and was extremely powerful. He had definitely reached Level Seven.</p><p>It wasn’t even at the first grade of the seventh-level, but above it.</p><p>“Hand over the thousand elephant fruit!”</p><p>The giant ape roared in anger and charged at Lu Ming with its huge palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Pieces of wood flew everywhere as Lu Ming soared into the sky. At the same time, he waved his hand and a huge puppet appeared in front of the giant ape.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The giant ape’s palm smashed the first grade seventh level puppet into pieces. However, this block gave Lu Ming a chance to catch his breath. With the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, Lu Ming dashed out of the canyon.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Wang Yan and the corpse puppet attacked at the same time, blocking Lu Ming and unleashing their strongest attack.</p><p>The giant ape charged from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He made a sharp turn halfway and changed his direction, charging toward the five to six beasts.</p><p>The five or six beasts were chasing after di Feng and the others.</p><p>At this moment, di Feng was in a very miserable state. Those who had come in had already been killed by the five or six demonic beasts. Only di Feng and one or two other heaven’s pride experts were still running for their lives.</p><p>Di Feng was shocked when he saw Lu Ming charging at him. He instinctively slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw out a punch, easily destroying di Feng’s sword gleam and landing a punch on his chest.</p><p>Di Feng screamed as his body was sent flying. He was caught by one of the pursuing beasts and was torn in half.</p><p>The pitiful di Feng, the 101st on the list of top 1000 talents, had died in the claws of a beast.</p><p>After the beast tore di Feng apart, it went berserk and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure changed and he dodged the beasts ‘pounce. The giant ape caught up from behind and punched out with its huge fist, killing all the beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and his body flashed continuously. At the same time, he secretly released devouring power and devoured the blood essence energy of the corpses on the ground.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming led the giant ape in a circle around the plot of land before he dashed toward the entrance of the canyon.</p><p>However, at the entrance of the canyon, Wang Yan and the corpse puppet blocked it with cold expressions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the nature manifestation fruit and I’ll let you go. You’re taking it all for yourself. Don’t you think you’re too greedy?”</p><p>Wang Yan sneered.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s split the nature manifestation fruit evenly. If we join forces, we might be able to fight this giant ape!</p><p>The corpse puppet also spoke.</p><p>“You all have to die!”</p><p>The giant ape’s furious roar was extremely violent.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming charged straight at Wang Yan and the corpse puppet.</p><p>“Don’t even think about breaking out!”</p><p>Wang Yan and the corpse puppet joined forces and attacked.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a heavy step forward. The ground in the canyon was suddenly filled with multicolored light as formations emerged one after another.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was running just now, he did not run around randomly. With every step he took, he secretly laid an inscription on the ground.</p><p>The formation he had set up was naturally extraordinary. It was a level Seven formation.</p><p>Endless sword light rose and attacked the giant ape from all directions.</p><p>The giant ape waved its Iron Fist and scattered the sword Qi one by one. However, more sword Qi shot toward the giant ape and it was blocked.</p><p>“A formation? When did you set up the formation?”</p><p>Wang Yan and the corpse puppet were both extremely shocked.</p><p>They did not realize that Lu Ming had set up an array without them knowing.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He took a step forward and a formation appeared on the ground. A terrifying sword radiance enveloped Wang Yan and the corpse puppet.</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically. They could sense a terrifying aura from the sword-light, an aura that could kill them.</p><p>They had already made their move. It was too late to retreat now.</p><p>die! Wang Yan roared as his Extreme Purple Heavenly Fire bloodline appeared instantly. Just as the sword light was about to reach him, he transformed into flames. At this moment, the sword light descended and crushed the flames into pieces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
