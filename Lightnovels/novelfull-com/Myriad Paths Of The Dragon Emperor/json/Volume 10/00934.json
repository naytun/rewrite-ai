He swore that one day, he would return the favor tenfold. He would defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>For this reason, he cultivated with great effort. With the help of the Shangguan family, he made rapid progress. At that time, he also heard the news that Lu Ming had entered ninedragons and even beat up his mother.</p><p>At that time, he wanted to seek revenge on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, later on, there was news that Shangguan jinjue, the pride of the Shangguan family, had been killed. Later on, there were more and more news of Lu Ming fighting against other pride of the Shangguan family. It was obvious that Lu Ming’s combat strength had surpassed his.</p><p>This made him jealous and mad. It made him cultivate even more desperately. He wanted to awaken the divine bloodline and suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>However, before he could awaken his divine bloodline, Lu Ming had overpowered everyone at the social gathering and even defeated the Prince of the ancient dynasty in the central continent. Later on, it even directly triggered the war in ninedragons.</p><p>In that battle, not only was his grandfather, Shangguan Zhongyuan, killed, but even the Supreme-being of the Wang family was almost killed by Lu Ming. After that, Lu Ming even managed to escape from ninedragons.</p><p>After that battle, Lu Ming’s reputation had reached its peak.</p><p>However, the sacred constellation was not discouraged. He believed that Lu Ming had only relied on the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron in that battle. He did not know what method Lu Ming had used to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Even without the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he could still defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Later on, he had successfully awakened a third level divine bloodline, greatly increasing his confidence. During the battle of Providence, he had obtained a great opportunity, and his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds, reaching the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>He was even more confident and felt that he could easily crush Lu Ming.</p><p>However, everything that had happened just now, including Lu Ming’s two simple moves, had completely crushed his confidence.</p><p>It turned out that in front of Lu Ming, he was so small and vulnerable.</p><p>“No, no, I must kill him! I will!”</p><p>Saint constellation’s eyes were bloodshot. He immediately performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into a seven-star bloodline. He burst out with absolute power and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>If he did not kill Lu Ming, he would not be at ease. His heart of martial arts would collapse, and it would be difficult for him to make any progress in his martial arts cultivation.</p><p>The vast Starlight pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at it. He directly punched the Starlight.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Starlight trembled, and a scream came from within. Then, the Starlight collapsed and transformed back into the shape of the Holy star. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and fell to the ground like a pool of mud. He lay there in despair.</p><p>His aura was low and there was no fluctuation of true essence at all. Lu Ming’s punch just now had already destroyed his spirit embryo and crippled his cultivation.</p><p>“I’ve said that those three moves are your last chance to attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the sacred constellation and no longer looked at him.</p><p>On the side, the other young men retreated in shock.</p><p>They were also prodigies, but their battle prowess couldn’t compare to the sacred constellation, so they were naturally shocked.</p><p>“Wang Chen, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming shifted his gaze to Wang Chen.</p><p>hehe, you think you can fight me just because you defeated a piece of trash? what a joke. Fine, I’ll let you see how big the gap between you and me is!</p><p>Wang Chen laughed contemptuously as he slowly took a step forward. With every step he took, his aura grew stronger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The top grade purple Heavenly Fire on Wang Chen’s body shot up into the sky. It was as if half of the sky had been dyed with a layer of purple light.</p><p>The flames roared, and Wang Chen’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Fifth level spirit embryo realm?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint cold smile.</p><p>The fifth level of the spirit embryo realm was only one level higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Wang haoxian, watch how I cripple him. After I cripple him, I’ll cripple your cultivation and sell you off after the battle of Providence is over. I’ll let you know the consequences of betraying the Wang family!</p><p>Wang Chen’s voice spread far and wide, causing Wang haoxian’s face to turn pale.</p><p>“Wang Chong said something similar before, but he’s already dead. Now, I’ll send you down to accompany him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>“You killed Wang Chong? Hmph, then you deserve to die even more!”</p><p>Wang Chen’s killing intent soared. He took a step forward and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>With four intents revolving around him, he activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch as well.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fists collided and the air trembled. Wang Chen’s body swayed and he staggered backward. Lu Ming, on the other hand, did not retreat a single step.</p><p>The others widened their eyes and gasped in shock.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming could force Wang Chen to retreat with one punch?</p><p>Although the crowd was shocked when Lu Ming crushed the sacred constellation so easily, it was just a surprise. No one thought that Lu Ming could fight Wang Chen.</p><p>There was a huge difference between the Holy star and Wang Chen, and there was no way to compare.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes shone with a shocking light.</p><p>In the valley, Wen Qishi, Gong Fei, and Meng Jia’s eyes suddenly lit up, revealing a look of surprise.</p><p>Wang Chen, on the other hand, was furious.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Chen bellowed, his killing intent soaring. He had actually been forced back by Lu Ming. This was completely different from what he had expected. He had expected to beat Lu Ming half to death with a single punch.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must have used all your strength in that punch just now, right? But let me tell you, I only used half of my strength. Don’t think you can stop me!”</p><p>Wang Chen said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? Was it? I only used 20% of my strength just now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>nonsense, you’re talking big. Strength can’t be determined by words. Die!</p><p>Wang Chen’s aura grew even stronger as he punched out with his divine fist of flames, sending heaven and earth into chaos.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He was not wrong. He had only used 20% of his strength just now. However, obviously, no one believed him.</p><p>Then let the facts speak for themselves!</p><p>He stepped forward and threw another punch. This time, the power was even stronger. It collided with Wang Chen’s fist again, and Wang Chen was forced to retreat again.</p><p>This time, there was a look of disbelief in his eyes. His strength had increased, and Lu Ming’s strength had increased as well. He could not accept that Lu Ming could still crush him.</p><p>At the same time, he was a little shocked. Could it be that what Lu Ming said just now was true? did he really only use twenty percent of his strength?</p><p>Impossible, it was impossible!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A cold killing intent burst out from Wang Chen’s body. His bloodline emerged, and five golden chakras dazzled as he transformed into a ball of purple flames.</p><p>Divine level rank 5 bloodline.</p><p>In fact, most of the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents had fifth-grade divine level bloodlines, and only a few had reached sixth-grade divine level.</p><p>One should know that the six Supreme martial artists of the six great ancient families only had sixth level divine level bloodlines. How many Supreme martial artists were there in the entire East continent? They were all accumulated over the years.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flame turned into a sword and slashed down at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as Lu Ming burst out with two streams of dragon energy. His body swelled and scales appeared on his skin, making him look demonic.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He threw out a punch and it hit the flame sword heavily. The sword made a violent sound and kept shaking. Sparks flew in all directions and the sword was sent flying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
