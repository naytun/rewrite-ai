After ensuring that there was no danger, he reached out and grabbed the drawing.</p><p>“What kind of treasure is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up. It looked very ordinary. Then, he opened the painting scroll.</p><p>The first thing that came into view was a line of words: It was the mountain and river diagram, a treasure of the heavenly abode!</p><p>At the sight of this line of words, Lu Ming’s heart started to beat faster and his breathing became a little rushed.</p><p>A Grotto-heaven treasure, it was actually a legendary Grotto-heaven treasure?</p><p>Legend had it that an Eden treasure contained an alternate world.</p><p>In other words, there was a world within the Eden treasure. There were mountains, rivers, wind, rain, lightning, and Thunder. It was like a small world, and living beings could enter it to live and cultivate.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, there were only legends of Grotto-heaven treasures, but no one had ever seen one. Not even the Imperial Dao experts had one.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly opened the scroll.</p><p>The scroll was more than two meters long. A vast picture appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The vast mountain range and the mountain peaks that rose into the clouds were endless, as if a real world came into view.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had an idea and the Book of Destiny appeared before him.</p><p>A line of words appeared on the Book of Destiny: You’ve obtained the mountain and river diagram, a Grotto-heaven treasure. Your luck points have increased by 100000.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to beat rapidly again.</p><p>After obtaining the mountain and river diagram, his luck value had actually increased by 100000. It was simply terrifying.</p><p>In the past two months, Lu Ming had only obtained slightly more than ten thousand points of luck.</p><p>Then, another line of words appeared on the Book of Destiny: It could only be used after being condensed with blood.</p><p>He was probably talking about the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>With a thought, the Book of Destiny disappeared. Lu Ming studied the mountain and river diagram for a while, then forced a few drops of blood from his fingertips and dripped them on the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The blood landed on the mountain and river diagram and was immediately absorbed by it, disappearing.</p><p>Lu Ming then injected his essential core and began to refine the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>All precious treasures needed to be refined before they could be used.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was undoubtedly a treasure among treasures. It was extremely difficult to refine.</p><p>In the next half a month, Lu Ming was refining the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had to drip fresh blood every day and use his blood as a medium to carry out the refinement.</p><p>Half a month later, the mountain and river diagram was suspended above Lu Ming’s head, emitting a mysterious glow.</p><p>Slowly, the glow grew brighter and brighter. In the end, the mountain and river diagram shrank rapidly and flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was finally completely refined and it flew into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>With a thought, the mountain and river diagram reappeared in his hand.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait any longer.</p><p>With another thought, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly disappeared. In the secret chamber, only the mountain and river diagram was left floating.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body appeared on a mountain peak.</p><p>Standing on the mountain peak and looking into the distance, what came into view were vast mountains and ancient trees forming forests. The fragrance of flowers assailed the nose and waves of fragrance came from them.</p><p>“Is this the world inside the mountain and river diagram? It’s no different from the real world, and the spiritual Qi is also very dense!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the spirit Qi here was very rich. The mountain and river diagram seemed to be absorbing the spirit Qi from the outside world into the mountain and river diagram at all times.</p><p>“Let’s see how big the boundary of the mountain and river diagram is!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air, turned into a stream of light, and disappeared into the sky. Not long after, Lu Ming flew to the end. There was chaos in front of him. He had obviously reached the edge of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and flew to the edge of the mountain and river diagram. After that, he made a big circle in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“East to west, north to south, it’s about a hundred thousand li!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered with a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>This size was naturally incomparable to the vast divine wilderness continent. It was like a grain of sand, but Lu Ming was already extremely happy.</p><p>Because this world was something he carried with him.</p><p>Furthermore, it was not small either, slightly larger than the burning sun Empire.</p><p>There was also spiritual energy here, and one could also sense the essence realm of heaven and earth and the law of inscription. Such a treasure was simply a creation of heaven and earth.</p><p>In the past, the Supreme divine Hall of the nine suns Supreme also contained a space that people could enter. However, it was only so big and the area was very limited. There was no spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, nor could one feel the essence realm of heaven and earth or the law of inscription. Compared to the mountain and river diagram, it was many times worse.</p><p>Treasure, this was a peerless treasure. There were indeed great fortunes and opportunities in the Battle of Destiny.</p><p>No wonder so many geniuses were willing to risk their lives to participate in the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>however, other than plants, there are no other living creatures. There are no demonic beasts, ordinary wild beasts, or any spiritual herbs. I’ll have to replenish them slowly!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“Let’s pick some spirit herbs first!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He waved his hand and a large number of spiritual herbs appeared.</p><p>There were low-level ones and high-level ones. Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he planted the spiritual herbs on the nearby mountain peaks.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had planted thousands of spiritual herbs on the peaks and mountains. Of course, for a distance of a hundred thousand miles, a thousand spiritual herbs was like a drop in the ocean.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll take my time in the future. I’ve already spent enough time here. I’ll go somewhere else. I wonder how the other Talisman Amulet sect disciples are doing?”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram. The mountain and river diagram glowed and entered the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately walked out.</p><p>There were no obstacles when he went out and he passed through easily. After a while, Lu Ming came out of the place and arrived outside the palace.</p><p>He continued to walk through the small alley in the palace complex.</p><p>After that, they entered a few palaces, but they didn’t gain anything. The palaces were empty.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming found a few bottles of pills in what looked like a side hall of an alchemy room.</p><p>The congealing divine pill was a pill that could nurture one’s spirit and congeal the spirit Fire.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Previously, he had been forced to break through to a seventh-level Alchemist due to the circumstances. His mental energy fire’s Foundation was somewhat unstable and there were side effects. It would take a long time to recover. However, with the focus pill, he could recover in a short time without any side effects.</p><p>It seemed that this place was specially designed to test inscription Masters.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. Suddenly, he heard the sound of fighting ahead. There were people fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed forward in a hurry.</p><p>In front, two Talisman Amulet sect disciples were running away in a panic. Behind them, a youth with dense demonic Qi was chasing after them.</p><p>It was the little demonic Lord. He was chasing after two Talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>“You can’t escape. The people of the symbol puppet sect deserve to die!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord’s killing intent burst forth as he strode forward. A black blade light slashed at a Talisman Amulet sect disciple.</p><p>The two Talisman Amulet sect disciples took out their puppets and inscription scrolls to block, but it was useless. They were directly split apart by the little demon Lord’s blade.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The blade light slashed down, and a Talisman Amulet sect disciple was cut in half.</p><p>“Little demon Lord, Lu Ming zongzi will not let you off!”</p><p>The other Talisman Amulet sect disciple shouted. His face was filled with fear as he staggered backward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
