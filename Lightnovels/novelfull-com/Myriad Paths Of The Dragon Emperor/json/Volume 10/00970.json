What really made him famous in the eastern barren territory was the battle in ninedragons.</p><p>That battle had involved too many experts.</p><p>In the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent, the Supremes of the six great ancient families, Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme, and even Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming’s name shook the eastern barren territory.</p><p>However, the most famous one was that Lu Ming could control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that had never moved. As for Lu Ming’s own talent, it was neglected.</p><p>Many people felt that Lu Ming’s talent and combat strength were not particularly top-notch. He could not even be compared to the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had overturned everyone’s thoughts with his actions.</p><p>As it turned out, Lu Ming’s talent was unparalleled. He was no weaker than anyone else. As a Dark Horse, he had rushed into the top four and killed Luo Tian and Wang fentian. Now, he was going to fight with the three most powerful heaven’s favorites in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>although Lu Ming is talented, he’s too young and aggressive. He doesn’t know how to restrain himself. He has offended the master of the Wang family, Martial Emperor Di Yi, and even the Supreme of the heavenly demon Valley. Such a genius is destined to die!</p><p>“That’s right. In history, there have been many heaven’s favorites with unparalleled talent. However, not many of them made it to the end and became the Emperor. He was too sharp and didn’t know how to restrain himself, and in the end, he died a tragic death!”</p><p>that’s true. In my opinion, Lu Ming will end up like this in the end!</p><p>Many people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>At this moment, the vortex in the talisman Amulet sect flickered and a figure appeared.</p><p>Bai Shijin.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see Bai Shijin.</p><p>“Senior, how is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t worry, everything has been settled. They are now in Mount Liangyi!</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his thanks.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light fell on Lu Ming. He was about to fight.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and realized that another beam of light had landed on ao tu’s body.</p><p>This battle was between Lu Ming and ao tu.</p><p>Instantly, ao tu’s eyes shone with a brilliant light and a shocking battle intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Ao tu’s burly body crashed heavily into the fighting ring. His entire body was filled with a violent aura.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring, standing opposite ao tu.</p><p>Bai Shijin was extremely surprised. He didn’t know what had happened, but after understanding it, he was even more shocked.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to kill Wang fentian and fight against ao tu.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s such a waste of the nine Dragon bloodline in you. Why don’t you hand it over to me? I’ll definitely make it flourish!”</p><p>Ao tu licked his lips, and a greedy look appeared on his face.</p><p>okay, but Di Yi is also eyeing the nine Dragon bloodline. If I give it to you, aren’t you afraid that he will target you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Ao tu’s expression changed drastically, and his eyes flickered with uncertainty.</p><p>If that was the case, he would be targeted by Martial Emperor Di Yi after obtaining the bloodline of the nine Dragons. He would not be able to live in peace. Even the Supreme of the flood Dragon Tribe, or even the demon Emperor, might not be able to protect him.</p><p>His heart turned cold at this thought.</p><p>hehe, looks like you don’t dare to take it. You really don’t have the guts. Come, let’s fight!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit, and the essential core in his body was boiling.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Two Dragon roars rang out at the same time. One of them came from ao tu, who transformed into a flood Dragon.</p><p>The other Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. He had burst out with dragon energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered in a layer of purple-gold scales. He took a step forward and charged toward ao tu.</p><p>“Golden storm splitting slash!”</p><p>Ao tu opened his mouth and a dark golden ray of light burst out from it, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This ray of light was like a blade ray, but it was sharper and more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with the dark golden light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud explosion. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated a hundred meters before he could stabilize himself. On his arm, it was as if there were countless sharp forces cutting at his scales, causing sparks to fly in all directions.</p><p>“What a powerful metal attribute concept!”</p><p>He circulated his true essence and shook it, scattering the sharp force covering his arm.</p><p>Ao tu had more than 70% of the true dragon’s bloodline. He was born with the control of the metal element, and he could use it to a terrifying extent.</p><p>The light from the blade just now was the combination of the metal element concept and ao tu’s demonic power. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Golden storm splitting slash!”</p><p>Ao tu roared again. This time, nine beams of dark golden light shot out from his mouth, cutting through the air and slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming instantly released two more bursts of dragon energy. In total, he released three more bursts of dragon energy and his strength increased greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a human-shaped T-Rex as he charged towards ao tu. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and threw out a series of punches.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were nine consecutive explosions, and the nine dark golden rays of light were destroyed by Lu Ming. Lu Ming continued to rush toward ao tu.</p><p>“Golden gilded Dragon Claw!”</p><p>One of ao tu’s dragon claws had turned completely dark gold, as if it had been cast from dark gold.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He stretched out his dark golden Dragon Claw and swiped at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with the dark golden Dragon Claw, creating a terrifying boom. It was like two iron hammers had collided, forming a strong storm that swept in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he drifted backward for a hundred meters. He landed on the ground and took nine steps back.</p><p>what a terrifying power, what a terrifying attack. Is this a flood Dragon with over 70% purity? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Ao tu’s level should be at the middle stage of the eighth tier of the seventh level, which was equivalent to the middle stage of the eighth tier of the spirit embryo realm. His strength and attack power were extremely powerful and terrifying.</p><p>And this was only a flood Dragon with more than 70% purity. If it was a pure-blooded true dragon, how terrifying and powerful would it be?</p><p>Nowadays, there were very few pure-blooded divine beasts in the divine wilderness continent. It was said that there were quite a few in ancient times. How could such pure-blooded divine beasts, the pride of the human race, compete with them?</p><p>Now, the only known thing in the East continent was that the demon Emperor was a pure-blood.</p><p>I wonder if there are many pure-blooded divine beasts in the mysterious overseas continent?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not my match!”</p><p>Ao tu roared, interrupting Lu Ming’s jumbled thoughts.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The flood Dragon stomped its four claws on the ground and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. The nine Dragon bloodline emerged.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. At the same time, another dragon energy burst out from his body, making it four in total.</p><p>A vast Dragon’s might filled the air and surged toward ao tu.</p><p>Ao tu’s body trembled slightly, and a hint of fear actually appeared in his eyes.</p><p>That’s right, this was an instinct that came from ao tu. It was a fear he had for those in a higher position.</p><p>No matter if it was a demonic beast or a divine beast, the hierarchy was extremely strict. Bloodline was superior, and there were layers of suppression.</p><p>Ao tu only had the bloodline of the true dragon, but he was not a true dragon yet. However, the nine Dragons were existences that were even more powerful than the true dragon. They were one of the top ten war beasts, and the Dragon’s might that emanated from the nine Dragons made ao tu feel an instinctive fear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
