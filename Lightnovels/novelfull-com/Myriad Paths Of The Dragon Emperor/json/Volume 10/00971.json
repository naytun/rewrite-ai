Their nine claws stepped on the air as they pounced toward ao Sha.</p><p>Ao tu followed suit and roared. He overcame the fear in his heart and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The flood Dragon and the nine Dragons immediately fought each other on the fighting ring.</p><p>Ao tu had unleashed his metal element mentality to the extreme. His metal element mentality was definitely equivalent to the fourth level. His entire body was as hard as metal, and his dragon claws seemed to be made of dark gold. They were incomparably hard and could break anything.</p><p>Every move had terrifying power.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had four types of concepts surrounding him. When they were fused together, the power was equally terrifying.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming burst forth with four streams of dragon energy and circulated the prison suppressing heaven technique. Every inch of his muscles was able to burst forth with the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>Every muscle on his body was frighteningly powerful, and every claw had the power to suppress everything.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two dragons intertwined with each other and continuously attacked each other. It was extremely barbaric, and it made people feel as if they had returned to ancient times, where divine beasts fought for hegemony and true dragons fought in chaos.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The nine Dragons had nine claws, and ao tu found it difficult to block all of them. His body was grabbed by the claws of the nine Dragons, and they tore at him with all their might. Instantly, his scales were sent flying, and a large piece of his flesh was torn off, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>Ao tu retaliated with all his might in pain, tearing off a piece of the nine Dragons ‘bodies as well. However, his claws had almost been shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bodies of the nine Dragons seemed to be extremely heavy. They pressed down on ao tu, causing him to crash into the fighting ring, and the sound of bones breaking could be heard.</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves. Lu Ming’s courage grew as the battle progressed and he gradually gained the upper hand.</p><p>In the end, ao tu was still affected by the aura of the nine Dragons. He was somewhat afraid, and the more he fought, the more fearful he became.</p><p>He was already afraid. How could he be Lu Ming’s match?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as ao tu let out a blood-curdling screech. His body had been torn apart by the claws of the nine Dragons. He struggled with all his might, and in the end, he managed to escape. However, he left behind a large piece of flood dragon meat, which was drenched in blood.</p><p>flood dragon meat that contains 70% of a true Dragon’s concentration. Good stuff, leave it for barbeque!</p><p>The nine Dragons opened their mouths and Lu Ming’s voice was heard. Then, the piece of flood dragon meat disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming, that’s good stuff. Save a portion for me later!</p><p>On the grandstand, fatty shouted, almost drooling.</p><p>Ao tu’s lungs nearly exploded from anger.</p><p>He could not wait to swallow Lu Ming and the fatty.</p><p>fatty, that’s too little. These are mine, I’ll get more later!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pounced toward ao tu again.</p><p>“Ah, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Ao tu suddenly roared. He was extremely unwilling to accept this.</p><p>He knew that if he continued fighting, he would definitely lose and would most likely have to pay more flood dragon meat.</p><p>“You’re admitting defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He stopped and transformed back into his human form. He had a look of pity on his face as his eyes darted around ao tu’s body.</p><p>Ao tu had also transformed into his human form, and his expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>He wasn’t seriously injured, but his face looked worse than if he had been seriously injured.</p><p>This battle, he fought too sullenly.</p><p>The Dragon of fate above Lu Ming’s head devoured 90% of ao tu’s Dragon of fate. It expanded again, exceeding two thousand feet and approaching three thousand feet.</p><p>Such a huge fate Dragon was rarely seen since ancient times.</p><p>Lu Ming flew up to the grandstand.</p><p>“Fatty, it’s a pity that this guy admitted defeat early. You don’t have a share!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Damn it, no way, we’ll split that piece equally!”</p><p>The fat man shouted.</p><p>Ao tu, who was flying toward the grandstand, trembled and almost fell off the stage.</p><p>Ao tu flew back to the grandstand, and his expression was extremely grim.</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign’s complexion wasn’t any better than ao tu’s, and it was as black as charcoal.</p><p>Many people were shocked that Lu Ming had won the battle.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had entered the final battle.</p><p>The next battle was between di Shen and blood Sword. The winner would fight Lu Ming in the final battle.</p><p>Most of them thought that between God Emperor and blood Sword, God Emperor would win.</p><p>In that case, the final battle would be between Lu Ming and the Emperor God. That would be interesting.</p><p>The light flashed and enveloped the Emperor God and blood Sword.</p><p>The two of them flew onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Do you and I still need to fight?”</p><p>The Emperor God said coldly.</p><p>Many people’s hearts skipped a beat. From the emperor’s tone, could it be that he had fought with the Blood Sword before? However, he had never heard of such a rumor.</p><p>I was no match for him in the battle three years ago, but that might not be the case now!</p><p>Blood sword’s body was filled with a shocking amount of blood Qi, and his eyes were as red as blood diamonds.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Di Shen and Xue Jianyi had fought three years ago. It seemed that Xue Jianyi had lost.</p><p>“Three years ago, you were no match for me. From now on, you will never be my match!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s voice came out, showing great confidence.</p><p>“We’ll know after the battle!”</p><p>die! Blood Sword one shouted and stepped forward. A terrible sword power burst out from his body and filled the air.</p><p>This was the sword concept.</p><p>The Blood Sword took a step forward, and sword intent filled the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor God’s body also produced a sword cry. The next moment, a powerful sword power burst out.</p><p>It was also sword concept!</p><p>Di Shen and Xue Jianyi had both comprehended the sword mentality.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them were taking steps, and as they stepped forward, their sword intent soared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Their sword intents crossed dozens of miles and clashed in the air. The air between the two actually kept exploding with rumbles and sword hums, and sparks flew in all directions.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was grave. This kind of sword intent was too terrifying. The two hadn’t even made a move, but just the overflowing sword intent could easily kill a seventh level spirit embryo realm expert.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them took a step forward, and their bodies turned into a sword light. They cut through the void and slashed at each other.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two sword radiances clashed in the air, creating a loud boom. Sword Qi shot out in all directions, and the two sword radiances were forced back by the attack before clashing again.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Those with lower cultivation couldn’t even see the two figures. They could only see two sword lights clashing in the air.</p><p>A golden sword light and a blood-red sword light.</p><p>But at this moment, the golden sword radiance surged and struck the blood-red sword radiance away.</p><p>divine Emperor, peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. Blood Sword one, late stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could tell their cultivation level.</p><p>Moreover, both of their sword concepts had reached the fourth level. This was a collision of fourth-level sword concepts. However, it was obvious that the Emperor God’s cultivation was stronger. He managed to push back Blood Sword one.</p><p>The blood-red sword light flew back, and blood Sword one’s body appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the blood-red light on his body was getting brighter and brighter.</p><p>“Blood Sword, unsheathe!”</p><p>Blood Sword pinched his fingers and waved his hand. Suddenly, a blood-red combat sword flew out from his glabella. The combat sword grew to more than ten meters in size. Surprisingly, when the combat sword grew larger, it split into two, then four, and finally into sixteen huge blood-red combat swords, which flew around Blood Sword.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Blood Sword one shouted and waved his fingers. The 16 combat swords danced and turned into 16 sword lights, attacking the Emperor God.</p><p>The most terrifying thing was not the 16 combat swords, but the endless sword Qi that was stimulated as the combat swords flew.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
