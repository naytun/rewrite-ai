If the three of us join forces, we might be able to fight you!”</p><p>...</p><p>The Golden-robed youth called out.</p><p>“Oh, really? If you think you can fight me, then make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, a faint look of disdain on his face.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re very arrogant. Why are you so arrogant in front of a few good-for-nothings?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh came from afar. Then, a blade light cut through the void and came at an extreme speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The blade light disappeared, and a black-robed man appeared in the air.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the sky. It was demonic Lord Luo Tian.</p><p>Luo Tian is here. Haha, Lu Ming is done for this time!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man was stunned for a moment, and then he laughed.</p><p>He had wanted to run away, but now, he stopped. He sneered at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Now that the demon Lord has descended, let’s see how you die!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man was also a proud Son of Heaven among the Imperial Guards and was familiar with Luo Tian.</p><p>The two sovereigns of the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley slowly retreated to a place they thought was safe and watched from a distance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you kill my brother, Luo Li?”</p><p>Luo Tian looked at Lu Ming coldly and asked.</p><p>that’s right. He’s courting death, so I can only fulfill his wish. If you’re courting death, I can also fulfill your wish!</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>you’re so arrogant. It’s useless to rely on your mouth. If we weren’t on the sky Poison Island, I could have suppressed you with a flip of my hand!</p><p>Luo Tian said.</p><p>Back when they were on the sky Poison Island, Luo Tian was very clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength. Although Lu Ming was not weak, he was far inferior to him and could be easily killed by him.</p><p>Moreover, he had made some progress during this period of time.</p><p>“The luck of the two of you will be mine!”</p><p>Luo Tian looked at Lu Ming and Bai chixue with a burning gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai chixue’s combined luck was over a million. Once he got it, he would have a true dragon of luck that was more than a hundred feet long.</p><p>Since ancient times, how many people could have a true Dragon’s Luck that exceeded 1000 feet?</p><p>Only those emperors who participated in the battle of Providence when they were young could achieve this, right?</p><p>Luo Tian’s heart was burning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The demonic blade was unsheathed and the blade light broke through the sky. A terrifying blade light was slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This attack was very sudden. Luo Tian had just finished speaking when he suddenly attacked. He wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move and not give him a chance to admit defeat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth twitched and he struck out his palm at Luo Tian’s Saber Light.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm directly slashed at Luo Tian’s Saber Light. Was he that confident?</p><p>The talisman sect’s people couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p><p>Could Lu Ming block it?</p><p>This was a strike from demonic Lord Luo Tian, the tenth on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>How terrifying was that?</p><p>Many people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had ferocious looks on their faces. They seemed to have already seen the scene of Lu Ming being cut into two by the saber.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm finally collided with the saber Light.</p><p>Out of everyone’s expectations, Lu Ming’s palm slashed and the blade light shattered like fragile glass.</p><p>“You dare to launch a sneak attack with just this bit of power!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Luo Tian’s expression changed slightly. Although he had not used his full strength in the attack just now, he had wanted to kill Lu Ming with one attack. The power of the attack was not weak. It contained half of his strength.</p><p>It was actually shattered by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>it seems that you have made great progress during this period of time. However, you still have to die. I only used 50% of my strength in that strike just now!</p><p>Luo Tian said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? 50% of his power? I’m sorry, I only used 10% of my power in that palm strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly.</p><p>“10% of my power? Hahaha, you’re so full of yourself and lying through your teeth. Die!”</p><p>Demonic Qi surged from Luo Tian’s body. A violent aura burst out.</p><p>The terrifying saber power filled the entire area. Not far away, the Golden-robed young man’s face was filled with horror as he retreated.</p><p>“Is this the strength of the demonic Lord Luo Tian? It’s too scary!”</p><p>The gold-robed youth was shocked.</p><p>He felt that Luo Tian could kill him with a casual move. The difference in strength was too great.</p><p>The peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Luo Tian’s cultivation was at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>When he was on the sky Poison Island, Luo Tian’s cultivation should have just broken through to the seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The demonic blade was a thousand meters long and it slashed violently at Lu Ming. The space twisted and trembled violently under the blade, as if it was being cut open at will.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out. Lu Ming burst out with dragon energy, and dense scales appeared all over his body. He stomped his feet and his body shot forward like a cannonball, striking out with his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming was already at the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm, so he was extremely powerful. With the addition of dragon energy, the space was completely distorted when his palm struck.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic blade crushed and Lu Ming’s palm continued to push forward.</p><p>Luo Tian’s expression changed.</p><p>He had used almost 80% of his strength in this move, but he was still defeated by Lu Ming with one palm. How was this possible?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was right when he said that he had only used ten percent of his strength?</p><p>Impossible?</p><p>Luo Tian denied it in his heart. When they were on the sky Poison Island, Lu Ming was completely suppressed by him. He only managed to escape by taking advantage of the sky Poison island’s environment.</p><p>He refused to believe that Lu Ming’s combat strength had surpassed his in just a few months. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>“Blood transformation Devil’s blade!”</p><p>die! Luo Tian shouted as he slashed out with his demonic blade.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure did not stop at all. Surrounded by the four-colored concept, he charged forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Luo Tian’s blade-light was shattered by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>This was a completely one-sided battle.</p><p>Currently, three of Lu Ming’s concepts of heaven and earth were at the peak of level three upper tier. He was only one step away from completing level three.</p><p>As for the earth mentality, it was about to reach the peak of level three upper tier.</p><p>How terrifying was the power of the fusion of four intents?</p><p>It could probably compete with a fourth-level concept.</p><p>Luo Tian’s intent realm was only at the completion of level three and had not reached level four.</p><p>In terms of artistic conception, Lu Ming could crush Luo Tian.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After more than ten moves, Luo Tian’s Saber Light was continuously shattered, and he retreated quickly.</p><p>In the stands, many people widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The Masters of the Wang and Jiang families growled in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was actually so terrifying? How was this possible?</p><p>Du songjue, Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme Master, and the others were also surprised, but they were more delighted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had also exceeded their expectations. However, the stronger Lu Ming was, the happier they were.</p><p>haha, I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be in the top ten on the list of top 1000 talents. Brother ultimate sun, you have a good eye!</p><p>Du songjue stroked his beard and laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve exceeded my expectations too!”</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang also smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
