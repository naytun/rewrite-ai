There was even one in the third level of the spirit embryo realm, which was more than enough to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>The eight three-eyed God race beings were all tall and muscular, covered in scales. Their eyes were cold, like demons from the abyss.</p><p>They stepped in the air, causing the air to tremble. A terrifying aura emanated from their bodies.</p><p>All of the three-eyed gods who had been preparing to kill the chosen of the Luan clan suddenly stopped in their tracks and looked in Lu Ming’s direction. They wanted to see how Lu Ming was going to be killed, and how the chosen of the Luan clan would be struck with even more fear.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The eight three-eyed gods landed on the mountain peak. The mountain peak rumbled as the eight of them landed in four different directions, surrounding Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A second level spirit embryo realm three-eyed God shouted coldly, and a beam of light shot out from his third eye. This beam of light was made of ice, and wherever it passed, a white passage appeared in the space, filled with ice crystals.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; Lu Ming took a step forward, and a large formation appeared on the ground. Two ice spears were formed, one of which destroyed the three-eyed God’s beam of light, while the other pierced through the three-eyed God.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a formation!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the other seven three-eyed gods on the mountain all paled, and they tried to retreat, but it was too late.</p><p>&Nbsp; the cold air was pressing down on everyone, and twenty ice spears instantly appeared, surrounding the seven three-eyed gods.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The spear pierced through the air with unparalleled speed. The seven three-eyed gods screamed in pain as they were killed.</p><p>This was a level Seven middle grade array technique. It was more than enough to kill a three eyed God whose highest cultivation was only at the third level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>The other three-eyed gods all paled.</p><p>&Nbsp; the three-eyed God in the lead had a grave expression on his face, and then a cold killing intent began to spread.</p><p>“So you’ve set up a formation here. Do you think that setting up a formation is of any use? Let’s attack together and kill him with long-range attacks!”</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed God race ordered.</p><p>In an instant, all the three-eyed gods surrounded Lu Ming’s Mountain peak. They surrounded him from all directions, making it impossible for even a drop of water to pass through. On the other hand, no one bothered with the prodigies of the chaotic clan.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go further away!”</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, The Prodigy of the chaotic clan and the others flew far away, hiding on a hidden mountain peak to watch. If anything went wrong, they planned to escape immediately.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed God race gave the order, and all the other three-eyed gods ‘third eyes glowed. Beams of light shot out at the speed of light, shooting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Within three thousand meters, that’s enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Even though the three-eyed gods surrounded the mountain and didn’t approach it, they were still within 3000 meters of it.</p><p>This was enough!</p><p>He took a step forward and a huge formation appeared on the mountain peak. The formation was made up of countless inscriptions. It was the top-notch level-seven formation that Lu Ming had spent two days inscribing.</p><p>This formation was called the star chasing moon formation.</p><p>The formation was activated, and countless arrows were shot out in all directions.</p><p>Each arrow was like a stream of light, tearing through the void as if it could chase the stars and the moon. That was how the formation got its name.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The beams of light shot out from the three-eyed God’s eyes were all shattered, and the arrows didn’t stop. They continued to shoot out in all directions.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The power of a peak grade level Seven formation was truly terrifying. The three-eyed gods were all pierced through and shot into the air.</p><p>“Ah, ah, retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the remaining three-eyed gods all screamed in fear and tried to run, but they were greeted by even more arrows.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and agonized cries rang out. No matter if they were in the spiritual ocean tier or the spirit embryo realm, no matter if they were in the first level or the second level of the spirit embryo realm, or even stronger, they were all killed by the arrows in an instant.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>arghh! the leader of the three-eyed God race let loose a cry of terror as a vast aura erupted from his body. A terrifying black light that seemed to have the power to destroy the heavens and earth appeared.</p><p>This leader of the three-eyed God race had a cultivation of the seventh tier spirit embryo realm and was extremely powerful. However, under the attack of a peak grade level Seven formation, it was still useless. He was pierced through by the dense arrows and turned into a hornet’s nest.</p><p>A level Seven high-grade array could already kill experts of the seventh level spirit embryo realm and above, let alone a top-notch Level Seven array.</p><p>Lu Ming had spent two days to set this up.</p><p>In the distance, the Paragon of the chaotic clan and the others were all pale with fright, and their bodies trembled in fear.</p><p>They thought of how they had wanted to kill Lu Ming previously.</p><p>It was a good thing they were wary and didn’t attack. Otherwise, they would have been dead.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is too powerful. He can actually set up such a terrifying formation. We’d better not provoke him in the future. If others want to kill him and get rewards, let them do it!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the chaotic clan said with lingering fear in his heart.</p><p>that’s right. We can’t deal with such a monster. Let’s leave this place first and find other opportunities!</p><p>Another person said in a low voice.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s go! Leave this place!”</p><p>After that, the young man from the Luan family and the others left the place carefully.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, all of the three-eyed gods around the mountain had been killed by the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance in the direction where the youth from the chaotic family and the rest had left, but he ignored them.</p><p>He was just a clown, and the highest he could get was only at the great circle of the spiritual ocean realm. Even if he killed him, he wouldn’t get much.</p><p>With the appearance of the nine Dragon bloodline, a violent devouring power burst forth, devouring the blood essence, energy, and intent runes of the three-eyed gods.</p><p>“Let’s go and find a place to refine it!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and left the place. He found a hidden place and started to refine.</p><p>The surging energy was continuously converted into true essence and poured into the spirit sea.</p><p>The blood essence was used to improve the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>it’s enough, there’s enough energy. I’ll start to break through to the spirit embryo realm now!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and began to break through to the next realm.</p><p>The spiritual ocean tier was continuously expanding the area of the spiritual ocean. The larger the area of the spiritual ocean, the more Zhen Yuan it could store.</p><p>However, the spirit embryo realm was completely different. One had to condense the spirit ocean into a sphere, like an embryo.</p><p>This was the spirit embryo realm, and as one’s cultivation continued to rise, the area of the spirit embryo would become smaller and smaller, but it would become more and more solid, and finally give birth to a spirit God.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The spirit sea started to shake and change its shape. Lu Ming had started to break through to the next realm.</p><p>This process was slow and required time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. The spirit sea in Lu Ming’s dantian had disappeared and was replaced by a huge ball. This ball was transformed from the previous spirit sea and was completely condensed from vital essence. A vast and powerful aura was emitted from the ball.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body also exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Spirit embryo realm, breakthrough!</p><p>However, this was not the end. The energy from the hundreds of three-eyed gods he devoured was too abundant. Lu Ming’s energy had not been completely consumed even after he broke through to the first level of spirit embryo realm. His cultivation was still rising rapidly.</p><p>Another three days passed before Lu Ming’s aura stabilized. His cultivation had already advanced to the second level of the spirit embryo realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
