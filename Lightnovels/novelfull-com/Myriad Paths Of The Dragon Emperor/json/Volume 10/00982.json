Even the emperors don’t know anything about it, let alone me. Perhaps only the person who has the primordial chaos token knows a little!</p><p>...</p><p>the ancient book I once read was recorded by an ancient Emperor hundreds of thousands of years ago. At that time, there was already a battle of Providence. That Emperor also obtained a mixed-essence token when he was young.</p><p>according to his records, the battle of Providence seems to be a selection of geniuses. It’s only the beginning. If you meet certain standards and obtain a mixed-essence token, you can take the next test, but it’s very dangerous. According to the records of that Emperor, he’s seen countless geniuses who were more talented than him die. He was only lucky to survive and obtain some opportunities!</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang stopped here.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yan kuangtu were extremely shocked.</p><p>The emperors from hundreds of thousands of years ago … Had the battle of karmic luck been going on for so long?</p><p>One had to know that an Emperor could only live for ten to twenty thousand years at most.</p><p>What kind of existence or power would take such a long time to select a heaven’s favorite?</p><p>Also, that Emperor had seen countless geniuses who were more talented than him die. What kind of geniuses were those?</p><p>To become an Emperor, which one of them didn’t have unparalleled talent? which one of them wasn’t unparalleled?</p><p>A divine Emperor was talented enough, but he only had the potential to reach the Emperor realm. He wasn’t 100% sure that he could.</p><p>The Supreme Master of the nine suns, Yan kuangtu, which one of them wasn’t an unparalleled talent? they also didn’t have the confidence to break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>However, the ancient Emperor said that he had seen countless heaven’s favorites who were stronger than him die. Even he had survived by luck.</p><p>Could it be that the person with the token would have a new test later on?</p><p>“Master, what else did the ancient Emperor say? Did he say what kind of existence is behind it?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu asked curiously.</p><p>there’s nothing else. There’s no more records. That ancient Emperor didn’t have the right to know what happened below. He wasn’t qualified enough! nine suns Supreme Master shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yan kuangtu were extremely shocked.</p><p>The things hidden behind the battle of Providence were beyond their imagination.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the fact that you’re able to obtain the primordial chaos token means that you’ve been acknowledged. Perhaps there will be greater opportunities in the future. Keep it for now and don’t think too much about it!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Is Supreme martial artist Yan here?”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from outside.</p><p>He was here to find Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Yes, please come in!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu waved his hand, and the gate of the courtyard opened. A middle-aged man walked in.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized him as an elder of the talisman sect.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes swept over the crowd and he quickly saluted,”Fan Xing pays his respects to zongzi, senior Jiuyang, and Supreme martial artist Yan!”</p><p>“Elder Fang, what is the matter?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu asked.</p><p>I’m here on the orders of the two sect Masters and the doyens to invite Supreme Yan and senior Jiuyang. I was going to invite zongzi and the doyens to the meeting hall to discuss something!</p><p>Fan Xing said.</p><p>“Oh? There must be something important for the elders of both factions to be gathered here. We’ll head over now.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, nine suns Supreme, and fan Xing went to the discussion hall. When they arrived, fan Xing left, as he was not qualified to participate.</p><p>everyone, the great army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is here to attack. Martial Emperor Di Yi will lead the Army personally!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest arrived, Bai Shijin sent a message.</p><p>Di Yi really can’t hold back. He’s going to make a move, ” nine suns Supreme said, his eyes focused.</p><p>“Seniors, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>we’ve already discussed it. Mount Liangyi is a natural formation. With the blessing of the patriarchs of the talisman Amulet sect, we don’t have to worry about its defense. Even Di Yi can’t break in.</p><p>therefore, we have decided to give up all the territories of the talisman Amulet sect. We will withdraw all the disciples and experts of the talisman Amulet sect to the yin and yang mountain and use the great formation to resist the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank and he sighed in his heart.</p><p>With the talisman Amulet sect’s current strength, they were simply unable to fight against the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Even if Di Yi did not move, they were no match for the forces below, let alone Di Yi and Martial Emperor.</p><p>The best way now was to use the formation of Mount Liangyi to defend and slowly accumulate strength for a counterattack.</p><p>After discussing the specific steps, they sent out orders one by one, asking the experts in the territory of the talisman Amulet sect to retreat to the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, I have an item that should be of some help to you.”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said while everyone was discussing.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the nine suns asked doubtfully.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a Jade-like figure appeared in the hall.</p><p>“This … Could this be the legendary heaven and earth Jade essence?”</p><p>When Bai Shijin, du songjue and the others saw this, their eyes almost popped out. They were tongue-tied.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the heaven and earth Jade essence. I obtained it in the battle of fate. Senior nine yang, with this, I wonder if you can form a physical body!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At this moment, Supreme Master Jiuyang’s eyes shone with a shocking light, as if they were two suns.</p><p>my soul is already very solid now. If I add a few more materials and this heaven and earth Jade essence, I can completely condense a physical body and return to my peak!</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang said after taking a deep breath.</p><p>His voice trembled a little, showing how excited he was.</p><p>“Really? Hahaha, that’s great!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was overjoyed and laughed in excitement.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were also overjoyed.</p><p>What kind of person was the Supreme Master of the nine suns? He was known as the number one Supreme Being in the East barren. If Supreme Master Jiuyang could form a new body, the talisman Amulet sect’s strength would undoubtedly increase greatly. They would have another Supreme Being. How could they not be excited?</p><p>It would be extremely important if the nine suns Supreme could reform his body during this war.</p><p>that’s good. I still have a bottle of life potion here. It might be useful!</p><p>Lu Ming took out another bottle of life potion, shocking Bai Shijin and the rest.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming had indeed obtained a great opportunity in the battle of Providence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme did not stand on ceremony. He stared into Lu Ming’s eyes and said solemnly.</p><p>senior Jiuyang, there’s no need to be so polite with me. Without you, I wouldn’t be where I am today. As long as I can help senior Jiuyang, this is nothing!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to thank you too. From now on, you’re my best brother.”</p><p>Yan kuangtu patted Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“Wasn’t it in the past?” Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ve always been, hahaha!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>With the heaven Earth Jade essence and the elixir of life, the rest of the materials were easy to obtain. The talisman sect managed to gather the required materials in no time, and the nine suns Paragon also went into seclusion to reforge his physical body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
