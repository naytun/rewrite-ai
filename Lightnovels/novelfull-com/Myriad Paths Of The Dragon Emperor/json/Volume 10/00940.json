A great opportunity!</p><p>Jin Gang grinned.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them also smiled.</p><p>“Let’s split it equally?”</p><p>Wen lezhang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest agreed.</p><p>Wen zhishi took out the Jade bottle and prepared to collect the elixir of life.</p><p>hahaha, what a great opportunity! There’s actually an elixir of life here!</p><p>At this moment, an excited laugh was heard. With a flash of golden light, a young man appeared on the scene.</p><p>“The Golden pool!”</p><p>The few of them were shocked.</p><p>The newcomer was none other than Jin Chi, the Supreme talent of the demon clan from the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>Jinchi’s gaze swept across the elixir of life and he berated, ” “I’m in a good mood today, so I won’t kill you. You can get lost now!”</p><p>golden pool, we were the ones who discovered this elixir of life first. If you want to keep it for yourself, aren’t you being too greedy? ”</p><p>Wen zhishi said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Big appetite? My appetite is just that big. Why? Do you still want to fight me?”</p><p>A golden light emanated from Jinchi’s body. His eyes were filled with killing intent and he looked at Lu Ming and the others with disdain.</p><p>King Kong, you’re a heaven’s favorite of the demon race. It’s embarrassing for you to hang out with the human race. You don’t have to go back to the sky demon Valley. Otherwise, I don’t mind killing you!</p><p>A cold voice came out of Jinchi’s mouth.</p><p>King Kong’s expression was ugly, but he didn’t dare to refute. Fear flashed in his eyes.</p><p>It was obvious that Vajra was extremely afraid of the Golden pool.</p><p>The spiritual fire between Wen zhishi’s and Gong Fei’s brows leaped. Vital essence burst forth from Lu Ming’s body as he confronted the Golden pool.</p><p>“Overestimating your own ability, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Jinchi’s eyes turned cold. The golden light on his body became even more intense, and a terrifying aura burst out.</p><p>That aura was incomparably vast, and the pressure was like a mountain pressing down on everyone. Lu Ming and the others felt an extremely dangerous feeling in their hearts.</p><p>He felt that as long as he fought with Jinchi, his life would be in danger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>At this time, King Kong growled.</p><p>“Leave?”</p><p>Wen zhishi and Gong Fei’s faces were filled with unwillingness.</p><p>let’s go. Jinchi is extremely powerful. I’ve dealt with him before. Even if the four of us join forces, we’re definitely not his match. The difference is too great. We’ll only be killed!</p><p>Vajra growled and transmitted his voice to Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>King Kong was right. The Golden pool gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. Lu Ming felt that if they were to fight, even if he had the mountain and river diagram, he would not be able to defend against the other party’s attacks.</p><p>They might even be killed here.</p><p>Although the elixir of life was precious, there was no need to fight for it with his life.</p><p>Wen zhishi and Gong Fei also gritted their teeth. The four of them moved and quickly retreated, leaving the place far behind.</p><p>Jinchi smiled faintly. It was not because he was kind and did not want to kill them, but because he felt that Lu Ming and the other three were not simple. If they were to fight, even if he could kill them, he would have to spend some effort.</p><p>This Island was filled with poisonous insects and poisonous fog. It would save him a lot of effort and would be beneficial for his search for the totem pole. That was why he didn’t make a move.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have killed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>After he left, Wen Zhongyi sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything, but his gaze was more determined. In this world, strength spoke for itself. Without strength, it was useless to say anything.</p><p>The four of them continued to explore, but their direction did not change. They kept going deeper into the island.</p><p>This was because the totem pole was most likely deep within the island.</p><p>However, the deeper they went into the island, the thicker the poisonous fog became, and the more powerful it was.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared on Wen zhishi and Gong Fei’s bodies. A light shield enveloped them and blocked the poisonous gas around them.</p><p>The Vajra’s demonic power spread out and covered his entire body.</p><p>??…</p><p>The surrounding poisonous gas came into contact with the inscription light shield and demonic power, making a constant sizzling sound and corroding the light shield and demonic power.</p><p>Lu Ming was the most relaxed. His entire body was covered in a layer of devouring power. All the poisonous gas was devoured, and it did not affect Lu Ming’s movements at all.</p><p>This made Wen Qinyi and the rest click their tongues in wonder. In their hearts, Lu Ming was becoming more and more unfathomable.</p><p>Not long after, they saw a young man with a green face running back in panic. It was obvious that he was deeply poisoned.</p><p>The few of them had grave expressions on their faces as they advanced another few thousand miles.</p><p>At this point, the power of the poisonous gas was even more terrifying.</p><p>The light shield formed by Wen zhishi and Gong Fei’s formation was shaking and shaking violently on the island. The king Kong’s demonic power was the same. It was constantly resisting the poisonous gas and was consuming a lot of its energy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems that I can only go this far. I can’t go any deeper!”</p><p>Wen Zhongli shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“I’m the same!”</p><p>Gong Fei said.</p><p>King Kong also looked at Lu Ming with eager eyes.</p><p>If this continued, they would be in danger.</p><p>hmm, then you guys stay in the periphery and look for opportunities. I’ll continue to explore deeper!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He bade farewell to Wen Qinyi and the rest and left alone.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had traveled another few thousand miles. At this point, the power of the poisonous gas had reached a shocking level. There was no trace of the poisonous insects, let alone people.</p><p>Tap tap …</p><p>Lu Ming was cautious as he walked forward step by step. He did not know what kind of danger he would encounter here. He was on full alert and did not dare to move too fast.</p><p>“Eh? There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He saw a figure in front of him. The figure was also moving slowly. Clearly, it was much slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>“Luo Tian!”</p><p>As he walked closer, he realized that the young man in front of him was Luo Tian.</p><p>Luo Tian’s entire body was filled with demonic Qi. It formed a thick demonic Qi armor that covered his entire body and blocked the poisonous gas around him.</p><p>However, the poisonous gas was terrifyingly powerful. It constantly corroded the demonic Qi armor. It was obvious that Luo Tian was having a hard time moving forward.</p><p>Hearing the commotion, Luo Tian turned around and was shocked.</p><p>Obviously, he did not expect that other than himself and Jin Chi, there would be someone else who could make it this far.</p><p>However, when he saw the devouring power that was constantly permeating Lu Ming’s body, his eyes flashed.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored Luo Tian and strode forward. However, Luo Tian clearly had no intention of letting him go.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Tian took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>“Your Excellency, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>you should have a treasure that can resist the poisonous gas, right? give it to me!</p><p>Luo Tian said in a commanding tone.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It turned out that Luo Tian had regarded the devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline as some kind of treasure.</p><p>“Your Excellency, I don’t have any treasure that can resist the poisonous gas!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No? You still want to lie to me? Do you think I’m an idiot? If you didn’t have a treasure to resist the poisonous gas, how could you have come here? Hurry up and hand it over, or I’ll take it myself. It’ll be the same!”</p><p>Luo Tian sneered, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
