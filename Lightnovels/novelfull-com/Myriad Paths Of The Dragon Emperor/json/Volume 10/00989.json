He was standing in a desert. The sun was shining brightly and the temperature was terrifyingly high.</p><p>However, there were dark clouds and heavy rain in front of him. The difference was too great, and Lu Ming could not turn around.</p><p>“The chaos realm truly lives up to its name!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and flew forward.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>As soon as he flew into the area with heavy rain, the temperature dropped sharply and returned to normal. However, in the sky, a lightning bolt as thick as an arm struck directly at Lu Ming.</p><p>He activated his Thunder concept, and a lightning bolt as thick as an arm shot out and destroyed the lightning bolt.</p><p>Lightning flashed in the sky, and the next moment, another lightning struck.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the Thunder concept to resist.</p><p>such a strong Thunder mentality. This is a good place to comprehend the Thunder mentality!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was not in a hurry to move forward. Instead, he landed in the swamp below. He stepped on the water surface and moved forward slowly while comprehending the Thunder concept.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>what a strong water mentality! The water mentality here is even stronger than the Thunder mentality!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself, his eyes shining with hope.</p><p>He planned to comprehend the concept of water.</p><p>Now that the war of Providence had ended, there was no need to rush to increase his cultivation in the short term. Lu Ming planned to take this opportunity to comprehend the concept of water. Since he had the nine Dragon bloodline to devour, comprehending one more concept would not affect his cultivation speed too much.</p><p>Moreover, if he comprehended one more intent realm and fused five of them together, the power would be even stronger.</p><p>After making his decision, Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to comprehend.</p><p>With the blessing of fate, Lu Ming’s comprehension ability had increased by ten times. He was more in tune with the heaven and earth, and his comprehension speed was shocking.</p><p>First, it was the force of water!</p><p>In just a day’s time, Lu Ming had successfully comprehended the force of water and reached the elementary level.</p><p>next, I’ll have to fuse the force of water with the other intent realms. There’s endless Thunder here, so I can use the power of Thunder to fuse my intent realms!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He flew up and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Chi la! Chi la!</p><p>In the sky, endless lightning bolts struck toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming released the force of water and four other concepts.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not unleash much power from the other four concepts. He only used them for defense. He mainly used the lightning to bombard the force of water and the four concepts to achieve the effect of tempering.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The thunderous rumbles continued, and the lightning bolts continued to strike. The intent realm and momentum were both shaking.</p><p>not enough, the power of the lightning is not enough. Continue upwards!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly upwards. The closer he got to the clouds, the more terrifying the power of the lightning became. It kept bombarding the intent realm and the force of water.</p><p>“Right, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Now, his comprehension had increased tenfold, and even the speed at which he fused intents had increased greatly. He could fuse intents more effectively, faster, and more effectively.</p><p>With the help of the lightning, Lu Ming continued to temper himself.</p><p>In a short ten days, Lu Ming had successfully fused the force of water with the four concepts. This speed was already extremely shocking.</p><p>After the fusion was successful, Lu Ming could continue to improve his water concept.</p><p>Moreover, he had many Water-type profound meaning crystals with him. In combination with the environment, his terrifying comprehension ability, and the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s speed of improvement was simply terrifying. It was as if he was riding a rocket.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating in the water as he advanced.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming condensed the water concept rune in one go and raised his water concept to level one.</p><p>After that, the speed of his improvement had been increasing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>It was only when his water concept reached level two that the speed of improvement slowed down.</p><p>This was because at level two, one couldn’t just rely on intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the swamp for another half a month. His water concept had already been cultivated to level two upper tier.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had just crossed the swamp and arrived at an area with a more complicated terrain.</p><p>In this area, there were swamps filled with poisonous gas, terrifying storms, and even areas filled with blood Qi …</p><p>Once, he was almost cut in half by a blood-red sword light. The blood-red sword light was not man-made, but rushed out of a Blood Lake. The sword light had at least reached the level of a spiritual God.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move quickly. He cultivated as he hurried on his way.</p><p>He had left the talisman Amulet sect with the goal of cultivating. Although the chaotic domain was somewhat dangerous, it was still quite good for cultivation.</p><p>During this period, he didn’t only cultivate the water concept. He cultivated and comprehended all the other concepts.</p><p>He had some high-grade intent crystals, which he had taken from his enemies in the battle of Providence, such as Luo Tian and Wang fentian.</p><p>High-grade intent crystals were more useful than middle-grade spirit stones.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, low-grade intent crystals were for Kings, and they were extremely helpful in cultivating first level intent.</p><p>Middle-grade intent crystals corresponded to the sea of soul realm, and they were helpful for level two intent.</p><p>High-grade profound meaning crystals corresponded to the spirit embryo realm and were helpful to level three intent.</p><p>As for Supreme-grade intent crystals, they were equivalent to level four intent.</p><p>&Nbsp; of course, once one reached the third-level intent, it was extremely difficult to cultivate. Just relying on high-grade intent crystals wasn’t enough, but cultivating with high-grade intent crystals would still be much faster.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming hurried on his journey while cultivating.</p><p>The essence realm of heaven and earth and martial techniques were not left behind.</p><p>Dandan’s perception was very strong. Sometimes, when they encountered powerful existences, they would all go far away.</p><p>Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the chaos realm for three months.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming had experienced many things and encountered all kinds of terrain.</p><p>Even though he could sense danger, he had encountered danger more than ten times. The most dangerous time was when the sky suddenly split open and endless flames poured down. If it were not for Lu Ming’s sharp spiritual senses and quick reactions to avoid it from a distance, he would have been in danger that time.</p><p>That was because the flames were extremely terrifying. They poured down from the sky and turned an area of a hundred thousand miles into lava. Lu Ming broke out in cold sweat at the sight.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had also gained a lot along the way.</p><p>The wind, fire, and Thunder intents had all reached the peak of level three and were about to break through to level four.</p><p>His earth mentality had also reached the peak of level three upper tier.</p><p>As for the water concept, it had also broken through three levels and was now at the beginning of level three.</p><p>It was already very terrifying for the water concept to reach this stage so quickly. This was because Lu Ming had comprehended it on his own and not by devouring the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>However, his cultivation didn’t increase and remained at the early stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>His cultivation would only continue to improve when the water concept had caught up with the other concepts.</p><p>In addition to these, in terms of martial techniques, he was getting closer and closer to the seventh step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps. He believed that it would not take long for him to successfully cultivate the seventh step.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
