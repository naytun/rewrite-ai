It moved its body and turned into a black light, shooting toward King Kong.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! King Kong shouted. A big knife appeared in his hand and he slashed at the Scorpion accurately.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal hitting metal rang out, and Scorpion was sent flying far away. He crashed into the ground, creating a large pit.</p><p>But the next moment, the Scorpion shook its body and crawled out of the ground.</p><p>nest, what a tough body. It didn’t get cut in half by my saber!</p><p>King Kong was slightly surprised.</p><p>Although he had just casually slashed it, he was holding a seventh-level spiritual weapon. The poisonous Scorpion didn’t die from that slash.</p><p>No wonder he was able to kill a Young heaven’s pride expert.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The black poisonous Scorpion pounced at King Kong again.</p><p>“Damn it, do you think I’m easy to bully?”</p><p>King Kong grinned, put away his big blade, and swung his claw.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sharp claw radiance tore through the air and scratched the poisonous Scorpion, making an unpleasant sizzling sound. The poisonous Scorpion could not withstand King Kong’s sharp claws and was torn into pieces.</p><p>After that, the group became much more careful and headed deeper into the island. Their speed was also much slower.</p><p>“This is the poison Heart wood!”</p><p>After a hundred miles, Wen zhongtu suddenly stopped. He found a fragrant tree as thick as an arm.</p><p>“I didn’t expect there to be such a treasure here.”</p><p>Gong Fei’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>This was a top-notch level-seven spirit wood. If it was used to refine pills, it would have a powerful detoxification effect.</p><p>In a highly toxic place, there was an antidote.</p><p>“I’m afraid there are many treasures in this place!”</p><p>Gong Fei said.</p><p>“Let’s collect them first. When we get out of the sky Poison Island, we’ll divide them equally!”</p><p>Naturally, no one had any objections to Wen zhishi’s suggestion.</p><p>After that, Wen Zhongli dug out the poisonous heart wood and put it away.</p><p>As they continued to move forward, they discovered spiritual herbs from time to time. They were all at least level six, and some were even Level Seven. The most shocking thing was that they even found two level eight spiritual herbs.</p><p>Not only spiritual herbs, but also some precious ores. He also found a few.</p><p>“There’s a corpse!”</p><p>As they moved forward, they found a corpse, but it was already in tatters. It was obvious that it had been bitten by poisonous insects.</p><p>This place was full of opportunities, but it was also full of danger. More than a hundred people had come in, and it was unknown how many people would die Here.</p><p>Rustle …</p><p>Suddenly, a rustling sound came from the forest.</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s something in the ground!”</p><p>Gong Fei suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>On the ground in front of them, a large piece of land was protruding, and that protrusion was moving towards them at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Wen Zhongli stepped on the ground and a formation appeared. A battle sword formed and slashed towards the bump.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The protruding part was cut, but the next moment, everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>Countless black poisonous scorpions rushed out from the ground and charged toward the four of them.</p><p>They were densely packed, and it was unknown how many there were.</p><p>This poisonous Scorpion was exactly the same as the one he had seen before.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming, Wen Qishi and Gong Fei began to inscribe inscriptions at the same time.</p><p>A formation appeared on the ground, and a light screen appeared in front of the four.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Countless scorpions crashed into the light screen, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Following that, the light screens shattered one after another. Lu Ming and the rest’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>These light screens were all condensed by a level Seven primary formation technique, yet they were easily broken.</p><p>“Let’s go, there are too many scorpions, we can’t kill them all!”</p><p>run! Lu Ming shouted. The four of them turned around and ran at top speed.</p><p>Scorpion was in hot pursuit.</p><p>However, with every step that Lu Ming, Wen Zhongli, and Gong Fei took, a large array would appear on the ground, forming a light screen to block the poisonous scorpions. Therefore, the speed of the poisonous scorpions was greatly reduced. Before long, the four of them had shaken off the many poisonous scorpions.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a Scarlet object pierced through the air, emitting a disgusting smell. It was aimed at Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. With four concepts surrounding him, he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a huge force surge towards him. He couldn’t help but take two steps back, and the Scarlet thing was also sent flying.</p><p>“A fish?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but be shocked when he saw the thing that sneaked an attack on him.</p><p>It was a big colorful fish that was more than ten meters long. Its body was covered in scales, but it actually had a pair of wings. It flew in the air, and a Scarlet tongue stretched out from its big mouth.</p><p>It was this big fish that had sneaked an attack on Lu Ming just now.</p><p>“What kind of monster is this?”</p><p>Wen zhishi also said in a deep voice.</p><p>Gah gah!</p><p>The big fish let out a strange cry. It flapped its wings and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed out. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and slashed at the strange fish with his palm.</p><p>The strange fish’s Scarlet tongue curled like a soft whip and rolled toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His palm struck the strange fish’s tongue and the tongue exploded. Lu Ming did not stop and continued to charge at the strange fish.</p><p>The strange fish let out a strange cry and spat out a dense green poisonous gas from its mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his devouring power and covered his body, instantly devouring the poisonous gas. He dashed forward and struck the head of the strange fish with his palm. The strange fish exploded with a bang.</p><p>The strength of this strange fish was not weaker than the third level of the spirit embryo realm. With the addition of the poisonous gas, it was even more terrifying. However, when it encountered Lu Ming, it was naturally killed easily.</p><p>However, this also showed how dangerous it was.</p><p>After all, how many people could have combat strength like Lu Ming’s? many geniuses would die when they encountered this strange fish.</p><p>“There seems to be something over there?”</p><p>King Kong’s nose twitched a few times, as if he had smelled something. He looked to the right.</p><p>That was the direction where the strange fish had appeared.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The four of them went to the right, and not long after, a few more strange fish appeared and charged at them.</p><p>“These strange fish seem to be guarding something? There should be a treasure!”</p><p>The four of them seemed to have thought of something and attacked with all their might. A few strange fish were easily killed and they continued to move forward.</p><p>Along the way, they killed more than a dozen strange fish. They saw a cliff wall, and on the cliff wall, there was a small puddle.</p><p>“That’s the elixir of life!”</p><p>Wen Zhongli cried out in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming, Jin Gang, and Gong Fei’s eyes widened abruptly.</p><p>There was a milky-white liquid in the small puddle, and it gave off a shocking amount of life essence.</p><p>“Elixir of life, it’s the elixir of life!”</p><p>Lu Ming said excitedly.</p><p>He had once bid for a small bottle of elixir of life at an auction in the great domain. However, it had been diluted and the concentration was very low, so it couldn’t be considered the real elixir of life.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would never forget that aura.</p><p>The small puddle in front of him was the real water of life.</p><p>The elixir of life was an unparalleled treasure. It was extremely rare in the world.</p><p>It could resurrect the dead and grow flesh on bones. Its effect was heaven-defying. As long as one was still breathing, it could be saved. No matter how heavy the injuries suffered, it could be healed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
