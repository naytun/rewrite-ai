A few of us have already died in there!</p><p>...</p><p>Di Feng secretly glanced at Lu Ming with a flash of killing intent. He then answered Wang Yan’s question.</p><p>“Hidden killing intent? Then send more people to test the waters. You guys go!”</p><p>Wang Yan pointed at a few men of sacrifice who were carrying longswords on their backs.</p><p>These men of sacrifice were not afraid of death at all. They were expressionless when they heard this. Two of them stepped forward and rushed into the canyon.</p><p>The canyon was surrounded by clouds and mist. From a distance, it was a blur.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, something shot out from both sides of the canyon, fast as lightning.</p><p>Sword light flashed as the two men of sacrifice pulled out their swords and slashed out sword lights.</p><p>To be honest, these death Warriors had pretty good combat strength. They reached the peak ninth level spiritual ocean realm and instantly shattered those things.</p><p>“It looks like a tree root!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. The things that rushed out from the two sides of the canyon did look like tree roots.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As the two dare-to-die fighters pushed forward, more and more powerful attacks rushed out from both sides. Gradually, the two dare-to-die fighters couldn’t resist them anymore and were finally entangled by the endless tree root-like things.</p><p>those things that look like tree roots should be plant-type creatures. Let the earth death Warriors block them while we charge in!</p><p>Wang Yan said.</p><p>Di Feng nodded. With a wave of his hand, a few men of sacrifice carrying large hammers rushed in.</p><p>Tentacle-like things also reached out. The death warrior picked up the hammer and smashed it on the ground. BOOM! A row of stone walls appeared on the ground, blocking the attack of the tentacles.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>At this moment, Wang Yan, di Feng, Shi Xiao, and the others all rushed in.</p><p>“It’s a death warrior who has cultivated the earth essence realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered. These men of sacrifice with big hammers on their backs were all men of sacrifice who had cultivated the will of the earth. This made Lu Ming very tempted. If he devoured their will runes, his will of the earth would definitely be able to reach a higher level. By then, his cultivation would be able to improve further.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed in.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The walls on both sides of the canyon seemed to have come alive. Tentacle-like things kept extending from inside. They were tough and sharp, and they kept piercing through and winding around them.</p><p>The earth death Warriors controlled the earth and blocked it with stone walls.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, an endless amount of sword Qi poured out, cutting off the tentacles one by one.</p><p>As for Wang Yan, with a wave of his hand, terrifying flames spread out, turning those tentacles into ashes.</p><p>As for the corpse puppet, it was more unique. It was as if it was not afraid of death. It charged forward and waved its hand. Those tentacles that came into contact with it were directly broken by it.</p><p>“This body, no, it’s like a refined corpse!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He felt that the corpse puppet’s body did not seem like a human body. Instead, it was like a refined corpse. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A few tentacles tried to wrap around Lu Ming but were broken by him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Bright red liquid flowed out of the tentacle.</p><p>“It really looks like a tree root!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that these tentacles were similar to tree roots but they seemed to be alive.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more roots there were. However, with everyone working together, including experts like Wang Yan, corpse puppet, and Lu Ming, they naturally had nothing to fear and continued to advance.</p><p>All of a sudden, the roots on both sides retracted. They had reached the end of the canyon.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In front of them, a few huge figures blocked their way.</p><p>They were a few huge demonic beasts. No, they should be fierce beasts.</p><p>In fact, there was no difference between demonic beasts and fierce beasts.</p><p>However, after demonic beasts had more contact with humans, they would understand the human language and could take human form.</p><p>On the other hand, ferocious beasts were more primitive beasts. They were fiercer and disdained to transform into human form. They had always maintained their beast appearance.</p><p>Three of them appeared before him. They were ferocious beasts, and they exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>The first tier of the seventh level was equivalent to the aura of the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>three class 1 level 7 fierce beasts. How about we take one each? ”</p><p>The corpse puppet looked at Wang Yan and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“This is only fair!”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed coldly, as he secretly transmitted a message to di Feng,”When we make our move, you guys take the opportunity to rush in. There’s most likely a treasure in this Canyon.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Di Feng secretly replied.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, the corpse puppet and Lu Ming charged forward at the same time.</p><p>The three beasts roared and charged at them.</p><p>Wang Yan made his move as well, each of them taking on one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s opponent was a rat-like ferocious beast. It was pitch-black and extremely fast. Its teeth, claws, and tail were all extremely powerful weapons.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The rat’s tail twitched like a soft whip, cutting through the space and making a sharp whistling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and swung his fist, bombarding it with an overbearing force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His fist landed on the rat’s tail and it almost exploded. The beast was in pain and let out a sharp cry. It clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch.</p><p>At this moment, Wang Yan and the corpse puppet were also engaged in battle with the other two beasts.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Di Feng seized the opportunity and rushed in with his men.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites from the sky corpse sect and the sky demon Valley also rushed in.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed heavily on the rat’s claws. A violent force erupted wildly. The rat shrieked and was sent flying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming caught up with him. A long spear appeared in his hand and he struck out.</p><p>With a plop, it pierced through the rat’s mouth and killed it.</p><p>A first grade seventh level beast was killed by Lu Ming with ease.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Wang Yan and the corpse puppet also ended their battle and killed the demonic beasts.</p><p>Although they hadn’t entered the spirit embryo realm, their battle prowess was so strong that they could almost easily kill a first level spirit embryo realm. Even if they faced an ordinary second level spirit embryo realm, they wouldn’t lose and might even win.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, a few screams came from the valley.</p><p>Wang Yan’s expression changed as he rushed in.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and rushed in.</p><p>Inside the canyon was a huge plot of land. It was very wide, and in front of it was a towering tree. It was very eye-catching.</p><p>As for di Feng and the others, they were surrounded by a few beasts. There were already a few corpses on the ground.</p><p>There were six demonic beasts in total, and each of them had reached Class 1 Lv 7.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Wang Yan, and the corpse puppet’s attention was drawn to the large tree.</p><p>On the tree, there were ten bright red fruits that exuded a mysterious aura.</p><p>thousand-elephant fruit! That’s a thousand-elephant fruit!</p><p>Wang Yan shouted, his eyes filled with greed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also greatly shocked.</p><p>It was actually a thousand elephant fruit.</p><p>It was a magical fruit that could transform the will of nature into anything. If a warrior swallowed it, the fruit would transform into the will of nature that he or she wanted to understand. It could make the warrior’s will of heaven and earth improve by leaps and bounds, and even break through the bottleneck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
