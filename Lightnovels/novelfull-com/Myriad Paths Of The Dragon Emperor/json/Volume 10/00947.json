Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>Two blood-colored astral blades slashed down at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He strode forward and slapped twice.</p><p>With two crisp sounds, the two blood-red sword gleams were shattered.</p><p>The pupils of the two young men from the bloodblade continent contracted rapidly, and their eyes revealed extreme shock.</p><p>The two of them had used almost all their strength in the two slashes just now, but they were easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a top expert, let’s go!”</p><p>The mole-faced young man shouted and turned to run.</p><p>The other person felt the same way. They knew that they had encountered one of the top elites of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He took a step forward and his body was like a stream of light. In the next moment, he had caught up with the two of them and struck out with his palms twice.</p><p>Although the two of them tried their best to block, they were still hit and spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They crashed into the ground and left a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming descended, and his immense aura enveloped the two of them. He said coldly, ” speak, where are the people from the divine wilderness continent? ”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. If I say it, won’t I still die? Anyway, I won’t tell you if I die!”</p><p>The mole-faced young man’s eyes were filled with madness. At the same time, a blood-red light flashed, and the blood in his body seemed to be burning. With a loud roar, he turned into a blade light and rushed in a direction.</p><p>The other young man also looked crazy. He turned into a blade light and rushed in another direction.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>With the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, Lu Ming was the first to chase after the young man with the big mole. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, how fast would he be if he used the nine Dragons heaven treading steps? He caught up to the mole-faced young man in a few moments and killed him with a punch.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming turned around and charged at another person.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>That person was extremely crazy. Seeing that he could not escape, his eyes turned red and he charged towards Lu Ming like a wild beast.</p><p>However, there was a huge difference in their abilities and they were easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows slightly. The cultivation technique of the people from the bloodblade continent was overbearing and they were not afraid of death. They were extremely crazy, and Lu Ming did not manage to get any information from them.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared and devoured the blood essence and energy of the two young men from the bloodblade continent.</p><p>just now, the two of them were heading north. Perhaps, if we head north, we might be able to find something!</p><p>With an idea in mind, Lu Ming flew North.</p><p>To the North of Lu Ming, a million miles away, a huge battle was going on in the mountains.</p><p>On a mountain peak, light flickered and was incomparably dazzling. Inscriptions filled the air and many large arrays appeared, forming a light barrier that covered the entire mountain peak within.</p><p>There were about a few hundred people on the mountain peak.</p><p>All of them were disciples of the talisman sect. Some of them were sitting cross-legged, while others were constantly inscribing inscriptions around the mountain.</p><p>The one in the lead had long silver hair and two eyes. He was huanzhen.</p><p>With him as the leader, Wen Qinyi, Bai chixue, Ji mai and the others were also among them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Outside the mountain peak, a blood-red blade light rose. It was extremely terrifying, as if it wanted to split the heavens and earth apart. It slashed towards huanzhen and the others.</p><p>The blade light struck the light shield, causing it to tremble. Huanzhen and the others also trembled slightly.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people around the mountain peak, but a few of them had shocking auras and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Every one of them was wearing a blood-red robe and carrying a blood-red saber.</p><p>He was dressed exactly the same as the two youths from the bloodblade continent that Lu Ming had met before.</p><p>“Talisman Amulet sect, with your measly strength, you can all die!”</p><p>A young man with long blood-red hair said coldly.</p><p>His strength was the most terrifying, and his aura was powerful. With a single slash, the light shield trembled violently.</p><p>“Why are you so ruthless? our Talisman Amulet sect has no intention of fighting with you for the last totem pole!”</p><p>Huan Zhen said.</p><p>hehe, a bunch of flies. They’re in the way. Moreover, you have quite a lot of luck points. You’ll be a piece of fat meat even if I snatch you!</p><p>The blood-red haired youth laughed coldly.</p><p>The other young men also sneered. More than a dozen of them attacked together, and the blade light kept slashing toward the mountain peak.</p><p>Wen Zhongli, Bai chixue and the rest were trembling. They had used up a lot of their spiritual power. If this continued, their spiritual power would be completely depleted.</p><p>Once they lost the protection of the formation, the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples would be killed by the other party.</p><p>The other party was too powerful. This was only a portion of the bloodblade continent’s people, but there were two people who were on the same level as Huan Zhen.</p><p>Once the formation was broken, Huan Zhen could only stop one person. The other person could easily kill the others. Furthermore, the other ten or so young men were also extremely powerful.</p><p>Some people revealed bitter expressions. The battle for Providence this time was beyond their imagination. To think that the chosen of other continents would intervene. It was even more dangerous than the previous battles for Providence. If they didn’t handle it well, the talisman sect would be completely annihilated.</p><p>I’ll inscribe a formation later to block them with all my strength. You guys hurry up and leave!</p><p>Huan Zhen suddenly sent a message to Wen Zhongli, Bai chixue and the others.</p><p>senior brother huanzhen, we can’t leave together!</p><p>Wen Zhongli said hurriedly.</p><p>If Huan Zhen left only one person to stop them, they would definitely be in trouble.</p><p>“That’s right, we’ll leave together and stay together.”</p><p>The others also called out.</p><p>“None of you can escape, Blood God’s saber wheel! Break!”</p><p>The young man with long blood-red hair shouted coldly. An even more terrifying aura burst out from his body. A huge blood-red Wheel appeared above his head. This blood-red Wheel seemed to be made up of countless blood-red sabers. It spun rapidly and was as big as a mountain. It crushed toward the light shield on the mountain.</p><p>“Not good, hold on!”</p><p>Huan Zhen and the others ‘expressions changed. The mental energy fire between their brows throbbed rapidly, spreading out and surging into the inscriptions around them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blood-colored wheel of blades hit the light shield of the mountain heavily.</p><p>The earth rumbled and the mountain shook violently. The light shields that covered the mountain shattered one after another.</p><p>&Nbsp; Huan Zhen and the others ‘expressions changed and their bodies trembled. Those with lower cultivation spat out blood.</p><p>The disciples who were sitting cross-legged or in the middle of recovery or healing also stood up to help guard the array.</p><p>However, the blood-red Wheel of blades was too terrifying. It kept spinning like countless sabers, constantly slashing at the light shield.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The light shield continued to explode and was about to be completely shattered.</p><p>“Release the puppets and use the inscription scrolls to open up a path. Charge out!”</p><p>Huanzhen shouted.</p><p>At this moment, with a loud bang, all the arrays collapsed and the light shield was shattered. Many talisman puppet sect disciples released their puppets and surrounded the crowd. At the same time, a series of inscription scrolls were activated, either to protect themselves or to attack, and they all rushed in one direction.</p><p>“You want to escape? all of you, die!”</p><p>The red-haired young man controlled the huge wheel of blades and pressed forward, shattering countless puppets.</p><p>More than a dozen blade lights slashed out, attacking the puppet and the inscription scrolls.</p><p>Although the talisman Amulet sect had many people, most of their combat strength was not strong. They were far from the top experts of the bloodblade continent.</p><p>The weakest of the dozen or so people from the bloodblade continent were fourth level spirit embryo realm prodigies.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Screams rang out as a talisman sect disciple was killed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
