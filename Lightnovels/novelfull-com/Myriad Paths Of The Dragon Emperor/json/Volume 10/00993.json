This man was their second uncle’s son, their cousin, and they had never been on good terms.</p><p>“It can cure grandfather’s poison? Nonsense, many alchemists couldn’t cure it, so how could this brat? Don’t be fooled by this kid.”</p><p>Desolate ning raised his eyebrows and shouted.</p><p>“Hmph, big brother Lu is our friend. Why would he lie to us? besides, if we don’t let big brother Lu try, how would we know if he can’t do it? Alright, get out of the way!”</p><p>Having said that, a-Qing pulled Lu Ming and walked around desolate ning, heading inside.</p><p>Desolate ning’s face was gloomy.</p><p>A ‘an led Lu Ming past a few courtyards and finally came to a guest room. brother Lu, you can stay here and recuperate. It won’t be too late to cure my grandfather’s poison after you’ve recovered!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After chatting for a while more, the two sisters left.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the room and closed the door. He sat cross-legged on the bed and began to channel his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>The war Dragon true energy circulated throughout his body and seeped deep into his body. Lu Ming’s injuries were healing rapidly.</p><p>In fact, during the two days on the road, Lu Ming’s body had been recovering on its own. By now, he had recovered a lot.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>More than ten minutes later, Lu Ming was recuperating when the door was pushed open. A young man was standing at the door with a cold face.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly. He opened his eyes, and a cold glint flashed across them.</p><p>Desolate ning. The one who pushed open his door was desolate ning.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s ability to control himself was strong enough. He was also distracted and did not devote himself to it. Otherwise, if he was disturbed during his cultivation, he would be injured at the very least, or even suffer from Qi deviation in the worst case.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Kid, what’s your purpose in coming to the Xiao family? Don’t tell me you think that ah Zhen and ah Lei are innocent and want to lie to them. Let me tell you, if you have this idea, you’re wrong!”</p><p>Desolate ning said coldly.</p><p>brother Xiao, you’ve misunderstood. I’m friends with miss a ‘Lei and a’ Zhen. I’ve been injured, so I want to use the Xiao family to heal my injuries. I happen to know some ways to detoxify the poison. I heard that the old man of the Xiao family was poisoned by the seven-colored snake, so I wanted to see if I could help him detoxify it!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and explained with a smile.</p><p>“Shut up, Who Do You Think You Are? Are you worthy of being my brother? Don’t think that I don’t know that you’re intentionally trying to get close to those two girls because of their looks and innocence. There’s no way you’re getting close to them. You’d better leave the Xiao family quickly, otherwise …”</p><p>Desolate ning sneered.</p><p>“Desolate ning, what are you doing?”</p><p>A delicate voice was heard, and then two beautiful figures appeared.</p><p>It was ah Luo and ah Lei.</p><p>“Xiao ning, big brother Lu is our friend. If you let him go again, I might turn against you!”</p><p>The two sisters walked over, and a-Qing gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Seeing ah Luo and her sister coming over, Xiao ning knew that he had missed the opportunity. He snorted coldly, waved his sleeves and strode away.</p><p>“I heard someone say that Xiao ning was coming this way, so I knew that something bad was going to happen. Fortunately, we arrived in time. Brother Lu, are you alright?”</p><p>A-Qing said with some concern.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“En, I will have people keep an eye on desolate ning for the next few days. If he comes again, I’ll definitely turn against him. So you should rest well!”</p><p>Having said that, the two sisters bade Lu Ming farewell.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to his room, he continued to cultivate and heal his injuries.</p><p>After that, no one bothered Lu Ming anymore. Three days later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>As for dandan, he had thrown her into the mountain and river diagram to let her recover on her own.</p><p>This fellow’s vitality was extremely tenacious, and nothing would happen to him.</p><p>After Lu Ming recovered, he found a ‘an and a’ Lei and went to their grandfather’s room together.</p><p>The Xiao family’s old man lived in the Xiao family’s main residence. The three of them were stopped as soon as they arrived.</p><p>One of them was desolate ning, and the other was a middle-aged man in his fifties with a cold expression.</p><p>“Second uncle!”</p><p>A-Qing’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>This person was a-Qing’s second uncle, Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>The old man of the Xiao family had two sons. One was the Father of a ‘ke and a’ Lei, and the other was Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>“Ah Zhen, ah Lei, the place where father recuperates is right in front. What do you want to do by bringing a stranger here?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said with a straight face.</p><p>Ah Lei’s body trembled slightly, and she took a step back. She was clearly a little afraid of Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>A-Qing was much more courageous. She took a step forward and said, ” second uncle, this is our friend, Lu Shaoqing. Big brother Lu can cure grandfather’s poison, so we brought him here to help him.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun flicked his sleeve and berated,”We’ve invited many alchemists and apothecaries over this period of time, and we’ve tried many methods, but none of them could cure your grandfather’s poison. How could this kid possibly cure your grandfather’s poison? these two little girls don’t know the evil of the world. Be careful not to be deceived!”</p><p>second uncle, you’re thinking too much. Why would big brother Lu lie to us? why don’t we let him try? it’s not like we’ll lose anything!</p><p>A-Qing argued.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s face darkened. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Kid, are you an inscriber?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>He had thought that since he was new here, he should be more polite to others. He did not make a fuss about it with the Xiao family on account of the sisters, ah Lei and ah Luo. However, Xiao Hongyun and his son had repeatedly made things difficult for him and spoke unkindly. Lu Ming could not help but feel a little angry. Naturally, his tone was not very good.</p><p>“Haha, since you’re not an inscription master, how can you claim that you can cure my father? What a joke, hurry up and leave the Xiao family, and I’ll let this matter go!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun laughed contemptuously and waved his hand.</p><p>“Who said that one has to be an inscription master to cure the poison? I have a secret technique that can easily detoxify the poison!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Nonsense, you’re talking big!”</p><p>Desolate ning interrupted sarcastically.</p><p>“We believe in big brother Lu. Besides, second uncle also said that we’ve invited so many alchemists over this period of time, but none of them could cure grandfather’s poison. Are we just going to let it go and let grandfather die from the poison? At this moment, we must seize any chance. I must let brother Lu give it a try. If you are worried, you can watch from the side!”</p><p>A-Qing said, her gaze extremely firm.</p><p>Ah Lei also stepped forward and stared at Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun frowned and muttered to himself, alright, let him try. We’ll watch from the side. But an Alchemist just came and fed father an antidote pill. We’ll see how it goes today. If father doesn’t get better by tomorrow, we’ll let this kid try!</p><p>“Alright, tomorrow it is!”</p><p>A-Qing was overjoyed.</p><p>“Also, don’t run around these few days. After a few days, pack your things and follow me to the floating mountain to see young master Ling yunkong!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun changed the topic.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the two sisters ‘expressions changed greatly.</p><p>“No, I will never go to the floating mountain to see Ling yunkong!”</p><p>A-Qing called out.</p><p>“Nonsense! Who is young master Ling yunkong? He’s one of the top ten Young heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school. His innate talent is unparalleled and rarely seen in the world. For him to have taken a fancy to you guys, it’s your eight lifetimes worth of good fortune. Don’t you know how to treasure it?”</p><p>let me tell you, this is a matter of the Xiao family’s future. You can’t afford to throw a tantrum. You have to go even if you don’t want to. We’ll set off in seven days!</p><p>With that, Xiao Hongyun waved his sleeves and strode away.</p><p>Desolate ning smiled complacently and left as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
