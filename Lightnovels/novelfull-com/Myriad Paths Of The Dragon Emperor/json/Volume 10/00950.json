If he had been any later, the battle of Providence would have ended directly.</p><p>...</p><p>It was no wonder that his cultivation had soared so quickly. In the past five months, he had advanced three cultivation realms. That was not too fast.</p><p>After all, he had the bloodline of the nine Dragons. If he were to fight with the three-eyed God race outside, he might be able to increase his cultivation by two or three levels.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you went deep into the sky Poison Island and never came back. The poisonous gas inside was too strong, and we couldn’t go in. We were really afraid that something had happened to you. What happened to you on the sky Poison Island?”</p><p>Wen Zhongli asked.</p><p>Lu Ming then told him about his encounter with the three-eyed God.</p><p>Everyone clicked their tongues in wonder.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually encountered the attacks of more than ten spiritual gods from the three-eyed God race on the sky Poison Island. Furthermore, the battle in his sea of consciousness had lasted for several months. In the end, his skills had even improved greatly. It was truly amazing.</p><p>After all, when a spiritual God Realm master lost his physical body, his spiritual God would not stay in the world for long and would dissipate.</p><p>Only some special treasures could allow the spirit God to be preserved. The totem pole of the sky Poison Island was probably that kind of treasure.</p><p>However, there was something strange about it. Even the totems of the other eight forbidden areas did not have a spirit God attached to them. Lu Ming guessed that it was most likely related to the sky Poison Island. There was not a trace of poisonous gas in that cave. Instead, it was filled with spiritual Qi and origin Qi.</p><p>Wen zhishi was good with words. He immediately started to explain what had happened during this period of time.</p><p>About half a month ago, the nine forbidden grounds were all broken and the nine totem pillars were obtained.</p><p>Only the final totem pillar in the three-eyed God race’s capital remained. As long as he obtained this final totem pillar, he would be able to open the ancient city of Providence.</p><p>However, at this moment, a heaven’s favorite from another continent appeared. It was the heaven’s favorite from the bloodblade continent.</p><p>As soon as the blood Blade continent’s heaven’s favorites entered, they started to kill. Many of the four Overlord forces ‘heaven’s favorites were killed.</p><p>After the slaughter, they knew that the prodigies of the bloodblade continent were also participating in the battle for Providence. They had also completed their mission, and their final goal was the final totem pillar in the three-eyed God race’s capital.</p><p>If the bloodblade continent could obtain that totem pillar, they would be able to open their ancient City of Providence.</p><p>Whoever managed to obtain the last totem pillar would be able to open the ancient city of Providence, and those who failed to do so would be considered to have failed.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites of the bloodblade continent were very powerful, even slightly stronger than those of the East continent. More importantly, they were all very United and seemed to come from the same force.</p><p>The four overlords of the eastern barren territory were too scattered and suffered a crushing defeat in the beginning.</p><p>In the end, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley had to join forces to have the strength to contend with the bloodblade continent.</p><p>As for the talisman Amulet sect, they were directly excluded by the three major factions. They refused to let the talisman Amulet sect join. It was obvious that they wanted to use the bloodblade continent to destroy the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect had been hiding under the leadership of the zongzis from fantasy reality. However, they were still found by the bloodblade continent two days ago, which was why they had fought.</p><p>“AI, it’s a pity that Guan Tao, Liu Song, and a few others have all died in battle!”</p><p>Wen zhishi sighed.</p><p>Guan Tao and Liu Song were the talisman sect’s top 100 talents on the list of top 1000 talents. They were also one of the 13 zongzis.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the talisman sect members and realized that many of them were missing.</p><p>Out of the 13 candidates of the talisman sect, only six were present, seven were missing.</p><p>The total number of people from the talisman Amulet sect was only slightly more than three hundred.</p><p>“Are these the only people left in the talisman Amulet sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>almost there. Even if there are some who are still in the ruins, there are definitely not many!</p><p>Wen zhishi sighed.</p><p>The other talisman sect disciples also looked dejected.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect had a total of about a thousand people, but now there were only about three hundred left. The losses were extremely heavy.</p><p>One had to know that these were the elites of the talisman sect’s younger generation.</p><p>In every battle of Providence, a large number of geniuses would die in battle.</p><p>However, every time there was a battle of Providence, the major factions would send all their geniuses in. This was because once someone obtained a great opportunity, all the sacrifices would be worth it.</p><p>For example, this time, Bai chixue had obtained the inheritance of the Emperor. Even if hundreds of people died in the battle, it was worth it.</p><p>The inheritance of an Emperor was extremely precious. Not only could it bring many different formations and inscriptions to the talisman sect, but also Bai chixue’s future would be limitless.</p><p>Even if she could not reach the height of an Emperor in the future, as long as she could become a Supreme Being, it would be worth it.</p><p>we’d better leave this place first. I’m afraid that the other heaven’s favorites from the bloodblade continent will soon find out that their heaven’s favorite has been killed. At that time, they will come to kill us. We will be in real danger!</p><p>Huan Zhen said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Wen zhishi nodded.</p><p>“All of you, enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the mountain and river diagram flew toward him. The wheel of blades, having lost its owner, stood still in the air and was put away by Lu Ming.</p><p>Huan Zhen and the rest had long heard that Lu Ming had a treasure like the mountain and river diagram. They were overjoyed to hear that.</p><p>As long as they entered the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming would bring them to another place alone. The people from the bloodblade continent would definitely not be able to find them.</p><p>Immediately, the talisman Amulet sect members were kept into the mountain and river diagram. Lu Ming put the mountain and river diagram away, turned into a rainbow light, and left the place.</p><p>In a Valley millions of miles away, Lu Ming appeared and released the people from the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>Some of the injured disciples began to heal their injuries, while those who were not injured began to carve formations around them.</p><p>There were only five days left until the one-year deadline. They had no intention of looking for any more opportunities. They just had to wait for the last five days to pass.</p><p>right now, the heaven’s favorites from the bloodblade continent and the Emperor sky divine Palace should be near the royal city, waiting for an opportunity to get the last totem pillar, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. There are still five days left. They will definitely make a move in these few days. Otherwise, they won’t have the chance anymore. If they don’t get the last totem pillar, then all the luck they’ve obtained during this period of time will be wasted. The top heaven’s favorites will definitely not be satisfied with this.</p><p>Huan Zhen nodded.</p><p>in fact, the bloodblade continent and the three-party alliance had already fought once before to attack the royal city. However, there were extremely powerful existences in the royal city, experts who were infinitely close to the spiritual God Realm and could easily attack the spiritual God Realm. Last time, there was an expert of that level who attacked and forcefully broke into the spiritual God Realm, killing several powerful geniuses from both sides. However, in the end, the three-eyed God who forced his way into the spiritual God Realm also exploded and died! They must have been suppressed to death by the laws of heaven and earth of this world.”</p><p>Wen zhishi explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was normal for the three-eyed God race to have such existences.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm experts that Lu Ming encountered on the sky Poison Island were all elders of the three-eyed God race who were nearing the end of their lifespans. They had no choice but to give it their all and attempt to break through to the spiritual God Realm. In the end, they were suppressed.</p><p>However, there were definitely some within the three-eyed God race that had yet to reach the end of their lifespans and could break through to the spiritual God stage at any time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
