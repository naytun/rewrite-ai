Lu Ming, you’ve delivered yourself to our door. That’s great. It saves us the trouble of looking for you!</p><p>...</p><p>Wang Chen stopped and let out a wild laugh.</p><p>“Stop them, don’t let them escape!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Sheng Xingchen shouted and dashed toward Lu Ming and Ji mai with a few other young men.</p><p>Ji Mai’s eyes were filled with solemness. However, he held back his words when he saw Lu Ming’s calm expression.</p><p>In the next moment, a few young men, including the sacred constellation, surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of them, Wang haoxian looked worried.</p><p>“Lu Ming, at least you know your place. You know that you can’t run away, so you didn’t. However, even if you stay and beg for mercy, you’ll still die today!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen’s eyes flickered with killing intent. At the same time, he looked confident.</p><p>If he was not afraid of Ji mai, he would have already attacked.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at the sacred constellation.</p><p>He could see the cultivation of Holy constellation with a single glance.</p><p>Peak of the first level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>The cultivation of the sacred constellation had actually soared to this level. He must have obtained a great opportunity. Otherwise, it was impossible for it to rise to this level.</p><p>Back then, he had only been ranked at the bottom of the list of top 1000 talents on the Holy star. Now, he had actually made it to this level. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>With this cultivation, he could already make it into the top 200.</p><p>“You, what did you say? Bastard, what did you say?”</p><p>The Holy constellation was furious that Lu Ming had called him an idiot in such a contemptuous manner.</p><p>Now that his cultivation level had improved greatly, he was confident that he could easily suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>a loser who thinks he can be so arrogant in front of me just because he has some cultivation. If he isn’t an idiot, what is he? ”</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at the sacred constellation and then looked away to the front.</p><p>Wang Chen held Wang haoxian’s shoulder and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I can’t help but be impressed by your abilities. Even The Prodigy of the Wang family has fallen to your enigma. You’re so close to me despite our grudges. You’re really a b * tch, a b * tch. Today, I’ll kill you with my own hands in front of this b * tch and make her despair!”</p><p>Wang Chen stared at Wang haoxian coldly.</p><p>“You’d better let her go. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>hahaha, your heart hurts. Then I’ll make your heart hurt even more!</p><p>Pa!</p><p>As he spoke, Wang Chen slapped Wang haoxian across the face. A handprint appeared on Wang haoxian’s face and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Wang haoxian glared at Wang Chen.</p><p>“B * tch, keep staring and I’ll dig out your eyes!”</p><p>Wang Chen shouted coldly.</p><p>Wang haoxian, don’t worry. I will make you pay for this slap.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression calmed down, but his voice was very cold.</p><p>“Young master Wang Chen, there’s no need for you to kill this b * stard. Let me do it. I have a grudge against Lu Ming. I’ll kill him with my own hands today!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen said.</p><p>there’s no need to kill him. Just cripple his cultivation first. I want him to beg for death!</p><p>Wang Chen said coldly.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>After saying that, Sheng Xingchen strode out. Starlight emanated from his body, and seven stars appeared above his head.</p><p>The three golden chakras of the Big Dipper bloodline were shining.</p><p>The sacred constellation had successfully awakened the seven stars of the Big Dipper bloodline, reaching the third level of the divine level. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know that you’ve awakened a second level divine level Blood Meridian. I can crush you now!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen’s eyes were bright and full of confidence.</p><p>Back in ninedragons, the blood Meridian that Lu Ming had displayed was a second level divine Blood Meridian.</p><p>nonsense. Hurry up and attack. I’ll give you three chances to attack. Try your best. This is the last chance I’m giving you. You won’t have a chance to attack in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly.</p><p>“You’re talking big, die!”</p><p>The Saint constellation was boiling with Starlight, and it condensed into a starry long sword. It exuded a terrifying aura and stabbed toward Lu Ming’s dantian. He wanted to cripple Lu Ming’s cultivation in one move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The starry longsword cut through the void like a shooting star streaking across the sky at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood still, as if he did not see the sword gleam. He did not even release his protective essential core.</p><p>you’re acting. I’ll see how you die if you’re acting in front of me.</p><p>Sheng Xingchen’s eyes were cold. His vital essence burst out, and the speed of the long sword increased.</p><p>Just as the long sword was about to hit Lu Ming, he moved and swung his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the palm hit the stars sword, the stars sword crumbled like tofu.</p><p>Sheng Xingchen was so scared that his eyes almost popped out. He exploded with all his power to stop his body from moving forward and retreated backward.</p><p>After retreating a thousand meters, Holy star finally stopped. Then, his face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This was not because he was injured by Lu Ming. He had originally continued to charge forward, but he had forcefully stopped his body and retreated. This reversal was too great. Under the surge of his essential core, he had suffered internal injuries.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Holy constellation roared in his heart, and his ashamed face turned green and red.</p><p>Lu Ming had not even made a move and he had already injured himself. It was really embarrassing.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s slap just now was truly shocking. It had actually destroyed his sword gleam so easily. He had retreated in shock.</p><p>what an idiot. First move, two more moves, treasure the opportunity!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his smile was full of contempt.</p><p>“Die, die! Lu Ming, go to hell! Seven Star Heart-killing sword!”</p><p>The Saint Starlight roared and its eyes turned red. The Big Dipper glowed in the endless void. It seemed to have turned into a sword light, falling from the sky and slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>This strike was extremely terrifying. It was several times stronger than the previous one.</p><p>On the side, the other young men had grave expressions on their faces. The battle prowess of the sacred constellation had made them serious.</p><p>In an instant, the sword light landed on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did the same as before and slapped him.</p><p>With a bang, the sword light shattered. It was no different from the last time.</p><p>At the scene, the others were stunned.</p><p>It was beyond the expectations of many people that Lu Ming could defeat the attack of the Holy constellation so easily.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s combat strength is not weak!”</p><p>Wang Chen said, but his tone was still relaxed.</p><p>That was because the sacred constellation was no different from an ant in his eyes. Even if Lu Ming was stronger than the sacred constellation, he was just a slightly stronger ant. He did not take it to heart.</p><p>“Although Lu Ming’s combat strength isn’t weak, compared to a prodigy like Wang Chen, there’s still a huge gap. It’s dangerous for him to stay here.”</p><p>In the valley, Gong Fei and Meng Jia had already finished recuperating and were looking outside with worried looks.</p><p>“Lu Ming looks very calm. He knows that Wang Chen is here, but he still dares to stay. He must be confident. We’ll see how things go. If things don’t look right, we’ll charge out together!”</p><p>Wen lezhang said.</p><p>“There’s still one more move. Holy star, is this all you’ve got? What a disappointment!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Ah, ah, how is that possible, how is that possible?”</p><p>Holy constellation roared in disbelief in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
