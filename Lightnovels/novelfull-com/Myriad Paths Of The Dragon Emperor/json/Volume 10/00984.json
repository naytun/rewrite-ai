It was extremely bright, competing with the sun in the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>However, this was only the beginning. After a few breaths, another sun appeared.</p><p>Then, one sun after another appeared in the sky, competing with the real sun.</p><p>In the end, a total of nine suns appeared. They were so bright that no one could open their eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A burly figure rushed out of the mountain peak and stood under the nine suns. He was like a sun god descending to the world, giving people an indescribable shock.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was ecstatic.</p><p>“Jiuyang, it’s Xia Jiuyang!”</p><p>Outside the yin and yang formation, the Masters of the Wang and Jiang families shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Wasn’t the Supreme Being of the nine suns only left with a wisp of his soul? But from the looks of it, he had clearly recovered his physical body, and his aura was powerful and unrivaled.</p><p>All the Supreme martial artists of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had extremely grave expressions.</p><p>Among them, there were many Supreme martial artists who had worked with the nine suns Supreme martial artist before and knew how terrifying he was.</p><p>The Supreme of nine suns used to be known as the number one Supreme in the eastern barren territory. Even someone as powerful as Yan kuangtu didn’t have this title, because Yan kuangtu had his own rivals, while the Supreme of nine suns had no rivals below the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It seemed that the nine suns Supreme had succeeded.</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others also looked happy. The nine suns Supreme Master had recovered, and their power was much stronger.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme martial artist alone was equivalent to several Supreme martial artists.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the nine suns trembled and slowly shrank, turning into nine light spots and entering the body of the nine suns Supreme Master.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of light, the nine suns Supreme appeared beside Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, you’ve recovered?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely excited.</p><p>haha, I’ve reformed my physical body. However, it’ll take some time for me to recover my peak cultivation and combat strength!</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s great, haha!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was overjoyed and laughed.</p><p>When the other elders of the talisman sect heard about this, they were also extremely excited. This was a boost to their morale. The nine yang Supreme master’s reputation was too great. He was invincible among Supremes below the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>This was a huge boost to the morale of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“Xia Jiuyang has really recovered!”</p><p>The Wang clan master and the others widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“Jiuyang, I didn’t expect you to be able to recover your physical body!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi also frowned slightly.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Di Yi, you didn’t expect this, did you? it’s all thanks to Lu Ming that I have the chance to recover. Moreover, good fortune and bad luck come together. After this disaster, I may be able to reach a higher level!”</p><p>Nine suns Supreme said as he stared at Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>His words were like a sudden clap of thunder, causing the Wang clan’s clan master, Bai Shijin, and the others to be greatly shocked.</p><p>The only difference was that the Wang clan master and the others were shocked, while Bai Shijin and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>The nine suns Paragon had already reached the Supreme level and had reached the peak. What did it mean to be able to reach the next level? Wouldn’t he be at the martial Royal realm?</p><p>Could the nine suns Supreme possibly break through to the martial Royal realm? This was too shocking.</p><p>It had been thousands of years since a new Martial Emperor had been born in the eastern wilderness.</p><p>A Martial Emperor could live for ten to twenty thousand years, but after so many years, how many martial emperors were there in the eastern barren territory? They could be counted with the fingers.</p><p>If the nine suns Supreme had really broken through to the martial Royal realm, the talisman Amulet sect would have the capital to fight against the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes were filled with amazing brilliance. He said, ” Jiuyang, you’ve indeed gained a blessing in disguise and obtained a great opportunity. You’ve wandered for decades as a remnant soul, which has improved your cultivation. At the same time, your new body and soul have a compelling spirituality. You do have the chance to take that step and become a Martial Emperor. You’re indeed the disciple I’ve chosen.</p><p>“All of this is thanks to you!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>haha, Jiuyang, even so, it’ll be difficult for you to cross it in ten years. After ten years, you and the yin and yang mountain will be turned into ashes. Even if you break through to the martial Royal realm, do you think you can compete with me? ”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi laughed, full of invincible confidence.</p><p>The hearts of Bai Shijin and the others sank.</p><p>Not to mention when the nine suns Supreme would break through. Even if he could break through, was he really a match for Martial Emperor Di Yi?</p><p>It had been 10000 years since Di Yi became a Martial Emperor. No one could say what realm he had reached.</p><p>I’ve said that the talisman sect will be destroyed. You won’t have any chance. Although the yin and yang formation is powerful, it’s not invincible!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s voice came out, and a blood-red light emitted from between his eyebrows.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The next moment, there was the sound of waves crashing. A sea of blood appeared in front of Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>It was a sea of blood.</p><p>Furthermore, the blood sea was expanding rapidly.</p><p>Ten miles, a hundred miles, a thousand miles, ten thousand miles …</p><p>In the end, it expanded to millions of miles wide, covering the entire area of Mount Liangyi.</p><p>The sea of blood covered the sky, causing the talisman Amulet sect to be completely dark. Not a single ray of sunlight could be seen.</p><p>“This is … Boundless blood sea, how was that possible? There really is such a heaven-defying treasure in the world!”</p><p>Du songjue cried out in shock.</p><p>Bai Shijin, Meng Chong, and the other experts who had heard of the name of the boundless blood sea also widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“Bai Shijin, what’s going on with this boundless blood sea? How come I’ve never heard of such a treasure?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu asked.</p><p>I don’t know either. I only read about it in the ancient records. It doesn’t exist in the divine wilderness continent. This boundless blood sea has a terrifying power, which is to break arrays. It can cover an array and corrode its Foundation, thus completely destroying the array. I didn’t expect Di Yi to have a treasure like this.</p><p>Bai Shijin’s face was extremely ugly.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s face darkened when he heard this.</p><p>I guess it’s a treasure that Martial Emperor Di Yi brought back from overseas. He has been planning to deal with the yin and yang mountain for a long time!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>the world is so big, the divine wilderness is but a drop in the ocean. I brought this back from overseas, and it is enough to break the array of your Mount Liangyi!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s voice was heard.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The blood sea rolled and covered the yin and yang formation. The blood-colored sea water seeped into the mountain along the border of the yin and yang mountain, destroying the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest even heard a sizzling sound.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Some of the talisman sect’s elders shouted anxiously.</p><p>there’s no need to panic. Although the boundless blood sea is strong, the yin and yang formation has its own natural power. Even the boundless blood sea can’t break the yin and yang formation in a short time!</p><p>Bai Shijin said, trying to comfort everyone.</p><p>Standing outside the yin and yang formation, Martial Emperor Di Yi looked at the rolling blood sea and ordered, ” the limitless blood sea can’t break the yin and yang formation in a short period of time. Leave a group of people here to guard this place and prevent the talisman Amulet sect from escaping. Also, guard the teleportation formations at all places!</p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artists received the order.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi’s body moved and disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
