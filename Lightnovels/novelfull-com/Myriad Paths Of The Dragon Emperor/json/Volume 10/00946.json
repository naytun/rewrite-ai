If he failed the first time and tried again, the danger would increase.</p><p>...</p><p>amazing, too amazing! No wonder there are two heaven and earth Jade essence here. It was prepared for the Twin forbidden spell!</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed and his heart was pounding.</p><p>Anyone would be tempted by such a heaven-defying secret technique.</p><p>it just so happens that I have two heaven and earth Jade essences. I’ll give one to senior Jiuyang, and I’ll keep the other one to practice the Twin forbidden spell. If I can’t succeed in one attempt, then I’ll give up.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Then, he carefully closed the metal box and put it away.</p><p>It was impossible to cultivate such a secret skill now. Other than the heaven and earth Jade essence, he needed other materials, especially those that could nurture the soul.</p><p>He could only cultivate it after the war of Providence was over.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at the book of Destiny!”</p><p>With a thought, the Book of Destiny appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that his luck value had reached more than three hundred thousand.</p><p>In other words, this trip to the sky Poison Island had increased his luck value by more than 200000.</p><p>This time, it was a truly great opportunity.</p><p>nine totem pillars appeared? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly narrowed. He realized that the notification from the Book of Destiny stated that nine totem pillars had appeared. There was one more pillar to go before he could open the ancient city of Providence.</p><p>it seems that a lot of time has really passed. The battle of Providence is probably ending soon!</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that he had stayed here for at least a few months.</p><p>“Time to go out!”</p><p>After keeping the items, Lu Ming looked around and made sure that there were no other items. He then strode outside.</p><p>When he walked out of the cave, the thick poisonous gas was still outside. Lu Ming released the devouring power to cover his entire body and resist the poisonous gas.</p><p>He then strode out.</p><p>After leaving the cave, Lu Ming’s footsteps became faster and faster. He traveled thousands of miles in the blink of an eye. After that, poisonous insects began to appear. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved greatly and his combat strength was much stronger than before. Naturally, he could pass through them easily. Along the way, he also found many spiritual herbs and picked them up.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the edge of the sky Poison Island.</p><p>On the surface of the lake, there was a thick green poisonous gas floating around. The poisonous gas would only dissipate once every three months. Clearly, it was not time yet.</p><p>no, I can’t wait any longer. If the battle of Kismet is in ten days or half a month, I’ll miss it if I stay here. If I rush out, the mountain and river diagram should be able to stop me, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and entered the mountain and river diagram. In the air, there was only one scroll of the mountain and river diagram floating.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the mountain and river diagram from within and flew towards the surface of the lake.</p><p>Instantly, the mountain and river diagram was surrounded by poisonous gas.</p><p>Fortunately, the mountain and river diagram’s materials were extraordinary and of a very high level. It successfully resisted the invasion of the poisonous gas. Very quickly, the mountain and river diagram crossed the lake’s surface and returned to the shore.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared from the mountain and river diagram and put it away.</p><p>phew, I’m finally out. Let’s go find Chi Xue and the others. Let’s see how long it’ll be before the battle of Providence ends. I wonder what happened during this time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and flew into the distance.</p><p>During this period, he tried to send messages to Bai chixue, Wen Zhongli and the others using the Jade talisman, but they could not get out.</p><p>It seemed that they were too far apart.</p><p>Lu Ming could only fly and search.</p><p>After flying for a day and covering a few million miles, Lu Ming did not encounter a single person.</p><p>Not only did he not encounter a single person, he didn’t even encounter the three-eyed God race.</p><p>“Strange, something’s not right. I’ve flown for millions of miles, it’s impossible that I didn’t encounter a single person!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He felt very strange.</p><p>He went back to where Bai chixue and the others had gathered, but there was no one there. Apparently, they had left a long time ago.</p><p>I don’t believe this. Let’s go take a look at the three-eyed God race’s Royal City and capture a few of them to ask about the situation!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming headed in the direction of the three-eyed God’s Royal City according to the map he had obtained from the three-eyed God.</p><p>The capital city of the three-eyed God race was at the center of this world. Lu Ming flew for an entire day before he neared the borders of the capital.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, there were two blood-red rays of light in front of them, shooting towards the North.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was overjoyed and was about to give chase, the two rays of light suddenly stopped and flew toward Lu Ming. The light dissipated and two young men appeared.</p><p>Two young men in blood-red robes with long sabers on their backs exuded a powerful and bloody saber intent.</p><p>“Could they be from the heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He stared at the two young men without saying a word.</p><p>haha, there’s still someone from the divine wilderness continent here. He actually dares to run around on his own. Just in time to kill him, and his fate points will belong to us!</p><p>A young man with a big mole on his chin looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>his luck value is yours. His storage ring is mine!</p><p>The other young man spoke as well, looking as if Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart suddenly trembled and his mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p>“They call us people from the divine wilderness continent? The people of the divine wilderness continent would never address them this way. Could it be that these two people were not from the divine wilderness continent? But how is that possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Since ancient times, the war for karmic luck had always been carried out on its own.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent’s five huge regions carried out their own activities. They had never done it together before. Furthermore, it was done by people from the other continents.</p><p>Now, why would someone from another continent appear?</p><p>It seemed that while Lu Ming was on the sky Poison Island, there had been some changes outside.</p><p>this kid isn’t speaking. Is he a mute? ”</p><p>The young man with the mole on his chin sneered.</p><p>“Who cares what he is, just kill him!”</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>“Where are you guys from?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>hehe, so you’re not a mute. Death is near, so there’s no harm in telling you. We’re from the bloodblade continent. Die, kid!</p><p>The young man with the mole sneered. The saber intent on his body soared. A blood-red saber energy, thousands of meters long, slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>These two youths had extremely powerful auras and had reached the fifth level spirit embryo realm. If they were placed before Lu Ming entered the sky Poison Island, they would be ranked in the 40th or 50th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand slightly and the blood-colored astral saber collapsed. The two young men’s expressions changed.</p><p>The two young men’s eyes turned serious when they saw that the man was able to shatter the mole-faced young man’s saber energy so easily.</p><p>“The bloodblade continent? Why are you here? Also, where are the divine wilderness continent’s elites?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His eyes turned cold and he asked a few questions.</p><p>“Kid, go to hell and ask!”</p><p>The mole-faced young man shouted coldly as his killing intent exploded. His blood Qi soared into the sky and turned into a huge saber.</p><p>This cultivation technique was similar to the cultivation technique of the seventh Blood Sword of the heavenly corpse sect, but the cultivation technique of the people of the bloodblade continent was purer.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other young man shouted coldly as his saber aura expanded. The blood-red saber aura actually contained the aura of fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
