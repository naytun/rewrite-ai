It was Blood Sword nine.</p><p>“Vajra, go and help!” Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Alright, Blood Sword nine, your opponent is me!”</p><p>King Kong roared and pounced at Blood Sword nine. They immediately fought.</p><p>“King Kong, are you crazy? our opponent is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Blood Sword nine roared.</p><p>“You dare to fight with my boss? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>King Kong roared and clawed out continuously, covering Blood Sword nine. No matter how Blood Sword Nine’s sword light flickered, he couldn’t break through.</p><p>Blood Sword seven, Blood Sword nine, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>The demon race’s proud Son of Heaven, Vajra, actually called Lu Ming ‘boss’ and sided with him. What was going on?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into the nine Dragons and clawed at Blood Sword seven.</p><p>The seventh sanguine sword’s body flashed with a blood-red light. The blood-red golden light was extremely sharp as it slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them fought, and the rumbles continued.</p><p>Figures flickered around him. Lu Ming saw brother Litian and another demon race prodigy, the man in green.</p><p>“King Kong, what’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>The green-robed young man of the demon clan rushed toward King Kong.</p><p>“What do you mean? Get lost!”</p><p>The Vajra roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain and river diagram flew out of Lu Ming’s glabella and wrapped around the seventh Blood Sword.</p><p>The seventh sanguine sword was shocked. He instinctively felt that the painting was very dangerous. He retreated quickly and slashed out sword light to split the mountain and river painting.</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies, and the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst out toward the seventh Blood Sword, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming surrounded himself with the mountain and river diagram to protect his vital points. Then, he launched a violent attack on the seventh sanguine sword, ignoring his defense.</p><p>The seventh Blood Sword fought back, but the mountain and river diagram didn’t move at all when the sword light hit it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Blood Sword seven was shocked and was hit by the nine Dragons ‘claws. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and quickly retreated.</p><p>He did not dare to stay any longer. His figure flashed and he rushed to where blood Sword nine was and met up with him. Lu Ming stepped into the void and came to King Kong’s side. The two sides were in a confrontation.</p><p>Litian’s brother stood in the distance and did not make a move.</p><p>He had seen with his own eyes that Lu Ming had killed the little demon Lord and restrained the Vajra. In his eyes, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable.</p><p>“King Kong, how dare you betray the demon race and help Lu Ming? do you want to die?”</p><p>The green-robed demon youth shouted coldly.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? I’m all alone in the demon race. What’s there to be afraid of? I’m going to join Lu Ming’s side now. What’s wrong with that?”</p><p>King Kong opened his mouth and looked at the young man in green with disdain.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The green-robed youth’s face turned ashen.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly roared.</p><p>Not far away, a Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect was about to kill a talisman sect disciple who was flying over.</p><p>A long spear appeared and instantly crossed the void, killing the Paragon of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Whoever dares to kill the disciples of my Talisman Amulet sect will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he swept his gaze across the audience.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Blood Sword nine shouted.</p><p>“Oh, really? Let’s see who will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward Blood Sword nine.</p><p>Sanguine sword nine launched an explosive attack, but just like sanguine sword seven, Lu Ming did not care about defense at all. He launched a fierce attack, causing sanguine sword nine to vomit blood. He could only turn around and escape.</p><p>Blood Sword seven and blood Sword Nine’s expressions were ugly. They did not dare to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>The green-robed young man from the demon clan was extremely fearful and kept his distance from Lu Ming.</p><p>“If any of you want to die, I don’t mind sending you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept across the entire scene. The Supreme talents of the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace, heavenly corpse sect, and heavenly demon Valley stayed far away. They were extremely afraid. No one dared to stop the talisman sect’s disciples.</p><p>Very soon, the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples gathered around Lu Ming.</p><p>There were five to six people less than before. It was obvious that these five to six people had already fallen. This made Lu Ming’s eyes turn gloomy. He pondered how to keep all the geniuses from the three parties.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Bai chixue’s inheritance seemed to have reached a critical moment. The energy fluctuations from her body were getting stronger and stronger, and the golden light spread far and wide.</p><p>From a distance, they could see that the surroundings of the palace were originally filled with great arrays. At this time, those great arrays were glowing and collapsing one by one.</p><p>This place had become an ordinary land, and the formation had disappeared.</p><p>All around, everyone was watching from afar.</p><p>The people from the Empyrean divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley were very unwilling and wanted to cause trouble. However, with Lu Ming eyeing them like a tiger watching its prey and the Vajra, they did not dare to make a move.</p><p>After a while, the energy fluctuation on Bai chixue’s body decreased and the golden light faded away.</p><p>When the golden light was gone, Bai chixue opened her eyes.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Bai chixue.</p><p>Bai chixue seemed to know nothing. She was a little confused. She looked around and then stood up as if she had remembered something.</p><p>“Chi Xue, how is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and came to Bai chixue’s side.</p><p>“Fortunately, I seem to have obtained the inheritance of a senior!”</p><p>Bai chixue blinked her eyes and looked a little confused. Lu Ming was speechless. Bai chixue had obtained the inheritance of a ninth-level Alchemist. Did she not know about it?</p><p>there seems to be a lot of new things in my head that I need to digest!</p><p>Bai chixue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was true. It was just like when he first received the legacy from Lian Cang. It was impossible to increase his combat strength so quickly. He needed time to understand it. It would be very helpful for his future cultivation.</p><p>The other disciples of the talisman sect all looked at Bai chixue with envy.</p><p>With the inheritance of a ninth-level Alchemist, Bai chixue was destined to rise in the future.</p><p>As for the other three forces, their eyes were filled with killing intent. It was not a good thing for the other three forces that Bai chixue had received the inheritance of the Emperor. In the future, when she rose to power, she was destined to be on the opposite side of the three forces.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent explosion came from the distance.</p><p>The voice came from outside the palace.</p><p>The earth rumbled as if ten thousand horses were galloping. Even the void was shaking violently.</p><p>Then, powerful auras shot up into the sky like smoke.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. It was the people from the three forces of the Emperor heaven divine Palace who had stayed outside the formation. Now that the formation had collapsed, there was naturally no one who could stop them.</p><p>“Three-eyed God race! It’s the three-eyed God race!”</p><p>After those people flew over, their faces were filled with panic.</p><p>Everyone else’s faces changed as well. They then saw that on the ground and in the air, there were many tall and burly three-eyed gods riding on a huge demonic beast.</p><p>These demonic beasts were similar to the three-eyed God race. Their bodies were covered in scales and they had two long horns like water buffaloes.</p><p>&Nbsp; the three-eyed God race had completely surrounded them.</p><p>these three-eyed gods have been eyeing this ruin for a long time. They probably want to surround us and kill us. Once the formation collapses, they’ll charge out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn. He could sense many powerful auras among the three-eyed God race.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
