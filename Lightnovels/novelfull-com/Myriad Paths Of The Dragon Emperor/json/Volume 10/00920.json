Don’t worry. I’ll look after her. Lu Ming won’t have a chance! Ro li nodded.</p><p>...</p><p>“Zongzi, you’re so powerful!”</p><p>At the side, the talisman sect’s disciples cast Lu Ming looks of admiration.</p><p>Some of them had already been trying to break the array for several days and knew how difficult it was to break it. In the past few days, many talisman puppet sect disciples had been killed by the array.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming came, he had only observed for a short while and he had already broken a few large arrays.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming’s understanding of formations far surpassed theirs.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to watch. This time, he spent even less time. He waved his fingers and another array collapsed in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the formations that appeared in this world during the battle of Providence were not particularly advanced, difficult, or beyond their abilities.</p><p>It was as if he was doing this on purpose to give them a chance to gain experience.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with curiosity about the battle of Providence. He had a feeling that there was a pair of invisible hands behind the scenes that were controlling everything.</p><p>He shook his head in his heart. These things were not something he could think about now. It was useless even if he thought about it.</p><p>It was said that the battle of Providence was taking place in the other continents overseas. To be able to control the endless mainland to participate in the battle of Providence … What was the use of thinking about such an extraordinary ability?</p><p>Even a martial Royal realm expert would train his sect’s geniuses obediently in order to obtain the light from Providence.</p><p>Don’t those martial emperors want to find out the secret behind it? Of course they wanted to, but they just didn’t have the ability to.</p><p>Lu Ming cast aside the distracting thoughts in his mind and continued to crack the array.</p><p>His speed of breaking the formation was very fast. As he broke the formation, he walked in. In just a day’s time, they had advanced 3000 meters.</p><p>The little demon Lord and the rest followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Their eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>This ruin was filled with so many formations. It must be extraordinary. The treasures inside must be extraordinary. If he could get it, it would be a great opportunity. Moreover, he would probably have a lot of luck value.</p><p>They all revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>However, after that, Lu Ming’s speed of breaking the array slowed down. The deeper he went, the more complicated the array was and the harder it was to crack.</p><p>It took them two days to advance another three thousand meters.</p><p>He was still four thousand meters away from the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a total of five days on the last four thousand meters.</p><p>In total, Lu Ming had been breaking the array for eight days.</p><p>At this time, they were only about a hundred meters away from the palace.</p><p>But here, they stopped.</p><p>In front of him, the formation glowed. There were flames, ice, lightning, poison gas, and so on that flickered continuously, blocking his line of sight. He couldn’t see what was ahead at all.</p><p>Lu Ming had been standing there for three hours.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? Why aren’t you breaking the formation?”</p><p>The little demon Lord berated.</p><p>“I can’t break the formation here!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“You can’t break it?”</p><p>The little demon Lord and the others were stunned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better think of a way to crack it. Otherwise, none of you from the talisman Amulet sect will be able to leave this place. You’ll all die Here!”</p><p>The little demon Lord said coldly.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the little demon Lord and suddenly berated him.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? You bastard, what did you say?”</p><p>The little demon Lord roared.</p><p>Lu Ming actually called him an idiot? He was furious.</p><p>“What are you if not an idiot? I said I can’t break it, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go in. In the Dao of formations, where there is death, there is life. As long as you find a way out, there is no need to break it, you can go straight. You don’t even know this common sense, if you’re not an idiot, what are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The little demon Lord’s face turned red and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>If not for the fact that he needed Lu Ming now, he would have killed him with one palm.</p><p>“Bastard, just you wait. Once we enter the palace, I’ll kill all of these symbol puppet sect disciples and enjoy this woman in front of you!”</p><p>The little demon Lord roared in his heart, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve been watching for so long. Have you found a way out?”</p><p>Brother Litian asked.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed forward.</p><p>Brother Litian’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you kidding me?”</p><p>Brother Litian said with a dark expression.</p><p>The direction that Lu Ming was pointing at was a sea of fire. The terrifying flames were burning. One look at it and it was terrifying.</p><p>that’s the way out. If you don’t believe me, you can send someone first. You’ll know once you try!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think we’re stupid? Let your Talisman Amulet sect go first!”</p><p>The little demon Lord shouted coldly.</p><p>“Not bad! Let your Talisman Amulet sect go first!”</p><p>The seventh sanguine sword also said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>“You guys go first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>The talisman sect’s disciples looked at each other and saw the flames in front of them. Their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Let’s go, zongzi won’t harm us!”</p><p>Hai Fei took the lead and walked forward, followed by Liu Guang. The rest of the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples followed behind and stepped into the sea of fire. The moment they stepped into the sea of fire, the sea of fire distorted and the figures of the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples disappeared.</p><p>“It’s really a way out. Hurry up and follow them. Don’t let those Talisman Amulet sect disciples escape!”</p><p>The little demon Lord hurriedly ordered.</p><p>A few geniuses of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace led more than ten men of sacrifice and rushed into the sea of fire.</p><p>However, as soon as they rushed into the sea of fire, they let out shrill screams and were burned to ashes in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The power of that flame was incomparably terrifying.</p><p>“What’s going on? Damn it, Lu Ming, you’re cheating. You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The little demon Lord immediately roared.</p><p>Brother Litian, the seventh sanguine sword, and the others also exuded a terrifying killing intent that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>What do you mean I cheated? you’re just too impatient. The formations here are overlapping and constantly changing. The path of survival is also constantly changing. It was a path of survival just now, but now it’s a path of death. It’s normal!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier!”</p><p>The little demon Lord roared.</p><p>“You didn’t ask me. Why should I say it? and didn’t I ask your people to go first? I was planning to send a batch of your people in first, and after the path of survival changes, find another path of survival, and then send another batch in.”</p><p>“You were the one who insisted on letting the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples leave first. Then, before I could even say anything, your people rushed forward. Who can you blame?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and looked at the little demon Lord in disdain.</p><p>The little demon Lord trembled with anger.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming, can you find a new way to survive?”</p><p>Brother Li Tian frowned.</p><p>At the same time, they paid more attention to Bai chixue.</p><p>Now, the talisman sect only had Bai chixue in their hands.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to watch.</p><p>A moment later, he pointed at a place full of lightning and said, ” that’s the way out. Let’s set off from there!</p><p>“You guys go first!”</p><p>The little demon Lord pointed at a few men of sacrifice.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then leave a little more, don’t leave in groups. The more this formation operates, the more changes it will have. After a while, even I won’t be able to break it.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
