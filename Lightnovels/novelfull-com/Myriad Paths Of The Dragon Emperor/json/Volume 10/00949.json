BOOM!</p><p>There were two loud bangs. Only the blood-haired young man and the other two most powerful people could compete with Lu Ming. However, they were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually kill the other experts while fighting the two of them. His combat strength was terrifyingly strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber Qi soared to the sky, and the remaining people all unleashed their bloodlines.</p><p>They were all blood-red Warblade bloodlines, but their levels were different.</p><p>There were six golden chakras on the blades of the red-haired young man and the other young man.</p><p>Divine level rank 6 bloodline.</p><p>As for the remaining few, they all had fifth level divine level bloodlines.</p><p>The rest of the people used bloodline fusion at the same time, turning into blood-red sabers with shocking saber intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>Huan Zhen stepped into the air. With every step, runes filled the air.</p><p>“No need. Help me hold the line and prevent anyone from escaping!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This made Huan Zhen stunned. Was Lu Ming going to make everyone from the bloodblade continent stay here?</p><p>Isn’t he too confident?</p><p>The other talisman sect members looked at each other in shock and anticipation.</p><p>“Such big words, watch how I kill you!”</p><p>One of the sabers let out a furious roar and expanded to a thousand meters in size, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and merged with the nine Dragon bloodline. The nine Dragon bloodline roared and its nine claws stepped out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Violent energy blasted out. Other than the two divine level six blood sabers, the other blood sabers all exploded and turned back into human form. They fell to the ground and were no longer alive.</p><p>The two divine level level six blood sabers were also trembling non-stop. Their saber Qi collapsed and they were sent flying.</p><p>The two of them were at the seventh level spirit embryo realm, the same level as Lu Ming. How could they be his match?</p><p>Lu Ming had never met an opponent of the same level.</p><p>“Not good, he’s too strong. Let’s go, split up!”</p><p>The blood-haired young man’s shocked voice came from one of the blood-red blades. Lu Ming’s performance had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two blood-red blades fled in two different directions.</p><p>“Where should we go?”</p><p>In one of the directions, a formation appeared, and an illusory figure suddenly appeared there, blocking a blood-red saber.</p><p>“Dodge!”</p><p>A voice came from the blood saber and the saber Light slashed at Huan Zhen.</p><p>Huan Zhen’s Silver hair danced in the wind and his eyes glowed with silver light. Around him, formations appeared and turned into silver swords that slashed at bloody blade.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling continued, and the blood-red saber could not break through at all.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. His dragon claws stepped in the air and caught up with the other blood saber.</p><p>The blood-red saber was transformed from the blood-haired young man.</p><p>The nine Dragons clawed at the blood saber.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn’t escape, the bloody blade let out an angry roar, and its blade Qi rose sharply, slashing at the nine Dragons.</p><p>However, under the nine Dragons ‘all-conquering dragon claws, they were all in vain, and the saber Qi was destroyed.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The nine dragon claws grabbed the blood-red saber one after another and pulled with all their might. The blood-red saber shattered into pieces with a bang, and the figure of the red-haired young man reappeared in the air.</p><p>At this moment, his face was full of panic, and his eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies and charged at him.</p><p>“Even if you can kill me, I won’t let you have an easy time!”</p><p>The red-haired young man had a ferocious look on his face. He pounced on Lu Ming without fear of death.</p><p>It was a pity that there was a huge gap between his combat strength and Lu Ming’s. It was not something that could be made up for by fearlessness. After a few moves, he was torn apart by Lu Ming and died on the spot.</p><p>Then, the Dragon twisted its body and pounced at the last youth from the bloodblade continent.</p><p>The result was destined. Lu Ming and Huan Zhen were together and the young man was killed in a few moves.</p><p>Not far away, the talisman sect’s disciples were completely silent. Their eyes were wide open and filled with shock.</p><p>The group of powerful bloodblade continent’s young men who had followed Lu Ming here were killed in an instant.</p><p>Among them, two of them were comparable to the top ten on the list of top 1000 talents. Such people were also killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>This was simply unbelievable. It made them feel like they were in a dream.</p><p>The talisman sect disciples who had been with Lu Ming were still in a better state. However, those who had not seen Lu Ming since the battle of Providence were even more shocked.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence, although Lu Ming was strong, there was still a huge gap between him and the top ten on the list of top 1000 talents. Not many people thought that Lu Ming could compete with such a figure. First, Lu Ming could kill such a figure.</p><p>After the shock, it was ecstasy.</p><p>Lu Ming was the candidate of the talisman sect. The stronger he was, the stronger the talisman sect would be. Naturally, they would be happy.</p><p>Devouring power burst out of the mouths of the nine Dragon bloodline cultivators, devouring all the vital essence and blood essence of the bloodblade continent cultivators.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming no longer had to worry about using the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>After devouring, Lu Ming transformed back into his human form.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you very much for this!”</p><p>Huan Zhen cupped his fists.</p><p>His eyes were filled with surprise. Lu Ming’s progress was too great.</p><p>Truth be told, when he first met Lu Ming, although Huan Zhen was very polite, that was just his personality. He did not expect Lu Ming to reach this level and did not treat Lu Ming as a prodigy of his level.</p><p>But now, not only had Lu Ming achieved it, but his ability had probably surpassed him.</p><p>“No need to thank me. Fortunately, I’m not late!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where have you been all this time? Why don’t I see him?”</p><p>The other disciples of the talisman Amulet sect also surrounded him. Bai chixue glared at Lu Ming, her eyes filled with joy and resentment.</p><p>that’s right, Lu Ming. Our Little Scarlet Snow has been very worried about you during this period of time. She misses you so much that she doesn’t even have the appetite to eat or drink. Haha!</p><p>On the side, Wen zhishi teased.</p><p>“Senior brother Wen, you … Nonsense, what does his life or death have to do with me?”</p><p>Bai chixue stomped her feet and her face turned red.</p><p>“Haha, you’re shy!”</p><p>Wen Zhongli laughed out loud.</p><p>On the side, the others also laughed. Having escaped death, everyone was very relaxed.</p><p>Bai chixue’s face and neck turned even redder. She did not dare to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Looking at Bai chixue’s shy expression, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>this girl, don’t tell me she really likes me. It seems that I can’t tease her in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>“What’s going on with the people of the bloodblade continent? Why was everyone attacked by the people of the bloodblade continent? Also, how much longer is there until the battle of Kismet ends in a year?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly changed the topic and asked.</p><p>As he spoke, he refined the energy that he had devoured.</p><p>Most of the youths from the bloodblade continent cultivated either the blood or blade concepts, which were of no use to him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s only five days left until the one-year battle of Providence!”</p><p>Huan Zhen said.</p><p>five days! I’ve actually stayed on the sky Poison Island for more than five months!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
