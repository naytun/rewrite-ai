A golden beam of light shot out from his eyes, piercing towards Lu Ming like a sharp sword.</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and dispersed the light beam.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He realized that these three-eyed gods were very powerful. They were generally stronger than humans, and even comparable to some human geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe that the other party was a genius of the three-eyed God race. From the looks of it, he was just an ordinary three-eyed God.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming crushed the beam of light, stepped forward, and activated the prison suppressing heavenly art. He slammed his palm onto the three-eyed celestial’s body.</p><p>A large part of the three-eyed God’s body caved in, and his muscular body was sent flying for more than a thousand meters, devoid of any life.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>When the remaining three three-eyed gods saw that Lu Ming had killed their team leader with a single move, they immediately knew that they had encountered an opponent that they could not defeat. They shouted in anger and fled in different directions.</p><p>“You want to leave? Stay here!”</p><p>With a single nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, he caught up to another ninth level spiritual ocean tier expert in the blink of an eye and struck down with his palm. This time, Lu Ming didn’t kill him. He only severely injured the three-eyed God before he chased after the other two.</p><p>After cultivating in the ferocious beast secret realm for several months, Lu Ming had improved in all aspects. He had even cultivated the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to the sixth step, and its power was comparable to the peak of a high-grade demigod martial technique. His speed was extremely fast, and it did not take long for him to injure the remaining two three-eyed gods.</p><p>&Nbsp; he threw the three three-eyed God race members together.</p><p>“Now, what do I ask you? What are you going to answer? Do you understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the three three-eyed gods.</p><p>don’t even think about it, human. If you want to kill, just kill. Don’t expect me to say anything!</p><p>One of the three-eyed gods roared.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as the nine Dragons bloodline appeared. He opened his mouth and devouring power burst forth, enveloping the three-eyed God. The three-eyed God immediately wailed in pain before his body rapidly withered and turned into a dried corpse.</p><p>All the essence was devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>&Nbsp; seeing this terrifying sight, the two remaining three-eyed gods began to tremble in fear.</p><p>“What about you guys?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the two remaining three-eyed gods.</p><p>“Speak, I’ll speak. I’ll tell you anything you ask!”</p><p>One of them shouted.</p><p>“I’ll also say it!” The other one quickly nodded.</p><p>okay, let me ask you, what is this place? is it in the heaven realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Heaven realm? I don’t know. I was born here, and according to the clan’s legend, we’ve been living here for countless years!”</p><p>One of the three-eyed gods said.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>I’ve read about it in an ancient book of my clan. The ancient book recorded that our ancestors didn’t seem to have lived here in the beginning. They seemed to have been captured by someone and brought to this place. Later on, they couldn’t get out, so they lived here and reproduced our clan!</p><p>The other three-eyed God was shocked when he saw Lu Ming frowning. He answered in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Your ancestor was captured and brought here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. After that, I don’t know when it started, but every 20 years, you human youths would come and hunt down my kind. After a while, all of you would disappear!</p><p>A three-eyed race member said.</p><p>“Every twenty years, a young human will arrive. That should be the battle of Providence. However, the battle of Providence takes place in a different region each time. Those who come and go should be people from other regions, or even people from other continents beyond the sea.”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Is there anything special around here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>yes, there are some strange places. Some places are very dangerous, and my clan doesn’t dare to enter. Some places, once my clan enters, we will be killed!</p><p>The three-eyed God replied.</p><p>“Do you have a map?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, there’s a map in our Captain’s Storage ring! Now that we’ve said everything we need to say, can you let us go?”</p><p>One of the three-eyed gods asked carefully.</p><p>“Let you go? When did I say I would let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. With a wave of his hand, two spearlights shot out and killed two three-eyed gods.</p><p>&Nbsp; he then controlled his nine Dragon bloodline to devour the three-eyed God’s blood essence.</p><p>Then, eleven storage rings appeared in his hand.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, a Jade book flew out of Lu Ming’s glabella. It was the Book of Destiny, and some words appeared on it.</p><p>You have killed a three-eyed God and obtained 313 luck points.</p><p>Lu Ming’s total luck value had become three hundred and sixteen points.</p><p>killing a three-eyed God can actually give me fate value? and in such a huge amount? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He had obtained three level 6 spiritual herbs, but he had only obtained two or three luck points. He didn’t think that killing 11 three-eyed gods would give him so many luck points.</p><p>Then, his figure flickered and he left.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, refining his blood essence and energy.</p><p>The three-eyed God race cultivated the will of heaven and earth as well. The light that shot out from their third eye was condensed from the will of heaven and earth and an energy that was different from true essence.</p><p>Some of the eleven three-eyed gods had comprehended the intent of Thunder and the intent of fire. A part of the heaven and earth intent runes had been integrated into Lu Ming’s intent runes, and Lu Ming’s mastery of the intent of Thunder and fire had improved.</p><p>the Thunder and fire intents have already reached the limit of the second level completion, and I’m only one step away from the third level intent. The wind intent is also about the same. As for the earth intent, it hasn’t reached the peak of the second level completion yet, causing my current cultivation to only reach the peak of the eighth level spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>His current cultivation was precisely at the peak eighth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>After refining it, Lu Ming took out the storage rings he had obtained from the three-eyed God and looked through them one by one.</p><p>There were all sorts of things in the storage ring. Lu Ming kept them all. He found a map in one of the storage rings and opened it to take a look.</p><p>within a million miles, there are several strange places. I should go and take a look at these places. First, I should go to the demon tree Canyon, which is the closest to this place!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a while and made a decision.</p><p>The valley of the demonic trees was tens of thousands of miles away and was the closest.</p><p>After keeping the map, Lu Ming rose into the air and flew towards the demon tree Canyon.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the demon tree Canyon.</p><p>In front of them was a huge Valley filled with mist.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s moving figure suddenly stopped.</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, he saw a group of figures.</p><p>They were all young people from the outside world. Some were from the heavenly corpse sect, some were from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and some were even from the demon clan of the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>The three parties stopped at the entrance of the valley and seemed to be looking inside.</p><p>Upon hearing the commotion, everyone turned around and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming! It’s you?”</p><p>A cold shout rang out.</p><p>“Di Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
