I obtained two heaven and earth Jade essence in the battle of Providence!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled slightly. They could not help but envy Lu Ming’s heaven-defying opportunity to obtain two heaven and earth Jade essences.</p><p>However, they were still puzzled. What did this have to do with Lu Ming heading to the central continent?</p><p>seniors, I’ve also obtained a secret technique in the battle of Providence. It’s called the Twin forbidden spell …</p><p>Lu Ming then explained the Twin forbidden spell.</p><p>“Heavens, there’s such a secret technique?”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>This secret skill was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>He was actually able to split his soul into two and create a clone that was equivalent to himself. The clone had the exact same aura and could cultivate on its own. This was simply a heaven-defying secret technique.</p><p>I want to cultivate a second body and let it stay in the talisman Amulet sect. The second body’s aura will be exactly the same as mine, which is like another me. This way, I can firmly attract the attention of Di Yi and Martial Emperor here. He will think that I’m always in the talisman Amulet sect. In this way, my main body can go to the central continent and explore.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed his plan.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others muttered to themselves.</p><p>This was indeed a good idea.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what other materials do you need to cultivate the Twin forbidden spell?”</p><p>Bai Shijin asked.</p><p>the most important things are the elixir of life and the heaven and earth Jade essence. I already have these, but I still need some other materials!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming told him about some other materials.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we can gather all the materials you mentioned, but we might not have many treasures that can repair souls.”</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>To practice the Twin forbidden scroll, one’s soul had to be split into two, which would undoubtedly cause great damage to the soul. After successfully practicing it, one would need a treasure to restore the soul, which would restore both the main body and the secondary body to their peak state. This was absolutely necessary, otherwise, it would have a great impact on the future practice.</p><p>haha, treasures to recover the soul. You don’t have to worry about that. My master and I have been to many secret places and obtained many treasures to recover the soul. We still have a lot of them now!</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed and a storage ring appeared in his hand. He handed it to Lu Ming and said,”There are quite a few soul concentrating stones in here, do you think it’s enough?”</p><p>Over the past year, Yan kuangtu had gathered the soul power for the nine suns Supreme and had found many treasures to recover his soul.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the ring with his mind and found that there were hundreds of black stones in the storage ring that exuded a mysterious aura. They were the legendary soul-consolidating stones.</p><p>“Enough, enough!” Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll gather the other materials and let Lu Ming cultivate the second body as soon as possible!”</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>Du songjue and the others also revealed hopeful expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was heaven-defying and he had the bloodline of the nine Dragons. It was indeed a waste for him to stay in the talisman Amulet sect. If he were to risk his life and cultivate outside, he might be able to create a miracle.</p><p>Moreover, even if he could not create a miracle and reach the level where he could fight against Di Yi, Lu Ming’s survival was still a hope. Even if the talisman Amulet sect was destroyed, Lu Ming could avenge it in the future and even rebuild it.</p><p>They also understood why Lu Ming asked the elders to go out. This matter could not be spread. It could not be known to Martial Emperor Di Yi. Otherwise, it would be a waste of effort.</p><p>……</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged in an underground cave in the talisman sect.</p><p>He activated the Twin forbidden spell. More than ten materials turned into a ball of liquid in his hands and covered the heaven and earth Jade essence.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands kept forming wonderful hand seals. Beams of light entered the heaven and earth Jade essence. The heaven and earth Jade essence glowed and fused with the materials. Its shape actually began to change slowly.</p><p>Originally, although the heaven and earth Jade essence had taken the form of a human, it only had a vague human shape. Its facial features were very vague. However, at this moment, the heaven and earth Jade Essence’s facial features began to become clear. Its entire body began to change from top to bottom, and it began to transform into a body of flesh and blood.</p><p>His internal organs, meridians, bones, and blood began to transform and appear as Lu Ming kept forming hand seals.</p><p>“Water of life!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out the elixir of life and poured over half a kilogram of it onto the heaven and earth Jade essence. The heaven and earth Jade essence began to emit an aura of life.</p><p>“It’s time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The next step was the most crucial one. He would split his soul and merge it with the heaven and earth Jade essence to create a second body.</p><p>This step was very dangerous and difficult. If one was not careful, it would damage one’s soul and even fail the cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the Twin forbidden spell and his body glowed. In the end, a ball of light and shadow emerged. It was very blurry but one could barely see that it looked exactly like Lu Ming. This was Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and formed a seal.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming’s soul started to tremble and slowly split apart from the middle.</p><p>Immediately, an unimaginable pain drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot and he let out a beast-like roar.</p><p>It was too painful. It was too painful. This kind of pain was unimaginable. It was a hundred times, no, a thousand times more painful than the pain on the body.</p><p>Those whose minds were not strong enough could collapse at this step and fail.</p><p>This was the pain of the soul splitting, and it came directly from the soul.</p><p>“This little pain is nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. He concentrated on his heart and continued to operate the Twin forbidden spell.</p><p>The endless pain drowned Lu Ming, but he endured it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul was slowly splitting apart. The process was very slow and Lu Ming was suffering every moment.</p><p>This kind of suffering continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, his soul completely split. The split soul turned into a ball of light and entered the heaven and earth Jade essence.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming felt his mind go blank. His eyes were unfocused and he was extremely weak.</p><p>“No, hold on, hold on, I’m still cultivating the Twin forbidden spell!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He finally came to his senses and continued to circulate the Twin forbidden spell.</p><p>The Twin forbidden art was indeed a forbidden art. It was extremely dangerous to cultivate it. Every step was filled with danger. If one made a mistake, not only would the cultivation fail, but one’s body would also suffer unimaginable injuries.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming managed to withstand it.</p><p>“Mind fire, separate into the clone!”</p><p>In Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the mental energy fire was slowly separated from his soul.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to completely refine the second body into an inscribed body.</p><p>It was too energy-consuming for one person to cultivate two.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming often felt that he did not have enough energy. It was difficult to cultivate both martial arts and the path of inscription at the same time. He would always fall behind in one of them.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been focusing on martial arts and had fallen behind on the Dao of inscription. His progress was very slow.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming planned to take this opportunity to separate the Dao of inscription. He would let the secondary body focus on the Dao of inscription, while the main body would focus on the martial arts.</p><p>The second body, without any distracting thoughts, would cultivate the Dao of inscription, and its speed would definitely be terrifying.</p><p>The main body, on the other hand, would focus on cultivating martial arts. This was a reasonable combination.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
