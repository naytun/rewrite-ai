Don’t worry, with us here, he won’t dare to play any tricks!</p><p>...</p><p>The young demonic Lord pointed at some of the paragons. The seventh Blood Sword, the paragons of the heavenly demon Valley, and the others had also arranged for a group of people to rush in according to the path Lu Ming had pointed.</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as those people rushed into the lightning area, their figures flickered and they disappeared one after another.</p><p>Only then did brother Litian and the others look a little better.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to watch and look for a way out.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming pointed to an area covered with ice and said, ” “Let’s go through this road!”</p><p>However, the little demonic Lord, brother Litian, and the seventh sanguine sword did not move.</p><p>These most powerful geniuses did not trust Lu Ming. If what Lu Ming said was false, wouldn’t they die an unjust death if they went in? Although they had Bai chixue with them, they had to be very careful when it came to their own lives.</p><p>“I think it would be best if we go in together!”</p><p>The little demon Lord looked at Lu Ming and pushed Bai chixue forward slowly.</p><p>Brother Litian and the rest nodded. That was for the best. If there was a trap, Lu Ming and Bai chixue would be in danger.</p><p>that’s for the best. You and Chi Xue go first, I’ll walk in the middle. You guys can rest assured this way!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps to the side, seemingly wanting to make way.</p><p>“Good! Lu Ming, you’d better not play any tricks. Otherwise, both of you will lose your lives!”</p><p>The little demon Lord said coldly. He held Bai chixue’s shoulder and walked forward.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there without moving. The little demon Lord was relieved and walked toward the ice area.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, the ground glowed, and a formation appeared out of nowhere. A few sharp sword Qi stabbed toward the little demon Lord’s forehead, fast as lightning.</p><p>The little demon Lord’s heart had just relaxed when he didn’t expect such a move. Subconsciously, he let go and retreated to protect himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved. His body was like a stream of light as he rushed toward the little demon Lord. A terrifying fist force bombarded the little demon Lord like a storm.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared angrily and slashed out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The little demonic Lord’s figure retreated repeatedly.</p><p>“Damn it, block the exit!”</p><p>Brother Litian, Blood Sword seven, Blood Sword nine, and the elites of the sky demon Valley all roared in anger. One of the elites of the sky demon Valley was the fastest and was the closest to the ice region. His figure flashed and he appeared at the entrance of the ice region to prevent Lu Ming from entering.</p><p>The rest of the people made their moves and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Brother Litian, Blood Sword seven, Blood Sword nine, and the sky demon Valley’s demon race prodigy were all at the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Especially brother Litian and the seventh sanguine sword, who had reached the peak of the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm. With all of them joining forces, their power was terrifying, as if they were going to crush Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not hesitate to release five bursts of dragon power.</p><p>His body was filled with power.</p><p>“Chi Xue, go to the poisonous area!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Bai chixue and pushed her into the poisonous zone.</p><p>In front of the toxic area, no one stopped him.</p><p>Lu Ming was lying when he said that the icy area was the way out. In fact, the poisonous area was the way out. His purpose was to distract the other party’s attention.</p><p>Bai chixue’s figure disappeared into the poisonous zone. Nobody could stop her.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Brother Litian and the others knew that they had been tricked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As he pushed Bai chixue away, Lu Ming threw out a few punches in a row to block brother Litian and the others, buying time and waiting for the escape route to change.</p><p>Everyone exchanged blows, and the terrifying light drowned Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as he retreated.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, stop him!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the truth. He did not dare to rush into the poisonous zone now. Who knew if there would be any changes to the way out? he could only capture Lu Ming and ask him to lead the way.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and a formation appeared. He then punched out with both fists, sending out terrifying fist forces.</p><p>He used his formation and martial arts to block the many heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you won’t be able to leave today. So what if you’ve saved the People of the Talisman sect? You have to stay too!”</p><p>Brother Litian’s eyes were cold. A flaming sword appeared in his hand, and it was emitting a shocking heat.</p><p>This was li fire, an extremely terrifying flame, not inferior to the Wang family’s purple Extreme Heavenly Fire.</p><p>At the same time, Blood Sword seven and blood Sword Nine’s bodies glowed with a blood-red light. The blood-red sword light exuded a strong bloody aura, cutting through the void and slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>One of the sky demon Valley’s elites transformed into a fierce tiger. His claws were like heavenly blades, cutting through the space and clawing at him.</p><p>At the same time, the attacks of the little demon Lord and a green-robed genius of the heavenly monster tribe arrived.</p><p>When the six paragons joined forces, their power was shocking.</p><p>The six of them attacked Lu Ming from different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take it head-on. Instead, he rushed in the direction of Blood Sword nine, who seemed to be the weakest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The punch landed on the blood-colored sword radiance. Blood Sword Nine’s body trembled violently and he continued to retreat. Lu Ming strode forward and dodged the attacks of the various geniuses. He ran towards the lightning zone at top speed.</p><p>not good! The lightning zone is the way out. He wants to go in! Stop him!</p><p>Li Tianhe roared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Tiger roared and pounced on Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body paused and he retreated abruptly, avoiding the Tiger’s attack and dodging to the other side.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord shouted angrily, and the black Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body paused again. Like a slippery Loach, he dodged the little demonic Lord’s attack in a flash and dodged to the other side.</p><p>His body was extremely agile, charging left and right, not fighting them head-on at all.</p><p>In addition, they had to guard against the escape route and the array in front of them to prevent Lu Ming from breaking out of the encirclement. They were distracted and could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The six heaven’s favorites were so angry that they wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>As for the others, they could not stop Lu Ming at all. Once Lu Ming crashed into them, their bones were broken and their tendons snapped, sending them flying far away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed again and he rushed to the flame area.</p><p>They thought that the flame area was the way out and hurriedly stopped him. However, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly turned and he rushed toward the poisonous area.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming shook them off and stepped into the poisonous zone. In a flash, his figure disappeared.</p><p>“This is the way out, charge in!”</p><p>The green-robed young man from the sky demon Valley was the fastest. He followed closely behind Lu Ming and rushed into the poisonous zone.</p><p>However, as soon as he rushed into the poisonous area, he immediately let out a blood-curdling scream and turned into a green Divine Eagle. He only managed to rush out after using all his strength, but his entire body was green. He had already been poisoned.</p><p>If not for his profound cultivation and powerful combat strength, he would have died inside.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had been walking in circles with them just now to calculate the time. He had calculated the time well and just as the time for the poisonous zone to become a path of survival was about to run out, Lu Ming rushed in.</p><p>When the green-robed young man followed him in, the path of life had changed into a path of death.</p><p>Lu Ming had already calculated all of this.</p><p>ah! Damn you, Lu Ming! B * stard, beast, I’ll kill you!</p><p>The little demon Lord let out an angry roar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
