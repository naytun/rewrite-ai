He did not show any mercy. His first move was a killing move. He wanted to kill Lu Ming with a powerful attack.</p><p>...</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so terrifying that he could destroy his attack and attack him.</p><p>A ball of purple flame appeared above his head. As soon as the flame appeared, the space around him crackled as if it was a fuel that was burning fiercely.</p><p>The seven golden chakras on the flame also attracted everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Divine level rank 7 bloodline.</p><p>Wang fentian’s bloodline level had reached the terrifying Level Seven divine level.</p><p>Wang fentian’s body turned into light and merged with his bloodline. Then, the purple flames twisted and turned into a flame giant that was more than ten meters tall.</p><p>The flame giant held a flame sword and slashed it down at Lu Ming. The scorching flames shook Lu Ming’s four-colored will.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with intense killing intent. The nine Dragon bloodline emerged and in the next moment, Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>A divine level rank 6 nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on Lu Ming and the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>it’s the nine Dragons, the legendary Nine Dragons!</p><p>“I didn’t expect Lu Ming to awaken the nine Dragons bloodline!”</p><p>my God, the nine Dragons are existences that surpass the true dragon. I’ve never heard of anyone who can awaken the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>As soon as the nine Dragon bloodlines appeared, the surrounding people exclaimed in shock.</p><p>This was especially so for the people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons! It’s the bloodline of the nine Dragons! No wonder he can control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It must be related to the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan muttered to himself.</p><p>“The bloodline of the nine Dragons! I must get it!”</p><p>A Supreme flood Dragon from the demon race glared at Lu Ming with burning eyes, as if he wanted to swallow Lu Ming whole.</p><p>There was also ao tu, the flood dragon race’s prodigy, whose eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons was a deadly temptation to the flood-Dragon Tribe elder.</p><p>Di Yi, you personally took action to capture Lu Ming. It seems that you knew that he had the nine Dragon bloodline. Your goal was the nine Dragon bloodline, right? ”</p><p>The demon Emperor’s voice resounded throughout the entire area. His bright eyes fell on Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Perhaps, it was true.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi snorted and did not speak.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar reverberated throughout the fighting ring.</p><p>The nine Dragons stepped in the air and grabbed Wang fentian’s sword with their nine claws.</p><p>With a loud boom, the sword collapsed, and the Dragon Claw continued to attack.</p><p>The flame giant roared in anger. Its terrifying fist was aimed at Lu Ming, but it was blocked by a Dragon Claw.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was used continuously, and six waves of power blasted toward the flame giant.</p><p>At the same time, it opened its mouth wide and its devouring power burst forth, enveloping the flame giant. Immediately, the flames on the flame giant’s body trembled non-stop, as if they were about to collapse.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The divine Dragon wagged its tail, and the nine Dragons ‘tail whipped towards the flame giant. This move contained the might of the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The flame giant was struck by the dragon’s tail, and a large part of its body exploded, leaving a huge gap.</p><p>The flame giant staggered back. The hole in its body was quickly healing, and the flames spread again.</p><p>“Sky-burning flame sword!”</p><p>The flame giant roared in anger. The sword in his hand slashed out a hot sword light towards the head of the nine Dragons. However, the nine Dragons grabbed out with their sharp claws and blocked his sword.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>Of course, during this process, Lu Ming had only used one burst of dragon energy and had not used his full strength.</p><p>Wang fentian was only his first opponent. There were more powerful opponents after him. His final opponent was the Emperor God.</p><p>Wang fentian’s strength was indeed terrifying. If he were to fight Luo Tian at the same level, he would be stronger than Luo Tian.</p><p>However, Wang fentian was strong, but Lu Ming was stronger. After a few dozen moves, he was completely suppressed.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and grabbed the flame giant with their nine claws. With a powerful tear, the flame giant exploded and turned into flames.</p><p>However, these flames drifted back and actually began to condense in the air again.</p><p>A natural-type bloodline had an advantage, and that was extremely tenacious vitality.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance. He stomped with his dragon claws and activated the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. A huge force struck the flames. The flames that were about to merge exploded again.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on him without blinking.</p><p>Could it be that Wang fentian was going to be defeated?</p><p>This extremely talented genius who had awakened a seventh level divine level bloodline was going to be killed by Lu Ming?</p><p>“No, no, damn it!”</p><p>The master of the Wang clan was extremely nervous.</p><p>Wang fentian was a peerless heaven’s favorite that only appeared once every few thousand years in the Wang family. His talent was even stronger than when he was young. He was going to inherit Wang fentian’s legacy in the future. But now, he was in danger.</p><p>Because this was a life-and-death battle. One party could only stop after they died in battle. But now, Wang fentian was completely suppressed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and devouring power burst out from their mouths. They swallowed a large ball of Wang fentian’s flames.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Wang fentian’s terrified scream could be heard from within the flames.</p><p>When the nine Dragons devoured the flames, they were constantly refined by their terrifying refining power.</p><p>Don’t you have a strong life force and can condense it? Then I’ll refine you.</p><p>The remaining flames flew back rapidly and gathered together, turning back into Wang fentian’s appearance.</p><p>At this moment, his face was pale, his body was trembling, and blood was flowing out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>His eyes were filled with intense fear.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons stepped forward and pressed toward Wang fentian.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, don’t kill me. Let me go!”</p><p>no! Wang fentian cried out in horror as he retreated.</p><p>He no longer had the strength to fight.</p><p>“Let you go? Have you forgotten that this is a life-and-death battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>you’re the winner. You’re the winner now. If the winner opens his mouth, he can go around the other party!</p><p>Wang fentian shouted.</p><p>In a life-and-death battle where life and death were seen, it would usually only end when one side died in battle.</p><p>Of course, there was another situation where the winner would take the initiative to spare the other party. That would also work.</p><p>However, since it was a life-and-death battle, how could the winner possibly spare the other party?</p><p>haha, Wang fentian, are you joking? why should I let you off? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Wang fentian was at a loss for words. That’s right. Why would Lu Ming let him off? they were mortal enemies.</p><p>However, he really didn’t want to die. With his unparalleled talent, it wouldn’t be a big problem for him to break through to the Supreme level in the future. He even wanted to break through to the Supreme Emperor position and dominate the eastern barren territory.</p><p>He had a boundless future ahead of him, so how could he want to die?</p><p>But on what basis did he ask Lu Ming to let him off?</p><p>He couldn’t help but look at the Wang family’s master.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let Fen Tian go and I’ll let go of what happened in the past!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan spoke, but his voice was cold and even revealed a hint of command.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
