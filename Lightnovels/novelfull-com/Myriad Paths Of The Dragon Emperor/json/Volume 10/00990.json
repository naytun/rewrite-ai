During this period of time, Lu Ming had almost cultivated it to the highest level.</p><p>This was the benefit of increasing one’s comprehension. In addition, he was focused on cultivating martial arts and was not distracted by the Dao of inscription. He made rapid progress in all aspects.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A mountain range appeared in front of them.</p><p>On the mountain range, cranes stood on the peaks, and ancient trees towered into the sky. There were constant roars of beasts.</p><p>Finally, they came across a mountain range that was full of life.</p><p>this place should be close to the central continent. According to the ancient records, as long as we cross this mountain range, we will reach the central continent!</p><p>There was a look of anticipation in Lu Ming’s eyes, but he did not relax.</p><p>It was said that there were powerful ferocious beasts living in the mountain range near the central continent. Some of them could tear apart spiritual God Realm powerhouses. Lu Ming did not dare to let his guard down.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and rushed into the mountain range.</p><p>Not long after he entered the mountain range, Lu Ming was attacked by a powerful beast. He killed it and devoured its demonic power and blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence was used to improve the bloodline, and the demonic power was used to temper the body.</p><p>Ten days later, in a hidden crack in a rock, a scroll floated.</p><p>It was the mountain and river diagram, and Lu Ming was cultivating in it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above his head, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline floated, flashing and shaking slightly.</p><p>Four golden chakra glowed, but after a while, another golden chakra spread out.</p><p>The fifth golden chakra, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline, had also reached level five of the divine level.</p><p>During this period of time, almost all the blood essence that Lu Ming devoured had been used to upgrade the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline.</p><p>“Let’s see how powerful the prison suppressing heavenly art has become!”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and struck with his palm.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The space twisted rapidly, and a mountain in the distance collapsed.</p><p>the increase doesn’t seem to be that terrifying. According to this increase, if I use it with all my strength, its power should be equivalent to the mid-level power of a low-grade divine martial technique!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Previously, when the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline was at divine level four, the power of the prison suppressing heavenly technique was equivalent to the first stage of a low-grade divine level martial arts technique. Lu Ming had thought that the power of the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline would be equivalent to the sixth stage of a low-grade divine level martial arts technique.</p><p>However, from the looks of it now, it had yet to reach that level. It seemed to be at about the fourth stage. It was estimated that the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique would only reach the sixth stage of a low-grade divine level martial technique when he reached level six.</p><p>Divine Level Seven could reach the level of high-grade divine level martial techniques.</p><p>A high-grade God-level martial technique was a martial technique that could only be successfully cultivated by an Emperor.</p><p>I don’t know what’s going on with my third bloodline. It can’t be awakened yet!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming frowned again.</p><p>Up until now, his third bloodline had not been awakened. It seemed to be still in the process of being nurtured. This made Lu Ming speechless.</p><p>The other geniuses had already awakened their third bloodline.</p><p>Most of the elites would awaken their third bloodline at the spiritual ocean tier. Only a small number of them would awaken their third bloodline at the spirit embryo tier.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had already reached the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, but his third bloodline had yet to awaken. This made him a little depressed.</p><p>Could it be that the third bloodline could only be awakened when one reached the spiritual God Realm? in history, it was extremely rare to awaken the third bloodline in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>ah, forget it. It’s useless to think so much. Let nature take its course. I have the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Even if I can’t awaken the third bloodline, I won’t be worse than others!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. Then, he exited the mountain and river diagram and continued to move forward in the mountain range.</p><p>……</p><p>Central continent, the easternmost land, was the chaotic territory near the East barren.</p><p>On the edge of a majestic mountain range, two young women were carefully running through the forest.</p><p>These two women were about twenty years old and looked almost identical. One look and one could tell that they were twin sisters.</p><p>The two of them had Jade-like skin and unparalleled beauty. Both of them were extremely beautiful, but at this moment, both of them had a serious expression on their faces. They concealed their auras and moved forward carefully.</p><p>“Achoo, be careful, don’t run too fast!”</p><p>One of the women whispered.</p><p>Lei, don’t worry. This is just the outer area of the chaotic mountains. There won’t be any strong beasts here!</p><p>The other girl was more lively. She smiled and said in a low voice.</p><p>we’ve been here for a few days, but we haven’t seen the poisonous Rainbow Snake. We don’t know where it is either!</p><p>The woman called ah Lei sighed in a low voice.</p><p>“Ah Lei, do you think that’s why we can’t find the poisonous Rainbow Snake because we’re on the outskirts of the mountain range? if we can’t find the poisonous Rainbow Snake, then we can’t find the accompanying spirit medicine to cure grandpa’s poison. Ah Lei, should we go deeper into the mountain range?”</p><p>Said a-Qing.</p><p>yes, that’s the only way. But don’t be reckless, a-Qing. We’ll slow down!</p><p>Miss ah Lei said.</p><p>Then, the two girls carefully went deeper into the mountain range, carefully avoiding a few powerful beasts.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar of a beast came from the depths of the mountain.</p><p>The roar of a beast sounded like a thunderclap. A vast demonic power soared into the sky, and a terrifying spatial crack appeared in the sky. The clouds were directly swallowed by the spatial crack and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, the roars sounded again, as if they were filled with endless anger. The entire mountain range trembled and made a loud rumbling sound.</p><p>Even though they were separated by a great distance, the two girls “faces still changed greatly. They immediately turned white, without a trace of blood.</p><p>“This … It’s a level 8 vicious beast! It’s enraged! Lei, let’s go!”</p><p>Miss a ‘Zhen’s voice trembled. She didn’t have the courage as before, and she pulled miss a’ Lei and ran back.</p><p>OWW! Roar!</p><p>At this moment, within the mountain range, the roars of the beasts could be heard. The roars of the beasts rang out one after another, and they seemed to be extremely frightened.</p><p>The two little girls were even more shocked. They knew that the King of the Mountain range was furious, and the beasts were frightened. Many powerful vicious beasts were probably going to run away in all directions, making it extremely dangerous.</p><p>The two little girls used all their strength to run out of the mountain range.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In all directions, there were fierce beasts running away. Fortunately, these fierce beasts seemed to be scared out of their wits and ignored the two sisters, so the two sisters were safe.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>That earth-shaking roar came from the depths of the forest. It was earth-shattering and its aura was terrifying.</p><p>The two sisters ran for an hour before they ran out of the mountain range and arrived outside.</p><p>At this time, the two of them let out a long sigh of relief. They were safe for the time being.</p><p>“Lei, what’s going on? Why would a level 8 vicious beast suddenly become so angry?”</p><p>Seeing that she was out of danger, miss a ‘Zhen’s mind became active again, and her big eyes were full of curiosity.</p><p>“I don’t know. Ah Luo, it seems like we can’t find the poisonous Rainbow Snake. What about grandpa’s poison?”</p><p>Ah Lei sighed, and the two sisters ‘eyes dimmed again.</p><p>Their cultivation was too low, so they didn’t dare to go too deep into the mountain range.</p><p>“Eh? There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Suddenly, a-Qing exclaimed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
