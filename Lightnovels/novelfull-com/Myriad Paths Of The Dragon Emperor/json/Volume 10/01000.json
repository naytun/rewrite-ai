I’m here to apologize to you. Why don’t you join us? ”</p><p>well, that’s good. There’s wine to drink, so there’s no reason to refuse!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Then, the group of six came to the main hall. There was indeed a table of fine wine and delicacies.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun poured a cup of wine for everyone, then raised his cup and said, father, ah Zhen, ah Lei, and young master Lu, I have made a huge mistake. I will drink this as punishment!</p><p>Then, he picked up his wine cup and drank it all.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei also picked up their glasses and took a sip.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his glass with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“Young master Lu, please!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not drink, a trace of panic flashed in the depths of Xiao Hongyun’s eyes. Then, he put on a sincere smile and said.</p><p>“It’s good wine indeed! You’ll know once you smell it!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed, then picked up the glass and drank it in one go.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>young master Lu is so generous. Come, let’s eat!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun laughed as everyone sat down. Xiao ning then poured wine for everyone.</p><p>young master Lu, you are so young and yet you have such a high cultivation. I really admire you. I have never heard of your name before. May I know which force you are from? ”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said.</p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Zhan, ah Luo and ah Lei also showed a curious look.</p><p>It had been half a year since the battle of Providence had ended. During the battle of Providence, all the hidden geniuses, the geniuses secretly nurtured by the unparalleled experts, had appeared one after another. By now, who didn’t know the names of these geniuses?</p><p>However, they were unfamiliar with Lu Shaoqing. Did he not participate in the battle of Providence?</p><p>I don’t come from any force. I used to cultivate in the deep mountains. This is the first time I’m coming out of the mountains!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Could it be that Lu Ming really did not participate in the battle of Providence?</p><p>This was really rare. Generally speaking, almost all geniuses who encountered a battle of Providence would be tempted.</p><p>haha, young master Lu, you have such a cultivation base even though you have not participated in the battle of Providence. This is rare. Come, let me toast to you!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun picked up his wine cup and downed it in one go.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and drank the wine in one gulp.</p><p>good wine, it’s really good wine. You’re so thoughtful!</p><p>Lu Ming clicked his tongue and had a look of enjoyment on his face.</p><p>haha, it seems like young master Lu is a wine lover. You can have a few more if you like!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun said with a smile.</p><p>Xiao ning immediately poured a glass of wine for Lu Ming and said,”Brother Lu, I hope you can forgive me for my previous offense!”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, picked up the glass, and drank it in one gulp.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning’s faces were filled with joy.</p><p>After that, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning repeatedly apologized to Xiao Zhan, a ‘Lei and a’ Zhen, and toasted to the others.</p><p>Soon, the Xiao sisters ‘faces turned red, and they looked exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>“Grandpa, ah Luo, why do I feel a little cold?”</p><p>At this time, ah Lei whispered.</p><p>“I, also feel a little cold!”</p><p>A-Qing shivered and exhaled. A layer of frost actually formed in the air.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s expression changed.</p><p>Ah Luo and ah Lei were both at the perfected spirit sea realm. Why did they suddenly feel cold? Even in a World of Ice and snow, they couldn’t possibly feel cold.</p><p>At this time, Xiao Zhan also felt a trace of coldness in his meridians.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xiao Zhan suddenly stood up from his chair and stared at Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning like a Mad Lion. He roared,”Evil creatures, you poisoned the wine?”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, Xiao Zhan felt the world spin around him. He couldn’t stand still and sat back down in his chair.</p><p>Ah ke and ah Lei looked at Xiao Hongyun in disbelief.</p><p>They had never thought that Xiao Hongyun would actually poison them. Didn’t Xiao Hongyun already admit his mistake? Could it be that everything was fake?</p><p>The two sisters found it unbelievable.</p><p>“It’s so cold!”</p><p>ah! ah Lei shouted. At this moment, her face was no longer red, but a layer of frost had appeared.</p><p>At the same time, a layer of frost would appear in the air with every breath they exhaled.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Hongyun laughed hysterically.</p><p>“Old man, you two stinky girls still want to leave? If you leave, what will happen to ning ‘er and me? We can’t let our bright future be ruined by you!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun laughed out loud. At this moment, he had completely revealed his true nature, and his face was filled with ferocity.</p><p>“And you, boy, if you dare to interfere, I’ll make sure you die without a burial ground!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>“Evil creature, evil creature!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan roared, his heart filled with pain and disappointment.</p><p>Just now, he had really thought that Xiao Hongyun had found his conscience and changed for the better. He did not expect that everything was fake and that it was all an act.</p><p>He pretended to be pitiful and remorseful in front of them just to trick them into drinking and eating. He had already poisoned the food and wine.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Zhan’s face was also covered in a layer of white frost.</p><p>A layer of light emanated from his body as he tried to force out the poison. However, he had not fully recovered and it was useless.</p><p>“Old man, don’t force the poison out. It’s useless. This is the snow heart poison, which is ten times more poisonous than the seven-colored poisonous snake. You can’t force it out.” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun sneered.</p><p>“Snow heart poison!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s face was filled with sorrow.</p><p>The snow heart poison was very famous among all the strange poisons in the world. Without an antidote, even a spiritual God Realm master would find it difficult to force out the poison!</p><p>“Old man, I might as well tell you one more thing. When you were bitten by a seven-colored poisonous snake in the chaotic mountains, it was young master yunkong who sent people to lure the snake over. Otherwise, hehe!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun continued to sneer.</p><p>“What? Evil creature, so my whereabouts were also revealed by you?”</p><p>Xiao Zhan staggered and almost lost his balance.</p><p>“Hahaha, not bad! Other than me, ning ‘er, and ah Zhen and ah Lei, who else would know about your whereabouts?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“Evil beast!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s face was filled with despair.</p><p>“If you don’t die, how can I take charge of the Xiao family? also, if you don’t die, how can these two girls marry Ling yunkong? Don’t you know that you’re an obstacle to me?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s expression was ferocious.</p><p>that’s right, old man. I’m also your grandson, but why are you so biased towards these two stinky girls? they clearly have such great value, so why do you want to keep them and waste them, huh? ”</p><p>Desolate ning was also screaming.</p><p>Xiao Zhan had completely given up. Xiao Hongyun and his son were no different from animals.</p><p>“It’s not just the two of you, right? the others are also about to arrive!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Hehe, kid, you’re right!”</p><p>A sneer rang out, and with a flash, more than a dozen people appeared in the hall.</p><p>Ling Kai and a few other young men from the floating mountain martial school were among them.</p><p>It was Ling Kai who had just spoken.</p><p>Other than Ling Kai, there were seven or eight more middle-aged or old men. All of them had powerful auras and profound cultivation.</p><p>Not only did they poison him, but they also called for help. It could be said that they were absolutely safe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
