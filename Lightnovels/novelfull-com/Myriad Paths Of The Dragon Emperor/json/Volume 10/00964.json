In the eighth battlefield, unless everyone else’s fate was added together, they would not be able to compare to Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming went on a rampage. Those who ran into Lu Ming were killed by him immediately when they tried to attack him. Some of them even shouted that they admitted defeat.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming was accompanied by more than ten Talisman Amulet sect disciples.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to bring them to the end.</p><p>not good! Rukong is in danger. He’s going to encounter an Emperor God!</p><p>In the stands, an elder suddenly shouted.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense on the eighth battlefield. Everyone’s eyes turned to the other battlefields.</p><p>Everyone from the talisman sect turned to look at the first battlefield.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect’s paragons were all in the first battlefield.</p><p>Everyone could see that ru Kong was hurrying on his way. The fate Dragon above his head had reached a height of about 200 feet.</p><p>On the other side, the Emperor God was flying toward ru Kong at a terrifying speed, but ru Kong didn’t seem to notice him.</p><p>If this continued, the two of them would soon bump into each other.</p><p>The talisman sect’s people were on tenterhooks.</p><p>Sure enough, in just a dozen breaths, the two of them met.</p><p>Ru Kong turned around upon hearing the commotion, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Without hesitation, ru Kong was about to admit defeat.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At the same time, the Emperor God made his move. A ray of sword light was incredibly fast. It seemed to penetrate layers of space in an instant and cut ru Kong’s body almost instantly.</p><p>‘I admit defeat!’ Before ru Kong could finish his sentence, he was torn into pieces by the sword light.</p><p>Fast, too fast, so fast that even the air could not react.</p><p>“Ru Kong!”</p><p>Du songjue roared in grief.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The other patriarchs and elders of the talisman Amulet sect looked dejected.</p><p>Ru Kong, an expert of the talisman sect who was second only to Huan Zhen and ranked 15th on the list of top 1000 talents, had been killed just like that. He was almost defenseless in the hands of the God Emperor.</p><p>The fighting power of an Emperor God was unfathomable.</p><p>After the Emperor God killed ru Kong and devoured the fate Dragon, he did not stop. He turned into a golden light and flew away.</p><p>“Hahaha! Good kill! All of your talisman sect’s paragons will be exterminated!”</p><p>“Although Lu Ming is safe now, he will still die if he encounters the Emperor God in the future!”</p><p>In the area of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, mocking laughter rang out.</p><p>Du songjue and the rest clenched their fists tightly.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect originally had 13 zongzis. Seven of them had already fallen, and now, one more had fallen, leaving only five.</p><p>Then, they turned their attention to Wen zhishi and the rest.</p><p>Unfortunately, their luck wasn’t good either. They met an undefeatable expert, but fortunately, they weren’t killed in one strike and all admitted defeat.</p><p>As time passed, some people were killed, but more and more people were either defeated or sent out of the battlefield.</p><p>On the grandstand, more and more people appeared. Many of them sighed. After admitting defeat, there was not much luck left.</p><p>Ruan Tingting also appeared in the stands. When she met a strong opponent, she immediately admitted defeat.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the eight battlefields, the fighting was getting more and more intense.</p><p>Lu Ming was almost invincible in the eighth battlefield.</p><p>Behind him, several experts who had transformed their Providence into a Dragon ran into Lu Ming. However, when they saw Lu Ming’s true dragon of Providence that was hundreds of feet long, their expressions changed drastically, and they turned to run.</p><p>They were not fools. Lu Ming had survived until now, and his fate Dragon had grown by a few hundred feet. Needless to say, those who were plotting against Lu Ming had given their fate to him. What were they waiting for if not to run?</p><p>However, with Lu Ming’s speed, how could they escape? in the end, they all admitted defeat.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s true dragon of Providence was close to a terrifying height of 1500 feet. It circled in the sky and could be seen from afar. Those who saw it from afar had a drastic change in their expressions and turned to run.</p><p>Even the genius of the sky demon Valley, who was as famous as Luo Tian, ran faster than anyone else.</p><p>This made Lu Ming a little depressed. The distance was too far and it would be more troublesome for him to chase after them. He was also afraid that he would be lured away and the talisman sect disciples would be in danger. Therefore, Lu Ming could not be bothered to chase after them.</p><p>The situation on the eighth battlefield had been settled, and the first battlefield was about the same. The other battlefields were filled with smoke.</p><p>illusion reality has encountered Dongfang Yu!</p><p>An elder of the talisman sect called out. The others turned their attention to the fourth battlefield, their hearts in their throats.</p><p>The experts from the other factions also turned their attention to the fourth battlefield.</p><p>Huan Zhen and Dong Fang Yu, this was a battle of the peak.</p><p>Huan Zhen was ranked eighth on the list of top 1000 talents, while Dongfang Yu was ranked third, just behind di Shen and Xue Jian Yi.</p><p>As soon as the two met, an intense battle unfolded.</p><p>However, it was obvious that Dong Fang Yu was stronger. However, Huan Zhen did not want to make any mistakes, so he was on the defense the entire time.</p><p>Huan Zhen was like a bright moon. His entire body was glowing. Bright moons appeared in front of him, blocking his attacks.</p><p>This was a formation carved with one’s own body, and it was an extremely powerful defensive formation. It was many times stronger than the formation that Ji mai had carved with his own body.</p><p>At the same time, runes and arrays appeared around Huan Zhen, which activated the runes.</p><p>All sorts of light glowed continuously as all sorts of defensive formations were formed.</p><p>Although the east side was extremely powerful, Huan Zhen was focused on defense. It was impossible for him to break through in a short time.</p><p>The two of them were in a deadlock. In the end, Dongfang Yu had no choice but to retreat. This made the talisman Amulet sect members heave a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace snorted unhappily. They felt that it was a pity that Dongfang Yu did not kill Huan Zhen.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the second battlefield, fatty and Wang fentian were fighting.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The moment Wang fentian saw fatty, he exploded with a sharp killing intent and launched a Swift attack.</p><p>He knew that the fatty was the disciple of the devil Sky sovereign, but this was a Battle of Destiny. Even if he killed the fatty, the devil Sky sovereign couldn’t say anything.</p><p>“Damn it, you want to kill me? you’re still ten thousand years too early!”</p><p>Fatty shouted and activated his bloodline.</p><p>His third bloodline and eight golden chakras almost made Wang fentian’s eyes pop out.</p><p>Even the spirit God and Supreme-being experts in the stands could not control their emotions. They stood up in shock.</p><p>An eighth-ranked divine bloodline. It was actually an eighth-ranked divine bloodline. This was too terrifying.</p><p>Other than the few sovereigns, the others were all extremely shocked.</p><p>“Senior mo Tian’s disciple is extraordinary as expected!”</p><p>The nine suns Paragon sighed.</p><p>Du songjue and the others nodded their heads. They had seen fatty before, but they didn’t expect this unreliable fatty to be so terrifying. As expected of the disciple of an Emperor.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Wang clan master and the others growled in shock.</p><p>An eighth level divine level expert was extremely rare. For example, Yan kuangtu was an eighth level divine level expert. His battle prowess was extremely powerful, and he was able to take on three great Supremes by himself.</p><p>They recalled that this fatty was Lu Ming’s sworn brother.</p><p>“Fen Tian, kill this fatty, kill him!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan growled.</p><p>This fatty was too terrifying. Once he grew up in the future, he would be another Yan Kuang tu.</p><p>Now was the perfect time to kill him. After this, the devil Sky sovereign would not be able to say anything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
