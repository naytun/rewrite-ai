However, the mountain and river diagram was shining, and it could not break free at all.</p><p>“It’s indeed useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>This was a usage he thought of at the last minute.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was a treasure that contained a world within it. Naturally, it was strong and immortal. If the Golden Tiger was trapped, it should not be able to break free.</p><p>As expected, the effect was very good. The Golden Tiger was trapped.</p><p>“Ro li, let’s see who else can help you now!”</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘eyes glowed with a ferocious light as they pounced at the little demon Lord, using the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The little demonic Lord was no match for him and kept retreating. The bone spikes on his body were broken, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>The little demon Lord was scared and wanted to escape, but the nine Dragons had completely blocked his way out. How could he escape?</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Then, the little demonic Lord screamed as one of his arms was torn off by the nine Dragons. The huge demonic creature’s body shrank rapidly and turned back into the little demonic Lord.</p><p>At this moment, his face was deathly pale, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The huge Dragon Claw grabbed at the little demon Lord.</p><p>no, no, Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. My brother is demonic Lord Luo Tian, tenth on the list of top 1000 talents. If you kill me, my brother will not let you off!</p><p>The little demonic Lord shouted as he resisted with all his might.</p><p>“What a joke. Weren’t you very arrogant before? Now that you’ve lost, you’re bringing up your big brother. What a waste.”</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly, his dragon claws not stopping.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The little demonic Lord screamed as a huge wound appeared on his body. Blood flowed out, and his aura became even weaker.</p><p>On the other side, the Golden Tiger let out a long roar. Its entire body emitted a brilliant golden light, but it was useless. It couldn’t break through the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The Dragon Claw continued to claw down and hit the little demon Lord’s chest. The little demon Lord was sent flying and crashed into the wall of a Palace. The palace did not move, but the little demon Lord’s bones cracked and he fell to the ground, unable to move like a dead fish.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into his human form and stepped forward, stepping on the little demon Lord’s face. A long spear appeared in his hand, and he pointed it at the little demon Lord’s heart.</p><p>“No, no, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The little demonic Lord was incomparably terrified. His entire body was cold as he felt the approaching death god.</p><p>He had never been so afraid before.</p><p>He had been a proud Son of Heaven since he was young. His brother, Luo Tian, was even more talented and almost invincible.</p><p>They had been taken in as Di Tian’s Imperial Guards since they were young and were carefully nurtured. He had never been so close to death before and had never been so afraid. It had always been him killing others. When had others been able to kill him?</p><p>On the list of top 1000 talents, those who were ranked higher than him had to give him face because his brother was Luo Tian.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s killing intent was extremely cold. He was not afraid of his big brother at all and wanted to kill him.</p><p>“If I don’t kill you, why didn’t you consider letting my Talisman Amulet sect’s disciples off when you killed them?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked down at the little demon Lord.</p><p>The little demonic Lord was speechless. In his heart, those talisman sect disciples were all trash, trash. How could they compare to him? But how could he say such thoughts out loud?</p><p>Lu Ming, my brother Luo Tian is unrivaled and ranked tenth on the list of top 1000 talents. His combat strength is far beyond your imagination. No matter how talented you are, you’re no match for my brother. You’d better let me go. Otherwise, no one can save you!</p><p>The little demon Lord continued to mention his elder brother, hoping to deter Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his foot hard and the little demon Lord’s face hit the ground hard. A few of his teeth fell out and blood flowed out of his mouth.</p><p>what a joke. No matter how strong Luo Tian is, he’s only ranked tenth on the list of top 1000 talents. There are nine humans above him, not including the demons. He’s invincible? ”</p><p>“Also, can your big brother compare to Di Yi? Now, even Di Yi wants to catch me, but I’m still fine. What do you mean by no one can save me? If your big brother comes, I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his killing intent growing stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop!”</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in a small alley. It was brother Litian.</p><p>ah, brother Litian, save me, save me!</p><p>Seeing brother Litian, the little demonic monarch shouted with all his might.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter who you call, just die!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the long spear in Lu Ming’s hand suddenly stabbed out, piercing the little demon Lord’s heart.</p><p>The little demonic Lord let out a hysterical scream, his eyes popping out, filled with unwillingness and hatred.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, vital essence exploded, crushing the little demon Lord’s heart into pieces. The little demon Lord died.</p><p>At the entrance of the alley, brother Litian’s face turned ugly. He turned around and disappeared into the alley in a flash.</p><p>Brother Litian knew very well that his combat strength was only slightly higher than the young Demon Lord. He was probably not Lu Ming’s match in a fight. He might as well leave.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced in the direction that brother Li Tian had left. He did not pursue him. Instead, he waved his hand and put away the little demonic Lord’s storage ring. Then, he walked towards the Golden Tiger.</p><p>“Ah, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The fierce Golden Tiger cried out in fear and struggled with all its might.</p><p>Seeing the little demon Lord being killed in front of him, he almost peed his pants.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and punched the Golden Tiger’s head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Golden Tiger was unable to resist and was hit by a heavy punch. It suddenly felt dizzy and felt as if its head was about to be crushed. It saw stars.</p><p>WOWO, this Tiger’s head is too hard. It’s actually not killed after one punch!</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little shocked.</p><p>He was well aware of how terrifying his punch was. However, he was surprised that it did not smash the Tiger’s head.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me! I admit defeat! I surrender! I’ll recognize you as my big brother! Please let me go!”</p><p>The ferocious Golden Tiger shook its head and actually loudly begged for mercy. It cried out in an extremely miserable manner.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m begging you. I have an eighty-year-old mother and a three-year-old child. I beg you, please spare me. From now on, you’re my big brother. I’ll be grateful for your kindness!”</p><p>The Golden Tiger continued to roar.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>This Golden Tiger was also a weirdo.</p><p>nonsense, I see that you have abundant Yang Qi. You clearly haven’t lost your virginity. Where did you come from, a three-year-old child!</p><p>Lu Ming rolled his eyes and then chided.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ That’s a child I picked up from the barren mountains, every word is true!”</p><p>The Golden Tiger’s eyes darted around as it continued to spout nonsense.</p><p>alright, don’t talk nonsense in front of me. You can surrender if you want, but relax your mind. I’m going to carve a formation in your mind. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease. I’ll have to kill you. You have fifty percent of the divine beast bloodline. The Tiger whip is also a great supplement!</p><p>As he said that, Lu Ming cast a few glances behind the Golden Tiger.</p><p>The Golden Tiger felt a chill run down its spine and it couldn’t help but clench its legs.</p><p>” Inscribe the formation!”</p><p>The Golden Tiger was a little hesitant. It was very clear that if the array was really engraved on it, it would really become Lu Ming’s slave.</p><p>However, if he did not agree, Lu Ming would not let him off.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
