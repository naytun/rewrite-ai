In a few breaths, he was close to the Golden pool.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Jin Chi was shocked and suddenly looked in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck towards the top of Jin Chi’s head.</p><p>This palm could split a mountain. Lu Ming had used all his strength.</p><p>Jinchi had never expected that there would be someone else here. In a hurry, he raised his arm to block.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Jinchi’s body was sent flying far away, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“It seems that he’s really seriously injured!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Previously, Luo Tian had been so afraid of Jinchi, which showed that Jinchi’s strength must be extremely terrifying. He was definitely not weaker than Luo Tian, or even stronger. Now that he had been sent flying by Lu Ming’s palm, it was clear that Jinchi had been seriously injured in the cave and was shrouded in poisonous gas. His strength had been greatly reduced.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to sneak attack me? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>As soon as Jinchi retreated, he was furious. His eyes were filled with a shocking murderous intent as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>After taking a look, Jinchi’s eyes widened and he exclaimed, ” “Lu Ming, you’re Lu Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming was not in disguise and the Golden pool could recognize him at a glance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. He strode forward and charged toward the Golden pool.</p><p>“Don’t think that you can kill me just because I’m injured. You’re the one who’s going to die today. I’ll kill you and get the reward from the flood Dragon sovereign!”</p><p>Jinchi’s voice was cold. A strong golden light burst out from his body and he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow. Lu Ming’s body swayed and he stood still, but Jin Chi was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Right now, you’re not my match at all!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about defense at all. He attacked the Golden pool frantically.</p><p>Every punch and palm strike contained the power of millions of Jun. They suppressed everything and poured madly into the Golden pool.</p><p>Moreover, many of the attacks were aimed at the round pearl above the Golden pool.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden pool exploded and collided with Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few dozen moves, the round bead on top of Jinchi’s head was shattered by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>The bead shattered and more poisonous gas gushed towards Jinchi. Jinchi’s face turned even greener.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Golden pool let out a shrill cry and transformed into its true form. It was a golden Luan. Of course, it was not a pure-blooded golden Luan. It had more than 60% of the Golden Luan’s bloodline.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming used the fusion of his blood meridians and transformed into Nine Dragons to continue his attack.</p><p>Jinchi coughed out blood continuously. His golden body was covered in a thick layer of poisonous green gas, and the concentration was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>The Golden pool tried its best to rush out but was held back by Lu Ming.</p><p>The longer this dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for Jinchi. His eyes were already filled with panic.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The claws of the nine Dragons clawed at Jinchi’s body and tore off a large piece of flesh. Golden feathers flew in the air and Jinchi let out a blood-curdling scream.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He used the nine Dragons heaven treading steps and took six steps in a row. The violent attacks poured onto Jinchi’s body, causing him to fall to the ground and create a huge pit.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons descended and grabbed Jinchi’s wings with their claws. They tore at Jinchi’s wings with all their might, and as blood splattered, the wings were torn off.</p><p>Jinchi let out a heart-wrenching scream. He no longer had that high and mighty attitude from before. What he had was only fear and embarrassment.</p><p>He was terrified. He could feel death approaching.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon Claw struck again, and a violent force blasted into Jin Chi’s body, dispersing all of his demonic power.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me, spare my life!”</p><p>Jinchi shouted. He didn’t want to die.</p><p>One of the nine Dragons ‘claws was on Jinchi’s neck. He looked at Jinchi with cold eyes and said, ” “Weren’t you high and mighty before? He’s so domineering, snatching other people’s things without even blinking.”</p><p>your biggest mistake was that you couldn’t bear to waste it. When you came out of the cave, you swallowed a few drops of the life potion, and your injuries would have healed immediately. I’m not your match either. It’s a pity that you couldn’t bear to waste the life potion, hehe!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered continuously.</p><p>“You’re one of the four?” Jinchi’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, spare me. I’ll give you whatever you want. I still have a lot of treasures in my storage ring, including the elixir of life. I can return them all to you as long as you let me go!”</p><p>Jinchi loudly begged for mercy.</p><p>“Spare you? Are you going to kill me after you’ve recovered? Am I that stupid? Besides, after I kill you, your treasures will be mine, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me. I swear, I will never seek revenge from you …”</p><p>Jin Chi shouted.</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, Lu Ming suddenly exerted his strength and swung his Dragon Claw, killing the Golden pool.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the demon race, who was comparable to the top 10 on the list of top 1000 talents, had died just like that. He had died with great regret.</p><p>The devouring power burst forth and devoured the blood essence energy of the Golden pool, taking away his storage ring. He glanced at the storage ring and indeed saw two Jade bottles. The Jade bottles contained the water of life.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He put away the storage ring and looked at the cave.</p><p>There was a creature in the cave, and it had fought with the Golden pool for so long. What happened?</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the creature in the cave would not be much stronger than the Golden pool. Otherwise, the Golden pool would not have dared to attack it repeatedly.</p><p>It couldn’t be much stronger than the Golden pool. If the Golden pool was injured, the creature couldn’t be intact. This might be a chance.</p><p>“The totem pole, could it be in this cave? Otherwise, why would Jinchi work so hard?”</p><p>At the thought of the totem pole, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully moved closer to the cave.</p><p>The hole was huge, and there was a faint light coming from inside.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in slowly and looked inside.</p><p>There was a huge cave inside. Behind the cave was another cave. The light was coming from that cave.</p><p>At the entrance of the cave, there was a huge colorful crab.</p><p>The giant crab was taller than a human just by lying there. However, there were many wounds on its body, and blood was still flowing out of them.</p><p>It seemed that this giant crab was the one who had fought the Golden pool.</p><p>However, this giant crab wasn’t any better off than Jinchi. Its aura was weak and it was obviously heavily injured.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers started to wave in the air and he started to inscribe the array.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, and his fingers were like lightning as they streaked across the air. Countless inscriptions entered the space.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The giant crab sensed the fluctuation and looked up. When it saw Lu Ming, it let out a sharp sound and got up, crawling toward him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted softly. The array in the air glowed and condensed into arrows, shooting them at the giant crab.</p><p>The giant crab waved its tail and blocked all the arrows.</p><p>At the same time, the giant crab spewed out a large amount of poisonous gas that spread toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
