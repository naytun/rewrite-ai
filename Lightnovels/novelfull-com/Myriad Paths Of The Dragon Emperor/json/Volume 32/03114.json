The contradictions were getting deeper and deeper. If this continued, it was not impossible for it to evolve into an intense war.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s face turned even colder as he asked coldly.</p><p>that’s all I have. Please forgive me, my King. I was blinded by greed for a moment and made a grave mistake. I won’t do it again!</p><p>“For my sister’s sake, please spare me!”</p><p>Sikong Nan shouted and continued to beg for mercy.</p><p>“There are some things that you have to pay a heavy price for being wrong once. If I let you go, how will I explain it to the others in the future? Who will listen to me in the future?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes said calmly. However, his voice was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>.com</p><p>Sikong Nan’s expression was ugly to death. He gritted his teeth and madly charged towards the back, wanting to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine absolutes Heavenly King also moved. His speed was so fast that it was unimaginable. With a flash, he closed the distance between him and sikong Nan. After a few flashes, he caught up to sikong Nan and pointed out.</p><p>The void trembled like a wave, giving off a terrifying explosion.</p><p>An enormous finger pressed towards sikong Nan.</p><p>Sikong Nan roared in fear and used all his strength to resist. However, his attack and defense were continuously being destroyed by the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s attacks.</p><p>ah, jiujue, you’ll die a horrible death. And that kid, he’ll die a horrible death …</p><p>Sikong Nan roared in anger, but in the next moment, his cry stopped abruptly.</p><p>That was because his body had exploded under Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘finger.</p><p>Even with his strong life force as a divine Lord, it was useless. His body exploded and his soul was annihilated. He had completely disappeared from this world.</p><p>A terrifying divine Lord realm powerhouse was killed just like that.</p><p>This was how cruel the great thousand world in the primal universe was.</p><p>No matter how high one’s cultivation base was, there would always be someone stronger. If one could not be the strongest, one could die at any time.</p><p>In the vast primal universe, countless experts fell at all times.</p><p>Therefore, at all times, every cultivator wanted to improve themselves and break through to a higher realm. In order to break through, they would do anything.</p><p>Just like sikong Nan, he was trapped in the first stage of the God monarch realm for countless years. In order to break through, he betrayed the nine absolute Heavenly King and helped the dark ice Race steal the nine absolute God crystal. He wanted to cause internal chaos in the nine absolute Heavenly King Estate.</p><p>After killing sikong Nan, Heavenly King Nine absolutes waved his hand and grabbed sikong Nan’s storage ring. Following that, a giant Dark Dragon corpse appeared in the sky.</p><p>“This is yours, right? I’ll return it to you!”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, put it away. You Long’s physical body has been cut off. It’s useless to me, but it’s of great use to you!”</p><p>Bone shouted in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Many thanks, Heavenly King!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks and then kept you Long’s corpse in a storage ring.</p><p>“This time, to be able to make sikong Nan give himself away and drag him out, you’ve done a great service!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts looked at Lu Ming and smiled faintly.</p><p>“I only did it for self-protection, it’s not a great merit!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No matter what the reason is, this time it was because of you that sikong Nan was caught. Of course, you have to be rewarded. How about this, this King will agree to a condition of yours. As long as you mention it, this King will definitely not refuse if it’s something this King can do!”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Han Ying and Wu Shan were even more envious.</p><p>This was one of the nine Arts Heavenly King’s conditions, and it was simply priceless.</p><p>“What are your conditions?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts asked.</p><p>“Heavenly King, can I leave this condition for now? I’ll bring it up after I’ve thought about it, okay?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had not thought of what conditions to raise. One of the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s conditions was a rare opportunity. It must be used where it was needed. It would be the best to raise it when it was needed.</p><p>you’re quite smart, little guy. Alright, you can bring it up when you’ve made up your mind. Take this voice transmission jade talisman. If you’ve made up your mind, you can send me a voice transmission at any time!</p><p>With that, Heavenly King Nine cuts took out a voice transmission jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, Heavenly King!”</p><p>Lu Ming received it with great joy.</p><p>“Well, I have to go back to deal with sikong clan. I have to go!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts left these words and took a step forward. The void rippled and Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘figure disappeared.</p><p>Apparently, Heavenly King Jiu Jue of sikong clan didn’t plan to stay either. They could imagine the outcome of sikong clan.</p><p>shuttling through the void. Divine Lord experts are truly terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>This was the primeval universe and the space was extremely stable. After Lu Ming came to the primeval universe, this was the first time he saw someone who could travel through the void.</p><p>Sikong Nan used it before, and now nine absolutes Heavenly King used it too!</p><p>“Kid, this is not void travel!”</p><p>Bone’s voice echoed in his mind.</p><p>“It’s not void blink?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>Before, sikong Nan and Heavenly King Nine cuts both appeared suddenly. What was it if not void travel?</p><p>the space of the primeval universe is extremely stable. It’s not something a small chiliocosm can compare with. Moreover, the primeval universe is so vast that its territory is many times larger than a small chiliocosm. It’s too difficult to travel through the void and the infinite starry sky!</p><p>Bone sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed.</p><p>The surface area of a small chiliocosm like the heaven realm and the primordial realm was far smaller than a life planet, let alone compared to the infinite universe.</p><p>In a small chiliocosm, being able to travel from one end to the other was only equivalent to a short distance on a planet in the primal universe.</p><p>In the starry sky, it was nothing.</p><p>“Then what about them?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>after breaking through to the divine Lord realm, one can use Supreme techniques to carve a starry sky teleportation formation on one’s body. They are activating the starry sky teleportation formation and teleporting themselves out. This has the same Marvel as traversing the void!</p><p>Bone explained.</p><p>he can actually carve a teleportation array on his own body. How amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>If he carved a teleportation array on his body, then his movement would be many times faster. He wouldn’t have to take other teleportation arrays.</p><p>of course, this method still has its weaknesses. In some aspects, it can’t be compared to void travel!</p><p>for example, it takes time to activate the teleportation formation. In a great battle, the opponent will not give you time to activate the teleportation formation!</p><p>another thing is that you can only use it by yourself. You can’t bring anyone else with you!</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. No wonder sikong Nan did not use the teleportation array to escape previously. It was because he did not have time to activate the teleportation array.</p><p>He was afraid that before he could even activate it, he would be killed by the nine extremes Heavenly King.</p><p>The other one could only be used by one’s own self. One couldn’t bring anyone along. One must know that one could bring others along with them when they traveled through the void.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
