As the name suggested, there were a total of eighteen levels in the eighteen levels of hell. Each level was more difficult than the previous.</p><p>However, you don’t need to pass the 18th floor. You pass as long as you pass the 9th floor.</p><p>Yuan Huan had said that even a peerless genius at the first level of the divine King realm would find it extremely difficult to pass the ninth level. Lu Ming was not too worried about this.</p><p>Just because a first level Divine King couldn’t pass it didn’t mean he couldn’t.</p><p>Back when he was a seventh-level heavenly God, he had defeated almost all the first-level Godking geniuses of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, including Yuan Yu, who had awakened his origin divine power factor for the second time.</p><p>Yuan Yu’s battle prowess was near invincible among first level divine kings. There were very few first level divine kings who could defeat Yuan Yu.</p><p>However, at the first level of the king God Realm, it was almost impossible for the origin divine power factor to awaken three times. It was too difficult.</p><p>There were also people like Lu Ming who had all kinds of heaven-defying means.</p><p>Thus, Yuan Yu practically represented the peak of the first level Godking realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was able to defeat Yuan Yu when he was only at the seventh level of the celestial deity realm. Now that he was at the eighth level, it would be even easier for him to defeat Yuan Yu. Hence, he was still rather confident that he could pass through the ninth level.</p><p>As long as he could pass the ninth level, he did not need to pass the eighteenth level. Lu Ming was rather confident.</p><p>Of course, his eighth level celestial deity cultivation was impossible to pass through the ninth level in the eyes of others.</p><p>it won’t be too late to tell you the details when the eighteen levels of hell open in three months. There’s another reason why I’m looking for you today!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Another matter? What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“War ancestor, are there some other people who entered the ghost’s domain with you?”</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Some other people? It’s LAN Feng and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Besides him, only LAN Feng and the others had entered ghost’s domain.</p><p>“War ancestor, are you friends with those people?”</p><p>Yuan Huan asked.</p><p>“No, it’s an enemy!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then asked, ” “Chief, where are those people now? what are they doing?”</p><p>those people have been attacking the divine statue mountain for the past few days. I thought they were the war ancestor’s friends, so I didn’t send anyone to deal with them. It turns out that they are the war ancestor’s enemies …</p><p>At this point, a cold light flashed in Yuan Huan’s eyes.</p><p>“God statue mountain? What’s there?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>LAN Feng had gathered so many people from the great illusionary divine capital in order to enter the demon ghost and obtain some kind of treasure.</p><p>This was definitely very valuable. Lu Ming was immediately interested.</p><p>If he could take away the treasure that LAN Feng had painstakingly wanted, the other party would probably die of anger.</p><p>there’s nothing else on the God statue mountain other than a god statue!</p><p>Yuan Huan replied.</p><p>“There’s nothing else other than a statue?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>Without treasures, what would LAN Feng do?</p><p>clan leader, can you lend me a group of experts? these people have a grudge against me. It’s time to settle this score!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, since they’re war ancestor’s enemies, they should be eliminated. I was just planning to send someone over!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Clan head, there are many experts in this group of people. There are even a few divine Lords …”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded.</p><p>“It’s fine, I’ll send some people over!”</p><p>With that, a pitch-black bone appeared in Yuan Huan’s hand and he began to transmit his voice.</p><p>“It seems like the strength of the nether ape battle clan is beyond my imagination!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Looking at Yuan Huan’s appearance, it was obvious that he didn’t care much about a few divine Lord existences. One could imagine that there were definitely many divine Lord powerhouses in the nether ape battle clan.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more determined to subdue the underworld ape combat clan. If he could make use of this powerful force, it would definitely be of great help to his future development.</p><p>Half an hour later, a group of nether ape combat clan members followed Lu Ming and flew into the distance from the nether ape combat clan’s territory.</p><p>“War ancestor, I’ll bring you along!”</p><p>Beside Lu Ming was an old nether ape with white hair. He was the strongest expert who had assisted Lu Ming this time. His name was Yuan Fei.</p><p>“Alright, thank you for your trouble, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, Yuan Fei waved his hand and a divine light enveloped Lu Ming. Instantly, their speed increased explosively and they flew into the distance.</p><p>In less than an hour, a towering mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>The mountain was extremely huge, towering into the clouds. It occupied an astonishingly large area, and one couldn’t see the end of it.</p><p>battle ancestor, this is the divine statue mountain. Those outsiders are on the divine statue mountain. Let’s kill our way up!</p><p>Yuan Fei said.</p><p>“Wait. minute, let’s go up from the other side …”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>He didn’t want to show his face yet. He wanted to see what LAN Feng was doing here.</p><p>If he directly attacked, he would not know LAN Feng’s purpose.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Yuan Fei nodded in agreement.</p><p>They were Yuan Huan’s direct descendants and were very supportive of Lu Ming. Hence, they would still listen to Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>Immediately, they rushed to the peak of the mountain from the other side.</p><p>The mountain was filled with all kinds of ghostly creatures. When they saw Lu Ming, they wanted to rush over. However, when they saw the nether ape war clan, fear appeared on their faces and they quickly retreated.</p><p>They made their way to the mountain peak without any obstructions, and soon, they were close to the peak.</p><p>Roar …</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>When they arrived, they heard ear-piercing and unpleasant strange cries from the other side. There were also all kinds of divine lights flashing and rumbling sounds. It was obvious that a great battle was going on.</p><p>They searched for rocks to hide themselves and looked into the distance.</p><p>The first thing he saw was a huge stone statue.</p><p>This stone statue was at least 3000 meters tall and was extremely huge.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the stone statue was a primitive God.</p><p>There were four huge stone chains around the stone statue.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw LAN Feng and the group of experts that LAN Feng had brought with her.</p><p>LAN Feng and the experts he brought were divided into two groups. One group was on the periphery because there were countless ghosts attacking them. These people were blocking these ghosts.</p><p>And LAN Feng personally led a group of experts to attack the four stone chains around the statue with all their might.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that one of the stone chains had already been broken. There were three chains left.</p><p>They were attacking the second one.</p><p>Clang clang clang …</p><p>One attack after another struck the stone chains, causing a deafening boom. The stone chains shook violently and sparks flew everywhere.</p><p>“What a tough chain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Participating in the attack on the chains were two terrifying divine Lord realm powerhouses and quite a number of high-level divine kings. So many powerhouses joining hands actually could not break the chains in one go.</p><p>It only caused a small gap to appear on the chain.</p><p>Divine Lord realm powerhouses could only leave a tiny gap on it. One could imagine how hard this kind of chain was.</p><p>Only when more and more cracks appeared could the chain be broken.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>Outside, countless ghostly beings of all kinds were constantly attacking LAN Feng and the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
