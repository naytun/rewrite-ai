Last time, he had joined forces with the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion to kill Lu Ming. If Lu Ming had not entered the life and death ethereal realm at the critical moment and comprehended the door of domination, the consequences would have been unpredictable.</p><p>Just now, the other party had joined forces with the Golden Elephant to kill him. How could Lu Ming let the other party off?</p><p>The speed of the leader of the winged people family was too fast. He was the first to charge at the leader of the Qin family.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was slightly faster than the Qin family’s leader. The distance between the two parties was rapidly closing.</p><p>“Not good, brother wing, come and help me!”</p><p>The Qin family’s leader shouted and asked the winged ones ‘leader for help.</p><p>However, the leader of the winged ones family did not dare to fight Lu Ming. He sped up and fled into the distance alone, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The other geniuses of the winged man race also fled.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The leader of the Qin clan shouted. He then rushed to the other Qin clan’s heaven’s favorites and shouted, ” “Quick, all of you attack together with me to stop this person. Time is almost up. Once the time is up, it will be the time of his death!”</p><p>This time, there were more than 20 Qin clan’s heaven’s favorites who entered.</p><p>However, after exchanging a glance, they all retreated at full speed.</p><p>If Lu Ming could kill the Golden Elephant so easily, it would be even easier for him to kill them. How would they dare to help the leading figure of the Qin family?</p><p>At this time, it didn’t matter if you were the leader or not, your life was more important.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The leader of the Qin family shouted in fear. However, Lu Ming had already caught up to him.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>A group of nine-clawed divine Dragons charged toward the Qin clan’s leader.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was still low. Perhaps, the power of one nine-clawed Divine Dragon was limited. However, the power of twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons attacking at the same time, and they were all attacking without regard for their lives, was extremely shocking.</p><p>In addition to the attack of the nine ice chains, the leader of the Qin family was flustered.</p><p>“Extreme Yin eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A vortex appeared above the Qin family’s leader’s head and spun wildly. Then, waves of cold energy gushed toward the leader.</p><p>“No, seven injury divine fist, block it!”</p><p>The leader of the Qin family roared and injured himself with divine power to strengthen the power of the seven injuries divine fist. He continuously punched out with fist force, trying to block the extreme Yin eye’s extreme cold power.</p><p>As expected, the terrifying fist force exploded and the extreme Yin eye’s cold power was temporarily blocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s follow-up attack had arrived.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out, as if it was a talisman that urged him to die.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying spear radiance burst forth and struck the body of the Qin clan’s leader. The leader’s body trembled violently and he was sent flying, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>This time, he was prepared and was not killed in one move like Jin Xiang. However, he was still no match for Lu Ming and was severely injured.</p><p>The Qin family’s young man rushed towards the nine blades Heavenly King mansion in fear and shouted, ” “Didn’t you want to kill this kid? This man is too monstrous. If he kills us, he’ll kill you too!”</p><p>At this moment, the Qin clan’s Paragon could only place his hopes on the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>indeed, this kid is too monstrous. Let’s attack together and kill him!</p><p>A cold and indifferent voice rang out. It was Duan Jiang.</p><p>Duan Jiang did not manage to kill Lu Ming the last time. Now that he realized that Lu Ming’s abilities had grown stronger, he was rather frightened and could not wait to kill Lu Ming immediately.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion also spoke.</p><p>At once, seven to eight terrifying auras burst out and surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his spear and swept it out, destroying these auras. However, his figure was also blocked.</p><p>The leading figure of the Qin family took the opportunity to rush behind the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. He let out a long breath and relaxed.</p><p>He had finally gotten his life back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, after you die, I’ll feed your corpse to the wild dogs!”</p><p>The leader of the Qin family glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>The scene here could be seen from the outside. He had been in such a sorry state just now.</p><p>if you have the ability, then let’s fight one to one. You want to bully us with your numbers now, but have you asked us? ”</p><p>The leader of the Wu family roared and came to Lu Ming’s side with Zhao Mo, the leader of the family. Their powerful auras surged toward the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Do you think you can fight us with the three of you? You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Duan Jiang sneered.</p><p>“Everyone, are you just going to watch and not attack? If we work together, we don’t have to be afraid of them!”</p><p>The leader of the woo family looked at the geniuses of the other families.</p><p>Other than the Jin family, Qin family, and winged people family, there were a few other families that had geniuses that were not weaker than them. The leader of the Wu family wanted to ask them to attack together.</p><p>However, the paragons looked at the white-robed young man from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion with fear.</p><p>They were afraid of the white-robed young man.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally saw this scene.</p><p>“Everyone, if he makes a move, why don’t you leave it to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the white-robed young man.</p><p>“Leave it to you?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, the white-robed young man was a terrifying existence with the second awakening of divine power. It would be easy for him to kill the Golden Elephant. Although Lu Ming had killed the Golden Elephant just now, it was not so easy.</p><p>Lu Ming could fight against the white-robed young man?</p><p>“Lu Ming, this person has awakened the divine power factor for the second time!”</p><p>One of the heaven’s favorites reminded.</p><p>so he has awakened the divine power factor for the second time. No wonder!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was no wonder that when he had just arrived, no one had tried to snatch the divine power Pearl from him. It turned out that he had awakened the divine power factor for the second time, which shocked everyone.</p><p>“Interesting. Leave him to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to add.</p><p>This not only shocked the others, but also made the white-robed young man’s eyes shine.</p><p>everyone, the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s goal is very simple this time. They want to take out the divine power source Pearl and let the elites of the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion kill each other. This will provoke conflicts between the major families and weaken our strength so that they can take advantage of the situation!</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>He knew that nine blade Heavenly King bribed the master of sikong clan, so he could easily guess nine blade Heavenly King’s purpose.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. They knew that Lu Ming was right. This was the truth.</p><p>Outside the formation, the nine saber Heavenly King’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>This was an open scheme, and it was not difficult for others to guess his purpose.</p><p>However, the major families had been killing each other and many of their geniuses had fallen. The conflict had deepened. Even if they knew it was his scheme, the conflict could not be resolved.</p><p>This was the power of his scheme. Even if others knew about it, his scheme could still be realized.</p><p>also, there’s someone who has awakened the origin divine power factor for the second time in the nine blade Heavenly King’s residence. It’s obvious that he knows that the divine power origin Pearl will be taken by him. The nine blade Heavenly King has no intention of letting us get the divine power origin Pearl. From the beginning to the end, they’ve been toying with us!</p><p>“However, I will not do as he wishes. The divine power origin bead can not fall into the enemy’s hands. Everyone, let’s work together. You help me block these people while I take the divine power origin bead. What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice echoed throughout the entire venue.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
