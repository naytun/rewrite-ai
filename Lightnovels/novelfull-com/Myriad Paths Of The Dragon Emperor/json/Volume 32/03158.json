It was difficult to tell the direction inside, so it was naturally difficult to pass through this area.</p><p>LAN Feng had also brought an array master over. Through the research of the array master, if they wanted to pass through this area, they could only close the array in this area.</p><p>The formation master had discovered that this formation should have six formation eyes. Only by sealing all six of them at the same time could the formation be temporarily sealed.</p><p>After sealing this formation, they would be able to pass through this area.</p><p>However, the six formation eyes had to be sealed at the same time, and the time couldn’t be one minute apart.</p><p>Originally, with the experts that LAN Feng had brought last time, it would have been very easy to do this.</p><p>However, under the ground of this area, there was still a terrifying ghostly being. This ghostly being’s strength was terrifyingly powerful. It was at least divine Lord realm combat strength.</p><p>As long as a living being older than a certain age entered, it would attract the living beings that lived underground to attack.</p><p>However, if the younger generation were to enter, it would not attract such creatures.</p><p>Last time, LAN Feng’s group had suffered the greatest losses here. Many experts had died here, and they had also fled in a sorry state.</p><p>Therefore, he had borrowed some Young heaven’s favorites from the nine extremes Heavenly King to break this array.</p><p>The young geniuses went in and found the six array cores. Then, they just had to pass the news to each other and seal the array cores at the same time.</p><p>“You guys, come in with me!”</p><p>LAN Feng looked at all the young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>LAN Feng took the lead, and everyone rushed forward to the edge of the black fog area.</p><p>LAN Feng himself, the LAN family’s heaven’s pride experts he brought along, and the heaven’s pride experts of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, there were about a hundred people.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally one of them.</p><p>He could feel a cold aura passing by him from time to time.</p><p>“It seems like we’re going to make a move here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Upon entering this area, there was black fog everywhere. Everyone’s vision was blocked. Lu Ming guessed that LAN Feng would kill him here and take the divine power Pearl from him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, follow me!” He said.</p><p>As expected, LAN Feng looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not seem to notice the danger and nodded casually.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>&Nbsp; LAN Feng opened his mouth and charged into the black mist first, the others following.</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the black fog area, they felt the world spin. When they looked back, they could no longer see the experts outside.</p><p>They had already entered the range of the great formation.</p><p>let’s split up into six groups and search for the six formation’s eyes. Once we’ve found them, we’ll use the voice transmission jade talisman to inform them and seal all six of them at the same time!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and split into groups.</p><p>There were more paragons in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and they were divided into four groups.</p><p>The LAN family’s young geniuses were divided into two groups.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, the heaven’s favorites all flew in different directions and disappeared into the black mist.</p><p>At the scene, only LAN Feng’s group was left. Of course, Lu Ming was also left.</p><p>A total of ten people.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly looked behind LAN Feng with a frightened expression.</p><p>LAN Feng and the others were shocked and quickly looked behind, ready for a big battle. But when they turned around, there was nothing behind them.</p><p>“Not good, I’ve been tricked!”</p><p>An idea popped up in LAN Feng’s mind. He quickly turned around and saw Lu Ming’s figure dashing in one direction like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>“Damn it, he wants to leave? go after him and kill him!”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted angrily.</p><p>Just now, after the others had left, LAN Feng was about to take action against Lu Ming. He did not expect that Lu Ming would take action before him. He was distracted and escaped.</p><p>LAN Feng led the eight LAN family geniuses and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“LAN Feng, I knew you had bad intentions!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly when he saw LAN Feng chasing after him.</p><p>stop right there! Hand over the divine power origin bead and swear fealty to me, and I’ll spare your life!</p><p>LAN Feng shouted angrily.</p><p>“Are you daydreaming?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. At the same time, he pushed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to its limits and rushed forward.</p><p>“You think you can escape?”</p><p>LAN Feng’s voice was cold. He turned into a beam of sword light and broke through the black mist. His speed was shockingly fast, even faster than Lu Ming. He left the other eight youths of the LAN family far behind.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming had left early, it was not easy for LAN Feng to catch up with him.</p><p>One chased, one fled, and in the blink of an eye, they had flown hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>“You can’t escape. When I catch you, I’ll make you die without a burial place!”</p><p>LAN Feng’s voice was extremely cold, and his eyes were ferocious.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with LAN Feng. He moved forward with all his might.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically at the next moment.</p><p>A group of people had appeared in front of them. There were more than ten of them, and they were rushing over.</p><p>This group of people were also the LAN family’s geniuses.</p><p>The LAN family had been divided into two groups. The other group had already left before Lu Ming took action.</p><p>It was obvious that LAN Feng had sent a message to these people when they were pursuing Lu Ming. That was why they appeared in front to block Lu Ming.</p><p>Among the LAN family’s geniuses, there were also some who were extremely powerful. Their cultivation bases were at the first level of Divine King realm and above. Powerful auras surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to escape.”</p><p>LAN Feng’s face was ferocious.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>In front of him, more than a dozen paragons slashed out more than a dozen sword gleams at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Bolts of lightning suddenly appeared on his fist.</p><p>It was QiuQiu.</p><p>Although QiuQiu’s cultivation level was high, it was actually not that old. It was also part of the younger generation, so it could naturally enter this place.</p><p>Bolts of lightning burst out and bombarded the sword lights. In an instant, more than a dozen sword lights were shattered, and the lightning struck the bodies of those young men.</p><p>‘</p><p>Screams rang out. At least half of the dozen youths were killed by the lightning, while the other half were all forced back. Their bodies were charred black and their auras were weak.</p><p>QiuQiu’s current strength could even kill a fourth-tier Divine King existence, let alone a young prodigy.</p><p>Although these Young heaven’s pride experts were all powerful and far exceeded those of the same level, their cultivation was not very deep. How could they block QiuQiu’s attack?</p><p>“Ah, I’m going to kill you …”</p><p>Seeing that more than half of the young heaven’s pride experts were killed in an instant, LAN Feng’s eyes turned red and he let out an angry roar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying sword light burst out from between his eyebrows and slashed at Lu Ming at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had killed and repelled more than ten LAN family’s geniuses, his speed was also slightly hindered. This allowed LAN Feng to close in on him.</p><p>Therefore, the sword directly enveloped Lu Ming in a vast sword power.</p><p>LAN Feng’s furious attack was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current ability, he could not block it at all. He could only rely on QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu wriggled rapidly and transformed into a suit of armor, wrapping Lu Ming up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
