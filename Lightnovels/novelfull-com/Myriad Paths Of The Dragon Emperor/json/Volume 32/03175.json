Otherwise, even with the energy of a star’s core, I would need at least a few hundred years to break through to the ninth level celestial deity realm!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered to himself. He was eager to get more Yin treasures.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and muttered to himself. He then charged towards the ghost king on this level.</p><p>Not long after, a battle officially began.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had broken through to the ninth-tier celestial deity realm, the degree of awakening of his various divine-grade divine powers had also increased by quite a bit. His overall combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming activated the battle formula and increased his combat power by fivefold. He cast the master’s door and finally defeated the Army of ghost kings. In the end, he killed the ghost king on this level.</p><p>Here, Lu Ming obtained two crystals that contained ultimate Yin Qi.</p><p>After the ” quantity ” formula swallowed the crystal, Lu Ming entered the fifteenth level.</p><p>Outside, the dark ape battle clan had already become numb to this scene.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Lu Ming could make it this far. They wanted to see what other miracles Lu Ming could create next.</p><p>The ghosts on the 15th floor were undoubtedly stronger, especially the ghost king.</p><p>He was at the second level of the divine King realm, but he had awakened the divine power factor twice.</p><p>Lu Ming was no longer a match for this level of ability.</p><p>After all, the difference between each level of the heavenly God Realm was not as great as the divine King realm. Although he had advanced by one level, it was impossible for the degree of improvement to be as great as the advancement of one level in the divine King realm.</p><p>It did not improve as much as the awakening of the origin divine power factor. In this battle, Lu Ming was injured. After an intense battle, Lu Ming broke through the siege.</p><p>“If I want to defeat this ghost king, I’ll have to make another breakthrough in my cultivation, or have more types of divine power and awaken the origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Lu Ming analyzed his own situation.</p><p>Along the way, the ” quantity ” formula had absorbed a large number of Yin building blocks and a few of those crystals. It had fused with a portion of the energy from the star core for Lu Ming to absorb. However, the ultimate Yin treasure had not been completely refined. There was still some left that were continuously neutralizing the energy from the star core.</p><p>However, to break through to the half-step Divine King realm required more energy. It was not easy to do so in a short time.</p><p>Also, the comprehension of divine power could not be achieved overnight. Lu Ming had made plans to cultivate for a long time.</p><p>“Let’s continue!”</p><p>After Lu Ming recovered to his peak, he charged at the ghost king again.</p><p>After a huge battle, Lu Ming retreated.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming devoted himself to cultivation, training, and killing.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time. Time passed day by day and year by year.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had been 120 years since Lu Ming entered the eighteen levels of hell.</p><p>In total, it had been 120 years. There were less than 60 years left until the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged on a stone pillar, suddenly opened his eyes. A thick, ancient aura emanated from his body.</p><p>the Overlord Spear’s power has finally awakened the origin divine power factor!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>After so many years of cultivation, the Overlord Spear’s power had finally awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had a total of three types of divine power. He had awakened the origin divine power factor. They were the Dominator’s divine power, inextinguishable sword force, and Overlord spear force.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled a total of eight types of divine-grade divine energy, one type of sacred-grade divine energy, and one type of King-grade divine energy.</p><p>Other than these three types of divine power, the other five types of divine-grade divine power had all reached ninety-nine percent awakening.</p><p>Lu Ming had been constantly fighting for more than a hundred years. In the midst of fighting, he had to constantly circulate his divine power. Therefore, his understanding and application of divine power improved very quickly. That was why Lu Ming could reach this level in more than a hundred years.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. The spear trembled and pierced forward. A ray of spear light burst forth and flew thousands of miles in an instant, piercing a Divine King Zombie.</p><p>after the Overlord Spear’s power has awakened, the power of the long spear has indeed increased a lot!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Using a long spear was still the most compatible with the Overlord Spear’s power, and its power could be displayed better.</p><p>Moreover, in the past hundred years, Lu Ming’s improvement was not only in his divine power.</p><p>For example, all sorts of secret techniques and divine skills.</p><p>First of all, he had made great progress in the divine Dragon materialization art. Now, Lu Ming could condense 36 nine-clawed divine Dragons in one go.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming had cultivated the Wargod’s strike to the peak of the eighth stage. As long as he could break through to the ninth stage, its power would be comparable to the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had broken through to the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>In his body, the ten divine fires had disappeared and were replaced by ten divine power vortexes. The divine power in the vortexes had been condensed to the extreme.</p><p>As long as the ten divine power vortexes were completely crystallized and turned into star cores, he would officially step into the divine King realm.</p><p>Of course, this step was very, very difficult. Countless cultivators were stuck at this step, unable to improve.</p><p>His cultivation base had reached the half-step Divine King realm, and he had improved greatly in all aspects. Lu Ming’s strength could be said to have reached the peak.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still not satisfied. He could still improve because he had the divine power origin bead.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the divine power origin Pearl on the Overlord spear. From the Overlord Spear’s power, he would awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>The divine power Pearl appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. Without any hesitation, Lu Ming swallowed the divine power Pearl.</p><p>Once the divine power origin Pearl entered Lu Ming’s mouth, it flew toward his dantian under his control and fused with the Overlord Spear’s divine power vortex.</p><p>In an instant, the divine power origin bead melted and turned into a strange energy, completely merging into the Overlord spear force.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have entered a special state. He saw a shocking scene from the Overlord spear.</p><p>A long spear pierced through the starry sky of the universe. Stars exploded wherever the long spear passed, and a terrifying crack appeared in the starry sky of the universe.</p><p>The experts who stood in front of the spear were pierced and killed one by one.</p><p>It was powerful, terrifying, and overbearing.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be able to touch the long spear.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that this was the origin secret skill of the Overlord Spear’s power. He was highly focused as he quietly comprehended what he had just learned.</p><p>Time flew by, and more than ten days had passed.</p><p>“Spear of domination!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming growled. He clenched his right hand in the air and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>It seemed to be a stone spear, and it was filled with an ancient aura. It was filled with the traces of time, as if it had crossed through endless years.</p><p>This spear was exactly the same as the one that Lu Ming had seen earlier.</p><p>Origin secret skill!</p><p>This was the origin secret skill of the Overlord divine power, the tyrannical divine spear!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and thrust his spear forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
