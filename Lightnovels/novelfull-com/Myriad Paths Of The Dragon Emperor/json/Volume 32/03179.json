That is, your cultivation and the factor of divine power!</p><p>“You need to make a breakthrough in one of these two aspects before you can be confident.”</p><p>for example, your cultivation has reached the divine King realm, or your other divine-grade divine powers have awakened the divine power origin factor, or your ruler divine power has awakened for the second time!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. The grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy was not far away. How could he possibly break through in these few aspects in such a short time? any breakthrough would require a lot of time!</p><p>it’s less than 60 years before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. To be precise, it’s 56 years. Under normal circumstances, it’s impossible to achieve a breakthrough in any aspect within 56 years!</p><p>however, there are some peerless treasures that might allow you to break through in a short time!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>this kind of treasure is probably ridiculously expensive. How can it be so easy to obtain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Even if the nine absolute Heavenly Kings mansion doesn’t have it, it doesn’t mean that the great illusionary divine stage doesn’t have it!”</p><p>some of the powerful families in the great void Holy capital have some treasures that can help you break through. Hence, I plan to bring you to the great void Holy capital first. After all, the great void Royal sacred Academy is about to convene!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“To the great illusionary Holy capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up with a look of anticipation.</p><p>If the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was already so majestic, then how majestic would the great void Holy capital be?</p><p>Anyway, he would have to go to the great illusionary divine capital sooner or later.</p><p>back in the days when I was in the great illusionary divine capital, I was still doing pretty well. I also have a few friends that I’ve been through life and death with. I’ll go and beg them. They should be able to let you use those treasures to cultivate and break through your cultivation!</p><p>“Get ready, we’ll leave in two days!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>okay. By the way, uncle LAN, can I bring the others along? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You want to bring that girl with you, right? of course you can!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Many thanks, uncle LAN!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was indeed going to bring Qiu Yue along. With Qiu Yue’s talent, it should not be difficult for her to join the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>Cultivating in the great void Royal sacred Academy would allow Qiu Yue to improve faster.</p><p>He returned to his place of residence and told Qiu Yue about his plans to go to the great void Holy capital.</p><p>For the next two days, they didn’t cultivate and just enjoyed life quietly.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue to the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>Lu Ming saw an ordinary-looking young lady at the entrance of blue merchant courtyard.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>However, Lu Ming knew who she was when he saw the ordinary-looking woman’s expression.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The ordinary-looking lady snorted coldly when she saw Lu Ming. Her gaze turned even colder when she glanced at Qiu Yue.</p><p>Blue Spirit!</p><p>Needless to say, Lu Ming knew that this lady had an Indigo spirit.</p><p>It was obvious that LAN Ling had disguised herself.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that LAN Ling would definitely follow LAN Shang to the great void Holy capital. However, Wu Fan, the son of the state preceptor, had his eyes on LAN Ling. If LAN Ling went to the great void Holy capital with her real appearance, she would definitely encounter unnecessary trouble.</p><p>everyone’s here, ” LAN Shang said as he walked out of the courtyard. let’s go!</p><p>……</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was very far away from the great void Holy capital. They were separated by many star fields.</p><p>Even though they took the inter-star field teleportation array, it still took them a few years to reach the great void Holy capital.</p><p>“Is that the great illusionary Holy capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue stood in the starry sky, staring into the distance. Both of them were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even though he was mentally prepared, the great illusionary divine capital was beyond Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>In front of them, a giant city was floating in the universe.</p><p>Yes, it was a huge city.</p><p>It was a pitch-black, ancient giant city. It was shockingly huge, even bigger than a life planet.</p><p>A city that was bigger than a life planet, what kind of concept was this?</p><p>And around this giant city, there were many life planets that were constantly revolving around the giant city.</p><p>Lu Ming did a count. There were a total of thirty-six planets.</p><p>Thirty-six planets revolving around a giant city. This scene was truly too shocking.</p><p>“Hmph, you really haven’t seen the world!”</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s dumbfounded expressions, LAN Ling seized the opportunity to scoff coldly.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming completely ignored LAN Ling’s words.</p><p>He was now completely immune to Indigo spirits.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>LAN Shang looked at the great illusionary divine capital with a complicated expression. He said softly before flying towards the huge city.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them followed.</p><p>The closer they got to the giant city, the more they felt the magnificence of the city.</p><p>There were eight city gates in each direction of the city.</p><p>With all sorts of killing weapons on the city walls, it was definitely extremely terrifying.</p><p>Needless to say, there were definitely terrifying powerhouses keeping watch on the city walls.</p><p>If one wanted to enter the great illusionary Holy capital, they could only enter through those city gates.</p><p>Slowly, they flew towards one of the city gates.</p><p>“What a huge city gate!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The city gate was extremely huge, with a length and width of more than a million miles.</p><p>Even the larger races could easily pass through the city gates.</p><p>From afar, one could see countless living beings flying towards the city gate.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest lined up and flew toward the city gate with the crowd.</p><p>To enter the great illusionary Holy capital, one had to register their information and leave behind their life aura. This was very similar to entering the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Very soon, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>“Isn’t this the blue merchant?”</p><p>it’s really the blue merchant! He’s back!</p><p>“Why did he come back? Do we need to report it?”</p><p>“No need, his star core has been destroyed. He’s just a cripple, there’s no need to report!”</p><p>The soldiers who were guarding the city recognized LAN Shang and whispered among themselves.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>LAN Ling was unhappy and was about to fly into a rage but was stopped by LAN Shang.</p><p>“Register your information!”</p><p>LAN Shang said indifferently.</p><p>Ever since Jing Yu had fallen and his stellar core had been destroyed, he had heard this sort of mockery many times.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The guards laughed contemptuously and then registered LAN Shang and the others.</p><p>After registering, they passed through the city gates and entered the great illusionary Holy capital.</p><p>After entering the city gate, there were countless buildings.</p><p>There were all sorts of tall and ancient buildings, and they seemed to be endless.</p><p>The wide streets were a few thousand miles wide, and a large number of living beings were walking on them. It was extremely prosperous.</p><p>Many of the creatures exuded a terrifying aura. Lu Ming sensed it and was shocked.</p><p>God King, God King …</p><p>The streets were filled with God kings. The number of God kings was even greater than those below the God King realm.</p><p>How many godkings were there in the entire great void Holy capital?</p><p>the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy is getting closer and closer. Hence, powerful cultivators from all over the world have gathered here. That’s why there are so many godkings on the streets. Otherwise, even the great void Holy capital wouldn’t have so many godkings!</p><p>LAN Shang explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
