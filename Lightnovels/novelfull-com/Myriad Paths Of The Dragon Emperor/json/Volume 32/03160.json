It was the beating of the ancient God’s heart, like a drum.</p><p>Waves of energy flowed out of the ancient God’s heart and filled Lu Ming’s body, slowly strengthening his divine body.</p><p>The ancient God’s heart could absorb energy from the outside world at all times and then produce a strange energy that continuously strengthened Lu Ming’s divine body.</p><p>Although this speed was slow, after so many years of accumulation, Lu Ming’s divine body was far more powerful than ordinary people.</p><p>Most cultivators would have their divine bodies refined by divine power as their cultivation level increased.</p><p>Therefore, the higher one’s cultivation was, the stronger their divine body would be.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current divine body was at least on par with a fourth tier Divine King or the divine body of a fourth tier Divine King expert.</p><p>As a result, his life force was extremely vigorous, and his recovery speed was extremely fast.</p><p>LAN Feng seeped into the destructive sword intent in Lu Ming’s divine body, forcing out some tiny sword Qi.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>Tiny sword Qi flew out of Lu Ming’s body and shot into the ground, creating needle-sized holes.</p><p>After the tiny sword Qi was forced out, the wounds on Lu Ming’s body began to heal at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered and he was back to his peak condition.</p><p>At this moment, the black mist in the sky suddenly started to roll. A lot of the mist gathered towards the ground, as if it was being absorbed by the ground.</p><p>The mist floating in the air became thinner and thinner.</p><p>“Has the formation been sealed?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>It was very likely that LAN Feng and the others had already succeeded in sealing the four array cores.</p><p>Not long after, the black mist between heaven and earth disappeared without a trace. A boundless plain appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“I have to leave this place as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming roughly identified the direction and flew away quickly.</p><p>The great formation was sealed, and the experts that LAN Feng had brought could enter this place. If they were touched by those experts, then only death would await them.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s luck was not bad. He did not encounter anyone else. After flying for more than an hour, Lu Ming finally left the plain and arrived at a barren mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s intuition told him that he had completely left the area enveloped by the large array.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not feel at ease after arriving here. This was because there were all kinds of ghosts wandering around in this barren mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming saw specters, zombies, skeletons, red-haired zombies, and so on …</p><p>It was simply a gathering place for ghosts.</p><p>kid, let me teach you a method. You can also disguise your aura as a ghost …</p><p>Bone’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“Thank you, senior …”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming had initially planned to go around this area as he was going to look for the underworld ape combat clan. However, he had no idea where the underworld ape combat clan was. Hence, he could only try his luck by wandering around.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that most of the underworld ape war clan lived in the depths of the demon ghost. Therefore, he just had to keep going in the direction of the depths of the demon ghost.</p><p>However, if he could disguise his aura as a ghost’s aura, it would make his movements much more convenient.</p><p>Very soon, a piece of information was transmitted to Lu Ming’s mind. It was a secret skill that the bone demon had passed on to him.</p><p>Lu Ming was not surprised. The bone demon looked like a skeleton to begin with. It was normal for it to have such a secret skill.</p><p>This secret skill was just a little trick to conceal one’s aura. It was very easy to cultivate and Lu Ming understood it without much effort.</p><p>With a single thought, the secret skill was activated. The ghost Qi in the world gathered towards Lu Ming and covered his body.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming had a ghastly appearance.</p><p>This secret technique was actually very simple. It was to absorb the surrounding ghost Qi and hide one’s own aura.</p><p>It sounded very rough, but if it was a creature with high spiritual intelligence, it would be easy to recognize it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that the ghosts in the demon ghost had very low intelligence. This method was enough to fool them.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming flew forward. A few red-haired zombies passed by him and completely ignored him, treating him as one of them.</p><p>“Haha, you’re really good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in his heart and felt at ease. He sped up and rushed into the barren mountains.</p><p>As he advanced, not a single ghost attacked him.</p><p>The journey was smooth as they passed through the barren mountains and wilderness, and arrived at another area.</p><p>The area of the ghost domain was very large, and there were countless ghosts living there.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have a destination. He just followed his feelings and headed deep into the demon ghost.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming had no idea how far he had traveled, but he still could not find the nether ape combat clan.</p><p>“Where is the underworld ape battle clan? Don’t tell me they’ve all gone extinct after so many years!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered but then shook his head.</p><p>According to what LAN Shang had said, the nether ape battle clan was filled with experts. How could they be exterminated so easily?</p><p>Lu Ming could only be patient and continue to search.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming passed by a mountain range, a few roars came from the mountain range. Then, a few huge figures rushed towards Lu Ming, and a violent force pressed down on Lu Ming like a Gale.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He quickly retreated and took a closer look.</p><p>In front of him, there were three figures. Each of them was about two meters tall. Their bodies were black, their eyes were blood red, and their mouths revealed their fangs.</p><p>“This is the dark ape battle clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but be overjoyed.</p><p>Before he came in, LAN Shang had described the appearance of the nether ape combat clan to Lu Ming. It was extremely similar to the few people in front of him.</p><p>He had finally found the nether ape battle clan.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking at the other members of the dark ape combat clan, and they were also sizing him up.</p><p>“A human pretending to be a ghost? what do you want? What’s your purpose?”</p><p>One of the dark ape battle clan members spoke. His voice was filled with violence.</p><p>Clearly, the underworld ape war clan was not like other ghosts. They were very intelligent and could easily tell that Lu Ming was not a ghost, but a human.</p><p>“Everyone, are you the Warriors of the dark ape battle clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>“That’s right. What are you doing here, a human? Could it be that the great void Holy dynasty sent you here to investigate the situation of my underworld ape battle clan?”</p><p>One of the dark ape battle clan’s members spoke in a cold voice as a cold killing intent exuded from his body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The other two nether ape battle clan members also exuded powerful auras.</p><p>Half-step Divine King!</p><p>These three nether ape battle clan members were all half-step divine kings.</p><p>“You’ve all misunderstood. To be honest, I’m Jing Yu’s successor!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming directly revealed his identity.</p><p>“War ancestor Jingyu? You’re saying that you’re war ancestor shockfeather’s successor?”</p><p>The three dark ape battle clan warriors exclaimed in shock.</p><p>“So the nether ape battle clan calls Prince Jing Yu the war ancestor?” Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded immediately.</p><p>“Kid, do you have any evidence? If you don’t have any evidence to back up your claims, the consequences will be dire!”</p><p>A dark ape battle clan member said in a cold voice. In addition to that, his appearance was extremely malevolent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
