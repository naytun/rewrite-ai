He didn’t take long to pass the eighth level. This means that the ordinary ghosts on the eighth level can’t trap him at all. I’m afraid his strength is stronger than we thought!</p><p>that’s right. It might not be a bad thing if we can pass the ninth level and complete the assessment!</p><p>At this moment, many of the nether ape war clan members were hoping that Lu Ming would be able to pass the ninth level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was evident from the fact that he had passed the ninth level.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s talent, the nether ape combat clan might become even stronger in the future if they followed him.</p><p>On the ninth level of the eighteen levels of hell, Lu Ming was also besieged by a large number of ghosts.</p><p>The ghosts on this floor were a type of zombie. Their bodies were as hard as iron, and their defense and strength were amazing. They were not afraid of death and were very difficult to kill.</p><p>Moreover, most of them were ninth level heavenly deities, and there were even quite a few half-step divine kings.</p><p>Surrounded by a large number of such zombies, it was not easy to break out of the encirclement, let alone find the Zombie King.</p><p>Moreover, killing these zombies consumed a lot of Shen power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear. The Spear’s radiance was like a mountain, pressing down on the zombies. The zombies were sent flying like cannonballs and fell into a pile of meat.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming became one with his spear and turned into a dazzling spear ray. He soared into the sky and forcefully carved out a bloody path before flying into the distance.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>On the ground, countless zombies howled and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>there are so many zombies. If I continue to be entangled by so many zombies, I’m afraid my divine power will be exhausted very quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression finally turned serious.</p><p>He was not afraid of the power of these zombies as they could be easily killed, but there were too many of them. If this continued, even if he had the quantity formula to store a large amount of Shen power, it would be used up sooner or later.</p><p>given the difficulty of the task, there should be a place for us to rest and recover!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>If there was no place to regulate his breathing and recover, Lu Ming did not believe that anyone could do it. It could only be done by an expert who was much more powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming killed his way through and opened up a bloody path. He then randomly chose a direction and flew.</p><p>After fighting for a few hours, Lu Ming’s own divine energy was almost exhausted. He could only use his divine energy from the quantity formula.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw a huge stone pillar standing between the sky and the earth.</p><p>On the ground, a stone pillar suddenly appeared, which was very abrupt.</p><p>It was definitely not ordinary.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered a few times. He then flew to the stone pillar and landed on it.</p><p>The strange thing was that when Lu Ming landed on the stone pillar, the zombies that were chasing him suddenly stopped. They looked left and right, as if they had lost track of Lu Ming. After wandering around for a while, the zombies left one after another, disappearing on the ground.</p><p>They all left.</p><p>“It’s indeed useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>It seemed that this stone pillar was for people to rest and recover. Otherwise, not many people would be able to resist so many zombies, and their divine power would be exhausted sooner or later.</p><p>With this kind of place to rest, he could recover his Shen power at ease and then slowly search for the Zombie King.</p><p>But Speaking of which, the difficulty of this ninth level was also much harder than the previous levels.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and slowly recovered.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming set off again.</p><p>However, when he was not far from the stone pillar, he was surrounded by a large number of zombies.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fight the zombies. He flew as he fought.</p><p>After dashing out for a long distance, Lu Ming discovered another stone pillar.</p><p>It was obvious that there was a stone pillar at every set distance in the eighth level of hell.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the stone pillar. The zombies had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming walked and stopped. It took him three years to find the place where the Zombie King was. It was a zombie cave with a large number of zombies.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived at the zombie cave when an angry roar came from the cave. Then, a large number of zombies rushed out.</p><p>The strength of this Zombie Army was clearly stronger than the zombies scattered in other places.</p><p>Most of them were half-step Divine King zombies, and there were more than three hundred of them.</p><p>The three hundred half-step Divine King zombies were impenetrable. Their bodies were as hard as divine weapons. They roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>After the three hundred half-step Divine King zombies rushed out, a golden-furred zombie walked out of the zombie cave.</p><p>This zombie was burly and three meters tall, emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>“Zombie King!”</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that this was the Zombie King.</p><p>Lu Ming had yet to charge into the zombie cave when the Zombie King led his Army out of the cave.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>ancient God! Lu Ming shouted. His body began to expand rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>After transforming into a green-armored ancient God, Lu Ming’s combat power increased dramatically. His huge spear was like a mountain range, smashing toward the zombies.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current strength as a green-armored ancient God, how could these half-step Divine King zombies be his match?</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The zombies exploded one after another, dying on the spot.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming to finish off the three hundred half-step Divine King zombies.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Zombie King let out an angry roar and charged at Lu Ming like a golden bolt of lightning. Its long sharp claws were like blades as it slashed at Lu Ming with a terrifying howl.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and swept it out to meet the attack.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of a violent collision was heard. The long spear vibrated non-stop. Lu Ming felt a strong force surging towards him. He could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>As for the Zombie King, his body also retreated.</p><p>what a shocking power! This Zombie King’s strength is probably comparable to Yuan Yu’s!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The Zombie King was equivalent to a first tier Godking who had awakened the godly power factor twice. In this aspect, he was on par with Yuan Yu. In addition, the Zombie King was extremely tough, powerful, and unafraid of death. His overall strength was not weaker than Yuan Yu’s.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was a seventh-level celestial deity, he was not Yuan Yu’s match without using the door of Masters.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the eighth level celestial deity realm, he could have a contest.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Zombie King became even more furious when it saw that it could not kill Lu Ming with one move. It continued to pounce at Lu Ming, its sharp claws like blades, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and charged at the Zombie King.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cast the door of domination. The Zombie King was a very good opponent to train with. He could use it to train his various secret skills and divine skills.</p><p>Lu Ming used the divine Dragon materialization technique, the yin-yang divine eyes, and the three apocalyptic strikes to fight the Zombie King.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had many tricks up his sleeve, he was actually at a slight disadvantage after dozens of moves.</p><p>Lu Ming still did not cast the door of domination and continued to fight the Zombie King.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
