Countless tiny lightning bolts gathered together, turning into a thick bolt of lightning that blasted towards LAN Feng’s sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning and the sword radiance collided. The two of them shook violently, but it was obvious that the sword radiance was more powerful.</p><p>The sword gleam shone brightly, forcing the lightning back. After a few explosions, the lightning was shattered and the remaining sword gleam slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force coming at him. It was extremely sharp. His body shook violently and he flew out like a cannonball, drawing a Long Gully on the ground.</p><p>Waves of piercing pain spread throughout his body. Lu Ming felt that his bones were about to break. A crack appeared on the armor that QiuQiu had transformed into.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>QiuQiu’s cultivation was now at the third level of the divine King realm, and its combat strength was even more powerful. It could kill a fourth level Divine King existence.</p><p>But in the attack just now, QiuQiu was completely no match for LAN Feng. It had even turned into armor, but it was still broken by LAN Feng.</p><p>Fortunately, QiuQiu had transformed into an armor to block the other party’s attack. Otherwise, Lu Ming would have died.</p><p>“Metallic lifeform? Hmph, do you think a third level Godking metallic lifeform can stop me? Kill!”</p><p>die! LAN Feng shouted. His body was like a sword light. In a flash, he rushed toward Lu Ming and slashed again.</p><p>The sword light was vast and mighty. The surrounding black fog rolled violently and let out a terrifying whistling sound. Needless to say, its power was shocking.</p><p>“The door of a sovereign!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming growled and circulated his divine energy crazily. The door of domination appeared above his head.</p><p>The ancient gate of domination emitted an ancient aura and crashed toward the sword light.</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu once again displayed its might. Endless lightning condensed into a long spear, blasting towards LAN Feng.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword-light was the first to strike the door of domination.</p><p>The door of domination shook crazily and then exploded.</p><p>This was within Lu Ming’s expectations. Although the door of domination was an origin secret skill and was powerful, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too low. The difference between him and LAN Feng was too great. He would definitely not be able to block LAN Feng’s attack.</p><p>Following that, the lightning Spear also collided with the sword radiance.</p><p>This time, it was first blocked by the door of domination and then hit by the long spear formed by lightning. The power of the sword gleam was greatly offset. The remaining power struck Lu Ming. Although Lu Ming was sent flying, he was not injured.</p><p>the origin secret skill! You’ve actually comprehended the origin secret skill!</p><p>LAN Feng recognized Lu Ming’s origin secret skill and shouted in shock.</p><p>Then, LAN Feng’s eyes widened, revealing a crazy killing intent, and he roared,”You ate a divine power source Pearl. Damn it, you piece of trash ate a divine power source Pearl. You waste a heavenly treasure. How can a divine power source Pearl be wasted on a piece of trash like you? argh, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>LAN Feng screamed hysterically, her eyes red, revealing a look of jealousy.</p><p>In his opinion, it was impossible for Lu Ming to have awakened the origin secret skill on his own. He must have eaten the divine power Pearl.</p><p>In his heart, a treasure like the divine power origin Pearl should be used by him. It was a waste and a waste for Lu Ming to eat it.</p><p>At this moment, his killing intent towards Lu Ming was extremely strong.</p><p>He was so angry that he almost vomited blood at the thought of losing the divine power source Pearl that could help him awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>die! LAN Feng roared. The sword radiance soared into the sky and beams of terrifying sword radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged forward. As he charged forward, he cast his techniques to block LAN Feng’s attacks.</p><p>However, the difference between Lu Ming’s ability and LAN Feng’s was too great. Even with QiuQiu, there was still a huge gap. They were not his match at all and could not even escape.</p><p>In less than five minutes, Lu Ming had to face six sword beams from LAN Feng. Even with QiuQiu protecting him, Lu Ming was almost cut in half. Two sword wounds appeared on his body. The terrifying destructive sword intent kept drilling into the depths of his body, causing Lu Ming to vomit blood. He was seriously injured.</p><p>“What do we do? If this continues, I’ll die at the hands of the other party sooner or later!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly as he thought of countermeasures.</p><p>“Brat, we can only take a risk now!”</p><p>The bone Devil’s voice echoed in his mind.</p><p>“Bone, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s a terrifying existence living underground in this area. We can only escape if we take the risk to attract the terrifying existence underground!</p><p>your auras can’t attract these existences. So, only a trace of my aura can attract them!</p><p>Bone explained.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s take a gamble!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>be careful. If there’s any movement, run!</p><p>The bone Devil reminded him cautiously and released a wisp of aura.</p><p>The bone Devil was an old monster that had lived for who knew how many years. As soon as a wisp of its aura was released, it was sensed by the terrifying existence underground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely terrifying aura suddenly spread out from the depths of the ground.</p><p>It was only a wisp of aura, but Lu Ming felt as if countless mountains were pressing down on him, almost kneeling down.</p><p>And LAN Feng’s expression changed even more.</p><p>“Damn it, why is the existence underground disturbed? Run, run …”</p><p>LAN Feng was almost scared to death. He could not be bothered to continue chasing Lu Ming. He screamed and jumped tens of meters high. He turned around and fled, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>No wonder LAN Feng was scared to death.</p><p>The existences underground were too terrifying. They were at least terrifying existences in the divine Lord realm. If they appeared, they could blow him to death in one breath. It would be strange if he didn’t run.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go quickly!”</p><p>At this moment, bone demon also roared and quickly concealed his aura.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, was running at full speed.</p><p>Deep underground, there seemed to be a wave of spiritual sense spreading out and sweeping across Lu Ming and LAN Feng.</p><p>The two of them tensed up and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>Fortunately, the spiritual consciousness seemed to have ignored them. After scanning the area, it retracted. The terrifying aura underground also disappeared.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath. It was too terrifying just now. Lu Ming’s heart was almost in his throat.</p><p>If that kind of existence really crawled out, Lu Ming would die without a doubt.</p><p>At this moment, he relaxed and immediately felt cold sweat all over his body.</p><p>“I’ve finally gotten rid of that fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled in a low voice. He then exerted all his strength and ran forward.</p><p>This area was enveloped by a large formation. Lu Ming did not know how far he had run, but he was still in the large formation. He was surrounded by black fog and it was difficult to get out.</p><p>“Let’s just wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled. He then found a place to sit down and started to circulate the universe thousand Dao Scripture to heal his injuries.</p><p>When he fought with LAN Feng earlier, his injuries were still quite serious. If he didn’t treat his injuries in time, it would have a great impact on his Foundation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
