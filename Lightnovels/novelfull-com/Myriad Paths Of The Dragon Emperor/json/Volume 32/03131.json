We’re in luck. If we kill him, the Heavenly King will reward us handsomely!</p><p>A few heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion said. They looked ferocious and excited.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion flew toward Lu Ming at high speed. They formed an arc and surrounded Lu Ming, locking their cold auras onto him.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming dared to escape, they would launch a thunderous attack.</p><p>“Leave this brat to me. My battle with him back then isn’t over yet!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, a young man with a blade on his back stepped out, and his violent aura soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally recognized this young man. He was the one who wanted to challenge Lu Ming after he defeated two conquerors from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion in the Heavenly Kings District.</p><p>This person was an existence who had awakened the origin divine power factor. However, before he could fight with Lu Ming, the third Prince, Jiu juemu, had arrived and stopped the battle.</p><p>Now that he had encountered Lu Ming, the person was naturally the first to step forward and kill Lu Ming with his own hands.</p><p>“Kid, now that there’s no one to stop you, I’d like to see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>you’re courting death! the saber-carrying youth said coldly. A saber-light soared into the sky, and a vast saber power spread in all directions.</p><p>“Cut the crap and make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit. A long spear appeared in his hand. With the infusion of divine power, the long spear buzzed and vibrated.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming triggered the fourfold combat power of the battle character formula and his aura was imposing.</p><p>“Kid, remember, the one who killed you is Duan Jiang!”</p><p>die! the saber-carrying teenager shouted coldly. Then, a huge Spear’s gleam burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The blade ray pressed down for thousands of miles, bringing with it violent Qi. Its power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and brandished his long spear, slashing out with all his might. A crescent-shaped spearlight was slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the saber radiance collided heavily, stirring up a monstrous wave of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a strong surge of energy surging towards him and his figure drifted backward. Duan Jiang’s figure also swayed slightly.</p><p>use your full strength. You’re still far from being able to deal with me with this kind of strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s disdainful voice was heard.</p><p>“Presumptuous! Heaven splitting saber, cut!”</p><p>die! Duan Jiang shouted as he unsheathed the saber on his back. A shocking Saber Light burst forth, incomparably bright and blinding.</p><p>The heaven splitting saber could split the sky. It slashed at Lu Ming with unparalleled momentum.</p><p>The power of this blade was several times stronger than the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He felt a sense of danger from this slash.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An ancient roar came from Lu Ming’s mouth. His body grew rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>After transforming into a green-armored ancient God, Lu Ming’s strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>Weng ~!</p><p>The long spear trembled and swept out horizontally. The long spear rapidly grew in size, and like a mountain range, it rumbled toward Duan Jiang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The second collision between the two of them created a shockwave that swept across tens of thousands of miles. Mountains were blown away and shattered into pieces.</p><p>The long spear and the blade radiance shook continuously. After a few breaths, the blade radiance shook violently and then shattered.</p><p>A berserk force gushed toward Duan Jiang, causing him to be sent flying backward.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure also swayed and he retreated a few steps. However, the distance he retreated was shorter than Duan Jiang.</p><p>“A Godking who has awakened the origin divine power factor is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh in his heart.</p><p>Although he hadn’t used his strongest move just now, he had almost used his full strength, but he had only gained a slight advantage.</p><p>One had to know that he could easily crush those at the first level of the divine King realm who had not awakened the origin divine power factor and controlled divine-grade divine power.</p><p>It could only be said that prodigies who had awakened the origin divine power factor were much stronger than those who had not.</p><p>Although two of Lu Ming’s divine powers had awakened the origin divine power factor, it was not enough. It was difficult to make up for the gap. He could only rely on the battle character formula and the ancient God Body to make up for it.</p><p>Unless Lu Ming awakened the origin divine power factor in five to seven types of divine powers, he could not make up for the gap.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too low.</p><p>He had similarly awakened the divine power factor, so how could he, a seventh level heavenly God, be on par with a first level Divine King?</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in surprise, but he did not know how shocked Duan Jiang and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon were. They were simply horrified.</p><p>how is that possible? he’s only a seventh level celestial deity. How can he possibly have such strength? ”</p><p>Duan Jiang roared in his heart, finding it difficult to remain calm.</p><p>A seventh level celestial deity was actually able to suppress him slightly. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>Even the so-called strongest prodigy in the history of the war god clan, the peerless genius who could lead the war god clan to its revival, couldn’t be this strong, right?</p><p>“I don’t believe it. Kill, kill!”</p><p>die! Duan Jiang shouted, pushing his divine power to the extreme and performing a terrifying secret skill. He slashed out with his saber.</p><p>His saber gleams turned into ferocious Tigers that charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He charged forward with his gun and launched a counterattack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows in mid-air. At first, Duan Jiang could still fight fiercely with Lu Ming. However, after a dozen moves, Duan Jiang was no longer his match. He was at a disadvantage and was constantly retreating.</p><p>Outside the array, countless people were dumbfounded when they saw this.</p><p>These people were all shocked by Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Nine blades Heavenly King muttered, unable to hide the shock in his eyes.</p><p>Even the nine blade Heavenly King was like this, let alone the others.</p><p>The Masters of the Jin family, the Yiren family, and the others looked extremely gloomy. They were secretly praying that the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Duan Jiang, today’s not the time for a one-on-one fight. The top priority is to kill this brat!”</p><p>Another heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion said coldly.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s join forces to kill him, lest a long night brings trouble!</p><p>The other paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion also chimed in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Wuwuwuwu …</p><p>Then, he unsheathed his saber, and the saber radiance stirred the void.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted, changed his direction, and thrust his spear at the Paragon of the residence of Heavenly King Nine blades.</p><p>Although he was fighting Duan Jiang, he knew the movements of the other members of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion like the back of his hand.</p><p>The other party wanted to join forces to besiege him, so he made a prompt decision to strike first. He directly used his strongest move, star explosion!</p><p>The huge spear light rushed toward the crowd of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion and then exploded, forming a wave of destructive Qi that swept toward the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Not good, retreat …”</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King residence did not expect Lu Ming to react so quickly. They had not even made a move, and Lu Ming had already launched a counterattack. They were shocked. Some retreated while others used techniques to block.</p><p>However, given Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, the ‘star explosion’ was so terrifying that ordinary people could not block it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
