A fist force as large as a mountain crushed toward the old man.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wu Shan had the cultivation base of the third level of King God Realm. He was not someone that the old man could resist. The fist force blasted over and the old man exploded into ashes.</p><p>“You … You dare to kill my cold dawn sect’s people, you’re courting death!”</p><p>“Send the signal!”</p><p>The remaining few people were shocked and furious. One of them let out a long roar, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, figures flew out from the Han family’s core area.</p><p>There were at least twenty of them. Each of them had powerful Qi. They were all experts and all of them were divine kings.</p><p>.com</p><p>The cold dawn sect was a power second only to the Han clan and the wind moon sect. It was even more powerful than the Qin heaven star system’s ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The moment they moved out, it was over twenty God kings.</p><p>Soon, the twenty-odd people arrived.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>A young man in his 20s asked gloomily while waving a folding fan with a cold expression.</p><p>“They killed protector Wang!”</p><p>One of the people from before pointed at Lu Ming and the rest and shouted.</p><p>“What? Protector Wang is dead? You’re looking for death!” The young man bellowed in anger. He swept his gaze towards Lu Ming and the rest, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>However, when his gaze fell on Han Ying, he was stunned for a moment and revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>“Han Ying, it’s you! You didn’t die!”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>sun Nian, How dare you! Why did you bring your men to occupy the Han family’s core area? ”</p><p>Han Ying scolded.</p><p>So they knew each other.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites from the chutian star field, so it was normal for them to know each other.</p><p>The cold-looking young man, sun Nian’s eyes flashed, then he laughed out loud.”Hahaha, Han Ying, do you still think you’re the heiress of the Han family? Now that the Han clan has been annihilated and all the experts are dead, my cold dawn sect is the boss of chutian star field. Do you understand?”</p><p>At this point, sun Nian’s gaze swept across Han Ying. His eyes were burning with passion and flickered with an evil light. in the past, I pursued you bitterly, but you didn’t even spare me a glance. Hehehe, now that the Han family has been destroyed, let’s see who you can rely on.</p><p>“Good, good, it’s great that you didn’t die. I’ll take you down and make you my toy. Let’s see how arrogant you can be then. Hahaha!”</p><p>Sun Nian laughed heartily. The more she spoke, the more fiery her eyes became.</p><p>“You … You dare to …”</p><p>Han Ying’s face turned pale.</p><p>where did this idiot come from? why are you shouting here? get lost!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and cast a nonchalant glance at sun Nian as he berated her.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Sun Nian acknowledged his words and only noticed Lu Ming now. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he looked at Lu Ming.”Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>“You can’t hear what I’m saying, it seems like your hearing isn’t good either!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>you, are you looking for death? men, kill him for me. No, cripple him. I want to feed him to the dogs!</p><p>Sun Nian shouted coldly, his killing intent as sharp as a blade.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was just Han Ying’s Lackey. He might be a young man who survived the Han family.</p><p>Now that the Han family had been annihilated, Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in such a manner. He was simply courting death. Previously, he had been suppressed by the Han family. The anger that he had been suppressing exploded out.</p><p>“Young master, leave it to me!”</p><p>A skinny man stepped out from behind sun Nian and swiped his claw at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>The young man was a first level God King. In his opinion, Lu Ming was only a God. It would be a piece of cake for him to cripple Lu Ming. In fact, he had not even used his full strength in this attack.</p><p>a servant of a wild dog dares to bark. Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. A long spear appeared in his hand. The battle formula multiplied his combat power by four times and he thrust his spear at his opponent.</p><p>The spear light was as dazzling as a shooting star as it stabbed toward the skinny man at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through the skinny man’s palm easily as if it was tofu, leaving a bloody hole.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Thin Man screamed and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Although he didn’t use his full strength, he was still a first tier Divine King. He was shocked and incredulous that he was injured by a heavenly God.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>After Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the skinny man’s palm, he continued to attack. The nine types of divine power in his body exploded.</p><p>The nine types of divine power, with the ruler’s divine power, which had awakened the origin divine power factor, as the core, rushed into the spear and exploded in an instant, forming a terrifying power.</p><p>The crowd only saw a crescent-shaped flash. Then, they saw the skinny man’s body split into two.</p><p>Two moves to kill a Godking!</p><p>Before Lu Ming had transformed into the ancient God Body, he could not have killed a Divine King so easily. However, the divine King had underestimated him. Lu Ming seized the opportunity and killed him in one fell swoop.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Sun Nian was also stunned. She looked at Lu Ming with her mouth agape.</p><p>A heavenly God could actually kill a God King. He had never even heard of such a thing. For a moment, his mind was completely blank.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, then die!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and his long spear trembled. It turned into a dazzling spear radiance and shot toward sun Nian.</p><p>“Young master, be careful!”</p><p>Behind sun Nian, an elder roared. A surge of divine power gushed out and sucked sun Nian’s body behind him. Then, he sent a palm strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The old man’s palm struck Lu Ming’s long spear, causing a loud boom. Lu Ming’s long spear trembled violently, and he was sent flying backward by a powerful force. He felt his qi and blood churning, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill, kill this bastard!”</p><p>Sun Nian reacted and roared madly.</p><p>Just now, he was almost killed by Lu Ming. He broke out in cold sweat and was filled with fear.</p><p>This kind of feeling made him a little hysterical.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“You guys are dead!”</p><p>Behind sun Nian, the experts roared. Violent auras burst forth and they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With so many experts, their aura was shocking, causing Han Ying’s face to pale.</p><p>Wu Shan’s aura also exploded, ready to attack.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard. Then, QiuQiu squirmed and turned into an armor, covering Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Bolts of lightning emanated from the armor, making Lu Ming look like a Mighty God of War.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a huge bolt of lightning, thicker than a human waist, rushed forward.</p><p>The attacks that were aimed at Lu Ming were struck by the lightning and crumbled.</p><p>The lightning didn’t stop and continued to bombard the cold dawn sect’s experts.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Like balloons that had been punctured, the experts of the cold dawn sect were unable to withstand a single blow from the lightning. They exploded one after another and turned into ashes under the power of the lightning.</p><p>All of a sudden, at least a dozen first, second, and even third level Divine King realm experts were turned into ashes, completely disappearing from the world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
