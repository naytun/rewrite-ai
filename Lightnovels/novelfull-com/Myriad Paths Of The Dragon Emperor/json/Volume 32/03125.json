Once he obtained the divine power Pearl and comprehended the origin divine power, his strength would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>At that time, when the great void Royal sacred Academy held a meeting, they would be able to shock the world with a single brilliant feat. They would be able to suppress all the outstanding heroes and obtain an extremely high position. This would be of great importance to their future.</p><p>It would be strange if he wasn’t tempted.</p><p>“Nine blades, I didn’t expect you to be willing to spend so much!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘face was dark.</p><p>“I have no choice but to take revenge for what happened back then!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine blades sneered.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s eyes were cold. He already knew the nine sabers Heavenly King’s plan.</p><p>When they were young, the nine absolutes Heavenly King killed the nine blades Heavenly King’s younger brother. Both sides had a death feud, and the nine blades Heavenly King had always wanted to take revenge.</p><p>.com</p><p>For countless years, the two Heavenly King manors had been fighting each other.</p><p>Last time, Heavenly King Nine sabers had bribed sikong Nan and had him secretly help the dark ice Clan steal the nine absolute God crystal. His goal was to cause suspicion among the big families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and cause conflicts between the worlds. He wanted to cause a war between the big families and weaken the overall strength of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Once the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s strength was weakened to a certain extent, the nine saber Heavenly King could lead his Army and break through the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Unfortunately, their plan last time had been seen through, and it didn’t have the corresponding effect.</p><p>This time, the nine saber Heavenly King had the same goal.</p><p>Using the divine power source bead as a guide to let the great families fight for it. The divine power source bead was too precious. In order to fight for it, the geniuses would definitely fight with all their might. It was very normal to kill each other.</p><p>At that time, once many heaven’s favorites died, it would definitely aggravate the conflict between the families and lead to a war.</p><p>This was the nine saber Heavenly King’s plan.</p><p>“How do you want to proceed?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts asked.</p><p>it’s very simple. This time, I’ll set up a large formation. All the participating Supreme talents will enter the formation. I’ll place the divine power source Pearl on a puppet. The Supreme talents who enter the formation only need to seize the divine power source Pearl and stay in the formation for a month. After a month, the divine power source Pearl will belong to whoever still has the divine power source Pearl. No one else is allowed to snatch it. Otherwise, they’ll be my enemy!</p><p>of course, there’s a limit to the cultivation of the geniuses who can enter the formation. The highest cultivation level is at the first Firmament Godking realm, and the lowest cultivation level is not limited!</p><p>Nine blades Heavenly King explained the rules.</p><p>Some of the first level Godking geniuses had ugly expressions.</p><p>Those whose cultivation had exceeded the first tier of the Godking realm would lose their right to fight for the divine power origin bead.</p><p>“Nine blades, don’t go too far …”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts said with a dark expression.</p><p>With the nine sabers Heavenly King’s arrangement, it could be imagined that those heaven’s favorites who entered the formation would definitely have a fierce fight. When that time comes, the heaven’s favorites from the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s families would fight each other, and it might really cause conflict.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Jiujue, don’t you want the geniuses below you to fight for the divine power Pearl? do you want to take away their opportunities? If you have the ability, you should also take out a divine power source Pearl and give it to your subordinate!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts laughed coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was at a loss for words.</p><p>A divine power origin bead could only be found by chance. It was not something that could be obtained just because one had a high cultivation and status. He did not have one on him.</p><p>This wasn’t a scheme by the nine saber Heavenly King, but an open scheme. Even if he knew the other party’s purpose, he couldn’t refuse.</p><p>The moment he refused and did not allow the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to participate, these paragons would definitely have a lot of opinions. His deterrence would be greatly reduced.</p><p>The nine sabers Heavenly King sneered. He knew that the nine absolutes Heavenly King could only agree and not reject.</p><p>alright, since you’re willing to spend so much, nine blades, then the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion will accept this great gift of the divine power origin bead!</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>This made many heaven’s favorites excited.</p><p>alright, I’ll find a place to set up the formation. The competition will begin in seven days. Those who wish to participate, please register!</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion said.</p><p>With that said, the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s gaze swept around and finally landed on Lu Ming. A cold glint flashed in their eyes.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King spoke.</p><p>This surprised many people. The nine saber Heavenly King actually knew Lu Ming?</p><p>Being stared at by the nine saber Heavenly King, Lu Ming felt a chill all over his body. It was as if he was being stared at by an incomparably terrifying giant beast, as if he would be devoured at any moment.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed a great danger.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He said in a tone that was neither servile nor overbearing,”That’s right, I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>“Very good, heroes indeed come from the youth!”</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King smiled faintly. Then, he ignored Lu Ming and left with the people from the nine blades Heavenly King residence.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s eyes flickered. He took a step forward and left the place.</p><p>The scene, however, was in an uproar.</p><p>The news about the divine power origin bead spread like a storm throughout the entire nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, causing a huge commotion.</p><p>A divine power Pearl could allow a heaven’s favorite who had awakened the divine power source to become a true heaven’s favorite of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>This attraction was fatal.</p><p>Countless heaven’s favorites woke up from their cultivation and decided to participate in the competition.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to participate?”</p><p>Wu Ming asked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Naturally, I’ll participate!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although he had a feeling that he would be targeted by the nine blades Heavenly King mansion if he participated, he didn’t want to miss the divine power Pearl.</p><p>Once he got the divine power Pearl, he would be able to comprehend an origin secret skill, which would be of great help to him.</p><p>Not long after, the nine saber Heavenly King and the nine absolute Heavenly King Estate sent people to register. Those of the younger generation with a cultivation base of first level Divine King or below could participate in the competition.</p><p>For a time, people gathered to register.</p><p>Even some of the youths who did not have a high cultivation base were hoping to get lucky.</p><p>This was because, even though the fight for the divine power Pearl this time would depend on strength, it would also depend on luck.</p><p>If he was lucky enough to find a divine power source Pearl, he could find a place to hide. As long as he could hide for a month, the divine power source Pearl would be his.</p><p>It’s only a month, I’ll be able to get through it very quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming also went to register.</p><p>However, he did not let Qiu Yue sign up.</p><p>During this period of time, Qiu Yue had already touched the edge of the divine King realm and was currently in seclusion to break through to the divine King realm. He believed that she would succeed very soon.</p><p>After the registration, Lu Ming returned to his residence to cultivate and wait patiently.</p><p>Time flew by, and soon, seven days had passed.</p><p>Seven days later, countless heaven’s favorites gathered in the Heavenly King District.</p><p>Other than the Supreme talents who were competing for the divine power origin bead, there were many other people who were there to watch.</p><p>There was a sea of people, and it was impossible to count how many people there were.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming saw the heads of the Wu family, Jin family, Qin family, winged man family, and so on.</p><p>The patriarchs of these great aristocratic families appeared one after another.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
