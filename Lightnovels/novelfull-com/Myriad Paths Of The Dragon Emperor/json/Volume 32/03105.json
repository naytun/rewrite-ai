It was a barren land.</p><p>The environment here was very complicated. There were often stars exploding, which affected the environment here. The environment here was very hot. On the Scarlet Flame star, it was full of flames, and many fire creatures and fire-attribute treasures were born.</p><p>The people from chutian star field loved to come here to take risks and temper themselves.</p><p>The Han family had only managed to survive because they had sent their core members to the Scarlet Flame planet to take risks and train.</p><p>However, the teleportation array could not directly teleport to the Scarlet Flame star. It could only teleport to a planet far away from the Scarlet Flame star, and it would take a long time to fly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Shan crossed the starry sky and flew towards the Scarlet Flame star.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m hungry. I want to eat. Do you have any more of that treasure from last time? I want to eat …”</p><p>Suddenly, QiuQiu’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>It was obvious that the few treasures that Lu Ming had given to QiuQiu previously had been refined by it.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Naturally, here!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few more treasures that he had obtained from star-moon ancient city and passed them to QiuQiu.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained more than ten treasures. These treasures had lost a lot of spirituality but the materials were still very precious. Lu Ming planned to give them all to QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu turned into a metal ball and opened its mouth wide. It stuffed the few treasures into its mouth and began to chew. Wu Shan was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I feel like I’m about to evolve!”</p><p>The ball continued.</p><p>really? then you should cultivate properly!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Then, the ball turned into a bangle and he wore it on his wrist again.</p><p>The two of them continued to fly. Even with their cultivation, it took them half a month to get close to the red flame star.</p><p>In the void in front of him, a Crimson planet was spinning slowly. It was extremely huge.</p><p>The two of them rushed towards the red flame star and slowly descended.</p><p>“Where are the Han family’s survivors?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>There were mountains that pierced through the clouds everywhere on Scarlet Flame planet. There were many red plants growing on these mountains, and the roars of desolate beasts could be heard from them.</p><p>At a glance, it was boundless.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to find someone on such a vast and boundless planet.</p><p>However, even if it wasn’t easy to find, they still had to.</p><p>The two of them flew in the sky and began to search.</p><p>However, after searching for ten days, he still found nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming started to feel anxious.</p><p>“It’s not easy to find us, and it’s not easy to find those dare-to-die soldiers either. This is a good thing!”</p><p>Wu Shan advised.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the two of them continued their search.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another few days passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s wrist emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>This aura was emitted by QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu flew out from Lu Ming’s wrist and turned into a ball. It floated in the air and the aura it emitted grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>It was about to break through. QiuQiu was actually about to evolve and break through at this time.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly!</p><p>Of all times, it had to break through now. Lu Ming could only stop and wait for QiuQiu to complete its breakthrough before continuing.</p><p>He couldn’t just leave QiuQiu here alone.</p><p>Wu Shan also looked at QiuQiu in surprise and said, ” “Lu Ming, why don’t you wait here? I’ll look around the area!”</p><p>“I’ll have to trouble you then!”</p><p>Lu Ming said helplessly. This was the only thing he could do now.</p><p>Wu Shan nodded and turned into a ray of light and left the place. Lu Ming, on the other hand, waited there.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming did not have to wait too long this time. A few days later, QiuQiu’s body exploded with a strong suction force. The divine Qi in the world gathered towards QiuQiu frantically.</p><p>QiuQiu was about to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out a large number of high-grade divine crystals and shattered them, turning them into rich divine Qi that surged towards QiuQiu and was absorbed by it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, QiuQiu’s aura skyrocketed. It broke through a bottleneck and stepped into another realm.</p><p>Third level of Godking realm!</p><p>QiuQiu had advanced from the second level of the divine King realm to the third level.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>There was still an endless stream of divine Qi that gathered towards QiuQiu, stabilizing QiuQiu’s cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a voice transmission to Wu Shan, asking him to come back and meet up with them.</p><p>Half a day later, QiuQiu’s aura stabilized.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve broken through. Haha, the effects of your treasure are too good!”</p><p>QiuQiu grinned.</p><p>Lu Ming was also surprised. It seemed that the treasures that he brought back from star-moon ancient city were indeed extraordinary. Although the spiritual energy was severely depleted, it still allowed QiuQiu to break through another layer in such a short time.</p><p>One should know that this was the divine King realm. It wasn’t that easy to break through.</p><p>QiuQiu broke through to the third firmament Divine King realm, and its strength was undoubtedly even stronger.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming exaggerated. He then turned the ball into a bracelet and wore it on his wrist.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A moment later, a ray of light rushed over. It was Wu Shan.</p><p>“Wu Shan, do you have any clues?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I have a clue. I just saw a few men of sacrifice in black flying in one direction. I guess they might have found the traces of the Han family survivors!</p><p>Wu Shan said.</p><p>“What? Let’s go, let’s hurry and follow them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>If the other party found the Han family survivors first and killed them, then the clues would really be broken again.</p><p>Wu Shan led the way, and the two of them quickly flew in one direction.</p><p>In a flaming Valley, a young woman was fighting with a flaming Lion.</p><p>The flaming Lion was extremely huge. It was dozens of meters tall and had a powerful aura. It was an eighth-level heavenly deity.</p><p>And that young woman was only a sixth level celestial deity cultivation. But she was in a great battle with this male lion, and it was difficult to tell who was winning.</p><p>It was clear that this woman was also a peerless heaven’s favorite. In fact, this woman was the third daughter of the Han family’s master, Han Ying. She had been extremely talented since she was young and had mastered divine grade divine power. She was the number one heaven’s favorite among the younger generation of the Han family.</p><p>Not far from them, there were two old men. Both of them were divine kings. They had accompanied Han Ying to the Scarlet Flame star for training.</p><p>Clearly, they still did not know that the Han family had already been exterminated.</p><p>miss’s cultivation is getting stronger and stronger. I believe that before long, you’ll be able to break through to the seventh level celestial deity realm!</p><p>An old man stroked his beard and laughed.</p><p>that’s right. After a few years, when miss’s cultivation level is higher, you can be sent to the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor to cultivate. If you are lucky enough to join the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s universal camp, then you will really rise to the top. In the future, my han family will suppress the wind moon sect, and it is not impossible for us to truly dominate the chutian star field!</p><p>The other old man also smiled and looked at Han Ying with a doting gaze.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The inferno Lion roared, and the battle with Han Ying became more and more intense.</p><p>Han Ying shouted. The long sword in her hand shot out beams of sword light. Her attacks became sharper and sharper, and she slowly gained the upper hand.</p><p>After a few more moves, Han Ying seized the opportunity and struck the flaming lion’s vital point, killing it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
