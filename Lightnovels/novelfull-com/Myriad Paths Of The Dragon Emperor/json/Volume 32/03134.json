He could also awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind having too many divine power Pearls.</p><p>After leaving the underground space, Lu Ming flew in the direction of the core of the array.</p><p>After flying for some time, Lu Ming did not encounter a single person.</p><p>“Where did everyone go? Don’t tell me the time has already passed? it can’t be, I’ve already calculated it, there’s still more than a day left!”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts. He continued to fly forward for a while. Suddenly, he saw a few figures flying rapidly in one direction.</p><p>These few people were the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and had no grudges with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly chased after him and asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The few paragons ‘expressions changed when they saw Lu Ming. One of them said, I heard that there are many elites fighting for the divine power Pearl. Let’s go and have a look!</p><p>“Fight for the divine power Pearl? It seems that the divine power origin bead has no owner yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He immediately followed the few young men and flew forward.</p><p>Outside the formation, everyone stared unblinkingly at the large screen in the sky.</p><p>The atmosphere was extremely heavy. Many experts from the aristocratic families were exuding a cold aura.</p><p>For nearly a month, the fight for the divine power origin bead had not stopped. There were battles and killings every day. Every day, there were elites who died.</p><p>The various aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion all suffered heavy losses, and their conflicts were getting deeper and deeper.</p><p>Therefore, outside the formation, the experts of the various worlds all had furious expressions. If it wasn’t for the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s suppression, they would have really started a war.</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King was all smiles.</p><p>His goal had been achieved. The conflicts between the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s families had deepened to the point where they could not be eased. It was foreseeable that after this incident, the conflicts between the families would definitely intensify.</p><p>Internal friction in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was the nine saber Heavenly King’s goal.</p><p>In the image, a large group of paragons surrounded a Valley.</p><p>The valley glowed with light, and runes appeared one after another. It was actually a large formation that protected the valley.</p><p>In the valley, there were six to seven young men trying their best to maintain the array.</p><p>Outside the valley, a large group of young men was constantly attacking, trying to break the formation. However, the formation was unusually strong and they couldn’t break it at the moment.</p><p>“Zhao Mo, hand over the divine power origin bead!”</p><p>A person in the crowd shouted. His entire body emitted a golden radiance. This person was truly the Golden statue of one of the four heroes of the Jin clan.</p><p>He had already recovered from the injuries he had sustained while fighting for the divine power Pearl.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He slashed out a golden sword light, which hit the formation. The formation shook, but it didn’t break.</p><p>Around Jin Xiang, there were at least seven or eight geniuses at the same level as him. They attacked together. Among them, the two geniuses from the winged people’s family and the Qin family who had awakened the origin divine power factor were among them.</p><p>The combined attack of so many heaven’s favorites was extremely powerful. However, they were unable to break the array.</p><p>the Zhao family is really cunning. They must have started to set up a formation in the valley as soon as they entered!</p><p>The winged man clan’s heaven’s pride expert shouted in anger.</p><p>He had been severely injured by Lu Ming back then and had already recovered.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites ‘expressions were ugly.</p><p>The Zhao family was also a large family clan of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor and specialized in the path of formations.</p><p>The sovereign of the Zhao family must have set up an array here when he participated in the competition. Otherwise, the array would not be so powerful.</p><p>Only a formation that was set up in advance could be so powerful. They had been attacking for a day and a night, but they had not been able to break this formation.</p><p>Zhao Mo, the most powerful prodigy of the Zhao family, was also a prodigy who had awakened the divine power source. After snatching the divine power Pearl, he had led the Zhao family into the valley to hide. They had set up a large array to block the attacks of others.</p><p>The other geniuses had gathered and attacked the formation for a day and a night, but they still couldn’t break it. There was only one day left until the one-month deadline. Once the day was up, the divine power origin bead would still be in Zhao Mo’s hands. According to the rules, the divine power origin bead would belong to Zhao Mo.</p><p>“You can’t break it, just give up!”</p><p>Zhao Mo’s voice rang out from the valley.</p><p>“Nonsense, how can there be an Unbreakable Formation? I think it won’t take long to break it!”</p><p>let’s go! Jin Xiang shouted. He desired the divine power origin bead very much.</p><p>“You can break it, but you can’t do it within a day!”</p><p>Zhao Mo said.</p><p>not necessarily. Quick, attack with all your might. I don’t believe we can’t break this formation!</p><p>The Golden Elephant roared in anger, and its body glowed with golden light. Like a golden man, it kept using the void-breaking sword to slash at the formation.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites unleashed their full power as well. Their attacks landed on the formation, causing it to explode.</p><p>In the valley, Zhao Mo and the other members of the Zhao family trembled slightly, and their faces turned pale.</p><p>Controlling the formation to block the attacks of so many geniuses put them under immense pressure.</p><p>they’re dying. Keep attacking. We’ll definitely break this formation in less than a day!</p><p>The Golden Elephant roared at the sight.</p><p>The others also seemed to have taken stimulants and sped up their attacks.</p><p>“Brother woo, this elder brother, our clans have always been on good terms. Are you guys going to help others attack us like this?”</p><p>At this moment, Zhao Mo’s gaze turned to the two youths as he shouted.</p><p>One of the two young men was the Wu family’s genius, while the other was the Wu family’s genius. They were the leaders of the two families in the fight for the divine power source Pearl and had both awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>“For the sake of the divine power origin bead, I can only apologize!”</p><p>The genius replied.</p><p>“There’s only one divine power origin bead, but there are so many people. Even if you break through our formation, how confident are you in taking the divine power origin bead?”</p><p>Zhao Mo said loudly.</p><p>This caused the woo family’s geniuses to change their expressions.</p><p>Indeed, there were too many powerful cultivators present. There were many heaven’s favorites at the same level as them. Even if they could break the formation, how confident were they in getting the divine power Pearl?</p><p>Zhao Mo is trying to drive a wedge between us. If we can’t break through their formation, we won’t have any hope at all. After we break through their formation, we’ll fight for it with our own strength!</p><p>The Golden Elephant shouted coldly.</p><p>“What’s the chance if we fight with our own strength? There are so many people, and the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion haven’t appeared yet. It’s hard to say if they’re nearby, and they’ll benefit from it!”</p><p>Zhao Mo shouted.</p><p>Not only the woo family’s and Wei family’s Supreme talents ‘expressions changed, but so did the others.</p><p>That was indeed true!</p><p>They weren’t idiots, so they naturally understood.</p><p>During this time, the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had not fought for it, and it was very likely that they would fight at the last moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
