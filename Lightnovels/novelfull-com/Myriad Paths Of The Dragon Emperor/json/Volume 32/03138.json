I’m afraid we can’t take him down alone. Let’s attack him together!”</p><p>The leading figure of the winged man family said.</p><p>He and the leader of the Qin family had fought Lu Ming before and knew how powerful he was.</p><p>alright, let’s attack together. We must get rid of this Lu Ming!</p><p>Jin Xiang gritted his teeth. Then, the three experts charged at Lu Ming together.</p><p>“So many people against one, and it’s a heavenly God. Do you all still want face? come, come, come. If you want to fight, we’ll fight with you!”</p><p>The Wu family’s leader shouted and was about to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“You guys better not move!”</p><p>Saber radiance flashed, and the aura of a heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion locked onto the woo family’s leader.</p><p>It was good that someone wanted to kill Lu Ming and save them the trouble. However, they would not allow anyone else to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The woo family’s leader had an ugly expression.</p><p>“Thank you for your good intentions, but these cats and dogs can’t do anything to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Wu family’s leader and smiled.</p><p>This made Jin Xiang and the others ‘faces turn ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming treated them as stray cats and dogs.</p><p>The master of the Jin family and the others outside the formation didn’t look good.</p><p>If Jin Xiang and the others were just a bunch of nobodies, then what were they?</p><p>“This brat must die!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jin Xiang, the leading figure of the Qin clan and the winged people’s family, attacked together.</p><p>Three terrifying attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and took a few steps forward. Nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky, roaring furiously.</p><p>20 messages!</p><p>There were twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons that were ten thousand meters long.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was caught in the state of life and death, not only did he comprehend the origin secret skill,’Lord’s Gate’, but his other divine skills and secret skills had also made great progress.</p><p>For example, he had improved his Divine Dragon materialization art and could condense 20 nine-clawed divine Dragons in one go.</p><p>The twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons attacked together like a Divine Dragon Army. Their Dragon might was vast and their momentum was astonishing as they charged toward Jin Xiang and the other two.</p><p>Then, with a single thought from Lu Ming, the nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the three of them.</p><p>As for Lu Ming himself, he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged at the Golden Elephant in a flash.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming held his spear and slashed down. A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed at the Golden Elephant.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the three apocalyptic strikes had reached the limit of the eighth level. He was only a step away from the ninth level. The power was also stronger than before.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming cast two secret skills and two divine skills.</p><p>how, how can he use so many techniques at the same time? can his divine power withstand it? ”</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>This kind of storm-like attack consumed a lot of divine power. The others, even if they had mastered many secret skills and divine skills, did not dare to burst out like Lu Ming.</p><p>His divine power could not hold on.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ‘measure’ formula. He was not worried about this at all.</p><p>The leading figures of the winged people family and the Qin family were blocked by the ice chains and the divine Dragon materialization, unable to separate themselves for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main focus was the Golden Elephant.</p><p>The spear radiance slashed down and collided with the Golden Elephant’s void-breaking sword.</p><p>Just like the last time, the Golden Elephant’s body trembled violently, and it was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and cast his strongest move, star burst.</p><p>A huge spear light rushed toward Jin Xiang.</p><p>Jin Xiang’s pupils contracted as he felt a fatal threat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s move could pose a threat to him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Jin Xiang roared and burst with all his strength. His body seemed to turn completely golden, like a golden statue.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>He held the Golden combat sword in his hand and in an instant, he slashed hundreds of times. He laid out a heavy sword net around his body in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had more trump cards than these?</p><p>“Extreme Yin eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned white.</p><p>Lu Ming finally used the secret skill ‘yin-yang divine eyes’.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use the complete ‘yin-yang divine eyes’. He only used the’ extreme Yin eyes’.</p><p>The complete yin-yang divine eyes consumed too much of his energy.</p><p>However, even ‘extreme Yin eyes’ was extremely terrifying.</p><p>A vortex suddenly appeared above the Golden elephant’s head, and a terrifying cold force enveloped the Golden Elephant.</p><p>Jin Xiang’s expression changed drastically. In an instant, he felt as if his entire body had been frozen.</p><p>His muscles, bones, blood, and even his soul were all frozen. The terrifying power of extreme coldness was about to freeze him to death.</p><p>He tried his best to resist, but it was to no avail. This power of extreme cold was too terrifying. Not only was it extremely cold, but it also had a corrosive power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s ‘star explosion’ burst out with destructive power and destroyed the Golden Elephant’s sword gleam in one fell swoop.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held his spear and aimed it at the area between Jin Xiang’s eyebrows.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>On one side, the Golden Elephant roared in fear.</p><p>One was the roar of the Jin family’s master outside the formation.</p><p>However, no matter how much they shouted, they could not change the reality.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through the space between Jin Xiang’s eyebrows. The destructive power obliterated Jin Xiang’s soul.</p><p>Jin Xiang, dead!</p><p>At this point, three of the four heroes of the Jin family had died in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Outside the formation, the master of the Jin family roared in anger. His eyes were bloodshot and his killing intent was as cold as a knife.</p><p>The rest of the Jin family’s experts were not any better. All of them stared at Lu Ming on the picture with a ferocious look in their eyes. They could not wait to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>The four heroes of the Jin clan were the four most outstanding heaven’s pride experts in the younger generation of the Jin clan. The Jin clan could be said to be glorious in this generation. They had produced four heaven’s pride experts with unparalleled talent. They had thought that the Jin clan would become even more powerful in the future.</p><p>But now, three of the four heroes had died, and they were all killed by one person.</p><p>One could imagine their feelings.</p><p>The people from the other families were gloating.</p><p>The weaker the Jin family was, the happier they would be.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Seeing the death of the Golden Elephant, the leaders of the winged people family and the Qin family were shocked. They retreated frantically, keeping a distance from Lu Ming, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>The three of them had joined forces to fight Lu Ming, but one of them was killed in an instant. This almost scared them out of their wits.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were stronger than the last time he fought with them.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>All of the paragons present were in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a divine realm expert. His abilities were too monstrous.</p><p>In particular, some of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s paragons ‘eyes narrowed, especially those who had participated in the attack on Lu Ming last time. Their faces were even more solemn.</p><p>If they had gone up just now, one of them might have been the one to die.</p><p>“Do you think it’s that easy to attack and retreat?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. The kun Peng flapped its wings and he rushed towards the leader of the Qin family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
