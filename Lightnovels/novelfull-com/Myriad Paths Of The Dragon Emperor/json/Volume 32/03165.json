This allowed LAN Feng and the others to attack the stone chains with peace of mind.</p><p>“Could it be that LAN Feng’s target is this statue?”</p><p>but this statue looks ordinary. I can’t see any special aura from it. I wonder what it’s used for? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>From a distance, the statue looked like an ordinary statue carved from a mountain rock. Other than looking very ancient and filled with the aura of time, there was nothing special about it.</p><p>LAN Feng mobilized so many people just for this stone statue?</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out.</p><p>“War ancestor, are we going to attack?”</p><p>Yuan Fei secretly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“No need, I’ll make my move later!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>Let’s observe the situation first before making a move.</p><p>Since LAN Feng’s target was this statue, it must be useful. Lu Ming naturally wanted to snatch it. However, the stone chains were extremely hard and could not be destroyed so easily. It would not be too late for them to make a move after LAN Feng and the rest had destroyed it.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be a pity not to make use of free labor?</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest waited quietly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Finally, the second stone Chain was broken.</p><p>After spending so much time, he had finally broken the second chain. There were still two more to go.</p><p>“Quick, attack the third one!”</p><p>LAN Feng said loudly.</p><p>These experts then charged towards the third chain and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>A day later, the third chain was broken.</p><p>With only one chain left, they continued to attack the fourth chain.</p><p>hahaha, the primitive god statue is mine!</p><p>LAN Feng was ecstatic, his eyes burning.</p><p>He had learned from an ancient book that there was a primitive god statue in the demon ghost. That was why he had brought a large number of experts here. He didn’t expect it to be true. There was really a primitive god statue here.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the rumbling continued, the gap in the fourth Stone Chain became bigger and bigger.</p><p>After almost a day, the gap had taken up more than half of the stone Chain. At this rate, the fourth chain would be completely broken in less than a day.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then said a few words to Yuan Fei. Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed out.</p><p>The ghosts on this side were all frightened by the underworld ape war clan, and Lu Ming was not stopped at all.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming made his move, he was discovered by LAN Feng’s subordinate, who shouted loudly.</p><p>Instantly, many people looked at Lu Ming, including LAN Feng.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>As soon as LAN Feng saw Lu Ming, she exclaimed and widened her eyes, looking very surprised.</p><p>Although he had escaped back then, how did Lu Ming appear here alone? How did he manage to climb this mountain alone?</p><p>“LAN Feng, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at the statue.”So you’ve gathered so many people here just for this statue. This statue looks very ordinary, but I wonder what it’s used for?”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to find out the function of this god statue.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you still dare to show up here alone. Very good!”</p><p>LAN Feng did not answer Lu Ming’s question. There was a ferocious glint in his eyes as he shouted, ” “This person tried to sneak attack me in the fog and wanted to kill me. Fortunately, I reacted quickly and avoided the attack. This person deserves to die ten thousand times!”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted and directly framed Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, there were many people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion here. They still needed an excuse to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? This person dared to sneak attack young master. He’s courting death. I’ll go kill him!”</p><p>One of LAN Feng’s underlings shouted angrily. His figure was like a big Bird as he burst into the air and pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Before he even reached Lu Ming, a violent force swept towards him like a Gale.</p><p>LAN Feng’s subordinate was a seventh level Divine King expert.</p><p>The fact that such an expert attacked directly meant that he wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move, not giving him any chance to speak.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was well prepared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying Sonic Boom resounded. A huge metal cudgel was swung towards the seventh level Divine King expert. Its power was even more terrifying.</p><p>The metal cudgel directly broke the attack of the LAN family’s expert and hit him. The man screamed in pain and his body flew out like a cannonball. His body exploded in mid-air and he died on the spot.</p><p>An existence at the seventh level of the God King realm was killed in a second.</p><p>This shocked LAN Feng and the others.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Furious roars rang out as figures rushed over.</p><p>The dark ape battle clan had made their move.</p><p>“It’s the dark ape battle clan. Not good, the dark ape battle clan is still here …”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Kill, kill all these outsiders!”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The expert of the dark ape battle clan roared. One after another, huge staff shadows covered the sky and crushed toward LAN Feng and the others.</p><p>Several experts were instantly killed by the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>“Dammit, stop these dark ape battle clan members. You guys continue to attack the chains …”</p><p>LAN Feng roared.</p><p>He ordered a portion of his men to stop the dark ape battle clan while the rest continued to attack the chains.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash of their bodies, a group of cultivators charged toward the underworld ape battle clan and unleashed powerful attacks.</p><p>Although the people that LAN Feng had brought were all experts, the people from the dark ape battle clan were also experts with even more astonishing battle strength.</p><p>The dark ape battle clan had used the ghost battle art, a secret technique unique to the dark ape battle clan. Their battle prowess had skyrocketed, and their metal cudgel swept through the sky with terrifying might.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, more than ten experts on LAN Feng’s side were killed. Their bodies exploded, and their bodies and spirits were destroyed.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming took the opportunity to retreat to the other side.</p><p>“Damn it! Why aren’t these underworld ape war clan members attacking Lu Ming?”</p><p>LAN Feng roared in his heart, and his figure also retreated.</p><p>He could not figure out why the nether ape war clan did not attack Lu Ming. He would never have dreamed that Lu Ming was Jing Yu’s successor. Moreover, he did not know that Jing Yu had subdued the nether ape war clan a long time ago. Naturally, he would not have thought that the nether ape war clan was brought here by Lu Ming.</p><p>He had thought that they had been discovered by the dark ape battle clan and had thus been attacked.</p><p>“Let’s not attack the chains for now. Let’s kill these dark ape battle clan members first!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared.</p><p>The two Sir God experts who were attacking the chains immediately moved and charged towards the dark ape battle clan, unleashing a terrifying attack.</p><p>The moment a divine Lord appeared, his might suppressed all directions.</p><p>However, the divine Lord of the dark ape battle clan also made his move. A few stick shadows that were like heavenly pillars came crashing down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
