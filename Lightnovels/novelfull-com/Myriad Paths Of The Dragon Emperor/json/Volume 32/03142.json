If Lu Ming joined forces with the people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, they would be in danger.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, and the void trembled, causing the hearts of the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion to beat wildly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we won’t compete with you for the divine power origin bead, but don’t go too far!”</p><p>Duan Jiang roared.</p><p>“Too much? Why didn’t you go overboard when you tried to kill me? I have a strong point, I will take revenge!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His footsteps became faster and faster as he walked toward Duan Jiang.</p><p>let’s attack him together! I don’t believe that we can’t defeat him with so many people!</p><p>Duan Jiang roared, trying to incite the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion to attack together.</p><p>However, this time, the eyes of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon flickered.</p><p>Lu Ming was too strong. In addition, the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were there. If they were to fight, they would definitely be defeated.</p><p>“We can’t be reckless now. Let’s retreat first and find a chance to kill him later!”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion muttered a few words and then retreated.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>Duan Jiang was shocked, but he could only retreat with the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s genius.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure moved and he gave chase.</p><p>“You can leave, but he must stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the leader of the Qin family and said coldly.</p><p>The leading figure of the Qin family, who had been severely injured by Lu Ming previously, had been hiding behind the paragons of the residence of the nine blades. At this moment, he also wanted to retreat with the people of the residence of the nine blades.</p><p>“Don’t promise him, save me …”</p><p>The leader of the Qin family was shocked and quickly shouted.</p><p>this is an internal matter of your nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It has nothing to do with us, and we can’t interfere.</p><p>“That’s right, you can settle your own matters!”</p><p>The people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted.</p><p>They were more than happy that Lu Ming did not attack them.</p><p>As for the matter of the Qin family’s leader, what did it have to do with them? Wouldn’t they be looking forward to the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor killing each other?</p><p>The people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion retreated quickly.</p><p>“No, please save me!”</p><p>The leader of the Qin family shouted, wanting to follow the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted coldly and slashed at the leader of the Qin family, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had caught up with them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. The huge Spear’s gleam pressed down on the Qin family’s leader like a mountain.</p><p>The Qin family’s leader had not recovered from his injuries and could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack at all. He was blasted to the ground by one move.</p><p>“Extreme Yin eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A vortex appeared, spewing out a terrifying power of extreme cold, freezing the leader of the Qin family. Then, Lu Ming rushed over and killed the leader.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>&Nbsp; outside the formation, the Qin family head and experts shouted with blood-red eyes.</p><p>The death of a top heaven’s favorite made their hearts ache.</p><p>At this time, the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had already retreated far away. Lu Ming did not pursue him.</p><p>He had originally wanted to kill Duan Jiang, but at this moment, he had the will but not the strength.</p><p>Using the ruler’s Gate had consumed too much of his energy, exceeding his expectations.</p><p>Generally speaking, those who could comprehend the origin secret skill were geniuses among geniuses. Moreover, they had to be at least Divine King realm to be able to comprehend it.</p><p>Therefore, the amount of divine power required to activate the origin secret skill was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Originally, with Lu Ming’s seventh-level celestial deity cultivation and the extent of his divine power, he would not have been able to activate it at all. He had even fought so many rounds.</p><p>Lu Ming purely relied on the quantity formula.</p><p>He had stored a large amount of Shen power in the ” quantity ” formula in advance to be able to use it.</p><p>However, the continuous battles during this period of time, in addition to the fact that the consumption of Shen power from using the ‘master’s Gate’ was too great, he realized that the Shen power he had stored in the Liang word formula had been used up.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was actually an empty shell now.</p><p>If Yuan Yu had held on for a little longer, or if the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had fought Lu Ming without fear of death, Lu Ming would have been exposed immediately.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s previous performance was too shocking. No matter how bold the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were, they did not dare to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing the leading figure of the Qin family, Lu Ming held the divine power origin Pearl and stood in the air. He kept circulating the universe thousand Dao Scripture, waiting and recovering his divine power.</p><p>Although the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion looked at the divine power origin bead in Lu Ming’s hands with burning eyes, they did not dare to fight with Lu Ming for the divine power origin bead.</p><p>Jin Xiang, the leader of the Qin family, was a good example.</p><p>Thus, the scene fell into silence and time flew by.</p><p>Soon, a month’s time was coming.</p><p>hahaha, it seems like the divine power origin Pearl is going to be Lu Ming’s. Nine blades, your plan has failed this time!</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King laughed.</p><p>This time, although the conflicts between the major families had deepened, at least the divine power Pearl did not fall into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King snorted coldly. He looked at Lu Ming in the image with an extremely gloomy gaze.</p><p>His original plan was very good. This plan would not only deepen the conflict between the families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, but the divine power origin bead would also eventually fall into Yuan Yu’s hands and help him awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>With Yuan Yu’s talent and the secret technique to awaken the origin, he would definitely shine during the Grand meeting at the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to appear and snatch the divine power origin Pearl.</p><p>This made him extremely unhappy, and killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Nine blades, the world has arrived. Open the formation!”</p><p>The nine absolutes Heavenly King’s voice rang out.</p><p>A month’s time was up.</p><p>Nine blades Heavenly King waved his hand, and the image in the air disappeared. Then, he made a hand seal, and runes flew out and entered the formation.</p><p>The light from the formation dimmed, and the light barrier that covered the earth disappeared.</p><p>The formation was shut down!</p><p>The moment the array closed, everyone in the array sensed it.</p><p>Instantly, streaks of rainbow light rose into the air and flew over.</p><p>The first to fly over were some of the Supreme talents of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, and Yuan Yu was among them.</p><p>“Your Majesty, please punish me for not completing the mission this time!”</p><p>Yuan Yu and the other paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion bowed their heads and asked for forgiveness.</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Nine blade Heavenly King waved his hand.</p><p>There were people flying in front of him. Zhao Mo, the Wu family’s leader, and of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming flew over, everyone’s eyes fell on him and the divine power origin Pearl in his hand.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re very good!”</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King’s gaze also fell on Lu Ming, and it was extremely cold.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he was being stared at by a terrifying ferocious beast. His hair stood on end.</p><p>“Thank you for your praise, Heavenly King Nine blades!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
