However, it was not long before the light brightened again. Lu Ming then realized that he had appeared in a starry sky.</p><p>From afar, there was a planet floating in front of them.</p><p>That planet was the one where they had entered the demon ghost.</p><p>Apparently, the other entrance of the demon ghost wasn’t on that planet, but in the universe.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the star sky Camp!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and flew through the starry sky like a nine heavenly kun Peng. He flew towards the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The surroundings of the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence were heavily guarded. However, when Lu Ming revealed his identity as a disciple of the universal camp, he entered the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence easily and returned to the universal camp.</p><p>After returning to the space Camp, Lu Ming first met Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue was overjoyed to see that Lu Ming had returned. After all, Lu Ming had disappeared for more than a hundred years and she was still very worried.</p><p>Although at their level, it was normal for them to cultivate for tens of thousands of years, she still couldn’t help but worry.</p><p>After meeting Qiu Yue, Lu Ming looked for Wu Ming and Wu Yue to ask about LAN Feng.</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue told him that LAN Feng had left the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion more than 100 years ago and returned to the great void Holy capital.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and then headed to the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>LAN Shang was very excited to see Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, when LAN Feng came out of the ghost’s domain, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sealed the entrance to the ghost’s domain. This made LAN Shang very worried that something had happened to Lu Ming. Now that he saw Lu Ming, he finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s the dark ape war clan? Did he surrender to you?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>LAN Shang let out a long breath and revealed a happy expression.</p><p>As Jing Yu’s teacher, he was well aware of how powerful the underworld ape war clan was. Lu Ming had finally gained some Foundation after subduing the underworld ape war clan.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming told LAN Shang about the general situation of the demon ghost and his group.</p><p>“You’ve reached the half-step Divine King realm?”</p><p>LAN Shang’s eyes glowed as he stared at Lu Ming with a hint of surprise.</p><p>His soul power was extremely powerful and he could sense Lu Ming’s cultivation level at once.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Good, good. Come, Lu Ming, attack me with all your might. I’ll see what level your combat strength has reached!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Full strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>not bad, full strength. Don’t worry, you can’t hurt me with your strength!</p><p>LAN Shang smiled faintly.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally knew that he could not hurt LAN Shang at all. The other party was a figure who could beat a peak Divine King.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and started to trigger the fivefold increase in combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>After so many years of cultivation, Lu Ming had increased the probability of triggering the battle character formula which increased the combat power by five times from one fiftieth to one thirtieth.</p><p>After dozens of consecutive triggers, Lu Ming successfully triggered the fivefold increase in combat strength.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and waved his fists. Nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed in the sky. In the end, thirty-six nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed and pounced toward LAN Shang.</p><p>“Forming 36 veins, not bad!”</p><p>LAN Shang nodded. He still had his hands behind his back. The space between his brows glowed, and a powerful soul power rushed out like a wave toward the 36 nine-clawed divine Dragons.</p><p>The 36 nine-clawed divine Dragons crumbled instantly and turned into energy before disappearing. LAN Shang was not affected at all.</p><p>However, as he used the divine Dragon materialization technique, Lu Ming unleashed his full power and transformed into a green-armored ancient God. Then, the door of domination appeared above his head.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his large hand, grabbed the door of domination, and smashed it at LAN Shang.</p><p>LAN Shang’s expression did not change. He still had his hands behind his back. When the door of domination was about to hit his head, he extended a palm and pushed it forward, landing on the door of domination.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The door of domination trembled violently. Lu Ming’s body shook as well, and then he followed the door of domination and retreated backward.</p><p>As for LAN Shang, he was completely fine.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength?”</p><p>LAN Shang spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. All the divine power in his body was mobilized and surged wildly.</p><p>Buzz ~~</p><p>The door of domination trembled slightly and then suppressed LAN Shang.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s palm glowed and an ancient stone spear appeared. It was the domineering divine spear.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>The combination of the origin secret skill, the tyrannical God spear, and the exploding star turned into a terrifying energy that rushed toward LAN Shang.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s strongest attack so far.</p><p>The battle symbol art increased his combat power by fivefold, and the green-armored ancient God used two origin secret skills. The divine power in Lu Ming’s body was instantly sucked dry.</p><p>“This is … A second origin secret skill?”</p><p>LAN Shang’s eyes lit up, and he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>LAN Shang’s palm struck out and the heavens and earth shook. The terrifying palm force surged towards Lu Ming like an avalanche.</p><p>The door of the master was the first to be shaken out. After shaking a few times, it quickly shrank and then disappeared.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s attacks were all defeated. The powerful force hit Lu Ming’s body. His body trembled violently and he retreated backward. He only managed to stabilize himself after retreating ten thousand meters.</p><p>“I’m done!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few deep breaths and his figure quickly shrank.</p><p>He had already used his full strength, so there was no need to continue fighting.</p><p>“Is this your strongest combat power?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“At your cultivation level, it’s already shocking enough to have such combat power!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could show his joy, LAN Shang continued, ” however, with your current abilities, it is impossible for you to enter the top ten during the great void Royal sacred Academy’s opening ceremony!</p><p>“It’s impossible?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. At first, he was a little unconvinced. However, when he thought of LAN Feng, his unconvinced heart disappeared without a trace.</p><p>LAN Feng’s strength was astonishingly powerful. With his current strength, he was afraid that he would not be LAN Feng’s opponent even if he went all out.</p><p>In that case, how many people in the great void Holy dynasty were as powerful as LAN Feng, or even more powerful than LAN Feng?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>although you are strong, you have many weaknesses. First of all, the ancient God Body consumes a lot of physical strength. Also, you should have cultivated the battle character formula to fivefold combat power, but the trigger rate is too low. In a big battle, the opponent will not give you time to trigger it successfully!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, he was most suited to quadruple his combat strength now. He had a 100% success rate.</p><p>However, the chances of triggering it were too low. In a battle between heaven’s pride experts, the difference of a few millimeters could lead to a huge difference. Who would give you the time to trigger it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
