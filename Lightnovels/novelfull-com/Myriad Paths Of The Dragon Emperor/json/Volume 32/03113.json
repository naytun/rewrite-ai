He wanted to kill Lu Ming and the others before they could speak.</p><p>The expressions of the three peak Divine King experts behind them changed. They gritted their teeth and were about to launch an attack on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Whoever wants to die, try!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts said calmly.</p><p>Those three peak Divine King experts ‘figures immediately stiffened, not daring to move a single inch.</p><p>Heavenly King, these people are wanted criminals. They are extremely vicious and must be killed as soon as possible!</p><p>Sikong Nan said.</p><p>nonsense. Your Majesty, we’ve found out that the sikong clan leader is the mastermind behind the theft of the nine absolute divine crystal. He wants to kill us to keep our mouths shut!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Little brat, you’re making irresponsible remarks. You dare to slander this seat. You deserve to die!”</p><p>Sikong Nan’s expression changed drastically. A terrifying aura erupted from his body and he was about to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the nine absolute Heavenly King took a step forward and the void shook. A terrifying power rushed towards sikong Nan and instantly destroyed his aura. Sikong Nan’s body shook and he retreated.</p><p>“Heavenly King, you … What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>Sikong Nan said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Sikong Nan, do you really think I’m just passing by?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts asked coldly.</p><p>“It’s hard … Isn’t that the case?”</p><p>Sikong Nan’s expression was ugly.</p><p>“The nine absolute God crystal was stolen, this King already knew that there was a mole and had suspected you. However, I didn’t have any evidence, so I didn’t do anything and just waited for you to give yourself away!”</p><p>“This time, you really moved. Not only did you go there yourself, but you also dispatched all the powerhouses of sikong clan. Of course, I have to come here to take a look!”</p><p>The nine absolute Godking said coldly.</p><p>“You … You followed me here?”</p><p>Sikong Nan’s expression was ugly to death.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘eyes turned cold, ” “Tell me, why did you do this? Who gave you the order?”</p><p>“Heavenly King, it’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. I’m not a spy. You can’t just listen to that kid’s one-sided story!”</p><p>Sikong Nan shouted.</p><p>“You’re still quibbling even now. Do you think this King is that stupid? Speak, who told you to do this?”</p><p>The nine absolutes Heavenly King shouted and a terrifying aura soared into the sky. Facing this aura, Lu Ming felt that he was like an ant. The difference was too great.</p><p>Sikong Nan’s figure also shook violently and retreated continuously. He also found it hard to block the aura of the nine absolutes Heavenly King.</p><p>Sikong Nan’s expression changed. Suddenly, he looked behind Lu Ming and the others and roared,”What are you guys doing?”</p><p>Finished talking, sikong Nan’s figure suddenly rushed back madly. He actually used the tactic of creating a diversion, wanting to take the opportunity to escape.</p><p>“You’re so naive to play such a little trick in front of this King!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes said coldly, then he struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky trembled violently. An enormous and boundless palm formed, pressing down towards sikong Nan.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Sikong Nan roared. A battle blade appeared in his hand and he slashed out with all his strength.</p><p>A brilliant blade light shot up into the sky and slashed at the palm that was pressing down.</p><p>This slash was at least a few times stronger than the one that was aimed at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>On the other hand, when the saber Light hit the palm, it shook violently and exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>The violent palm force bombarded down. Sikong Nan gave a blood-curdling screech, his body flying out explosively, crashing onto a huge planet in the distance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The planet rumbled and half of the sphere exploded like fireworks, sending flames everywhere.</p><p>Fortunately, that planet was a dead planet with no living creatures. Otherwise, who knew how many living creatures would have died.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. A divine Lord who had surpassed the divine King realm was so ridiculously powerful that it was beyond imagination.</p><p>this is the realm that I’ve been pursuing, the realm above the God King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>He still remembered that Xie nianqing had asked him to reach God King before he went to find her.</p><p>He had to reach this realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the three peak Divine King powerhouses behind Lu Ming’s group had a drastic change in expression. They turned into three streaks of light and flew backward madly in an attempt to escape.</p><p>“You still want to escape in front of this King?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s cold voice rang out. He then extended his finger and pointed three times in the air.</p><p>Three huge fingers formed and pressed down on the three peak Divine King experts.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” no!   the three peak God King experts cried out in fear. They realized that they were completely unable to avoid this move.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; three explosions reverberated through the air as the three peak God King experts exploded, dying on the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming broke out in a cold sweat. The nine absolutes Heavenly King’s abilities were too terrifying. Those were three peak divine kings, existences on par with the Jin family’s master. Yet, they were killed in seconds as easily as crushing three ants.</p><p>At this moment, sikong Nan flew out from that half-exploded planet.</p><p>He wasn’t dead, but he was in a very sorry state. His hair was disheveled, his clothes were torn, and there was blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Divine Lord realm ones naturally did not die so easily. But that move just now still sustained heavy injuries.</p><p>Both being God monarchs, sikong Nan and Heavenly King Nine cuts had a huge difference in strength.</p><p>Heavenly King, spare me, spare me!</p><p>Sikong Nan shouted. He knew that with his cultivation, it was impossible to escape from the hands of the nine absolutes Heavenly King, so he begged for mercy.</p><p>“Speak, who ordered you? You must have a purpose for doing this. What is it?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts shouted coldly, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>Sikong Nan quivered and shivered. He had no doubt that the nine absolutes Heavenly King would kill him.</p><p>Even though his sister was the princess of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>it’s the nine blades Heavenly King. It’s the nine blades Heavenly King who told me to do this. He said that he has a way to let my cultivation break through. I’ve been trapped in the first level divine Lord for too long, so I was muddled for a moment and believed his words. Heavenly King, have mercy!</p><p>Sikong Nan shouted.</p><p>“Heavenly King Nine blades!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>He and the nine blade Heavenly King were enemies. They had fought for countless years, and neither could defeat the other.</p><p>They had become enemies when they were young. When they were young, the nine absolute Heavenly King had killed the nine sabers Heavenly King’s younger brother. Therefore, for so many years, the nine sabers Heavenly King had always wanted to take revenge and destroy the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“What’s his purpose for letting you steal the nine absolute God crystal?”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King said.</p><p>he made me the mastermind to steal the nine absolute God crystal, then let the various aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion suspect each other and fight each other to exhaust their strength, causing the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to fall into internal strife. This way, when the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s strength weakens, he can lead the Army and destroy the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion in one fell swoop.</p><p>Sikong Nan explained everything in detail.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>The other party’s goal was to make the aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion suspicious of each other and fight with each other. They would fall into internal strife and weaken the strength of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
