He was now completely above the Zombie King and the headless swordsman King in Black.</p><p>After killing the Zombie King with one move, Lu Ming sent the black-robed swordsman King flying with his spear. Then, Lu Ming’s body moved and he rushed toward the black-robed swordsman King. The door of domination pressed down on him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This black-clothed swordsman King followed in the Zombie King’s footsteps and was blasted into pieces.</p><p>However, the black-robed swordsman King’s life force was even more tenacious. His torn body wanted to reform, but Lu Ming would not give him the chance. The door of domination pressed down again, killing the black-robed swordsman King completely.</p><p>With the death of the two ghost kings, all the other ghostly beings had fled.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming panted heavily and quickly removed the fivefold increase in combat strength. Then, his body shrank and returned to normal. At the same time, he kept the door of domination.</p><p>Lu Ming’s few killing moves had high requirements on himself.</p><p>The green-armored ancient God needed a lot of physical strength to use it for a long time, and the battle character increased his fighting power by five times, so it was a heavy burden on his divine body.</p><p>The God’s Gate also consumed a shocking amount of divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a wave of weakness after he kept all of them.</p><p>It was a good thing that the other ghostly beings had escaped after the death of the ghost king.</p><p>In front of him, a Black Vortex appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him. He sat cross-legged and began to regulate his breathing.</p><p>After a period of time, Lu Ming was back to his peak. He then walked toward the military camp in front.</p><p>In the military camp, Lu Ming also found two Yin building blocks.</p><p>there are two ghost kings here. The Zombie King should have Yin Jimu as well, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not step into the pitch-black Whirlpool to enter the thirteenth level. Instead, he started searching everywhere.</p><p>It was strange. After the two ghost kings were killed by Lu Ming, the ghosts on this level fled as soon as they saw Lu Ming. They did not dare to fight him at all.</p><p>Lu Ming’s journey was smooth. Not long after, he found another military camp. Naturally, it was the camp of the Zombie King.</p><p>Lu Ming also found two Yin building blocks in the Zombie King’s military camp.</p><p>hahaha, so many Yin building blocks. I can refine a lot of energy!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>I wonder how the ghosts on The Thirteenth Floor are doing. Let’s continue!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the door that led to the 13th floor. He then stepped through the door and arrived at the 13th floor.</p><p>Outside …</p><p>he’s in. The war ancestor has entered The Thirteenth Floor …</p><p>the war ancestor actually passed through the twelfth level and entered the thirteenth level. He’s only an eighth level heavenly deity. This is too shocking!</p><p>The experts of the dark ape battle clan were all shocked.</p><p>An eighth-level heavenly deity had fought his way to the thirteenth level. This had never happened before in the history of the nether ape battle clan.</p><p>It must be known that the greatest difficulty of each level was the ghost kings, but the greatest difficulty of the eleventh and twelfth levels was actually the Army of ordinary ghosts.</p><p>They knew very well how difficult it was to cooperate with each other.</p><p>The thirteenth level …</p><p>There were more types of ghosts on this level. Lu Ming had been here for an hour and he had discovered seven to eight types of ghosts. They were more powerful.</p><p>The lowest cultivation level of the ghosts that Lu Ming encountered was half-step Divine King. Moreover, first-tier Divine King existences often appeared.</p><p>They fought while searching for the ghost king.</p><p>This was a good way to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s various divine skills and secret techniques were constantly improving.</p><p>Even his comprehension of the other divine-grade divine powers was slowly rising.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming fought for three years on the 13th level before he finally found the ghost king.</p><p>The ghost king on The Thirteenth Floor had reached the second level of the divine King realm.</p><p>However, this ghost king had not awakened the factor of divine power and only controlled divine-grade divine power, so its strength was limited. The main difficulty was the Ghost Army under the ghost king.</p><p>The number of First Firmament godkings in this Army of ghostly creatures had increased exponentially. There were more than a hundred of them.</p><p>The overall difficulty was a bit harder than the 12th level.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming activated the ” battle ” formula and increased his combat power by fivefold. He cast the dominating stone door and after an intense battle, he finally killed the ghost king on this level.</p><p>On this floor, Lu Ming did not find any Yin building blocks but he found a piece of black crystal. This crystal was also a Yin treasure but it was more useful than the yin building blocks.</p><p>After letting the ” measure ” word formula swallow the crystal, Lu Ming made his way to the fourteenth level.</p><p>Lu Ming finally failed on this level.</p><p>The ordinary ghosts on this level were all astonishingly powerful. Lu Ming found the ghost king on this level with great difficulty and discovered that the ghost king’s strength was at the second tier of the divine King realm. However, he had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>In the divine King realm, the gap between each stage was extremely large, especially for those who had awakened the divine power factor or those who had awakened it multiple times. The gap between each stage would be even greater.</p><p>On this level, the ghost king and his Army of Ghosts had joined forces and defeated Lu Ming. Lu Ming coughed up blood and retreated, suffering heavy injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated and successfully arrived at a stone pillar. All the ghosts retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and his injuries healed after a few days.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not withdraw from the eighteen levels of hell.</p><p>Anyway, there was still a long time before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. Lu Ming planned to cultivate here for a while.</p><p>When he had recovered to his peak state, Lu Ming charged at the ghost king again. Naturally, it was another intense battle. In the end, Lu Ming retreated with injuries.</p><p>After Lu Ming recovered, he charged over again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been on the 14th level for ten years.</p><p>After ten years of intense fighting, each time was a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming had improved greatly in all aspects.</p><p>First, his divine skills, such as the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and the nine layer Crimson Gold armor, all broke through to the ninth layer.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had already cultivated the three apocalyptic strikes and the ninefold golden armor to the highest level. He had already started to cultivate the godly skill, Wargod’s strike, that he had obtained from Chu baxing.</p><p>In addition, his comprehension of the other divine powers had also greatly improved.</p><p>Many of the divine-grade divine powers had reached fifty or sixty percent of their awakening.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming placed the Overlord Spear’s strength as his main cultivation spot. Therefore, the Overlord Spear’s strength had improved the most. Over the years, Lu Ming had been constantly comprehending it. Now, it had already reached 99% and was only one step away from complete awakening. Of course, this step was extremely difficult.</p><p>In ten years ‘time, the’ measure ‘formula had finally refined a powerful energy under the effects of the ultimate Yin treasure. It was now being passed to Lu Ming to help him break through to the ninth-level celestial deity realm.</p><p>On a stone pillar, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, the aura on his body surging. Now, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the eighth level celestial deity and he was in the process of breaking through to the ninth level.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Inside his body, divine power circulated and rumbled loudly.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s body erupted with a powerful aura.</p><p>Ninth level celestial deity, breakthrough!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
