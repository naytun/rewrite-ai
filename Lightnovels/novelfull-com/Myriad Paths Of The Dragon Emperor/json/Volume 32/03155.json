Then, their bodies were filled with divine light. Symbols flew out from their hands and towards the stone tablets.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, the stone tablets began to shake, and brilliant light began to emanate from them.</p><p>Not long after, a pitch-black Vortex suddenly appeared in the sky above the 108 stone tablets.</p><p>In the beginning, the area of the vortex was small, but it was rapidly growing.</p><p>Soon, the whirlpool turned into a Whirlpool with a radius of 100000 miles, floating in the air.</p><p>The vortex spun slowly, and through it, one could see the world behind it. At the same time, a thick black mist was being emitted from the vortex.</p><p>The entrance to ghost’s domain had opened.</p><p>Everyone immediately tensed up and prepared for battle.</p><p>A long time ago, a powerful force was sealed in the ghost domain. This force was called the dark ape battle clan, and it had amazing strength.</p><p>They were afraid that once they opened the entrance to the ghost domain, the dark ape battle clan would come out.</p><p>However, they waited for a few days and there was no movement at all.</p><p>“The dark ape battle clan has been sealed in the ghost domain for countless years. Perhaps they have already gone extinct!”</p><p>LAN Feng chuckled.</p><p>“Young master LAN, you’d better not let your guard down!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts warned.</p><p>“Young master, this subordinate will go in and investigate first!”</p><p>Beside LAN Feng, a grey-robed old man stepped out and cupped his fists.</p><p>This old man had a profound aura. His eyes were as bright as the stars, and his body emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Divine Lord!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘eyes moved.</p><p>This old man was absolutely divine Lord realm cultivation.</p><p>“Alright, thank you for your trouble, elder!”</p><p>LAN Feng nodded.</p><p>The grey-robed old man’s figure flashed and he rushed into the vortex, disappearing.</p><p>Not long after, the figure in the whirlpool flickered and the gray-robed elder returned.</p><p>“Elder, how is it? Is there any danger inside? Have you discovered the dark ape battle clan?”</p><p>LAN Feng quickly asked.</p><p>“I’ve scouted the area around the entrance, but I didn’t find any danger. I also didn’t find any traces of the dark ape battle clan!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder said.</p><p>“That’s good. Let’s go in!”</p><p>LAN Feng said, leading the LAN family’s experts into the vortex and disappearing.</p><p>all of you, guard this place. If there’s anything abnormal, inform me immediately!</p><p>After LAN Feng and the others entered the ghost domain, Heavenly King Nine cuts ordered his subordinates.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone bowed and the nine extremes Heavenly King’s body flashed and he left.</p><p>In a flash, half a month had passed.</p><p>On this day, the vortex at the entrance of the demon ghost started to shake.</p><p>“Something is coming out, be careful!”</p><p>An expert from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion shouted.</p><p>Everyone immediately perked up and stared at the entrance of the demon ghost.</p><p>After a while, some figures appeared.</p><p>“It’s young master Lanfeng and the others!”</p><p>Someone called out.</p><p>That’s right, these figures that appeared were LAN Feng and the others.</p><p>Not long after, LAN Feng and the LAN family all appeared.</p><p>However, the number of people had been reduced by half compared to when they had first entered. Moreover, the remaining people were all in a sorry state. Some of them even had very weak Qi.</p><p>It was obvious that they had a great battle in the demon ghost.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>LAN Feng kept growling, and his face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Young master LAN, what’s going on?”</p><p>The expert from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion asked.</p><p>we are under attack inside. I want to see the nine absolutes Heavenly King …</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>Not long after, LAN Feng met Heavenly King Nine cuts.</p><p>“What? You want to borrow a group of strong Warriors to enter the ghost’s domain?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts frowned.</p><p>that’s right. I didn’t get what I wanted in the ghost’s domain this time, so I have to go in again!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>“Young master LAN, since ghost’s domain is so dangerous, I think we should forget about it!”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King said.</p><p>no, we must succeed. We didn’t understand the terrain of the ghost domain and weren’t prepared. That’s why we suffered a great loss. We didn’t encounter the legendary dark ape battle clan. This time, as long as you lend me a group of experts and make sufficient preparations, we can be sure that we won’t lose!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts muttered.</p><p>“Heavenly King, as long as you help me this time, I, LAN Feng, and my father will definitely thank you for your great kindness. We’ll remember this favor!”</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes thought about it and finally agreed.</p><p>Heavenly King, I would like to borrow some young geniuses from you!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>“A young genius? The younger generation’s cultivation isn’t high, what’s the point of going in?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts was confused.</p><p>“There’s an array inside that only young people can enter!”</p><p>LAN Feng explained.</p><p>“Alright, sure!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts agreed readily.</p><p>the Heavenly King can choose the rest, but there’s one person who must come with me. He’s a young man named Lu Ming!</p><p>LAN Feng added.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts frowned.</p><p>this person is very talented and has been of great help to me. Don’t worry, Heavenly King. I promise that I won’t let anything happen to these heaven’s favorites!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>In the end, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion nodded and began to dispatch experts.</p><p>LAN Feng and his subordinates also began to prepare and refine some special weapons and array disks.</p><p>Not long after, an expert from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion headed towards Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>However, he could not find Lu Ming at his residence.</p><p>I heard that Lu Ming often goes to the blue merchant’s place to cultivate. Perhaps he is at the blue merchant’s!</p><p>The person muttered and then walked towards LAN Shang’s courtyard.</p><p>As expected, he found Lu Ming at the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the universal camp has assigned you a mission. They want you to follow the LAN family head’s men into ghost’s domain and assist the LAN family in a mission!”</p><p>The expert from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion said.</p><p>“What? You want me to go with the LAN family?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>that’s right. This is the dispatch token. We’ll set off in a month!</p><p>After the powerhouse from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion finished speaking, he waved his hand and a token flew towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming reached out and caught it.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s powerhouse saw that Lu Ming took the token and immediately turned to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows were tightly knitted.</p><p>this matter is definitely not that simple!</p><p>LAN Shang also walked over and said.</p><p>“It seems that LAN Feng wants to take this opportunity to deal with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>what a brilliant move. He’s using the universal camp’s assignment to get you to go, but if you don’t go, you’re going against the universal camp’s rules. He’ll probably put pressure on you to leave the universal camp!</p><p>“If you go, I’m afraid he’ll take the opportunity to deal with you!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“I won’t go, let’s see what he can do!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I have a suggestion. Maybe you can go!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“I can go, why?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>If he went, wouldn’t he give LAN Feng a chance to attack him? LAN Shang shouldn’t push him into the fire pit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
