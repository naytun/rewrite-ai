His voice could be heard from afar, ” “What about Lu Ming? is he still a coward? Tell him to come out and face his death!”</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you? Lu Ming is cultivating in the universal camp!”</p><p>Someone answered.</p><p>Hmph, you’re all cowards. Fine, if he doesn’t come out, I’ll challenge you. Who wants to fight? ”</p><p>Chu BA Xing roared in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Many people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion had ugly expressions. For a moment, no one stepped forward.</p><p>As a descendant of the war god clan, Chu Batian’s combat strength was extremely powerful. Some time ago, there was a heaven’s favorite of the same level in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He was also a half-step Divine King and had awakened the origin divine force factor. He had fought with Chu Batian before, but he was no match for Chu Batian.</p><p>No one below the God King realm could match him.</p><p>However, Chu Batian was a half-step Divine King. It would be embarrassing if they used Divine King geniuses to deal with him.</p><p>.com</p><p>“No one dares to fight? Hmph, the people of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion are really a bunch of trash!”</p><p>Chu Batian berated, becoming even more arrogant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you’re here, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out across the entire area.</p><p>The person who shouted was the young man in the Golden robe from the Jin clan. His eyes were shining with pride. He wanted to expose Lu Ming and let him fight Chu Batian.</p><p>If Lu Ming was defeated, he would be killed by Chu Batian. If Lu Ming won, he would offend the people of the war god clan. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming is here?”</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>Instantly, there was a commotion in the crowd.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>Finally, someone who had seen Lu Ming pointed in his direction. Almost everyone’s eyes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Chu Batian’s eyes were incomparably bright. His body exuded an intense killing intent that was locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also turned to Chu Batian. However, Lu Ming’s gaze was very calm, and even carried a hint of disdain.</p><p>With his current strength, Chu Batian was nothing in his eyes.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming? You dare to kill my war god clan’s people, get down here and accept your death!”</p><p>Chu Batian shouted, his voice rumbling.</p><p>“You’re not my opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>His words stunned many people.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were too arrogant.</p><p>The other party was the unparalleled prodigy of the war god clan, an invincible figure below the God King realm. However, Lu Ming did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>how arrogant! If you have the strength, come down and fight me, not just with your mouth!</p><p>Chu Batian said coldly.</p><p>He had heard that Chu baxing had died in Lu Ming’s hands in star-moon ancient city.</p><p>However, he did not believe that Chu baxing was killed by Lu Ming in broad daylight.</p><p>He was very clear about Chu baxing’s abilities. They were about the same level. Lu Ming could cross several levels of cultivation and kill Chu baxing?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>He felt that Chu baxing must have been under some kind of restriction in star-moon ancient city, which was why he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for a beating, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring, facing Chu Batian.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the two of them.</p><p>“Who do you guys think is stronger, Lu Ming or Chu Batian?”</p><p>Some people started discussing.</p><p>I think it’s Chu Batian, the heaven’s favorite of the war god clan. His battle strength is unparalleled and he’s almost invincible under the God King realm!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Don’t forget that Lu Ming killed Jin Yuan!”</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is also a monster. It seems like we’ll only know who wins after the battle!</p><p>The discussion of the crowd also fell into Chu Batian’s ears, which made his eyes narrow.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed Jin Yuan?</p><p>Could Lu Ming really be that powerful?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of Chu Batian’s body. He didn’t dare to be careless when he heard the crowd’s discussion. He unleashed all his strength.</p><p>A thick and ancient aura filled the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a long spear appeared in his hand. The long spear trembled and a ray of spear light pierced toward Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take out a long spear. Instead, he condensed a long spear with divine power and then stabbed it at Chu Batian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two spearlights collided with a violent boom, like two meteors.</p><p>Following that, a violent force rushed towards Chu Batian. Chu baxing’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“The Overlord Spear’s power?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Shen power that Chu Batian cultivated was also the Overlord spear power from the Overlord spear technique.</p><p>“Is that all you’ve got?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Chu Batian’s heart trembled, and then he was furious.</p><p>“God of War’s strike!”</p><p>go! Chu Batian shouted as his divine power erupted. Then, an incomparably huge giant appeared in the sky.</p><p>The giant was wearing armor and holding a long spear. His fighting spirit was soaring as he stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wargod strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body moved and he charged forward, colliding with the God of War’s attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the explosion was even more intense.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body drifted backward, and the huge ‘God of War’ also retreated.</p><p>Of course, it was not that Lu Ming could not withstand this ‘God of War’. Lu Ming retreated on purpose.</p><p>During this period of time, he had also begun to comprehend the war god clan’s divine skill, Wargod strike.</p><p>It just so happened that Lu Ming was fighting with the other party. He could take the opportunity to comprehend the other party’s clomaros ‘strike. This was also beneficial to his cultivation. Therefore, Lu Ming deliberately retreated so that the other party could fully display the profoundness of the clomaros’ strike.</p><p>As expected, Chu Batian shouted again when he saw that he could not defeat Lu Ming with one move. He continued to use the clomaros ‘strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>The giant God of War held a long spear in his hand, and the sky was filled with spear shadows. The power was amazing.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and spearlights flew out like meteors.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The terrifying tremors continued to spread.</p><p>Lu Ming was trying to figure out the Ares art as he fought with the other party.</p><p>In a great battle, one’s comprehension of a Shen technique was the fastest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the Ares art was rapidly increasing.</p><p>As for Chu Batian, the more he fought, the more anxious he became.</p><p>He had already exerted his abilities to the maximum, but he still could not take down Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only a seventh-level celestial deity.</p><p>He finally knew how terrifying Lu Ming’s combat strength was. It was possible that he could kill Chu baxing with his own combat strength.</p><p>Chu Batian started to think of retreating.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, the momentum of his spear changed. A dazzling divine power soared into the sky and a huge God of War appeared in the sky.</p><p>This God of War was almost exactly the same as the one Chu Batian had condensed.</p><p>Clomaros ‘strike!</p><p>In the battle just now, Lu Ming had finally grasped the basics of the clomaros ‘strike. He was able to condense a huge clomaros and launch an attack.</p><p>“The God of War’s strike, you … How is it possible that you can use the Wargod’s strike?”</p><p>Chu Batian roared in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
