Jingyu and I are no exception. It’s especially important for you!</p><p>“More important to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The first is the problem of cultivation. You control many types of divine-grade divine power. You should be able to feel that cultivating many types of divine-grade divine power is very difficult and requires a lot of energy, right? ”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He felt the same way.</p><p>A normal person would have to spend their entire life’s effort to cultivate one type of divine power. They would have to comprehend the origin divine power factor and also comprehend origin secret techniques.</p><p>Moreover, he was now in control of eight types of divine-grade divine power and two other types of divine power.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivation was even greater.</p><p>Under LAN Shang’s guidance and his own amazing talent, he had only awakened the origin divine power factor in his ruler’s divine power and inextinguishable sword force. Moreover, he had only awakened it once. He was still far from awakening the origin divine power factor in other divine-grade divine powers.</p><p>This made Lu Ming feel somewhat helpless.</p><p>If he gave up on other Shen power and focused on one or two Shen powers, then the advantage of the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture would not be able to be used.</p><p>Could it be that the great void Royal sacred Academy had something that could help him cultivate his divine power?</p><p>there’s a Holy Land for cultivation in the great void Royal sacred Academy, ” LAN Shang said. it can greatly help one comprehend divine power and the origin divine power factor. It can even increase the chances of awakening the origin secret technique!</p><p>“There’s such a place?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was no wonder that all the geniuses of the great void Holy dynasty wanted to enter the great void Royal sacred Academy. It turned out that the great void Royal sacred Academy actually had such a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>The myriad God cliff in star-moon ancient city also had a similar function. However, it only opened once in a long period of time, and one could only cultivate for three years at a time. The time was too short, and the help was very limited.</p><p>Moreover, it was only of great help to those who had not awakened the origin divine power factor. After awakening it once, the effect would be very weak.</p><p>However, the effects of the Holy Land of cultivation in the great void Royal sacred Academy would not be so weak.</p><p>Furthermore, this was only one of the cultivation grounds of the great void Royal sacred Academy. There were many other mystical grounds.</p><p>the other problem is the future development!</p><p>if things develop well in the great void Royal sacred Academy, ” LAN Shang continued, ” one can even establish a clan and own a territory!</p><p>“Establish a clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“That’s right. There are currently 27 Heavenly King manors in the great void Holy dynasty. Do you think they existed since the establishment of the great void Holy dynasty? Some of them were conferred when the dynasty was established, and some of them were conferred when they opened their own houses and clans. Then, they slowly grew stronger, and finally successfully promoted to the Heavenly king’s house!”</p><p>for example, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion are the same. They were created by the nine absolute Heavenly King and the nine blades Heavenly King respectively, and they were promoted to the Heavenly King mansion step by step!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He did not expect that the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were actually established by the nine absolute Heavenly King and the nine blades Heavenly King. He had always thought that they were enfeoffed during the establishment of the great void sacred dynasty.</p><p>For example, the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion was enfeoffed when the great void Holy dynasty was established, and it evolved from the original nine Serenities sect.</p><p>therefore, the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion are considered weak among the 27 Heavenly King mansions. After all, their foundations are too shallow!</p><p>in addition, there are also forces that establish their own houses and clans. They occupy a territory and develop their forces. Although they are not as strong as the twenty-seven Heavenly King mansions, they are also very strong. As long as they accumulate enough strength, it is possible to become the twenty-eighth or even the twenty-ninth Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>if you want to establish a clan, other than making great contributions, there is another opportunity. That is during the great void Royal sacred Academy’s conference. At that time, countless geniuses will gather and the sage Emperor will be present. As long as you are in the top ten during the conference, you will have the right to establish a clan!</p><p>in order to reverse Jingyu’s verdict, not only must we investigate the truth of what happened back then, but we must also possess immense power and sufficient resources. Only then can we reverse Jingyu’s verdict!</p><p>therefore, my request for you is to be one of the top ten in the great void Royal sacred Academy and have the right to establish your own clan. Then, you can use this as a Foundation to strengthen your power. Only when your power is strong enough to become the new Heavenly King House will you have a higher chance of reversing Jingyu’s verdict!</p><p>LAN Shang said a lot in one breath.</p><p>“Do the top ten of the great void Holy dynasty have the right to establish their own clans?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then nodded solemnly.”Don’t worry, uncle LAN. I’ll definitely make it into the top ten!”</p><p>you can’t be careless. It’s not that easy to enter the top ten. With your current strength, it’s impossible!</p><p>you must know that only the first-tier godkings of the nine absolute Heavenly King manors and the nine blades Heavenly King manors or those below will fight for the divine power origin Pearl. The two Heavenly King manors have geniuses above the first tier of the Godking realm!</p><p>moreover, among the 27 Heavenly King manors, the nine absolute Heavenly King manors and the nine blades Heavenly King manors are the weaker ones. The other Heavenly King manors are even more amazing and have more heaven’s favorites!</p><p>other than the 27 Heavenly King manors, there are many forces that have not reached the level of the Heavenly King manors. For example, the Lord’s Manor and the general’s Manor have many geniuses. When they are added together, it is also very shocking!</p><p>the most important thing is still the great void Holy dynasty itself. The great void Holy dynasty itself occupies a huge and rich territory. It is the core of the great void Holy dynasty and has many heaven’s favorites. The number of heaven’s favorites there is more than the 27 Heavenly King manors, the other noble manors and the general manors combined. Now, you understand how difficult it is to enter the top 10!</p><p>LAN Shang solemnly warned.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. From what LAN Shang had said, it was really very difficult to enter the top ten.</p><p>there are still about 200 years left. During this period of time, you should work hard on your cultivation. With your talent, you might stand a chance. Once you enter the top ten, you will receive more resources when you enter the great void Royal sacred Academy. You will also have the qualifications to establish your own clan. This will be extremely important for your future development!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head solemnly, his gaze firm.</p><p>He had to enter the top ten.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all I have to say to you. What questions do you have for me next? Just ask!“</p><p>LAN Shang smiled, and the atmosphere relaxed.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had questions to ask. Immediately, Lu Ming consulted the blue merchant on the cultivation and comprehension of the ‘door of domination’ in detail.</p><p>LAN Shang also explained one by one. Lu Ming’s understanding of the ‘door of domination’ increased rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
