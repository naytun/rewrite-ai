Terrifying attacks burst out one after another, but as soon as their attacks were launched, they automatically dissipated.</p><p>Then, one after another, the black-robed men flew into the bone devil’s mouth and disappeared.</p><p>“Leave a few questions!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted hurriedly, afraid that he would be devoured by the bone demon.</p><p>The bone Devil nodded and sucked in a breath. More than a dozen black-robed men flew into its mouth and were swallowed. Only two were left, but their cultivation was destroyed and they fell to the ground.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect were all dumbfounded. They felt like they were dreaming.</p><p>Each and every one of the black-robed men was a terrifying existence. They all felt invincible.</p><p>.com</p><p>Just now, one of them had severely injured the ice Soul clan’s patriarch with one slash.</p><p>They had learned from the ice Soul clan’s patriarch that the weakest of the black-robed men was at the fourth level of the godly King realm.</p><p>Such an expert, any one of them could be an existence that moved unhindered in the Qin heaven star region and could be the Overlord of the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>However, so many experts were devoured by an unremarkable burly man next to Lu Ming.</p><p>And this burly man seemed to be very obedient to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>it turns out that he has such a terrifying expert by his side. No wonder he has been so calm all this time!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan murmured, but he also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>At least, they were safe!</p><p>“Tell me, who is the person behind you? Tell me, and I’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the last two black-robed men and began to interrogate them.</p><p>“If you want to kill, then kill. Don’t expect us to say a word!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly.</p><p>“You’re quite stubborn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He took a step forward and crushed the arm of one of the black-robed men. However, the black-robed man only growled and stared at Lu Ming coldly without saying a word.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems like these people are specially trained death Warriors. They’re very tough. It’s almost impossible to force out any information. Leave them to me. I’ll search their souls!” He said.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Death warrior again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>Back in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, when he set off from the Wu family to the universal camp, he was ambushed by some death Warriors. Were these two groups of death Warriors sent by the same force?</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bone nodded, stepped forward, and began to search the soul.</p><p>However, when the bone Devil began to search their souls, the two black-robed men let out mournful screams. Their bodies trembled, and their heads exploded.</p><p>as I expected, their souls have been set up with powerful restrictions. Once their souls are searched, they will explode!</p><p>Bone shook his head.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice.</p><p>These people were definitely sent by the person who stole the nine absolute God crystal. Unfortunately, the clues were cut off.</p><p>“Chief Bing, let’s pack up and go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Alright, alright!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan nodded repeatedly. At this moment, Lu Ming’s position in his heart was already high and mighty. He was an untouchable existence.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming gave the order, he could easily dominate the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not have the intention to dominate the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>After cleaning up the battlefield, they left one after another. After a while, the ice Soul Clan returned to their territory, while Lu Ming and the kongxuan sect returned to the kongxuan planet.</p><p>Not long after, the news of the dark ice race’s battle spread throughout the entire Qin heaven Starfield like a hurricane.</p><p>The entire Qin heaven Star Domain was shaken. It was as if a violent wind that was over a dozen degrees in magnitude was blowing. Countless people were dumbstruck from shock.</p><p>Everyone knew that the Qin heaven Starfield was about to change.</p><p>As expected, one of the three overlords, the boundless sacred land’s Saint Lord, personally led his men to the Kong Xuan sect. He expressed his willingness to follow the sect’s lead and obey its orders.</p><p>The boundless Saint Lord had been scared out of his wits by the dark ice Race. He couldn’t sleep or eat in peace after escaping back to the boundless Holy Land. Lu Ming was too powerful and was growing rapidly. Even if he hid in the boundless Holy Land and focused on defense, he couldn’t rest easy. He surrendered with his men.</p><p>The enmity between the boundless Holy Land and Lu Ming wasn’t that great. Lu Ming couldn’t be bothered to exterminate them, so he accepted the boundless Holy Land’s surrender.</p><p>Once the news was out, the top sects and factions of the Qin heaven thirteen clans could not sit still any longer. They all brought people to surrender, and they all surrendered to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>All of a sudden, Kong Xuan sect’s reputation soared.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming could not be bothered with these matters. He left it all to Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Wuya, and the others to manage.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Wuya, and the others were also very fast. After the boundless Holy Land and the other sects surrendered, they immediately gathered these sects and launched an attack on the territory of the indestructible sword sect and the winged demon Academy.</p><p>There was no suspense at all.</p><p>Almost all the divine King realm experts of the winged demon Academy and the immortal sword sect had fallen in the battle against the dark ice Clan. Even if there were some left, they could not withstand a single blow from the combined forces of the Kong Xuan sect, the boundless Holy Land, and the other sects.</p><p>In just a few months ‘time, the vast territory that was originally occupied by the indestructible sword sect and the winged demon Academy was occupied by the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>These territories naturally all belonged to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>They were the proud sons of heaven of the immortal sword sect and the winged demon Academy. Some surrendered, and some escaped.</p><p>For example, the divine Son of the indestructible sword sect, whose sword Dao was boundless, had escaped and disappeared.</p><p>On the other hand, Linghu ye, The Prodigy who had competed with Lu Ming in the past, had surrendered and joined the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>For a time, the Kong Xuan sect became the Overlord of the Qin heaven Galaxy.</p><p>At the same time, the ice Soul Clan also gathered their Army and launched an attack on the red flame clan. Not long after the Kong Xuan sect occupied the territory of the immortal sword sect and the unique demon Academy, the ice Soul Clan also completely conquered the red flame clan.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame clan was almost completely annihilated. The remaining members of the clan had fled to other star regions.</p><p>The Qin heaven star system became the domain of the ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The two great forces had almost divided the vast territory of the Qin heaven Star Zone. All of this was caused by one person, Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming’s name resounded throughout the Qin heaven Star Zone and became a legend.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming took some time to return to the chaotic astral River. He brought Lu shenhuang, zu long, nine lives demonic cicada and the others to the Qin heaven Galaxy to cultivate.</p><p>They originally wanted to come out and adventure, so now coming to the Qin heaven Starfield was just right.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current reputation, many of the resources of the Kong Xuan sect would be given to them. Their improvement would be very fast.</p><p>After settling Qin Tian’s matters, Lu Ming returned to the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>Now that the matter of the Qin heaven Galaxy had been resolved, Lu Ming had to put all his attention on Jingyu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
