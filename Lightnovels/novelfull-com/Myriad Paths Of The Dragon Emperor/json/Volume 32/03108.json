I’ve found him. He has already escaped from this planet …”</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>“Inform the others, and then, give chase!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men with the strongest cultivation gave the order. Then, they soared into the sky and turned into a black light. They rushed out of the universe and the starry sky in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming, Han Ying, and the rest flew at full speed, passing by planets one after another.</p><p>They had been flying for more than half a month, taking divine pills to recover their divine power as they flew.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had the ” quantity ” formula and his divine power was endless. He did not need the divine pill to recover his divine power. However, to avoid suspicion from others, he pretended to take the divine pill to recover his divine power.</p><p>“It’s been so long, we should be able to shake them off, right?”</p><p>Han Ying said.</p><p>.com</p><p>alright, let’s go to the planet in front and rest for a while!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>There was a planet in front of them, but there were no living creatures. They landed on it and took divine pills to meditate and regulate their breathing. Not long after, they had all recovered seventy to eighty percent, and their condition was much better.</p><p>“You two, Who are you? Why did you save us? can you tell us now?”</p><p>Han Ying asked as he looked at the two of them.</p><p>After this period of adjustment, Han Ying’s mood had improved a lot. She had walked out of the grief of the Han family’s destruction.</p><p>“We are from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>Han Ying and the old man from the Han family were surprised.</p><p>that’s right. One of the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was stolen. There’s a spy in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. We’re here to investigate the spy …</p><p>Then, Lu Ming briefly explained the case of the nine absolute divine crystal being stolen and the matter of the backer behind Magic City mountain.</p><p>“So that’s how it is, so that’s how it is. So my han family has been silenced!”</p><p>Han Ying laughed bitterly.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He did not know how to persuade the other party.</p><p>“You’re here because you want to know who’s the backer of Magic City mountain, right?”</p><p>Han Ying took a few deep breaths, and his eyes were filled with hatred.</p><p>“You know?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“I do know. My father told me before!”</p><p>Magic City mountain produces the magic Night spring. The magic Night spring can nourish the soul and is priceless. My han family and the wind moon sect once coveted it, but later, we were warned by someone, and the person who warned us was the backer behind Magic City mountain!</p><p>Han Ying said.</p><p>“Who is it?” Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>sikong clan of nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Han Ying gritted his teeth, his hatred growing.</p><p>“It’s the sikong clan!”</p><p>Wu Shan exclaimed.</p><p>“Sikong clan? which sikong clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He was not very familiar with some of the major aristocratic families in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>among the powerful families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, there’s only one sikong family!</p><p>Wu Shan said, his eyes still filled with bewilderment, this sikong clan is very powerful, even more powerful than Jin clan and Qin clan. However, they’ve always been neutral and rarely have conflicts with other clans. The most important thing is that the younger sister of the current head of sikong clan is the princess Consort of nine-kill Heavenly King!</p><p>“What? The nine treasures Heavenly King’s Princess?”</p><p>This time, even Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The younger sister of the master of sikong clan was the Queen of Heavenly King Nine cuts, which meant they were a family. However, the sikong clan had ordered someone to steal the nine cuts divine crystal, the treasure of Heavenly King Nine cuts. What did they want?</p><p>“Is the one behind Magic City mountain really sikong clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in a low voice. He was very puzzled.</p><p>“It’s definitely right. My father told me this himself. Not only does my han clan know about chutian star field, but the wind moon sect also knows about it. It’s because we know who’s backing them that my han clan doesn’t dare to touch Magic City mountain. Oh right, how’s the wind moon sect?”</p><p>Han Ying said.</p><p>“The wind moon sect has also been exterminated. There are no survivors!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>sure enough, sure enough, what a ruthless method, what a ruthless method. I must take revenge for this!</p><p>Han Ying clenched his fists tightly, his eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go, the other party has caught up!”</p><p>Suddenly, Wu Shan exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone raised their heads to look at the starry sky. Sure enough, they saw a few black lights flying rapidly towards them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The group did not dare to stay any longer and rushed in another direction.</p><p>A Great Escape had begun.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>One day, a few figures suddenly appeared on a meteorite. It was Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest were originally four people. Now, there were only three of them.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, Wu Shan, and Han Ying.</p><p>The three of them had wounds on their bodies. Their breathing was weak and their faces were pale. It was obvious that they had been through a fierce battle.</p><p>These three months of escape could be said to be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Once, they were caught up by a group of black-robed men, and the two sides engaged in a great battle.</p><p>In that battle, they were all injured. That elder from the Han family had also died in that battle. In the end, they only managed to escape by a close shave at the risk of QiuQiu’s injuries.</p><p>“During this period of time, no matter how we escape, the other party will always catch up to us. What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>“The other party must have some method to track us down. Lu Ming, do you remember the black-robed man who cast the blood snake technique and a red light landed on you?”</p><p>Wu Shan said.</p><p>“So it’s that red light!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>Before the black-robed man died, he shot out a ray of red light that landed on Lu Ming’s body. There was nothing unusual about Lu Ming’s body. He could not find anything unusual even after sensing carefully.</p><p>It was most likely a kind of mark. If it landed on Lu Ming, the other party would be able to find them through this mark.</p><p>No wonder he couldn’t shake off his opponent even when he kept running and changing directions.</p><p>“The only thing I can do now is to ask bone demon for help!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, a pitch-black bone Xun appeared in his hand.</p><p>This bone banner was given to Lu Ming by the bone demon when he left the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>Bone demon was still cultivating in the dark Dragon secret realm, hoping to restore you Long’s strength to his peak and see if he could step into the God King realm.</p><p>Before Lu Ming left, bone demon gave him this pitch-black bone banner and told him to activate it if he encountered any problems. Even if Lu Ming was in the nine absolute heavenly mansion, bone demon would sense it and rush over to help him.</p><p>This was much more useful than a Jade voice transmission talisman. Jade voice transmission talismans could hardly send messages over long distances.</p><p>Even high-grade voice transmission Jade talismans had a distance limit. It was very difficult to transmit from the Qin heaven Starfield to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Of course, some powerful forces naturally had special methods to quickly send messages.</p><p>Given the current situation, Lu Ming could only seek help from the bone demon. He could not solve the problem by himself.</p><p>&Nbsp; he poured his divine power into the pitch-black bone banner, which immediately began to exude a mysterious ripple.</p><p>It flickered a few times before it calmed down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
