He wanted to improve his strength while making preparations for Jingyu’s matter.</p><p>After a long journey, Lu Ming returned to the universal camp.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming had just returned to the universal camp when he saw a huge battle.</p><p>In the sky, a few young men were fighting intensely, and it was a chaotic battle.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that the few youths belonged to two different families.</p><p>how dare you accuse the Liu family of stealing the nine absolute God crystal! You are seeking death!</p><p>A young man roared.</p><p>“If it’s not your Liu family, then who is it?”</p><p>.com</p><p>The young man who was fighting him sneered.</p><p>I said it was your Zhang family who stole the nine absolute God crystal. Your Zhang family is the mastermind!</p><p>The young man from before shouted.</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two sides were locked in battle, and many people were watching.</p><p>In the end, both sides suffered heavy losses and were wary of each other. Only then did they end the battle and retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought. Then, he headed directly to the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>“You got the nine absolute God crystal?”</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile.</p><p>“I got it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then took out the nine absolute divine crystal and handed it to LAN Shang.</p><p>As for the nine absolute God crystal, LAN Shang would hand it over to the Heavenly King divine guards. After that, he would have nothing to do with it.</p><p>“I didn’t misjudge you!”</p><p>LAN Shang laughed and sized Lu Ming up carefully.”You must have cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture and controlled many kinds of divine-grade divine power, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to tremble. Then, he felt relieved.</p><p>According to Jing Yu, he had obtained the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture from an ancient ruin, and almost no one knew about it.</p><p>However, just because almost no one knew about it didn’t mean that no one knew about it.</p><p>As Jing Yu’s teacher, it was normal for LAN Shang to know.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>“There are both advantages and disadvantages to controlling so many kinds of Shen power!”</p><p>the good thing is that it will make your combat strength extremely powerful. With every breakthrough, your combat strength will skyrocket, far beyond those of the same level. But there are also many disadvantages. First, cultivation requires too much energy. The speed of your improvement is already beyond my expectations!</p><p>“The other is to comprehend the origin factor of Shen power. An average person would spend their entire life to comprehend the origin factor of one Shen power. What’s more, you have to comprehend so many Shen powers!”</p><p>LAN Shang said this in one breath. He paused and muttered to himself, ” “So you have to act according to your ability. The amount of Shen power is not the more you control the better, but it has to be within your own control. If it seriously affects your cultivation, you have to reduce the amount of Shen power you cultivate!”</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming understands!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had realized this long ago. Therefore, during this period of time, he did not cultivate the other divine-grade mystical techniques that he had obtained.</p><p>He was afraid that he would bite off more than he could chew.</p><p>“Show me all the divine power you can control. I want to see how far you can control it.”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then cast the seven types of divine-grade divine energy that he currently controlled.</p><p>I’ve already awakened the origin divine power factor in my ruler-level divine power. I’ve also awakened the inextinguishable sword force at ninety-nine percent. As for the rest, I’m still far from it …</p><p>LAN Shang muttered. Then, a jade talisman appeared in his hand. He handed it to Lu Ming and said,”Of the divine powers you control, I am the most familiar with chief sovereign divine power. The divine power I controlled in the past was also chief sovereign divine power. This contains some of my cultivation experiences. Take a look!”</p><p>as for the other Shen powers, I need time to prepare. You go back first and come to me after a period of time. I will guide you in cultivating the other Shen powers!</p><p>“Many thanks, uncle LAN!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade talisman and thanked him immediately. He was overjoyed.</p><p>LAN Shang was Jing Yu’s teacher back then. Before the star core was destroyed, he was an expert at the peak of the great void Holy dynasty. He was unfathomable.</p><p>With his cultivation experience and guidance, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed would definitely increase exponentially and he would not take many detours.</p><p>“Hmm, go back and take a look first!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell and left LAN Shang’s residence, heading back to his own residence.</p><p>However, as he approached his residence, he saw two young men engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming found it strange. In the past, although the space Camp was full of competition, the frequency of big wars was not as high. He had just returned and he had already seen a few big wars.</p><p>At the side, many people were watching. Lu Ming saw Wu Ming and Wu Yue at a glance.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re back!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue were overjoyed when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Some of the others also saw Lu Ming, especially the geniuses from the Jin and Qin families. When they saw Lu Ming, their eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was most likely going to die in the Qin heaven Star Zone. They did not expect that Lu Ming was not dead and had even returned to the universal camp. This made the other sects very uncomfortable.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the elites of the Jin and Qin families. He landed beside Wu Ming and Wu Yue and asked,”What’s going on? As soon as I came back, I saw a few fights!”</p><p>it’s all because of the nine absolute God crystal!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Nine absolute God crystal?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. Didn’t he handle the nine absolute divine crystal at the Qin heaven Star Zone? What did it have to do with these aristocratic families?</p><p>although we know the whereabouts of the nine absolute God crystal, we have also confirmed one thing. That is, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion has a spy who helped outsiders to steal the nine absolute God crystal. However, this spy was not found. Hence, all the big families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion are suspicious of each other!</p><p>“This is especially so for the great clans that have grudges against each other. They accuse each other of being spies, and the conflicts naturally intensify!”</p><p>Wu Ming explained.</p><p>that’s why the paragons of the various aristocratic families are fighting each other in the universal camp. Outside the universal camp, the aristocratic families are even attacking each other. Some of the aristocratic families are red-eyed from all the killing. Now, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is in chaos!</p><p>Wu Yue explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect that the nine absolute divine crystal would cause so many things.</p><p>In the air, the two young men fought fiercely for more than a hundred moves. In the end, the young man escaped with serious injuries, and the battle ended.</p><p>Lu Ming chatted with Wu Ming and Wu Yue for a while before flying back to his residence.</p><p>The few paragons from the Jin clan and Qin clan looked in the direction that Lu Ming had left with cold eyes. After exchanging a few words, they left the universal camp one after another, most likely to return to report the news.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the courtyard, Qiu Yue flew out, her face full of joy.</p><p>Lu Ming had returned to the Qin heaven Star Zone alone to snatch the nine absolute divine crystal. She had been very worried. Now that she saw Lu Ming return, she naturally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you … Did you make another breakthrough in your cultivation?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized Qiu Yue up and revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>It had been a while since they last met, and Qiu Yue’s cultivation base had already reached the half-step Divine King realm. Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
