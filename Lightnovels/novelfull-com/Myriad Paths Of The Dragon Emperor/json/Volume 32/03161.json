If they found out that Lu Ming was lying, they would attack and kill him.</p><p>“Then you guys just wait and see!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming began to control the ‘battle formula’.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the ‘battle’ symbol glowed and emerged from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>The ancient word ‘battle’ emerged from Lu Ming’s body. It was bright and exuded a strange aura.</p><p>“The ancient word ‘battle’!”</p><p>“War ancestor Jingyu’s ancient word of origin is actually on him. Could he really be a successor of war ancestor Jingyu?”</p><p>The three dark ape battle clan warriors exclaimed in shock. Their eyes were wide open, and they seemed to be very surprised.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, more than twenty figures flew out from the mountain below. They were all from the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>Some of them were at the divine King realm and their auras were profound.</p><p>The nether ape battle clan members also looked at the word ‘battle’ in shock.</p><p>“War ancestor Jingyu’s origin ancient character has reappeared. It seems he really is war ancestor Jingyu’s successor. There’s no mistaking it!”</p><p>Some of the divine King experts of the dark ape battle clan were discussing.</p><p>“Now you believe me!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the ‘battle formula’ and smiled.</p><p>you have the ancient word ‘battle’, so I naturally believe you. However, this matter is of great importance, and we have to report it to the higher-ups. You wait here for the news from the Lords!</p><p>A Divine King of the dark ape battle clan said.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stood in the air, waiting quietly.</p><p>One of the underworld ape Warriors took out a piece of pitch-black bone and started fiddling with it. Then, a pitch-black ray of light shot into the sky and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this should be something similar to a voice transmission jade talisman.</p><p>Not long after, the pitch-black bone in the hands of the dark ape battle clan warrior started to glow. It was obvious that he had received the news.</p><p>After reading the news, the dark ape battle clan member’s expression changed slightly. Then, his lips moved slightly as he communicated with the other dark ape battle clan members via voice transmission.</p><p>After a while, the dark ape battle clan member said, ” “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>Lu Ming, right? the adults have sent word that they want you to come with us to the clan land!</p><p>The dark ape battle clan member said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>LAN Shang had told him that when Jing Yu had subdued the dark ape battle clan, they had been extremely obedient and respectful to him.</p><p>Now that Jing Yu was dead, Lu Ming, as Jing Yu’s only successor and the leader of the dark ape war clan, should be very respectful when they saw him.</p><p>Even if the clan leader of the dark ape battle clan knew about this, he would have to personally come and welcome them.</p><p>However, not only did the important figure of the dark ape battle clan not come to welcome him, but the tone of the dark ape battle clan member before him was also not respectful at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled, but he did not show it on his face.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll have to trouble you to lead the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>The twenty or so nether ape war clan members swayed their bodies slightly and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>A Divine King of the dark ape battle clan smiled and flew forward.</p><p>Lu Ming followed.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming was about to move, a terrifying howl came from behind him. A few streams of energy tore at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a member of the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>The nether ape combat clan’s nails were very long and they were as sharp as blades as they clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>He was a half-step Divine King from the dark ape combat clan.</p><p>However, Lu Ming seemed to have expected this. He turned around and threw a punch at the other party’s claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud boom. Lu Ming did not move an inch, but the dark ape combat clan member was sent flying, coughing up blood.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, a half-step Divine King would have been crushed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>When the other members of the underworld ape war clan saw this, they were rather surprised. All of them released their auras and enveloped Lu Ming, locking onto him.</p><p>Lu Ming was surrounded by more than twenty nether ape war clan members.</p><p>an eighth-level heavenly deity. His combat strength isn’t weak. As expected of war ancestor Jingyu’s successor!</p><p>One of the dark ape battle clan members said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a sullen face.</p><p>At first, he felt that something was amiss. I raised my guard, but I didn’t expect that the other party would really attack him.</p><p>He couldn’t understand why the dark ape battle clan would attack him.</p><p>LAN Shang had told him that as long as he revealed the ‘battle’ character, the nether ape battle clan would definitely respect him as their master.</p><p>“It’s very simple. His lordship sent a message to kill you and take your ancient word of origin!”</p><p>A Divine King expert of the dark ape battle clan said coldly.</p><p>“Just you guys?”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said. He suddenly stepped forward and rushed in one direction. A long spear appeared in his hand and a spear light as large as a mountain was shot out.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>One of the underworld ape battle clan’s clansmen shouted. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight. He took a step in the air and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, an iron rod appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>This nether ape was at the first level of the Godking realm.</p><p>However, a first level Divine King was still not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the iron rod clashed together, forming rings of energy waves that spread in all directions.</p><p>After that, the dark ape battle clan member retreated.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>The eyes of the other dark ape battle clan members widened as they revealed expressions of shock.</p><p>They had never heard of an eighth level celestial deity defeating a first level Divine King existence with a single move.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The dark ape battle clan member that had been forced to retreat roared. His body suddenly enlarged, and his muscles bulged. He became a ten-meter-tall giant ape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant ape swung its metal cudgel at Lu Ming again, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming had already activated the quadruple combat power of the battle formula and cast the moon Slayer.</p><p>Their attacks collided once again. This time, the dark ape battle clan was forced to retreat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could feel that the combat strength of the nether ape combat clan had doubled.</p><p>Double the combat power!</p><p>The dark ape battle clan also had double combat strength.</p><p>This was extremely similar to the battle formula.</p><p>Lu Ming vaguely understood why Jing Yu had subdued the nether ape combat clan and why he was so shocked when he saw the ‘battle’ character.</p><p>It was very likely that the nether ape battle clan possessed some kind of secret technique that was extremely similar to the battle character formula.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The dark ape battle clan member that had been forced to retreat roared loudly and was about to charge over again.</p><p>don’t waste time. Let’s kill him together. It won’t be good if the clan leader and the others find out!</p><p>The other dark ape battle clan member roared as his aura burst forth.</p><p>Third level of Godking realm!</p><p>The other powerhouses of the underworld ape battle clan also released their powerful auras.</p><p>There were three third level godkings.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were a total of thirteen second and first level Divine King realm experts.</p><p>The others were all half-step divine kings.</p><p>From the previous exchange, Lu Ming knew that the combat strength of the nether ape combat clan was extremely powerful. It was stronger than the people outside and was not weaker than some of the heaven’s favorites.</p><p>With so many nether ape war clan members joining forces, Lu Ming was definitely no match for them by relying on his own strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
