Her curved blade flew out and killed the heaven’s favorite of the abysmal Heavenly King Palace with one strike.</p><p>The scene was silent, only the sound of the scimitar cutting through the air could be heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The scimitar flew back into Qiu Yue’s hand and disappeared.</p><p>origin secret skill! It’s origin secret skill!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>it’s the origin secret skill. It’s terrifying. I can’t believe I’m seeing a genius who has awakened the origin secret skill!</p><p>“A half-step Divine King is already so terrifying. Now, there’s another one who has awakened the origin secret skill. Who are these people?”</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Everyone was amazed.</p><p>As for LAN Ling, her eyes were wide open as she stared at Qiu Yue with a complicated expression.</p><p>Back then, she had thought that Qiu Yue was just an ordinary maidservant by Lu Ming’s side and was not worthy to be by his side. However, the talent that Qiu Yue had displayed now was simply terrifying. Not only did Qiu Yue’s cultivation level surpass hers, but she had also awakened the origin secret skill and her combat strength was far above hers.</p><p>This had dealt a heavy blow to LAN Ling’s pride.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and clenched her fists tightly.</p><p>“Hurry up and run!”</p><p>At this moment, Guan gulang’s head had been pulled out of the soil. Seeing this scene, he was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He didn’t even leave any harsh words and ran away. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to chase after him.</p><p>Guan gulang knew what to do. It was good if he didn’t find trouble with him in the future. If he continued to find trouble with him, he would definitely kill him.</p><p>“Young master, here you go!”</p><p>Qiu Yue kept the storage rings of the geniuses from the residence of the nine Serenities and was about to pass them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“You keep it, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew forward.</p><p>It was not good to stay here for long, so it was better to leave first.</p><p>Soon, the three of them had flown tens of thousands of miles away and continued to look for and kill the sword bone beasts.</p><p>Time flew by, and soon, another half a year had passed.</p><p>In this half a year, they had all gained a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue’s gains were the greatest. The sword bones they had collected were enough for them to cultivate under the sacred heaven Jade wall for ten days.</p><p>The cultivation of Indigo spirits was lower, so the harvest was naturally less.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>On this day, while they were flying in the air in search of a sword bone beast, they suddenly heard a loud roar and a few sword bone beasts rushed out from the ground.</p><p>These sword bone beasts were all at the second tier of the divine King realm. However, they did not charge toward Lu Ming and the others. Instead, they ran wildly in one direction.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The three of them flashed and charged forward.</p><p>Naturally, the sword bone beasts at the second Sky of King God Realm were no match for them. They were easily killed.</p><p>However, before they could take out the sword bones from the sword bone beasts, another loud roar came from the distance.</p><p>One after another, the sword bone beasts appeared and ran in one direction.</p><p>These sword bone beasts were all running in the same direction.</p><p>The few of them quickly took out the sword bones of the sword bone beasts and chased after them.</p><p>After chasing for a while, they discovered that there were sword bone beasts everywhere. A large number of sword bone beasts had gathered together, like an Army, and they were running in one direction.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming’s group was not the only one chasing after the swordbone beasts. Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and discovered that there were no less than a hundred people.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked. They did not make a move but followed the swordbone beasts from a distance, wanting to see what was going on.</p><p>The others didn’t make a move either, clearly having similar thoughts.</p><p>As they chased, the number of swordbone beasts increased. In the end, there were at least a few thousand of them.</p><p>The body of the sword bone beasts was huge, and the sight of thousands of them running together was terrifying.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The earth trembled continuously, stirring up a huge cloud of dust that swept across the world.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming and the rest followed behind for more than ten days.</p><p>Finally, a huge mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The mountain was filled with swordbone beasts.</p><p>Countless huge sword bone beasts gathered around the mountain and roared towards the sky. Their aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The thousands of swordbone beasts in front of Lu Ming and the rest roared as well. Then, they all burrowed into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that a large number of swordbone beasts were charging towards him from all directions of the huge mountain, then they all burrowed into the ground.</p><p>Behind the swordbone beasts, a large number of people were chasing after them.</p><p>These people were naturally the same as Lu Ming and the rest. They had come here to hunt the swordbone beasts.</p><p>There were thousands of them.</p><p>“So this is where the swordbone beasts are gathered!”</p><p>“With so many sword bone beasts gathered, it’s going to be a little troublesome!”</p><p>what’s the trouble? it’s even better to kill. There’s no need to look for it!</p><p>Voices came from different directions.</p><p>Some of the people with lower cultivation had a serious look in their eyes. They felt that it would be difficult to deal with so many sword bone beasts.</p><p>On the other hand, those who were confident in themselves were happier.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the ground around the giant mountain trembled violently, and then mountains rose up from the ground.</p><p>the swordbone beast is controlling the earth!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Many people shouted and quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest also retreated.</p><p>Mountains rushed out from the ground where they had just been standing.</p><p>Originally, the majestic mountain in front of them was surrounded by a plain.</p><p>At this moment, mountains rose from the ground like stars surrounding the moon, surrounding the giant mountain in the center.</p><p>All of a sudden, thousands, or even tens of thousands of mountains appeared around the giant mountain. Each of them was hundreds of thousands of feet tall, making the terrain here more complicated.</p><p>From time to time, roars could be heard from the mountains, and the figures of the sword bone beasts could be seen.</p><p>no wonder these sword bone beasts have gathered here. They’re gathering together to resist us!</p><p>the sword bone beast’s intelligence is actually so high? didn’t they say that the sword bone beast’s intelligence was low? ”</p><p>I don’t understand. This old master has come to this secret realm to help the bone sword clan collect sword bones several times, but I’ve never seen anything like this before!</p><p>An old man asked doubtfully.</p><p>who cares? it’ll be easier to kill them if they gather together!</p><p>A burly young man was extremely confident. He stepped out and flew into the mountain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As soon as the young man flew into the mountain, he was attacked. The mountain rocks were shattered, and a huge sword bone beast rushed out and attacked the burly young man.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The burly young man shouted coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The body of the sword bone beast exploded, and only a piece of sword bone flew out, which was caught by the young man.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>&Nbsp; the youth’s cultivation had reached the third level of the divine King realm, and even more terrifying was that his divine power gene had been awakened twice.</p><p>This was an extremely terrifying heaven’s favorite. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>“It’s really a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was not confident that he could defeat such an existence.</p><p>&Nbsp; prodigies like them were incredibly talented, and the secret skills they mastered were terrifying as well. They might even have secret skills equivalent to the ancient God Body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
