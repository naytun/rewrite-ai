Two of the attacks landed on the Tiger puppet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With two violent booms, the Tiger puppet was sent flying and crashed into a mountain peak. The mountain peak exploded, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>However, a figure rushed out of the rubble and fled into the distance.</p><p>It was the Tiger puppet. It seemed to be fine after being hit by the two first tier Divine King realm geniuses, and it was still as fast as lightning.</p><p>“What a strong defense!”</p><p>The Xu family’s Paragon’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>It was two first tier Divine King geniuses who had struck the Tiger puppet earlier. Their destructive power was extremely shocking. If an ordinary Divine King were to be hit by them, they would be severely injured even if they did not die.</p><p>However, the ferocious Tiger puppet seemed to be fine. One could imagine how amazing its defense was.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The five youths of the Xu family tried their best to give chase, but the speed of the ferocious Tiger puppet was too fast for them to catch up with.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Outside, the experts of the Xu family shouted in a low voice, feeling that it was a great pity.</p><p>The Tiger puppet had almost managed to escape.</p><p>The experts from the other families heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“The ferocious Tiger puppet is about to run to the heaven’s favorite of the Jin clan!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>One could see that the ferocious Tiger puppet was running, and not far from it, there were six young men. These six young men were all dressed in golden robes. They were the chosen ones of the Jin clan.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The Masters of the Xu family were extremely unhappy, while the Masters of the Jin family were overjoyed. Even the master of the Jin family was delighted.</p><p>The ferocious Tiger puppet was getting closer and closer to the elite warrior of the Jin clan. Finally, the elite warrior of the Jin clan also noticed the ferocious Tiger puppet.</p><p>“It’s the Tiger puppet!”</p><p>haha, we’re so lucky. Let’s go!</p><p>The elites of the Jin clan were ecstatic. They attacked one after another. Golden Palm prints were sent toward the ferocious Tiger puppet.</p><p>The Tiger puppet dodged continuously, but there were still a few palm prints that hit the Tiger puppet’s body, sending it flying.</p><p>At this time, the Xu family’s Paragon had also arrived.</p><p>“Not good, quickly attack!”</p><p>Jin clan’s heaven’s favorite was shocked and continued to fly forward.</p><p>The elites of the Jin clan and the Xu clan surrounded the ferocious Tiger puppet in an instant.</p><p>The Tiger puppet’s body trembled as it stood up. It scanned its surroundings, but it did not charge forward.</p><p>He seemed to have a mind of his own and knew that he could not escape.</p><p>we were the ones who found the Tiger puppet. You guys, get lost!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the Jin family shouted coldly and looked at the Xu family with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>you’re the ones who should get lost. We were the ones who discovered the ferocious Tiger puppet first, and we’ve been chasing after it this entire time!</p><p>One of the Xu clan’s elites shouted in response.</p><p>As an aristocratic family, the Xu family was not afraid of the Jin family.</p><p>“You guys discovered it first? Hehe, you’re really good at talking!”</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, then don’t blame us for being impolite!”</p><p>A few of the Jin clan’s heaven’s favorites spoke coldly, their killing intent rising.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Do you think we’re afraid of you?”</p><p>The Xu clan’s chosen also responded strongly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Right at this moment, the Tiger puppet let out a roar and charged in a certain direction.</p><p>It was like a fuse had been lit.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The paragons of the Jin clan and Xu clan attacked at the same time. One after another, they attacked the ferocious Tiger puppet.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>So many attacks landed on the Tiger puppet’s body, causing a shocking explosion. A huge pit appeared on the ground, and the Tiger puppet was sent flying into the pit.</p><p>However, the ferocious Tiger puppet’s defense was truly astonishing. Despite so many attacks landing on its body, it actually didn’t fall apart.</p><p>The ferocious Tiger puppet kept roaring and struggling, wanting to charge out.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was unable to move after being suppressed by so many experts.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>One attack after another landed on the ferocious Tiger puppet’s body.</p><p>At this moment, a cold light flashed in the eyes of a young man from the Jin family. A golden sword flew out from his glabella and slashed at a young man from the Xu family.</p><p>The young man from the Xu family was shocked and quickly dodged, but he was still a step too slow. A deep sword wound appeared on his body, and he was severely injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family had severely injured his opponent with one move. He roared and continued to attack his opponent.</p><p>The Golden Void-breaking sword let out a terrifying howl as it slashed toward the young man from the Xu family.</p><p>The other party was injured in a moment of carelessness. Unable to put up any resistance, he let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sliced in half, dying on the spot.</p><p>A first level Divine King genius was killed just like that.</p><p>“Jin clan, you’re despicable …”</p><p>Outside the formation, a master of the Xu family roared and burst out a wild Qi, rushing toward the Jin family.</p><p>However, the master of the Jin family also released his Qi to block the Qi of the master of the Xu family.</p><p>“What despicable? We’re fighting for the treasure, and any means can be used to fight for the treasure. Who told you, the Xu family, to be stupid?”</p><p>One of the Jin family’s experts replied coldly.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The master of the Xu family was extremely depressed. He glared at the people of the Jin family with anger and killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s face turned dark.</p><p>What he had been worried about had happened. The geniuses of the various fields would fight to the death for the divine power source bead. This would deepen the hatred and conflict between the families.</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King’s lips curled into a cold smile. This was what he wanted to see.</p><p>In the formation!</p><p>One of the Xu clan’s paragons was killed, which infuriated the other paragons.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s kill our way back!”</p><p>“Kill these Jins!”</p><p>The remaining Xu clan elites roared as they attacked the young man from the Jin clan.</p><p>For a time, the two sides began to fight fiercely.</p><p>With that, the Tiger puppet finally found an opportunity to break out of the encirclement and run into the distance.</p><p>“Damn it, chase!”</p><p>When the elite cultivators of the Jin clan saw that the ferocious Tiger puppet had run away, they immediately launched an attack, forcing the Xu clan members to retreat. Then, they chased after the ferocious Tiger puppet.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>The Xu family followed closely behind the Jin family.</p><p>One chasing and one escaping, in the blink of an eye, they had chased for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Finally, the ferocious Tiger puppet encountered the third batch of heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“It’s the Tiger puppet, haha!”</p><p>“The divine power Pearl is ours!”</p><p>In front of him, a group of youths appeared. There were five of them. When they saw the ferocious Tiger puppet, they attacked one after another, bombarding the puppet’s body and sending it flying.</p><p>However, it was still unable to break through the defenses of the Tiger puppet.</p><p>However, the people from the Jin and Xu families had caught up to the Tiger puppet and surrounded it.</p><p>“The sun family!”</p><p>The eyes of the heaven’s favorites from the Jin and Xu families flickered. The group of people who appeared behind them were from the sun family.</p><p>The three parties were in a confrontation, surrounding the Tiger puppet.</p><p>The Xu family’s sovereign glared at the Jin family’s people with hatred, but he didn’t make a move.</p><p>The situation was complicated, and it was not the time to make a move.</p><p>The three sides confronted each other, and for a moment, no one made a move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
