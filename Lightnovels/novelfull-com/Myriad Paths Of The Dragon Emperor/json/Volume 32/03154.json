Let’s go!</p><p>LAN Shang’s expression was calm. With a wave of his sleeve, he made LAN Feng’s figure retreat.</p><p>LAN Shang, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s universal camp has nothing to do with you. Aren’t you being too nosy? ”</p><p>LAN Feng said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“I don’t care about other people’s Affairs, but I have to care about his!”</p><p>LAN Shang pointed at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“He … What is his relationship with you?”</p><p>LAN Feng asked.</p><p>“Brother LAN, I heard that Lu Ming is the son-in-law of the blue merchant!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family whispered to LAN Feng.</p><p>“What? He’s your son-in-law, LAN Shang, How dare you! You actually betrothed LAN Ling to someone else, you’ve caused a great disaster!”</p><p>After LAN Feng heard this, he roared, his eyes almost spewing fire.</p><p>Wu Fan had his eyes on LAN Ling, and this was a good opportunity for the LAN family to befriend the state preceptor. But now, LAN Ling was married to someone else, and he was furious.</p><p>“Die! This brat deserves to die ten thousand times!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared madly and his aura burst forth. He was about to charge toward Lu Ming again to kill him.</p><p>However, LAN Shang’s glabella glowed, and his soul power turned into a palm that pressed down on LAN Feng.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>LAN Feng vomited a large mouthful of blood, his body retreating rapidly, his face pale.</p><p>get lost. I’ll give you three breaths of time. If you don’t, I’ll cripple you and throw you out!</p><p>LAN Shang spoke coldly. His eyes flickered with cold killing intent.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>LAN Feng only said one word and couldn’t say anything more, revealing a trace of fear.</p><p>He had heard about LAN Shang’s personality from the elders of the LAN family. He was a man of his word. He had no doubt that if he didn’t leave, the blue merchant Association would really cripple him.</p><p>A wise man knew better than to fight when the odds were against him. He had plenty of chances to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, you’re lucky today!”</p><p>LAN Feng cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and left after saying that. He then turned around and left.</p><p>The others also followed LAN Feng and slipped away.</p><p>Very soon, only LAN Shang and Lu Ming were left.</p><p>sigh, I didn’t expect you to be targeted by LAN Feng. You have to be careful in the future. For the time being, it’s best if you don’t leave the star sky Camp!</p><p>LAN Shang warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was indeed not LAN Feng’s match now. There was no need to fight with the other party.</p><p>After LAN Shang left, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue returned to their residence to continue cultivating.</p><p>it seems like there are more heaven’s favorites in the great void Holy dynasty than I thought. They are much stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered silently.</p><p>Previously, he had defeated the geniuses of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion and the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion who were at the first level of the Godking realm. His confidence in himself had grown. Furthermore, he was improving by leaps and bounds in all aspects. He felt that it would not be a problem for him to enter the top ten during the opening ceremony of the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>But now, it seemed that he was too naive.</p><p>Putting everything else aside, even the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had many geniuses at the first level of Godking realm and above. He had never seen them before.</p><p>There was no need to even mention the other Heavenly King manors and the heaven’s favorites from the core regions of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Not to mention the others, just LAN Feng alone made Lu Ming feel that he was unfathomable.</p><p>One could only imagine how many powerful heaven’s favorites there were in the core region of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>It would be difficult to enter the top ten before the opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>He felt the pressure on his body was huge.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and started to cultivate quietly.</p><p>A few days later, in a large hall in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the nine absolute Heavenly King sat in the main seat. Below him was a young man, LAN Feng.</p><p>“Young master LAN, why are you looking for this Prince?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts asked with a smile.</p><p>He naturally knew LAN Feng very well. He was the son of the LAN family head in the great void Holy capital. He was also the most talented person among the younger generation of the LAN family.</p><p>Although he was a Heavenly King, to be honest, the status between Heavenly Kings was different. The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was ranked at the bottom of the 27 Heavenly King mansions. His status was not much higher than the Marquises of the Marquis mansion. Therefore, he was naturally polite to LAN Feng.</p><p>nine absolutes Heavenly King, I want to enter the demon ghost!</p><p>LAN Feng took a sip of tea and said slowly.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King was shocked,”what?” You want to enter the ghost’s domain?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>LAN Feng nodded.</p><p>no, there is a terrifying force in the demon ghost, so the entrance to the demon ghost has been sealed. If you want to enter the demon ghost, you have to open the entrance again.</p><p>but once we open the entrance of the demon ghost and let its power out, the consequences will be extremely serious!</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts shook his head.</p><p>it’s just a ghost banner. It’s only attached to a world in the primeval universe. How powerful can it be? can’t you suppress it with your nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>it’s possible to suppress it, but the risk is also very high. Moreover, young master Lanfeng, you’re also in danger after entering the ghost’s domain. Why do you need to take this risk? ”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor tried to persuade again.</p><p>“I entered the ghost’s domain because I have something important to do. Nine absolutes Heavenly King, can you give me some face? My father also knows about this, and he hopes that the nine absolutes Heavenly King can help us!”</p><p>in addition, you don’t have to worry about my safety, Heavenly King. I’ve brought many experts from the LAN family with me this time, and they’re enough to deal with my safety!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion frowned and hesitated.</p><p>However, LAN Feng had already said this. If he didn’t agree, he would be offending LAN Feng and even the LAN family. This would only be harmful to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Although he was a King and a Big Shot, the LAN family was in the center and had a stronger influence.</p><p>Offending the LAN family’s head, he was afraid that he would not have a good ending.</p><p>alright, but young master LAN, you must be very careful when you enter the ghost’s domain. If it’s not necessary, don’t alarm that force!</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts warned.</p><p>“Heavenly King, don’t worry. I’ll leave after I finish my business. I won’t disturb the demon ghost’s power!”</p><p>LAN Feng revealed a smile.</p><p>A day later, LAN Feng brought a group of experts from the LAN family, and the nine absolute Heavenly King brought a group of experts from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They descended on a star not far from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>This star was filled with ghostly Qi and was abnormally cold.</p><p>On a huge plain, there were many huge stone tablets.</p><p>There were a total of one hundred and eight stone steles, standing in all directions of the plain. Each stone stele was engraved with runes.</p><p>The runes on the one hundred and eight stone tablets glowed and interweaved in the air, forming a huge formation that seemed to be suppressing something.</p><p>Moreover, there was a group of powerhouses guarding this place all year round.</p><p>This was the entrance to the demon ghost, which was sealed all year round.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
