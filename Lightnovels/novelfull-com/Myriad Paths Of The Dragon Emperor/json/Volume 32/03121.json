His eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually knew how to use the God of War’s strike?</p><p>For a moment, he was a little confused.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s condensed God of War strike was aimed at Chu Batian’s condensed God of War strike.</p><p>As the spear struck out, the wind moved and the space howled. It was a terrifying force.</p><p>Chu Batian finally reacted and quickly controlled the God of War to block.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two giant war gods collided, creating endless waves of air.</p><p>.com</p><p>However, as soon as the two war gods came into contact, cracks began to appear on the war god that Chu Batian had condensed. Like a spider web, the cracks covered his entire body.</p><p>Then, it exploded with a ‘bang’.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Chu Batian spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The God of War in the sky moved his arm and thrust his spear at Chu Batian. It crossed space in an instant and headed for Chu Batian.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Enveloped by the cold killing intent, Chu Batian screamed in fear.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed out from the edge of the fighting ring at an amazing speed.</p><p>Before he could even reach Lu Ming, a terrifying spear gleam as large as a mountain swept toward the God of War that Lu Ming had condensed.</p><p>The violent waves of air swept over the God of War, causing it to shake violently. Then, it exploded, turning into energy and disappearing.</p><p>In the next moment, a young Man in Black armor appeared in front of Chu Batian. His violent aura spread out like waves.</p><p>God King!</p><p>The young man was a Divine King and a prodigy. The divine power he controlled was divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the other party’s cultivation was at the first level of King God Realm!</p><p>“As expected, my understanding of the clomaros” strike is still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, not showing any fear.</p><p>Although a first tier Divine King was much more powerful than a half-step Divine King, Lu Ming was not afraid given his current strength.</p><p>The reason why the ‘God of War’ he had just formed was that his understanding of the attack of the God of War was not enough.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I, Chu Wei, will be your opponent!”</p><p>The first level Divine King realm expert said coldly. His aura was violent and he displayed the might of a Divine King.</p><p>“You’re shameless. A Divine King genius wants to fight a heavenly God!”</p><p>Wu Ming roared.</p><p>Chu Wei’s face turned slightly red.</p><p>A dignified Divine King actually challenging a seventh level celestial deity existence was indeed somewhat embarrassing.</p><p>However, he had to kill Lu Ming today. Otherwise, the war god Family would be looked down upon by others.</p><p>The war god clan was so glorious in the past. However, in these years, they have been constantly declining and no longer have the glory of the past.</p><p>However, in this generation, the war god clan had produced many talents. Peerless geniuses were emerging like bamboo shoots after a rain.</p><p>This made the war god clan’s people have a kind of ambition to regain their former glory.</p><p>At this time, how could they be suppressed by others?</p><p>Therefore, even though he knew that it was embarrassing, he had to make a move and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must die for killing the pride of the war god clan!”</p><p>Chu Wei shouted.</p><p>His meaning was clear. This was not an ordinary duel, but for revenge.</p><p>In that case, he would have a reason to make a move.</p><p>“Shameless is shameless, what excuse are you looking for!”</p><p>Wu Yue followed and shouted.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Chu Wei snorted coldly and ignored Wu Ming and Wu Yue. He stepped forward and his powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that he wanted to force Lu Ming to fight.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. Although his voice was calm, it was filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen many ordinary divine kings and had fought with them many times. However, he had never fought against a prodigy Divine King who controlled divine-grade divine power. He was looking forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice silenced the crowd. They did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to accept the challenge.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Chu Wei no longer hesitated and attacked aggressively. He waved his spear and a huge spear light pressed down on Lu Ming. It seemed that he intended to crush Lu Ming into a meat paste with one strike.</p><p>The divine King’s divine power gushed out with terrifying power. The vast energy spread in all directions.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and cast the divine Dragon materialization art. The divine power in his body went berserk and rushed out madly.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the sky, nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed one after another. In an instant, five nine-clawed divine Dragons had been condensed. They bared their fangs and brandished their claws as they rushed towards Chu Wei.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon kept crashing into Chu Wei’s spear radiance. It exploded and turned into a vast energy that spread in all directions.</p><p>“You can’t stop me. Go to hell!”</p><p>Chu Wei shouted. Divine power surged and the Spear’s gleam continued to press down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The five nine-clawed divine Dragons were defeated, but Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. He continued to punch out with both fists.</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar resounded once more, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>In the next moment, more than ten nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky.</p><p>Yes, there were 15 of them.</p><p>After more than one hundred and fifty years of cultivation and LAN Shang’s guidance, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the divine Dragon materialization technique had improved greatly.</p><p>Now, he could condense 15 Divine Dragon images in one go.</p><p>Fifteen gigantic nine-clawed divine Dragons filled the sky. Their bodies were wriggling and their Dragon might was astonishing.</p><p>The pupils of many onlookers contracted, and they exclaimed, ” there are so many nine-clawed divine Dragons. What kind of secret skill is this?!</p><p>“What an amazing secret technique!”</p><p>While everyone was still in shock, the fifteen nine-clawed divine Dragons had already pounced towards Chu Wei.</p><p>The spear radiance that Chu Wei had condensed started to shake violently. Then, it exploded with a loud boom.</p><p>After destroying Chu Wei’s spear radiance, the remaining nine-clawed Divine Dragon continued to pounce on Chu Wei.</p><p>Chu Wei’s expression changed greatly and he shouted, ” “God of War’s strike!”</p><p>The battle armor on his body emitted a brilliant light. In the sky, a huge ‘God of War’ formed. It held a long spear and looked very powerful.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The spear in the God of War’s hand trembled, and countless spear shadows burst out. The spear shadows blasted toward the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>Chu Wei had used the ultimate move of the war god clan.</p><p>Although Chu Wei had not awakened the origin divine power factor, his degree of awakening had reached more than ninety percent. With the addition of the divine power of the divine King realm, the God of War’s attack had infinite power. It was even stronger than Chu BA Xing and Chu BA Tian.</p><p>The sky above the fighting ring was boiling. Energy waves spread out in circles as if they were going to devour everything.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely, and it was difficult to determine the victor in a short time.</p><p>“Divine King, he is indeed much stronger than a half-step Divine King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Geniuses like Chu BA Xing and Chu BA Tian were definitely able to suppress ordinary first level divine kings, or even kill them. However, they were definitely not a match for geniuses like Chu Wei.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily defeat Chu Batian, but it would not be so easy to deal with Chu Wei.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
