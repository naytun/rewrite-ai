If the divine power source pearl falls into Zhao Mo’s hands, we won’t have any chance at all!</p><p>The Golden Elephant said coldly.</p><p>“Brother woo, as your brother, as long as you help me block them, I will give you the appropriate compensation when I obtain the divine power origin Pearl. I will give each of you a level Seven Supreme-grade divine artifact. How about it?”</p><p>Zhao Mo’s voice sounded again.</p><p>The eyes of the Wu family and Wei family’s paragons lit up.</p><p>&Nbsp; Supreme-quality divine artifacts were divine artifacts used by Divine King experts, while Level Seven divine artifacts were high-level Supreme-quality divine artifacts. Not only were they rare, but their value was also astonishing.</p><p>Zhao Mo had asked for a level Seven God tool for each of them. This condition was definitely tempting.</p><p>The two leaders of the Wu family and Wei family looked at each other and nodded silently. They had made up their minds.</p><p>“Alright, I promise to help Brother Zhao!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>The leaders of the Wu family and Wei family spoke one after another. In a flash, they appeared at the edge of the valley.</p><p>Since the leaders of the two families had agreed to help the Zhao family, the other heaven’s favorites from the two families had no objections and followed them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks helped Zhao Mo and the others block a portion of the attacks.</p><p>Instead of continuing to fight for the divine power origin bead, they chose to help Zhao Mo.</p><p>If they continued to fight for it, let’s not even talk about whether they could break through Zhao Mo’s formation in a day. Even if they could, it would be a chaotic battle. Just like what Zhao Mo had said, their chances of snatching it were too small.</p><p>He might as well help Zhao Mo instead. This way, he could even obtain a level Seven Supreme-grade divine weapon.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>Jin Xiang and the others were furious.</p><p>“Since they’re going to help Zhao Mo, then I’ll kill them as well!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other heaven’s pride experts attacked in anger. Some of their attacks continued to blast towards the formation, while others were directed towards the heaven’s pride experts of the Wu and Wei families.</p><p>However, once the attacks were dispersed, they were even more unable to break through the Zhao family’s formation. For a time, they were in a stalemate.</p><p>Seeing that the day was about to pass, Jin Xiang and the others became more and more anxious.</p><p>Outside the formation!</p><p>nine blades, you’ve tried so hard to sow discord between the aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, but you’ve given away a divine power origin Pearl to help the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion create a peerless genius. Do you think it’s worth it? ”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts said to Heavenly King Nine blades.</p><p>“Help your nine absolute Heavenly King mansion create a peerless genius? What a joke. Do you think that people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion can get the divine power origin bead?”</p><p>Nine blades Heavenly King asked back with a mocking smile.</p><p>“Oh? In that case, do you think the divine power origin Pearl will be taken by the elites of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion? You’re that confident in your current situation?”</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King said.</p><p>There was less than a day left until the one-month deadline. Even if the Supreme talents of the residence of Heavenly King of nine blades were to make a move now, they might not be able to get the divine power origin Pearl.</p><p>“Just watch!”</p><p>The nine blade Heavenly King smiled faintly, appearing extremely confident.</p><p>He didn’t know why, but Heavenly King Nine cuts had a bad feeling.</p><p>He understood Heavenly King Nine sabers very well. He would not fight someone he was not confident in. This time, he had mobilized so many people, so he was probably fully prepared.</p><p>Inside the formation, the attacks continued, but they were all blocked by the Zhao family’s formation, as well as the Wu family and Wei family’s elites. There was still half a day left before the one-month deadline.</p><p>“The people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion are here!”</p><p>At this moment, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes could not help but look in one direction.</p><p>In that direction, a group of young men and women walked through the air at a steady pace.</p><p>This group of young men and women were from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>None of the Supreme talents from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had participated in the fight for the divine power source Pearl. However, at the last moment, they had appeared.</p><p>Zhao Mo’s expression changed.</p><p>If the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion joined the fight, he would be in a bad situation.</p><p>the fight is intense, but it’s over now. The divine power Pearl is a treasure of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. You can’t take it!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion sneered with confidence.</p><p>They slowly advanced towards the valley.</p><p>Jin Xing, Qin Feng, let’s join forces. As long as you help me block the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, I’ll give each of you a seventh-grade divine artifact!</p><p>Zhao Mo roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; the Zhao family was skilled in formations and artifact-making, so they had the most divine artifacts of all the major families.</p><p>Jin Xiang and the others were slightly surprised.</p><p>“Which is more important, the divine power Pearl or the divine artifact? As long as you obtain the divine power Pearl, you’ll be able to awaken the origin secret technique. You’ll be valued by the sage Emperor at the great void Royal sacred Academy and rise to great heights. Which one do you choose?”</p><p>so, let’s break this formation first. Then, whoever gets the divine power Pearl will depend on their own abilities. What do you think, everyone? ”</p><p>The voice of a heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion resounded throughout the entire area, and it was extremely alluring.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together and break this formation!”</p><p>Jin Xiang was the first to speak.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The leaders of the other fields agreed to work with the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s elites to break the formation first, and then fight for the divine power Pearl with their own abilities.</p><p>&Nbsp; compared to a Supreme-quality level Seven divine artifact, the divine power origin Pearl was naturally more attractive to them.</p><p>Even though a Supreme-grade level Seven divine artifact was precious, it was still far from being comparable to a divine power origin Pearl.</p><p>They would rather take a gamble.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion chuckled and came to the valley.</p><p>The paragons of the Wu family and Wei family looked grim as they slowly retreated out of the valley.</p><p>The paragons who had joined the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were too strong for them to resist. If they tried to stop them, they would only get themselves killed.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>A young man from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted coldly. Suddenly, his divine power exploded, and terrifying blade auras soared into the sky, blasting toward the formation in the valley.</p><p>Naturally, there was no lack of godkings who had awakened the origin divine power factor in the nine blades Heavenly King residence. Their strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>At the same time, Jin Xiang and the others also made their moves.</p><p>There were hundreds of terrifying attacks blasting towards the valley.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The formation that the Zhao family had set up started to shake violently.</p><p>Although this battle had been set up by the Zhao clan’s elites in advance and had amazing defensive capabilities, it still couldn’t withstand the attacks of so many elites.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>After a few rounds of attacks, cracks appeared on the Grand array.</p><p>Many people’s eyes brightened. The formation was about to be broken. They were ready to fight for the divine power Beads at any time.</p><p>“The divine power Pearl is for you!”</p><p>Zhao Mo gritted his teeth. Although he was reluctant, he still made a decision and threw the divine power Pearl in his hand.</p><p>If he didn’t throw out the divine power origin bead, he wouldn’t be able to keep it when the formation was broken. Then, he and the Zhao family’s elites would all die.</p><p>The divine power origin Pearl turned into a streak of light and flew into the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
