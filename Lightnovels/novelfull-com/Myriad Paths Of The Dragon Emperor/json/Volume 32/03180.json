This was normal.</p><p>But even so, it was already terrifying enough.</p><p>Divine King experts were peak experts in the Qin heaven star realm. But placed here, they were nothing. There were too many of them, and they could be found in large numbers.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a sense of urgency.</p><p>With his current strength, he would definitely be an Overlord in the Qin heaven Star Zone. Lu Ming was confident that he could even kill a fourth level Godking in the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>However, he was nothing in the great illusionary divine capital. There were too many people who could kill him.</p><p>One could only imagine how powerful the great illusionary divine capital was.</p><p>It would be difficult to reverse Jingyu’s verdict. Lu Ming had a long way to go.</p><p>Following LAN Shang, they went around in circles and soon arrived in front of a courtyard.</p><p>This courtyard was relatively remote, but it was rather quiet.</p><p>“I bought this when I was in the Holy capital of the great illusionary world. As it is located in a remote area and the area is not big, it was not taken away. During this period of time, let’s stay here!”</p><p>LAN Shang said. He then opened the door and walked in.</p><p>The courtyard wasn’t big, but it was well-equipped. There were more than ten rooms, enough for them.</p><p>Everyone found their own rooms to stay in.</p><p>The next day!</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll bring you to an old friend of mine today!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, in the great illusionary divine capital, you must not let anyone know that you are Jing Yu’s successor. At least, before you have enough power, you must not let anyone know. Otherwise, you will be killed!”</p><p>LAN Shang warned.</p><p>“Yes, I understand!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>also, Wu Fan, the son of the state preceptor, has his eyes on Ling ‘er, so I can’t treat you as my son-in-law anymore. Otherwise, Wu Fan will probably cause you trouble …</p><p>LAN Shang frowned and muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait for the blue merchant to not treat him as a son-in-law.</p><p>“How about this, in front of others in the future, you will be my disciple. Anyway, I am a cripple taking in a disciple, so others should not care too much!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>The two of them walked out of the courtyard and headed north. They chatted as they walked.</p><p>this old friend of mine is from the great illusionary divine capital’s great aristocratic family, the guangu family. It is not like the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence’s Jin family. The Qin family can not be compared to them. They are much stronger!</p><p>“I went through life and death with the head of the guangu family when we were young. There is a divine pill in the guangu family called the heaven Nirvana pill. It has a heaven defying effect. A half-step Divine King who consumes it has a 50 – 60% chance of breaking through to the divine King realm. Even a Divine King has a great chance of breaking through to the next level without any side effects!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“To be able to give a half-step Divine King a fifty to sixty percent chance of breaking through to the divine King realm, this effect is truly heaven defying …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and very shocked.</p><p>Breaking through to the Godking realm was extremely, extremely difficult.</p><p>Countless experts were stuck at the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>However, the heaven Nirvana pill gave people a fifty to sixty percent chance of breaking through. This was already very heaven-defying.</p><p>Furthermore, divine kings would have a high chance of breaking through to the next level if they took it. More importantly, there were no side effects.</p><p>Lu Ming knew of a type of divine pill called the king breakthrough pill. It could also allow a Divine King to break through. Back then, the Jin and Qin clan had given the king breakthrough pill to the sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others in the Qin Tian Galaxy, allowing them to break through to the fourth level of the divine King realm.</p><p>However, the king breakthrough pill had a huge side effect. After using it, one’s potential would be exhausted in advance, and it would be difficult to break through in the future.</p><p>However, the sky Nirvana pill had no side effects, so its value was many times higher.</p><p>“However, each person can only use the Nirvana pill once. The first time will have an effect. The second time will have almost no effect. You have never used it before. With your talent, you should have a high chance of breaking through to the divine King realm after taking it!”</p><p>LAN Shang explained.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. The great illusionary divine sect was indeed the great illusionary divine capital. They even had such a godly medicine.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they walked. On the way, LAN Shang told Lu Ming many things about the great illusionary divine capital so that Lu Ming could better adapt to life in the great illusionary divine capital.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a teleportation area and stepped onto a teleportation array.</p><p>Yes, it was a teleportation array.</p><p>The great illusionary divine stage was too big. It was even bigger than a life planet. Its territory was too vast, and there were countless living beings.</p><p>If everyone were to fly in the air, it would appear more chaotic. Hence, many short-distance teleportation arrays were set up in the great illusionary Holy capital. They could teleport to and fro within the great illusionary Holy capital. This way, it would be very convenient to go to a certain place.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the northern area and came to a huge mansion.</p><p>The mansion was extremely small and it occupied a vast area.</p><p>This was the mansion of the Guan Gu family.</p><p>LAN Shang stated his intention, and someone naturally went to inform him.</p><p>hahaha, brother basket, I haven’t seen you in years. What brings you here? ”</p><p>Not long after, a middle-aged man walked out and laughed.</p><p>This man was the head of the Guan Gu family, Guan Gujian.</p><p>“Brother Guan Gu, how have you been?”</p><p>LAN Shang cupped his fists.</p><p>“Haha, I’m still the same. Let’s go in and have a drink!”</p><p>Guan Gujian said.</p><p>In a courtyard, Lu Ming, LAN Shang, Guan Gujian and a young man sat at a table.</p><p>They drank and chatted.</p><p>Through the chat, he learned that the young man was Guan Gujian’s son, Guan gulang.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Guan Gujian looked at Lu Ming with a curious expression.</p><p>“Brother Guan Gu, this is my new disciple. His name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>LAN Shang began to introduce.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets senior Guan Gu!” Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, is this your new disciple?”</p><p>Guan gulang sized Lu Ming up curiously, his eyes showing a hint of contempt. He said,”Uncle LAN, when your cultivation was crippled back then, I didn’t expect that your vision had also become worse. Your method of teaching your disciples is also no longer good. Your cultivation is only below the God King level, hehe …”</p><p>In his words, the contempt was very obvious. When he said this, Guan gulang’s tone changed again,”I say, uncle LAN, you haven’t come to find my father for so many years. Now that you’ve suddenly come, could it be that you have something to ask my father for help?”</p><p>LAN Shang’s hand that was holding the wine glass stiffened.</p><p>It would be strange if he felt good after being looked down upon by a junior.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. This Guan gulang was really asking for a beating. He had been mocking and ridiculing Lu Ming from the beginning.</p><p>“Lang ‘er, what nonsense are you spouting? How can you talk to your uncle LAN like that?”</p><p>Guan Gujian scolded.</p><p>However, his voice was not loud. Anyone could tell that Guan Gujian was not angry at all. He was just pretending to scold.</p><p>“Father, your son was wrong!”</p><p>Guan gulang pretended to admit his mistake, but the contempt on his face was even stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
