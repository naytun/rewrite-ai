In this way, the bone demon could not rush over and could use the inter-star field teleportation formation to leave.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party wanted to hold them back and wait for help.</p><p>It was very likely that the other party had an expert at the peak of the God King realm who had come to the chutian star field.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and the rest were extremely anxious, they could do nothing about it.</p><p>Sure enough, after the two sides fought for a while, the inter-star field teleportation array on the meteorite lit up. A few figures appeared in the inter-star field teleportation array.</p><p>A few figures were completely wrapped in black robes, and their faces could not be seen clearly. They were dressed exactly the same as the men of sacrifice from before.</p><p>As soon as these people appeared, they turned their gazes toward the distant starry sky, where bone demon and the black-robed old man were fighting.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the few of them turned into a few rays of black light and soared into the sky. They rushed towards Lu Ming and the rest at a terrifying speed.</p><p>.com</p><p>In a few breaths, a few black-robed men appeared near Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“You’ve come at the right time. These people are our targets. Let’s attack together and kill them!”</p><p>The black-robed elder said.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three black-robed men attacked at the same time. Three blood-red blade-lights slashed toward Lu Ming, bone, and the rest.</p><p>The power of their attacks was shocking.</p><p>One of their attacks was not weaker than the black-robed elder’s. Without a doubt, he was a peak Divine King expert.</p><p>The other two black-robed men were slightly weaker, but they were also very terrifying experts.</p><p>Bone’s expression changed when he saw so many powerhouses attacking at the same time.</p><p>we can’t leave this inter-star field teleportation formation. Retreat first!</p><p>The bone demon roared in anger. Its huge body rolled up to protect Lu Ming and the rest as it retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The terrifying blade light hit the scales on the bone demon’s body, creating clanking sounds and sending sparks in all directions. However, it didn’t break the bone demon’s defense.</p><p>divine Lord realm body, how is it possible? ”</p><p>The black-clothed old man shouted in shock.</p><p>There was only one possibility for them to be unable to break through bone demon’s physical defense, and that was that his body was beyond the level of a God King.</p><p>Above the God King realm was the God monarch realm, which meant the monarch of gods.</p><p>A divine Lord was much stronger than a Divine King.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The bone demon’s body trembled, but only a few scratches appeared on its scales. It was completely fine. It led Lu Ming and the others as they continued to charge outwards.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>The elder in black bellowed and exerted his strength to the extreme. Streaks of terrifying saber-light that seemed to be able to split the sky slashed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The other black-robed men also launched a fierce attack.</p><p>However, the bone demon curled up its body and protected Lu Ming and the rest. It ignored its own defense and barged in savagely. The attacks of the old man in Black and the others were constantly knocked away.</p><p>At this moment, another figure appeared in the inter-star field teleportation formation. It was a middle-aged man. As soon as he appeared, he rushed into the starry sky and attacked bone demon.</p><p>This burly man was actually a peak Divine King powerhouse too.</p><p>This way, the other party had sent out three peak God King experts to attack bone demon. Such a lineup was truly terrifying. In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, unless a God monarch was involved, no one would be a match for them.</p><p>The three peak Divine King experts launched a terrifying attack on bone demon. Even though bone demon had the body of a Dark Dragon and the body of a divine Lord, he couldn’t take it anymore. His body trembled continuously and the marks on his body increased.</p><p>If bone demon relied on Dark Dragon’s strong body, he would definitely not be a match for him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. The sikong family had sent so many experts to kill them. Two of them had even revealed their true faces. This meant that they were determined to kill them.</p><p>“You want to stop me with just these few bastards? in your dreams!”</p><p>The bone demon roared and released a Dragon’s Roar. The black light on its body brightened as it continued to attack.</p><p>His life-risking fighting style had finally achieved some results.</p><p>The three king God Realm Warriors were attacking the bone demon from three directions. Thus, the bone demon could only attack one person in each direction.</p><p>The other two black-robed men were not peak Divine King experts.</p><p>Under the bone demon’s attack, the experts on the other side were forced to retreat.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The bone Devil roared and continuously stepped forward with its dragon claws, bombarding the expert in front of it.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>That master and the bone Devil collided dozens of times, and under the bone Devil’s desperate fighting style, the man was forced to retreat.</p><p>The bone demon would not miss such an opportunity. It swept up Lu Ming and the rest and burst out of the encirclement. Then, it flew away at high speed.</p><p>“Damn it, chase!”</p><p>“We can’t let them get away!”</p><p>The three peak Divine King experts pursued Lu Ming’s group at maximum speed.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, flew a long distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“You want to catch up to me? dream on!”</p><p>Bone sneered and used some kind of secret technique to increase his speed, slowly increasing the distance between them.</p><p>The three experts at the back were extremely anxious. The sikong clan master had already given a death order that Lu Ming and the rest must not be allowed to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest must have already known the secret. If the fact that the sikong clan was the mastermind behind the theft of the nine absolute divine crystal was exposed, the sikong clan would face a disaster.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming and the rest had to die.</p><p>The three masters used all their strength to chase after the bone Devil, but their speed was still slower than the bone Devil’s, and the distance between them and the bone Devil slowly widened.</p><p>If this continued, they would escape sooner or later.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the void in front of Lu Ming and the rest suddenly fluctuated. The space rippled like waves.</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared in the void.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man. He was handsome, but his face was cold. His eyes were bright.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill him! the cold-looking middle-aged man said indifferently as he struck his palm at bone demon.</p><p>Instantly, a blade light shot out from the cold-looking middle-aged man’s palm.</p><p>Terrifying, extremely terrifying!</p><p>As soon as the saber Light was released, Lu Ming felt a sense of horror as if he would be destroyed in the next moment. Lu Ming had never encountered such a terrifying enemy in reality.</p><p>The blade light was shocking and cut through the universe as if it was going to split the entire starry sky in half.</p><p>Lu Ming had no doubt that if this Saber Light were to slash a life planet, it would most likely split the life planet into two.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Bone’s expression changed, and he twisted his body, wanting to fly in another direction, but it was too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The blade light hit the bone demon’s body, and blood splattered everywhere. A thousand-meter long wound appeared on the bone demon’s body, almost cutting it in half.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
