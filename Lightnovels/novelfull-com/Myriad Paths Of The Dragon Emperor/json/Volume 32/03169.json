It had reached the half-step Divine King realm and was equivalent to a half-step Divine King who had mastered the divine grade divine power.</p><p>However, he was still easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, he entered the fifth floor.</p><p>The ghost kings on the fifth floor were also half-step divine kings. However, they were equivalent to half-step divine kings who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>As for the ghost king on the sixth floor, although he was also a half-step Divine King, he was equivalent to a Divine King who had awakened the divine power factor twice. He was already very powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a total of two years to pass the first six levels.</p><p>The top seven floors of the stone tower outside were all shining.</p><p>It meant that Lu Ming had passed the sixth level and was now on the seventh level.</p><p>“To be able to pass the sixth level, not bad!”</p><p>Someone nodded in praise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the eighth level of the celestial deity realm, while the ghost king on the sixth level was a half-step Divine King. Moreover, he was a half-step Divine King who had awakened his divine power factor for the second time.</p><p>The fact that Lu Ming was able to pass the sixth level meant that he had killed the ghost king on the sixth level.</p><p>With his cultivation at the eighth level of the heavenly deity realm, he had crossed several levels and killed the ghost king, who had awakened his divine power factor twice. This strength was already very shocking.</p><p>the difference between the sixth level and the ninth level is like the difference between heaven and earth. Those who can pass the sixth level can only be considered to have good talent. Only those who can pass the ninth level can be considered to be peerless geniuses and be worthy of being followed by our dark ape battle clan!</p><p>Yuan Cong said indifferently. The other nether apes shut their mouths and continued to wait.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the seventh level of the eighteen levels of hell, he realized that the average strength of the ghosts on this level was stronger. Countless ghosts were densely packed and charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were too many of them.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they would have to spend a lot of energy just to deal with these ghosts. How could they have the energy to find the king of ghosts?</p><p>It was no wonder that some people had to spend thousands or tens of thousands of years to pass a level. It was very difficult for those who were not strong enough to deal with these ghostly beings on one hand, and it was normal for them to spend a lot of time searching for the ghost king on the other.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, these ghosts were nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with his strength and killed a large number of ghosts. He easily broke out of the siege.</p><p>Although there were many ghosts blocking Lu Ming’s way, he easily broke through them.</p><p>Lu Ming fought with these ghosts while he searched for the king of ghosts.</p><p>Finally, after half a year, Lu Ming found the gathering place of the king of ghosts.</p><p>It was a huge cave.</p><p>Lu Ming charged straight into the depths of the cave.</p><p>In the depths of the cave, the temperature dropped sharply. It was so low that even Lu Ming shivered.</p><p>“This is … Yin block!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and discovered a small tree as thick as an arm in the cave. The terrifyingly low temperature was emitted from this small tree.</p><p>hahaha, kid, you’re rich. The yin block is a kind of ultimate Yin treasure. Just like the ultimate cold treasure, it can also integrate the energy of the core of a star and speed up the speed of my refining of the core!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the ” Liang ” character started laughing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He didn’t expect that there would be such a treasure in the 18 levels of hell.</p><p>It was obvious that the eighteen levels of hell had nurtured it after countless years. It was not very useful to the ordinary nether ape combat clan, but it was very useful to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Then I can only accept it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard. A terrifying ghostly being charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The pressure of a Godking filled the air.</p><p>as expected, the ghost king of the seventh floor is equivalent to a Divine King. Moreover, it’s a Divine King that controls divine grade divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered. This was not beyond his expectations.</p><p>The ghost king’s strength would skyrocket with every level he went down.</p><p>A first level Divine King who controlled divine-grade divine power would not be able to pass if it were any other eighth level heavenly deity.</p><p>However, it was nothing to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the quadruple combat power of the battle formula and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>The third move of the three apocalyptic strikes, exploding star.</p><p>The destructive energy surged towards the ghost king and completely enveloped it. After a few breaths, the ghost king completely disappeared.</p><p>With the death of the ghost king, all the other ghostly beings fled.</p><p>Then, the gate to the next level of hell appeared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to enter the gate of hell. Anyway, the gate of hell would not disappear if he did not enter.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the yin building block, took out a saber, and cut the yin building block in half.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pull it out by the roots. He left the roots behind so that it would continue to grow in the future.</p><p>“Old Liang, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula flew out, and a ray of light enveloped the yin building block, devouring it.</p><p>kid, if you can get more of these Yin treasures, the speed at which I refine the star core will increase greatly. By then, your cultivation speed will also increase greatly!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This was only the seventh level of hell. Lu Ming realized that the deeper he went, the heavier the ghostly Qi and the yin Qi would be. It was highly possible that a Supreme Yin treasure would be born.</p><p>If the seventh level had it, then what about the eighth, ninth, and even tenth level …</p><p>If he could find many ultimate Yin treasures, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>“Let’s go to the eighth floor!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and entered the vortex, arriving at the eighth level.</p><p>After a period of killing and searching, Lu Ming finally found the ghost king on the eighth level.</p><p>The ghost king on the eighth floor was also at the first level of the Godking realm. However, he was equivalent to a first level Godking who had awakened the divine power source.</p><p>Lu Ming also found a Yin building block in the ghost king’s dwelling place. The yin Qi was even thicker than the previous one.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the ghost, he also cut down the yin accumulation wood and let the quantity formula devour it.</p><p>there really are Yin building blocks. Let’s go to the ninth floor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning.</p><p>Previously, his goal was to complete the assessment of the dark ape battle clan. However, he now had another goal. He had to find the yin building blocks and Supreme Yin treasures to refine the energy of the star core.</p><p>Lu Ming continued his search for the spirit King on the ninth floor.</p><p>Outside, many of the underworld ape battle clan members were shocked.</p><p>he passed the eighth level! He actually passed the eighth level!</p><p>only eighth level celestial deity cultivation and he’s actually able to pass through the eighth level. Terrifying. This kind of talent is truly terrifying!</p><p>Some of the dark ape battle clan members exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>On the eighth level, even the ghost king was a first level Godking who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>This level of strength was already world-shaking.</p><p>“A peerless heaven’s favorite!”</p><p>The chief of the dark ape battle clan, Yuan Huan, muttered in a low voice. His face was filled with joy.</p><p>As for the Grand Elder of the dark ape battle clan, his expression didn’t change, and it was hard to tell what he was feeling.</p><p>however, the ghost king on the ninth floor is equivalent to a first stage Divine King who has awakened the divine power factor twice. Can he pass? ”</p><p>Someone said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
