It was shining and attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>“The ancient Origin’s word ‘battle’, the true ancient Origin’s word’ battle’!”</p><p>The patriarch of the dark ape battle clan muttered to himself. Then, his body began to tremble slightly. He appeared to be extremely excited.</p><p>“Your subordinate, Yuan Huan, the clan leader of the dark ape battle clan, greets the battle ancestor!”</p><p>Then, the clan leader of the nether ape war clan bowed to Lu Ming respectfully.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the war ancestor!”</p><p>Following that, the other powerhouses of the nether ape battle clan also bowed to Lu Ming respectfully.</p><p>However, not everyone saluted Lu Ming. A small group of people stood still and the first elder was one of them.</p><p>please get up, clan leader. Eh, why do you all call me war ancestor? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously as he quickly helped Yuan Huan, the clan leader of the underworld ape battle clan, up.</p><p>“All those years ago, my nether ape battle clan swore an oath of loyalty to war ancestor Jingyu. Now that he has fallen, and you are his successor, you are naturally our new war ancestor!”</p><p>The patriarch of the dark ape battle clan bowed. His attitude was very respectful, and he wasn’t pretending.</p><p>“So it’s like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He thought to himself,’is this what LAN Shang said? previously, the first elder wanted to kill me the moment he saw me. I was dumbfounded.’</p><p>Yuan Cong, the new war ancestor is here. Come and pay your respects!</p><p>Then, the chief of the dark ape battle clan looked at the great elder and scolded him.</p><p>“The new war ancestor? Hehe, you may admit it, but I don’t!”</p><p>Yuan Cong sneered.</p><p>“Why don’t you?”</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Back then, war ancestor Jingyu was extremely powerful. His divine might was unparalleled, and his combat strength was unparalleled. The dark ape battle clan was naturally convinced. However, this brat is only a heavenly God. What kind of future do we have if we follow him?”</p><p>Yuan Cong sneered.</p><p>his cultivation can be improved. He’s still young, so his cultivation will naturally continue to improve in the future!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Hehe, do you think cultivation can be improved just because you want to? It’s not that easy. If you don’t have exceptional talent, your achievements will be limited!”</p><p>Yuan Cong laughed disdainfully. as for him, when he attacked just now, he could only rely on the help of a metallic lifeform. Otherwise, with his own battle prowess, any Godking would be able to kill him!</p><p>“Then what do you want?” Yuan Huan frowned.</p><p>“It’s fine if you want to be the new war ancestor of our underworld ape battle clan. You just have to pass our test and enter the eighteen levels of hell. As long as you can pass the nine levels of hell, I will recognize you as the new war ancestor. I will be loyal to you and obey you. What do you think?”</p><p>Yuan Cong’s voice resounded throughout the entire area.</p><p>His words made the eyes of some of the dark ape combat clan members who had previously approved of Lu Ming light up.</p><p>That’s right, the battle ancestor’s matter was no small matter.</p><p>The dark ape battle clan had to obey the new war ancestor unconditionally. This was related to the rise and fall of the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>If the new war ancestor’s talent was ordinary and his cultivation base was ordinary in the future, what could he achieve by following this person?</p><p>Perhaps, the underworld ape battle clan would be forced to walk on a path of no return.</p><p>I think the great elder is right. This person must pass the test before he can become the new war ancestor!</p><p>that’s right. You’ll pass as long as you can pass the ninth level of the eighteen levels of hell!</p><p>Some of the powerhouses on the side of the first elder spoke up.</p><p>“We aren’t looking down on war ancestor, but what the great elder said is reasonable. We would like to trouble war ancestor to participate in the test. If war ancestor doesn’t agree to the test, we will send him out of ghost hunter safely!”</p><p>At this moment, an old nether ape who had acknowledged Lu Ming from the start also spoke.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The chief of the dark ape battle clan, Yuan Huan, was in a difficult position.</p><p>“Alright, I agree to participate in the assessment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>He had experienced a lot along the way and naturally understood one thing. If you want others to believe you, you have to show them something worthy of their trust.</p><p>Strength was capital, talent was also capital.</p><p>Therefore, if he wanted to subdue the dark ape battle clan, he would have to show them what he had. Only then would he be able to use the entire clan.</p><p>Back then, Jing Yu had not only relied on the ‘battle’ symbol art to subdue the underworld ape battle clan, but also his immense strength.</p><p>Since he was not strong enough, he could only rely on his talent.</p><p>alright, clan leader, you’ve heard it as well. He himself has agreed to participate in the assessment!</p><p>The first elder’s eyes lit up as he stared at the clan leader.</p><p>alright, I’ll take the test then. The eighteen levels of hell will be opened in three months!</p><p>The chief of the dark ape battle clan, Yuan Huan, finally made his decision.</p><p>Seeing Yuan Huan give the order, first elder revealed a smile.</p><p>The eighteen levels of hell were not that easy to pass. Every level was very difficult, and to pass all nine levels was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>If Lu Ming could not pass the ninth level, there was a good reason to send him away. If he really passed the ninth level, it meant that he was shockingly talented. Then, what was wrong with acknowledging Lu Ming as the war ancestor?</p><p>“Let’s go back to the clan!”</p><p>Yuan Huan gave the order and Lu Ming immediately followed Yuan Huan and the rest as they flew forward.</p><p>After flying for a while, huge ancient trees appeared in front of them.</p><p>These ancient trees were really huge. There were many that were more than a hundred meters in diameter. Some of them were even more than a thousand meters in diameter. Their crowns reached into the clouds. It was a magnificent sight to see all these ancient trees.</p><p>At a glance, there were figures leaping back and forth between the ancient trees. They were all members of the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised that the nether ape war clan lived on these ancient trees.</p><p>After returning to this place, the experts left one after another.</p><p>After that, someone arranged a place for Lu Ming to stay. Not long after, Lu Ming came to an ancient tree that was a few hundred meters in diameter.</p><p>Between the branches of the ancient tree, there was a courtyard that was quite elegant.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. On this day, a dark ape came and said that the chief of the dark ape battle clan had invited him.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the other party and came to a huge tree with a diameter of more than five thousand meters. They entered a Hall on a branch.</p><p>“Greetings, chief ape!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists slightly.</p><p>war ancestor, I can’t use you. This subordinate greets war ancestor!</p><p>Yuan Huan hurriedly bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why did the patriarch call me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>regarding the test, I don’t think the war ancestor knows the details of the test of the eighteen levels of hell!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“I really don’t know. Please tell me, patriarch!”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>the 18 levels of hell is a special place in the ghost domain. It’s not worth mentioning to us, but it’s really difficult for you young people to pass through!</p><p>the eighteen levels of hell can be said to be a training ground for the younger generation of the underworld ape battle clan. There are a total of eighteen levels, and each level is more difficult than the previous. Even a first level Divine King genius wouldn’t be able to pass through all nine levels, let alone you, who is only at the eighth level of the heavenly deity realm!</p><p>Yuan Huan explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
