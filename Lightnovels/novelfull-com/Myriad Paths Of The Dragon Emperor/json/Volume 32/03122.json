Once he did, it would be easy to deal with Chu Wei.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not want to use his ancient God Body for the time being.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming, nine ice chains flew out like nine long snakes, entangling Chu Wei.</p><p>The nine ice chains easily passed through the waves of Qi and swept towards Chu Wei.</p><p>Before the ice chains even reached him, the terrifying chill had already caused Chu Wei’s expression to change.</p><p>“War god gallops!”</p><p>Chu Wei roared loudly. The Spear’s momentum changed again, emitting even more terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>.com</p><p>In the sky, another ‘God of War’ formed. However, this God of War was a little different from the one before.</p><p>This war god was riding on a huge War Horse.</p><p>With that, the God of War’s movements became much more agile.</p><p>Chu Wei himself was standing on the head of the God of War.</p><p>The warhorse stomped in the air and the sky rumbled. It flashed like a Phantom and escaped the range of the ice chains, charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A huge spearlight shot toward Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>“It’s really strange that the God of War’s strike can be used like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The nine ice chains retracted rapidly. He barely managed to form a wall. The Spear’s gleam struck the wall formed by the ice chains and was successfully blocked.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level grew, the power of the ice chain grew stronger and its defense increased as well.</p><p>After blocking the attack, the ice chain moved and immediately counterattacked, winding towards Chu Wei.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming punched out continuously with both fists. Fifteen nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed in the sky and pounced on Chu Wei from all directions, roaring furiously, cutting off his retreat.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>After casting the divine Dragon phenomenon, Lu Ming immediately took out his long spear and cast the ‘moon-cutting’ technique, slashing it at Chu Weili.</p><p>A crescent-shaped spear light was sent towards Chu Wei.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast three types of attack techniques. His attacks were like a storm.</p><p>Chu Wei’s expression was extremely serious. He also used all his means to resist with all his strength.</p><p>He was the first to swing away the ice chains, but the nine-clawed Divine Dragon immediately followed up with an attack. When he blocked the nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s attack, the ‘moon-slaying’ came again.</p><p>In the end, Chu Wei did not manage to block the moon-slaying sword and was struck on the head of the God of War. The God of War shook violently and exploded.</p><p>The surging force rushed towards Chu Wei. Chu Wei’s body was pushed back tens of thousands of meters, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give Chu Wei any chance to catch his breath. He charged forward with his spear. In an instant, three crescent-shaped spearlights slashed at Chu Wei.</p><p>Chu Wei was injured and could not use much of his strength. Even if he tried his best, it would be useless.</p><p>He barely managed to block two crescent-shaped spearlights, but he couldn’t block the third.</p><p>The third crescent-shaped spear light hit Chu Wei, sending him flying 100000 meters away from the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Chu Wei crashed heavily into the ground and slid for tens of thousands of meters, leaving deep ravines on the ground. Chu Wei lay in the ravines, blood constantly spurting out of his mouth, and his breath was extremely weak.</p><p>The armor on his body was split open and he was almost cut in half.</p><p>Chu Wei was defeated!</p><p>The entire place was silent!</p><p>Many people who were watching Lu Ming fight for the first time were really shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He was only a seventh-level celestial deity, but he had defeated Chu Wei.</p><p>Chu Wei was not an ordinary Divine King. He was a prodigy Divine King who had mastered divine-grade divine power. However, he was still not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>This level of combat strength was truly shocking.</p><p>phew, scary, it’s really scary!</p><p>Many people let out a long breath, their faces full of shock.</p><p>what nine blades Heavenly King mansion? what war god clan? they can’t even withstand a single blow!</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at Chu Wei and said indifferently.</p><p>This made Chu Wei and Chu Batian’s faces turn extremely ugly.</p><p>Humiliation, this was a great humiliation.</p><p>There were many geniuses in the war god clan’s generation. Initially, they wanted to rise to power. However, they were continuously defeated by Lu Ming. This was undoubtedly a major blow to the reputation of the war god clan.</p><p>“Arrogant brat, do you think you can insult the war god clan? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Who are you? ” a cold chiding voice came from the distance. Then, a group of young men came over.</p><p>There were more than 20 people in this group of young men. Most of them carried sabers on their backs, and their auras were as sharp as blades.</p><p>it’s the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>It was obvious that more heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had arrived.</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion who had been nearby were only a small part of the group. At this moment, even more had arrived.</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon was extremely fast. In a few breaths, he had arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the young men was very overbearing. He slashed at Lu Ming from a distance.</p><p>A huge astral saber, which spanned hundreds of miles, slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The air in the sky churned, bringing with it a terrifying howl, as if it was going to split the area in half.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly!</p><p>The other party had slashed from such a distance. However, the power of this slash made Lu Ming’s expression turn grave. This was because the power of this slash had already surpassed Chu Wei’s strongest attack.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>attack! Lu Ming growled and waved his hands rapidly. Dragon roars were heard and fifteen nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed and pounced forward.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains flew out and formed a layer of defense in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s body, a nine-layered Crimson Gold armor appeared.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, a violent explosion was heard. The fifteen nine-clawed divine Dragons crumbled continuously as they were defeated one by one.</p><p>Then, the saber slashed at the defensive wall where the ice chains intertwined.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>As the sparks fought, the ice chains trembled and finally cracked. The terrifying saber Qi passed through the crack and slashed at the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he drifted backward. He only stopped when he reached the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The young man who had attacked just now was also at the first level of the divine King realm. However, he had already awakened the origin divine power factor, so his combat strength was much stronger than Chu Wei’s.</p><p>“It’s the origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Sensing the aura on this person’s body, the others also cried out in surprise.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The young man took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring, his cold aura enveloping Lu Ming.</p><p>who gave you the guts to insult the nine blades heavenly mansion and the God of War clan? ”</p><p>“So arrogant. Come, fight me!”</p><p>The young man shouted coldly. He was arrogant and overbearing. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, he was confident that he could easily crush him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
