He dodged the black Shadow’s attack in a flash and retreated a distance. Then, he glanced over and saw the black Shadow’s appearance clearly.</p><p>It was a ferocious-looking ghostly being. Its eyes were wide open as it glared at Lu Ming. Its mouth was wide open, and it was filled with greed.</p><p>“Eat, eat, eat, I want to eat, give me your life!”</p><p>The ghost shrieked and pounced at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“This is the Hungry Ghost?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had done some research while he was in the dark ape battle clan, so he had some understanding of the ghosts in the ghost hunter.</p><p>The ghost in front of him was the legendary Hungry Ghost.</p><p>This Hungry Ghost was only at the eighth-level celestial deity realm. To Lu Ming, it was not worth mentioning.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the force of his fist penetrated the Hungry Ghost, turning it into dust.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>“Hand over your life!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming killed the Hungry Ghost, he could hear the sounds of fighting coming from all directions. At least a few dozen hungry ghosts were pouncing on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sun Shen power!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the divine power of the sun and a layer of flames appeared on the surface of his body. His entire person was like a sun, shining brightly.</p><p>These ghosts were most afraid of the power of extreme yang, such as Saint power, fire power, lightning power, and so on. They were all the nemesis of these ghosts.</p><p>The dozens of hungry ghosts were enveloped by the light from Lu Ming’s body. Like ice that had come into contact with fire, they melted rapidly. In the blink of an eye, not a single one was left. They all turned into black smoke and dissipated.</p><p>After killing these ghosts, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left the place. He was looking for the king of hungry ghosts on the first level of hell.</p><p>However, a few hours later, Lu Ming had searched a large area and killed a large number of hungry ghouls, but he could not find the king of hungry ghouls.</p><p>The main thing was that the first level of hell was too large, like a small world. It was easier said than done to find a ghost king.</p><p>Lu Ming held his temper and continued to search.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming came to a Valley.</p><p>The ghostly Qi in the valley was much denser than in other places.</p><p>such dense ghost Qi. Is the ghost king of this level here? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, he rushed into the valley.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming charged into the valley, it was as if he had rushed into a hornet’s nest. Countless hungry ghosts screeched as they charged at Lu Ming. They were so densely packed that it was impossible to count how many there were.</p><p>“Sun Shen power!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the divine power of the sun to the extreme and turned into a sun. The light shone in all directions and all the hungry ghosts that were shone on by the sunlight turned into black smoke.</p><p>Although there were many hungry ghouls, most of them were eighth-level celestial deities or below. They did not pose any threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the depths of the valley with ease.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a particularly large Hungry Ghost rushing toward him.</p><p>“Ninth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that this huge Hungry Ghost had the cultivation of a ninth-level celestial deity. However, it was only equivalent to the most ordinary ninth-level celestial deity.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared. This nine-clawed Divine Dragon was condensed with the sun Shen power as the core.</p><p>The moment the nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced on the body of the massive starved ghost, it was easily torn apart by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, and it also turned into black smoke and dissipated.</p><p>After the giant Hungry Ghost was killed, the other hungry ghosts screamed and stopped attacking Lu Ming. Instead, they fled backward. In the blink of an eye, not a single one of them was left.</p><p>At this moment, the space in front of Lu Ming rippled and a dark vortex appeared.</p><p>this is the door to the next level of hell. It seems that the giant Hungry Ghost just now was the ghost king of this level!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>As long as the ghost king of the first level was killed, the gate to the next level of hell would automatically appear.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and stepped into the vortex. The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in another layer of hell.</p><p>Outside, Yuan Huan, Yuan Cong, and the others had been watching.</p><p>At this moment, the second level of the human-sized stone tower suddenly lit up.</p><p>“The second level!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>Everyone’s expression did not change. The first level of the eighteen levels of hell was very simple. The ghost king’s cultivation was only at the ninth level of the heavenly deity realm, so killing him was very easy.</p><p>They were not surprised at all. They would be more surprised if Lu Ming could not even pass the first level.</p><p>The second level of the eighteen levels of hell.</p><p>Lu Ming was soon besieged when he appeared. This time, it was not the hungry ghosts that attacked him. Instead, it was another kind of ghost, the big-headed ghost.</p><p>This kind of ghostly being had a huge head and was extremely hard.</p><p>However, their cultivation levels were not high. They were not much different from the first level. Lu Ming easily killed a large number of big-headed ghosts and then searched for the big-headed ghost king in this hell.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was not very lucky. It took him more than ten days to find the big-headed ghost king and kill it.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that this big-headed ghost King’s cultivation was also at the ninth-level celestial deity realm.</p><p>However, it was still stronger than the king of hungry ghosts.</p><p>The king of Hungry Ghost had the strength of an ordinary ninth level celestial deity, while the big-headed ghost king was a ninth level celestial deity who had mastered divine-grade divine power.</p><p>After killing the big-headed ghost king, the gates of hell appeared and Lu Ming entered the third level.</p><p>The ghosts on the third floor were different from the ones on the first two floors.</p><p>He was also slightly stronger.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered a problem. The deeper he went, the larger the area of hell would be. Naturally, it would be more difficult to find the ghost king.</p><p>Moreover, there were ghosts everywhere. While Lu Ming was looking for the ghost king, he had to fight non-stop.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming took a longer time. He spent a month and a half before he found the ghost king of the third level of hell and killed it.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming discovered that the ghost king on the third level was also at the ninth-level celestial deity realm. However, it was a level stronger than the ghost king on the second level.</p><p>It was equivalent to a ninth level heavenly deity who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>After spending more than two months, he passed the third level and entered the fourth level.</p><p>As soon as he entered the fourth level, Lu Ming felt that it was a little different.</p><p>The cold wind whistled, and the aura became even more oppressive.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the ground cracked and a skeleton rushed out. It held a rusty saber and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he shattered the skeleton with one strike.</p><p>However, the ground continued to crack open, and skeletons kept rushing out to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>With a shake of the spear, hundreds of spearlights burst out in an instant, crushing hundreds of skeletons in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and left in a flash.</p><p>The fourth level of hell was an ocean of skeletons, and their numbers were astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to fight with these skeletons. He unleashed the nine Heavens kun Peng technique with all his might, soaring through the nine Heavens like a kun Peng in search of the Skeleton King on this level.</p><p>However, the surface area of the fourth layer was much larger than the third layer.</p><p>Moreover, the king of skeletons was hidden underground, making it even more difficult to find.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a total of three months before he found the Skeleton King.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
