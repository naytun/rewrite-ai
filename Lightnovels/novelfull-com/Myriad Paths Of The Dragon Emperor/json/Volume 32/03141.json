Lu Ming shouted as he stepped into the air and headed toward Yuan Yu. The ‘door of domination’ followed closely behind him, emitting a dazzling radiance as it continued to blast toward Yuan Yu.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Yuan Yu shouted. The saber in his hand floated in the air, and his hands kept forming seals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle blade trembled, and a blade light soared into the sky. It then directly flew out and slashed at the ‘door of domination’.</p><p>This was a ‘saber riding’ technique, and its attack power was astonishing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber struck the ‘gate of domination’, producing the sound of metal clashing and sparks flying in all directions.</p><p>However, the gate of God was unscathed. Instead, the battle blade was sent flying.</p><p>After the saber was sent flying, it made a turn and flew past the door of domination, heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to bypass the door of domination and kill Lu Ming directly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already expected this move. The door of domination flashed and returned to the top of Lu Ming’s head at an astonishing speed, continuing to attack the saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The battle blade continued to be sent flying.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Then, a whooshing sound came from the gate of God, and a terrifying suction force burst out.</p><p>The door of domination only had a single frame made of stone. It was empty in the middle and pitch-black.</p><p>At this moment, the pitch-black area began to spin, like a pitch-black hole.</p><p>The terrifying suction force immediately enveloped the saber. The saber vibrated, but it was stopped by the suction force and could not move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the ruler’s Gate attacked Yuan Yu.</p><p>Yuan Yu’s expression changed. He had lost his saber, so he quickly took out another one from his storage ring and slashed out.</p><p>When the blade light hit the gate of domination, the gate only trembled, but the blade light shattered.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the door of domination to bombard Yuan Yu. Yuan Yu could only try his best to resist.</p><p>The two of them were completely fighting the strong with the strong, constantly colliding with each other, and their forces overflowed.</p><p>However, in terms of attack power, the two were similar.</p><p>However, the suction force from the God’s Gate had severely affected Yuan Yu’s performance. He had to use divine power to resist the suction force. After a dozen moves, Yuan Yu was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Yuan Yu was slowly losing and was forced to retreat. His body was trembling slightly, and it was obvious that he was under great pressure.</p><p>Everyone who saw this scene could not help but widen their eyes.</p><p>Yuan Yu was actually losing. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity, how could he have such combat strength?</p><p>origin secret skill! It’s origin secret skill!</p><p>Outside the formation, Heavenly King Nine blades roared in disbelief.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine sabers had roamed the starry sky for countless years and had seen all kinds of storms and waves. However, at this moment, he could not suppress the fluctuations in his heart and had completely lost his composure.</p><p>He could tell that Lu Ming was using the ‘origin secret skill’.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming was besieged by Duan Jiang and the others, he had fallen into a state of life and death and comprehended the origin secret technique. However, at that time, he had just comprehended the ‘door of domination’ and it was faintly discernible. After one attack, it had dispersed. Therefore, the nine blade Heavenly King and the others did not recognize that it was the ‘origin secret technique’.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming was constantly attacking, the nine saber Heavenly King could naturally recognize him with his knowledge.</p><p>“What? The origin secret skill?”</p><p>“Heavens!”</p><p>Upon hearing the nine blade Heavenly King’s words, many people exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Why did so many paragons enter the formation and fight to the death?</p><p>It was to fight for the divine power Pearl and awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>One could only imagine how difficult it was to awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>Yuan Yu was a genius. He had awakened the origin divine power factor for the second time at the first tier of the king God Realm. He could be said to be an astonishing talent, but he still had a long way to go before he could awaken the origin secret technique.</p><p>He wanted to get the divine power origin bead to awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming did not do anything and he had awakened the origin secret skill.</p><p>A seventh level celestial deity not only awakened the origin divine power factor, but also the origin secret technique.</p><p>This could no longer be described as monstrous. He was simply a freak, a monster, a miracle …</p><p>The shock of these people could be imagined.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>Nine absolutes Heavenly King was also shocked at first, but he quickly reacted and laughed.</p><p>This time, the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor actually produced such a genius. He would definitely shine during the great void Royal sacred Academy’s conference and might even be valued by the sacred Emperor.</p><p>As for the clan heads and experts of the three great clans, the Jin clan, the winged people clan, and the Qin clan, their expressions were extremely unsightly.</p><p>Many geniuses from the three major aristocratic families had died at Lu Ming’s hands. It could be said that they would not rest until one of them was dead. The stronger Lu Ming was, the more worried they were.</p><p>“I must find a way to get rid of this brat!”</p><p>The heads of the aristocratic families all had the same thought.</p><p>Within the formation, the battle continued.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yuan Yu exchanged more than ten moves. Yuan Yu finally could not take it anymore and his saber was sent flying. Under the violent pressure of the door of domination, Yuan Yu’s body shook violently and he was sent flying like a cannonball, coughing up blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to control the ‘master’s Gate’ to bombard Yuan Yu.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   Yuan Yu roared, his hand like a blade as he sent blade-light at the gate of God.</p><p>However, with his injured body and his hands, he couldn’t block the gate of God.</p><p>After a loud boom, Yuan Yu screamed and was sent flying. Blood spurted out of his mouth. His palms had exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll remember what happened today. Next time, I’ll pay you back ten times over!”</p><p>Yuan Yu bellowed before turning into a blade of light and flying off into the distance. His speed was astonishing, and he disappeared without a trace after a few flashes.</p><p>Yuan Yu had actually escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. In fact, he did not have the ability to give chase now.</p><p>&Nbsp; after all, he had just comprehended the God’s Gate, and after the battle with Yuan Yu, he felt like he was about to lose control.</p><p>If Yuan Yu had been able to last a little longer, he would have been the one to lose.</p><p>He circulated his divine power and the door of the master above Lu Ming’s head disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in the sky. He grabbed the divine power origin Pearl in his hand.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming wanted to put the divine power origin bead into the storage ring but he was slightly stunned. He did not expect that the divine power origin bead could not be put into the storage ring.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Yuan Yu was actually defeated by Lu Ming. They had not even dreamed of this scene.</p><p>As for Zhao Mo, the Wu family’s leader, and the rest, they heaved a long sigh of relief. Their feelings were also extremely complicated.</p><p>They were well aware of how powerful Yuan Yu was. Previously, Yuan Yu had easily crushed the leading figure of the winged man family with a single move. However, Lu Ming was able to defeat Yuan Yu. Didn’t this mean that Lu Ming’s abilities could easily crush them as well?</p><p>A seventh level celestial deity could easily crush them in combat strength. If someone said this to them previously, they would definitely scoff.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
