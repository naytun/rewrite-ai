This way, the news of him getting the divine power origin bead wouldn’t be leaked so quickly, and he could buy more time.</p><p>If he was lucky, he might be able to delay it for a month.</p><p>you guys, stall the sun family’s people. I’ll kill the Xu family’s people!</p><p>Jin Xiang sent a message to the geniuses of the Jin family.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert from Jin clan’s eyes flickered a few times. He nodded silently and suddenly moved, pouncing towards the heaven’s pride expert from sun clan.</p><p>The Golden Elephant turned into a golden lightning bolt and rushed toward the remaining three young men of the Xu family.</p><p>“Not good, he’s going to kill us!”</p><p>One of the Xu family’s elites was shocked.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>The three Xu family elites wanted to retreat and escape.</p><p>However, of the three remaining Xu family heaven’s favorites, two were half-step divine kings and one was a Divine King, but he was severely injured. Their speed was far from the Golden Elephant’s.</p><p>The Golden Elephant flashed and caught up with the three Xu clan heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The golden sword light slashed toward the three Xu family elites.</p><p>Blood spurted out and three screams were heard. The remaining three paragons of the Xu family were all killed.</p><p>“Jin family, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“I’ll exterminate you all!”</p><p>Outside the formation, the Xu family’s experts were completely enraged after witnessing this scene. They were like wild beasts, their eyes bloodshot as they charged towards the Jin family’s experts.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Do you want to rebel? When you enter the formation, you must be prepared to be killed. If you can’t afford to play, then you shouldn’t have sent people in!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted coldly, and a violent aura spread out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The auras of the master of the Jin family and the master of the Xu family collided, causing a huge wave.</p><p>The war between the two families started at once.</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying aura pressed down on them, causing the faces of the experts from the two families to change.</p><p>Because this aura came from Heavenly King Nine cuts.</p><p>“Since we’re going in to fight for the treasure, killing is inevitable. I’ll say something. Since we’ve sent people in to fight for the treasure, we should be prepared to be killed. Don’t bring the grudges inside to the outside and don’t be laughed at by others, understand?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts said coldly.</p><p>“The Heavenly King is wise!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The head of the Xu family and the experts of the Xu family could only lower their heads.</p><p>However, they were still filled with resentment.</p><p>The nine sabers Heavenly King sneered. Once a conflict was triggered, it was not something that could be resolved with a few words from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Now, the nine extremes Heavenly King was suppressed, but in the future, the conflicts between the big families would definitely not be suppressed.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>At this moment, the experts of the sun family were also worried.</p><p>It was obvious that Jin Xiang wanted to silence them. After killing the Xu family’s heaven’s pride expert, he was going to kill the sun family’s heaven’s pride expert.</p><p>Jin Xiang, let us go. We promise we won’t tell anyone about you getting the divine power Pearl!</p><p>At this moment, a heaven’s favorite from the sun family shouted.</p><p>As first level godkings, the difference in strength between those who had awakened the divine power factor and those who had not was too great.</p><p>If Jin Xiang wanted to kill them, it wouldn’t be difficult at all with the help of the other geniuses of the Jin clan.</p><p>“Swear on your life essence that you won’t tell anyone. I’ll let you go!”</p><p>Jin Xiang’s eyes flickered a few times before he said.</p><p>The sun family had a good relationship with the Jin and Qin families.</p><p>Back then in star-moon ancient city, the Qin family had even invited the sun family to kill Lu Ming together.</p><p>Therefore, after some consideration, Jin Xiang decided to let the sun family off so as not to ruin the relationship between the two families.</p><p>“Alright, we swear!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the sun family nodded quickly and then swore on his life source.</p><p>“You guys can leave!”</p><p>After the sun family’s people swore on their life source, Jin Xiang waved his hand, signaling them to leave.</p><p>The People of the Sun family were overjoyed and were about to leave.</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying howl was heard. Not far away, a stone spear flew over at a terrifying speed, aiming for a first level Divine King genius of the Jin family.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the Jin clan had already relaxed after Jin Xiang’s arrival. He had never expected that someone would attack him. It was too late to resist.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The first level Divine King genius of the Jin clan had his head pierced by the stone spear and died on the spot.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Golden Elephant was furious. It looked in the direction where the stone spear came from, as if it wanted to eat someone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In that direction, a figure flashed and a tall young man appeared.</p><p>“Xu Yan, it’s Xu Yan!”</p><p>“Haha, well done!”</p><p>Outside the formation, the Xu family experts were overjoyed.</p><p>The experts of the Jin family had gloomy faces. The death of a first level Divine King made their hearts ache.</p><p>“Xu Yan, it’s you!”</p><p>Jin Xiang’s eyes stared at Xu Yan, filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Xu Yan’s gaze swept over the Xu clan’s Paragon’s corpse, and his eyes were extremely cold. Jin Xiang, you’ve killed so many of my Xu clan’s elites. I’ll make you pay with your blood!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xu Yan’s body exploded with a terrifying aura.</p><p>The God King realm. Xu Yan’s cultivation base was at the God King realm.</p><p>Back in star-moon ancient city, Xu Yan’s cultivation level was only at the half-step Godking realm. However, after a life-and-death battle with si Ji of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, Xu Yan had gained a lot from killing si Ji. He went back and entered seclusion for a period of time before successfully breaking through to the Godking realm.</p><p>Xu Yan had awakened the origin divine power factor when he was only a half-step Divine King. After he broke through to the divine King realm, his strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>“So what if I killed your Xu family’s people? today, I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>die! Jin Xiang shouted as he used the void-breaking sword and slashed toward Xu Yan.</p><p>Xu Yan wasn’t afraid at all. Another stone spear condensed in his palm. He swept the stone spear horizontally and attacked the Golden Elephant.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The void-breaking sword collided with the stone spear, causing a shocking boom and a powerful force to spread.</p><p>The force was like a wave, sweeping in all directions. The ground kept cracking under the terrifying force.</p><p>Xu Yan’s body trembled and he retreated in the direction of the remaining five heaven’s favorites from the Jin clan.</p><p>“Not good! Xu Yan, you dare?”</p><p>Jin Xiang’s expression changed and he roared.</p><p>He could tell that Xu Yan had exchanged a blow with him and had deliberately borrowed her power to rush toward the elites of the Jin clan.</p><p>Xu Yan’s target was the other geniuses of the Jin clan.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites of the Jin clan were shocked and scattered.</p><p>However, Xu Yan had already locked onto one person, and the stone spear pierced out.</p><p>With the help of the Golden Elephant, Xu Yan’s speed was extremely fast. The power of the stone spear was even more shocking.</p><p>This heaven’s favorite of the Jin clan was also a God King. He naturally wasn’t willing to be killed. With a loud roar, his entire body glowed with a golden light as he executed the void severing palm. His palm slashed towards the stone spear, hoping to block Xu Yan’s attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
