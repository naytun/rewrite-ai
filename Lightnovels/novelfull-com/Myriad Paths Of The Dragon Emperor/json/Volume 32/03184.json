Then, he, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling chose a random direction and flew forward.</p><p>Soon, they were tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>While Lu Ming was flying, he saw many huge beasts fighting with some experts.</p><p>These huge beasts were hundreds of meters tall and had a wild aura. They were the swordbone beasts.</p><p>The cultivation of these sword bone beasts was not high. Along the way, he found that most of them were at the first level of King God Realm.</p><p>However, these swordbone beasts were being watched.</p><p>There were too many people coming in, it was simply more wolves than meat.</p><p>The three of them were helpless and could only fly further away.</p><p>He flew for another tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>“Guys, look! It’s a swordbone beast!”</p><p>Qiu Yue pointed to the front and shouted.</p><p>A few sword bone beasts were digging into the ground in front of them, digging for metal to eat.</p><p>“Quick, do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>He had to hurry up, or else the sword bone beast would be taken away again.</p><p>The three of them turned into three streaks of light and flew toward the swordbone beast.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The swordbone beast noticed Lu Ming and his group and roared as it attacked them.</p><p>Pieces of bone flew out of the swordbone beasts ‘bodies and slashed at Lu Ming and the other two like flying swords.</p><p>However, these swordbone beasts were only at the first level of the God King realm. Even LAN Ling could easily kill them, let alone Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two’s attacks landed on the swordbone beast, causing it to explode and debris to fly everywhere.</p><p>The three sword bone beasts were killed in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two landed beside the swordbone beast and began to search for the sword bones.</p><p>The structure of the sword bone beast was very strange. It was not made of flesh and blood, but made of rocks and metal.</p><p>Finally, the three of them found a finger-sized black bone banner on the spine of the sword bone beast. The bone banner was in the shape of a sword, and an invisible sword pressure was emanating from it.</p><p>They knew that these were the sword bones that the bone sword clan needed.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and took the sword bone.</p><p>“It’s only about ten Jin!”</p><p>Lu Ming held it in his hand and weighed it. He was rather speechless.</p><p>The sword bones of a swordbone beast were only about five kilograms. He would have to kill a hundred of them in exchange for a day of cultivation under the sacred heaven Jade wall.</p><p>It seemed like it would not be easy to cultivate under the sacred heaven Jade wall.</p><p>After that, Qiu Yue and LAN Ling removed the sword bones one after another. They were about the same as Lu Ming, weighing about ten pounds.</p><p>“Let’s go and continue hunting!”</p><p>Immediately, the three of them rose into the air and continued their hunt.</p><p>However, there were too many people at the beginning of the journey. Lu Ming and the rest saw many people fighting over the swordbone beast.</p><p>there are many sword bone beasts in this world, so there’s no need to compete here. Let’s go deeper first!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>The three of them didn’t stop. They increased their speed and flew into the depths of the world.</p><p>As they went deeper in, the crowd also constantly dispersed, and finally there were not so many people.</p><p>“There’s another one in front!”</p><p>Qiu Yue cried out in surprise.</p><p>In front of them, there were at least five or six sword bone beasts. The three of them flew forward and killed them.</p><p>He then continued his search.</p><p>With fewer people, it would be much easier to find the sword bone beasts. They would be able to find them from time to time.</p><p>This kind of sword bone beast would not only stay on the ground, but also hide underground.</p><p>Their bodies seemed to be made of a mixture of rock and metal. For example, when they slept, they would hide underground. Sometimes, when they were defeated, they would hide underground, which was a troublesome thing.</p><p>They had to sense carefully to find the swordbone beast.</p><p>Just like that, after more than a day, Lu Ming and the other two had each obtained about 250 kilograms of black sword bones. They could cultivate under the sacred heaven Jade wall for about half a day.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The three of them were searching for the sword bone beast in a barren mountain when suddenly, a loud roar was heard. The ground cracked and a sharp claw swiped towards LAN Ling with great power.</p><p>LAN Ling was shocked and quickly waved his sword to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sharp claws struck LAN Ling’s sword. Even with LAN Ling’s cultivation, she was unable to withstand the attack. Her body trembled violently and she was sent flying.</p><p>Then, a sword bone beast rushed out from the ground.</p><p>This sword bone beast was different from the ones they had encountered before, it was much smaller.</p><p>The previous swordbone beasts had been around a hundred meters tall, but this one was only twenty meters tall.</p><p>“Third level of King God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He could sense that the sword bone beast was at the third level of the God King realm. No wonder LAN Ling couldn’t withstand it and was sent flying.</p><p>In the divine King realm, the higher one’s cultivation was, the more powerful one would be.</p><p>It wasn’t something that could be crossed with a few simple secret techniques.</p><p>LAN Ling’s talent was very high, and the power of her divine skills and secret Arts was also very strong. She had also awakened the origin divine power factor. Even so, she could only suppress or kill an ordinary second level Divine King at most. She was definitely no match for a third level Divine King.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The swordbone beast let out a loud roar and charged at LAN Ling again.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and stood in front of the swordbone beast. With a punch, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon formed and pounced at the swordbone beast, clashing with its sharp claws.</p><p>A muffled explosion was heard and the sword bone beast was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and punched out with both his fists. A total of thirty-six nine-clawed divine Dragons came out and pounced on the swordbone beast.</p><p>After a series of explosions, the swordbone beast was covered in wounds and lay on the ground, dead.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current strength, it was not difficult for him to kill an ordinary third firmament Divine King. He did not even need to use his origin secret skill.</p><p>Of course, the opponents that he would face during the opening ceremony of the great void Royal sacred Academy would not be ordinary godkings. They would all be top-tier geniuses.</p><p>“Hmph, who needs you to save me? I can handle it myself!”</p><p>LAN Ling flew over and said stubbornly.</p><p>“Wipe the blood off your mouth first!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>LAN Ling snorted coldly and did not say anything else.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and took the sword bone from the swordbone beast.</p><p>“Silver!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The sword bones of this sword bone beast were silver in color, and they were not light, weighing at least thirty pounds.</p><p>30 Jin of silver sword bone was equivalent to 300 Jin of black sword bone.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it without any hesitation. He would not discuss with LAN Ling about splitting it equally. If he wanted to split it equally, he would do so with Qiu Yue.</p><p>Next, they moved more carefully.</p><p>Since there was a third level Divine King realm sword bone beast, there would be a second one, a third one …</p><p>As expected, the level of the sword bone beasts had increased by quite a bit.</p><p>Not only the first sky of King God Realm, but the second and third sky of King God Realm also appeared occasionally. Their speed of collection had increased a lot.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had already been here for a month.</p><p>On this day, they were flying in search of the sword bone beast when they suddenly stopped.</p><p>This was because a few young men in front of them were blocking their way.</p><p>It was the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
