He looked down at Lu Ming and said coldly, ” “You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>“That’s right. Sir, why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“My young master is looking for you. Please come with me!”</p><p>LAN Jiu instructed, then turned to leave.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had to follow his instructions.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood there without moving. He looked at LAN Jiu as if he was looking at a fool.</p><p>LAN Jiu also noticed that Lu Ming had not moved. He stopped and turned around, frowning.”You’re still not coming with me?”</p><p>“Who are you? We’re close?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and was rather speechless. This brother was too confident.</p><p>Oh, indeed. I haven’t introduced myself yet!</p><p>LAN Jiu smiled faintly and said, ” my young master is the young master of the great void Holy capital’s LAN family. LAN Feng. The great void Holy capital’s LAN family is not something that your mere nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion can compare to. Do you understand? ” My young master is looking for you. Come with me!”</p><p>After saying that, LAN Jiu turned around again and realized that Lu Ming had not moved.</p><p>“You’re still not leaving?”</p><p>LAN Jiu’s expression turned cold.</p><p>“So it’s that LAN Feng, why is he looking for me?” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>“The LAN family? I’ve never heard of him before. Your young master has come to find me for some matters. Tell him to come and visit himself. I won’t see him out!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sleeves and asked him to leave.</p><p>“What? You’re asking my young master to pay you a visit? little brat, you’re such a big dog egg, Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Blue Nine’s expression changed and he roared.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Ever since LAN Shang told him about the LAN family, his impression of the LAN family had always been very bad. Now that LAN Feng had actually asked a servant to act high and mighty in front of him, it would be strange if he had a good expression.</p><p>you’re looking for death. If you don’t go, I’ll break your legs and bring you to young master!</p><p>LAN Jiu let out a furious roar. Then, his palm was like a knife as he struck out continuously. Two beams of divine light were aimed at Lu Ming’s legs.</p><p>LAN Jiu had a first tier Divine King cultivation. He was very confident that this move could cripple Lu Ming’s legs.</p><p>“You’re really looking for a beating!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He initially wanted to ignore the other party, but the other party wanted to court death. He really had no choice.</p><p>The divine power condensed into a long spear. With a shake of the long spear, two rays of spear light burst out and destroyed the divine light that LAN Jiu had slashed out.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and closed in on LAN Jiu in an instant. The Spear’s gleam was like a mountain as it bombarded him.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>LAN Jiu turned pale with fright. He had never expected that Lu Ming, who was only an eighth-level celestial deity, would be this powerful. He roared and a blue lustrous sword light rushed out of his body, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, although LAN Jiu had mastered the divine-grade divine power, he had not awakened the origin divine power factor. The difference between him and Lu Ming was too great.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already activated the fourfold combat power of the battle character formula. The Spear’s gleam was as heavy as a mountain. It crushed down and bombarded The Blue Sword gleam.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword light shook violently and then collapsed. The spear light hit LAN Jiu’s body. LAN Jiu screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body fell to the ground like a cannonball and smashed into the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and stepped on one of LAN Jiu’s legs.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The sound of bones breaking and LAN Jiu’s screams spread far and wide.</p><p>“Lu Ming has crippled another person again!”</p><p>“Who else is blind enough to provoke Lu Ming, this demon? You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>The people in the other courtyards were alarmed and came out to take a look. They gloated at the sight of someone being abused by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked again and LAN Jiu’s body flew out like a ball.</p><p>“Qiuyue, go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the courtyard with Qiu Yue. He made a pot of tea on the table in the courtyard and slowly drank it with Qiu Yue.</p><p>He knew very well that very soon, more people would be coming.</p><p>In the Heavenly King zone, LAN Feng and the heaven’s favorites of the various big families were drinking while waiting.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure flew over from afar. It was LAN Jiu.</p><p>At this moment, LAN Jiu was in an extremely sorry state. His body was in tatters, his hair was disheveled, and his aura was weak.</p><p>“Blue Nine? What’s going on?”</p><p>Seeing LAN Jiu’s state, LAN Feng roared in anger. A cold aura burst out from his body, and killing intent burst out.</p><p>In a mere nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, someone actually dared to hit his servant. He was simply courting death.</p><p>Even the nine Arts Heavenly King had to give him face.</p><p>young master, you must seek justice for me. It’s that Lu Ming. That Lu Ming beat me to this state!</p><p>Blue Nine cried out pitifully.</p><p>“Lu Ming? How dare you!”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted angrily.</p><p>that’s right. That Lu Ming is extremely audacious. I’ve already mentioned young master’s name and the LAN family’s name, but he doesn’t care about them at all. He even said that if young master wants to see him, you have to pay him a visit personally. He’s extremely arrogant!</p><p>Blue Nine cried.</p><p>hehehe, I really didn’t expect that the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor still had such a hothead!</p><p>LAN Feng sneered, his face was extremely cold, and his eyes were as cold as knives.</p><p>A junior from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion actually asked him to personally pay a visit? He was so angry that he laughed.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the Jin clan and the winged people clan smiled and were overjoyed.</p><p>They knew Lu Ming’s temper very well. Therefore, they did not remind LAN Feng of Lu Ming’s abilities in the past. They wanted to intensify the conflict between Lu Ming and LAN Feng.</p><p>brother LAN, this Lu Ming has always been lawless and audacious!</p><p>The Jin clan’s heaven’s favorite said.</p><p>“Hmph, audacious? In front of me, LAN Feng, no matter how bold he is, he has to cower. Didn’t he want me to visit him? then I’ll go!”</p><p>LAN Feng said coldly. He suddenly stood up and stepped in the air.</p><p>As soon as LAN Feng moved, the subordinates he brought with him naturally followed closely.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The paragons of the Jin clan and the winged people clan all had sneers on their faces as they followed LAN Feng to the universal camp.</p><p>When the gate-keeping elder of the universal unit saw LAN Feng, he didn’t dare to stop her and let her in.</p><p>Soon, they arrived outside Lu Ming’s courtyard. A huge aura pressed down on Lu Ming’s courtyard.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>In the courtyard, Lu Ming muttered to himself. He slowly picked up a cup of tea and took a sip.</p><p>“Let’s go and meet them!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, got up, and walked out. Qiu Yue followed closely behind.</p><p>“There are so many people!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and muttered.</p><p>When his gaze swept across the paragons of the Jin clan and the winged people clan, a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>That LAN Feng suddenly looking for him was probably related to the Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>LAN Feng also recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>LAN Feng looked at Lu Ming coldly and asked.</p><p>“That’s right. What can I do for you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You injured my men before?”</p><p>LAN Feng asked.</p><p>“What does it have to do with me if you want to be abused?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
