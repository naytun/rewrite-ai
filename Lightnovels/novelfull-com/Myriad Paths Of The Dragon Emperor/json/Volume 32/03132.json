Some of the geniuses who had yet to reach the divine King realm were torn apart by the destructive energy and died.</p><p>In an instant, Seven heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were killed.</p><p>The other Divine King geniuses were also pushed back and spat out blood. Their bodies were covered in wounds.</p><p>Among the crowd, only one young man was unscathed. He was dressed in a fiery red robe. He slashed out a scorching Saber Light and blocked Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The red-robed young man let out an angry roar, his killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>It was definitely a huge loss to have so many heaven’s favorites killed in one move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The young man in the fiery-red robe slashed at Lu Ming with his saber. A flaming saber radiance was aimed at Lu Ming. The terrifying temperature seemed to be burning the space.</p><p>This young man in the fiery red robe was also a terrifying heaven’s favorite. He was not weaker than Duan Jiang in the slightest, and he was also an existence who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>With a single thought, nine ice chains flew out and intertwined with each other, forming a wall in front of him.</p><p>The flaming saber projection struck the wall of ice chains, causing the ice chains to tremble violently.</p><p>Updated by NovG○.co</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>On the other side, Duan Jiang launched an attack as well. The saber gleams formed into ferocious Tigers that pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Every inch of the Tiger’s body was made up of tiny blade gleams and it was extremely powerful. Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He cast the divine Dragon materialization art and condensed fifteen nine-clawed divine Dragons, which pounced at the Tigers.</p><p>The two sides fought each other.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not stop Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man with the ice chains and the divine Dragon phenomenon alone.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>First of all, the ice chains couldn’t withstand it and kept breaking.</p><p>“Divine flame war blade!”</p><p>The red-robed young man let out a long howl. The power of the scorching saber ray became even more terrifying. It pierced through the ice chains and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward with his spear and exchanged blows with the other party.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a dull explosion in the sky. Lu Ming had blocked the other party’s attack, but his body trembled and he retreated continuously. He felt that his body was enveloped by a ball of sharp flames that could burn him to ashes at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming had to release his divine power continuously to block the ball of flames.</p><p>On the other side, Duan Jiang had also broken through the barrier of the divine Dragon phenomenon and was charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for the two paragons.</p><p>Lu Ming could use all his strength to suppress one of them, but he was no match for two paragons of this level working together.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The red-robed young man and Duan Jiang shouted as they unleashed their ultimate moves and charged toward Lu Ming, completely sealing off his path of retreat.</p><p>“Moon slaying sword, moon slaying sword …”</p><p>From the ” measure ” formula, a steady stream of divine power gushed into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s long spear slashed out continuously, fighting with his opponent.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, both parties had exchanged more than ten moves. However, Lu Ming was still no match for him. His body trembled and he retreated continuously. He was completely suppressed.</p><p>Zi Zi Zi …</p><p>A sizzling sound came from Lu Ming’s body. It was caused by the red-robed young man’s divine flame saber landing on his body. Even the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor could not withstand it and was about to be burned through.</p><p>“Hehe, this kid is dead for sure!”</p><p>Outside the formation, Heavenly King Nine blades chuckled.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had killed seven of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s geniuses in one move, which made the nine blades Heavenly King’s expression turn ugly. Now that he saw Lu Ming in a critical situation, he finally smiled.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts said coldly.</p><p>“Then let’s wait and see!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine blades sneered.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and Duan Jiang had exchanged a few more moves.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thrust his spear forward. A ray of spear light burst out and exploded.</p><p>The supernova could be said to be Lu Ming’s strongest move at the moment. It was shockingly powerful and the terrifying destructive power directly blasted Duan Jiang backward.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he took the opportunity to break away from the encirclement.</p><p>“Don’t go!”</p><p>“Let’s fight to the death if you have the guts!”</p><p>Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man roared.</p><p>“Who said I’m leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air with the long spear in his hand. His aura was violent and he had no intention of retreating.</p><p>Lu Ming still had a trump card that he had not used. It was the battle formula that increased his combat power by fivefold.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had just comprehended the battle character formula and increased his combat power by five times, the success rate of triggering it was extremely low. It was only one in fifty.</p><p>Once it was triggered successfully, Lu Ming’s strength would skyrocket. By then, he would not need to fear Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man.</p><p>As Lu Ming was speaking, he kept triggering the battle formula, hoping that it would be triggered successfully.</p><p>“It’s best if you don’t leave!”</p><p>Duan Jiang shouted. Just as he was about to charge at Lu Ming, his expression suddenly changed. He looked behind Lu Ming, and the red-robed young man did the same.</p><p>Lu Ming also felt something strange behind him. He spread out his spiritual sense and discovered some figures flying rapidly behind him.</p><p>It was obvious that the battle here had alarmed the other heaven’s favorites.</p><p>There were about a dozen of them. They were extremely fast and in a few moments, they appeared a thousand miles behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“People from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>Duan Jiang. The red-robed young man’s face darkened.</p><p>The people who came from behind were the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. In their opinion, the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion would naturally help Lu Ming.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had a helper, it would be difficult to kill him.</p><p>everyone, this man has killed many of our experts. We must avenge him. I hope you won’t interfere!</p><p>Duan Jiang looked at the person behind Lu Ming as he spoke.</p><p>“Not interfere? No, no, no… ”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, a young man shook his head, causing Duan Jiang’s face to turn even gloomier. However, the young man suddenly changed the topic and said, ” “You want to kill Lu Ming, but we want to kill him too. So, let’s join forces!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man were stunned by his words.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s expression did not change. All of this was within his expectations.</p><p>This was because the people who appeared later were Lu Ming’s old acquaintances. These people were divided into two groups. They were the winged people’s families and the Qin family’s prodigies.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed bitterly in his heart. It seemed that his luck was really bad. In front of him were the paragons of the residence of the nine blades Heavenly King, and behind them were the winged people family and the Qin family.</p><p>“This Lu Ming has a blood feud with our families. He must die!”</p><p>A young man from the winged people’s clan added. This person flapped his wings, and wisps of lightning burst forth. His might was astonishing, and he was also a terrifying elite.</p><p>So that’s how it is. Hahaha, just as well. Let’s join forces and grind this person’s bones to dust!”</p><p>Duan Jiang laughed out loud. His saber aura surged, and the saber gleam was astonishing as it slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the red-robed young man made his move. He slashed his divine flame saber at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Behind them, the geniuses of the winged people’s family and the Qin clan all attacked, erupting with terrifying attacks.</p><p>Dozens of attacks were aimed at Lu Ming from all directions. The power was shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
