This trip had not been in vain.</p><p>The thirty-six profound Frost Ice lotus seeds might be able to help him refine a large number of star cores, allowing his cultivation to advance another step.</p><p>However, some people were secretly discussing it.</p><p>that voice just now was so familiar. I seem to have heard it somewhere before!</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. It sounds like Lu Ming!</p><p>it’s indeed him. I can’t have heard wrongly. He’s a celestial deity realm person, so rich and overbearing!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the auction, the eyes of a few young men flickered.</p><p>The auction continued. Lu Ming did not bid much for the rest of the items. Many of the treasures were too expensive and he could not bid even if he wanted to.</p><p>Until the end of the auction, he only made a few moves and bought a few cold-attribute treasures, but the quality was not as good as the profound frost lotus seed.</p><p>The auction ended and the crowd left.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to follow the Wu family. He planned to return to the Wu family first before returning to the space Camp.</p><p>However, when they were walking on the street, they were blocked by a group of people.</p><p>“Jin family, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said with a cold face.</p><p>In front of them was a group of people in golden robes. One look and you could tell that they were from the Jin family.</p><p>“I have something to discuss with Lu Ming!”</p><p>A young man stepped out from the Jin family. He walked with a majestic gait and had an extraordinary temperament.</p><p>“Find me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Brother Jin, you’re really fast!”</p><p>At this moment, a group of people came from another direction.</p><p>The leader of the group was also a young man with an extraordinary temperament.</p><p>This newcomer had wings on his back. He was a member of the winged people’s family.</p><p>“Brother wing!”</p><p>The leading young man from Jin family smiled.</p><p>The people from the Jin family and the winged people family stood in front of the Wu family. This scene attracted the attention of the surrounding people.</p><p>“It’s the people from the Jin clan and the winged people clan. Why are they blocking the people from the Wu clan? Are we going to fight?”</p><p>that’s Lu Ming. He’s in the Wu family. Is he their target? ”</p><p>Many people were secretly discussing.</p><p>“What are you looking for me for? Was he fighting? I’m sorry, I’m not free!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I won’t fight you today, but I’ll make a deal with you!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family smiled and stared at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, you’ve already awakened the origin secret skill. There’s no point in keeping the divine power origin bead. Why don’t you sell it to me? You can name your price!”</p><p>“Sell it to me, the price is negotiable!”</p><p>Then, the young man from the winged man family also spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. He understood that the other party was after the divine power origin bead.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at the youths from the Jin family and the winged man family. He could sense that these two youths had extremely strong auras. Their cultivation levels were most likely above the first level of Godking realm. That was why they had not participated in the fight for the divine power origin bead.</p><p>The day of the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy was getting closer and closer, and everyone was focused on improving their strength.</p><p>The awakening of the origin secret skill would undoubtedly increase their strength. Therefore, they naturally had their eyes on Lu Ming’s divine power Pearl.</p><p>Since Lu Ming had already awakened the origin secret skill, they were certain that Lu Ming’s divine power origin Pearl had not been used up.</p><p>“I’m not selling!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Not selling? Lu Ming, you’ve already awakened the origin secret skill. It’s useless to keep the divine power origin bead. Why don’t you sell it? Only then can its value be fully displayed!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said coldly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The young man from the winged man family also spoke coldly.</p><p>“Even if it’s worthless, why should I sell it? Also, even if I wanted to sell it, why would I sell it to the Jin family? The winged ones ‘family? You guys are so shameless, even more so than the nine blade Heavenly King?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in return, his tone full of sarcasm.</p><p>Back then, when the nine blade Heavenly King wanted to buy the divine power origin bead, Lu Ming did not even want to sell it. It was ridiculous that they wanted to buy it.</p><p>Moreover, the Jin family and the winged ones family had a life-and-death feud with Lu Ming. Why would Lu Ming sell it to them?</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family had an unsightly expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit!”</p><p>The young man from the winged man family’s voice turned cold.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to force a deal? The Heavenly King has said that the divine power source Pearl belongs to me now that I have it. Are you going to disobey his order?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The expressions of the people from the Jin clan and the winged people clan turned unsightly.</p><p>With so many people present, they did not dare to touch Lu Ming. Back then, the nine absolutes Heavenly King had said that whoever dared to snatch Lu Ming’s divine power origin Pearl would be going against him.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, who would dare to go against the nine absolute Heavenly King?</p><p>Lu Ming, if you keep the divine power origin bead and don’t use it, it would be a waste. Why don’t you give it to the other heaven’s favorites of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? this way, on the day of the great void Royal sacred Academy’s inauguration, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s strength will be stronger. They will be able to raise their heads in front of the other Heavenly King mansions and get rid of their last place!</p><p>The young man from Jin family shouted.</p><p>His words made many of the surrounding people think.</p><p>As the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was developed later on, its Foundation was lacking. Among the 27 Heavenly King mansions, it had always been the last.</p><p>The second to last place was the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had always been suppressed by the other Heavenly King manors until they could not raise their heads.</p><p>When the great void Royal sacred Academy was held, it was also a competition between the various Heavenly King manors.</p><p>The more geniuses there were, the stronger they were, and naturally, the more famous they would be. There would also be more experts joining, and the strength of the Heavenly King Palace would naturally become stronger.</p><p>And a divine power Pearl could definitely create a terrifying genius.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had awakened the source secret skill, his cultivation level was too low. No one thought that Lu Ming would do anything on the day of the Grand void Royal sacred Academy’s opening ceremony.</p><p>However, if the divine power origin bead was given to a second-tier God King or even stronger prodigy, a terrifying prodigy would appear. On the day of the great void Royal sacred Academy’s inauguration, The Prodigy would soar to the sky and make the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion proud.</p><p>The young man from the Jin family was trying to push Lu Ming out. Even if they could not get it, they wanted Lu Ming to sell the divine power source Pearl to someone else.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not sell it, it would mean that he was not thinking about the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the reputation of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. This would push Lu Ming to the opposite side of the other families and make the other families not have a good impression of Lu Ming.</p><p>What a vicious scheme.</p><p>However, would Lu Ming care about these?</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly.</p><p>“You … What did you just say?”</p><p>The young man from Jin family was furious.</p><p>“I told you to get lost, did you not hear me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, so you’re saying that you don’t want to sell the divine power origin bead at all? you’re too selfish and don’t care about the Heavenly King residence’s honor. To think that you’re still cultivating in the universal camp. The Heavenly King residence has nurtured you like this, and this is how you repay them?”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family shouted and continued to pin Lu Ming down.</p><p>on the day of the great void Royal sacred Academy’s opening ceremony, I will naturally let the Heavenly King Manor Rise up and not be suppressed by the other Heavenly King manors!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You? Hahaha, you? Who Do You Think You Are? You may be talented, but your cultivation is trash. You’re nothing in front of a true heaven’s favorite!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family laughed mockingly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
