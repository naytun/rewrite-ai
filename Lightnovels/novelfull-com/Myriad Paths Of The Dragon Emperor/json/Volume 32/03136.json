Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the figures stopped attacking and rushed toward the divine power origin bead.</p><p>The leader of the winged clan was the fastest. Like a bolt of lightning, he caught up to the divine power Pearl and grabbed it.</p><p>The leader of the winged people was overjoyed after grabbing the divine power Pearl. With a flap of his wings, he shot forward like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>With his speed, he was confident that he could get rid of the crowd. As long as he could hold on for the last half a day, the divine power Pearl would be his.</p><p>His face was filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Jin Xiang and the others roared. Jin Xiang, the leader of the Qin clan, had originally been on good terms with the winged people’s family, but at this moment, he no longer cared about their previous relationship and charged at the other party with all his might.</p><p>The other paragons, including those from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, also rushed toward the winged man family’s leader.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The leading figure of the winged man family was covered in lightning. He turned into a bolt of lightning, and his speed was faster than the other geniuses. The distance between him and the other geniuses was getting further and further. If this continued, it would be very easy for him to escape and delay them for the last half a day.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites roared in anger.</p><p>The leading figures of the winged people families, including the experts outside the formation, were all ecstatic.</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying saber radiance shot up into the sky.</p><p>This Saber Light was incomparably dazzling, like a bright moon in the sky. With a flash, it charged at the leader of the winged people’s clan with astonishing speed. Its speed was actually not inferior to the leader of the winged people’s clan.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes focused.</p><p>It was a white-robed young man from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. He had an indifferent expression and his eyes were like divine blades.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The white-robed youth said as he slashed down with the saber in his hand. Immediately, a Saber Light burst out. It was tens of thousands of miles long and slashed towards the leader of the winged people’s family. In an instant, the saber Light appeared above the leader’s head and slashed down with terrifying momentum.</p><p>The leader of the winged people’s family’s expression changed drastically, and he roared in anger. He flapped his wings, and countless bolts of lightning turned into a battle sword. It soared into the sky, trying to block the light that was slashing at him.</p><p>However, as the saber radiance fell, the lightning condensed from Thunder collapsed. The saber radiance did not stop and continued to slash down.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The leader of the winged people’s family let out a roar of disbelief. He had never expected that his full-power attack would be completely unable to stop the other party.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the critical moment, he opened his mouth and spat out a defensive divine artifact, which floated above his head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber ray struck the defensive divine artifact, which trembled violently and heavily smashed into the winged man clan’s leader. He cried out in pain, and his body fell to the ground like a meteorite, creating a huge pit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The white-robed young man appeared above the huge pit and looked down coldly.</p><p>The leader of the winged people’s family half-knelt on the ground and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood. He looked at the white-robed young man in the sky with extreme shock.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites also stopped nearby and looked at the white-robed young man in shock.</p><p>This was especially so for the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion like Jin Xiang.</p><p>They knew how terrifying the leader of the winged ones was. He was at the first level of the Godking realm and had awakened the divine power factor. He was definitely invincible among those at the same level. There were very few people at the first level of the Godking realm who could defeat him.</p><p>However, the white-robed young man was able to injure his opponent with one move. What kind of strength was this?</p><p>“How can he be this strong? Could it be that his cultivation base isn’t at the first level of the Godking realm?”</p><p>Someone mumbled. They thought that the white-robed youth’s cultivation wasn’t at the first level of the Godking realm, but higher.</p><p>no, his cultivation is still at the first level of Godking realm!</p><p>“He’s even at the first level of the Godking realm. How can he be this strong?”</p><p>“The origin divine power factor. It’s because of the origin divine power factor. This person has awakened the origin divine power factor twice!”</p><p>“What? The second awakening of Shen power!”</p><p>All the elites present gasped.</p><p>Every time divine power was awakened, it would become more and more difficult. The next awakening would be at least ten times harder than the previous one.</p><p>The first awakening was already difficult enough, and the second awakening was even more difficult.</p><p>The other party was only at the first level of the divine King realm, but his divine power had actually awakened for the second time. This was truly too terrifying.</p><p>This kind of difficulty was simply several times more difficult than the first awakening at the half-step Divine King level.</p><p>No wonder, no wonder the white-robed youth’s strength was so terrifying.</p><p>The second awakening of Shen power was much more powerful than the first.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, a second-Awakener with divine power could easily kill a first-Awakener.</p><p>Outside the formation, all the experts were shocked.</p><p>“It’s actually the second awakening!”</p><p>a first level Divine King, and his divine power can actually be awakened for the second time. This is too terrifying, what a monster!</p><p>Many big shots sighed.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s face was extremely gloomy. He looked at Heavenly King Nine sabers and said, ” so, this is the reason for your confidence. There’s actually such a heaven’s favorite in your nine blades Heavenly King mansion. No one can compete with him at all!</p><p>“Hahaha, thanks for the compliment!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine sabers laughed heartily.</p><p>This time, his plan could be said to have succeeded perfectly.</p><p>The divine power origin bead was such a precious treasure. He had no intention of giving it to the Paragon of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>He had planned to give the divine power source Pearl to the white-robed youth. He could kill two birds with one stone by holding this event.</p><p>On one hand, he could destroy the relationship between the various aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor and stir up conflicts between them.</p><p>Secondly, the divine power origin bead would eventually return to the white-robed young man, which meant that he would be rewarded to the white-robed young man in various ways. The other paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion would have nothing to say and would be convinced.</p><p>At the thought of this, nine blades Heavenly King felt even more comfortable and his thoughts were clear.</p><p>On the other hand, Heavenly King Nine cuts was the complete opposite. His face was extremely gloomy. He knew that he had been completely toyed with by the nine blades Heavenly King.</p><p>Within the formation, the white-robed young man stood high in the sky and looked down at the leading figure of the winged people’s family. His indifferent voice rang out, ” “Hand over the divine power origin bead, or die!”</p><p>His tone was overbearing and unquestionable.</p><p>The leader of the winged people family had an extremely ugly expression. If he didn’t hand it over, he would definitely die.</p><p>wait a minute. The divine power origin bead is in the hands of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Let’s delay for half a day and discuss the distribution. We can’t let the nine blades Heavenly King mansion get it!</p><p>At that moment, a voice was heard. It was the woo family’s leader.</p><p>that’s right. No matter what, the divine power origin bead must fall into the hands of my nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Then, Zhao Mo also spoke.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Following that, the other heaven’s favorites also spoke up.</p><p>The leaders of the families stepped into the air and slowly approached the white-robed young man.</p><p>Although the white-robed young man had awakened his divine power for the second time and was very powerful, with so many of them who had awakened their divine power for the first time working together, it was enough to defeat him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
