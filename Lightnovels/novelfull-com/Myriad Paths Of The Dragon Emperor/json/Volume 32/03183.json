One could imagine how powerful Qiu Yue was.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu Yue followed up and stepped on Guan gulang’s mouth.</p><p>Guan gulang screamed miserably. His mouth was crushed, and blood was spurting out of his mouth. His teeth also flew out.</p><p>Guan gulang’s face was completely deformed.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see if you still dare to scold young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue snorted coldly, then moved back to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in admiration.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, do you only know how to hide behind women? If it wasn’t for this woman, I could crush you with one finger. Ah ah …”</p><p>Guan gulang struggled to get up and screamed madly. However, because his teeth had been knocked out, they had not grown out for a while. When he spoke, his mouth was full of air.</p><p>“Oh, really? You want to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer. Just as he was about to take a step forward, he suddenly felt a few icy-cold killing intents land on him.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and looked in the direction of the killing intent.</p><p>There were a few young men wrapped in black robes. Their faces were ghastly and pale as they stared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>it’s him! He’s from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of the black-robed young men.</p><p>Back then, in star-moon ancient city, Lu Ming had encountered three geniuses from the abysmal Heavenly King residence. Two of them had been killed by Lu Ming, and only one had survived.</p><p>The young man before him was the one he had encountered in star-moon ancient city.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>If the other party did not know what was good for him, he did not mind sending him on his way.</p><p>alright, we’ve gathered enough people. We can set off now!</p><p>At this moment, a group of people walked over and spoke loudly, their voices spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>This group of people were naturally from the bone sword clan.</p><p>“Is this the bone sword race?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>The bone sword clan’s people had very strange appearances. They looked similar to humans, but they were all as thin as sticks, looking like skeletons.</p><p>And behind them, a sword hilt was revealed.</p><p>That’s right, it was the hilt of a sword that came out of their backbones.</p><p>It was said that the spine of the bone sword clan was born with a bone sword, which was extremely powerful and terrifying.</p><p>The higher the cultivation, the stronger the bone sword would be.</p><p>This time, the ‘sword bones’ they had collected from the secret realm were of great help to the bone sword clan’s cultivation. Otherwise, the bone sword clan would not have offered such attractive conditions to ask for help.</p><p>When the bone sword clan appeared, the youth from the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace withdrew his killing intent.</p><p>Everyone else’s attention was also drawn to the bone sword clan.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Guan gulang coldly snorted. His eyes were constantly flashing with killing intent. He was planning a ruthless plan in his heart.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, don’t let me find an opportunity. Otherwise, I’ll see how you die!”</p><p>Guan gulang gritted his teeth.</p><p>everyone, I believe that you all understand the specific situation. This time, we are entering a secret realm. There are many wild beasts living inside. On the spine of these wild beasts, there is a kind of sword bone. Your goal is that kind of sword bone!</p><p>the sword bones are divided into three colors-black, silver, and gold. The quality is different with different colors!</p><p>black is the worst, and gold is the best. Moreover, the sword bones are calculated by weight. One Jin of gold sword bones is equivalent to ten Jin of silver sword bones, which is equivalent to one hundred Jin of black sword bones!</p><p>if I can obtain 500 kilograms of black sword bone, I can cultivate under the saintly heaven Jade wall for a day. 500 kilograms of black sword bone is two days, and so on!</p><p>The bone sword clan member explained.</p><p>Everyone nodded. They already knew this.</p><p>I’ll say it again. The desolate beasts in the secret realm are very dangerous and powerful. If you die in battle, my bone sword clan will not be responsible. If you want to leave now, you can leave!</p><p>The bone sword clan expert continued.</p><p>Of course, no one backed out.</p><p>When they came, they already knew that it was dangerous to kill desolate beasts to obtain sword bones. They had already prepared themselves mentally.</p><p>alright, since no one wants to withdraw, then sign your names on the life and death contract and you can enter the Mystic realm!</p><p>The bone sword clan’s member said, before taking out a huge life and death contract.</p><p>Every time, there would be many geniuses who came, and many of them had great backgrounds.</p><p>Clearly, the bone sword clan was afraid that if these heaven’s pride experts died, the power behind them would cause trouble for the bone sword clan.</p><p>Once the life and death agreement was signed, it would mean that they were willing, and those forces would have nothing to say.</p><p>Everyone lined up and signed the life and death agreement. Then, they left under the lead of the bone sword clan expert.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a wide platform. In front of the platform, there was a mirror floating in the air.</p><p>There was a stone bridge that extended from the platform to the mirror.</p><p>“Is that secret realm inside the mirror?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Sure enough, the bone sword clan member spoke up, ” that secret realm is inside this mirror. This mirror is an ancient treasure passed down by my bone sword clan. The mirror is a world of its own, but my bone sword clan can’t enter it. You can go in. The time limit is one year, and you can come out at any time!</p><p>With that, some elders and middle-aged men stepped forward along the stone bridge towards the mirror.</p><p>Every once in a while, the bone sword clan would open the mirror world and invite people to hunt for the sword bones inside. This was not the first time for some of them, so they were very familiar with the place.</p><p>The closer these people got to the mirror, the smaller their bodies became. When they got close to the mirror, their bodies became the size of dust, and then they disappeared into the mirror.</p><p>The others followed him and walked toward the mirror.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he walked toward the mirror along the stone bridge with Qiuyue Lanling.</p><p>It was strange. The more they walked towards the mirror, the bigger the mirror became. In the end, the mirror seemed to cover the sky.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>As soon as their bodies came into contact with the mirror, it was as if they had passed through a layer of water. The next moment, Lu Ming and the rest appeared on a flight of stairs.</p><p>Behind them, there was also a mirror.</p><p>They had already entered the world inside the mirror.</p><p>Looking up, there was a vast world in front of him. He could not see the end.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the distance, a roar could be heard.</p><p>“It’s the swordbone beast!”</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Many people rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Those who had come here through the mirror all rose into the air and flew in different directions to hunt the swordbone beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming saw Guan gulang casting a cold glance at him and flying away with his companions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
