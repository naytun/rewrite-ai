They were the three young men from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The black-robed young man in the middle glared at Lu Ming like a venomous snake with his long and narrow eyes. He did not hide his killing intent at all.</p><p>“What are you guys trying to do?”</p><p>LAN Ling said coldly.</p><p>She did not know about The Grudge between Lu Ming and the residence of the nine serenity Heavenly King.</p><p>“What are you doing? Naturally, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>The black-robed young man’s voice was icy cold. As soon as he finished speaking, a shocking aura emanated from his body and enveloped Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling.</p><p>“Third level of King God Realm!”</p><p>LAN Ling cried out in shock and her face turned pale.</p><p>This youth was at the third level of the king God Realm and was a genius who had awakened the divine power source.</p><p>However, this was not out of Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>The other party had seen Qiu Yue’s attack and crushed Guan gulang and the others. Yet, she still dared to block in front of them with such confidence to kill them. She must have enough confidence.</p><p>The other two heaven’s favorites from the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace were much weaker.</p><p>The young man he had met in star-moon ancient city had already reached the first level of the divine King realm.</p><p>The other one was at the second level of the divine King realm, which was similar to Guan gulang. They were both existences who had awakened the origin divine power factor. He believed that even in the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace, he would be the top heaven’s pride.</p><p>“Young master, leave it to me!”</p><p>let’s go! Qiu Yue said and stepped forward. A powerful aura burst out of her body. It was extremely sharp and broke through the suppression of the other party’s aura.</p><p>Her eyes revealed an expression of eagerness.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This girl was addicted to beating him up.</p><p>Since Qiu Yue had obtained the inheritance of the divine eye heavenly Lord, she had been cultivating and had not had a good battle. After beating up Guan gulang, she was very excited to fight.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said.</p><p>“You left her alone?”</p><p>LAN Ling was shocked.</p><p>“Of course. If we have to work together to deal with a few cats and dogs, how terrible would that be?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips, his face full of disdain.</p><p>His words almost angered the three youths from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion to death.</p><p>“The three of you will die together!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite in the middle roared and waved his hand. A few ghostly claws formed and grabbed at Qiu Yue, Lu Ming, and LAN Ling.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted and waved her hand. Three blade lights slashed out and cut the three ghost claws in half.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and moved like lightning. With a wave of his hand, Saber Light swept across and enveloped the three youths from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Kill this b * tch!”</p><p>The strongest heaven’s favorite from the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion roared. His body kept flashing, and he actually dodged Qiu Yue’s Saber Light and rushed toward her.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue’s face was calm and her body was shrouded in divine power. She was like a peerless goddess.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, rays of saber radiance shot out from the ground and enveloped the other party, leaving him no room to retreat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor trembled and retreated.</p><p>As for the other two heaven’s favorites from the abysmal Heavenly King mansion, they had to use all their strength to avoid Qiu Yue’s attack.</p><p>“You’re looking for death! Ghostmist kill!”</p><p>The leading heaven’s favorite from the nine Serenities Heavenly King residence shouted. His body actually exploded with a bang and turned into a ghostly mist.</p><p>At the same time, the other two geniuses of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor did the same. Their bodies exploded and turned into ghostly mist.</p><p>The three ghostly fogs expanded rapidly and soon covered the land within a thousand miles. Qiu Yue was also instantly covered in the ghostly fog.</p><p>“Let’s retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the Indigo spirit and retreated quickly, leaving the area covered by the ghosts.</p><p>“You’re so assured of her!”</p><p>LAN Ling said.</p><p>She had seen Qiu Yue fight before and suppressed Guan gulang. She was envious and jealous of Qiu Yue’s strength.</p><p>However, the young man leading the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion was at the third level of the divine King realm. He had awakened the origin divine power factor and was one level higher than Guan gulang. He would probably be able to suppress Guan gulang with one move.</p><p>Qiu Yue was his opponent?</p><p>“What’s there to be worried about?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>It was true that it was difficult for top geniuses at the divine King realm to fight above their cultivation level.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue could.</p><p>Qiu Yue had cultivated the universe thousand Dao Arts, mastered the God-destroying light, and even awakened the origin secret skill. With all these skills combined, even if the opponent was a top genius, he would have no problem fighting against someone of a higher level.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the ghostly mist, there were constant rumbles, and from time to time, one could see divine light bursting out. The battle was very intense.</p><p>Lu Ming and LAN Ling stood in the distance and watched from afar.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming turned his head and looked behind him. He said indifferently, ” “What are you hiding there for? Come out!”</p><p>LAN Ling was shocked and quickly looked back.</p><p>“Hahaha, you have sharp senses!”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard, and then four young men flew over.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a strange smile. There was no other reason. These four young men were really Guan gulang and the other three.</p><p>In fact, before the battle between Qiu Yue and the people from the abysmal Heavenly King mansion, Guan gulang and the other three had already arrived not far away. They hid in the dark and watched from a distance. When Qiu Yue and the people from the abysmal Heavenly King mansion started fighting, Guan gulang was excited and was discovered by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect that you’ve offended so many people despite your low cultivation level. You’ve even offended the people from the residence of the nine serenity Heavenly King. Now that the woman is trapped by them, let’s see who can help you.”</p><p>Guan gulang laughed without restraint.</p><p>He was only afraid of Qiu Yue. Now that Qiu Yue was being blocked by the others, it would be a piece of cake for him to kill Lu Ming, a half-step Divine King.</p><p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh …</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard from afar.</p><p>More people had arrived. There were more than ten figures who appeared not far away. Some were young and some were old. However, they didn’t get close. Instead, they stood not far away and watched.</p><p>It was obvious that they were attracted by the battle between Qiu Yue and the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“What a pity …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed slightly at the sight of so many people.</p><p>He had originally wanted to kill Guan gulang and the others here.</p><p>But now that so many people had come, he could not kill Guan gulang.</p><p>After all, it was his first time in the great illusionary Holy capital and he did not have any Foundation.</p><p>As for the blue merchant, it was no longer the blue merchant of the past. It no longer had much influence.</p><p>As for the guangu family, they were, after all, a big family in the great void Holy capital. They were much stronger than the Jin family and the Qin family of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>If he killed Guan gulang, Guan Gujian would go crazy and kill him. No one could help him.</p><p>Only when he entered the great void Royal sacred Academy, or even the top ten, and obtained the qualification to open a house and establish a clan, would he be able to gain a firm foothold. At that time, he would not have any scruples in killing Guan gulang.</p><p>But now, he had no choice but to be apprehensive.</p><p>“I can only give him a good beating!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>brat, no matter how much you talk to yourself, it’s useless. I will destroy your star core and let you be like that cripple LAN Shang, struggling at death’s door!</p><p>Guan gulang shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
