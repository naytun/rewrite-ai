He wasn’t someone they could deal with.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, the bone demon let out a loud roar. The Dragon roars burst out, and a terrifying fluctuation burst out from the mouth of the bone demon, forming a circle of shock waves that rushed in all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The black-robed men were hit by the shock wave and exploded. They died on the spot without a corpse.</p><p>The dozens of black-robed men were all dead.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Wu Shan and Han Ying were dumbfounded.</p><p>Dozens of powerful black-robed men were annihilated after the bone Devil’s roar.</p><p>They finally knew that ever since the bone demon came, Lu Ming had become so relaxed and calm. The bone demon’s abilities were too powerful and unfathomable.</p><p>this person’s strength is not below the family head’s!</p><p>Wu Shan thought to himself and was shocked.</p><p>Such an expert would be an Overlord even in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He did not expect that Lu Ming would have such an expert by his side.</p><p>“There are still a few more, I’ll be back soon!”</p><p>Bone said, and then disappeared.</p><p>Not all of the black-robed men who had entered the asteroid field had come. Some of the black-robed men who were further away had not made it in time.</p><p>The bone Devil was going to exterminate them all.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long before the bone Devil returned.</p><p>“It’s been settled. Where are you going now?”</p><p>Bone asked.</p><p>go to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and expose the sikong family!</p><p>Lu Ming said, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>It was obvious that the sikong family was the one who had sent people to assassinate Lu Ming. Lu Ming would not be at ease until he completely destroyed the sikong family.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bone waved his hand, and a divine force enveloped Lu Ming and the others. He swept them up and flew away.</p><p>The bone Devil was too fast. He crossed the starry sky, and stars kept flying past them.</p><p>There were two inter-Starfield teleportation formations in the chutian star field. They flew towards one of them.</p><p>In just half a day’s time, they were close to one of the inter-star field teleportation arrays. Their speed was many times faster than when Lu Ming and the rest were flying.</p><p>This inter-star field teleportation formation was located on a huge meteorite. Near this meteorite was a huge business planet.</p><p>The few of them flew towards the teleportation array.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At this time, bone’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Before Lu Ming and the rest could react, the meteorite with the inter-star field teleportation array exploded with an earth-shattering aura. A powerful pressure locked onto them.</p><p>you’re finally here. I didn’t expect that a peak Divine King would interfere. No wonder those trash couldn’t take you down!</p><p>A cold voice came from the meteorite.</p><p>As soon as the voice was heard, a black-robed elder appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>This old man’s entire body was suffused with black light, covering the sky and earth. It was extremely terrifying, like an abyss that could devour everything.</p><p>“This cultivation level … The peak of God King!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped and looked horrified.</p><p>The old man’s aura gave him the feeling that he wasn’t any weaker than the head of the Jin family. He was a master.</p><p>He didn’t expect that there would be a peak Divine King expert in this teleportation array. The sikong family had really invested a lot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, bone demon also released an aura, which dispersed the old man’s aura.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The old man was very direct. He directly used his killing move. He waved his palm, and a shocking blade light burst out, slashing towards bone demon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Bone demon let out a roar, and his body grew rapidly, turning into the body of a Dark Dragon. He reached out a Dragon Claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon Claw collided with the saber radiance. The entire void space shook violently as if it was going to collapse.</p><p>Fortunately, they were fighting in the universe. Otherwise, it would have been a world-ending battle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blade-light shook violently and then shattered, while bone demon’s body twisted and retreated tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>“You’re too confident if you think you can kill us with your strength!”</p><p>Bone demon roared and reached out his dragon claws to grab the old man.</p><p>“Slash! Slash, slash, slash!”</p><p>A saber appeared in the old man’s hand. He slashed out several times, and a terrifying Saber Light soared up into the sky, slashing toward bone demon.</p><p>Bone demon and the old man were fighting each other, and the battle stirred up endless energy.</p><p>However, the bone demon kept Lu Ming and the others behind it. Otherwise, they would not have been able to withstand the force.</p><p>heavens, that’s terrifying. What kind of existences are fighting? ”</p><p>Near the inter-star field teleport formation, many people were shocked by the battle. They looked over in fear.</p><p>They had never seen such a great battle before. There was no such powerful existence in chutian star field.</p><p>it’s too terrifying, too terrifying. This is the end of the world!</p><p>let’s go. We’ll be in trouble if we get affected!</p><p>Near the inter-star field teleportation array, many people flew away, afraid of being affected.</p><p>Bone demon and black shirt exchanged dozens of blows before bone demon finally gained the upper hand.</p><p>Bone demon’s body was dark Dragon, an existence that had surpassed the God King realm. His body was indestructible, and his defense was amazing.</p><p>The bone demon could ignore its defense in a fight, so it was naturally more powerful.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, this person is stalling for time. He might have a helper!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bone demon.</p><p>“I don’t want to fight with you anymore!”</p><p>The bone demon repelled the old man in Black with one move. It led Lu Ming and the rest to the inter-star field teleportation array.</p><p>“You still want to leave when you’re in my hands? Stay here!”</p><p>The elder in black said coldly. He changed the direction of his saber and slashed at Lu Ming and the rest instead of the bone Devil.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group’s expressions changed. The other party’s saber was very far away from them, but they could feel a terrifying saber intent pressing on their bodies. Their bodies seemed to be about to explode.</p><p>Fortunately, the bone demon had acted in time and swung its Dragon Tail to destroy the other party’s saber aura. Otherwise, Lu Ming and the rest would have been killed in an instant.</p><p>In the face of such a peak Divine King, be it Lu Ming or QiuQiu, they were completely powerless to resist.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After the black-robed elder’s attack was blocked, he changed his saber stance again and attacked Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The bone demon could only defend itself. In that case, it would have to take care of Lu Ming and the rest. How could it rush over? it was entangled by the elder in black.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
