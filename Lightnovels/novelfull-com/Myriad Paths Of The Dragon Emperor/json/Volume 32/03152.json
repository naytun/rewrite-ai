Furthermore, it was a young man.</p><p>However, he was a schemer, and the killing intent in his heart was strong, but the expression on his face did not change.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you, an eighth level heavenly deity, could actually defeat a Divine King subordinate of mine. It’s truly a rare sight!”</p><p>LAN Feng smiled faintly. His cultivation level was very high. In addition, Lu Ming did not deliberately hide his cultivation level. He could naturally tell Lu Ming’s realm.</p><p>After saying that, LAN Feng glanced at LAN Jiu coldly.</p><p>LAN Jiu was actually defeated by an eighth level celestial deity. This made him very unhappy.</p><p>LAN Jiu shivered, his face pale and his heart cold.</p><p>“It’s just average. It’s your subordinates who are useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming played it down.</p><p>“I heard that you have a divine power Pearl, is that true?”</p><p>LAN Feng’s tone suddenly changed.</p><p>“So you’ve come for the divine power origin bead. Hmph, so it really is the Jin family and the winged people family. Do you want to kill with a borrowed knife?”</p><p>Lu Ming could guess what had happened.</p><p>It must have been the Jin family and the winged people family who told LAN Feng. Otherwise, how would LAN Feng know that he had a divine power Pearl?</p><p>“So what if I am?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“There really is!”</p><p>LAN Feng’s eyes were incomparably bright, flashing with a blazing radiance.</p><p>He had yet to awaken his origin secret skill. If he had the divine power source Pearl, he would definitely be able to awaken his origin secret skill. With his original strength and his origin secret skill, he was confident that he would be able to enter the top ten on the day of the great void Royal sacred Academy’s opening ceremony and obtain the right to establish his own clan.</p><p>He had to get the divine power origin bead.</p><p>good, very good. Name your price. I’ll buy the divine power source Pearl!</p><p>LAN Feng said.</p><p>“I’m not selling!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected her very decisively.</p><p>I’m not selling it. You’d better consider it carefully. We can discuss the price. Also, if you sell the divine power Pearl to me, I’ll write off the fact that you injured my subordinate!</p><p>LAN Feng said indifferently, but even a fool could hear the threat in his tone.</p><p>“I’m not selling. Don’t you understand? Also, I’m going to cultivate, so don’t disturb me!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands.</p><p>how dare you, kid! Who Do You Think You Are? the young master is giving you face by buying your things. Don’t be ungrateful!</p><p>One of LAN Feng’s subordinates stepped out and shouted. His violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He was also a young man, but his aura was violent and filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>This was a prodigy who had awakened the origin source of divine power and was at the first level of the Godking realm.</p><p>The paragons of the Jin clan and the winged people clan all had shocked expressions in their eyes.</p><p>A subordinate of LAN Feng was actually this talented. The great families of the great illusionary divine capital indeed had a deep and unfathomable Foundation.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Since you don’t want the face I’ve given you, then I can only beat you down and take it myself!”</p><p>LAN Feng’s subordinate said coldly.</p><p>Lan Liu, make your move. Break his leg and take his storage ring!</p><p>LAN Feng ordered.</p><p>He finally lost his patience. He could not be bothered to talk nonsense with Lu Ming and wanted to take action directly.</p><p>“Young master, don’t worry!”</p><p>Blue Six acknowledged the order and walked toward Lu Ming, revealing a ferocious smile.</p><p>The geniuses of the Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family looked at each other, but they still did not warn LAN Feng.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely terrifying. If even Yuan Yu was not his match, Lan Liu would definitely not be his match either.</p><p>However, they deliberately did not remind them and let LAN Feng’s people fight with Lu Ming. In this case, Lu Ming would offend LAN Feng.</p><p>Lu Ming would be doomed if he offended LAN Feng.</p><p>“Young master, let me do it!”</p><p>At the side, Qiu Yue spoke and was about to make a move.</p><p>“How can I let you deal with a few cats and dogs? Qiuyue, watch from the side!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a step forward, his eighth level celestial deity aura bloomed.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lan Liu shouted coldly. Lu Ming actually said that he was a nobody. He was simply courting death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lan Liu’s aura bloomed completely, and it was extremely shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, a blue sword light burst out from Lan Liu’s hand and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fists and nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky. There were twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons in total and they pounced toward Lan Liu.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s figure rapidly grew in size and turned into a green-armored ancient God. His spear was like a mountain as it pressed down on Lan Liu.</p><p>ancient God Body! Green-armored ancient God Body! This kid …</p><p>&Nbsp; seeing Lu Ming use his green-armored ancient God Body, LAN Feng’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>It was one thing for him to have cultivated an ancient God Body, but he had also cultivated a green-armored ancient God. This was extremely rare even in the great void Holy capital.</p><p>no wonder he was able to defeat LAN Jiu with his eighth-level celestial deity cultivation!</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming had transformed into a green-armored ancient God to defeat LAN Jiu. He had not expected that Lu Ming had defeated LAN Jiu without transforming into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>The Blue Sword gleam slashed at the nine-clawed Divine Dragon and a series of loud bangs erupted.</p><p>Lan Liu was very powerful. He was at the first tier of the divine King realm and had awakened the origin divine power factor. His combat strength was extremely powerful, and the nine-clawed divine Dragons were defeated one after another.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s long spear came pressing down, he finally could not withstand it. The sword gleam exploded and he retreated frantically.</p><p>“Sword Dao as one!”</p><p>Seeing that he had been pushed back by Lu Ming, Lan Liu roared in anger. His sword flashed and he cast a terrifying secret skill.</p><p>Countless sword shadows burst out, as if they were going to split the sky, and they slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and waved his long spear. A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed out horizontally.</p><p>Wherever the spear radiance passed, Lan Liu’s sword radiance shattered one after another. His figure retreated explosively and he coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>To be honest, Lan Liu’s combat strength was very strong. He might even be a little stronger than Jin Xiang.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming was at the seventh-level celestial deity realm, he could suppress Jin Xiang without using the door of domination. Now that he had broken through to the eighth-level celestial deity realm, it would not be too difficult for him to defeat Lan Liu.</p><p>this kid has such strong combat strength. How can he be so strong? ”</p><p>At this moment, LAN Feng was also extremely shocked.</p><p>He came from the great illusionary Holy capital and had seen many outstanding and perverted people. However, he had never seen anyone as strong as Lu Ming.</p><p>this kid must have a secret. I must get it!</p><p>The greed in LAN Feng’s eyes intensified.</p><p>“Ah, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Lan Liu was forced back again and was even injured. He was completely enraged and let out a roar. Then, his body swelled up rapidly and turned into a giant ancient God.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He did not expect Lan Liu to have cultivated an ancient God Body.</p><p>However, Lan Liu’s ancient God Body was only that of a yellow-armored ancient God. His entire body was golden like a golden sculpture.</p><p>It was two levels lower than Lu Ming’s Green-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>However, Lan Liu’s yellow-armored ancient God had also increased his strength by a large margin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Its huge body stepped in the air, holding a giant sword in its hand, and charged at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
