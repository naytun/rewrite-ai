He’ll be here soon, but we have to avoid the pursuit of those black-robed men of sacrifice before he arrives!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Shan and Han Ying nodded as they looked forward.</p><p>Countless meteorites were floating in the space in front of them.</p><p>Countless meteorites of different sizes were floating in the universe. It was a vast and boundless region.</p><p>In the distant past, this must have been a tragic battlefield. Many planets were destroyed, forming countless meteorites that floated in the universe.</p><p>Their target was this area.</p><p>This area was extremely complex, with countless meteorites in a chaotic mess. They were going to use this terrain to avoid the enemy’s pursuit and hold on until the bone demon arrived.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>.com</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. The three of them flew forward and into the group of meteorites.</p><p>Soon, they disappeared into the meteorites.</p><p>……</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest were escaping, sikong family of nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>In a hidden Hall, a black-robed man was reporting to a middle-aged man.</p><p>This middle-aged man was the current master of the sikong family, sikong Nan.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sikong Nan smacked the chair handle, his body emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>what a bunch of trash. You can’t even wipe out a small force like chutian star field. Why should I keep you? ”</p><p>Sikong Nan’s cold voice sounded out, making that black-robed person’s entire body tremble.</p><p>“Master, according to a reliable source, the young lady of the Han family was saved by Lu Ming!”</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming again. That little b * stard. He keeps ruining my plans. He’s really courting death!</p><p>“Go, send out more experts. We must kill them. Our information absolutely can not be leaked out!” Sikong Nan shouted coldly.</p><p>“Yes, this subordinate will do it now. We will definitely send our strongest experts!“</p><p>The black-robed man nodded repeatedly, then turned around and left.</p><p>no, I’m still worried. I have to make sure that everything goes well. I’ll go there myself!</p><p>Sikong Nan muttered. Then, his figure flashed and he left.</p><p>……</p><p>Chu Tian Star Domain!</p><p>More than an hour after Lu Ming and the other two entered the group of meteorites, many figures appeared outside the group of meteorites.</p><p>All of them were black-robed men. There were dozens of them and they were all experts. Even the weakest among them was at the divine King realm.</p><p>the target is in this group of meteorites!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said.</p><p>“Hmph, are they trying to use this asteroid field to play hide-and-seek with us? What a joke. Let’s split up and go in to search for them. Let’s see where they can hide. Once we have news, immediately inform the others!”</p><p>A powerful black-robed man said.</p><p>Immediately, dozens of black-robed men scattered into groups of three to five and flew into the meteorites.</p><p>After Lu Ming, Wu Shan, and Han Ying flew into the meteorites, they did not stop at one spot. After stopping on one meteorites for a while, they immediately moved to another meteorites to disrupt the other party’s search.</p><p>Just like that, they went around in circles among the meteorites for three days.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming shouted coldly in one direction.</p><p>“Kid, your spiritual sense is quite sharp.”</p><p>A chuckling voice was heard. Then, a burly Man in Black appeared in front of them.</p><p>Seeing the Man in Black, Wu Shan and Han Ying’s expressions changed. They tensed up and got ready for battle.</p><p>However, Lu Ming smiled and said, ” “Senior bone demon, you’ve finally come!”</p><p>The speed of the bone demon was truly astonishing. It had only been three days, and it had already arrived here from the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, Wu Shan and Han Ying heaved a long sigh of relief. They knew that the ‘senior’ that Lu Ming mentioned had arrived!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys are in such a sorry state!”</p><p>Bone said with a smile.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, please don’t mock me. By the way, did you see any black-robed men when you came in?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, there are dozens of people, many of whom are experts. They are looking for you all!”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Very good. Now, let’s capture them all in one fell swoop!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with killing intent.</p><p>After being chased for so long, he had a stomach full of pent-up anger, and now it was time to fight back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>Bone laughed.</p><p>“Of course it’s to lure them into the trap!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Then, they stopped running and instead rushed back in the direction they had come from.</p><p>Not long after …</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, five to six black-robed men surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kid, let’s see how you’re going to escape!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men spoke ferociously, his killing intent as cold as a blade.</p><p>They glanced at bone demon, but he had concealed his aura. With their cultivation, they couldn’t see through his strength, so they didn’t put him in their eyes.</p><p>“Escape? why should I escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Not escaping? You know you can’t escape!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men sneered.</p><p>The black-robed men were not in a hurry to attack. They were still a little apprehensive about Lu Ming and the others. They were still short of manpower. If Lu Ming and the others went all out, they would most likely suffer losses.</p><p>Now that they had the upper hand and they had already sent a voice transmission to the others, they would be here soon. By then, it would be easy for them to deal with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Since the black-robed man did not make a move, Lu Ming and the rest naturally did not make a move either.</p><p>Lu Ming was also waiting. He was waiting for the black-robed men to gather together and capture them all in one fell swoop.</p><p>Wu Shan and Han Ying were worried.</p><p>After all, they did not know the strength of the bone demon. However, seeing Lu Ming’s calm expression, they could only brace themselves and wait.</p><p>The few black-robed men felt a little strange. Why did Lu Ming and the rest not break out of the encirclement?</p><p>If they didn’t break out now, wouldn’t they have even less of a chance when they had more people?</p><p>“Hmph, I don’t care what tricks you’re playing. In the face of absolute power, it’s still a dead end!”</p><p>Some of the black-robed men thought to themselves.</p><p>As expected, not long after, black-robed figures flickered and gathered from all directions.</p><p>Dozens of black-robed men surrounded Lu Ming and the rest in the middle.</p><p>“Why aren’t you doing anything? kill them!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men behind him said coldly and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was terrifyingly strong and his aura was violent. Lu Ming felt that his body was locked and he could not move.</p><p>The black-robed man’s cultivation was definitely at the fifth level of Godking realm or higher.</p><p>It was a good thing that they had not met this person before. Otherwise, they would definitely not be able to escape.</p><p>But now …</p><p>The bone demon stepped forward and came before Lu Ming. Then, it stretched out a palm and made a grabbing motion.</p><p>Suddenly, a huge Dragon Claw appeared in the air and grabbed at the black-robed man. The knife light shattered like paper. The Dragon Claw didn’t stop and grabbed the black-robed man.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed man shouted in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
