It was a scene of doomsday.</p><p>In the ruins, there were corpses everywhere.</p><p>The vast land was filled with corpses, and the smell of blood permeated the air.</p><p>The wind moon sect had been exterminated.</p><p>“Damn it, we’re one step too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>.com</p><p>It was obvious that the mastermind wanted to exterminate the entire family and erase the evidence.</p><p>He had annihilated the wind moon sect one step ahead of them.</p><p>“Let’s go and see if there are any survivors!”</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed his anger and rushed forward.</p><p>However, there were corpses everywhere, and not a single living thing was left.</p><p>“What a ruthless method, what a ruthless method!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled.</p><p>Lu Ming was considered a person who had seen many big scenes. However, he had rarely seen such ruthless means.</p><p>How many people did the wind moon sect, a major power that dominated chutian star field, have? It was hard to tell, but they were all dead now. Not a single one was left.</p><p>it seems that these people were killed not long ago. Otherwise, the news would have spread long ago!</p><p>Wu Shan said with a frown.</p><p>not good! Let’s go to the Han family. Hurry!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>The other party had annihilated the wind moon sect, so they would definitely not let the Han family off.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Wu Shan’s face also changed. Immediately, the two of them rushed to the Han family.</p><p>The Han family’s headquarters was also on a vast planet. On this planet, there was a mountain range with the densest divine Qi, and most of the Han family lived here.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming and Wu Shan arrived, they discovered that the mountain range had also collapsed. The palace had been destroyed, and there were corpses all over the rubble. The smell of blood assailed their nostrils, making it look like hell on earth.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily. They were late again. The other party was really ruthless.</p><p>The two of them were unwilling to give up and began to search through the ruins to see if they could find any survivors.</p><p>Unfortunately, all of them were corpses. Even the dire beasts had been killed. There were no survivors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was extremely gloomy. He had finally found a clue. Was it broken again?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of something breaking through the air was heard. A few black-robed men rushed out from a broken wall and surrounded the two.</p><p>An ice-cold killing intent enveloped the two of them.</p><p>“It’s them …”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized them at a glance. These people looked very similar to the Qin heaven Galaxy’s men of sacrifice who had tried to assassinate Lu Ming.</p><p>These people were filled with a thick murderous aura, like demons.</p><p>“Did you kill all the people here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, his voice extremely cold.</p><p>nonsense. Hehe, it seems that there are still fish that have escaped the net in the Han clan. They actually came back to seek death!</p><p>One of the black-robed men’s voice was cold. Suddenly, a Saber Light burst out from his hand and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>These people obviously did not know Lu Ming.</p><p>The black-robed man who attacked had a first level Divine King cultivation base. He thought that he could kill Lu Ming, who was only a sixth level celestial deity, easily.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>On his wrist, the bangle that QiuQiu had transformed into glowed, and a bolt of lightning burst out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black-robed man’s blade light shattered and the lightning struck the other party’s body. The other party screamed in pain and his body turned into dust.</p><p>One move, instant kill.</p><p>you … the remaining black-robed man was stunned. Then, he roared, ” kid, you’re looking for death!</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The remaining five black-robed men were furious, and they attacked together.</p><p>These black-robed men were all divine kings. The strongest among them had reached the third level of the divine King realm. Logically speaking, they should have been more than enough to kill Lu Ming and his companion.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had QiuQiu with him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and threw another punch. QiuQiu exploded with all its might and thick bolts of lightning burst out from his hands.</p><p>The five black-robed men were all covered in lightning.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Explosions rang out one after another as the five black-robed men screamed and flew back, heavily falling to the ground. Their bodies had already been charred, and they were no longer breathing.</p><p>Even that third level Divine King realm being was killed.</p><p>Ever since QiuQiu ate the few treasures that Lu Ming had brought out from star-moon ancient city, its aura had become stronger and its cultivation level had increased rapidly. Now, it was almost at the third level of the divine King realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; naturally, his strength had also grown more and more powerful. The lightning he unleashed was capable of killing ordinary third firmament divine kings with ease.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Wu Shan was ready to fight, but just as he was about to make a move, he found that the enemy was already dead.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, you live up to your reputation!”</p><p>Wu Shan sighed.</p><p>Wu Shan, these men of sacrifice are still here, which means that the Han family was just exterminated. Let’s look around again. There might still be survivors!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, the two of them began to search the area. However, they were much more careful. They restrained their aura and hid their figures, afraid that they would be discovered by the men of sacrifice.</p><p>The overall strength of the chutian Starfield was much stronger than that of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>As one of the two overlords of the chutian star field, the Han clan was also very powerful. They were much stronger than the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan of the Qin Tian star field. They definitely had experts at the fifth level of the Godking realm or above.</p><p>To be able to exterminate the Han family in such a short time, the experts dispatched by the other party must be very terrifying. If they were to encounter such an expert, Lu Ming and the rest would be in trouble.</p><p>“Be careful, there’s someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said as they walked. He and Wu Shan hid themselves.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Beams of black light shot up into the sky, breaking through the clouds and into the universe.</p><p>It was the men of sacrifice. Lu Ming and Wu Shan were a little puzzled that these men of sacrifice had suddenly left the place.</p><p>The two of them pondered for a moment and continued to search the area, but they found nothing.</p><p>“There’s someone over there!”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming and the other man saw figures flashing in front of them. They concealed their auras and approached carefully. They realized that it was a few black-robed men.</p><p>there are no more survivors here, but we just received news that the core members of the Han family are training outside on planet Scarlet. They probably know our secret, so the higher-ups want us to go to planet Scarlet to kill them!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said. Although his voice was not loud, Lu Ming and Wu Shan still heard him.</p><p>let’s go. This time, we can’t let the core members of the Han family off!</p><p>The other black-robed man spoke as well. Then, they soared into the sky and flew into the starry sky.</p><p>“There are still survivors from the Han family?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>From what the other party said, the survivors of the Han family might know important information.</p><p>Most of the black-robed men who had left earlier were also rushing to Scarlet Flame star.</p><p>the survivors of the Han family must not die. We must find the survivors of the Han family before the enemy finds them!</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“I know where the Scarlet Flame star is. Follow me!”</p><p>Wu Shan said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Then, the two of them soared into the sky and turned into two rainbow lights, rushing into the universe.</p><p>The two of them crossed the starry sky and arrived at the nearest teleportation platform. They stepped into the teleportation platform and rushed towards the Scarlet Flame star.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
