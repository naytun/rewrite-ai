How did this wretched and shameless fellow become so tall …”</p><p>LAN Ling quickly shook her head, throwing away the unrealistic thoughts in her mind.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming walking toward him with a flamboyant look on his face, Guan gulang was furious and shouted, a half-step Divine King trash is still acting tough here. Kneel down and eat dirt …</p><p>Guan gulang’s palm flew towards Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp slap rang out, and then a figure retreated.</p><p>The person who retreated was naturally Guan gulang.</p><p>Although he was the first to attack, Lu Ming was the first to arrive and slapped him in the face.</p><p>This slap was extremely heavy. Blood spurted out of Guan gulang’s mouth and all his teeth flew out.</p><p>‘</p><p>Guan gulang let out a roar like a pig being slaughtered. His lungs were about to explode.</p><p>His teeth had finally grown back after Qiu Yue had knocked them out. Now, his teeth had been knocked out again.</p><p>He was so angry that he wanted to tear the heavens and earth apart.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Guan gulang burst out with all his divine energy. He stared at Lu Ming with blood-red eyes and roared,”Brat, I’m going to cut you into eight pieces!”</p><p>A long and thin saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>He was still full of confidence and believed that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He had been too careless just now. He had thought that Lu Ming was only a half-step Divine King and was not on guard at all. That was why he had been slapped by Lu Ming.</p><p>He refused to believe that he would not be able to defeat a half-step Divine King with his strength.</p><p>The saber radiance tore through the air with a terrifying howl as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and waved his hands. Nine-clawed divine Dragons emerged and pounced at Guan gulang.</p><p>So many nine-clawed divine Dragons had drowned Guan gulang all at once.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Continuous explosions rang out. When all the nine-clawed divine Dragons had disappeared, Guan gulang was lying on the ground like a dead dog, twitching all over.</p><p>The more Divine Dragon phenomenon one conjured, the more powerful it would be.</p><p>Now that he could condense thirty-six nine-clawed divine Dragons at once, its power was shocking. It was not much weaker than Lu Ming’s door of domination.</p><p>If he could create more than a hundred nine-clawed divine Dragons in the future, his power would probably surpass the gate of God.</p><p>Of course, when Lu Ming awakened the origin divine power factor of the ruler’s divine power more often, the power of the door of domination would also increase sharply.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>The three heaven’s favorites with Guan gulang and the people who were watching the battle from a distance were stunned.</p><p>This scene was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>In their expectations, Lu Ming should be the one who was beaten into a pig’s head. However, in the end, it was Guan gulang who was beaten into a dead dog.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed beside Guan gulang.</p><p>ah, ah, attack together! Attack together and kill him!</p><p>Guan gulang screamed in fear.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other three young men shouted and attacked at the same time.</p><p>Three attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>activate! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. His divine power boiled and all his divine power was activated. In addition, the battle formula increased his combat power by four times.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The divine Dragon soared into the sky, and another 36 nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared and charged toward the three young men.</p><p>Each Divine Dragon image exploded as soon as they collided with the other party, turning into terrifying energy that rushed toward the other party.</p><p>A series of explosions rang out, and the three young men were forced back. Each of them spat out a mouthful of blood, their faces pale and their eyes filled with horror.</p><p>They were all second tier Divine King geniuses. The fact that the three of them were not Lu Ming’s match despite joining forces was truly terrifying.</p><p>my God! A half-step Divine King is this strong? ”</p><p>In the distance, the people who were watching the battle were also dumbfounded.</p><p>where did this guy come from? he’s too terrifying!</p><p>indeed, every time the great void Royal sacred Academy congregates, there will always be some monstrous talents who can’t be measured with common sense!</p><p>the geniuses have gathered. The winds and clouds meet. Another big collision is about to erupt!</p><p>Some people sighed and looked forward to it.</p><p>I look forward to the battle between all the geniuses of the great void sacred dynasty after the great void Royal sacred Academy. How exciting would it be?</p><p>At this moment, Guan gulang was completely shocked, his face full of confusion.</p><p>“Kneel down and eat dirt!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and grabbed at the air. His divine power burst out and he caught Guan gulang.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, let me go. Let me go. There are so many people here. If you kill me, my father will definitely not let you off!”</p><p>Guan gulang screamed in horror, his hands and feet dancing like a turtle with its shell caught.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He grabbed Guan gulang and shoved his head into the ground.</p><p>Guan gulang’s head was directly stuffed into the ground, leaving only a part of his body struggling outside.</p><p>This time, he was really eating dirt.</p><p>The other three young men’s expressions changed and they retreated frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered with these people. He went to LAN Ling’s side and quietly watched the battle between Qiu Yue and the residence of the nine serenity Heavenly King.</p><p>LAN Ling cast a complicated glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were becoming more and more unfathomable.</p><p>She knew that Lu Ming had awakened the origin secret skill. He had not even used the origin secret skill and he had already suppressed Guan gulang and the rest.</p><p>And she was not Guan gulang’s opponent.</p><p>“I can’t lose to him, I can’t …”</p><p>LAN Ling clenched her fists and gritted her teeth.</p><p>“God-destroying light!”</p><p>At this moment, a delicate cry came from the area covered by the ghostly mist.</p><p>Then, a divine light shot up into the sky, extremely gorgeous.</p><p>Qiu Yue finally used the God-destroying light. As soon as the God-destroying light was used, the thick ghost fog was split into two.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Two screams rang out in succession. The ghostly mist dissipated, and two figures fell to the ground, lifeless.</p><p>There were two heaven’s favorites from the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace. One of them was at the first level of the Godking realm while the other was at the second level of the Godking realm. They had been killed by Qiu Yue’s God destroying light.</p><p>Only the third level Divine King realm heaven’s favorite didn’t die. However, he was forced back. A deep wound appeared on his chest and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor shouted in fear, then turned around and ran.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said softly as an ancient scimitar appeared in her hand.</p><p>Qiu Yue waved her hand, and the scimitar flew out. It was like a brilliant ray of light, cutting across the sky at an unimaginable speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had caught up with the Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor was beheaded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
