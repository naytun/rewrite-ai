In fact, ghost hunter has another entrance. Those people outside don’t know about it!”</p><p>Yuan Huan said with a smile.</p><p>“There’s another entrance?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming was both surprised and relieved.</p><p>that’s right. The great void Holy dynasty thought that they had sealed the exit of the demon ghost. In fact, they did not know that there was another exit. If we want to leave, we can leave at any time!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>we’re not going out, mainly because war ancestor Jingyu has fallen. Even if we go out, there’s no one to protect us. All these years, we’ve been hiding in ghost domain to develop our forces, waiting for war ancestor Jingyu’s successor to appear!</p><p>“Also, do you know why Yuan Cong and the others wanted to kill you?”</p><p>Yuan Huan continued.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked subconsciously. He was very curious about this.</p><p>Yuan Cong and the rest were obviously on Lu Ming’s side and respected him as the war ancestor.</p><p>However, Yuan Cong and the rest wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>ever since war ancestor Jingyu died, the dark ape war clan has been hiding like a turtle in its shell. After so many years, some people’s thoughts have gradually changed!</p><p>“Some people feel that the underworld ape battle clan can’t hide in this place forever. They want to take the initiative to kill their way out and occupy their own territory, becoming the Overlord of a region. These people will follow the lead of the ape battle clan!”</p><p>actually, they have no ill intentions. They just feel that even someone as powerful as Jingyu has fallen, forcing our clan to hole up here. As for you, you’re even weaker, so what can you do? why don’t we just kill you and we’ll be free from the hands of anyone else!</p><p>Yuan Huan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded silently. It was normal for Yuan Cong and the rest to have such an idea.</p><p>however, as long as you pass the ninth level of the eighteen levels of hell and prove your talent, prove that you have the ability to rise up and lead our dark ape battle clan to glory, then the ape Warriors will definitely listen to you!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Thank you, clan leader. Lu Ming understands!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks and left.</p><p>Since the ghost hunter had another entrance, Shi Yan didn’t need to be in a hurry. He would stay here and subdue the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>Soon, it was time for the eighteen levels of hell to open.</p><p>Yuan Huan, Yuan Cong, Lu Ming, and a large number of nether ape battle clan’s powerhouses gathered on a flat piece of land.</p><p>This place was behind the nether ape war clan’s territory.</p><p>“Open the eighteen levels of hell!”</p><p>Yuan Huan said. Immediately, a nether ape battle clan expert stepped forward.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>A total of nine nether ape battle clan’s powerhouses shouted. Their bodies were covered with a resplendent black light as they slammed their palms heavily on the ground.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground actually cracked open, and a dark crack appeared.</p><p>Thick ghostly Qi seeped out of the crack.</p><p>war ancestor, the eighteen levels of hell have been opened. In each level of hell, there are countless ghosts, and each level of hell has a ‘King’. You can only pass if you kill the’ King ‘of each level, and then the entrance to the next level will appear!</p><p>“If you didn’t kill the ‘King’ of that level of hell, the entrance to the next level wouldn’t have appeared!”</p><p>Yuan Huan explained.</p><p>“How much time do I have?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s no time limit. As long as you can pass through the Nine Hells, it doesn’t matter how much time you have to spend!</p><p>Yuan Cong walked over and said.</p><p>“As much time as you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. This was beyond his expectations. He had thought that there was a time limit.</p><p>it’s because there’s no fixed time for each level of hell. It’s normal for some people to spend thousands of years to pass one level, but it’s common for them to spend tens of thousands of years to pass the ninth level. Therefore, there’s no time limit. No matter how many years you spend, your ultimate goal is to pass the ninth level of hell. However, we’ll wait no matter how many years it takes!</p><p>Yuan Cong said, his face still very cold.</p><p>“Tens of thousands of years?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>It seemed like it wouldn’t be that easy to pass through the Nine Hells.</p><p>Furthermore, he didn’t have much time to waste here. He had to pass this test within 180 years. He still had to take part in the examination of the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>“War ancestor, take this jade talisman!”</p><p>At that moment, Yuan Huan took out a jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and was a little surprised.</p><p>the 18 levels of hell are extremely special. The further down you go, the stronger you will be. If you encounter any danger and are really no match for them, you can crush this jade talisman and you will be teleported out!</p><p>at the same time, transfer a wisp of your aura into the Jade talisman. We’ll know if you’re alive or dead!</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. This jade talisman could save his life at a critical moment and at the same time, it could detect whether he was alive or dead.</p><p>If he were to die in there, Yuan Huan, Yuan Cong, and the others would not have to wait anymore. Otherwise, if Lu Ming were to die inside, would they not have to wait here?</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Jade talisman and inserted a stream of aura.</p><p>“Battle ancestor, remember, you can only pass if you kill the ‘King’ of each level!”</p><p>Yuan Huan reminded again.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then took a step forward and rushed into the crack.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>As soon as he rushed into the crack, the ghostly aura in front of him blew on his face like a strong wind.</p><p>Lu Ming set up a layer of divine energy on the surface of his body and then flew downward rapidly. Not long after, Lu Ming seemed to have passed through a thin film and descended into a huge underground world.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived in this world, the underground crack had closed up and disappeared. On the ground, a stone tower appeared.</p><p>This stone tower was only as tall as a person and had a total of 18 levels.</p><p>At this moment, there was a bright light shining on the top floor.</p><p>This stone tower represented the eighteen levels of hell. Whichever level a person was on, that level would light up.</p><p>They had a rough idea of the situation from the outside.</p><p>Yuan Huan and the others sat cross-legged in the air, waiting quietly.</p><p>They were all existences that had lived for countless years. Waiting for tens of thousands of years was as simple as eating and drinking to them. They had all the patience.</p><p>“Is this the first level of the eighteen levels of hell?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and looked around.</p><p>The world was gray and boundless, giving off a dull feeling and lacking vitality.</p><p>there’s a ghost king on every floor. Where is the ghost king? it seems I’ll have to find it myself!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. He then randomly chose a direction and dashed forward.</p><p>He didn’t have enough time. At most, he only had 180 years. He couldn’t waste any more time.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming had not flown far when gusts of chilly wind blew in the sky. Then, shrill screams were heard.</p><p>“Hand over your life!”</p><p>A shrill scream was heard. Then, a black shadow pounced on Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
