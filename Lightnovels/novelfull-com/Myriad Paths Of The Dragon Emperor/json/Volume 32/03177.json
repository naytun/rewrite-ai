Given Lu Ming’s current abilities, he would probably die if he was surrounded.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and escaped like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>While he was running, Lu Ming took out a jade talisman. He exerted force with his fingers and crushed the Jade talisman. A powerful force enveloped Lu Ming. In the next moment, he disappeared from the sixteenth level of hell.</p><p>This jade talisman was given to Lu Ming by Yuan Huan. As long as Lu Ming crushed the Jade talisman, he could be transported out of the 18 levels of hell at any time.</p><p>Although there were still more than 50 years before the great void Holy dynasty, Lu Ming did not want to try again.</p><p>If he wanted to defeat the ghost king and his Army on the sixteenth level, he would have to make another major breakthrough in his combat strength.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had broken through to the divine King realm, or the divine power source factor of the divine power of the creator had awakened for the second time, or the other five divine-grade divine powers had all awakened the divine power source factor.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming could pass level sixteen. Otherwise, there was no way.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to achieve any of these conditions. Without a great opportunity, it would take more than a few decades to achieve it. It would take time to accumulate.</p><p>For example, the divine King realm.</p><p>Breaking through to the Godking realm was originally a huge chasm. If an ordinary person wanted to break through, not only would they need a large amount of resources, but they would also need to accumulate experience, talent, and luck.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming controlled ten types of divine powers and it was even more difficult to break through.</p><p>Moreover, he had almost used up all the yin treasures he had obtained, such as the yin toy block. He only had two Yin crystals left on the fifteenth floor, which were not enough to support his breakthrough.</p><p>Since he could not pass in a few decades, Lu Ming might as well leave. After all, he had cultivated here for many years. He was afraid that Qiu Yue, LAN Shang, and the rest would be worried.</p><p>A wave of energy carried Lu Ming. In the next moment, he realized that he had left the 18th level of hell and appeared outside.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the area and saw the nether ape battle clan members staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the war ancestor!”</p><p>After that, all the members of the underworld ape war clan, including the first elder, saluted Lu Ming respectfully.</p><p>“Everyone, there’s no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly waved his hands.</p><p>These nether apes were all experts. Although he had become the new war ancestor, he couldn’t order them around arrogantly. Who knew, they might just ignore him.</p><p>If you want someone to be dead set on you, you still need to have both integrity and talent.</p><p>“War ancestor, I was blind before. Please punish me!”</p><p>At that moment, the great elder ape walked over and bowed deeply to Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, he was completely convinced of Lu Ming’s abilities.</p><p>He could already tell that Lu Ming’s cultivation base had already reached the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>When Lu Ming entered the eighteen levels of hell, he was at the eighth-level celestial deity realm. He had never heard that one trip to the eighteen levels of hell would allow one to break through two levels in a hundred years. This rate of improvement was too fast.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had passed the fifteenth level and entered the sixteenth level. His talent was even higher than Jing Yu’s. At this moment, he wholeheartedly supported Lu Ming as the new war ancestor. He would fight with anyone who disagreed.</p><p>“First elder, you are being too serious. You are also thinking for the underworld ape battle clan. How can you punish me?”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly helped the ape servant up.</p><p>The entire dark ape battle clan revealed a smile on their faces.</p><p>The new war ancestor was not only talented, but he was also friendly and broad-minded. This was undoubtedly the best for them.</p><p>battle ancestor, now that you’ve passed the test, we’ll return to our clan and hold a ceremony to let everyone in the underworld ape battle clan know you!</p><p>Yuan Huan walked over and said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After that, they returned to the nether ape war clan’s territory. Yuan Huan sent out orders to hold the inauguration ceremony for the new war ancestor, and countless nether apes gathered.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming had officially become the war ancestor of the underworld ape war clan.</p><p>In a large hall.</p><p>“Clan leader, how is the current strength of the dark ape battle clan? How many experts are there at each level?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“War ancestor, this bone talisman has detailed records. Please take a look!”</p><p>Yuan Huan took out a bone talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and checked the bone talisman with his spiritual senses.</p><p>The bone talismans were filled with the names of the nether ape battle clan’s experts, and there was a corresponding cultivation mark behind them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened and he was at a loss for words.</p><p>He was truly shocked.</p><p>The number of nether ape battle clan’s experts had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>The peak was naturally divine Lord realm powerhouses.</p><p>There were more than a hundred divine Lord experts in the nether ape battle clan.</p><p>Yes, over a hundred divine Lord realm powerhouses.</p><p>This was the divine Lord realm. Every one of them was an existence that could explode stars.</p><p>The dark ape battle clan actually had more than a hundred members.</p><p>Were there a hundred hidden divine Lords in all the aristocratic families in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor?</p><p>Not necessarily!</p><p>In other words, if the nether ape battle clan were to go all out, their strength might not be weaker than the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>This was the divine Lord realm. As for the number of divine kings, they were even more numerous.</p><p>Now that this power was under Lu Ming’s control, his heart started to beat wildly.</p><p>“Battle clan, this is all the strength of my dark ape battle clan. They are ready to be deployed at any time!”</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>“Calm down, calm down …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p>Although the dark ape war clan was powerful, they were still far from the great void Holy dynasty. Therefore, even if he were to bring the powerful figures of the dark ape war clan to the great void Holy dynasty to investigate Jing Yu’s murder, it would not work. If others found out about the relationship between the dark ape war clan and Jing Yu, they would probably be exterminated very quickly.</p><p>One had to know that Jing Yu’s faction wasn’t limited to just the underworld ape battle clan. There were other powerful factions that had been destroyed in the end.</p><p>Therefore, it wasn’t the time for the dark ape battle clan to make a move yet.</p><p>“Clan leader, senior Jing Yu was framed and killed in the past. I will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly. When the time comes, I will definitely need to use the strength of the dark ape battle clan. However, now is not the time. When I need your help, I will come and find you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming continued, ” now, I have to go to the great illusionary divine capital to settle an important matter. I don’t have much time left. I have to leave the demon ghost first. Clan leader, where is the other exit? ”</p><p>“War ancestor, take this bone talisman. When you come to the ghost domain in the future, you can send me a voice transmission at any time. I will take you to the other exit!”</p><p>Yuan Huan said.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming followed Yuan Huan to a secret place.</p><p>There was a large altar here. Yuan Huan told him that this was the other entrance to the demon ghost. Usually, the dark ape battle clan would seal it in case people from the outside world sensed it.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Yuan Huan shouted in a low voice, and divine light emanated from his hands, entering the altar.</p><p>The altar trembled slightly, and light filled the air. Then, a dark vortex appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
