Do you know why I chose to live in seclusion in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? Part of the reason is because of ghost hunter!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Because of ghost hunter? why?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious.</p><p>it’s because there’s a power residing within the demon ghost. This power is known as the dark ape battle clan. This power is extremely powerful. Most importantly, the dark ape battle clan was subdued by Jing Yu in the past. It was Jing Yu who took control of this power!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“There’s actually such a thing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>There was a powerful force within the demon ghost, and it was actually Jing Yu’s subordinate.</p><p>that’s right. However, not many people know about this. When Jing Yu was in trouble, the underworld ape battle clan retreated back to the demon ghost. The great void Holy dynasty was also afraid of this power, so they placed a seal at the entrance of the demon ghost.</p><p>the reason why I’m living in seclusion here is to find an opportunity to enter the ghost’s domain and regain this power. However, the entrance to the ghost’s domain has always been guarded by experts and there is a seal. I can’t get in at all!</p><p>this time, LAN Feng will open the seal and enter the ghost domain. She will also call you along. This is your chance, your chance to subdue the dark ape war clan!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>according to what you said, the dark ape battle clan is extremely powerful. With my cultivation, I won’t be able to subdue them even if I go in!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, the nether ape battle clan is very submissive to Jing Yu. As long as you show the ancient word ‘Zhan’ to them and reveal that you are Jing Yu’s successor, the nether ape battle clan will submit to you unconditionally. With the support of such a force, it will be of great importance to your future development!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“If I follow LAN Feng in and get killed by him the moment I enter, what should I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of death, but wouldn’t he be stupid if he went there knowing he was going to die?</p><p>“From what I know of LAN Feng, he is extremely prideful. This time, there will most likely be other people with him. LAN Feng will definitely not kill you in front of others, as that would be embarrassing!”</p><p>therefore, he will find an opportunity to kill you in a place where there is no one around. This will be your opportunity. You can find an opportunity to escape and then find the dark ape battle clan!</p><p>of course, there’s still danger. I’m just suggesting. It’s up to you to decide if you want to do it or not!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Alright, I’m off!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If he didn’t go, he would definitely be targeted by LAN Feng. At that time, he would be forced to leave the star sky Camp, and he wouldn’t even have the qualifications to participate in the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>He might as well go all out.</p><p>If he could capture the dark ape battle clan, it would be of great help to him in the future.</p><p>Going to the core of the great void Holy dynasty to reverse Jing Yu’s verdict would definitely be filled with danger. If he did not dare to take this little risk, how could he succeed?</p><p>alright, get ready. We’ll leave in a month!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>……</p><p>Very quickly, a month had passed.</p><p>Someone brought Lu Ming and the rest to a place in the Heavenly Kings District.</p><p>there are quite a few other heaven’s favorites. It seems like quite a lot of people have entered!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The more people who went in, the more opportunities he had to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Beams of light flew over from the sky.</p><p>It was LAN Feng and the experts of the LAN family head, as well as a group of experts from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Among the group of people that LAN Feng had brought along, each of them had a strong aura and was unfathomable. To Lu Ming, they were truly unfathomable and he could not figure out their depths at all.</p><p>LAN Shang speculated that LAN Feng must have brought someone at the divine Lord realm with her. Hence, he warned Lu Ming not to act rashly if he did not find a good opportunity.</p><p>LAN Feng stood in the middle of the crowd, his hands behind his back, high-spirited.</p><p>When he swept his gaze across Lu Ming, a cold murderous intent flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>LAN Feng issued an order and took the lead to rush into the sky.</p><p>They left the area of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and crossed the starry sky. After a while, they arrived at the planet at the entrance of the demon ghost.</p><p>The vortex was still floating in the air, slowly spinning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A group of experts under LAN Feng took the lead and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>Then, LAN Feng, Lu Ming and the rest also rushed into the vortex.</p><p>The world spun and Lu Ming found that they had arrived on a plain.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around.</p><p>The world was dark red, even the sky was the same.</p><p>On the vast plain, there was a black mist floating. It was ghost Qi.</p><p>a group of people will lead the way, and another group will guard the rear. The younger generation will follow me to guard the center!</p><p>LAN Feng’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>With a flash, everyone got into formation.</p><p>The cultivation of the younger generation was lower, and they were surrounded by many experts.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally in the middle.</p><p>LAN Feng cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. As expected, he did not take action. Instead, he gave an order,”Let’s go!”</p><p>Everyone rose into the air and flew toward the plain.</p><p>In the beginning, they were very fast and did not encounter any danger.</p><p>“Slow down!”</p><p>When they were about to leave the plain and arrive at a Hill, the old man at the front spoke, and everyone slowed down.</p><p>He slowly flew towards the hill.</p><p>啊啊啊!</p><p>Gah gah gah!</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of strange shrieks rang out, like the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves.</p><p>Then, a thick fog spread out from the hills, and countless black shadows flew out from the hills.</p><p>These black shadows were constantly twisting. They seemed to be ghostly shadows that were extremely terrifying.</p><p>These black shadows let out strange cries as they pounced towards the crowd.</p><p>However, LAN Feng and the others were clearly prepared.</p><p>“Offering formation plate!”</p><p>At the very front, a gray-robed old man growled. Instantly, the experts in front of him began to glow, and one array disc after another flew out from their bodies.</p><p>As soon as these array discs flew out, they burst into flames. These flames were purple-red in color and had a shockingly high temperature as they enveloped the black shadows.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>These black shadows seemed to be very afraid of fire. When they were engulfed by the fire, they made sizzling sounds and strange screams. Then, they turned into ashes and disappeared from the world.</p><p>Obviously, LAN Feng and the others had already learned from their previous experience.</p><p>There seemed to be a lot of black shadows in the hills, and they kept emerging endlessly.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared.</p><p>“Set up the formation and charge over!”</p><p>The grey-robed elder shouted.</p><p>Immediately, the experts in the surroundings took out their formation disks. Flames surrounded everyone in the center and they quickly rushed forward.</p><p>Soon, they were deep in the hilly area.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
