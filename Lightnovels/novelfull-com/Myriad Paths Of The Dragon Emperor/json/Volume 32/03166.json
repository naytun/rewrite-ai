The divine Lord of the dark ape battle clan had made his move.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>This region was completely boiling over. Divine Lord experts were engaged in a battle, and the might was shocking.</p><p>However, the divine Lords that LAN Feng had brought were at a disadvantage because the dark ape battle clan had more divine Lords.</p><p>There were a total of three Sir gods on LAN Feng’s side. One of the Sir gods was helping to kill the ghostly beings earlier. At this moment, he also rushed over and fought the Sir gods of the underworld ape combat clan.</p><p>three Sir gods, interesting. I will play with you!</p><p>Yuan Fei had not made a move all this while. At this moment, he muttered and took a step forward, his figure charging out explosively.</p><p>He originally looked very old, but at this moment, his body rapidly swelled up, turning into a giant ape over ten meters tall. His muscles were solid, and he looked extraordinary.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He didn’t even take out his iron rod and just threw a punch.</p><p>The void exploded, and a terrifying fist force blasted towards a divine Lord realm powerhouse.</p><p>That divine Lord’s expression changed drastically. His weapon was a battle axe, and he slashed it towards Yuan Fei.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Fei’s fist struck the battle-ax, causing it to shake violently. As for that divine Lord expert, his body shook violently as he spat out large mouthfuls of blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>let’s go, let’s go quickly. The dark ape battle clan is too powerful. We can’t fight them!</p><p>The injured Sir God roared.</p><p>“No, we must take the statue away!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared. He was extremely unwilling to retreat at this moment.</p><p>The four chains were so close to being cut off. At this moment, the dark ape battle clan suddenly appeared, making him so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yuan Fei let out a long hiss and charged towards another divine Lord.</p><p>This person was a divine Lord from the LAN family and had astonishing strength. He slashed out a shocking sword light at Yuan Fei, but Yuan Fei shattered this person’s sword light with a punch, causing this person to spit out large mouthfuls of blood and retreat.</p><p>“This dark ape battle clan is too strong. Young master, let’s go!”</p><p>The LAN family’s God monarch expert shouted and used his divine power to sweep LAN Feng up and rush into the distance.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared in his heart.</p><p>The statue of the primordial god was about to be in his hands, but it just flew away.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The people that LAN Feng brought all retreated and rushed into the distance.</p><p>“Don’t give chase!”</p><p>Yuan Fei stopped everyone.</p><p>In fact, they had the strength to make LAN Feng and the others stay, but they also had some concerns. They were afraid that killing these people would attract more experts, which would be disadvantageous to the underworld ape battle clan.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, LAN Feng and the others had all left, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the bottom of the statue and looked at it carefully.</p><p>senior Yuan Fei, why is this god statue chained up? could there be some terrifying existence sealed inside? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, the chains are only used to fix the body. It’s just a form of protection. There’s nothing terrifying inside the statue!</p><p>Yuan Fei’s body shrunk again, turning into an old nether ape.</p><p>“Then can I take this god statue away?”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his eyes lighting up.</p><p>if the war ancestor wants to take it away, he can. When we break the last chain, the war ancestor can take it away!</p><p>Yuan Fei said.</p><p>After that, the expert of the dark ape battle clan started to attack the last chain.</p><p>The last chain was already on the verge of breaking. They didn’t have to spend much effort to break it.</p><p>After the last chain was broken, nothing happened.</p><p>Lu Ming was relieved. Then, with a thought, the shocking feather painting scroll in his sea of consciousness flew out.</p><p>He intended to keep the statue in the startled feather painting.</p><p>“War ancestor Jingyu’s aura …”</p><p>When Yuan Fei and the other nether ape war clan members sensed Jing Yu’s aura on Jing Yu’s scroll, they were extremely excited, and their respect for Lu Ming grew.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the time it took for Jing Yu to die was extremely long. It had been hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>However, to a Godking, it was not too long. It was not even a star year.</p><p>A God King could live up to five star years, while a God monarch could live even longer.</p><p>As a result, many of the high-level godkings and divine Lords of the nether ape battle clan had seen Jing Yu in the past. Naturally, they were able to sense his aura from the scroll.</p><p>Jing Yu’s scroll flew out and quickly grew in size, enveloping the statue. With a single sweep, the statue was collected by Jing Yu’s scroll and disappeared.</p><p>“I’ll keep it for future research!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming, Yuan Fei, and the rest left the God statue mountain and returned to the nether ape war clan’s territory.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming cultivated in peace and waited for the eighteen levels of hell to open.</p><p>At the entrance of the demon ghost, LAN Feng and the others appeared.</p><p>“Damn the dark ape battle clan! I want to exterminate the entire clan! Let’s go and send a message to my father. Ask him to send experts here. I want to exterminate the entire dark ape battle clan!”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted hysterically, his eyes red, and he fell into a state of madness.</p><p>“Young master, you can’t!”</p><p>The LAN family’s God monarch expert said.</p><p>“Why can’t I?”</p><p>LAN Feng roared.</p><p>young master, it’s said that the strength of the dark ape battle clan is extremely powerful. Moreover, they’re hiding in the ghost domain and occupying an advantageous terrain. It’s extremely difficult to exterminate them!</p><p>even our LAN family would have to mobilize a lot of forces to exterminate the dark ape battle clan. However, the strength of our LAN family would also be severely depleted if we did that. We would be coveted by other forces. The clan leader would definitely not agree to such a thing!</p><p>The divine Lord expert from the LAN family said.</p><p>These words made LAN Feng calm down.</p><p>That’s right, the LAN family couldn’t possibly send a large number of experts to exterminate the underworld ape battle clan just because of a primitive god statue. The losses wouldn’t be worth it.</p><p>If LAN Feng really suggested this, it would instead make the LAN family head feel that he didn’t consider things thoroughly and look down on him.</p><p>One should know that the competition within the LAN family was very intense. Many people wanted to pull him down and replace his position.</p><p>but I can’t just give up on the primitive god statue like this. I can only borrow more people from Heavenly King Nine absolutes and take a look at the primitive god statue again. I hope that the primitive god statue is still there!</p><p>LAN Feng sighed in his heart and left the ghost domain. He went to borrow weapons from the nine extremes Heavenly King. When he got the experts and returned to the God statue mountain, he found that the original God statue was gone.</p><p>“Damned dark ape battle clan!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared angrily. He had thought that the primitive god statue had been taken away by the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>He didn’t dare to attack the underworld ape battle clan, so he could only leave the demon ghost. The experts of the nine extremes Heavenly King sect sealed the entrance of the demon ghost again.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to the nether ape war clan’s territory, he suddenly thought of a problem that made him anxious.</p><p>If Heavenly King Nine absolutes sealed the entrance of the demon ghost again after LAN Feng left, how would he get out?</p><p>He wouldn’t have to stay in the ghost domain and be the companion of the dark ape battle clan, right?</p><p>Lu Ming could not accept this.</p><p>His family and friends were all outside. If he did not see Lu Ming for a long time, he would be very worried.</p><p>Furthermore, he still had to reverse Jing Yu’s verdict. There were less than 180 years before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. He couldn’t miss it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
