After countless years, there were countless terrifying secret skills.</p><p>The heaven and earth thousand Dao chant had the magic of seizing the creation of heaven and earth, but was there no other wondrous technique that could be compared with it?</p><p>Not necessarily!</p><p>In the vast primal universe, there would definitely be one.</p><p>There were more than one or two ancient origin characters. From the quantity character formula, there were quite a few ancient origin characters.</p><p>The others could also get it.</p><p>As for secret skills like the ancient God tactic, there were countless of them in the universe.</p><p>There might be geniuses who were more powerful than Lu Ming.</p><p>“What kind of monsters will we meet on the day of the Grand void Royal sacred Academy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very much looking forward to it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man had killed several more sword bone beasts and obtained their sword bones.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill our way in!”</p><p>The others couldn’t sit still and rushed into the mountain.</p><p>People rushed in from all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As the crowd rushed in, the ground continued to crack open, and the sword bone beasts continued to rush out to kill the experts.</p><p>Some of the sword bone beasts were weak, some were at the third level of the God King realm, and some were even at the fourth level.</p><p>In an instant, many people with weaker cultivation were killed by the sword bone beasts.</p><p>In the endless Mountains, an intense battle unfolded.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling rushed in as well.</p><p>When they arrived near a huge mountain, the mountain rocks exploded and at least a dozen swordbone beasts charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There were weak and strong cultivators among them, but they worked together and pounced on Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a green-armored ancient God, larger than the swordbone beast and four times his combat power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a swing of the spear, several swordbone beasts were killed, including one at the third level of the divine King realm.</p><p>At the same time, Qiu Yue also used the God-destroying light. The divine light flashed and cut several sword bone beasts in half.</p><p>LAN Ling was stunned and did not intervene. Not only that, he still needed Lu Ming and the rest to take care of him.</p><p>It was another blow to her self-esteem.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying roar was heard. A sword bone beast pounced at Qiu Yue at an amazing speed. The wind whistled and created a terrible wind.</p><p>Fourth level of Godking realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu Yue turned around and slashed out her blade, clashing with the sword bone beast.</p><p>The swordbone beast’s body trembled and it was knocked back. Qiu Yue was also knocked back.</p><p>A fourth level Divine King was much stronger than a third level Divine King.</p><p>Furthermore, the breakthrough to the divine King realm would only get harder as one advanced.</p><p>It was even more difficult to break through to the fourth level of Godking.</p><p>Usually, those who could control sacred grade divine power could break through to the divine King realm if they were lucky.</p><p>For example, many of the godkings in the Qin heaven Starfield had broken through to the Godking realm by relying on the divine grade divine power.</p><p>However, it would be extremely difficult to make further breakthroughs after reaching the divine King realm.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to break through one level of cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, reaching the third level of the Godking realm was almost the end. It was almost impossible to break through to the fourth level of the Godking realm unless one had a heaven-defying opportunity.</p><p>Only by using a pill that cut off one’s own path of retreat like the king breakthrough pill could one break through.</p><p>&Nbsp; those who were able to break through to the fourth level of Divine King or above would have divine-grade divine power.</p><p>In other words, experts at the fourth tier of the divine King realm and above were almost all prodigies who could control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Such a person’s strength was very shocking.</p><p>For example, the heaven’s favorite from the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor who was at the third level of the divine King realm and had awakened the divine power origin factor once. However, if he were to fight against a fourth level Divine King existence, he would probably be no match for him and would be suppressed.</p><p>The further one advanced, the more difficult it would be to fight above one’s level.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The sword bone beast pounced at Qiu Yue again.</p><p>“The ruler’s blade!”</p><p>Qiu Yue murmured. The ruler’s blade appeared in her hand again, and the God-destroying light merged with the ruler’s blade. She slashed at the sword bone beast.</p><p>This blade was destructive as if it was rotten wood.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword bone beast was cut in half and died on the spot.</p><p>Qiu Yue stepped forward and removed the sword bone.</p><p>“Golden sword bone!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s surprised voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked happy. This was the first time they had obtained a golden sword bone.</p><p>It seemed that only sword bone beasts at the fourth level of God King realm and above had golden sword bones.</p><p>“Continue, let’s go deeper!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the two of you can go in. I’ll stay outside and hunt!”</p><p>LAN Ling said.</p><p>“You’re not going in with us?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, you can go in!”</p><p>LAN Ling shook her head.</p><p>She was following Lu Ming and Qiu Yue and there was almost no room for her to intervene.</p><p>“Alright, then be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not force LAN Ling. After he was done speaking, he and Qiu Yue headed deep into the mountain.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more swordbone beasts they encountered, and they would attack them from time to time.</p><p>After a while, another fourth tier Divine King swordbone beast charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used the door of Masters.</p><p>The door of domination continued to suppress the swordbone beast at the fourth tier of King God Realm. After a few consecutive strikes, the swordbone beast finally fell apart and was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>a fourth level Divine King is indeed powerful. Although it’s not difficult for me to kill him with my current strength, I’m afraid I’m not his match against a fifth level Divine King!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>This was only for the most ordinary fifth level godkings. It would be a different story if they were fifth level godkings who had awakened the divine power source.</p><p>Lu Ming was still not satisfied.</p><p>If other people knew Lu Ming’s thoughts, they would probably be infuriated.</p><p>This was the divine King realm. It was extremely difficult to skip levels. Lu Ming was only a half-step Divine King and he already had such combat strength. If he was not satisfied, how would the others survive?</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and took the sword bone.</p><p>The golden sword bone weighed 15 kilograms. If it was converted into a black sword bone, it would be equivalent to 1500 kilograms. It was enough to cultivate under the sacred heaven Jade wall for three days.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight.</p><p>This area was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Although many of the sword bone beasts had been killed, many of the outsiders had also fallen.</p><p>Those with insufficient cultivation didn’t even dare to go in. They could only hunt on the outskirts, which was relatively safer.</p><p>However, this time, there were really many heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Some of the heaven’s favorites were extremely terrifying. They charged in as if they were crushing dry weeds.</p><p>Lu Ming even discovered a few people whose abilities were on par with Qiu Yue and him.</p><p>“There are so many heaven’s favorites!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>There were still a few decades before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. Clearly, many heaven’s favorites have yet to arrive.</p><p>This was only a small group of heaven’s favorites that the bone sword clan had gathered, yet there were already so many terrifying existences among them. Lu Ming immediately felt a mountain of pressure.</p><p>It would not be easy to enter the top ten.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
