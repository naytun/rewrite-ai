Zifeng, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Then, he rose into the air and walked forward. He could not be bothered to pay attention to the people from the Jin family and the winged man family.</p><p>Now, it was useless to say anything more. When the time came, he would prove it with his actions.</p><p>“You … Say what? You should die!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family bellowed. His face was extremely gloomy, and he wished he could kill Lu Ming with one slap.</p><p>However, he really did not dare to attack Lu Ming now. If he attacked Lu Ming now, the nine absolutes Heavenly King would not let him off.</p><p>No matter how angry he was, he could only watch helplessly as Lu Ming left.</p><p>“You can be arrogant now, but one day, I’ll make sure you die without a burial place!”</p><p>The young men from the Jin family and the winged man family cursed in their hearts.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming, Wu Zifeng, and the rest returned to the Wu family first before they secretly returned to the universal camp.</p><p>“Old Liang, can these profound Frost Ice lotus seeds speed up the refining of the star’s core?”</p><p>In the room, Lu Ming was conversing with the quantity formula.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I can fuse a portion of it. It’s enough to let you advance to the eighth level celestial deity realm!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>that’s good. You can absorb these mysterious frost lotus seeds!</p><p>Lu Ming let the ‘measure’ formula devour the thirty-six Frost Ice lotus seeds. Then, he comprehended the various divine skills and secret techniques in peace and waited for the ‘measure’ formula to refine the energy.</p><p>With the profound frost lotus seed and the energy from the star core, the speed at which the ” quantity ” character art refined energy skyrocketed. In a short three years, he had refined a large amount of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously absorbed this energy and turned it into his own divine energy. Then, he started to break through to the eighth-tier celestial God Realm.</p><p>After a few days of charging, Lu Ming’s body exploded with a powerful aura. It was the aura of an eighth-level celestial deity.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through another tier, reaching the eighth-tier celestial deity realm.</p><p>The breakthrough of ten types of divine powers at the same time made Lu Ming’s divine power much stronger.</p><p>With his strong divine power, it was much easier for Lu Ming to cast various divine skills and secret skills, especially the origin secret skill,’master’s Gate’. Lu Ming’s strength had improved.</p><p>it’s a pity that the energy from the profound frost lotus seed has been used up. I’ll have to rely on myself to slowly cultivate next!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Compared to the others, his speed of improvement was already shocking, but he was still not satisfied.</p><p>The things he wanted to do were too difficult. 180 years later, he wanted to enter the top ten during the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. This was already extremely difficult. Even if he broke through to the eighth level of the heavenly deity realm, he didn’t have any hope.</p><p>Now, he could only do his best and take one step at a time.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and continued to cultivate.</p><p>However, an uninvited guest had arrived at LAN Shang’s residence.</p><p>A young man in luxurious clothes with his hands behind his back and extraordinary temperament descended in LAN Shang’s courtyard.</p><p>This young man was not a disciple of the universal camp.</p><p>Logically speaking, it would be very difficult for non-universal camp personnel to enter the universal camp. However, no one stopped this person from entering the universal camp.</p><p>In the courtyard, LAN Shang frowned as he looked at the man and coldly said, ” “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Third uncle, how have you been?”</p><p>The young man smiled.</p><p>don’t call me third uncle. I’ve been chased out of the LAN family by you long ago. I’m no longer your third uncle!</p><p>LAN Shang spoke indifferently, but his voice was filled with ridicule.</p><p>The young man smiled and said, ” “In my heart, you will always be my third uncle!”</p><p>“Don’t give me such hypocritical things. Tell me, why didn’t you stay in the great illusionary divine stage? why did you come to the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence? I don’t believe that you’d come here just to see me!”</p><p>LAN Shang said coldly.</p><p>The young man’s name was LAN Feng. LAN Shang was well aware of his character. This person appeared gentle on the surface, but he was sinister and cunning behind the scenes. His methods were vicious.</p><p>third uncle is right. I didn’t come here to see you. I came to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion for two things. One of them is related to cousin LAN Ling!</p><p>LAN Feng faintly smiled. Towards this third uncle of his, Lan Shan, he didn’t have the slightest bit of respect.</p><p>“It’s related to Ling ‘er? What’s the matter?”</p><p>LAN Shang’s eyes narrowed, and he had a bad feeling.</p><p>“Third uncle, do you still remember that you brought cousin LAN Ling to the Holy capital three hundred years ago?”</p><p>At this point, LAN Feng paused and smiled, cousin LAN Ling is a national beauty. The moment she arrived in the Holy capital, she shocked all the young geniuses in the Holy capital. How many people have fallen for her? ”</p><p>among them, the son of the Grand Tutor, Wu Fan, has unparalleled talent and is a peerless genius. All these years, he has been thinking about cousin LAN Ling. Even the Grand Tutor has personally gone to the LAN family to propose marriage. The entire LAN family has agreed to betroth cousin LAN Ling to Wu Fan. One of the purposes of my trip is to bring cousin LAN Ling back to the Holy capital and marry Wu Fan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Upon hearing this, a violent aura burst out from LAN Shang’s body. His glabella lit up, and a terrifying soul power swept toward LAN Feng like a Gale, forcing LAN Feng to retreat.</p><p>you want LAN Ling to marry Wu Fan? impossible!</p><p>LAN Shang’s hair and beard were standing on end, and his eyes were filled with the flames of anger, like a Mad Lion.</p><p>He was indeed extremely angry.</p><p>Back then, he had been Jing Yu’s teacher and the LAN family’s peerless genius. He had been hailed as the future of the LAN family.</p><p>But when Jing Yu was framed and killed, he was implicated as well, and his star core was crippled, turning him into a cripple.</p><p>At the same time, in order to cut off all ties with him and avoid being implicated, the LAN family announced to the world that they had expelled LAN Shang from the LAN family. The two of them had cut off all ties and had no relationship.</p><p>But now, the LAN family had actually agreed to marry LAN Ling to Wu Fan. Why?</p><p>“LAN Shang, this is the decision of the LAN family’s higher-ups, you have no right to refuse!”</p><p>LAN Feng roared.</p><p>“I don’t have the right to refuse? Hahaha, what a joke. Back then, the LAN family had already expelled me from the LAN family. I, LAN Shang, am no longer a member of the LAN family. What right do you have to decide Ling ‘er’s life?”</p><p>LAN Shang laughed.</p><p>the LAN family is expelling you, not LAN Ling. LAN Ling has the LAN family’s blood in her, so the LAN family has the right to make the decision for her!</p><p>you have to understand that Wu Fan is the only son of the Grand Tutor, while the Grand Tutor is the crown prince’s teacher!</p><p>LAN Feng said loudly.</p><p>LAN Shang sneered.</p><p>Although the LAN family was a large family in the great illusionary divine capital, with a long history and a deep foundation, they were still a little inferior to the Imperial advisor.</p><p>Not only was the Imperial advisor extremely powerful, he was also the teacher of the Crown Prince.</p><p>Wu Fan had taken a fancy to LAN Ling, and the LAN family wanted to use LAN Ling to form a marriage alliance with the state preceptor, so that the LAN family’s strength would be more stable.</p><p>However, LAN Shang had long been expelled from the LAN family. The LAN family’s actions were simply shameless to the extreme.</p><p>Ling ‘er is my daughter. She has nothing to do with the LAN family. She can’t marry Wu Fan. You, get lost!</p><p>LAN Shang’s expression grew colder and colder.</p><p>“LAN Shang, don’t be so stubborn …”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, I’ll have to do it myself!”</p><p>A cold light flashed in LAN Shang’s eyes. His soul power continued to spread out, pressing down on LAN Feng until she could not stand up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
