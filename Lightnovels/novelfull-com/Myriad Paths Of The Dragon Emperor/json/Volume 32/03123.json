They could even cross a large realm and defeat divine kings.</p><p>After reaching the divine King realm, their fighting strength would skyrocket and the increase was extremely shocking.</p><p>Since they were both at the first level of the Godking realm, a figure like him could definitely kill Chu Wei easily.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid. Instead, he was a little excited.</p><p>His combat strength had increased sharply over the years, and he was just about to go all out in battle.</p><p>come, let me see your strength. Don’t disappoint me like the previous two!</p><p>.com</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>His words made many people’s eyelids Twitch.</p><p>Lu Ming was really bold. He wanted to challenge the other party.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming could really fight against such a person? that was too terrifying!</p><p>“Although Lu Ming can defeat Chu Wei, he is definitely not this person’s match. The difference between those who have awakened the origin divine force factor and those who have not awakened it is too great!”</p><p>“That’s right, this gap is too difficult to cross!”</p><p>Many people shook their heads secretly. They did not think that Lu Ming could defeat the other party.</p><p>hahaha, a seventh level celestial deity actually talks to me like this. Good, good, good. Coming to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion this time really broadened my horizons. Then come. Let’s see how many moves you can block from me!</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion laughed wildly. Then, he shook his body and unsheathed the battle blade on his back. A blade energy soared into the sky, stirring the wind and clouds with a shocking aura.</p><p>Seeing that the other party was about to make a move, the divine power in Lu Ming’s body began to circulate wildly.

Then, a group of people flew over at high speed.</p><p>The next moment, a group of Young heaven’s favorites appeared in the sky.</p><p>The person in the lead was dressed in luxurious clothes and had a handsome face. He stood there and exuded a majestic aura.</p><p>“The third Prince, it’s the third Prince!”</p><p>“Greetings, third Prince!”</p><p>Many people saw this young man and bowed in greeting.</p><p>It turned out that this person was the son of the nine absolute Heavenly King, and also the third Prince of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, nine absolute mu.</p><p>He was also a peerless heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Jiu Jue mu, you want to interfere?”</p><p>On the fighting ring, the young man with a blade on his back said coldly. He stared at the third Prince like two divine blades.</p><p>nonsense. You’re a Divine King and you’ve even awakened the origin divine power factor. Yet, you want to deal with a seventh-level heavenly God from my nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. You can be shameless, but I can’t sit by and do nothing!</p><p>The third Prince said coldly.

A strong and ancient aura filled the air.</p><p>First level of Godking realm!</p><p>The third Prince, Jiu Jue mu, was also at the first tier of the God King realm and had also awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>The powerful aura washed away the aura of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon.</p><p>Jiu Jue mu, you’d better not interfere. This man killed a heaven’s favorite of the war god clan in star-moon ancient city. Therefore, he must die!</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King residence’s Paragon said coldly.</p><p>what a joke. In star-moon ancient city, there are chaotic battles and fights for treasures. Killing is a common thing. In the past, many people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion died in your hands. Are you allowed to kill our people, but we are not allowed to kill yours? ”</p><p>The third Prince asked.</p><p>“The person he killed was the son of an important figure in the war god clan!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion said coldly.</p><p>“I don’t care who he is. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>The third Prince was also very domineering.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose.</p><p>He had originally wanted to fight with the other party to test his own strength.</p><p>He did not expect that the third Prince would interfere and he would not be able to get what he wanted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not mind. If he wanted to make a move, there were many opponents.</p><p>“Jiu Jue mu, are you guys trying to bully me with your numbers?”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion said coldly.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the other heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion all unleashed their auras. Most of them were divine kings. The combined aura of so many people was shocking.</p><p>“So what if you have more people? Remember, this is the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>The 30,000 words were shouted coldly.

The auras of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s geniuses were crushed. Their bodies trembled violently, and their faces turned pale.</p><p>“What are you doing? Do you want to start an all-out war with my nine blades Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted.</p><p>“If you want to start a war, then start a war. Do you think I’m afraid of you?”</p><p>die! the third Prince shouted coldly. He was overbearing and did not back down at all. His aura continued to press down on the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s paragons.</p><p>At the same time, the auras of the others also gathered together and pressed down on the other party.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion trembled violently as if he was about to kneel down.</p><p>Their faces turned red as they desperately tried to resist. However, if this continued, they would be injured sooner or later and might even kneel down.</p><p>They were all top heaven’s favorites. If they were forced to kneel down, it would be a great humiliation to the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, an explosion seemed to have occurred in the sky.

Their bodies trembled and they spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“The aura of a divine Lord!”</p><p>Bone demon roared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock. He could also sense that this was definitely the aura of a divine Lord.</p><p>Lu Ming had felt sikong Nan’s aura and also the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s aura. This aura was very similar to sikong Nan and the nine absolutes Heavenly King. They were on the same level.</p><p>He was even more terrifying than sikong Nan, more profound, and unfathomable.</p><p>The others also showed a frightened expression.</p><p>There were so many people here, yet they were easily crushed by the other party. This person was definitely a terrifying expert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
