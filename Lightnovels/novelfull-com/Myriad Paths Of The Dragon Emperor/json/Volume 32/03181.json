I’ve indeed come today to ask for a favor!</p><p>“Brother LAN, please speak!”</p><p>Guan Gujian said without changing his expression.</p><p>“Brother Guan Gu, I would like to borrow a heaven Nirvana pill!”</p><p>LAN Shang went straight to the point and stated his purpose for coming.</p><p>“What? You want to borrow the Nirvana pill?”</p><p>Before Guan Gujian could speak, Guan gulang had already exclaimed exaggeratedly.</p><p>“You came to my father with bad intentions. You actually want to borrow the heaven Nirvana pill. Do you know how much it costs to make one pill? there are all kinds of rare divine herbs and nine alchemists. It takes ninety-nine thousand years to make one pill. Can you afford to borrow such a precious pill?”</p><p>“You’re borrowing the Nirvana pill for this kid, right? forgive me for being blunt, but this kid is only a half-step Divine King. Even if he breaks through to the divine King realm, he’s still a piece of trash. He won’t be able to catch the eye of the great void Royal sacred Academy. You guys should just give up on this idea!”</p><p>Guan Gujian shouted louder and louder. In the end, his face was full of disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming and LAN Shang frowned.</p><p>“Lang ‘er, that’s enough, stop talking!”</p><p>Guan Gujian scolded again.</p><p>Guan gulang smiled coldly and no longer spoke.</p><p>brother LAN, my son is indeed a straightforward person. However, he was right about one thing. It is not easy to concoct the sky Nirvana pill, and my guangu clan does not have many of them. Furthermore, we used almost all of them in preparation for the great void Royal sacred Academy. We really don’t have any left now!</p><p>Guan Gujian forced a smile.</p><p>“No more?”</p><p>LAN Shang’s frown deepened.</p><p>“That’s right, I don’t have any more. How about this? if brother LAN really does run into some trouble, just ask for any divine crystals. I can still take out several tens of thousands of high grade divine crystals or something.”</p><p>Guan Gujian smiled faintly.</p><p>“Brother guangu …”</p><p>LAN Shang wanted to continue …</p><p>“Teacher, let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up, turned around, and left.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party didn’t want to give them the heaven Nirvana pill. Was he trying to get rid of a beggar by saying that it would cost tens of thousands of high-grade divine crystals?</p><p>Rather than being humiliated by the other party, it was better to leave.</p><p>LAN Shang sighed in his heart. He cupped his fist to Guan Gujian and then stepped into the air.</p><p>“Hehe, you don’t even want a few tens of thousands of high grade divine crystals? you’re trash, but you still have pride!”</p><p>“There’s also that LAN Shang. A person with a crippled star core, do you still think he’s the same LAN Shang from back then? Asking for the Nirvana pill, why don’t you take a piss and look at your own reflection!”</p><p>Guangu lang sneered.</p><p>Guan Gujian also smiled casually. He didn’t scold Guan Gujian but said, ” my boy, don’t bother yourself with the small matters of these people. Your current goal is to cultivate properly and strive to enter the great void Royal sacred Academy. Do you understand? ”</p><p>don’t worry, father. I’m 100% confident that I can join the great void Royal sacred Academy!</p><p>Guan gulang said with confidence.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and LAN Shang walked side by side and returned to their residence.</p><p>“Sigh, this world is just so realistic!”</p><p>On the way, LAN Shang sighed.</p><p>Back then, when he was at his peak, many people had tried to curry favor with him. Guan Gujian and he had a very good relationship.</p><p>But now, all he asked for was a sky Nirvana pill, and he was ridiculed by the other party.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, you don’t have to worry about it. I still have fifty years. It’s not impossible for me to break through to the divine King realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming consoled her.</p><p>it’s fine. After so many years, I’m already used to it. Besides, I have more than one friend in the Holy capital!</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to their residence.</p><p>The next day, LAN Shang went out again. It was obvious that he was going to seek help from his other friends. However, he did not bring Lu Ming along this time.</p><p>However, not long after, LAN Shang returned with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Needless to say, he did not succeed again.</p><p>For the next ten days, LAN Shang would go out every day. But every time he went out with hope, he would return with disappointment.</p><p>Time passed quickly. They had already been in the great illusionary Holy capital for a month.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated in peace for the entire month.</p><p>The cultivation environment of the great illusionary divine capital was indeed extraordinary. The place where they lived was already considered remote, but the effects of their cultivation were not inferior to that of the star Camp.</p><p>On this day, LAN Shang went to look for Lu Ming with joy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, here’s your chance!”</p><p>LAN Shang said happily.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, what’s so good that you’re so happy?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll have a chance to cultivate in the bone sword race’s sacred heaven Jade wall!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“The bone sword race’s sacred heaven Jade wall?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The bone sword race’s sacred heaven Jade wall is an extremely famous treasure in the great illusionary divine sect. It is extremely helpful in comprehending the divine power factor of various divine powers. It can even help people awaken their origin secret technique!</p><p>not long ago, the bone sword race released news that they’re summoning people below the third level of Godking realm to help them with something. As long as they complete it, they’ll be able to cultivate under the sacred heaven Jade wall!</p><p>LAN Shang explained.</p><p>“What do you want me to help them with?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. At the same time, he was looking forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming was very interested in the fact that it would be of great help to the cultivation of the origin divine power factor.</p><p>He now had five types of divine-grade divine power, and all of them had reached ninety-nine percent awakening. If he cultivated step by step, it would take a long time for him to break through. However, if he was lucky, he might be able to break through in a short period of time.</p><p>help the bone sword clan enter a place and retrieve a material called ‘sword bone’. ..</p><p>LAN Shang immediately explained in more detail.</p><p>The bone sword race was an extremely powerful race in the distant past. At their most glorious time, they were even listed in the ten thousand ancient races. They were even more powerful than the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>However, it had already declined and was much weaker than when it was at its peak. It had become a race within the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>However, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. The bone sword clan’s Foundation was still deep.</p><p>The sacred heaven Jade wall was one of the bone sword race’s trump cards. Cultivating under the sacred heaven Jade wall would be of great help to the origin divine power factor.</p><p>However, the bone sword clan had a secret realm that contained a precious material called ‘sword bone’. It was extremely helpful to the bone sword clan, but this secret realm had a huge restriction. Those above the third level of Godking realm could not enter.</p><p>Even the bone sword race itself could not enter.</p><p>As a result, the bone sword race would invite many existences below the third level of Godking realm to enter the secret realm every once in a while to help them collect sword bones. They would also give out corresponding rewards.</p><p>There were all sorts of rewards and they were all very precious. However, he had never been given the opportunity to cultivate in the sacred heaven Jade wall.</p><p>Therefore, the news attracted many Young heaven’s favorites.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
