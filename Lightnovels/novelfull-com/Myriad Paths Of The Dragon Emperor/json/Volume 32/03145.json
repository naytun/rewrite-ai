His understanding and understanding of the’ door of domination ‘rapidly improved. His usage of the’ door of domination ‘was also improving.</p><p>As his understanding of the ‘master’s Gate’ deepened, not only would its power become stronger, but the amount of divine power needed to use it would also decrease.</p><p>Moreover, when he was comprehending the ‘Lord’s Gate’, he drew parallels from inference. Lu Ming’s understanding of the Lord’s divine power had also deepened. Lu Ming’s cultivation of the Lord’s divine power had already reached the limit of the first awakening. Now, Lu Ming felt that he was getting closer and closer to the second awakening.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating at the residence of the blue merchant for half a month.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly sensed a powerful aura coming from the back of the blue merchant’s residence.</p><p>An aura filled the air, containing a powerful Godking’s might.</p><p>Someone was breaking through to the divine King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he instantly understood.</p><p>it’s Ling ‘er who’s breaking through to the God King realm. This girl has finally succeeded after a period of closed-door cultivation!</p><p>LAN Shang revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>“So it’s the Blue Spirit that’s breaking through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>LAN Shang said. He then walked towards the back of the courtyard with Lu Ming following behind him.</p><p>Behind LAN Shang’s residence was a purple bamboo forest.</p><p>At this moment, LAN Ling was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the purple bamboo forest. Her body was surrounded by divine light, and she was extremely beautiful.</p><p>Her body constantly exuded powerful fluctuations, which even bent the bamboo around her.</p><p>However, this type of purple bamboo was very tough and did not break.</p><p>As time passed, the aura on LAN Ling’s body grew stronger, especially her dantian, which was emitting a dazzling radiance. Lu Ming seemed to have seen a star core in her dantian.</p><p>That’s right, at this moment, the divine fire within LAN Ling’s body had completely turned into a star core. This meant that LAN Ling was almost on the verge of a breakthrough.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>All of a sudden, LAN Ling’s body exploded with a strong suction force. The divine Qi in the world began to gather towards her body.</p><p>Fortunately, the divine Qi on the star peaks of the star Camp was so dense that it could not be dispersed. There was no need to worry about not having enough divine Qi. A large amount of divine Qi was absorbed by the Indigo spirit and converted into divine power.</p><p>About half a day later, LAN Ling let out a delicate cry and her figure shot up into the sky. She stood on top of a purple bamboo, floating like a fairy.</p><p>She had successfully broken through to the divine King realm and had completely stabilized it.</p><p>“Ling ‘er, congratulations!”</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile.</p><p>The godly monarch realm was a huge hurdle for the cultivators of the primal universe.</p><p>Hollow God, true God, and divine God were the process of condensing and strengthening the divine fire. They could be said to be the foundation of the immortal state. In the vast and boundless great thousand world, they were only the lowest level of existence.</p><p>As for the divine King realm, condensing a star core was equivalent to grasping the key to becoming a stronger expert. In terms of the cultivation of the divine realm, this was already considered to have reached a higher level.</p><p>In the primeval universe, there were countless existences from various races who were trapped in the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>Only one in ten thousand could break through to the divine King realm.</p><p>Once one broke through to the Godking stage, they would be on another level.</p><p>LAN Shang was naturally happy.</p><p>“Many thanks, father!”</p><p>LAN Ling’s crisp voice was heard. She then looked at Lu Ming with a cold and arrogant expression.”Lu Ming, so you’re here as well. Very well, I’ll settle the score with you. I’ve said it before, I won’t let you off after I reach the divine King realm!”</p><p>LAN Ling’s body exuded a powerful wave of energy. An ancient and desolate aura spread out and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ling. er, you …”</p><p>LAN Shang was about to speak but was interrupted by LAN Ling.</p><p>“Father, don’t plead for him. It’s useless no matter who pleads for him today. I must return the humiliation he gave me!”</p><p>LAN Ling said. She gritted her teeth in anger at the thought of Lu Ming slapping her on certain parts.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it that way …”</p><p>LAN Shang felt helpless. He knew that Lu Ming had defeated all the first-tier Divine King geniuses from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion and the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Even if LAN Ling had broken through to the divine King realm, she would not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>He wanted to persuade LAN Ling not to fight with Lu Ming. Unfortunately, as soon as he opened his mouth, he was interrupted by LAN Ling.</p><p>“Father, don’t say anymore. I don’t want to listen!”</p><p>LAN Ling said stubbornly.</p><p>There was an inexplicable smile on Lu Ming’s face. uncle LAN, don’t interfere. Let miss Ling do her best. Otherwise, she won’t be able to calm down!</p><p>LAN Shang looked at the evil smile on Lu Ming’s face and could not help but mourn for LAN Ling.</p><p>However, as a father, he was really irresponsible. He changed his mind. Beating was a sign of affection and scolding was a sign of love. Perhaps, Lu Ming and LAN Ling would develop feelings for each other after fighting for so long?</p><p>Therefore, he put on a helpless expression and sighed, ” “Forget it, you young people can do whatever you want. I can’t control you. I’ll take my leave first!”</p><p>After saying that, LAN Shang’s figure flickered and he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned that the blue merchant left so decisively.</p><p>This kind of father was really unreliable. Lu Ming despised him in his heart.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, there’s no one here now. Make your move. I’ll let you have the first three moves!</p><p>The aura of the Indigo spirit grew stronger and stronger, enveloping Lu Ming.</p><p>Her breakthrough to the divine King realm and the awakening of the origin divine power factor had caused her strength to increase by many times. Although Lu Ming’s strength was powerful back then, she was fully confident that she could suppress him.</p><p>“Today, I’ll make you beg for mercy!”</p><p>LAN Ling muttered in her heart.</p><p>“You’ll give me three moves, are you serious?”</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be smiling.</p><p>“Make your move, or you won’t have the chance to make your move!”</p><p>LAN Ling’s face was cold and arrogant, full of confidence.</p><p>alright, since you have such a strong request, then I won’t be polite. Take this!</p><p>open the door! Lu Ming shouted. His divine power surged and the ‘door of domination’ appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming used his most powerful unique skill,’master’s door’.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The gate of God trembled and pressed down on LAN Ling.</p><p>As soon as the door of domination appeared, a terrifying wave of energy swept towards LAN Ling.</p><p>“You … Is this origin secret skill?”</p><p>LAN Ling had been following LAN Shang for many years and had seen a lot. The moment he saw the door of domination, he recognized that it was an origin secret skill.</p><p>She could not believe her eyes. Lu Ming was only at the heavenly God-level and he had already awakened the origin secret skill.</p><p>At this moment, she finally understood the meaning behind the blue merchant’s and Lu Ming’s expressions.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>She used all her strength to try and block the attack of the ‘ruler’s door’.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could even defeat Yuan Yu with the door of domination. LAN Ling’s divine power factor had only been awakened once. There was a huge difference between her and Yuan Yu, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the God’s Gate pressed down, all of LAN Ling’s attacks and defenses were destroyed in an instant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
