He said,”Senior, are you alright?”</p><p>“You guys … Why aren’t you guys leaving?”</p><p>The old man from the Han family said and sighed.</p><p>“Hehehe, go, none of you will be able to leave!”</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed men had arrived. More than ten black-robed men surrounded Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>“Originally, this had nothing to do with you, but you just had to come to die. Then I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and Wu Shan.</p><p>.com</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with the black-robed man. Instead, he looked at Han Ying and the elder of the Han family and asked,”You two, are you from the Han family?”</p><p>Han Ying and the old man from the Han family were stunned.</p><p>“That’s right, we are indeed from the Han family. Who are you?”</p><p>The old man from the Han clan said.</p><p>we are here to save you. The Han family has been destroyed, but you can’t die!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>save us! Unfortunately, the other party is too strong!</p><p>The elder from the Han family sighed.</p><p>“You still want to save people? Let’s attack together and kill them. We need to end this quickly!”</p><p>One of the fourth level Divine King realm black-robed men shouted coldly. He then swung his sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>Since Lu Ming dared to ignore him, he would kill Lu Ming first.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The elder from the Han family shouted. Although he knew that he would die today, he was still extremely anxious.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Then, he took a step forward and his figure appeared in front of the elder of the Han family. He threw a punch at the black-robed man’s Saber Light.</p><p>When Lu Ming threw a punch, QiuQiu automatically wriggled and wrapped Lu Ming’s fist tightly.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with his opponent’s saber, creating a loud bang.</p><p>His opponent’s saber trembled continuously, and the black-robed man’s body trembled as he was forced to retreat.</p><p>What?</p><p>The others were shocked. Lu Ming was actually able to force the black-robed man to retreat. That black-robed man was a fifth tier Godking.</p><p>The Han family member’s eyes lit up. Perhaps, they were saved.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s kill this brat first!”</p><p>The black-robed man was shocked as well. Then, he roared and an even more shocking aura burst out of his body. He used all his strength and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>He had not used his full strength in that move just now.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other black-robed men also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>More than ten black-robed men joined forces, and their power was astonishing.</p><p>“Just as well, let’s settle this together!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he threw another punch.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>This time, his fist burst out with lightning. More than ten huge lightning bolts shot out from Lu Ming’s fist and charged toward the black-robed men.</p><p>The black-robed men’s attacks were struck by the lightning and immediately collapsed. Then, their bodies twitched and flew backward.</p><p>Other than the two fourth level Divine King realm experts, the rest of the black-robed men had fallen to the ground. Their bodies were charred black and they were no longer breathing.</p><p>These black-robed men were killed in seconds.</p><p>Only the two fourth level Divine King realm black-robed men were still alive, but they were severely injured. Their bodies were charred black and black smoke was constantly rising from them. Their auras were extremely weak.</p><p>QiuQiu had just broken through to the third level of the divine King realm and already had the strength to kill a fourth level Divine King. However, the power of the attack just now had been too scattered, allowing the two fourth level Divine King Black-robed men to survive.</p><p>Seeing this, Han Ying and the old man of the Han family were dumbfounded. They thought they were dreaming.</p><p>With one move, Lu Ming had annihilated more than ten black-robed men.</p><p>“Run! Run!”</p><p>The remaining two black-robed men fled in two different directions.</p><p>“QiuQiu, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out, charging towards one of the black-robed men.</p><p>The black-robed man was heavily injured and on the verge of death. His speed was greatly reduced, and QiuQiu caught up to him in a few moments. A saber extended out of QiuQiu’s body and slashed down.</p><p>The black-robed man resisted with all his might, but even at his peak, he was not QiuQiu’s match, let alone now that he was seriously injured and on the verge of death.</p><p>QiuQiu’s saber slashed down and split this person in half, killing him on the spot.</p><p>Following that, QiuQiu’s body spun around and charged towards another black-robed man.</p><p>QiuQiu and the black-robed man were getting closer and closer.</p><p>The black-robed man knew that he couldn’t escape, so he shouted, ” “If you kill us, you’ll also die, blood tongue attraction!”</p><p>The black-robed man suddenly stopped, turned around, and roared. His body emitted a strange red light. Then, he opened his mouth, and a small blood-red snake flew out.</p><p>This little snake was not an illusionary body. It was a real snake.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as the small snake flew out, it exploded and turned into a ray of blood light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The speed of the sanguine light was shockingly fast. It was too late for Lu Ming to Dodge it. The sanguine light rushed into his body and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully and realized that he was fine. He circulated his divine power but did not discover the existence of the sanguine light.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu had already caught up to the black-robed man and slashed down, killing him.</p><p>“Let’s go, we need to leave this place!”</p><p>After QiuQiu killed the black-robed man, it flew back to Lu Ming’s wrist and transformed back into a bangle. Lu Ming came to Han Ying and the others.</p><p>“Who are you people? Why did you save us?”</p><p>The elder from the Han family asked.</p><p>we’ll talk about it later. Let’s leave now. The black-robed men just now were only one of the waves. There are more black-robed men on this planet. If we encounter stronger people, we’ll all die!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Han Ying and the elder of the Han family nodded. They rose into the sky and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Soon, they flew out of the atmosphere and rushed into the universe.</p><p>“Let’s go to the nearest teleportation array!”</p><p>Han Ying said.</p><p>no, since these black-robed men are looking for you in this area, they must have set it up long ago. There must be experts guarding the nearby teleportation arrays. If we go, we’ll be walking into a trap!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then … What do we do?”</p><p>Han Ying’s face turned pale.</p><p>fly. As long as we fly far enough, we can use the teleportation formation to leave this place!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the group randomly chose a direction and flew at full speed.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the rest left, more than ten black-robed men appeared in a flash at the spot where the black-robed men were killed.</p><p>Looking at the corpses of the black-robed men, these black-robed men exuded a shocking killing intent.</p><p>“The target has escaped, most likely rescued by someone!”</p><p>A black-robed man said.</p><p>“Then what do we do?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>he has already mastered the blood tongue attraction technique. If he can use the blood tongue attraction technique in time, the other party won’t be able to escape!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said. Then, he extended his arm. Blood-red silk threads crawled all over his arm. They glowed and looked extremely strange.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
