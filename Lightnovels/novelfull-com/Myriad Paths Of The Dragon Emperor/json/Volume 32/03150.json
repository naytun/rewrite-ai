Even a peak Divine King would be suppressed by it, let alone LAN Feng.</p><p>The enormous soul force was as heavy as a mountain, almost forcing LAN Feng to kneel.</p><p>LAN Shang, just you wait. Wu Fan won’t be able to escape from the woman he has his eyes on!</p><p>LAN Feng roared and rushed out of LAN Shang’s courtyard in a sorry state. He flew away with an ugly expression.</p><p>LAN Feng had just flown a short distance when he saw a young man flying towards them. It was obvious that he was flying towards LAN Shang’s courtyard.</p><p>The young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated for a while and felt that he had encountered a problem. He came here to consult LAN Shang and happened to meet LAN Feng.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was flying toward LAN Shang’s courtyard, LAN Feng cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. Killing intent flashed in his eyes but he did not take action in the end. He passed by Lu Ming and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Who is this guy? This is the first time I’ve seen you, and you’re actually showing killing intent towards me? you must be crazy!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled and flew into LAN Shang’s courtyard. He saw Lan Shan standing there with a gloomy expression. He was frowning and seemed to be troubled.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, what happened? Could it be related to the young man I just met?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“You met him just now?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“Yes, he even revealed his killing intent towards me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“This person is indeed narrow-minded. He has killing intent towards me and even those related to me!”</p><p>LAN Shang’s expression was dark.</p><p>After a moment of silence, LAN Shang continued, ” “This person is called LAN Feng, from the LAN family of the great illusionary divine capital!”</p><p>“LAN? The LAN family?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>you’ve guessed it right. This person is of the same race as me. However, he has nothing to do with me now …</p><p>LAN Shang sighed softly. He did not hide anything and simply explained the matter.</p><p>He told her everything about how he was expelled from the LAN family and cut off all ties with them. Now, the LAN family was going to marry LAN Ling to Wu Fan for a marriage alliance.</p><p>“How shameless!”</p><p>After hearing that, Lu Ming felt a surge of anger.</p><p>He was not upset because LAN Ling was going to marry Wu Fan. In fact, he could not wait for LAN Ling to marry someone else. He simply felt unfair for LAN Shang.</p><p>After spending so many years together, he had already silently regarded LAN Shang as his teacher.</p><p>LAN Feng is a narrow-minded person. You have to be careful when you’re with Ling ‘er. If this person finds out, I’m afraid it’ll be bad for you!</p><p>LAN Shang warned him seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming wailed. When did he have to interact with the Indigo spirit?</p><p>Lu Ming really had unspeakable bitterness. He would not have a ‘love rival’ for no reason, right? he was really wronged.</p><p>“Forget it, let’s not talk about this for now. What are you here for?”</p><p>LAN Shang changed the topic.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming asked about his cultivation problems and LAN Shang began to guide him.</p><p>After Lu Ming was enlightened, he returned to his residence to cultivate.</p><p>……</p><p>In an elegant garden in the Heavenly King District, it was bustling with life.</p><p>A banquet was being held here.</p><p>The main character of this banquet was LAN Feng.</p><p>LAN Feng was the heaven’s favorite of the great illusionary divine capital’s LAN family. His status was not something that the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s big families could compare to. This time, there were naturally a bunch of Young heaven’s favorites trying to curry favor with him.</p><p>For example, the Jin family, the Qin family, the winged ones family, the sun family, and so on.</p><p>This time, it was the paragons of these aristocratic families who had invited LAN Feng to a banquet.</p><p>LAN Feng sat on the main seat, and the paragons of the various major worlds sat on both sides.</p><p>“Brother Lan’s presence is truly an honor. Come, this Jin offers brother LAN a toast!”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the Jin family raised his cup and drank it all in one go.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>LAN Feng replied casually and took a sip of the wine.</p><p>In the depths of his eyes, there was a faint trace of disdain.</p><p>He did not care about these so-called geniuses of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. In addition, he was not in a good mood because of the matter with LAN Shang.</p><p>Seeing that LAN Feng’s attitude wasn’t very enthusiastic, everyone also chatted.</p><p>“By the way, brother LAN, did you come for the divine power origin bead?”</p><p>The elite of the Jin clan suddenly said.</p><p>“A divine power origin bead?”</p><p>LAN Feng was surprised, and his eyes flashed, could it be that a divine power source Pearl appeared in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>“Brother LAN, you don’t know?”</p><p>The chosen of the Jin clan asked.</p><p>He also knew that LAN Feng most likely didn’t know about the appearance of the divine power source Pearl in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He had asked on purpose just now, so he naturally had his own scheme.</p><p>“Did a divine power origin bead really appear? tell me, what’s going on?”</p><p>LAN Feng suddenly became spirited.</p><p>“Brother LAN, a divine power origin bead has indeed appeared. Furthermore, it’s in the hands of a young man from the universal camp!”</p><p>The Jin clan’s heaven’s favorite said.</p><p>“Who has it? Could it be that this person has obtained the divine power origin bead but hasn’t refined it?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked with some urgency.</p><p>A divine power source Pearl was something that could only be found by chance. Even in the great illusionary divine capital, it was extremely rare. He did not expect that he would actually have news of a divine power source Pearl when he came to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. His eyes immediately became fiery.</p><p>there’s definitely no refinement. That young man is called Lu Ming. He’s cultivating in the universal camp!</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said with certainty.</p><p>that’s right. The divine power origin Pearl must still be in Lu Ming’s hands. Brother LAN, if you want it, you can take it!</p><p>A genius from the winged man family spoke.</p><p>“Snatch it? What kind of person do you think I am?”</p><p>LAN Feng’s face was gloomy.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I said the wrong thing. Brother LAN, please don’t blame me!”</p><p>The winged man family’s elite was shocked and hurriedly apologized.</p><p>LAN Feng nodded. since the person called Lu Ming has not refined the divine power source Pearl, he must not have awakened the divine power factor. Therefore, he has no use for it. Let’s buy the divine power source Pearl then!</p><p>LAN Jiu, make a trip to the star sky Camp and find Lu Ming. Ask him to come and see me!</p><p>LAN Feng ordered one of his men.</p><p>“Yes! Young master!”</p><p>On the side, a blue-clothed youth stepped out and bowed to LAN Feng. Then, he turned into a rainbow light and left the place.</p><p>The eyes of the young men from the Jin family and the prodigies from the winged people family flickered. They did not say much or remind LAN Feng that Lu Ming had not only awakened the origin divine power factor but also the origin secret skill.</p><p>They wanted Lu Ming to become enemies with LAN Feng so that they could kill him with the help of others.</p><p>If he reminded her, it might not be easy to borrow the saber.</p><p>At Lu Ming’s residence, he was comprehending the God’s divine power.</p><p>&Nbsp; as he cultivated, his understanding of the God Power grew deeper and deeper. He felt that his second awakening wasn’t far away.</p><p>However, it wasn’t that easy to achieve the second awakening. He still needed luck.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming opened his eyes because he felt an aura enveloping the courtyard that he was staying in. It was unbridled and harbored ill intentions.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and walked out of the room.</p><p>Qiu Yue obviously felt it too. She ended her cultivation and walked out of the room.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and then came to the outside of the courtyard.</p><p>Outside the courtyard, a young man in a blue robe stood high in the sky with his hands behind his back. He looked down at Lu Ming with an arrogant look. It was LAN Feng’s servant, LAN Jiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
