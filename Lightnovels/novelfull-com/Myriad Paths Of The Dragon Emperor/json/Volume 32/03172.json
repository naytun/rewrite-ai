However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>He felt a strange energy from the swordsman in Black’s sword gleam. It followed Lu Ming’s spear and rushed into Lu Ming’s body. It surged into his sea of consciousness and bombarded Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul trembled slightly and he felt a slight piercing pain.</p><p>“Soul attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>This headless swordsman in black could actually launch a soul attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had obtained quite a lot of the demon night spring. Over the years, he had refined the demon night spring and his soul had been tempered. He was much stronger than cultivators of the same level. The move just now did not cause any substantial damage to Lu Ming but it was enough to surprise him.</p><p>Soul attacks had always been special.</p><p>The reason why the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor were so terrifying was because they knew how to use soul attacks. They were able to greatly affect one’s state of mind, and one would not be able to unleash even half of their full strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword rang out again. The headless swordsman in black launched another attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, there was the sound of a sword ringing behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Unknowingly, five black-robed Knights had appeared behind Lu Ming. There were a total of seven of them and they attacked Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The black sword gleam formed a net of sword Qi and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Weng ~!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and swept it across, destroying all the sword gleams.</p><p>However, there was a strange energy in every sword gleam. It rushed toward Lu Ming, trying to attack his soul.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the shocking feather painting scroll.</p><p>With a single thought, the shocking feathers painting scroll surrounded Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>When the attacks landed on the startled feathers painting, they were all blocked.</p><p>Soul attacks were ineffective against Lu Ming. He swept his spear in all directions and crushed the seven to eight headless swordsmen in black. All of them exploded.</p><p>However, after the headless swordsman’s body exploded, it turned into black smoke and condensed again not far away.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, intense battle cries were heard. A few mountains not far away had black lights rising into the sky and a few black shadows were charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>These black figures were not headless swordsmen in black, but ghosts in black armor and holding giant swords.</p><p>These ghosts were extremely fast. Their huge swords cut through the air and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his long spear!</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The huge sword hit the long spear. Lu Ming’s long spear shook and the few black-armored swordsmen were sent flying.</p><p>pure strength, interesting …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He could feel that these black-armored swordsmen were very powerful, even stronger than the headless swordsman, but they did not have the power of a soul.</p><p>The tenth level was indeed different.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A golden light pierced through the air. The headless swordsman in black and the swordsman in black armor charged at Lu Ming at the same time. The net of swords was like silk, enveloping Lu Ming.</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The divine energy in his body surged wildly. The long spear shook and rays of spear radiance shot out like meteors.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The headless swordsmen in black and the black-armored swordsmen were all shattered. This time, the headless swordsmen in black could not reform their bodies.</p><p>As long as the power was strong enough, it could completely destroy the headless swordsmen in black, making it difficult for them to reform.</p><p>After defeating the headless swordsmen in black and black armor, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left.</p><p>However, there were swordsmen in black and black armor everywhere on the tenth floor. Lu Ming was being surrounded.</p><p>Lu Ming charged all the way. Fortunately, this place was the same as the ninth level. There was a stone pillar at a fixed distance. Once he stepped on the stone pillar, the swordsmen in black and black armor seemed to have lost sight of Lu Ming and dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming rested for a while before he continued on his journey in search of the king of the tenth level.</p><p>The territory of the tenth level was slightly larger. Lu Ming went around in circles, killing ghosts and honing his various divine skills and secret skills while searching for the ghost king.</p><p>After nine attempts, Lu Ming already had some experience. Wherever the ghost king was, the number of ghost kings would definitely be the highest. Lu Ming specifically went to the place with the most ghosts.</p><p>This time, it only took slightly more than a year before Lu Ming found the location of the ghost king.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The battle cries shook the sky. A large number of headless swordsmen in black and black armor gathered on a mountain peak.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was a headless swordsman in black riding on a headless warhorse. His aura was overbearing.</p><p>“Ghost king!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This headless swordsman was definitely the ghost king of this floor as his aura was at the divine King realm.</p><p>die! the ghost king shouted. Thousands of headless swordsmen in black and black armor charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were more than a thousand half-step divine kings, including the headless swordsman in black who attacked the soul and the powerful swordsman in black armor. When they worked together, their power was terrifying.</p><p>Even if ordinary heaven’s favorites could pass through the ninth level, they would still be at a disadvantage when faced with this soul attack. If they were not careful, they would lose.</p><p>However, soul attacks were ineffective against Lu Ming. Therefore, it was not difficult for him this time.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a green-armored ancient God and charged into the group of swordsmen in black and black armor.</p><p>Lu Ming did not set up any defense against the attacks of the swordsmen in black. He waved his long spear and wherever it passed, the swordsmen in black and black armor would explode one by one.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming charged through and headed straight for the ghost king.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The headless swordsman and ghost king were headless. No one knew where the voice came from. Then, the warhorse stomped on the air, brandishing its sword and charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and Lu Ming’s figure retreated slightly.</p><p>“He’s still at the first level of the Godking realm. However. he has. soul spirit attack …”</p><p>After the exchange of moves, Lu Ming had a rough idea of the abilities of the headless swordsman on the warhorse.</p><p>The strength of this ‘ghost king’ was equivalent to an existence that had awakened the second godly power factor, which was comparable to the Golden-furred Zombie King on the ninth floor.</p><p>However, this ‘ghost king’ contained a soul attack, which was obviously more difficult to deal with than the Zombie King.</p><p>To the other geniuses, the difficulty of the tenth floor might be several times higher than the ninth floor.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, it was less difficult than the ninth level.</p><p>The startling feather painting scroll blocked the soul attack, which had no effect on him. Lu Ming held his spear and charged toward the ‘ghost king’.</p><p>Without the soul attack, the ghost king’s abilities were inferior to the Zombie King’s. Lu Ming did not even need to use the door of Masters to suppress the other party.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Dragon roars shook the sky. Nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared one after another and pounced toward the ghost king. At the same time, the ice chains were like long snakes that coiled toward the ghost king.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he cast the three apocalyptic strikes and attacked his opponent.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle. After a few dozen moves, Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand, forcing the other party to retreat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
