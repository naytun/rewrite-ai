However, the more he read, the brighter his eyes became.</p><p>“Amazing, this is really amazing …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed with emotion.</p><p>The blue merchant’s understanding of the ruler’s divine power was too deep. Some of the insights in it simply made Lu Ming clap his hands and exclaim in admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his understanding of the ruler’s divine power was rapidly deepening.</p><p>In the following time, Lu Ming was immersed in the comprehension of the ruler’s divine power. Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed.</p><p>After twenty years of bitter cultivation, Lu Ming’s understanding of the ruler’s divine power had reached a new height. However, he was still a long way from the second awakening of the origin divine power factor.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming received a voice transmission from LAN Shang. He said that he had sorted out some cultivation insights on the other divine powers that Lu Ming cultivated and asked him to get them.</p><p>.com</p><p>Lu Ming naturally ran over eagerly.</p><p>During this period of time, he had already tasted the benefits of the scrolls from LAN Shang. With this kind of cultivation experience as a reference, his cultivation speed was much faster, and he could avoid many detours and save a lot of time.</p><p>This time, the blue merchant gave Lu Ming six types of scrolls. They were the other six types of divine power that Lu Ming cultivated.</p><p>Although LAN Shang had only cultivated one type of God’s divine power, his realm was too high back then. He had seen other experts use it and his understanding of other divine powers far exceeded Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Many thanks, uncle LAN!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the scroll and could not stop smiling.</p><p>you should focus on your cultivation. If there’s anything you don’t understand, feel free to come and find me. It won’t be long before you have an important mission to complete. It’s a matter of whether or not you can reverse Jingyu’s verdict!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming had two major things on his mind.</p><p>One of them was about Jing Yu. He had sworn an oath that he would help Jing Yu reverse his verdict.</p><p>The other thing was that he had to reach the divine Lord realm as soon as possible before he went to find Xie nianqing.</p><p>As such, when he heard that he would be able to reverse Jing Yu’s verdict, he immediately perked up.</p><p>“I’ll tell you about this in the future. For now, you just need to cultivate properly!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only take his leave.</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming could not wait to open the scroll regarding the inextinguishable sword force and read it in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming’s days continued to be peaceful and he focused on cultivation.</p><p>His understanding of the inextinguishable sword force was rapidly deepening.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another twenty years had passed.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming’s body suddenly exuded an ancient aura.</p><p>This was the aura that could only be emitted by someone who had awakened the origin divine power factor. However, this aura was slightly different from that of a ruler’s divine power awakening the origin divine power factor.</p><p>This was the origin divine power factor that the inextinguishable sword force had awakened.</p><p>After twenty years of cultivation, Lu Ming’s inextinguishable sword force had finally awakened the divine power factor.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had two types of divine power. He had awakened the origin divine power factor, which increased his combat strength by another level.</p><p>Moreover, during this period of time, Lu Ming had also been slowly nourishing the Overlord Spear’s power. His Overlord Spear’s power had also been improving and it had already condensed divine fire.</p><p>“I’m going to ask uncle LAN Shang for advice!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the inextinguishable sword force and headed to the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>During this period of time, he had accumulated some questions and wanted to ask LAN Shang.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the courtyard where Lan Shang was staying and saw LAN Ling.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>LAN Ling snorted coldly when she saw Lu Ming. She looked as if she could not wait to eat him up. It was obvious that she was still brooding over Lu Ming ‘teaching her a lesson’ previously.</p><p>Lu Ming grinned at LAN Ling. He then ignored her and went to look for LAN Shang.</p><p>After finding LAN Shang, Lu Ming asked all his doubts. LAN Shang also patiently guided him.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming went back and forth between his courtyard and the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>One moment, he was in closed-door cultivation here, and the next moment, he was in closed-door cultivation there.</p><p>Lu Ming’s schedule was packed every day. He took turns to cultivate the various divine skills and secret skills that he needed to comprehend.</p><p>His days were very fulfilling.</p><p>More than a hundred years passed just like that.</p><p>It had been 150 years since Lu Ming returned from the chutian Star Zone.</p><p>After a period of bitter cultivation, Lu Ming’s Foundation was solid. He had improved steadily in all aspects and his abilities had improved greatly.</p><p>First of all, Lu Ming had already cultivated to the peak of the first awakening of the divine power factor. He was not far from the second awakening.</p><p>Of course, if he wanted to cross this step, he would need luck.</p><p>The reason why he could cultivate so quickly was inseparable from the guidance of the blue merchant. After all, the blue merchant had cultivated the ruler’s divine power in the past. Therefore, Lu Ming’s ruler’s divine power had improved the fastest.</p><p>In addition, he had finally achieved a breakthrough and successfully comprehended the battle character formula.</p><p>However, the success rate of triggering it was only one in a dozen, the probability was extremely low.</p><p>In addition, after so many years, the ” quantity ” formula had refined a portion of the energy in the star’s core and passed it to Lu Ming, allowing his cultivation to improve greatly.</p><p>Not only did he cultivate the Overlord spear force to the peak, his cultivation even broke through in one go, reaching the seventh level celestial deity realm.</p><p>It could be said that in the past hundred years, Lu Ming had improved in all aspects. His abilities had undergone a qualitative change and had soared by a large margin.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that his potential had not been exhausted. Many of them had not reached their limits. If he continued to seclude himself, he could still make a breakthrough. Lu Ming planned to seclude himself and cultivate for a period of time, then go out and hone himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when a loud roar suddenly came from outside.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and frowned slightly.</p><p>“Could it be that someone is challenging me?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>There was a rule in the universal camp. As long as a newly-joined genius defeated someone and occupied a courtyard, they would have a 50-year safety period.</p><p>In these 50 years, you can refuse the challenges of others.</p><p>When he had just joined the universal camp, many people had challenged Lu Ming but he had rejected them all.</p><p>Now, 50 years had long passed, and others could already challenge him.</p><p>“Is it the Jin family, the Qin family, or the winged ones family?”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. He then stood up and walked out.</p><p>Just as he walked out of the room, he saw Qiu Yue walking out of the room as well.</p><p>Qiu Yue had been in closed-door cultivation all these years to break through to the Godking realm.</p><p>However, the divine King realm wasn’t that easy to break through. Even with Qiu Yue’s talent and the divine eye Lord’s inheritance, she still couldn’t break through.</p><p>“Young master, what’s going on?”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“I don’t know, let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He opened the door of the courtyard and walked out.</p><p>The moment he walked out, he saw a group of people surrounding the courtyard.</p><p>All of them were the prodigies of the universal camp and their eyes were fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally out?”</p><p>At the front was a young man in a golden robe. He was the first to speak. From his voice, it was obvious that he was the one who had asked Lu Ming to get the hell out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
