How about this? name a price and sell it to me!</p><p>The nine blade Heavenly King wanted to buy the divine power Pearl.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to sell it!” Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“I’m not selling!”</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s eyes narrowed, and they said, ” “You are rejecting this King!”</p><p>His voice was cold and he looked down at Lu Ming with a high and mighty attitude.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, given his status, the other juniors would not dare to reject him. However, Lu Ming had rejected him.</p><p>“I said I’m not selling it. Can’t you understand, Heavenly King?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s temper flared up. No matter who you were, his tone was not pleasant.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were beating wildly. Lu Ming actually dared to speak to the nine saber Heavenly King in such a tone.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s true that a newborn calf is not afraid of a Tiger!”</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King chuckled. Anyone could hear the cold killing intent in his voice.</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King was furious.</p><p>“Nine blades, if they don’t want to sell it to you, are you going to force them to sell it to you? A Heavenly King, aren’t you afraid of being laughed at?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes spoke. He shifted his body slightly and blocked Lu Ming, preventing the nine saber Heavenly King from launching an attack.</p><p>“Good, very good!”</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King’s voice was cold. He then glanced at Lu Ming and said, the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy is coming soon. Let’s meet at the great void Royal sacred Academy then. I’ll show you the true geniuses of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>“If there’s nothing else, please!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes waved his hand and asked him to leave.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine sabers didn’t stay any longer.

But I’m telling you, the divine power origin bead was obtained by Lu Ming. It belongs to him. If anyone else dares to use underhanded means to seize the divine power origin bead, don’t blame me for being impolite!</p><p>After which, the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s gaze swept across everyone present and warned.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Indeed, previously, many people had their eyes on the divine power source Pearl and were thinking of ways to snatch it from Lu Ming. Now that they heard what the nine absolutes Heavenly King said, many people dispelled the idea.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, no one could withstand the wrath of the nine absolute Heavenly King.</p><p>“Lu Ming, give me the divine power origin bead. I’ll help you break the restriction so that you can keep it!”</p><p>Then, the nine Arts Heavenly King said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to express his gratitude. He then handed the divine power origin Pearl to the nine absolutes Heavenly King.</p><p>He was not worried about Heavenly King Nine cuts. If Heavenly King Nine cuts wanted the divine power Pearl, he would not be able to keep it.</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes took the divine power origin Pearl and used his divine power to erase the restrictions on it before returning it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took the divine power origin bead and put it into his storage ring with a thought.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It was much more convenient this way. Otherwise, it would be too troublesome to hold onto the divine power origin bead every day.</p><p>alright, let’s all go back. There are less than 200 years before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy. This is a great opportunity for all of you. Once you are able to join the great void Royal sacred Academy, not only will you be able to enjoy top-notch cultivation resources, but it will also be the foundation for you to achieve meteoric success!</p><p>it’s not impossible for us to establish a new mansion and Army, and it will become the new Heavenly King mansion in the future. So, you must work hard to cultivate and improve yourself during this time!</p><p>Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘voice rang out.</p><p>“Yes, Heavenly King!”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>The young heaven’s favorites were especially excited.</p><p>The star Battalion was just the foundation.</p><p>Only those who joined the universal camp were qualified to participate in the selection of the great void Royal sacred Academy. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even be qualified to participate.</p><p>Their ultimate goal was to enter the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>All the geniuses of the great void Holy dynasty were gathered there.</p><p>In history, 90% of the great void Holy dynasty’s most powerful figures had come from the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>Back then, the nine absolute Heavenly King and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had both joined the great void Royal sacred Academy and cultivated there.</p><p>The great void Royal sacred Academy was the target of all the geniuses of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>“Alright, go back!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes waved his hand and the crowd dispersed.</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming had a divine power origin Pearl on him. Heavenly King Nine cuts had specially sent an expert to send Lu Ming back to the star sky Camp.</p><p>There were experts from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion guarding the universal camp, so he wasn’t afraid of being targeted.</p><p>After returning to the space Camp, Lu Ming immediately went into seclusion. He took out a large number of divine crystals and devoured them to recover his divine power.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s divine power was almost fully recovered, he received a voice transmission from LAN Shang.</p><p>“It seems that uncle LAN knows the result of this fight for the divine power Pearl!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then flew toward the residence of the blue merchant.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the LAN Shang’s courtyard, he did not see many Indigo spirits.</p><p>“Ling ‘er has been in closed-door cultivation to break through to the divine King realm. I’m sure she’ll be able to reach the divine King realm the next time she comes out!”</p><p>LAN Shang appeared and said with a smile.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>I heard that you’ve obtained a divine power Pearl and awakened your origin secret skill. Is that true? ”</p><p>LAN Shang looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>of course it’s true. With my talent, isn’t it normal for me to do this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shameless.</p><p>hahaha, that’s normal. Show me your origin secret skill!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and then circulated his ruler’s divine power. An ancient stone door appeared above his head, exuding an ancient and desolate aura.</p><p>the God’s Gate, the God’s Gate, hahaha, amazing, amazing. A seventh level heavenly deity was able to awaken the ‘God’s Gate’ without any external help. Your talent is even more amazing than Jing Yu’s!</p><p>LAN Shang laughed, his face full of joy.</p><p>The more talented Lu Ming was, the happier he would be.</p><p>“You flatter me, you flatter me!”</p><p>Although Lu Ming was modest, he could not hide the smugness on his face.</p><p>He felt that it was such a pity. If that stubborn girl LAN Ling saw this now, he wondered what kind of expression she would have.</p><p>although you’ve awakened the origin secret technique, you’ve mastered many kinds of divine power. The divine power origin Pearl is still very useful to you. You can use it to awaken the origin secret technique of other divine powers!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. However, he had other plans in mind.</p><p>With his cultivation, controlling one origin secret skill was already very difficult. No matter how many origin secret skills he awakened, it would be useless if he couldn’t use them.</p><p>He planned to give the divine power Pearl to Qiu Yue so that she could awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>Oh right, the reason why I’m looking for you this time is mainly because of the great void Royal sacred Academy!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“The great void Royal sacred Academy!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>LAN Shang had mentioned it to him before, and he had heard the nine absolutes Heavenly King mention it again. Now that LAN Shang had mentioned it again, it showed how much he valued the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
