A huge force landed on the Indigo Spirit’s body.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming controlled the power of the door of domination and did not use all his strength to suppress it. The power of the door of domination only caused the Indigo spirit to feel numb all over. It could not exert any strength and fell to the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and in a flash, he caught LAN Ling in his arms.</p><p>“What do you want to do? Let me go?”</p><p>LAN Ling shouted. Her eyes were filled with fear and tears were welling up in her eyes.</p><p>She really wanted to cry. She had finally broken through to the divine King realm and her strength had increased greatly. She thought that she could finally suppress Lu Ming and take revenge.</p><p>She did not expect that Lu Ming would awaken the origin secret skill and his strength would increase to an even more shocking level. She was completely vulnerable.</p><p>She felt wronged, helpless, and wanted to cry …</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming really restrained her?</p><p>“What do you want? Of course, I’m going to teach you a lesson …”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and then slapped a certain part of the Indigo spirit.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire purple bamboo forest.</p><p>In an instant, LAN Ling’s face and neck turned red, and her eyes were filled with shame and anger.</p><p>father, father, this pervert is bullying your daughter. Come and help me, father …</p><p>LAN Ling shouted and wanted LAN Shang to help her.</p><p>In the courtyard, LAN Shang sat cross-legged with a solemn expression. He kept muttering, ” I’m in seclusion, I can’t hear you, I’m in seclusion, I can’t hear you …</p><p>If LAN Ling were to see this, she would probably vomit blood.</p><p>In the purple bamboo forest, Lu Ming sneered. scream all you want. No one will care even if you scream your lungs out. Admit defeat and apologize. If you’re obedient to me in the future, I’ll let you off!</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>LAN Ling glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped her. LAN Ling’s delicate body trembled and her face turned red. She gritted her teeth and did not say a word.</p><p>Lu Ming gave her a few slaps but LAN Ling continued to glare at him. Lu Ming was speechless. This girl was really stubborn.</p><p>“That’s all for today. Remember, if there’s a next time, it won’t be this kind of lesson, hehehe!”</p><p>As he said that, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across LAN Ling a few times, causing her to tense up.</p><p>After that, he flung the Indigo spirit away. Lu Ming soared into the sky and quickly left.”Uncle LAN, Lu Ming will come to seek guidance another day …”</p><p>Lu Ming had already gone far away.</p><p>sigh, what’s Ling ‘er thinking? Lu Ming is so outstanding. Why doesn’t she like him? ” LAN Shang muttered. The next moment, LAN Ling rushed over angrily and glared at LAN Shang.</p><p>“Father, why didn’t you help me just now?”</p><p>LAN Ling asked.</p><p>“Ling ‘er, you also know that your father’s star core has been destroyed. He’s old and has poor hearing, so he can’t hear you!”</p><p>LAN Shang sighed.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>LAN Ling’s chest heaved in anger. Although LAN Shang’s star core had been destroyed, his soul power was shockingly strong. He could even suppress a peak Divine King expert. How could he say that he couldn’t hear?</p><p>“Is this still my father?”</p><p>LAN Ling wailed in her heart and could only leave while trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his residence at lightning speed.</p><p>However, as soon as he got close to his courtyard, he felt a vast aura permeating the air. At the same time, the divine Qi of heaven and earth was gathering madly in the courtyard like a bottomless pit, devouring the divine Qi of heaven and earth.</p><p>“I’ve broken through to the Godking realm. Qiu Yue has broken through to the Godking realm …”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>From the aura, he could easily tell that this aura came from Qiu Yue.</p><p>Moreover, she was trying to break through to the divine King realm and she was already at the final stage. Qiu Yue was almost done with her attempt.</p><p>Many people were watching from the other courtyards in the surroundings. They were all extremely surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with these people. He stepped into the courtyard and waited quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have to wait for long. In less than half a day, Qiu Yue’s aura was quickly retracted. Then, Qiu Yue’s door opened and she walked out.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you’ve broken through?”</p><p>As soon as Qiu Yue made her move, Lu Ming went up to her.</p><p>“Young master, I’ve broken through!”</p><p>Qiu Yue replied with a happy expression on her face.</p><p>She was not happy because she had become stronger. She was happy because she had become stronger and could help Lu Ming.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed with emotion.</p><p>Back then, when he had brought Qiu Yue from the chaotic astral River to the Kong Xuan sect, Qiu Yue’s cultivation had been much weaker than his.</p><p>However, since Qiu Yue had awakened the nine-orifice Saint heart, she had improved even faster than when she was on the starry sky battleship. Especially after she had obtained the inheritance of the divine eye Lord, her growth had been explosive.</p><p>Right now, Lu Ming was still hanging around at the seventh level celestial deity realm while Qiu Yue had already broken through to the divine King realm.</p><p>This speed would really scare people to death if it was spread out.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I have something good for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and took out the divine power origin Pearl.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to give the divine power source Pearl to Qiu Yue so that she could awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>“Young master, What is this?”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at the divine power Pearl curiously.</p><p>this is a divine power Pearl. It can help people awaken origin secret skills from the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Lu Ming explained the function of the divine power source Pearl.</p><p>it can help people awaken the origin secret skill. No need!</p><p>Qiu Yue rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You don’t need to?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. What did he mean?</p><p>because I’ve already awakened the origin secret skill!</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>“What? What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and was dumbfounded.</p><p>Qiu Yue had awakened the origin secret skill? no way!</p><p>He had broken through to the God King realm and even awakened the origin secret skill?</p><p>“Young master, look!”</p><p>let’s go! Qiu Yue circulated her ruler’s divine power, and her body began to glow with a purple-gold light. An ancient scimitar appeared above her head.</p><p>This scimitar also seemed to be made of stone. It was engraved with the marks of time and was filled with a strong and ancient aura.</p><p>the origin secret skill! It’s really the origin secret skill!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but widen his eyes.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had already awakened the ruler’s door and definitely wouldn’t be wrong. This was the origin secret skill.</p><p>Different people might awaken different origin secret skills from the same divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Those who did not control the God’s divine power would awaken origin secret techniques from the God’s Gate, or something else.</p><p>“This secret technique of mine is called the ‘ruler’s blade’!”</p><p>Qiu Yue explained.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing …”</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how to describe his feelings.</p><p>He had worked hard and narrowly escaped death. In the fierce battle, he had awakened the origin secret skill.</p><p>Qiu Yue, on the other hand, had not only reached the divine King realm but also awakened her origin secret skill.</p><p>Of course, the more powerful Qiu Yue was, the happier Lu Ming was.</p><p>“Young master, Qiuyue can help you now, right?” Qiu Yue was also very happy.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>With Qiu Yue’s current strength, he was probably no match for her.</p><p>&Nbsp; he controlled many types of divine power, and so did Qiu Yue. His strengths were the battle symbol art, the quantity symbol art, and the ancient God Body.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue had the God vanquishing light, and with her cultivation at the first level of the God King realm and the ruler’s blade, her combat power would definitely be terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
