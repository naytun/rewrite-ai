I believe you’ll be able to break through very soon. After you break through, we’ll return. I believe that family head will be greatly shocked.</p><p>An old man laughed.</p><p>alright, I’ll try my best to break through within three months!</p><p>Han Ying nodded, his eyes determined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, beams of black light shot over from the distance. After a few breaths, more than a dozen black-robed men appeared in the sky, surrounding Han Ying and the other two. Their bodies were filled with a cold aura.</p><p>Han Ying and the other two old men were shocked. Subconsciously, the two old men surrounded Han Ying to protect him.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Who are you people?”</p><p>An old man asked.</p><p>“You’re Han Ying, the third young lady of the Han family?”</p><p>One of the black-robed men looked at Han Ying and asked.</p><p>“Yes, I am Han Ying!”</p><p>Han Ying said.</p><p>“Hehehe, very good, I’ve finally found you!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men sneered, his voice icy.</p><p>“You guys were looking for me? What is it?”</p><p>Han Ying asked.</p><p>“I’m naturally looking for you to kill you!”</p><p>The black-robed man sneered.</p><p>Hearing this, Han Ying and the two elders of the Han family were shocked.</p><p>“Who are you people? Do you understand that we are from the Han family? if you dare to touch us, the Han family will not let you off!”</p><p>Han Ying shouted.</p><p>The Han clan was one of the overlords of the chutian star field. They were very powerful. In the chutian star field, very few people dared to not give the Han clan face, let alone kill the Han clan’s people.</p><p>“Hehehe, the Han family won’t let us go?”</p><p>The few black-robed men laughed sarcastically.</p><p>As if they wanted to see the despair of Han Ying and the others, the black-robed men did not attack immediately. One of them sneered, ” you guys probably don’t know yet, but your han family has been exterminated. Not a single chicken or dog was left in the Han family. The only core members of the Han family are you guys. Hehehe!</p><p>Han Ying and the other two old men were shocked by his words. They couldn’t believe what they had just heard.</p><p>“Impossible! You’re talking nonsense! You want to use this method to scare us? don’t even think about it! We won’t be fooled!”</p><p>Han Ying cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“You don’t believe me? Hehe, then I’ll make you give up completely. Take a look at what this is.”</p><p>A black-robed man took out a shadow breath stone. The shadow breath stone glowed, and a projection appeared in the air.</p><p>On the projection, it was the scene of the Han family being exterminated. One by one, the Han family members were killed and died on the spot.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Han Ying’s body trembled, and his face turned pale.</p><p>The two elders from the Han family were similar.</p><p>hehehe, do you feel very desperate and helpless …</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The black-robed men sneered. They felt very happy to see Han Ying and the others in despair.</p><p>They could have killed Han Ying and the others immediately, but they did not do so. They wanted to see Han Ying and the others despair.</p><p>These men of sacrifice had been strictly trained since they were young, and their lives were in the hands of others. They were somewhat abnormal.</p><p>you, why did you do this? why did you exterminate my han family? ”</p><p>An elder of the Han family roared.</p><p>because the Han family found out something you shouldn’t have!</p><p>One of the black-robed men sneered.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you all!”</p><p>arghh! Han Ying screamed and was about to pounce on the other party, but an elder of the Han family waved his hand and trapped Han Ying with his divine power.</p><p>miss, the Han family has been destroyed. You can’t die. You must escape!</p><p>An old man from the Han family called out.</p><p>that’s right. You’re the only descendant of the Han family. You can’t die. Even if we have to risk our lives, we have to save you. You can’t die!</p><p>The other old man also shouted.</p><p>“You still want to live? how naive. Alright, I’ll send you on your way now!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men’s voice turned cold, his killing intent chilling.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>At this moment, the two elders of the Han family, along with Han Ying, suddenly launched a fierce attack.</p><p>The two elders of the Han family were not weak. They were both third level Divine King realm experts. Their first attack was like lightning.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One of the black-robed men was careless and was sent flying by the two elders of the Han clan, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The remaining black-robed man shouted coldly, and a few terrifying saber lights shot towards Han Ying and the two elders of the Han family at lightning speed.</p><p>Among the black-robed men, there were two fourth level Godking realm existences. They were not a match for the two elders from the Han family.</p><p>The moment the black-robed man made his move, the elder from the Han family knew that they would not be able to stop him.</p><p>“You guys hurry up and leave, I’ll hold them back!”</p><p>One of the elders from the Han family roared and turned around abruptly. He pounced toward the black-robed man, his body emitting a dazzling radiance.</p><p>He was going to self-destruct his star core and die together.</p><p>“Grandpa Lu …”</p><p>Han Ying cried.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The old man roared loudly before his body suddenly exploded. The self-destruction of a third firmament Divine King was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, when he self-destructed, the black-robed men were already prepared.</p><p>They retreated at the same time as fast as lightning, avoiding the destructive force of the Han clan elder’s self-destruction, and some of them only suffered light injuries.</p><p>The remaining elder of the Han family flew forward at high speed with Han Ying.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>More than ten black-robed men shouted coldly and turned into black lights, chasing after Han Ying and Han Li.</p><p>The elder of the Han family was at the third level of Godking realm. With Han Ying by his side, he could not run fast at all. The black-robed man quickly closed the distance between them.</p><p>does the heavens want the Han family to be destroyed, not even leaving behind the last bloodline of the Han family? ”</p><p>The old man from the Han family was extremely furious.</p><p>He was not afraid of death, but he was afraid that he could not protect Han Ying.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up because he saw two figures rapidly approaching.</p><p>“He’s only at the third level of the divine King realm. There’s even a heavenly God Realm expert. What a pity …”</p><p>The expression of the old man from the Han family immediately darkened.</p><p>Naturally, he saw Lu Ming and Wu Shan. He had thought that Lu Ming was like Han Ying, out for training.</p><p>Only at the third level of King God Realm couldn’t help them at all.</p><p>“You two, leave quickly. It’s dangerous here!”</p><p>The elder of the Han family shouted loudly, reminding Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest were here for Han Ying. Why would they leave?</p><p>They continued to rush toward Han Ying and the elder of the Han family.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this time, the two strongest black-robed men had almost caught up with Han Ying and the other two. They slashed out with their blades, and a terrifying blade light slashed towards Han Ying at an amazing speed.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded them loudly. He was still some distance away from Han Ying and the other two. It was too late for him to help.</p><p>At the critical moment, the elder of the Han family suddenly pushed Han Ying away. He turned around and blocked the attack alone.</p><p>The elder from the Han family tried his best to slash out a sword beam. However, a third level Godking was far weaker than a fourth level Godking. The blade beam slashed down and the sword beam shattered. The elder from the Han family tried his best to Dodge but one of his arms was still chopped off.</p><p>The elder of the Han family retreated quickly, coughing up blood and his face was pale.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
