I inherited the divine eye Lord’s legacy. When I broke through to the divine Crystal Realm, it seemed like waves of experience about the secret technique of awakening the origin appeared in my mind. Then, I naturally awakened!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Qiu Yue had a nine-orifice Saint heart and was extremely talented.</p><p>Coupled with the experience of the divine eye Lord, it was normal for him to awaken the origin secret skill.</p><p>One should know that the divine eye heavenly Lord was a giant in the heavenly Palace. In the entire primeval universe, he was a peak expert and a domineering figure.</p><p>This was the benefit of obtaining the inheritance of a Supreme expert. No one else could compare.</p><p>young master, you should keep the divine power origin bead. You still have other divine powers that can be of use!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>alright, you’ve just made a breakthrough in your cultivation. You should also consolidate it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before they went back to their rooms.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his room and played with the divine power source Pearl in his hand. He pondered for a moment before putting it away.</p><p>He didn’t plan to use the divine power origin bead now.</p><p>Now, aside from using ruler’s divine power, he only needed to use the inextinguishable swordforce to awaken the origin divine power factor. If he used a divine power source Pearl to awaken the origin secret technique, he would only be able to awaken the origin secret technique of the inextinguishable swordforce.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use a sword but a spear. The origin secret skill of the inextinguishable sword force was not of much help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to use the divine power Pearl on the Overlord spear force after awakening the origin divine power factor in the ‘Overlord spear force’. This would be the greatest improvement for Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, there was a kind of ‘master’s door’ now. It was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>His cultivation was still low, but he could not even control one ‘master’s Gate’. If he awakened another origin secret skill, he would not be able to use his godly power that well.</p><p>He might as well keep the divine power source Pearl and use it later.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed.</p><p>my progress is too slow if I cultivate like this!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was not satisfied with the increase in his cultivation level.</p><p>Although the ” quantity ” formula was constantly refining the star core, he controlled ten types of Shen power. Even if he had the constant energy replenishment from the star core, his cultivation was still very slow.</p><p>there’s only one way to increase my cultivation quickly. I have to find a Supreme cold treasure to speed up the refinement of the star’s core!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>No matter what, cultivation was the foundation. As long as one’s cultivation increased, the power of other divine skills and secret skills would also become stronger.</p><p>The date of the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy was getting closer and closer. However, his cultivation was too low. He was only a seventh-level celestial deity. In the vast great void Holy dynasty, he was nothing.</p><p>He had to increase the speed of his cultivation. It would be best if he could break through to the eighth level celestial deity or even the ninth level celestial deity before the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy.</p><p>go and ask Zi Feng and the others where I can buy an ultimate cold treasure in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. At the thought of this, Lu Ming left the universal camp and secretly headed to the Wu family.</p><p>He arrived at the Wu family and met Wu Zifeng smoothly.</p><p>“You want to buy a Supreme cold treasure?”</p><p>After Wu Zifeng heard this, he frowned and thought carefully. After a moment, his eyes lit up and he said, ” brother Lu, if you want to buy a Supreme cold treasure, there’s an opportunity recently. In the Heavenly King District, the large-scale auction that happens once every 10000 years is about to begin. There might be a Supreme cold treasure at the auction!</p><p>“An auction?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>that’s right. This auction is held by the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It is only held once every 10000 years. At that time, there will be all kinds of treasures appearing. Naturally, there will be no lack of cold-type treasures!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“When will it be held?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you can stay at the Wu residence in ten days. We’ll go together then!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stayed at the Wu family’s residence.</p><p>Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This time, many people from the Wu family were heading to the Heavenly King zone, and there were many powerful beings among them. Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng were heading to the Heavenly King zone with the Wu family’s powerhouses.</p><p>The Heavenly King District was still bustling and lively.</p><p>They strolled around the Heavenly King District and headed for the auction when it started.</p><p>The auction house was huge, and there were at least hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>The Wu family was an aristocratic family, so they naturally had a special VIP room.</p><p>They then waited quietly in the VIP room.</p><p>Not long after, the auction officially began. The auctioneer got people to bring out the treasures one by one.</p><p>This auction was indeed worthy of being the largest auction in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. There were simply too many treasures, dazzling to the eye.</p><p>Many of the treasures made Lu Ming’s eyes burn with desire. Even though many high-level divine kings had participated in the bidding, Lu Ming could only stare helplessly at the prices.</p><p>After half a day, Lu Ming did not buy a single treasure.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming was not interested in low-level treasures. As for high-level treasures, a bunch of divine kings were competing for them and he could not interfere.</p><p>On the other hand, the Wu family’s experts made a few moves and bought a few decent treasures.</p><p>the next treasure is called the profound frost lotus seed. It’s a Supreme cold treasure. Those who want to buy a Supreme cold treasure, hurry up and make your move!</p><p>The auctioneer took out a Jade box. After opening it, there were dozens of lotus seeds inside.</p><p>“A total of thirty-six extreme frost lotus seeds. The starting price is three hundred and sixty thousand high grade God crystals, and each bid must not be lower than twenty thousand high grade God crystals. Let’s begin!”</p><p>The host called out.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, someone started to bid.</p><p>“Three hundred and eighty thousand high grade God crystals!”</p><p>“Four hundred thousand high grade God crystals!”</p><p>…….</p><p>The price continued to rise, and it soon reached five hundred thousand high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>“Thirty profound frost lotus seeds!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and were burning with passion.</p><p>He decided to buy it. It would definitely be of great use to him in refining the star core.</p><p>Fortunately, although the profound frost lotus seed was precious, it was not of much use to the high-level godkings. Therefore, there were no high-level godkings competing for it. It was not impossible for Lu Ming to buy it.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had killed quite a few powerful enemies in this period of time, and he had at least a few million high-quality divine crystals on him.</p><p>“Eight hundred thousand high grade God crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately raised the price to eight hundred thousand high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>The crowd fell silent. The bid had increased by so many high grade divine crystals, so it was clear that they were determined to win. Many people began to hesitate about whether or not to raise the bid.</p><p>“One million!”</p><p>After a while, one of them spoke.</p><p>“One million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely.</p><p>Then, the man fell silent.</p><p>The host asked a few questions, but no one made a bid. The mysterious frost lotus seed was successfully won by Lu Ming at a price of 1.2 million high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming paid the money and received thirty-six mysterious frost lotus seeds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
