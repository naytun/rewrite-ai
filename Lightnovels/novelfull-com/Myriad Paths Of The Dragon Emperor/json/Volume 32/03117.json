The remaining godkings of the cold dawn sect were stunned as well. Their eyes widened as they revealed an expression of extreme fear.</p><p>More than a dozen divine kings had died just like that. Lu Ming had killed them with a single move. They were the core strength of the cold dawn sect.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>After coming back to his senses, sun Nian shouted in fear and tried to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were too terrifying. He had killed more than ten divine kings with a single move. There were even a few third tier divine kings among them. Even a fourth tier Divine King would not be able to achieve such abilities.</p><p>He realized that Lu Ming was a demon that could not be provoked. He wanted to leave this place immediately and stay away from Lu Ming.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming would not give him the chance.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air. Endless lightning gathered in his palm before bursting out, blasting toward sun Nian and the remaining Godking experts of the cold dawn sect.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>stop! two elders roared and appeared in front of sun Nian. They exploded with a terrifying aura and shot out two beams of divine light, trying to block QiuQiu’s lightning.</p><p>The two old men were both fourth level Godking realm experts. They were also two of the three strongest experts in the cold dawn sect. They were both fourth level Godking realm existences along with the sect master.</p><p>This time, in order to completely occupy the Han family and obtain the Han family’s treasures, the cold dawn sect had sent out 90% of their experts.</p><p>However, with QiuQiu’s current strength, the two fourth level Divine King experts were completely unable to block QiuQiu’s attack.</p><p>A violent explosion sounded. The divine light shot out by the two elders was directly penetrated by the lightning. The lightning struck the two elders, and their bodies trembled as if they were having epilepsy. They retreated violently, and their bodies were burned. Although they were not dead, they were half-dead.</p><p>As for the other godkings of the cold dawn sect, they were directly reduced to ashes by the lightning.</p><p>&Nbsp; only sun Nian and the two dying fourth level Divine King realm elders were left.</p><p>Sun Nian’s face was pale as he stood in the air, as if he had been scared silly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared before sun Nian.</p><p>“Argh! Please don’t kill me …”</p><p>Sun Nian cried out in fear.</p><p>“I won’t kill you, because someone else is more qualified to kill you than I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he thrust his spear forward. The long spear pierced through sun Nian’s dantian and extinguished sun Nian’s divine fire.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stretched out his hand and threw sun Nian toward Han Ying.</p><p>“Han Ying, I’ll leave him to you!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming charged toward the two elders.</p><p>The two elders were killed by Lu Ming without being able to fight back.</p><p>“Han Ying, spare me, spare me!”</p><p>At this moment, sun Nian was screaming in pain.</p><p>“Blaspheming my against my han family, you deserve to die ten thousand times!”</p><p>Han Ying’s voice was extremely cold and filled with killing intent. He slashed out with his sword, beheading sun Nian.</p><p>As a result, all the experts from the cold dawn sect who had come to the Han family had been annihilated.</p><p>This time, the cold dawn sect had definitely suffered heavy losses. 90% of the sect’s experts had been killed in an instant, and their strength had been greatly reduced. It was estimated that it would not be long before they were annihilated by the other forces of the chutian star field.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the other two made a round in the Han family’s territory and chased away all the people who came here to seize the treasure.</p><p>Then, the three of them worked together and gathered the Han family members together. They dug a large pit and buried them, then built a large tomb.</p><p>Han Ying knelt in front of the Han family’s grave for seven days and seven nights before he got up.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, young master Lu Ming. Thank you, Han Ying!”</p><p>Han Ying bowed to Lu Ming to express his gratitude.</p><p>This time, without Lu Ming’s help, she really did not know what to do. She was at a loss.</p><p>“You’re welcome, miss Han Ying!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He sighed in his heart. Speaking of which, this matter started because of him. If he had not been searching for the nine absolute divine crystal, the Han family might not have been destroyed.</p><p>the Han family will not be destroyed just like that. In the future, I will definitely revive the Han family!</p><p>Han Ying’s eyes were firm.</p><p>“I believe you can do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and encouraged her.</p><p>After that, the three of them left and headed towards the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>After some time, they returned to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion safely.</p><p>To Lu Ming, this trip to chutian star field was a great success. He had completely solved the matter of the nine absolute divine crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming heard a piece of news the moment he returned to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The mastermind behind the nine absolute God crystal had been found. Heavenly King Nine absolute was furious and the sikong family was exterminated.</p><p>This matter shook the entire nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and everyone was discussing it.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. This was strength.</p><p>In the cultivation world, in the primeval universe, everything was based on strength.</p><p>Otherwise, he would be annihilated just like that. Even if sikong Nan’s sister was the nine absolutes Heavenly King’s Princess, it would be the same.</p><p>They returned to the Wu family directly and discussed the matter with Wu Zifeng, who also sighed.</p><p>After that, Han Ying stayed at the Wu family to cultivate while Lu Ming returned to the universal camp.</p><p>The days that followed were peaceful and Lu Ming focused on cultivation.</p><p>There were too many things that he needed to cultivate.</p><p>First, he got the ‘Overlord spear technique’ and ‘Wargod strike’ from Chu BA Xing.</p><p>After successfully cultivating the Overlord spear technique, he would be able to cultivate divine-grade divine power, the Overlord Spear’s power. This would greatly improve Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could put aside the cultivation of the Ares ‘strike for the time being. After all, he had not cultivated the three apocalyptic strikes to its peak.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also felt that he had touched the threshold of fivefold combat power for the battle character formula. As long as he worked hard to comprehend it, he would be able to control fivefold combat power sooner or later.</p><p>On top of that, Lu Ming did not want to give up on the yin-yang divine eyes. It was an extremely powerful secret skill. The deeper one’s understanding of it, the more powerful it would be.</p><p>The most important thing was the comprehension of Shen power itself.</p><p>Although the chief sovereign’s divine power had awakened the origin divine power factor, this was only the first awakening. There would be a second, third, and fourth awakening in the future …</p><p>Furthermore, some people with terrifying talent could even comprehend origin secret skills from the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Every origin secret skill was passed down from the original gods, and its power was far beyond the current secret skills.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had already awakened 99% of the inextinguishable sword force. If he advanced further, he would be able to awaken it completely. In that case, Lu Ming’s abilities would increase by another level.</p><p>However, all of these would consume a lot of Lu Ming’s energy.</p><p>Lu Ming informed Qiu Yue and entered deep seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to successfully cultivate the ‘Overlord spear technique’ first and control the Overlord Spear’s power before comprehending other things.</p><p>Lu Ming was already very familiar with cultivating the divine-grade mystical technique. It did not take long for him to comprehend the first level and cultivate a wisp of the Overlord Spear’s power.</p><p>Next, there was no need to continue comprehending. He only needed to slowly nourish and strengthen himself.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a scroll appeared.</p><p>This scroll was given to Lu Ming by LAN Shang. It contained LAN Shang’s comprehension of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>After Lu Ming opened it, he read it carefully.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
