Then, the Jin clan’s heaven’s favorite’s arm exploded.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the Jin clan screamed as he retreated. However, Xu Yan’s attack was even faster. The stone spear was like a bolt of lightning, piercing through the head of the heaven’s favorite and killing him on the spot.</p><p>Another first level Divine King genius of the Jin family was killed.</p><p>“Xu Yan, you’re courting death!”</p><p>The Golden Elephant roared and charged toward Xu Yan.</p><p>However, Xu Yan didn’t want to fight Jin Xiang head-on. He took a step forward, and like a cannonball, he charged toward the next Jin clan heaven’s favorite.</p><p>The Golden Elephant was furious and chased after him.</p><p>However, before Jin Xiang could catch up with Xu Yan, Xu Yan had already caught up with the elite of the Jin clan and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>After a few moves, another elite of the Jin clan was killed by Xu Yan.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Outside, the experts of the Jin family were roaring in anger. Their eyes were red and their hearts were aching.</p><p>Previously, when Jin Xiang killed the Xu clan’s heaven’s pride expert, they felt very happy. Now, their Jin clan’s heaven’s pride expert was killed. They finally understood what it meant to feel heartache.</p><p>“Hahaha, good kill, good kill, kill all these sons of b * tches!”</p><p>The Xu family expert laughed heartily.</p><p>He had finally gotten his revenge.</p><p>The laughter of the Xu family’s Masters hurt the Jin family’s Masters even more. They gritted their teeth and couldn’t wait to fight with the Xu family’s Masters.</p><p>Inside the formation, Xu Yan killed three people in a row. The other elites of the Jin clan scattered and finally escaped far away.</p><p>At this time, the Golden Elephant had also caught up with Xu Yan and launched a fierce attack.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Yan was extremely powerful. He brandished his stone spear and fought with the Golden Elephant.</p><p>Although Jin Xiang had reached the divine King realm earlier, he was only at the first level of the divine King realm, the same realm as Xu Yan. Xu Yan was not afraid of him. The two of them fought fiercely for dozens of moves, but there was no clear winner.</p><p>At this time, a rainbow light flashed in the distance. Someone had arrived.</p><p>The commotion of the battle here had finally attracted the attention of the other heaven’s favorites and they all rushed over.</p><p>And it wasn’t just one family’s heaven’s pride expert. There were several families ‘heaven’s pride experts, at least twenty of them.</p><p>Jin Xiang’s face immediately darkened.</p><p>He still had a divine power Pearl!</p><p>“Quick, the divine power origin bead is in Jin Xiang’s hands. It’s in his hands!”</p><p>Seeing the others arrive, Xu Yan shouted.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites all looked at Jin Xiang’s left hand.</p><p>Jin Xiang’s left hand had been holding the divine power Pearl.</p><p>“It really is a divine power origin bead!”</p><p>When the elites saw the divine power origin bead, their eyes burned with passion.</p><p>“The divine power Pearl is mine!”</p><p>“Jin Xiang, hand over the divine power origin bead!”</p><p>A few roars were heard, and at least a dozen heaven’s favorites pounced toward the Golden Elephant.</p><p>One of them had a terrifying aura.</p><p>This person was also a Godking who had awakened the origin divine power factor. He was on the same level as Jin Xiang and Xu Yan.</p><p>Jin Xiang’s expression turned ugly. If there wasn’t someone of this level, he wouldn’t be afraid. But with someone of this level and Xu Yan, he was no match for them.</p><p>Jin Xiang wanted to run away immediately, but Xu Yan was holding him back. The other elites had already arrived.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than a dozen attacks flew toward the Golden Elephant.</p><p>“Void severing hand, sever the void!”</p><p>attack! Jin Xiang shouted, and his body emitted a dazzling golden light. He exerted his strength to the extreme and continuously struck out Golden Palm prints.</p><p>However, no matter how hard Jin Xiang tried to resist, he was still no match. His attack was shattered, and his body trembled violently as he drifted backward. His face was pale, and a deep wound appeared on his chest.</p><p>Jin Xiang turned around and ran without thinking.</p><p>“Don’t let him get away!”</p><p>Xu Yan roared and was the first to chase after the Golden Elephant.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites followed suit and chased after the Golden Elephant.</p><p>Soon, they had chased for tens of thousands of miles. The Golden Elephant turned into a golden light and tried to escape, thinking of countermeasures in its mind.</p><p>But the next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>A group of people had appeared in the void in front of them.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people in this group, and most of them were carrying sabers. Obviously, they were all from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Jin Xiang had no choice but to hand over the divine power Pearl to save his life. However, when the Supreme talents of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion saw the divine power Pearl in Jin Xiang’s hand, they looked at each other and all stepped back, as if they were not going to participate.</p><p>Jin Xiang was extremely surprised, but he didn’t have time to think about it. He flew past them and continued to escape.</p><p>Xu Yan and the others gave chase.</p><p>“Hehe, just let them fight each other first!”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion sneered.</p><p>Outside the formation, Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘expression was ugly.</p><p>Obviously, the paragons of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion had been instructed by the nine sabers Heavenly King to not compete with the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They would first let them kill each other and intensify the conflicts between the major families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>jiudao, in order to achieve your goal, you gave away a divine power Pearl for free, allowing the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to produce a top heaven’s favorite. I wonder if you’ve lost or gained? ”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes coldly transmitted his voice to Heavenly King Nine sabers.</p><p>“I’ll give you a divine power Pearl for free? Jiujue, you’re really naïve. Do you really think that your people can take the divine power Pearl?”</p><p>The nine blade Heavenly King sneered, his voice filled with mockery.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes laughed coldly in response, but he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>Inside the formation, although Jin Xiang was not blocked by the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s heaven’s pride experts, he did not run far before he encountered other nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>He had been surrounded, and in the end, he had no choice but to throw out the divine power Pearl to save his life.</p><p>As a result, it naturally led to a chaotic battle.</p><p>No one could obtain the divine power origin bead in the end. As long as someone obtained the divine power origin bead, they would be attacked by others.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense, and more and more geniuses died in the battle.</p><p>Outside the formation, everyone could clearly see that many families were at daggers drawn.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the nine Arts Heavenly King suppressing the situation here, some of the aristocratic families would have already started a war.</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King’s face was full of smiles. Now, everything was going according to his plan. The conflicts between the various aristocratic families in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were indeed getting deeper and deeper.</p><p>“Also, that brat who ruined my plan, I wonder if he’s been killed?”</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King thought of Lu Ming again. He waved his hand and the scene in the sky suddenly changed from a chaotic battle to another scene.</p><p>There was only one person in the image, and that was Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered the formation, he flew around aimlessly. Unfortunately, he did not see the divine power origin bead after a long time. This made Lu Ming rather speechless.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming stopped in his tracks as a group of paragons blocked his way.</p><p>They were the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King residence. There were more than a dozen of them, and all of them were staring at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
