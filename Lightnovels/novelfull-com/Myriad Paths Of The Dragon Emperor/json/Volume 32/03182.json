This is a good opportunity for all of you!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The next day, LAN Shang brought Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling to the bone sword clan.</p><p>The bone sword clan was a powerful force in the great void Holy capital. They had a deep foundation, and their buildings were even more magnificent than the guangu family’s. Similarly, their strength was also far above the guangu family’s.</p><p>In front of them, there were many sword-like buildings that stood between heaven and earth. From a distance, it felt like there was a shocking sword Qi soaring into the sky.</p><p>Although the bone sword clan was no longer as glorious as they were in the past, they were still not comparable to any of the other powers in the great illusionary divine capital. They were still one of the top powers in the great illusionary divine capital.</p><p>“Those who are participating in the hunt for the sword bone may enter, but no one else is allowed to!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were stopped in front of a huge door.</p><p>“We’re here to hunt for the sword bones!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward.</p><p>“You guys can go in!”</p><p>The guard at the gate waved his hand. Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling walked in while LAN Shang waited outside.</p><p>Behind the door was a long corridor. After passing through the corridor, they arrived at a wide martial arts practice field.</p><p>There were already many people gathered here.</p><p>Not all of them were young, there were also many old and middle-aged people.</p><p>The bone sword clan’s rules only allowed those below the third level of Godking realm to enter, and there was no age limit.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and LAN Ling waited at the side.</p><p>aiyoyo, isn’t this the good-for-nothing who came to my house to ask for medicine? ”</p><p>At this moment, an inharmonious voice was heard.</p><p>Then, a few young men walked toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Guan gulang!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>One of the young men was Guan gulang.</p><p>“Brother Guan Gu, is this the disciple of the useless LAN Shang? the one who hasn’t even reached the God King realm and wanted to ask for Nirvana pills from the Guan family?”</p><p>On the side, another young man sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Hearing this, LAN Ling couldn’t bear to listen any longer and said angrily.</p><p>“Aiyoyo, did I say something wrong?”</p><p>Guan gulang pursed his lips and glanced at LAN Ling with a teasing look. His eyes then fell on Lu Ming and he sneered,”What’s wrong? You didn’t get the sky Nirvana pill from my guangu clan and now you want the bone sword clan and the saintly heaven Jade wall. Hahaha, with your half-step Divine King cultivation, I can guarantee that you won’t even know how you died!”</p><p>The commotion here attracted the attention of others, and many people looked over.</p><p>“A half-step Divine King is here to join in the fun? You’ve really been possessed!”</p><p>“Although the bone sword clan said that anyone below the third level of the Godking realm can enter, that place isn’t a joke. It’s dangerous. Isn’t a half-step Godking just seeking death by entering?”</p><p>“Others are not afraid of death, why should we care so much?”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he spat out a word indifferently.</p><p>Guan gulang’s face became serious and gloomy, he said,”Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>“Get lost, get as far away as you can!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually, as if he was chasing away an ant.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Guan gulang coldly shouted, his eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; a powerful energy exploded from his body, the energy of a second level Divine King.</p><p>At the same time, an ancient aura filled the air.</p><p>At the second level of the king God Realm, he had awakened the divine power factor.</p><p>brat, today I’ll destroy your star core and let you be like that cripple LAN Shang, struggling to survive!</p><p>Guan gulang coldly shouted.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>LAN Ling was furious. She unsheathed her long sword and turned it into a bright sword light, slashing towards Guan gulang.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Guan gulang took out a long and thin saber, which was extremely ugly.</p><p>However, the power was extraordinary. Guan gulang’s blade light hit LAN Ling’s sword light. LAN Ling’s sword light shook violently and then exploded. LAN Ling’s figure quickly retreated. Her face was pale and she almost vomited blood.</p><p>After years of cultivation, LAN Ling’s cultivation base had reached the peak of the first level of God King realm. However, her God Power factor had only awakened once. She was one level lower than Guan gulang, so she was no match for him.</p><p>“Kid, it’s your turn now!”</p><p>After Guan gulang defeated the Indigo spirit, he looked at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Young master, let me …”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to make a move, Qiu Yue stepped out and landed in front of him.</p><p>“Young master, let me handle this!”</p><p>Qiu Yue added with a determined look.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Young master?”</p><p>When he heard a beauty like Qiu Yue address Lu Ming as young master, Guan gulang’s eyes turned red with envy.</p><p>“Little girl, what’s so good about you following this trash? come and follow this young master. This young master guarantees that you’ll feel great …”</p><p>Guan gulang laughed evilly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>What greeted him was a snow-white Saber Light. Qiu Yue attacked directly. She waved her hand and a Saber Light was slashed at Guan gulang’s mouth.</p><p>Guan gulang was slightly surprised and quickly waved his saber to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two blade lights collided with each other, but the result was that Guan gulang’s body shook violently and he was forced to retreat. He almost lost his grip on the battle blade.</p><p>“Second level of King God Realm!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly, revealing a smile.</p><p>Qiu Yue had reached the second Sky of King God Realm, the same as Guan gulang.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue had cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture and controlled many types of divine-grade divine power.</p><p>At the same time, Qiu Yue also had the God-destroying light, which was a heaven-defying method. Her combat strength was not something that Guan gulang could compare with.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After pushing back Guan gulang with one move, Qiu Yue followed up and continued to attack.</p><p>“Quick, let’s attack together and cripple this b * tch!”</p><p>Guan gulang shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Beside Guan gulang, several other young men also made their moves.</p><p>The abilities of these youths were extremely powerful. They were obviously the geniuses of the great illusionary divine capital.</p><p>A total of four people joined forces and charged toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>“God-destroying light!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s heart moved, and a ray of God-destroying light appeared. It turned into a curved blade and swept in all directions.</p><p>Boom boom boom boom …</p><p>With four consecutive booms, the four young men, including Guan gulang, were sent flying like cannonballs. They coughed up blood and fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>“Such a beautiful woman with such a strong cultivation, where did she come from?”</p><p>the grand opening of the great void Royal sacred Academy is approaching. Geniuses from all over the world are gathering here. Now that the number of geniuses in the great void Holy capital has increased, there are indeed many hidden dragons!</p><p>that’s right. I saw quite a few heaven’s favorites from the Heavenly King Manor!</p><p>On the side, the others looked at Qiu Yue in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
