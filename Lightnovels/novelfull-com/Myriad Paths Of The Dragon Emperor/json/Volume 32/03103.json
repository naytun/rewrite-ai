When Lu Ming headed to the Qin heaven star system, Qiu Yue’s cultivation base was only at the ninth level heavenly deity realm.</p><p>Including the time taken to travel, it had only been a few years. This speed was too exaggerated.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>that’s right! Qiu Yue nodded. it’s mainly because I haven’t fully digested the inheritance I received last time. That’s why my cultivation has been improving so quickly!</p><p>“Good, good, good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He was naturally happy that Qiu Yue was progressing faster.</p><p>After chatting with Qiu Yue for a while, the two of them went to their respective rooms to cultivate.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming entered the room, it was hard for him to calm down. He was perplexed by the person behind the nine absolute divine crystal.</p><p>“Who is the person behind this? What’s your purpose?”</p><p>.com</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows in deep thought.</p><p>He had a feeling that the person behind the scenes instructed the dark ice Clan to steal the nine absolute divine crystal but didn’t take it away. His purpose was definitely not that simple.</p><p>“How can I find the person behind this?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The person behind the scenes had sent men of sacrifice to kill him time and time again. Lu Ming would not be at ease until he found the person behind the scenes.</p><p>Who knew if he would be assassinated by this group of people when he went out in the future? Lu Ming could not guarantee that he would be able to get out of danger every time.</p><p>“How can I find the person behind this? Are there any other clues that I’ve overlooked?”</p><p>Lu Ming calmed down and pondered quietly.</p><p>In his mind, many thoughts passed as he recalled the incident of the nine absolute God crystal being stolen.</p><p>“Wait …”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He realized that he had overlooked an important clue.</p><p>This clue was Magic City mountain.</p><p>On Mount modu, Lu Ming had heard more than once that Mount modu had a backer in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. That was why no forces dared to touch mo yequan. Otherwise, with the cultivation of the night Demon King, he could not protect mo yequan at all.</p><p>It was obvious that the backing of Shanghai mountain was the mastermind behind the nine absolute God crystal incident.</p><p>And there must be someone who knew who was the backer behind Magic City mountain, which was why they didn’t dare to make a move. If it was just hearsay, how could those forces resist the temptation of demon night spring?</p><p>In that case, as long as he asked the big forces who the backer behind Magic City mountain was, wouldn’t he be able to find the mastermind?</p><p>that’s right. I actually neglected such a simple matter!</p><p>Lu Ming clapped his hands and shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p>He had been so focused on the evidence left behind by the night Demon Lord that he had overlooked such a simple logical problem.</p><p>“Go and ask Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the universal camp discreetly, heading towards the Wu family.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the Wu residence and met Wu Zifeng.</p><p>In a courtyard, Lu Ming, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong were sitting at a round table.</p><p>During this period of time, Yue Linglong had been cultivating in the Wu family. Their cultivation base had progressed very quickly and they had both stepped into the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>Zi Feng, you should have heard that there is a backer behind Magic City mountain, right? I have been thinking about something. Since the other powers don’t dare to attack Magic City mountain, they must know who is behind it. As long as we find out who is behind it, we will be able to find the person behind the theft of the nine absolute godly crystal!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yeah, why didn’t I think of that!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng clapped his hands, his eyes bright.</p><p>“Does the woo family know who’s the backer behind Magic City mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“This … I’m afraid I don’t!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng shook his head.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>yes, it’s rumored that they have a backer behind them, so other forces don’t dare to have any ideas about them. Those forces don’t refer to the forces of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>although the demon night spring on Magic City mountain is precious, it is not in the eyes of the forces of nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, such as the Wu family, Jin family, Qin family, and so on. Although some people have heard of Magic City mountain, they don’t care about it at all. They are also too lazy to send people to deal with Magic City mountain. It is not because they are afraid of their so-called backer!</p><p>those powers that are afraid of the backing of Magic City mountain should be referring to the major powers of chutian star field!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>The chutian Starfield was close to the Qin Tian Starfield. It was also the border of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Powerful forces like the Wu clan and the Jin clan didn’t care about Magic City mountain at all.</p><p>Naturally, there was no such thing as being afraid.</p><p>Those who wanted to target Magic City mountain but were afraid of the mountain’s backer were only the forces from chutian star field.</p><p>It was like in the Qin heaven star system, if a small force had some kind of treasure, only the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the ice Soul Clan, or the Scarlet Flame clan would target him. For example, why would the Wu family or the Jin family care about the treasure of a small force?</p><p>then, as long as we find the powerful forces of chutian Starfield and know who they are afraid of, wouldn’t we know who the mastermind is? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up again.</p><p>that’s right. According to what I know, there are two strongest forces in chutian star field that dominate the entire star field. One is the wind moon sect, and the other is the ancient han family!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll make a trip to chutian star field!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>wait, brother Lu. I’ll find someone who’s familiar with chutian star field to accompany you. After all, chutian star field is too big!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and did not stand on ceremony.</p><p>Having someone to lead the way was better than him looking blindly alone.</p><p>Wu Zifeng took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message. Then, they chatted while waiting.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long before a middle-aged man came to the courtyard.</p><p>“Young master, why are you looking for me?”</p><p>The middle-aged man saluted Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“Wu Shan, it’s like this …”</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained the matter and said, ” “You and brother Lu go to chutian star field and Scout around!”</p><p>“Alright, young master!”</p><p>Wu Shan accepted the order and looked at Lu Ming.”Young master Lu, please!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s not delay any further. We’ll set off now!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then bade farewell to Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong and left the Wu family with Wu Shan.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to the universal camp. Instead, he left the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion with Wu Shan and took the teleportation array to rush to the chutian star field.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming learned that Wu Shan had a third tier Divine King cultivation base.</p><p>The two of them took the teleportation formation and finally arrived at chutian star field.</p><p>the two largest forces in chutian star field are wind moon sect and han clan. These two forces have never dared to touch Magic City mountain, and often purchase demon night spring from Magic City mountain. They definitely know who’s backing Magic City mountain. This place is closer to wind moon sect, so let’s go to the wind moon sect headquarters first!</p><p>Wu Shan suggested.</p><p>“Wu Shan, you’re more familiar with this place. You can lead the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
