He took a step forward, and a powerful aura pressed down on the young man in the gold robe.</p><p>The Golden-robed man’s expression changed as he retreated.</p><p>who? who said he wanted to challenge you? ”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth said in a flustered manner.</p><p>.com</p><p>“If you don’t want to challenge me, then why are you shouting and yelling? Are you looking to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned even colder and his eyes were like lightning. The young man in the gold robe shivered and could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>As if he had lost face, the young man in the Golden robe shouted, ” “Lu Ming, why are you so arrogant in front of us? If you’re so capable, go and be arrogant to the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>that’s right, Lu Ming. You’re hiding in the universal camp and not going out. You’re letting us suffer the wrath of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. Do you still have any shame? ”</p><p>Another youth with a scale between his brows shouted as well. With one look, one could tell that he was a member of the Qin clan.</p><p>the nine blades Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>What did this have to do with the nine blades Heavenly King mansion?</p><p>“Brother woo, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the other two young men at the side. These two young men were Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>“Brother Lu, it’s like this,”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue walked over and explained to Lu Ming.</p><p>It turned out that some time ago, Heavenly King Nine sabers of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion had brought a group of geniuses to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, saying that it was to promote communication between the geniuses of the younger generation.</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had been challenging people everywhere the moment they arrived at the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Recently, many paragons of the starry sky Camp had been challenged.</p><p>For a time, it could be said that a great battle was going on.</p><p>Although there were wins and losses on both sides, the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion basically cultivated the blade way, so their attack power was amazing. Therefore, in general, the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had the upper hand.</p><p>Moreover, some young men in the residence of Heavenly King Nine blades had challenged Lu Ming by name and wanted him to come out and face death.</p><p>However, during this period of time, Lu Ming had been focused on cultivation and was completely unaware of what was happening in the outside world.</p><p>The universal camp was an important place in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and outsiders were not allowed to enter. It was normal that Lu Ming did not know about it.</p><p>However, how could the Jin, Qin, and winged people’s families, who had great enmity with Lu Ming, let him off so easily?</p><p>Therefore, they personally brought people to Lu Ming’s residence, wanting to force Lu Ming out and let him face the challenge from the residence of the nine blades Heavenly King.</p><p>Lu Ming understood after listening to it.</p><p>Back in star-moon ancient city, Lu Ming had killed many geniuses of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. Although no one knew that he had killed young master sky Mantis, other than Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and a few others, Lu Ming had killed many geniuses.</p><p>However, many people knew that he had killed Chu baxing, so it was normal for a heaven’s favorite of the residence of Heavenly King Nine blades to challenge him.</p><p>Lu Ming, if you hide, the nine blades Heavenly King mansion will vent their anger on us. If you hide yourself, you’ll make us take the blame for you. How preposterous!</p><p>“That’s right, hurry up and accept the challenge!”</p><p>After the Jin and Qin family’s provocation, the others also started to shout.</p><p>The Jin clan, Qin clan, and winged man clan had incited many heaven’s favorites from other clans to come together.</p><p>Where are the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>He had been cultivating for more than 150 years, and his combat strength had increased greatly. He was just about to stretch his muscles and bones when the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion came at the right time.</p><p>Although he knew that the Jin family and the Qin family wanted to force him to fight with the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, what did he have to fear?</p><p>the heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion is in the Heavenly King area!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man of the Jin family couldn’t wait to shout.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was divided into many areas. The Heavenly King District was the core of the Heavenly King mansion, and it was also the most prosperous area of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“The king area?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said to Wu Ming and Wu Yue, ” brother Wu, let’s go beat up the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>“Brother Lu, you have to be careful. This time, many Divine King realm geniuses came from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>Wu Ming hurriedly reminded him. He was a little worried.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was almost invincible below the divine King realm, the divine King realm prodigies were too powerful. They were worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>“A Divine King genius? Just in time. Let’s go, haha …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled heroically and walked towards the exit of the universal camp.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength is amazing. He even killed Jin Yuan. I wonder how he’ll fare against the people from the residence of the nine blades Heavenly King.</p><p>“There’s a good show to watch!”</p><p>Some of the young men discussed animatedly as they followed Lu Ming from a distance like a long tail.</p><p>Lu Ming, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue walked at the front. After they left the universal camp, they turned into a few streaks of light and continued to head towards the Heavenly King zone.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the Heavenly King District.</p><p>From afar, one could see countless majestic buildings built on the ground.</p><p>At a glance, it was boundless, with no end in sight.</p><p>This was an extremely huge city, but it had no city walls.</p><p>Some of these buildings were built on the ground, while others were floating in the air. From afar, one could see living beings of different races flying around. It was a lively and bustling scene.</p><p>Where are the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and asked the young men from the Jin and Qin families.</p><p>“The west side of the battle area!”</p><p>The Jin family’s gold-robed young man said hurriedly. He could not wait for Lu Ming to arrive earlier.</p><p>“The west side of the battle area?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>It was his first time in the Heavenly King zone, so he didn’t know anything about the situation here.</p><p>the battle zone is a place for people to spar and fight in the Heavenly King zone. Lu Ming, come with us!</p><p>Wu Ming said, then flew forward.</p><p>They flew past countless buildings and soon arrived at an open space.</p><p>There were many fighting rings built on this open land. At this moment, two young men were fighting fiercely on the fighting ring in the middle.</p><p>The fighting ring was surrounded by people.</p><p>They flew over.</p><p>In the fighting ring, the two young men were both half-step divine kings. One of them was using a saber, and it was obvious that he was a genius from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The other used a long sword. The two exchanged dozens of moves, but neither could determine the winner. In the end, they both left the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After the two young men left the fighting ring, a spear light flashed and a young man in battle armor landed on the fighting ring. His aura was violent, and a spear light shot up from his body.</p><p>&Nbsp; a massive spear shadow appeared between heaven and earth, stirring up the air and exuding an ancient and desolate aura.</p><p>“Half-step Divine King, origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Someone said in a grave voice.</p><p>he’s a peerless prodigy from the nine blades Heavenly King’s residence’s war god clan. His name is Chu Batian. He’s a half-step Divine King and has awakened the origin divine power factor. He’s terrifyingly powerful. He’s the one who has been challenging Lu Ming!</p><p>Some people discussed softly.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
