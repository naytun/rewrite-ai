Their numbers were endless, and each and every one of them was extremely crazy.</p><p>No wonder LAN Feng and the others suffered heavy losses the last time they came in. If they didn’t make preparations, they really wouldn’t be able to take it.</p><p>However, things were different now.</p><p>When the black shadows collided with the flames, they melted like ice and snow, turning into black smoke and dissipating.</p><p>Their speed was extremely fast as they kept charging forward. After an hour, they finally made it past the hilly area.</p><p>After charging through the hilly area, the surrounding black shadows disappeared without a trace.</p><p>As for them, they did not suffer any losses at all.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief and continued to fly forward.</p><p>However, after flying for some distance, a swamp appeared in front of them.</p><p>The swamp was boundless and filled with the smell of decay. Even from a distance, one could smell the stench.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder in front reminded them, and they slowed down again, slowly flying toward the swamp.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>As soon as they entered the swamp, the swamp rolled and skeletons appeared.</p><p>One skeleton after another rushed out of the swamp, brandishing their weapons and charging at the crowd.</p><p>“Take out the formation plate!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder continued to command.</p><p>Everyone waved their hands, and array discs flew out.</p><p>However, the formation plate this time was different from the previous one. It didn’t emit flames this time, but lightning.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The array disks glowed, and the light rays converged to form a huge bolt of lightning.</p><p>Lightning streaked across the sky, bombarding the skeletons.</p><p>It was obvious that these skeletons were very afraid of lightning. After being struck by lightning, they scattered and fell into the swamp.</p><p>They rushed into the depths of the swamp, but skeletons kept rushing out of the swamp.</p><p>It wasn’t just the skeletons, there were also rotting corpses that charged out.</p><p>These zombies had a foul stench, but their auras were extremely oppressive and their strength was astonishing.</p><p>“A holy light formation plate!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder roared again.</p><p>“Buzz …”</p><p>More formation disks flew into the air. This time, the formation disks emitted holy light.</p><p>The milky-white holy light was like the sun, filling the air with infinite light.</p><p>The zombies emitted sizzling black smoke when they were hit by the Holy Light. After a while, they completely turned into black smoke and dissipated.</p><p>Lightning and holy light filled the air as countless skeletons and zombies were killed.</p><p>They rushed forward very quickly.</p><p>However, the swamp was full of danger, and there were many zombies and skeletons.</p><p>Furthermore, other than the zombies and skeletons, there were also other ghostly creatures.</p><p>Countless ghostly beings charged at them. Some of them broke through the attack of the array disc and attacked the crowd.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The surrounding experts also made their moves.</p><p>The experts that LAN Feng had brought this time included the LAN clan head and the nine absolute Heavenly King residence. They were all extremely powerful. All of them were at the fourth level of Godking realm and above, and many of them were high level godkings at the seventh level of Godking realm and above.</p><p>There were even quite a few divine Lord realm figures.</p><p>With so many experts attacking together, the ghostly beings that escaped were all killed.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of unpleasant and ear-piercing screams sounded. The swamp rolled and a terrifying aura burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A swamp exploded, and a huge figure appeared.</p><p>It was a strange bird that was as large as a mountain. However, its body was rotten and it gave off a strong stench.</p><p>Its eyes were blood red, and it screamed a few times before charging at the group.</p><p>“This aura … Peak Godking …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This aura was extremely terrifying. It was similar to the aura of the head of the Jin clan and the winged man clan. It was an existence at the peak of the God King realm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the giant bird appeared, another figure rushed out from another direction. It was a skeleton wearing battle armor.</p><p>The aura that burst out from the skeleton was also extremely terrifying. It was also an existence at the peak of the God King realm.</p><p>Two peak God King existences appeared all of a sudden and charged towards the crowd.</p><p>Some of the young heaven’s favorites turned pale.</p><p>Facing such an existence, they could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>However, LAN Feng’s expression was very calm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the forefront, the gray-robed old man made his move. He stepped forward and waved his palm.</p><p>A gray sword light slashed at the giant bird first.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The sword light slashed down, and the giant bird couldn’t even withstand a single blow. It was directly split in half, and its corpse fell into the swamp, splashing mud all over.</p><p>After killing the giant bird, the sword light changed its direction and slashed at the skeleton.</p><p>The skeleton was wearing armor and holding a saber. It slashed out a shocking Saber Light.</p><p>However, when the saber-light and the sword-light collided, they immediately collapsed. The sword-light slashed at the skeleton’s body, and the skeleton’s body shattered. Under the destructive power of the sword-light, it turned into a pile of powder.</p><p>The two peak Divine King existences were killed in an instant.</p><p>The might of a divine Lord was so terrifying!</p><p>“Is this the strength of a divine Lord? It’s so terrifying!”</p><p>Some of the young geniuses were stunned as it was their first time seeing a divine Lord in action.</p><p>A peak God King was already strong enough, but against a divine Lord, he was completely vulnerable.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation realm was, the greater the gap would be, especially the gap between major realms, which was like heaven and earth.</p><p>“One day, I must step into the divine Lord realm!”</p><p>Many Young heaven’s favorites clenched their fists and swore to enter the divine Lord realm.</p><p>However, most of them were destined to be disappointed.</p><p>How could the divine Lord realm be so easy to step into? even if many of these people had shocking talent, it was destined that the majority of people could only stay in the divine King realm.</p><p>Otherwise, there would not be so few divine Lords.</p><p>The various great worlds of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had been passed down for countless years. How many geniuses were born? but divine Lord realm figures were few and far between, extremely few.</p><p>“Let’s continue!</p><p>kill! the gray-robed elder ordered after killing the two peak God kings.</p><p>The group continued to charge forward, and after a period of time, they finally crossed the swamp.</p><p>However, the destination that LAN Feng wanted to go to was obviously not here. It was still very far away.</p><p>They continued to set off. Following that, they passed through a few more dangerous places. In one of the dangerous places, there was even a terrifying divine Lord ghost that appeared and fought with the divine Lords that LAN Feng brought.</p><p>That battle was earth-shattering.</p><p>However, there was more than one divine Lord that followed LAN Feng. In the end, two divine Lords joined forces and finally repelled that divine Lord realm ghost.</p><p>But in this battle, LAN Feng’s men finally suffered losses.</p><p>More than a dozen people had died in that battle.</p><p>This was already considered good. They were prepared this time.</p><p>The last time LAN Feng brought people in, they were unprepared and suffered heavy losses.</p><p>After passing through a few dangerous areas, they stopped in a vast area.</p><p>The region ahead was filled with thick black mist, blocking their vision.</p><p>According to LAN Feng, last time, they had stopped here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
