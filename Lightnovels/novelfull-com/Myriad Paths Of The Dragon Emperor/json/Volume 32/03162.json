QiuQiu immediately wriggled and turned into an armor that covered Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>When the ball enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body, more than ten metal rods came smashing at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>The power was shocking.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Bolts of lightning emanated from Lu Ming’s body and shot out in all directions.</p><p>The Thunderbolts hit the iron cudgel of the dark ape battle clan accurately. The bodies of the dark ape battle clan’s clansmen shook violently, and they were forced to step back.</p><p>However, no one was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. After all, he still wanted to subdue the underworld ape combat clan. If he killed them, it would be even more difficult to handle.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s a metallic lifeform!”</p><p>One of the dark ape battle clan members roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming forced back more than a dozen of the underworld ape combat clan members, he stepped forward and rushed toward a few of them. Boundless lightning condensed into a long spear that Lu Ming held.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear and charged at the few dark ape combat clan members.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Three of the underworld ape battle clan’s Warriors were struck by the lightning Spears. They trembled uncontrollably, and their hair stood on end before they fell to the ground.</p><p>“Use the ghost battle technique!”</p><p>One of the dark ape battle clan members roared. At the same time, his body rapidly swelled up, turning into a giant ape that was more than ten meters tall.</p><p>At the same time, the bodies of the other nether ape battle clan members also began to swell.</p><p>Some were four to five meters tall, some were seven to eight meters tall, and some were more than ten meters tall.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and charged over.</p><p>The nether ape war clan also brandished their iron rods and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides collided continuously, but QiuQiu was still stronger. It forced the dark ape battle clan members to retreat. Some of the weaker dark ape battle clan members trembled non-stop. Their hair stood on end, and their bodies emitted black smoke. They even emitted a burning smell as they fell to the ground.</p><p>Only a few third level Godking realm dark ape battle clansmen were able to block it with great difficulty. However, black smoke was still rising from their bodies.</p><p>“My combat strength has increased!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He discovered that the combat strength of these dark ape battle clan’s members had also increased when their bodies swelled up.</p><p>Of course, the extent of the increase was different.</p><p>Some of them improved by one point or a few times, some by two times, and the highest one by two point or a few times.</p><p>This secret technique was really similar to the battle formula.</p><p>“Tell me, why do you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and charged toward the few third level Divine King realm dark ape war clan members.</p><p>“I don’t need a reason to kill you!”</p><p>A dark ape battle clan warrior shouted. His eyes were cold.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t think that I don’t dare to kill you. If you don’t say anything, I’ll have to send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Who do you want to send to hell?”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the distance.</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This was also a nether ape battle clan member. It was more than two meters tall, and its muscles were bulging. It was extremely burly.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that the aura exuded by the nether ape combat clan was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Divine Lord realm!</p><p>He definitely wasn’t wrong. The aura of this nether ape battle clan was extremely similar to the God monarch realm experts he had encountered before. They were on the same level.</p><p>Furthermore, the eyes of this dark ape battle clan member were cold and sinister. It was clear that it harbored ill intentions.</p><p>“Great elder!”</p><p>When the other members of the dark ape battle clan saw this person, they all bowed respectfully.</p><p>This ape was the great elder of the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>“So you’re war ancestor shockfeather’s successor!”</p><p>The first elder of the dark ape battle clan glanced at Lu Ming and asked indifferently. He did not show any respect either.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>“Since you know that I’m Prince Jingyu’s successor, you still want to kill me. How dare you? are you trying to offend your superiors?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, you dare to offend your superior? He’s long dead, and it’s precisely because of him that our race has been forced to hole up in this damned place. As long as we kill you, we’ll be able to fight our way out of here. The universe is so vast, and we’ll be able to do whatever we want!”</p><p>The first elder of the dark ape battle clan laughed. He looked at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming was sweating profusely. The muscles on his body tensed up and he felt a great sense of danger.</p><p>All of a sudden, a ray of light shot out from the eyes of the first elder of the dark ape battle clan and he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming felt that the void around him had been completely locked. He could not move at all.</p><p>“I’m going to be killed by uncle LAN this time …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>Didn’t they say that as long as he took out the ‘battle’ symbol art and proved his identity as Jing Yu’s successor, the nether ape war clan would be obedient?</p><p>However, why did every member of the underworld ape battle clan want to kill him when they saw him?</p><p>The difference between reality and imagination was too great.</p><p>Just when Lu Ming thought that he was going to die, the space in front of him suddenly rippled. Then, a stone rod suddenly appeared and struck the divine light.</p><p>With a bang, the divine light dissipated.</p><p>Then, another dark ape combat clan appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This one was only about 1.8 meters tall and looked rather thin. Compared to the other members of the underworld ape battle clan, it was much scarier.</p><p>However, the expressions of the other members of the dark ape battle clan changed when they saw this dark ape battle clan member. They bowed and greeted,””This subordinate greets the clan leader ~”</p><p>This scrawny dark ape battle clan member was actually the chief of the dark ape battle clan.</p><p>“Chief!”</p><p>The Grand Elder of the dark ape battle clan didn’t bow, but his expression was a little unsightly.</p><p>“Yuan Cong, how dare you kill war ancestor Jingyu’s successor! You’re too bold!”</p><p>The patriarch of the dark ape battle clan snorted coldly. His face was dark, and a powerful aura spread out.</p><p>“Kill him and then kill our way out, what’s wrong?”</p><p>The Grand Elder of the dark ape battle clan coldly said.</p><p>of course not. My underworld ape battle clan swore an oath to be loyal to war ancestor Jingyu and his descendants. You swore the same oath back then. Have you forgotten? ”</p><p>The clan leader of the dark ape battle clan said.</p><p>The Grand Elder of the dark ape battle clan had a gloomy expression on his face. He didn’t say anything.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was a little confused.</p><p>The Grand Elder of the dark ape battle clan wanted to kill him, but the clan chief wanted to save him. It seemed that he wanted to be loyal to him.</p><p>At this moment, in the distant sky, many figures were rushing over.</p><p>All of them were from the dark ape battle clan. There were at least a few hundred of them, and each of them had a profound and powerful aura.</p><p>“There are so many experts. They’re all at least at the seventh level of Godking realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The other members of the underworld ape combat clan were all extremely powerful beings. Each of them could kill Lu Ming easily.</p><p>The speed of these dark ape battle clan members was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, they arrived nearby and stood in the air.</p><p>All the eyes of the underworld ape combat clan fell on Lu Ming. They were filled with curiosity.</p><p>“Little brother, you’re war ancestor Jingyu’s successor. Show us your ancient origin word!”</p><p>The clan leader of the dark ape battle clan said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and controlled the ‘battle formula’ again, causing it to appear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
