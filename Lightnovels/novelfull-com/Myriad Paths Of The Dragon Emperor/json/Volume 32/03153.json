This was the first time he had seen someone using the ancient God Body since he left the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>He was quite interested and wanted to see the power of other people’s ancient God bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cast the ‘door of domination’. Instead, he waved his long spear and charged forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two huge bodies were fighting.</p><p>The huge spear and the huge combat sword collided like planets colliding, making a terrifying sound and sending out strong Qi.</p><p>After a violent collision, a figure was knocked back. The person who was knocked back was naturally Lan Liu.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he only swayed a little.</p><p>After Lu Ming’s body swayed, he immediately stepped forward, brandished his long spear, and continued to attack Lan Liu.</p><p>LAN six roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely, but LAN six was still no match.</p><p>Although he had activated his ancient God Body, he was still no match for Lu Ming in his current state. He was suppressed and at a disadvantage.</p><p>With every collision, Blue Six had to take a few steps back.</p><p>LAN Feng’s face was particularly gloomy.</p><p>exploding stars! Exploding stars!</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming used the star explosion move continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two consecutive supernova attacks were unleashed, and the destructive power completely enveloped Lan Liu.</p><p>Blue Six let out a blood-curdling screech as he retreated. He only stopped after he had retreated tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>The yellow scales on his body were tattered, and there were wounds on them. Blood was flowing out.</p><p>Blood was constantly flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>Suddenly, LAN six’s body trembled, and his body shrank rapidly, returning to his original form.</p><p>Lan Liu was injured by Lu Ming and could no longer maintain his ancient God Body.</p><p>this is your strength. The LAN family of the great illusionary divine capital is only at this level!</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. He then swept his gun at Lan Liu’s legs.</p><p>Since Lan Liu wanted to cripple his legs, Lu Ming would cripple his legs.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>LAN Feng shouted. He finally could not help but make a move. A sword light burst out from his hand and swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Fast, so fast that it was unbelievable.</p><p>Before the sword radiance even reached him, the terrifying force had already made Lu Ming’s body tense up and he felt a sharp pain.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly swept his long spear horizontally, aiming at the sword gleam.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword-light slashed at Lu Ming’s spear, causing it to shake violently. Lu Ming felt a terrifying sword Qi rushing towards him, and his huge body was forced back.</p><p>He retreated tens of thousands of meters before he could stabilize himself. Lu Ming felt a sharp pain all over his body.</p><p>Sword wounds appeared on the surface of his body. His green scales were cut open, and blood kept flowing out.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>LAN Feng’s strength was beyond his imagination. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“Young master, are you alright?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was injured, Qiu Yue quickly flew to his side and asked with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Young master, I …”</p><p>LAN six came to LAN Feng’s side with an unsightly expression.</p><p>I don’t blame you. This person is a monster. It seems that I have to personally take action!</p><p>LAN Feng waved his hand and stepped out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When LAN Feng took a step forward, a violent aura soared into the sky and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that he was facing a vast ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming frantically circulated his divine power to resist. At the same time, Qiu Yue, who was beside him, shouted and a powerful aura rushed out. It merged with Lu Ming’s aura to resist the external pressure.</p><p>Even so, the two of them still retreated a few thousand meters.</p><p>“What a powerful cultivation base …” He’s at least at the third tier of the Godking realm and has the origin divine power factor. It’s definitely not his first awakening …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>&Nbsp; he could sense that LAN Feng’s cultivation was simply unfathomable. He was at least at the third level of the divine King realm, or perhaps even higher.</p><p>Also, the other party’s origin divine power factor had awakened at least twice.</p><p>The other party didn’t look very old, but he had reached such a terrifying level in all aspects.</p><p>Was this the talent of the great illusionary divine capital?</p><p>interesting, really interesting. I didn’t expect the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to have someone like you. How about this? you hand over the divine power origin bead and then swear on your life source that you will be loyal to me in the future. She will do the same, and today’s matter can be settled!</p><p>LAN Feng said that it was interesting, and finally, he turned his gaze to Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s strength had also exceeded his expectations. Furthermore, Qiu Yue was so beautiful, causing LAN Feng’s heart to burn with passion.</p><p>if you want to fight, then fight. As for other things, don’t even think about it!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He kept circulating his God’s divine power, planning to cast the door of God. At the same time, he kept triggering the battle character formula, trying to trigger the fivefold increase in combat power.</p><p>Even if he understood that even if he used all of these methods, he would still not be LAN Feng’s match, he still had to fight.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself if you want to fight me!”</p><p>LAN Feng’s face was gloomy, and the aura on his body became even more terrifying. It formed circles of pressure and spread out in all directions.</p><p>“So strong, so strong, too strong …”</p><p>Behind them, the paragons of the Jin family and the winged man family were also extremely frightened. They were shocked by LAN Feng’s aura.</p><p>“Are we going to do something?”</p><p>At the peak of Star Peak, a few elders were standing in the air and watching from a distance. The situation on Lu Ming’s side was within their sight.</p><p>These old men were the elders who were in charge of the universal camp.</p><p>“Care? How? The other party is the son of the clan leader of the LAN clan in the great void Holy capital. Many people in the LAN clan hold high positions in the great void Holy Empire. Even the Heavenly Kings have to give him face. What do we have to do?”</p><p>One of the elders said.</p><p>that’s true. With our status, we can’t do anything about it. Forget it, just pretend we didn’t see it!</p><p>it’s a pity for that Lu Ming. Sigh!</p><p>The few elders sighed.</p><p>If the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s people dared to touch Lu Ming here, they would immediately suppress them. However, LAN Feng came from the LAN family, so they could not do anything about it.</p><p>The strength of the entire LAN family clan was even more terrifying than the entire nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Looks like you’ve chosen to make a move?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had no intention of surrendering, LAN Feng’s eyes turned colder.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. So what if he could not win? It was just a battle.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming still had QiuQiu. They might be able to fight.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you!”</p><p>LAN Feng said coldly. He took a step forward and a beam of sword light soared into the sky, piercing through the clouds and then slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“QiuQiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. QiuQiu wriggled rapidly and transformed into a suit of armor, covering Lu Ming’s body. Bolts of lightning were emitted.</p><p>However, at this moment, a vast power came pressing down from the sky.</p><p>This force was many times stronger than LAN Feng’s strength. With a single press, LAN Feng’s sword light was shattered.</p><p>LAN Feng’s body trembled violently, and he retreated repeatedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
