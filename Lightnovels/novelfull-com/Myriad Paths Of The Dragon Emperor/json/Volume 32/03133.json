Dozens of attacks enveloped Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely grave.</p><p>ice chains, nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor, space-breaking …</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming cast all kinds of techniques. The ice chains and the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor protected his entire body. At the same time, he thrust his long spear madly. In an instant, dozens of spear gleams were shot out in all directions.</p><p>However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. His attack was crushed by four terrifying forces and exploded continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The four attacks pierced through Lu Ming’s defense and sent him flying, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Origin divine power factor …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered with a grave expression.</p><p>He discovered that the winged people’s family and the Qin family each had a top genius who had awakened the origin divine power factor and was at the first level of the Godking realm.</p><p>In addition to Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man, there were four of them.</p><p>There were actually four heaven’s favorites of this level. Lu Ming was no match for two of them, let alone four of them.</p><p>“It seems like it’s easier to awaken the divine power factor after I reach the divine King realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Updated by NovG○.co</p><p>He had continuously encountered existences who had awakened the divine power factor. He did not believe that these people had all awakened below the God King level.</p><p>The lower one’s cultivation base was, the harder it was to awaken the divine power factor. There were so many prodigies in the universal camp, but only a few could awaken it below the God King stage.</p><p>And now, Lu Ming had encountered four of them in such a short time.</p><p>Most of these people had awakened after breaking through to Godking.</p><p>After reaching the divine King level, one’s divine power would increase dramatically, and their understanding of divine power would also improve. Some geniuses who had awakened their half-step Divine King divine power at ninety-nine percent had a high chance of completely awakening their divine power after reaching the divine King level.</p><p>Duan Jiang and the red-robed young man’s eyes brightened when they discovered that the winged people’s family and the Qin family both had experts of this level.</p><p>“Brat, let’s see how you die. Kill!”</p><p>Duan Jiang roared and continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other heaven’s favorites also attacked.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and retreated rapidly. At the same time, he continuously triggered the battle character formula.</p><p>However, his luck wasn’t good. The battle formula’s fivefold increase in combat power had yet to be triggered successfully.</p><p>“You want to leave? Today, you will die!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the winged man race who had awakened the origin divine power gene shouted coldly. With a flap of his wings, his body seemed to have turned into a bolt of lightning as he burst out at an extremely shocking speed.</p><p>The divine power cultivated by the lightning winged human race and the awakened origin divine power factor were all related to lightning. Once it exploded, its speed was terrifying. With his cultivation of the first level of the divine King realm, he was even faster than Lu Ming.</p><p>After a few flashes, he caught up with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lightning cage!”</p><p>The youth from the winged ones family shouted coldly. He flapped his wings and endless lightning exploded, forming a cage that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and bombarded the lightning cage. However, the lightning cage only trembled and could not be broken in a short period of time.</p><p>The attacks from the others had also arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming could only focus on defense.</p><p>However, when faced with four paragons like Duan Jiang and the support of the other paragons, Lu Ming was in danger and was no match for them at all.</p><p>Although he tried his best to block it, he couldn’t completely block it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A terrifying fist force landed on Lu Ming’s body. This was the Qin clan’s Paragon’s seven injury fist, and its destructive power was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was sent flying and he crashed into the lightning cage, causing it to explode with a loud rumble. Blood spurted out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>This scene was seen by everyone outside the array.</p><p>“Hehe, this kid is finally going to be killed!”</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>The people from the Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family roared in their hearts. They felt extremely refreshed.</p><p>In the face of such a situation, they did not believe that Lu Ming could survive.</p><p>The nine sabers Heavenly King also sneered, he looked at the nine extremes Heavenly King and mocked, ” jiujue, it seems like your people are not United at all. Haha!</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine absolutes’s face was cold and he did not reply.</p><p>The Wu family and some people who were on good terms with Lu Ming were all worried.</p><p>such a talented genius is going to die today? ”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent had shocked most of the people. Now that they saw that Lu Ming was at risk of dying, many of them felt that it was a pity.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was indeed in a precarious situation.</p><p>After the first wave of attacks, the opponent immediately launched a second wave.</p><p>“Triggered, triggered, damn it …”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. Unfortunately, it was difficult to activate the fivefold increase in combat power of the battle character formula at this moment.</p><p>One of the reasons was that the probability of triggering the battle formula with five times the combat power was low. The other reason was that it was difficult for him to fully concentrate on triggering the battle formula when others were constantly attacking him, so the probability of triggering it would be even lower.</p><p>I can’t die! Supernova, supernova …</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His eyes were ferocious as he continuously cast the star explosion.</p><p>Now, he could only rely on himself to fight for the divine power origin bead. Naturally, he could not rely on external forces. Therefore, QiuQiu could not possibly follow Lu Ming in.</p><p>Lu Ming could only rely on himself.</p><p>The consecutive Star Blast could only withstand the other party for a short time. Lu Ming’s crisis had not been resolved.</p><p>“Heaven splitting blade!”</p><p>“Thunder slash!”</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>“Divine flame war blade!”</p><p>The four strongest heaven’s favorites unleashed their most powerful attacks and destroyed the destructive power of the supernova. They charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The divine power in his body circulated crazily, draining all the divine power. His condition was raised to the peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, in the face of danger, Lu Ming’s mind seemed to have a roar. At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly calmed down.</p><p>Lu Ming became extremely calm, as if he had fallen into an ethereal state.</p><p>The state of life and death!</p><p>In the face of death, Lu Ming once again touched this mysterious realm.</p><p>In this realm, Lu Ming suddenly had a new understanding of the various divine skills, secret skills, and various divine powers that he had cultivated.</p><p>This was especially true for chief sovereign divine power.</p><p>Under LAN Shang’s guidance, Lu Ming’s understanding of the ruler’s divine power was the deepest. He had already reached the peak of the first awakening.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have come into contact with something from the origin divine power factor of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>He seemed to have seen a door in the origin divine power factor of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>Yes, it was a door, an ancient stone door. It was extremely huge and exuded a vast pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense a terrifying power from the stone door.</p><p>He tried to get close to the stone door. Unexpectedly, he succeeded. He touched the edge of the stone door.</p><p>At this moment, he also had a feeling that he could borrow the power of this stone door.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion and Lu Ming’s mind cleared up. He had escaped from the state of life and death.</p><p>The attacks from all directions were coming at him.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming instinctively circulated his God’s divine power with all his might without thinking.</p><p>A stone door appeared above his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
