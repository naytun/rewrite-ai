Although Lu Ming was at a slight disadvantage, it would not be easy for the Zombie King to defeat him.</p><p>“My three apocalyptic strikes are about to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming had broken through to the eighth stage of the three apocalyptic strikes a long time ago but he had been stuck at the peak of the eighth stage.</p><p>Now, after the battle with the Zombie King, he finally felt that the three apocalyptic strikes were about to break through.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming would not use the door of domination. He would only use the three apocalyptic strikes to fight the Zombie King.</p><p>sky-breaking, moon-slashing, star-exploding …</p><p>Lu Ming took turns to use the three apocalyptic strikes, constantly exchanging blows with the Zombie King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, just as Lu Ming cast the ‘moon slashing’, an even brighter crescent-shaped spear gleam burst out and slashed at the Zombie King.</p><p>This time, the power of the moon-cutting move was clearly stronger than before.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes had broken through to the ninth level.</p><p>This was also the highest level of the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>After breaking through to the ninth level, the power of the three apocalyptic strikes had increased by another level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The crescent-shaped Spear’s radiance collided with the Zombie King’s sharp claws once again. This time, both Lu Ming and the Zombie King were forced to retreat. They were evenly matched.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>In other words, he didn’t need to rely on the gate of God to fight Yuan Yu.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile. He was satisfied with the breakthrough of the three apocalyptic strikes. It was time to kill the Zombie King.</p><p>“Come out of the door of domination!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The door of domination appeared above his head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The gate of domination shook and then suppressed the Zombie King.</p><p>The God’s Gate was extremely powerful and terrifying.</p><p>The Zombie King tried his best to resist, but he was still sent flying, smashing a huge mountain into pieces.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the door of domination to suppress the Zombie King.</p><p>The Zombie King rushed out of the rubble and faced the bombardment of the master’s door. The Zombie King’s body was blasted to the ground again.</p><p>The Zombie King didn’t have any room to fight back against the attack of the door of domination.</p><p>After more than ten consecutive attacks, the Zombie King couldn’t resist it even with its defensive power, and its body exploded.</p><p>Ninth level, passed!</p><p>A pitch-black Vortex appeared in front of him. It was obvious that this was the door to the tenth floor.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. He did not enter the vortex. Instead, he wanted to walk into the zombie cave.</p><p>The Zombie King’s lair hadn’t been plundered yet, so how could he leave so easily?</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming found another Yin building block in the Zombie King’s lair.</p><p>Moreover, the ultimate Yin Qi of this Yin building block was stronger than the previous two.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he cut the yin building block and let it be devoured by the quantity formula.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming walked out of the zombie cave and came to the door that led to the tenth level. This time, Lu Ming did not hesitate and stepped through the door.</p><p>He had passed the ninth level and the assessment. However, Lu Ming did not want it to end like this.</p><p>He wanted to keep going down. He wanted to see how many levels he could pass in the end.</p><p>The more levels he passed, the stronger his talent would be. Wouldn’t the dark ape battle clan be even more convinced and loyal to him?</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to obtain more ultimate Yin treasures.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the eighteen levels of hell were a treasure trove.</p><p>Starting from the seventh level, there were ultimate Yin treasures on every level. They were of great help to Lu Ming in refining the energy of the star core.</p><p>Moreover, the ghosts here were also very good training targets.</p><p>Through continuous killing, Lu Ming’s understanding of various divine skills, secret skills, and even various divine powers would be greatly improved.</p><p>Since he had plenty of time, the speed of cultivation here would definitely be much faster than when he returned to the universal camp.</p><p>He might as well cultivate here, killing two birds with one stone. Why did he have to go out?</p><p>Outside, a large number of experts of the dark ape battle clan were staring at the stone tower.</p><p>Suddenly, the ninth floor of the stone tower shone with a dazzling light.</p><p>After a breath, the light dimmed a little.</p><p>After the ghost king on each floor was killed, the light on the corresponding floor of the stone tower would flash a few times.</p><p>At this moment, the ninth level glowed brightly, causing the hearts of many of the dark ape battle clan members to race.</p><p>“He passed! He passed the ninth level!”</p><p>I didn’t expect it, I really didn’t expect it. He actually passed the ninth level. Miracle, it’s really a miracle!</p><p>good. An eighth level heavenly deity has passed the ninth level. He is a peerless genius and has the qualifications to become the new war ancestor of our underworld ape war clan!</p><p>“I have no objections to this person becoming the new war ancestor!”</p><p>The scene was in a clamor. All the members of the dark ape battle clan were discussing.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had passed the ninth level, almost all the members of the underworld ape combat clan agreed to let Lu Ming become the new war ancestor. Even the ape followers, who had strongly opposed it before, were smiling at this moment.</p><p>Yuan Huan was even more ecstatic.</p><p>as expected of someone chosen by war ancestor Jingyu. His talent is truly astonishing!</p><p>Yuan Huan sighed.</p><p>All the members of the underworld ape war clan were waiting for Lu Ming to come out and support him as the new war ancestor.</p><p>However, they waited and waited but Lu Ming did not come out.</p><p>“Why hasn’t the war ancestor come out yet?”</p><p>Someone was puzzled.</p><p>look! someone suddenly screamed. the tenth level is lit up! The war ancestor has gone to the tenth level!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The other dark ape battle clan members were shocked. They quickly looked toward the stone tower and saw that the tenth level of the stone tower was indeed shining.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming had already reached the tenth level.</p><p>he actually entered the tenth level. Does he want to challenge the deeper levels of hell? ”</p><p>amazing! As expected of the war ancestor!</p><p>Many nether apes couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>“Which level do you think the war ancestor can pass?”</p><p>it’s hard to say. I think the war ancestor can pass the eleventh level, but I don’t think he can pass the twelfth level!</p><p>not necessarily. After the ninth level, every level has a different difficulty. Perhaps the war ancestor can’t even pass the tenth level? ”</p><p>it’s very possible. There’s a huge difference between the 10th level and the first nine levels!</p><p>“Just wait and see!”</p><p>The remaining members of the nether ape war clan, including Yuan Huan and Yuan Cong, were extremely curious. They stared at the stone tower and were guessing which level Lu Ming could pass.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know that his appearance on the tenth floor would cause so many thoughts in the underworld ape war clan.</p><p>At this moment, he was curiously sizing up a ghost in front of him.</p><p>It was a Black Swordsman, a headless Black Swordsman.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the swordsman in black the moment he appeared on the tenth level.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword radiance surged and the black sword was unsheathed, slashing violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>Half-step Divine King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived at the tenth floor and the first ghost he encountered was a half-step Divine King. It was clear that the tenth floor was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and swept it horizontally, destroying the sword gleam of the swordsman in black.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
