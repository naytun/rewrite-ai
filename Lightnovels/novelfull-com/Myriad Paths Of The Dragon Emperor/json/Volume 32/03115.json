Every time he traveled, he had to spend a lot of time. If he could carve a teleportation array on his body, he would be able to travel many times faster.</p><p>However, they could only be envious. That was the symbol of the divine Lord realm. Only the incomparably dense divine power of the divine Lord realm could achieve it.</p><p>Not even a peak God King could do that.</p><p>Shaking his head, he threw this thought to the back of his head. Right now, he was still too far away from the divine Lord realm. It was better to take it one step at a time and slowly improve.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll find a place to rest!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This matter was finally resolved and the crisis was completely eliminated. Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief and felt relaxed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>.com</p><p>Wu Shan and Han Ying nodded. Then, their bodies flashed and they left.</p><p>On a desolate planet, Lu Ming and the rest landed. Then, they each consumed a divine pill and began to regulate their breathing and recover.</p><p>After a few days, they recovered to their peak state.</p><p>“Han Ying, what are your plans?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Han Ying.</p><p>“I want to return to the Han family first and bury the Han family members!”</p><p>Han Ying said. At this point, she revealed a sad expression.</p><p>we’ll go with you. After dealing with the Han family’s matters, you can come with us to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The entire han family had been exterminated, leaving Han Ying alone with no one to rely on. Even if he couldn’t enter the universal camp, it was still better to cultivate in the Wu family than to wander around alone.</p><p>thank you, young master Lu!</p><p>Han Ying bowed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, they headed towards the Han family.</p><p>After some time, they returned to the Han family.</p><p>The entire han family was annihilated, and no one survived.</p><p>When they returned, they discovered that there were many more people in the Han clan’s original territory.</p><p>Many people were flying in and out, scurrying back and forth.</p><p>“I was the one who found this storage ring. Get lost!”</p><p>“I came here first, you’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A few shouts came from a dilapidated Hall. Then, a few figures started to fight each other. Their energy spread in all directions, causing the already broken Hall to be destroyed even more quickly.</p><p>“These people … These people …”</p><p>Han Ying’s eyes turned red and filled with killing intent.</p><p>It was obvious that these people were fishing in troubled waters and taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>The Han clan was one of the two overlords of the chutian star field. Before they were destroyed, no one dared to lay their hands on them.</p><p>However, now that the Han clan had been exterminated, apart from some valuable treasures that had been taken away by the sikong clan, all the ordinary treasures had been left here. Naturally, this attracted a large number of people.</p><p>In the beginning, no one dared to make a move. However, after a period of time, seeing that nothing was amiss, the cultivators of the chutian star field swarmed over to snatch the Han clan’s treasures.</p><p>In fact, the clothes and weapons that some of the Han family members were wearing had been stripped off.</p><p>No wonder Han Ying had such an expression.</p><p>“You guys, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and suddenly shouted. His roar was like thunder, and the few people who were fighting could not help but stop.</p><p>“Where did this brat come from? are you trying to wipe your hands? Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>A middle-aged burly man cast a glance at Lu Ming and chided him in disdain.</p><p>I’ll give you one last chance. Put down your storage rings and scram. Otherwise, die!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a sullen face.</p><p>“Arrogant! I think you’ll die first!”</p><p>The burly man was getting impatient. He swung the battle-ax in his hand at Lu Ming.</p><p>The burly man’s cultivation base was not weak either. He was a half-step Divine King, but he was still far from Lu Ming’s level.</p><p>“I’ve given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it!”</p><p>I’ll go, ” Lu Ming said indifferently. He threw a punch, and a nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out and pounced.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The middle-aged man was torn apart by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon and died on the spot.</p><p>When the other people saw this scene, their faces turned pale with fear.</p><p>“I’ll leave, I’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>“I’m leaving too!”</p><p>The few of them threw down their storage rings and quickly fled.</p><p>“It seems like I have to get rid of these evildoers first before dealing with the Han family’s funeral Affairs!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, I’m counting on you!”</p><p>Han Ying sobbed, her eyes red. At this moment, she was angry and helpless.</p><p>“Don’t worry, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming, Wu Shan, and Han Ying made their way to the core area of the Han family.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly and thrust his spear forward. Rays of spear radiance shot out like meteors, killing five to six powerhouses who were taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>The remaining people were shocked and quickly fled.</p><p>The three of them killed their way in.</p><p>Along the way, they didn’t encounter any strong experts. The strongest one was at the second level of the king God Realm, which was easily dealt with by Wu Shan.</p><p>Very quickly, they arrived at the core area of the Han clan, which was also where the Han clan’s main house was.</p><p>This place used to be a boundless mountain range with dense divine Qi. It was a blessed land with many palaces built here.</p><p>But now, the mountain range had collapsed and the palace had been destroyed, leaving only ruins.</p><p>In the ruins, there were many corpses.</p><p>“Sixth Grandpa, eighth Grandpa …”</p><p>Han Ying burst into tears when he saw the bodies of the old men.</p><p>This was her family.</p><p>“Who are you people? Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>At that moment, a few figures flew out from the Han clan’s core area. There were middle-aged men and old men.</p><p>The few of them stared at Lu Ming and the rest with unfriendly eyes.”This place has already been reserved by my cold dawn sect. All of you should quickly get lost. Otherwise, only death awaits you. Do you understand?”</p><p>An old man coldly shouted.</p><p>“The cold dawn sect! You’re from the cold dawn sect!”</p><p>Han Ying shouted.</p><p>“You know we’re from the cold dawn sect, so get lost!”</p><p>The old man waved his hand.</p><p>“What kind of power is the cold dawn sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Han Ying.</p><p>the cold dawn sect is a powerful force in the chutian star field. In the past, it was only second to the Han clan and the wind moon sect. It has a good relationship with my han clan. I didn’t expect that they would come to take advantage of my han clan’s destruction. They really deserve to die!</p><p>Han Ying said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>It turned out that the cold dawn sect was a power second only to the Han clan and the wind moon sect in the chutian star field. No wonder they were so overbearing, occupying the Han clan’s core area and keeping others from approaching.</p><p>“I don’t care what sect you’re from. If you don’t want to die, get lost immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said.</p><p>“What? Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>The old man shouted. He was a little surprised. In the current chutian star field, there was actually someone who still dared to speak to him in such a manner after hearing about the cold dawn sect.</p><p>Simply looking for death!</p><p>“Brat, just based on your words, you’re dead. Kill!”</p><p>The old man shouted coldly, his palm flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This old man’s cultivation wasn’t weak. He was at the first level of the God King realm.</p><p>The palm wind whistled, and its power was not weak.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Next to Lu Ming, Wu Shan stepped forward and threw a punch.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
