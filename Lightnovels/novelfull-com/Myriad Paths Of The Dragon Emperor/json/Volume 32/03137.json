They were existences that had awakened the divine power origin factor. With so many of them working together, it was more than enough to defeat the white-robed youth.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The white-robed young man’s indifferent voice was heard. His eyes were like lightning as he unsheathed his saber. A vast saber radiance slashed towards the leader of the woo family.</p><p>The blade ray was solid like a real divine weapon. It was full of ancient aura and the divine power of the second awakening was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The Wu family’s leader’s expression changed drastically. He kept punching out with both fists. In the void, countless warhorses were condensed. The warhorses stepped in the air and rushed forward.</p><p>“Brother woo, I’m here to help you!”</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Next to the Wu family’s leader was the leader of the Wu family and Zhao Mo.</p><p>The two of them attacked at the same time. A total of three attacks were launched at the white-robed young man.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The dazzling saber radiance slashed down and collided with the attacks of the three people, causing terrifying explosions.</p><p>However, even though it was three against one, Zhao Mo and the other two were still at a disadvantage. Their attacks were constantly being crushed by the blade light.</p><p>In the end, the three of them retreated, their faces pale.</p><p>The three of them were extremely shocked.</p><p>The second awakening of Shen power was truly shocking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The white-robed young man took a step forward, and a blade light appeared under his feet. A terrifying blade light burst out, its power like a storm.</p><p>The expressions of Zhao Mo and the other two changed again.</p><p>let’s attack together. There are so many of us. I don’t believe we can’t beat him!</p><p>The leader of the woo family shouted.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The leaders of the other families spoke and exploded with powerful auras. They approached the Wu family’s leader and Zhao Mo, planning to fight the white-robed youth together.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you think we’re just decorations?”</p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice was heard from the other side. Then, a sharp aura rushed out and locked onto the woo family’s leader and the others.</p><p>It was the other heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. They also made their move. They stepped out and charged toward the Wu family’s leader, Zhao Mo, and the others.</p><p>Zhao Mo and the others ‘expressions changed. There were many heaven’s favorites of the same level as them in the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. With these people and the white-robed young man interfering, they would lose without question.</p><p>For a time, Zhao Mo and the others stood still, not daring to make a move.</p><p>“Hand over the divine power origin bead!”</p><p>The white-robed youth no longer paid attention to Zhao Mo and the others, and his gaze once again fell on the leading figure of the winged people’s family.</p><p>“Here you go!”</p><p>The leader of the winged clan gritted his teeth. Although he was unwilling, he still threw the divine power Pearl at the white-robed youth.</p><p>The white-robed youth waved his hand and grabbed the divine power Pearl.</p><p>Many burning eyes stared at the divine power Pearl in the white-robed youth’s hand. Although they desired it, no one made a move.</p><p>For a moment, the scene was completely silent. No one made a move, and no one fought over it. Time passed slowly.</p><p>Although the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion desired the divine power source Pearl, they knew that they would be powerless to fight for it if it fell into the hands of an expert like the white-robed youth.</p><p>Soon, there were only two hours left before the one-month deadline.</p><p>Everyone thought that the divine power origin bead battle would come to an end.</p><p>it’s a pity that the brat who ruined my plan was not killed. Hmph, I’ll find an opportunity in the future to kill that brat!</p><p>Outside the formation, Heavenly King Nine blades snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p>This time, his plan could be said to have succeeded. The only flaw was that he did not kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>In the next moment, the nine saber Heavenly King was slightly stunned, and his expression was strange.</p><p>This was because there were a few more figures in the image in the sky.</p><p>Not far away, a few figures were flying towards the white-robed young man.</p><p>Among the few figures, one of them was Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, it’s almost time. This brat actually ran over to court death!</p><p>The nine saber Heavenly King’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>However, Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘heart sank.</p><p>It was too dangerous for Lu Ming to run over at this time. If the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion wanted to kill him, he could not run away at all, especially with the white-robed young man present.</p><p>As for the Masters of the Jin, winged man, and Qin families, their eyes flickered with killing intent when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>In the array, many people had noticed Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s this kid!”</p><p>The eyes of many paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion flashed, and killing intent emerged.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Jin Xiang, the leader of the Qin family, had a murderous look in his eyes.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The woo family’s leaders and some geniuses were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance now was extremely disadvantageous to him.</p><p>Many cold gazes fell on Lu Ming, but he did not seem to notice them. The few youths who came with him stopped in their tracks and did not dare to move forward, but Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>it’s really lively here. Everyone who should be here is here!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, his gaze fell on the white-robed young man’s hand. To be more precise, it fell on the divine power origin bead in his hand.</p><p>“Divine power origin bead, I’ve come at the right time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>it’s this kid. We’re in luck. It’s almost over, but this kid still came to our door. Let’s kill him and ask the Heavenly King for credit!</p><p>“That’s right, haha!”</p><p>Some of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s elites wanted to make a move, but someone was faster than them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve finally found you. Today, you’re dead for sure!”</p><p>The Golden Elephant roared in anger. Its entire body shone with golden light, like a golden sun, and it rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Jin Xing and Jin Yuan, two of the four heroes of the Jin family, had died at Lu Ming’s hands. The master of the Jin family had long given the order to kill Lu Ming at all costs.</p><p>When the Golden Elephant saw Lu Ming, it naturally attacked without hesitation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden Elephant wielded the void-breaking sword. The golden sword radiance cut through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, Lu Ming transformed into a green-armored ancient God. He whipped out his spear and hit the golden sword radiance.</p><p>The golden sword light suddenly shook violently, and Jin Xiang’s body trembled. He was pushed back tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The Golden Elephant stared at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>In the collision just now, he felt that Lu Ming’s strength was simply unbelievably profound.</p><p>A celestial God was actually this powerful, far beyond his expectations.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Not far away, the white-robed young man’s eyes also narrowed.</p><p>He had always been very proud of his talent, but Lu Ming was only a heavenly God and yet he had such strength. It was obvious that Lu Ming was more talented than him. In his heart, a strong killing intent was instantly born.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, two figures appeared beside Jin Xiang.</p><p>One of them was the leader of the Qin family, while the other was the leader of the winged ones ‘family.</p><p>Although the leader of the winged ones ‘family had been injured by the white-robed young man’s saber, it was not fatal and he still had the strength to fight.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
