Who could compete with him for the divine power Pearl?</p><p>It was no wonder that the paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion did not interfere in the fight for the divine power source Pearl and let the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion kill each other. In the end, the divine power source Pearl would still fall into the hands of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s people.</p><p>They were like a group of clowns who were being thrown around.</p><p>Many people were furious.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll attack with you. No matter who gets the divine power origin Pearl, it can’t fall into the hands of the residence of the nine blades Heavenly King!</p><p>The leader of the woo family shouted.</p><p>Zhao Mo and the other leaders of the clan followed suit.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After that, a few young men stepped out and walked side by side with Lu Ming. Their bodies were filled with a powerful aura.</p><p>“Alright, let’s work together!”</p><p>These youths spoke one after another. They were all leaders of the other aristocratic families.</p><p>These people were different from Jin Xiang and the rest. They had no grudges against Lu Ming. At this moment, they were persuaded by Lu Ming and planned to join forces.</p><p>“However, that person is extremely strong. Are you confident?”</p><p>A young man asked Lu Ming. The person he was referring to was naturally the young man in the White robe.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked toward the white-robed young man.</p><p>Zhao Mo, the Wu family’s leader, and the others stood in front of the nine blades Heavenly King residence’s elites, preventing them from interfering with Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s attention was on him.</p><p>The young talents inside the formation and all the experts outside the formation focused their attention on Lu Ming and the white-robed young man.</p><p>The white-robed young man was surprised to see Lu Ming walking toward him.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to challenge him alone.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The white-robed young man said. The blade light on his body flickered and his aura was oppressive.</p><p>“It won’t be interesting later!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity, having strength like yours is rarely seen in the world. But you’re inflated to the point that you think you can contend with me. You’re overconfident!</p><p>The white-robed youth said.</p><p>“We’ll know after the battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was very simple.</p><p>“Very good. Remember, the one who defeated you is Yuan Yu.”</p><p>After speaking, the white-robed youth waved his hand, causing the divine power Pearl to fly into the air and hover there.</p><p>However, no one dared to fight for it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After Yuan Yu threw out the divine power Pearl, a shocking aura exploded from his body.</p><p>A transparent blade shadow burst out from Yuan Yu’s body and shot into the sky, piercing through the depths of the firmament.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight. His body, which was hundreds of meters tall, was filled with divine power and a dazzling radiance.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars reverberated as nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>A total of twenty gigantic nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared at the same time. It was a shocking scene.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and took a step forward. Twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced on Yuan Yu.</p><p>Then, nine ice chains flew out and tried to bind Yuan Yu.</p><p>“Small tricks, break for me!”</p><p>die! Yuan Yu shouted coldly as he unsheathed his saber and slashed out.</p><p>The shadow of the saber above his head merged with the saber in his hand and slashed out a saber ray that was tens of thousands of miles long.</p><p>As the saber ray slashed down, it was as if the entire heaven and earth had been split open. The saber ray brought with it an endless wave of energy that swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The endless waves of force hit the nine-clawed divine Dragons. The nine-clawed divine Dragons shook violently and exploded one after another.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of terrifying explosions reverberated in the air. The twenty nine-clawed divine Dragons crumbled in a breath’s time.</p><p>Then, it was the ice chain.</p><p>Even with the hardness of the ice chains, it was difficult for them to withstand the power of the yuan Yu saber flare. After blocking it for a while, they all exploded.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming exerted all his strength and cast the ‘star explosion’.</p><p>A spear Ray as big as a mountain hit the saber ray.</p><p>As soon as the spear radiance hit the saber radiance, it exploded and turned into an endless destructive power that swept out.</p><p>However, the destructive power was immediately offset as the saber Light slashed down.</p><p>A majestic force rushed toward Lu Ming. His body trembled violently and he was forced to retreat a thousand miles. His qi and blood churned and a trace of blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming was injured.</p><p>The paragons from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion all looked worried.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for Yuan Yu. If Yuan Yu defeated Lu Ming, they could only run away.</p><p>he’s overestimating himself. He’s dreaming if he thinks he can fight Yuan Yu!</p><p>Duan Jiang sneered in disdain.</p><p>Outside the formation, the nine saber Heavenly King also revealed a smile.</p><p>what a powerful force. Is this the second awakening of the origin divine power factor? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The second awakening of the origin divine power factor made his divine power even more terrifying and powerful.</p><p>This kind of divine power, even if he did not use any divine skills or secret techniques, just the divine power alone was extremely powerful. Its destructive power was shocking and could destroy everything.</p><p>Just now, the elementalist’s slash had directly broken through Lu Ming’s various techniques. It was overbearing.</p><p>if you only have this bit of strength, then go to hell! Space blade!</p><p>die! Yuan Yu shouted coldly. He held his saber with both hands and slashed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A silver-white Saber Light was boundlessly terrifying. It slashed at Lu Ming at an unparalleled speed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if the space around him was being compressed. Even if he wanted to Dodge, his speed would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Facing this blade, he could only take it head-on.</p><p>“Let’s try the power of the door of domination!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>&Nbsp; he didn’t want to expose the door of domination, but it was clear that if he didn’t use it now, he wasn’t a match for the other party.</p><p>“Come out of the door of domination!”</p><p>open! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. He circulated his divine energy and an ancient stone door appeared above his head.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s ‘door of domination’ was already quite mature. The ‘door of domination’ was very solid, like an ancient door that had crossed through time and space.</p><p>&Nbsp; as soon as the God’s Gate appeared, it began to exude astonishing ripples.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the door of domination flew out. It was hundreds of thousands of feet tall and emitted a purple-gold radiance. It crashed toward Yuan Yu’s blade light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the silver-white blade light slashed at the ‘ruler’s door’.</p><p>The two of them shook violently, creating endless waves of energy that swept in all directions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the silver-white blade light shattered, and the ‘master’s door’ was also sent flying.</p><p>“You … How is that possible?”</p><p>Yuan Yu roared in shock.</p><p>He had used almost all of his strength in that move just now. He had wanted to kill Lu Ming with one move, but he did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to block it and Lu Ming was completely fine.</p><p>He was not the only one. The others who saw this scene were all dumbfounded.</p><p>“It turns out that Lu Ming still has a trump card!”</p><p>Many people murmured, and even more people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had so many means that it was shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
