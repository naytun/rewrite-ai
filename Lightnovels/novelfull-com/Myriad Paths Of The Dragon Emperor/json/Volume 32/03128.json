It won’t be easy to break through it. How about this? we’ll work together to kill the Tiger puppet first, and then we’ll fight for the divine power Pearl. What do you think? ”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the Jin clan suggested.</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>One of the sun family’s elites nodded.</p><p>Then, the Jin family and the sun family both looked at the Xu family.</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>In the end, the Xu family’s Paragon also agreed.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s attack together!”</p><p>Jin clan’s chosen nodded. His entire body glowed as he launched an attack towards the ferocious Tiger puppet.</p><p>Then, the paragons of the Xu family and the sun family made their moves.</p><p>The three forces had more than ten experts in total. There were eight or nine King God Realm experts. They were all very powerful.</p><p>With so many experts attacking together, the ferocious Tiger puppet was completely no match for them and was suppressed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground beneath the Tiger puppet continued to crack and crack. The Tiger puppet was embedded in the ground, unable to move.</p><p>With so many people attacking at the same time, even though the ferocious Tiger puppet’s defense was strong, it could not withstand it.</p><p>After being struck several times, the Tiger puppet finally couldn’t take it anymore, and cracks appeared on its body.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up, and they began to bombard with more effort.</p><p>Of course, everyone was on guard against each other, afraid that others would suddenly attack.</p><p>Kachaa! Kacha ~!</p><p>The sounds of porcelain shattering grew in number. Dense cracks appeared on the Tiger puppet’s body, and it finally exploded with a bang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tiger puppet exploded, but the divine power origin Pearl was not damaged at all. It turned into a ray of light and rushed out.</p><p>“The divine power Pearl is mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes immediately burned with desire as they charged toward the divine power Pearl.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“I’ve been on guard against you!”</p><p>Roars of anger could be heard as the paragons of the three families started a chaotic battle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure charged at the divine power origin bead.</p><p>He was a genius of the Xu family.</p><p>This person was covered in a thick rock armor. He didn’t care about his injuries and dashed toward the divine power Pearl.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the Jin and sun families coldly shouted as they attacked.</p><p>However, this heaven’s favorite of the Xu family had an amazing defense. Many attacks hit his rock armor, making clanking sounds and sending sparks in all directions.</p><p>Of course, no matter how strong the Xu clan’s Paragon’s defense was, he could not withstand so many attacks.</p><p>However, he only needed to defend for a while. When the rock armor on his body exploded, he had already rushed to the divine power Pearl and grabbed it.</p><p>“Catch!”</p><p>The elite of the Xu family waved his hand, and the divine power origin bead flew toward another elite of the Xu family like a rainbow.</p><p>The elite of the Xu family caught the divine power origin bead and ran away.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The elites of the Jin and sun families chased after the elite of the Xu family like crazy.</p><p>The young man from the Xu family who had just taken the divine power Pearl spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.</p><p>The other two half-step Divine King geniuses of the Xu family quickly flew over and caught him.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>One of them asked.</p><p>I’m fine. I hope Xu Kuang can escape!</p><p>The Xu clan’s elite from before said.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, a golden light burst down from the front with an astonishing momentum. It was aimed at the Xu family’s elite, Xu Kuang, who had obtained the divine power Pearl.</p><p>Xu Kuang was shocked and quickly blocked it.</p><p>A layer of rock armor also appeared on his body and wrapped around him.</p><p>The Xu family was better at defense.</p><p>However, when the golden sword light came down, Xu Kuang’s rock armor was as fragile as tofu.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Xu Kuang’s body was cut in half, and he died on the spot.</p><p>A first level Divine King was killed in an instant.</p><p>Then, a figure appeared next to Xu Kuang’s body. With a wave of his hand, he grabbed the divine power Pearl.</p><p>“Golden Elephant!”</p><p>“It’s the Golden Elephant, damn it!”</p><p>Whether it was the remaining members of the Xu family or the elites of the sun family, all of them exclaimed in shock, and their expressions became extremely serious.</p><p>Jin Xiang was one of the four young talents of the Jin clan. He was at the first tier of the Godking realm and had also awakened the divine power factor. His strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Such a person could be said to be at the top of the pyramid in this fight for the divine power origin bead.</p><p>“Jin clan, damn it …”</p><p>Outside, the Xu family’s experts were roaring in anger.</p><p>The Xu family had lost another genius.</p><p>This was a genius of the divine King realm. Those who could break through to the divine King realm at such a young age were all rare geniuses. There were only a few of them in every family.</p><p>These heaven’s favorites were the future pillars of the big families. But now, two of them were already dead. They were both killed by Jin family.</p><p>It would be strange if the experts of the Xu family were not angry.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>The experts of the Jin family laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>Now that the divine power source Pearl had fallen into the hands of Jin Xiang, who could take it away?</p><p>With Jin Xiang’s strength, as long as he hid the divine power Pearl well and found a place to hide, it would be too easy for him to survive a month.</p><p>The experts of the Jin family seemed to have already seen Jin Xiang awakening the origin secret skill from the origin divine force factor.</p><p>With Jin Xiang’s strength, once he awakens the origin secret skill, his combat power will skyrocket. He will definitely shine during the great void Royal sacred Academy’s conference and even be valued by the sacred Emperor. Then, the Jin clan will be able to soar.</p><p>In the formation, Jin Xiang was overjoyed. He looked at the divine power Pearl in his hand carefully and wanted to put it in his storage ring.</p><p>But the next moment, Jin Xiang’s expression changed.</p><p>The divine power origin bead couldn’t be put into the storage ring.</p><p>Jin Xiang tried a few more storage rings, but the result was the same.</p><p>“Damn it, I can’t put it away!”</p><p>The Golden Elephant was furious.</p><p>The divine power origin bead had been releasing a strange energy fluctuation. If he couldn’t put it away, it would be easily discovered and hard to hide.</p><p>It would be very difficult for them to survive the month.</p><p>How could he not be angry?</p><p>The others were also surprised. The divine power origin bead couldn’t be put away?</p><p>“Nine blades, you’ve gone too far!”</p><p>The voice of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sounded in the ears of the nine saber Heavenly King, and it was extremely cold.</p><p>The nine blade Heavenly King must have done something to the divine power origin bead so that it could not be put away. In this case, it was almost impossible for the person who had the divine power origin bead to hide and live a month in peace.</p><p>He would definitely be hunted down and robbed by others.</p><p>One could imagine how intense the battle would be.</p><p>The more intense the fight, the deeper the conflict between the families.</p><p>“Too much? How could this be? Since it’s a competition, the more intense it is, the better. Otherwise, do you think it’s so easy to get a treasure like the divine power Pearl?”</p><p>Heavenly King Nine blades sneered in response.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
