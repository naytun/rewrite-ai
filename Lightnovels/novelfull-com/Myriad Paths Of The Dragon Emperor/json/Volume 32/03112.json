He spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying.</p><p>divine Lord! It’s a divine Lord!</p><p>Bone shouted in shock.</p><p>That cold-looking middle-aged man was actually a divine Lord realm powerhouse.</p><p>Divine Lords were the true overlords in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They rarely fought and represented invincibility.</p><p>Now, there was actually a Sir God making a move.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Behind him, the black-clothed old man and the other two had also arrived. When they saw the cold-looking middle-aged man, they cried out in alarm.</p><p>This man was the clan head of sikong clan.</p><p>.com</p><p>what trash! If I didn’t take action personally, they would have escaped!</p><p>The clan head of sikong clan roared.</p><p>The black-clothed old man and the other two didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>Although the distance between a peak God King and a God monarch was only a step away, the difference was like heaven and earth. It was even greater than the distance between a peak heavenly God and a God King.</p><p>They couldn’t break the bone demon’s defense even when they tried their best, but the head of sikong family broke it with a casual slash.</p><p>“We’re finished, let’s go!”</p><p>The bone demon growled. Disregarding its injuries, it led Lu Ming and the rest and was about to rush in another direction.</p><p>“You still want to leave in front of me?”</p><p>The head of sikong clan said indifferently as he took one step forward and caught up with bone demon and the other three. He then slashed out his palm like a saber.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another shocking blade-light slashed towards bone demon.</p><p>This blade had completely locked on to bone demon, so he couldn’t escape.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The blade light hit the bone devil’s head, and blood splashed as the bone devil’s head was directly cut off.</p><p>You Long’s body was slashed and he could no longer protect Lu Ming and the others. Lu Ming and the others retreated hurriedly and stood in the void, their faces pale.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of black light shot out of you Long’s head. It was a pitch-black skeleton, bone demon.</p><p>The bone demon rushed into Lu Ming’s glabella and shouted, ” “We’re doomed, Lu Ming. We’re really doomed this time. I didn’t expect to provoke a divine Lord. This time, we’re going to die together!”</p><p>“Divine Lord …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth was full of bitterness.</p><p>Behind them were three peak God kings and in front of them was a Sir God.</p><p>A divine Lord was simply too powerful. Even you Long’s physical body was easily destroyed. They didn’t stand a chance at all.</p><p>interesting, you Long’s body is controlled by another soul. Moreover, it’s a divine Lord realm you Long’s body. What a pretty good harvest!</p><p>The sikong clan master chuckled as he waved his hand and put away you Long’s body.</p><p>You Long’s body was a divine Lord’s body. His entire body was filled with treasures. Even divine Lord experts were tempted.</p><p>Then, the sikong clan leader looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>At this moment, in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the quantity and battle formula rapidly shrunk into a light spot to avoid being discovered.</p><p>Han Ying and Wu Shan’s faces turned pale and their bodies started to tremble.</p><p>It wasn’t that he was afraid, but that his body couldn’t help itself when facing such a terrifying existence.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming was rapidly thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>But none of them worked.</p><p>Against such an existence, any scheme would be useless and would be crushed by the other party with a single slap.</p><p>“Purple copper coffin!”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming thought of the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>If he really couldn’t, he could only try to open the purple copper coffin by force.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not confident that he would be able to kill such a terrifying expert like the sikong clan’s patriarch even if he opened the purple bronze coffin. He might even lose his life.</p><p>“Your name is Lu Ming, right? Very good, to be able to do this at such a young age, in so many years, you are the first one. This Lord will kill you with my own hands!”</p><p>The sikong clan leader said coldly as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, the sikong clan’s patriarch took action, leaving no room for Lu Ming to speak.</p><p>A vast saber-light slashed toward Lu Ming, Han Ying, and the others.</p><p>It was dazzling, extremely dazzling.</p><p>In the eyes of Lu Ming and the rest, it was as if there was only this flash of Saber Light. Everything else had disappeared.</p><p>The saber Light slashed at them, but Lu Ming and the rest did not move.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want to move, but they couldn’t.</p><p>“Move, move!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He wanted to take out the purple-copper coffin and fight to the death. However, he could not move his body at all. He was suppressed by an invisible aura.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He knew that he was too naïve. Even if he had the purple bronze coffin, he could not use it against an expert like the sikong clan’s patriarch.</p><p>He couldn’t even risk his life.</p><p>“Could it be that I’m really going to die Here today?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. At this moment, many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>The saber Light was about to land on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>If this ray of light really fell, Lu Ming and the rest would definitely not be left with a single ash.</p><p>However, at this moment, the space in front of Lu Ming and the rest also rippled. Then, two huge, pitch-black fingers stretched out from the ripples and clamped the saber Light that was slashing down.</p><p>An unbelievable scene appeared.</p><p>However, the destructive Saber Light that was released by the head of sikong clan was caught by the two fingers.</p><p>Then, with a slight shake of his finger, the blade light shattered with a bang.</p><p>Lu Ming, Han Yi, Wu Shan, and the others, as well as the three peak Divine King powerhouses behind them, were dumbfounded.</p><p>The attack of a divine Lord realm was actually easily destroyed.</p><p>“Finger of extermination, finger of extermination, heaven … The Heavenly King …”</p><p>The clan head of sikong clan changed his face greatly as he roared. In the end, his voice even started to quiver with a terrified look.</p><p>“Sikong Nan, you’re so bold!”</p><p>A majestic voice suddenly rang out and reverberated in the universe.</p><p>Then, the two fingers retracted and a figure suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>This person had a burly figure and was dressed in luxurious clothes. Lu Ming and the rest could only see his back, but they still felt that he was extremely majestic.</p><p>This person’s aura was as vast and boundless as the universe.</p><p>“Heavens … Heavenly King, subordinate sikong Nan greets Heavenly King!”</p><p>The clan head of sikong clan looked extremely bad; however, he still cupped his hands and bowed towards Ye Feng respectfully with fear in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were shocked.</p><p>Heavenly King?</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, there was only one person who was called a Heavenly King and could make sikong Nan so fearful and respectful. That was the person in charge of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the nine absolute Heavenly King.</p><p>However, why would the nine Arts Heavenly King be here?</p><p>Behind them, the three peak Divine King experts ‘expressions also changed wildly, becoming extremely unsightly.</p><p>The nine absolutes Heavenly King didn’t say anything and just looked coldly at sikong Nan.</p><p>Sikong Nan forced a smile on his face and said,”Heavenly King, you … Why did you suddenly come here? Could it be that I’m just passing by? I have something to do, and I’ll report to the Heavenly King immediately after I’m done!”</p><p>With that, he shot a look at the three peak Divine King experts behind him, telling them to attack and kill Lu Ming and the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
