He cast the star explosion and the power of destruction enveloped the other party.</p><p>At the same time, an ancient door appeared above Lu Ming’s head. It was the door of domination.</p><p>&Nbsp; the explosive star and the God’s Gate struck at the same time with astonishing power.</p><p>arghh! the ghost king screamed as his body exploded, never to recover.</p><p>With the death of the ghost king, the other black-robed swordsmen and black-armored swordsmen all left.</p><p>“Are there any treasures of extreme Yin?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation as he made his way to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, two trees that were filled with dense yin energy attracted Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>“Yin blocks, there really are, and there are two of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The yin Qi of these two Yin building blocks was very dense, and each of them was similar to the one on the ninth floor.</p><p>As expected of the tenth level of the eighteen levels of hell, it was extraordinary.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming took out his saber and cut two Yin building blocks. He then let the quantity formula devour them.</p><p>After collecting the yin building blocks, Lu Ming took a step forward and headed to the door of the eleventh level. He then arrived at the eleventh level.</p><p>The eleventh and tenth levels were very similar. The ghosts were also swordsmen in black clothes and black armor, but they were slightly stronger. To Lu Ming, it was not difficult.</p><p>After some time, Lu Ming found the ghost king on this level.</p><p>The ghost king on the eleventh floor was also a swordsman in black riding a warhorse.</p><p>The only difference from the tenth level was that this ‘ghost king’ had more subordinates, reaching three thousand.</p><p>There were even first-tier divine kings among the three thousand swordsmen in black and black armor. They had formed a formation and were charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With so many powerful ghostly beings forming a large formation, the difficulty of the battle increased exponentially. Even Lu Ming had to take it seriously and use all his strength. He even used the door of domination to fight these ghostly beings.</p><p>After a while, the ghost king charged in and joined the Army of Ghosts to besiege Lu Ming.</p><p>This ghost King’s strength was similar to the one on the tenth floor. The main difficulty was that his subordinates knew how to use tactics.</p><p>After killing for a full hour, Lu Ming finally killed the ghost king and passed the eleventh level.</p><p>On this floor, Lu Ming also obtained two Yin building blocks.</p><p>“12th level!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not stop and stepped into the twelfth level.</p><p>The dark ape battle clan was even more shocked.</p><p>he has entered the twelfth level! The war ancestor has entered the twelfth level!</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>Many of the underworld ape war clan members exclaimed in surprise. They had even changed the way they addressed Lu Ming. They now called him war ancestor. It was clear that they had completely acknowledged Lu Ming in their hearts.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the twelfth level and realized that there were some differences between this level and the eleventh level.</p><p>Other than the swordsmen in black and the swordsmen in black armor, there were also other ghosts, such as zombies and skeletons.</p><p>All the ghostly beings that had appeared on the previous floors had also appeared here.</p><p>All kinds of ghostly beings had astonishing strength. The majority of them were half-step divine kings while the weakest were ninth level heavenly deities. There were even the occasional Divine King ghostly being.</p><p>Lu Ming killed his way through and finally found a Ghost Army camp.</p><p>Yes, it was really a military camp, a military camp where the Army of Ghosts was stationed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, a headless swordsman in black riding on a warhorse walked out of the military camp with an Army of ghostly creatures.</p><p>it’s this guy again. It seems that this guy is the ghost king here! Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Just like on the eleventh floor, the ghost kings here would form a large formation and fight Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the ghost king joined the Army of Ghosts in the battle against Lu Ming.</p><p>The strength of the ghost kings here was about the same as the ghost kings on the eleventh and tenth floors. The main problem was that the Ghost Army was difficult to deal with.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>While they were fighting, a loud roar came from another direction. Then, another army appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Wasn’t there already an Army of Ghosts here? why was there another one?</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground trembled as the Army of Ghosts charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was an Army completely made up of zombies.</p><p>The leader of the group was a golden-furred Zombie King.</p><p>nest, it seems like there’s more than one ghost king on this level!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Yuan Huan and the others had only said that they had to kill the ‘ghost king’ on each level to pass, but they did not say that there was only one ghost king on each level.</p><p>The two armies surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the Zombie King also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In this way, the pressure on Lu Ming increased.</p><p>He used his full strength and all kinds of techniques. The gate of domination was the main attack, while the other attacks were constantly attacking the ghosts and the two ghost kings in all directions.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming was immune to soul attacks. If it were any other prodigy, they would not have been able to withstand it and would have been defeated long ago, even if they had Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“Battle formula, five times the battle power!”</p><p>In the process of the battle, Lu Ming activated the battle formula with all his might.</p><p>The probability of Lu Ming activating the battle formula that increased his combat power by five times was only one in tens. However, after Lu Ming’s continuous activation, he finally succeeded.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s strength increased. He felt that his muscles were bulging and he had an inexhaustible amount of strength.</p><p>what a powerful force! My divine body almost couldn’t withstand it!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>And this was the first level of the battle formula. He immediately realized that fivefold combat power was a huge burden on his divine body. With his current divine body, he could barely withstand it.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the ancient God’s heart, which was constantly refining his divine body, allowing his divine body to slowly evolve towards the ancient god level. Otherwise, even if he had comprehended the battle symbol art and increased his battle power by five times, he wouldn’t be able to use it.</p><p>The activation of the battle formula increased his combat power by fivefold. Lu Ming’s abilities had also increased by a large margin.</p><p>The power of the battle symbol art and the master’s door stacked together, and the power was even more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The gate of domination pressed down and bombarded the body of the Zombie King. The Zombie King roared in anger, and his incomparably hard body was shattered into pieces. He was killed in one move.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and sent the black-robed swordsman King flying. He also killed a few hundred black-robed and black-armored swordsmen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
