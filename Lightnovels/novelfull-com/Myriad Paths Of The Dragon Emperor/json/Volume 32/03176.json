A terrifying spearlight appeared between the sky and the earth and burst forward.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang …’</p><p>All the ghosts within tens of thousands of miles of the spear, regardless of their cultivation, exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>All of a sudden, a crack that was tens of thousands of miles long appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The power of the domineering divine spear was no weaker than the door of domination. The two were on par.</p><p>However, one should not forget that the godly skill that Lu Ming cultivated was a spear-type godly skill.</p><p>If Lu Ming held the tyrannical divine spear in his hand and cast a divine skill, the power would be even stronger and surpass the door of domination.</p><p>“Then, let’s pass this level!”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of pride and revealed a confident look.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His body moved and broke through the air, rushing towards the area where the ghosts were.</p><p>When he arrived at the ghost king’s area, a large Army of Ghosts charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The overwhelming ghostly aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At least half of the ghost king Army were first level divine kings, and some of them had even awakened the divine power source.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw the Golden-furred Zombie King and the headless swordsman King in Black on the first few floors. These existences were only generals here, not Kings.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had never been able to pass this level. Just this Army of Ghosts alone was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and swung his fists. In the sky, nine-clawed divine Dragons emerged one after another. There were a total of thirty-six nine-clawed divine Dragons that pounced toward the Army of Ghosts.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation of a half-step Divine King, the power of the divine Dragon materialization technique was naturally different from before. It was much stronger.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The thirty-six nine-clawed divine Dragons charged forward and entangled a large number of ghostly beings.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he charged into the depths of the ghostly creatures.</p><p>Long before he had reached this place, Lu Ming had already triggered the quintuple combat strength. His combat strength was at its peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a sweep of his spear, he hit a golden-furred Zombie King.</p><p>The Golden-furred Zombie King was a King from the previous levels. It was a first tier Godking and had awakened the divine power factor twice. It was as strong as Yuan Yu.</p><p>However, the Golden-furred Zombie King couldn’t block the spear at all. Its body was blown away like a cannonball. After killing hundreds of ghosts, its body also exploded.</p><p>One move, instant kill.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, a shocking roar came from the depths of the Army, and a giant creature appeared.</p><p>A Bone Dragon that was ten thousand meters long appeared. It was the ghost king of this level.</p><p>His cultivation was at the second tier of the God King realm, and his divine power factor had awakened twice. His strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The bone dragon twisted its body and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid of the bone dragon at all.</p><p>His palm glowed and an ancient stone spear appeared. It was Lu Ming’s other origin secret skill, the domineering divine spear.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The power of the domineering divine spear was unleashed and slashed at the bone dragon.</p><p>The skeletal dragon roared and stretched out its sharp claws to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the bone dragon’s claw collided.</p><p>The Dragon claws of the skeletal dragon were covered with divine power that had awakened the origin divine power factor, but they still could not block the attack of the spear. At the moment of collision, the Dragon claws shook violently and then exploded, turning into bone fragments that flew everywhere.</p><p>One of the bone dragon’s huge claws exploded.</p><p>When he used the tyrannical divine spear, its power was much more terrifying than that of a divine weapon. It was very smooth and increased the power of Lu Ming’s divine skill by 20%.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the tyrannical divine spear streaked across the void, lashing at the bone dragon’s head.</p><p>The skeletal dragon let out a long roar and tried its best to resist.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, who had combined the tyrannical divine spear and the divine skill, was extremely powerful. He had completely surpassed the bone dragon.</p><p>No matter how hard the skeletal dragon tried to resist, it could only take a beating. Under Lu Ming’s attacks, the skeletal dragon was forced to retreat, its body being hit by Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Every time it was hit, a large piece of the bone armor on the skeletal Dragon’s body would explode.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming finally struck the bone dragon’s head with his spear. The bone dragon’s head exploded, and it was completely killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After the skeletal dragon was killed, the other ghostly beings ran away and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Level fifteen, passed.</p><p>On this level, Lu Ming found two more crystals that contained ultimate yin energy.</p><p>Then, a pitch-black Vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>This was the whirlpool that led to the sixteenth floor.</p><p>the 18 levels of hell will have a huge increase in difficulty every three levels. I wonder how hard the 16th level is. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed into the door, entering the sixteenth level.</p><p>Beyond the eighteen levels of hell …</p><p>The 16th floor of the stone tower lit up.</p><p>All the experts of the dark ape battle clan widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>he has passed the fifteenth level! The war ancestor has actually passed the fifteenth level!</p><p>eighth level celestial deity passed the fifteenth level. This is simply inconceivable. It’s simply a miracle!</p><p>a heaven’s favorite, a rare heaven’s favorite. Under the leadership of the war ancestor, the dark ape war clan will definitely rise to power. In the future, our name will shake the great void Holy dynasty, no, the entire universe!</p><p>Some of the dark ape battle clan members couldn’t help but roar as their faces turned red with excitement.</p><p>They were all old monsters who had lived for countless years and had seen all kinds of big scenes. However, they had never heard of talents like Lu Ming’s. It was no wonder that they were so excited.</p><p>Even Yuan Huan and Yuan Cong’s breathing became extremely heavy.</p><p>The 16th level …</p><p>“What a terrifying ghostly being …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>As soon as he arrived on the sixteenth floor, he was besieged by many ghosts. Furthermore, the strength of these ghosts was actually all at the first level of the Godking realm.</p><p>A large number of First Firmament divine kings surrounded Lu Ming. Fortunately, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had improved greatly over the years. He had improved in all aspects and was able to withstand the attacks of these ghostly beings.</p><p>If this had happened when Lu Ming had just entered the eighteen levels of hell, he would definitely not have been able to withstand the attacks and would have been killed by these ghosts.</p><p>He killed his way through and broke out of the encirclement. He found a stone pillar to rest, and after resting, he rushed out again.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming spent a few years and finally found the ghost king.</p><p>When he found the ghost king, Lu Ming turned around and left without hesitation.</p><p>The main thing was that the ghost king and his subordinates here were too terrifying.</p><p>The Army of thousands of ghostly creatures, under the leadership of the ghost king, charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Judging from his aura, the ghost king’s cultivation had reached the third level of the Godking realm. Moreover, he had awakened the divine force origin factor twice.</p><p>With this level of strength, he could probably kill the ghost king on the fifteenth level in a second.</p><p>In addition, the ghostly Army under his command was all godkings, and there was no lack of existences like the Golden-furred Zombie King.</p><p>There were a few terrifying generals among them who were at the second tier of the Godking realm. They were also existences who had awakened the origin divine power factor twice. They were equivalent to the fifteenth level ghost kings.</p><p>It was just that his subordinates were ghosts and they were already so terrifying. With so many of them charging at Lu Ming, it would be strange if he did not escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
