If he did not use it, they would not be able to tell. If they saw that Lu Ming had mastered two ultimate laws, they would not know what kind of expression they would have.</p><p>also, this little guy has used a disguising technique. It’s very brilliant!</p><p>Some emperors muttered.</p><p>Naturally, it was impossible for Lu Ming to hide his divine breath from the great emperor.</p><p>However, these great emperors had never seen him before. Although they could tell that he had used the disguising technique, they did not know Lu Ming’s real identity.</p><p>After Lu Ming sent Mu yang flying, he continued to charge toward Mu yang.</p><p>At this moment, Mu yang no longer had the will to fight. He only wanted to escape.</p><p>However, he was not willing to rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat.</p><p>This was because as long as they passed this selection, they would be able to obtain a great opportunity to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>I must hold on. As long as 1 pass this selection, I’ll be able to enter the Martial Emperor realm. At that time, 1’11 skin this kid alive and extract his meridians!</p><p>Mu yang roared in his heart.</p><p>However, the next moment, he was scared out of his wits because Lu Ming had come again. Lu Ming’s attack had pierced through his defense and landed on his back. Blood splattered everywhere. A huge hole was blasted open on Mu Yang’s body, and the light from the front to the back could be seen.</p><p>Of course, this kind of injury could only severely injure Muyang, but not kill him.</p><p>Mu yang was lying on the ground like a dead dog. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Now, even if he wanted to rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat, he could not do it.</p><p>“Stop, boy. Mu yang is a Supreme prodigy of the MU clan. If you dare to kill him, you’ll be buried with him!”</p><p>Outside the fighting ring, an expert of the MU family shouted with all his might.</p><p>Muyang was the Son of God, his talent was unparalleled, he couldn’t die.</p><p>The MU family’s powerhouses wanted nothing more than to destroy the fighting stage and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>shut up, are you all going to interfere with the battle of the ten lands? ”</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor glanced coldly at the MU family expert, causing him to shut up obediently with an ugly expression.</p><p>This middle-aged Emperor was from the Overlord Force of Destiny city.</p><p>Furthermore, the battle of the ten lands was jointly organized by the great emperors of the various lands and no one had the right to interfere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he walked toward Muyang.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold and aloof voice rang out from behind Lu Ming. An extremely powerful pressure pressed down on Lu Ming. He felt as if there was a ferocious beast staring at him from behind, ready to launch a fatal blow at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around slowly and saw a young man walking toward him with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Yuan Xin!</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos!</p><p>Yuan Xin had a slender figure and a handsome face. With his hands behind his back, he had an invincible aura.</p><p>It was true. He walked around the fighting ring as if he was taking a stroll in the courtyard. No one dared to make a move on him.</p><p>That was because Yuan Xin was known as one of the most powerful people among the younger generation of the yuan continent. She was extremely terrifying.</p><p>yuanxin, help me kill him. Help me kill this kid!</p><p>Seeing Yuan Xin, Mu yang shouted excitedly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>Yuan Xin did not say anything. He continued to walk slowly toward Lu Ming. His pace was not fast, but his aura grew stronger with each step.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. He could sense a sense of danger from Yuan Xin.</p><p>“Yuanxin is going to make a move!”</p><p>Around the fighting ring, many people’s eyes lit up, and even many of the older generation showed interest.</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, was famous for his fighting prowess. He was extremely powerful, and even the other sons of heaven had to bow their heads in front of him.</p><p>He was ranked alongside Destiny’s Child and was known as one of the strongest.</p><p>“Muyang and yuanxin are good friends, so it’s normal for yuanxin to help when Muyang is injured!”</p><p>that tianyun is in trouble. He doesn’t stand a chance against Yuan Xin!</p><p>let’s hope he can last until the selection ends. Otherwise, it’ll be a pity if such a genius doesn’t pass the selection!</p><p>Many people thought that Lu Ming was not Yuan Xin’s match and would be defeated.</p><p>son of chaos, I’d like to see your true combat strength!</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. There was a sharp glint and a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Although he had fought with Yuan Xin during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment, there had been many restrictions at the time. Their cultivation bases had been suppressed to the same level, and even their divine abilities and bloodlines had been suppressed. They had not been able to unleash their true battle prowess.</p><p>“If you want to see, then I’ll let you see!”</p><p>Yuan Xin said coldly and arrogantly. She took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming, throwing a punch.</p><p>This punch was like an archaic divine mountain pressing down. Space howled as it was directly pierced through.</p><p>This punch was extremely terrifying, and even an ordinary one-star Martial Emperor would find it difficult to withstand it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body swayed like a huge Dragon. His powerful physical strength burst out. His Saint power surged and blasted out along his arm.</p><p>It was also a punch!</p><p>Lu Ming also used the death law, the devour law, and the array Dao law in this punch.</p><p>The two fists collided heavily.</p><p>The entire fighting ring rumbled violently, and the void trembled continuously. Terrifying energy swept in all directions.</p><p>Nearby, some young men were hit by the energy and were sent flying out of the fighting ring, spitting out blood.</p><p>Some of the heaven’s favorites with high cultivation changed their expressions and dodged the attack.</p><p>The two of them trembled and swayed.</p><p>The first move didn’t determine the winner.</p><p>“You have some strength. Let’s see how many moves you can take!”</p><p>Yuan Xin’s expression did not change even though he did not manage to force Lu Ming back with one move. The Laws of Chaos emanated from his body, making his aura even more oppressive.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin’s fists kept punching out. The fist forces were like meteorites, smashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Death’s eye!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with radiance. Rays of light shot out like combat weapons and slashed at Yuan Xin’s fist force.</p><p>These rays of light were not only the death law, but also other laws.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“This Yuan Xin is indeed very strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had now combined three types of laws. Although his mastery of the laws of death and the law of devouring had not reached their limits, the eruption of the three types of laws, together with his spiritual body and Saint power, had given him an astonishing combat strength. However, he could not do anything to Yuan Xin.</p><p>He realized that Yuan Xin’s physical body was also astonishingly strong, not much weaker than his.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>He had already reached 99% mastery of the chaos laws. Once he used the chaos laws and fused them with the death laws, the two ultimate laws would fuse, and the power would skyrocket.</p><p>However, now was not the time to expose himself.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, after a few more moves, the two of them exchanged blows and retreated a few steps at the same time.</p><p>your combat strength is indeed very strong. Unfortunately, your cultivation is too weak. You are no match for me!</p><p>At this point in the battle, Yuan Xin’s eyes finally lit up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a shocking aura burst out from his body. The aura was as vast as the ocean, like a Thousand Waves, sweeping through the sky..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
