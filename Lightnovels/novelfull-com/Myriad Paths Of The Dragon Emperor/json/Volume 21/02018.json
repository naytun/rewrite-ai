Could it be that the world itself also had a consciousness?</p><p>that’s right. Some powerful existences once speculated that the world itself actually has a consciousness. For example, when the heaven realm or the primordial realm is invaded by the evil god tribe, they will be in a defensive state. The space will become relatively firm and not easy to break through!</p><p>the most important thing is that when a world is in danger, this world will give birth to a group of heaven’s favorites. Many terrifying physiques will appear in groups!</p><p>just like now, in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, geniuses are like clouds, constantly emerging. All kinds of King physiques, and even the sons of God, are constantly appearing. In the past, it was simply impossible!</p><p>in fact, this is the defense of the world. It gave birth to many heaven’s favorites. When these heaven’s favorites mature, they can defend against enemies. This is the golden age we have now!</p><p>Emperor formless continued to explain, and everyone’s hearts were in turmoil.</p><p>This was the first time they had heard of such a thing.</p><p>The gathering of heaven’s pride experts, the king physique competition, and the various scholars competition for supremacy were actually a defensive state of the world itself.</p><p>therefore, all of you are the hope of the future, the hope to resist the evil god tribe. That’s why the three of us established the yuan mountain sacred Academy to gather all of you together and do our best to nurture you. We hope that you will grow faster!</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. So this was the reason why the three great emperors convened a meeting at the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>“The great emperor is truly selfless!”</p><p>Some people sighed, especially when they thought of the unknown fate of Sky Fire Emperor and huntian Emperor. Some people felt sad.</p><p>Compared to Emperor formless, Sky Fire Emperor, and huntian Emperor, Emperor Heng, emperor he, and Emperor tianluo were all extremely despicable and selfish.</p><p>of course, this is only the first point. The second point is that the battle of the ten lands will be held soon. This time, it is said that there will be a great opportunity. Therefore, we want you to grow faster and seize the opportunity!</p><p>Emperor formless continued.</p><p>“The battle of the ten lands?”</p><p>Everyone looked puzzled. They had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>the battle of the ten lands is a meeting held by many great emperors in the ten lands of the primordial realm. It will gather all the elites of the ten lands. When the elites compete, it will also be accompanied by great opportunities. The goal is the same. It will nurture this batch of elites and allow them to grow faster!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled, and it was difficult for them to calm down.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands would gather all the geniuses of the ten lands. How many geniuses would there be in the ten lands?</p><p>How intense would the competition between the paragons be?</p><p>Such a thing had never happened before in history.</p><p>This was the first time!</p><p>this time, the battle will be held in the divine fated land, and there will be countless powerful cultivators participating. It will be accompanied by a great opportunity that will be of great help to your cultivation. If you want to rise before the war with the evil god tribe and have the ability to protect yourself in the future, you can not miss this battle!</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice caused everyone’s hearts to stir.</p><p>“Great emperor, when will the battle begin?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to break through and reach the peak, he could not miss such an opportunity. However, he still had to go to the land of infinite demons to save Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Three years later!”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>three years later? it’s too late!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>three years later, the divine Lands will gather. At that time, you will face the geniuses of the entire primordial realm. Therefore, if you want to stand out in the battle of the ten lands and seize opportunities, you have to improve continuously in these three years. Otherwise, you will only be a foil. Do you understand?”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone roared.</p><p>“Alright. Now, Lu Ming, Lu Xiangxiang… You guys stay here, the rest of you may leave!”</p><p>Then, Emperor formless named a group of people.</p><p>After that, some people left, leaving only a few dozen behind. Lu Ming swept his gaze across them and realized that almost all of them had King physiques. Only a few of them did not have King physique.</p><p>Bubbles, Huang Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others were all there.</p><p>At this moment, the space rippled, and a few more figures appeared.</p><p>Uncle Kong and the Holy Emperor, the Emperor who was like an Emperor.</p><p>Several great emperors appeared at the same time.</p><p>you are the most talented group of people in Yuan mountain. In the next three years, we will send you to some strange places. Each place is related to the laws you have comprehended and will greatly help you in your cultivation!</p><p>Emperor formless continued.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. The place the great emperor had chosen must be extraordinary and would be of great help to their cultivation.</p><p>“Great emperor, I’m afraid 1 can’t go!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and cupped his fists.</p><p>1 know. You’re going to the land of myriad demons, right? ”</p><p>Emperor formless nodded.</p><p>Saving people is more important. But if you want to borrow the ancient demon coffin, you still have to rely on yourself. Those guys in the land of ten thousand demons, even if we show up, it won’t have the slightest effect. It might even backfire!</p><p>Uncle Kong said.</p><p>“Those demonic cultivators are all arrogant, Hmph!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor coldly snorted.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I want to follow brother Lu Ming too, chirpy!”</p><p>The bubble hung around Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“Little guy, we’ll take you to a place that will be of great help to your cultivation. Are you really not going?”</p><p>Emperor formless looked at bubbles.</p><p>“I’m not going!”</p><p>Bubbles shook her head vigorously.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly, bubbles, go and cultivate with the great emperors. We’ll meet again very soon!</p><p>Bubbles was a space-time spirit mouse and was blessed by the heavens. His talent was even stronger than the average child of God. If he continued to follow him, it would limit his talent instead.</p><p>All this while, bubbles had been following him and her cultivation progress had not been too fast. This time, Lu Ming planned to let bubbles cultivate with the great emperor so that she could improve faster.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a sense of urgency. He did not know when the evil god tribe would attack. All of them had to make the best use of their time to improve their abilities.</p><p>If not for the fact that he had to save Qiu Yue, Lu Ming would have followed the great emperor to cultivate.</p><p>but bubbles can’t bear to leave brother Lu Ming. Chirpy!</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s neck and rubbed its small head against him.</p><p>be good, Papao. Go and improve your abilities. Otherwise, you won’t be able to help Brother Lu Ming in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>don’t. Bubbles must help Brother Lu Ming…</p><p>Pao Pao blinked her large eyes and finally agreed to go cultivate with the Thearch.</p><p>alright, I’ll give you three days to prepare. Three days later, we’ll take you away!</p><p>Emperor formless said. After that, the other great emperors all left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go for a drink…”</p><p>Desolate li and the others walked over.</p><p>After that, everyone drank to their heart’s content and then gathered at the divine fated land to compete with the heaven’s favorites from other regions.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Three days later, Lu Ming left the heavenly Emperor City alone with Qiu Yue..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
