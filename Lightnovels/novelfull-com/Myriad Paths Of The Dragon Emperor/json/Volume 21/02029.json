Every 10000 years, they would decide which clan would take control of the youluo devil Kingdom. Therefore, this was the biggest event in the past 10000 years, and countless people had gathered here.</p><p>There were people everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming and the people from the Luo family were sitting on the grandstand on the east side of the fighting ring.</p><p>The spectators ‘stand was filled with the Luo family’s experts. At a glance, Lu Ming could see many void emperors and true emperors.</p><p>The Father of the little princess, Luo Xuan, was also from the Luo family. He sat at the very front.</p><p>On the west side of the fighting ring were the you family.</p><p>At this moment, the two sides sized each other up.</p><p>“That Lu Ming actually sided with Luo Xuan. Damn it!”</p><p>Ji Peng saw Lu Ming and immediately shouted angrily.</p><p>Ji Tian and you ning also looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>the Ji family is really useless. I’ve already chased Lu Ming out and I can’t find him. Instead, he’s relying on Luo Xuan!</p><p>You ning’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he roared in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was very strong and he could easily defeat Ji Peng. He would have some influence on this competition.</p><p>When she chased Lu Ming out, she had already thought that Lu Ming might join Luo Xuan in a fit of anger.</p><p>However, she was also clear that once she expelled Lu Ming, the Ji family would not let him off. Lu Ming would most likely be killed by the Ji family and would not have the chance to rely on Luo Xuan.</p><p>He did not expect the Ji family to be so useless. Lu Ming had actually escaped and even successfully sought refuge with Luo Xuan.</p><p>“I must kill Lu Ming if I have the chance during the competition!”</p><p>You ning sent a voice transmission to Ji Tian, Ji Peng, and the others.</p><p>“Don’t worry, if this kid touches me, I’ll make him die a terrible death!”</p><p>Ji Tian spoke with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“If he touches me, I’ll make him wish he was dead!”</p><p>A yellow-robed young man said coldly.</p><p>This yellow-robed young man was called Huang Song. In the youluo demonic kingdom, Huang Song was the strongest aside from the king physique. He was ranked first among the ten strongest heaven’s favorites after the king physique. He was much stronger than Ji Peng.</p><p>You ning, Ji Tian, and the others sized up Lu Ming and the others. Lu Ming, Luo Xuan, and the others were also sizing each other up.</p><p>according to the old rules, each side will send 50 heaven’s favorites to fight in pairs until the end. The winner will be the winner!</p><p>Luo Xuan sent a voice transmission to everyone.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This rule was simple.</p><p>this time, among the younger generation, our two sides have two King physiques each. Their cultivation levels are about the same, so the battle of King physiques will likely result in both sides suffering losses. Therefore, the battle of non-King physiques is very important!</p><p>Luo Xuan continued. The king physique he mentioned did not include Lu Ming. The fact that Lu Ming was a King physique had not been spread out yet.</p><p>however, other than the king physique, there’s one person you have to pay attention to. That is Huang Song. Although he doesn’t have a King physique, his battle power is very strong. He has had a fortuitous encounter, so his spirit physique is stronger than ordinary spirit physiques. Furthermore, this person’s divine arts are also very well-trained. You have to be careful when you meet this person!</p><p>Luo Xuan warned. Many people nodded their heads. They were naturally aware of Huang song’s methods.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew onto the fighting ring.</p><p>This person was very old and was an elder of the youluo devil Kingdom. He was also the judge of this competition.</p><p>“The participants of this competition, please go up the stage first!”</p><p>The doyen spoke, his voice like a great Bell.</p><p>“Let’s go up!”</p><p>Luo Xuan rose to his feet first, followed by the rest of the people, and flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>You ning, Ji Tian, and the others also went up the fighting ring.</p><p>Each side had fifty people. As long as they were below the age of fifty, they could participate.</p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the fighting ring, Ji Peng, Ji Tian, and Huang Song looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>kid, you better pray that you don’t meet me. Otherwise, 1’11 make you die a terrible death!</p><p>The first one to speak was Huang Song. His eyes revealed a cruel smile.</p><p>On Luo Xuan’s side, some people’s expressions changed slightly. Huang song’s methods were extremely cruel. Many of his enemies had died miserably.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you shouldn’t have turned to Luo Xuan!”</p><p>You ning also spoke coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, if I shouldn’t join them, do 1 have to follow your wishes and be killed by the Ji family after being expelled? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>sister you ning, you don’t like Lu Ming, but 1 treat him like a treasure. Don’t give you a big surprise later on, hehehe!</p><p>Luo Xuan laughed.</p><p>You ning’s expression was cold, and he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Next, the founding members Assigned Numbers to them.</p><p>On each side, it was number 1 to 50.</p><p>Then, the board of patriarchs would place the 50 numbers on both sides into a box and draw at random. Whichever two numbers were drawn, the two people would fight.</p><p>The number that Lu Ming was assigned to was 31.</p><p>After the numbers were assigned, everyone returned to their respective stands.</p><p>As for the founding member, he drew a number from each of the two boxes. “Number six from the Luo family, number thirty-nine from the you family!” The elder announced his name.</p><p>The next moment, two figures rushed up to the fighting ring and began to fight.</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle. The you family had won because the person from the you family had a much higher cultivation. In just a few moves, he had severely injured the genius from the Luo family and blasted him off the fighting ring.</p><p>The you family had won the first battle. Everyone in the you family was smiling.</p><p>The doyens continued to draw numbers. In the second Battle, one of the Luo family’s people had a stronger cultivation base and won.</p><p>the third round, Luo family’s number 31, you family’s number 5!</p><p>The elder reported the number.</p><p>“It’s my turn so soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He got up and rushed to the fighting ring.</p><p>The one from the you family was a burly young man. However, when he saw Lu Ming, his face darkened.</p><p>Just now, you ning had sent him a voice transmission, telling him that Lu Ming had once defeated Ji Peng. He wanted him to exchange a few moves with Lu Ming to exhaust some of Lu Ming’s Saint energy and then admit defeat.</p><p>Being able to defeat Ji Peng, the burly youth knew that he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, eat my axe!”</p><p>The burly young man roared. He raised his battle axe and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>His purpose was to consume some of Lu Ming’s holy power.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>A sizzling sound came from Lu Ming’s hand, and the black demonic lightning flashed. Then, Lu Ming struck out with his palm, and the demonic lightning formed a huge palm, blasting toward the burly youth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly young man’s body was sent flying out of the fighting ring and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>this kid has some strength. It’ll be more fun to kill him like this!</p><p>Huang Song licked his lips, and his malevolent expression became even more intense.</p><p>As for Luo Xuan, the purple-robed young man, and a few others who had seen Lu Ming in action before, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>“What’s going on? Demonic lightning law. Didn’t lu Ming use the array Dao law back then? How did it become the devil lightning law?”</p><p>could it be that he has mastered two types of nomological laws? ”</p><p>Luo Xuan and the others revealed looks of disbelief.</p><p>It was unheard of for a Saint to control two laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
