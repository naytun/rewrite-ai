The pressure on Lu Ming was instantly lifted.</p><p>“Senior ice screen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The figure was Qiu Yue’s master, Bing mu.</p><p>“If you want to attack, then I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>He Qian was incomparably overbearing. His palm was like a blade as he slashed down at the ice screen, wanting to destroy it.</p><p>“Ice seal!”</p><p>The ice curtain stretched out a finger and pointed.</p><p>Instantly, with the finger of the ice curtain as the center, endless ice spread out as if it could freeze everything.</p><p>The temperature between heaven and earth dropped rapidly. A terrifying cold Qi not only sealed he Qian’s blade light in ice, but also spread towards he Qian.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! he Qian roared, and the power of his world erupted. A terrifying power blasted toward the cold Qi.</p><p>However, wherever the cold air passed, even the world power of the ice curtain was frozen. The terrifying cold air enveloped he Qian. In a flash, an Ice Mountain appeared in the sky, and he Qian was sealed in ice.</p><p>One move to seal a true Emperor in ice, shocking everyone.</p><p>He Qian’s shocked expression could be seen through the ice Mountain.</p><p>He didn’t seem to have expected that he would be frozen by the ice curtain.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The true emperors of the he clan roared and attacked the ice Mountain together.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ice Mountain exploded, and he Qian appeared. He retreated frantically, his face pale and his body covered in a layer of frost.</p><p>“This person’s cultivation level is very high. Let’s attack together and kill her!”</p><p>He Qian roared. At the same time, he circulated the power of the world to dispel the cold energy on his body.</p><p>The several true emperors of the he clan attacked at the same time.</p><p>The combined attack of the true emperors was terrifying but the ice screen wasn’t afraid at all. It pointed its finger out continuously and the ice Qi spread out. It actually blocked all the attacks from the true emperors.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. The ice curtain was very powerful.</p><p>The true emperors from the he family weren’t ordinary true emperors. They were experts among the true emperors but they were still blocked by the ice curtain.</p><p>No wonder the ice curtain dared to attack the Daluo heaven sect alone.</p><p>After exchanging dozens of blows, the he clan’s true Emperor was unable to do anything to the ice Barrier and retreated with an unsightly expression.</p><p>“You are the ice curtain of the only holy temple!”</p><p>Someone from the he family recognized the ice curtain and said seriously.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The ice curtain didn’t deny it.</p><p>“Ice curtain, are you sure you want to be the enemy of the he family? It’s not good for your only temple!”</p><p>He Qian said coldly.</p><p>hehe, the he clan is an Emperor-level force, but they mobilized so many experts just because some Emperor-to-be couldn’t defeat a few juniors. Don’t you feel ashamed?”</p><p>Ice curtain mocked.</p><p>Many people of the he family looked upset.</p><p>It was true that some of the Emperor-to-be elders in the great emperor-level force were no match for Lu Ming, a junior. Therefore, the he family sent so many Martial Emperor powerhouses to deal with Lu Ming. It was indeed a laughable act.</p><p>do you think that the he family sent so many experts and mobilized so many people because of this?”</p><p>A true Emperor from the he clan said indifferently.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed. Could it be that the he family had come here for other matters?</p><p>Lu Ming, you impersonated a member of the he family and killed the disciples of the Heng family. Then, you impersonated a member of the Heng family and killed the disciples of the he family. You incited a war between the he family and the Heng family and caused the he family to suffer heavy losses. You deserve to die ten thousand times for your crime!</p><p>A true Emperor of the he clan said coldly.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Such a thing actually happened?</p><p>Back then, many people had heard about the war between the he clan and the Heng clan. The reason was that the true Emperor expert of the he clan, he Qian, had embezzled one of the Heng clan’s treasures. The Heng clan had been indignant and sent experts to kill the disciples of the he clan.</p><p>The he family retaliated by sending experts to kill the Heng family’s disciples.</p><p>Because of this, the conflict between the two sides was completely aroused, and they started a Great War.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was really the one who did this?</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Laws of Chaos. Other than the kingly laws and the ultimate laws, he could transform them all. In that case, it was possible.</p><p>Almost everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>If this was true, Lu Ming’s methods were truly shocking. He had single-handedly caused two Emperor-level forces to suffer heavy casualties.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly and did not say a word.</p><p>He already knew that this matter could not be hidden for long.</p><p>Back then, the Heng family and the he family had fought because the two families had deep conflicts. They were like gunpowder that ignited at the slightest spark.</p><p>However, as long as both parties calmed down and thought about it carefully, they would discover many loopholes and could easily speculate that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, you don’t have to deny it. We’ve speculated in detail and negotiated with the Heng family. This is definitely your doing!</p><p>A true Emperor from the he clan said.</p><p>“Yes, I did it!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke. Since he had already guessed it, there was no need to deny it.</p><p>“Little bastard, you deserve to die!”</p><p>He Qian shrieked loudly, wishing he could tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually used his matter to provoke a war between the two races. It was really hateful.</p><p>“That’s right, he deserves to die ten thousand times!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice came from the sky. Then, another group of powerhouses descended.</p><p>“The Heng family!”</p><p>Ice curtain said in a serious tone.</p><p>“The Heng family is also here!”</p><p>The faces of Huang Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others were extremely ugly.</p><p>After the he family, the Heng family also arrived.</p><p>Moreover, the experts from the Heng family weren’t any weaker than the he family. How were they going to fight?</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who looked calm!</p><p>Lu Ming, how dare you sow discord and cause the Heng family to suffer heavy losses. You deserve to die a thousand times. Hand over the celestial Emperor’s sword first, and I’ll leave your corpse intact!</p><p>One of the Heng clan’s true emperors said with a cold and arrogant voice.</p><p>“Another bunch of cowardly things that are worse than pigs and dogs!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Some people were shocked. In the face of such a situation, Lu Ming still dared to say such things about the Heng family. He was really bold.</p><p>The Heng family experts were all furious.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll suffer a fate worse than death. You’ll pay a terrible price for your words!”</p><p>One of the Heng clan’s true emperors said coldly.</p><p>you got angry so easily. It seems that you know how despicable you are, but you refuse to admit it. Once someone pointed it out, you have to suppress the other person with brute force to cover up your vileness and shamelessness. You are just deceiving yourself. Vileness is vileness!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his voice spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>The people from the he family and the Heng family ail looked extremely upset.</p><p>When everyone else was fighting against the evil god tribe, they had hidden themselves. After that, they came out to snatch other people’s territory. Whether they were despicable or not, they naturally knew it in their hearts.</p><p>But they would never admit it, and they wouldn’t allow anyone else to say it. Once they did, they would die!</p><p>They were just a bunch of lowly, self-deceiving people.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were exactly what they were thinking.</p><p>There were even people from the younger generation of the two families who revealed a look of shame on their faces, but they quickly hid it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
