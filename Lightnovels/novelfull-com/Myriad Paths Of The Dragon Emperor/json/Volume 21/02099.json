They were all mu clan’s prodigies, and two of them had King physique.</p><p>The MU family was indeed powerful. Not only did they have Mu yang, a Son of God, but they also had two King physiques. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>Before Lu Ming even arrived, the terrifying light of death had already enveloped the three Mu family powerhouses.</p><p>The three mu clan elites were shocked and tried their best to block.</p><p>However, Lu Ming knew it in an instant. The light of death burst out in his eyes again.</p><p>This was death’s eye, a terrifying innate technique that possessed astonishing killing power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Rays of light burst out from Lu Ming’s eyes. They were like combat weapons that made clanking sounds as they charged at the other party.</p><p>With a miserable scream, one of the three Mu family geniuses, who did not have a King body and had a slightly weaker cultivation, was directly killed and his body was cut into several pieces.</p><p>Even the two King bodies were heavily injured.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that they were all in the Emperor-to-be realm and the laws had formed a River around them, they would have been killed. Even so, there were a few wounds on their bodies, and blood was flowing out. The power of death attached to the wounds, trying to take away their vitality.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming smacked down with his palm. The two mu clan’s King physiques spat out mouthfuls of blood and retreated.</p><p>“Muyang, save us!”</p><p>One of the MU clan’s King physiques roared in fear.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Mu yang let out a long howl. He abandoned Lu Xiangxiang and the others and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. A cold murderous intent flashed in his eyes. In his hand, the death law turned into a sword light and slashed out.</p><p>Not only did this sword light contain the law of death, but it also contained the law of devouring and the law of array Dao. Its power increased dramatically, and the two mu clan King bodies couldn’t block it at all. With two shrieks, two heads flew up into the air, and blood spurted ten meters high.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Outside the fighting ring, there were also experts of the MU family who were watching. They roared like wild lions, full of killing intent.</p><p>The death of two mu clan’s King bodies was a world-shaking event for the MU clan. The price was too great, and their hearts were bleeding.</p><p>Normally, a King body had the potential to become a great emperor.</p><p>Such geniuses were too precious, but now, they were both killed.</p><p>However, even though the people of the MU family were furious, they did not dare to make a move on such an occasion. They could only watch helplessly, hoping that Mu yang could kill Lu Ming and avenge the MU family’s King physique.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the two mu clan’s King physique, he moved like a bolt of lightning and rushed toward Mu yang.</p><p>Now that Muyang had abandoned Lu Xiangxiang and the others, he could naturally make his move.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>die! Mu yang roared. He activated the void law and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also sent a palm strike.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two attacks collided, but the result was that Mu Yang’s body shook violently, and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>On the fighting stage, the spectators were shocked.</p><p>Especially the experts of the MU family.</p><p>How was it possible that Muyang was no match for him?</p><p>Muyang was known as one of the seed experts this time. He was extremely powerful and had already begun to develop a small world. He had lost to Lu Ming back then because Lu Ming was too abnormal.</p><p>But now, a child of death had appeared out of nowhere and was able to suppress Mu yang.</p><p>there are too many experts in the world. There are many hidden heaven’s favorites that we don’t even know about!</p><p>that’s right. The so-called seed experts from before aren’t the strongest. No one knows how many stronger heaven’s favorites there are in the dark!</p><p>“What’s the name of this child of death? His strength is astonishing!”</p><p>I think he’s called tianyun. That’s the name he used to register!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>On the fighting ring, Mu yang roared angrily. He was actually forced to retreat. This made him furious. The aura on his body became more and more violent as he launched an intense attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming met his enemy head-on and exchanged blows with Mu yang.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming completely suppressed Mu yang. Mu yang kept retreating. The void law on his body seemed to be penetrated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s palm broke through Mu Yang’s defense and landed on his body. Mu yang cried out in pain as his body flew out and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Muyang, is this all you’ve got? It’s ridiculous that you can be called a seed expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and strode towards Mu yang.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Mu Yang’s eyes were red. The Saint energy in his body was boiling, and the void energy was constantly pouring into his body from the void, giving off a bright light.</p><p>“The ocean of nothingness!”</p><p>Mu yang used his most powerful move and conjured an ocean of nothingness that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Mu yang seemed to have gone crazy as he controlled the void Ocean.</p><p>The void Ocean let out a rumbling sound and transformed into all kinds of terrifying attacks, trying to turn everything in the void Ocean into nothing.</p><p>Nearby, a few people did not manage to escape and were directly swept into the sea of nothingness. They let out shrill screams and turned into nothingness.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>However, a terrifying rumble came from the sea of nothingness. It was like a drum being shaken, and the sea of nothingness started to roll violently.</p><p>Mu Yang’s expression changed. He tried his best to control the void sea, but it was useless. The void sea trembled more and more violently. Finally, with a boom, it exploded and a figure stepped out.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His killing intent was wild as he charged at Mu yang.</p><p>He was determined to kill Muyang.</p><p>Mu Yang’s expression turned ugly. He retreated rapidly, not daring to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost!”</p><p>Mu yang ran like crazy. Anyone who stood in his way was either killed or sent flying off the fighting stage.</p><p>However, he still could not escape. Very soon, Lu Ming caught up to him.</p><p>He could only fight with all his might. However, after a few moves, he was struck by Lu Ming’s move. His body was sent flying and he coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His body almost exploded.</p><p>“How could this be? Tianyun’s nomological laws had not reached perfection, and he had not reached the Emperor-to-be realm. How could he be so strong? Even Muyang can’t resist it?”</p><p>Some people were dumbfounded. On the surface, Muyang’s cultivation base was indeed stronger. They were both children of God, but how could there be such a huge difference in their combat strength?</p><p>that little guy doesn’t only control one law of death. He also controls other laws. This is a fusion of laws!</p><p>An immortal Emperor spoke, his voice filled with shock.</p><p>Although Lu Ming could merge several types of laws and hide them well, ordinary people would not be able to tell. However, the great emperor was a figure that could not be hidden. As long as he paid more attention, he would be able to tell.</p><p>“What? A fusion of several laws?”</p><p>that’s insane. Those below the rank of martial Supreme can actually control several types of nomological laws!</p><p>Many people were shocked..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
