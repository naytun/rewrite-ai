All they had to do was register their names, so the turn was also very quick.</p><p>Soon after, Lu Ming, Luo Xuan, and the others also went to register.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice was heard. A figure stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Gang Yan!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. What was Cang Yan trying to do?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not qualified to take part in the competition. You may leave!”</p><p>Cang Yan looked down at Lu Ming from above, his eyes cold and filled with killing intent.</p><p>Many people looked over with curiosity, including the experts of the older generation in their seats.</p><p>“Cang Yan, what do you mean? If he’s not qualified, then you’re not qualified either. Don’t forget that you were defeated by Lu Ming a few days ago!”</p><p>Luo Xuan took a step forward, glaring at Cang Yan as she shouted.</p><p>“What? Cang Yan was defeated?”</p><p>“Really? this is the young man? Me looks so ordinary!”</p><p>Many people were shocked. They looked at Lu Ming in bewilderment.</p><p>In the eternal devil nation and the many other devil nations under its rule, other than the Son of God, Cang Yan was the most powerful heaven’s favorite, and almost no one could defeat him.</p><p>This person had actually defeated Cang Yan?</p><p>What was his background?</p><p>After all, the heaven’s favorites that Cang Yan had invited were only a small portion of the people present. Many of them did not know about the battle between Lu Ming and Cang Yan.</p><p>The paragons who were present at that time were afraid of offending Cang Yan, so they did not say anything after they returned. Therefore, not many people knew that Lu Ming had defeated Cang Yan.</p><p>When Luo Xuan said that, everyone was naturally shocked. Many people even doubted whether what Luo Xuan said was true.</p><p>Even many of the older generation looked at Lu Ming with curiosity.</p><p>To be able to defeat Cang Yan was no small matter. Such a heaven’s favorite would definitely have great achievements in the future and was naturally worth paying attention to.</p><p>Cang Yan’s face turned extremely gloomy. Luo Xuan didn’t give him any face at all, directly revealing his defeat in public.</p><p>during this period of time, I’ve sent people to investigate this person, but there are no clues at all. We can’t find out this person’s origin at all. This person’s origin is unknown, so he doesn’t have the qualifications to participate in the competition!</p><p>Cang Yan shouted.</p><p>“The purpose of this competition is to celebrate the great Emperor’s victory. As for what kind of background it has, what does it matter?”</p><p>Luo Xuan argued.</p><p>“His background is unknown. Who knows what he is planning?”</p><p>Cang Yan sneered.</p><p>“Great emperor, how should we do this?”</p><p>The ashen Demon King asked the ancient Emperor for instructions.</p><p>I’ve already handed this matter over to you. You have full authority to handle it!</p><p>The ancient Emperor waved his hands. He wasn’t interested in the conflict between the younger generation.</p><p>Standing at his height, he only had the attitude of watching a show.</p><p>He would only pay attention to the Son of God.</p><p>“Yes, great emperor!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King saluted, and with a flash, he appeared above Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The Azure Demon King spoke in an imposing manner.</p><p>“It’s like this…”</p><p>Luo Xuan spoke first and explained the situation.</p><p>the great emperor has just passed a Great Tribulation. It’s a grand event that only happens once every three hundred thousand years. There can’t be any mistakes. You may leave!</p><p>The Azure Demon King looked at Lu Ming and waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and Luo Xuan’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was not allowing Lu Ming to participate in the competition.</p><p>Cang Yan sneered.</p><p>Not far away, you ning, Ji Tian, and the others also revealed gloating smiles.</p><p>“Your Highness, I did defeat Cang Yan, but you can’t protect him because of this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His voice was so loud that it spread in all directions.</p><p>His meaning was obvious. Cang Demon King was deliberately making things difficult for him because of Cang Yan.</p><p>“Impudent! What’s with your attitude? how dare you doubt this King!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King bellowed, his body exuding a terrifying aura as he glared at Lu Ming.”Your background is unknown. I’m already being kind by not taking you down on the spot. If you still dare to speak, don’t blame this King for being impolite if you don’t leave!”</p><p>The scene was silent. No one said anything.</p><p>The head of the Luo family felt that the Azure Demon King had gone too far. The Azure Demon King had great authority in the eternal devil nation, and there was no need for him to offend the Azure Demon King over this matter.</p><p>It was just that he couldn’t participate in the competition. In his opinion, it was a small matter.</p><p>However, this was a big deal for Lu Ming as it concerned the ancient demonic coffin.</p><p>However, it was obvious that the Azure Demon King would not give him the chance.</p><p>The ancient Emperor looked on indifferently. Even though he also felt that the Azure Demon King had gone overboard, he wouldn’t say anything more since he had already let the Azure Demon King take charge.</p><p>“Still not retreating!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King shouted again. His terrifying aura pressed down on Lu Ming like a tidal wave, forcing him to retreat. He was under immense pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and was extremely unwilling.</p><p>But in the end, Lu Ming still retreated.</p><p>The strength of the Azure Demon King was shockingly strong. Even if he wasn’t a great emperor, he was at least a peak true Emperor expert. He couldn’t do it by force, so he had to think of another way.</p><p>Cang Yan’s mouth curled into a sneer.</p><p>He did not allow Lu Ming to participate for two reasons. One was to take revenge on Lu Ming. The second reason was that Lu Ming’s abilities were too shocking. If Lu Ming were to participate, he would have no hope of getting into the top three.</p><p>The registration continued!</p><p>It took half a day for the registration to end.</p><p>After the registration ended, the competition began. The two-on-one matches were very intense.</p><p>However, all of this had nothing to do with Lu Ming. He sat in his seat and drank while thinking about his next step. He was thinking about how he could borrow the eternal demonic coffin for a month.</p><p>It was normal for martial arts powerhouses, or even those who had reached the sage realm, to sit there for a few months.</p><p>Therefore, the competition went on one after another. In a flash, a few days had passed.</p><p>After a few days of competition, most of the people had been eliminated, leaving only a few dozen people.</p><p>These dozens of people were all extremely talented, and many of them even had King physiques.</p><p>“The land of infinite demons is indeed a place to fight. The overall standard of the geniuses is even stronger than the yuan mountain!”</p><p>Towards the end, Lu Ming also focused his attention and observed.</p><p>He realized that the number of heaven’s favorites in the land of infinite demons was about the same as in the distant mountains, but the quality was higher.</p><p>For example, the average cultivation of the land of infinite demons was higher than the yuan mountain.</p><p>Many of them had reached absolute Saint cultivation. Some of them had even reached the peak or perfected absolute Saint.</p><p>For example, Luo Xuan had a King body in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage, but she didn’t have any advantage over these geniuses. There were at least 20 to 30 people who weren’t weaker than her.</p><p>This wasn’t even all of the geniuses in the land of infinite demons. It could only be half.</p><p>There were so many powerful geniuses. It was as if they had reached the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. It was shocking.</p><p>However, in the past few years, after the cultivation and competition in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, as well as the battle with the evil god tribe, many people’s cultivation bases had risen.</p><p>Many powerful King bodies had reached the peak of absolute Saint or perfected absolute Saint..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
