It was extremely terrifying and most suitable for people who cultivated demons.</p><p>Once he used the law of ten thousand demons, he seemed to be able to summon the will of an ancient demon. Using the will of an ancient demon to attack his enemies was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Although their cultivation levels were similar, Cang Yan was at a disadvantage.</p><p>He roared and tried his best to fight with his opponent. However, after exchanging dozens of moves, he was still no match for his opponent. He was sent flying off the fighting ring and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was defeated in just a few dozen moves, and his opponent was only ranked fourth in the immortal demon nation.</p><p>Didn’t that mean that there were three more heaven’s favorites above him?</p><p>Could it be that the other party had three sons of God?</p><p>impossible! I’ve always heard that the immortal demon nation only has two sons of God!</p><p>how is that possible? this person cultivates the law of myriad Devils and the light of the law. His combat strength is astonishing. Other than the Son of Heaven, who else is stronger than him? ”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>The experts from the ancient devil nation had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s face was dark as well.</p><p>Today was the day of celebration for him surviving the Great Tribulation, but the immortal demon nation had come and provoked him with the name of their younger generation. This was equivalent to slapping his face.</p><p>And yet, the eternal demon nation was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another figure rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>The son of the void!</p><p>The hearts of many were moved. This was the second ranked child of the void from the eternal devil nation.</p><p>The child of the void strode towards the expert from the immortal demon Kingdom. His powerful aura made the other party’s face extremely solemn.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man from the immortal demon Kingdom also rushed up the fighting ring, and his aura rushed towards the child of the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The son of the void’s figure was blocked.</p><p>“Void no law again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly froze.</p><p>The genius from the immortal demon nation had also grasped the law of the void, just like the child of void from the eternal demon nation.</p><p>Two Sons of the Void!</p><p>in the land of myriad Devils, there are two children of the void and two Super Devil nations, each with one. These two are fated opponents. When they first rose to power, they often fought. Almost every year, they would fight, and until now, it has been difficult to determine the winner!</p><p>Luo Xuan’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears as he explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>A different person grasping the same ultimate law. This was indeed a fated opponent.</p><p>Everyone wanted to be the strongest, and only by stepping on their opponents could they truly climb to the top.</p><p>This was more meaningful than defeating the other children of God.</p><p>Therefore, once two identical sons of God met, a great battle would definitely breakout.</p><p>Unless the difference in cultivation between the two sides was too great, there would be no point in fighting.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fated opponents knew each other too well. They didn’t say anything else and just started fighting.</p><p>The fearsome laws of the void collided continuously, as if everything was about to be reduced to nothingness.</p><p>At the same time, the number one expert from the eternal demon nation, the son of death, was Walking in the Air. The law of death revolved around him as he looked at a heaven’s favorite from the immortal demon nation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>That elite also soared into the sky and stood opposite the child of death. A terrifying aura exploded from his body, and a mysterious law burst out at the same time.</p><p>“It’s the primordial chaos laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He finally saw a new law of the top ten.</p><p>The primordial chaos laws were the most similar to the chaos laws among the ten ultimate laws.</p><p>He still had three wisps of nebulous primordial chaos in his hands.</p><p>The two sons of God stood opposite each other, their auras clashing and creating terrifying waves.</p><p>“It’s not the first time we’ve fought. It’s hard to determine the winner!”</p><p>The son of primordial chaos spoke.</p><p>As the top geniuses of the land of infinite demons, they naturally knew each other and had fought more than once.</p><p>“If you don’t have the confidence to defeat me, then there’s no point in coming here today!”</p><p>The child of death said coldly.</p><p>Although the other heaven’s pride experts of the immortal demon nation had the upper hand earlier, the other party couldn’t defeat the children of heaven. Even if they had the upper hand earlier, it was meaningless.</p><p>“We are not the ones fighting you today!”</p><p>At that moment, the son of primordial chaos spoke.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>If they weren’t the ones fighting the child of death, who else could it be?</p><p>Could it be that there were other sons of God in the immortal demon nation?</p><p>I can tell you that in the past, i was ranked first in the immortal demon nation. But now, I’m ranked second!</p><p>The son of primordial chaos continued.</p><p>The people from the ancient devil nation were shocked.</p><p>The son of primordial chaos could only be ranked second?</p><p>Could it be that he had already been defeated by the child of the void from the immortal demon Kingdom?</p><p>However, the cultivation base of the son of void from the immortal demon Kingdom had yet to reach the limit of an absolute Saint in the great circle. Moreover, even if he had reached the limit of an absolute Saint in the great circle, he might not be able to defeat the son of primordial chaos. At most, they would be on par.</p><p>Other than the son of void, there was actually someone stronger than the son of primordial chaos in the immortal demon nation?</p><p>The crowd found it hard to calm down.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, on the side of the immortal demon nation, a young man stepped out. Every step he took caused the void to rumble.</p><p>It was an ordinary-looking young man, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt with his arms exposed.</p><p>His arms were pitch-black, like demonic iron, and seemed to be filled with explosive power.</p><p>His eyes were dark, but they shone with ambition.</p><p>Everyone from the eternal devil nation turned to look at this man.</p><p>Could this man be the number one genius of the immortal demon nation?</p><p>Stronger than the child of primordial chaos?</p><p>impossible. This person’s cultivation looks like he’s only in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. They’re both in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. How can he be stronger than the son of Hongmeng?”</p><p>that’s right. It’s said that the son of primordial chaos ‘cultivation has already reached the limit of the perfected absolute Saint realm. He’s just a step away from becoming an Emperor-to-be, which is equivalent to the son of death!</p><p>Many people in the ancient devil nation were discussing this matter, but they couldn’t understand why.</p><p>Even the ancient Emperor and the other powerful beings were looking at this young man curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming was also sizing up the young man. He could vaguely feel that the young man gave him a strong pressure, as if there was a terrifying power in this person’s body.</p><p>He had never felt such pressure, not even when he was facing the stellar River or the son of primordial chaos.</p><p>“My name is ancient devil!”</p><p>The young man said indifferently, his voice reverberating throughout the entire area.</p><p>After he finished speaking, he looked at the child of death and said,” “Today, your opponent is me!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the two Sons of the Void exchanged a blow and retreated.</p><p>The child of the void from the ancient devil nation glared coldly at ancient devil.</p><p>“You want to fight us? Let’s see what you’re capable of!”</p><p>The child of the void from the ancient devil nation was incomparably overbearing. With a wave of his hand, a beam of void light shot out towards ancient devil.</p><p>This kind of void light was extremely terrifying. As long as it swept past, everything would be reduced to nothing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The elder Devil made his move.</p><p>His attack was very simple. It was just a simple punch..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
