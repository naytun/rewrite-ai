At first, he did not seem to believe it, but slowly, it turned into surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing called out in disbelief, as if he was dreaming.</p><p>“Little Qing, it’s me!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also overjoyed.</p><p>Xie nianqing finally woke up. It seemed like he was fine.</p><p>It had been several years since they last met. It would be a lie to say that he didn’t miss her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing seemed to have finally confirmed that it was Lu Ming. She rushed out of the eternal demonic coffin and into Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>Lu Ming wrapped his arm around Xie nianqing’s slender waist and held him tightly in his arms.</p><p>After a long time, the two separated.</p><p>“Little Qing, why are you here? How did he appear in the ancient demonic coffin? how was the Ice Dragon ancestor? And who are those black-robed men?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a series of questions. He was indeed full of doubts.</p><p>“Back then, the Ice Dragon patriarch and 1 escaped from evil Spirit’s pursuit…”</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing told her about her experiences over the years.</p><p>Back then, Xie nianqing and the Ice Dragon patriarch had escaped evil Spirit’s pursuit and accidentally escaped to an ancient ruin.</p><p>The ancient ruins were extremely mysterious. While exploring the ancient ruins, Xie nianqing accidentally stepped onto an ancient teleportation array and was directly teleported to the demonic sea of the land of infinite demons.</p><p>In the demonic sea, she had encountered those black-robed men.</p><p>Xie nianqing told him that the demonic sea had fallen from the heaven realm during the ancient war. Some of them had not died and had been passed down since then. They were the black-robed men.</p><p>All these years, she had been cultivating in the demonic sea. She wanted to leave, but those black-robed men wouldn’t let her.</p><p>“So, the Ice Dragon patriarch is still in the ancient ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s possible. However, the ancient ruins are very mysterious. There might be other teleportation arrays. The Ice Dragon patriarch might have been teleported to another place!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>how did those black robed men steal the ancient demonic coffin and place you inside?”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s biggest question.</p><p>I don’t know. Those people are always so mysterious!</p><p>Xie nianqing said, seemingly unwilling to elaborate. He changed the topic and asked Lu Ming,”Why are you here? How did you survive all these years?”</p><p>“It’s like this…”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming briefly recounted his experiences over the years.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it turns out that you have experienced so much!”</p><p>Xie nianqing leaned on Lu Ming gently.</p><p>“But I’ve finally found you. No matter how much I’ve experienced, it’s all worth it!”</p><p>Lu Ming put his arm around Xie nianqing’s shoulders.</p><p>“However, that girl of yours is dead set on you!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing suddenly looked at Lu Ming again. His big eyes blinked, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p>“Are you jealous?” Lu Ming touched his nose.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was very straightforward and nodded. However, he immediately said,” however, she’s devoted to you and can even die for you. If you let her down, I won’t let you off!</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Lu Ming was a little confused.</p><p>What did Xie nianqing mean by this? He was jealous but he also told Lu Ming not to let Qiu Yue down. Lu Ming could not figure out what he was thinking.</p><p>“A heartless person is not worth entrusting your life to. Hmph, you won’t understand even if I tell you. What are you waiting for? Quickly put that little girl of yours into the ancient demonic coffin!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Mm, okay!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly took out the Dayan elixir furnace and placed Qiu Yue into the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>There was a mysterious power in the eternal demonic coffin that immediately enveloped Qiu Yue’s body. Qiu Yue’s face seemed to be more ruddy, and Lu Ming could finally put his heart at ease.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kept the ancient demon coffin into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had not seen each other for many years. They had many topics to talk about and the two of them started chatting again.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>As they were chatting, Xie nianqing suddenly frowned. A trace of pain flashed across his eyes and he let out a soft ‘hmm’.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed all of this.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>“No, nothing much?”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled and shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming was suspicious. Xie nianqing had clearly looked like he was in pain.</p><p>“Could it be that little Qing is injured?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He held Xie nianqing’s small hand and sensed it carefully. However, he realized that Xie nianqing was in good health and was not injured at all.</p><p>“Little Qing, do you know what’s going on with this Canyon? Do I really have to charge all the way to the end before 1 can leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded, there is a heavenly region in the nine Skies of the heaven realm. It is called the ancient demon heavenly region. Almost everyone there is a demonic cultivator. The ancient foreign races invaded and fought until the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. Many demon cities and demon mountains fell from the heaven realm, forming the demon sea!</p><p>and this mountain fell from the heaven realm. In the heaven realm, this mountain should belong to an extremely powerful force, and this Canyon was used by that force to test their disciples.</p><p>only the strongest below the martial Supreme realm can pass through this place. If they can’t, they’ll be trapped here for the rest of their lives or even die of old age!</p><p>“Such a strict assessment!” Lu Ming was also secretly shocked.</p><p>Once one entered this Canyon, there was no other way out except to use extremely strong combat power.</p><p>This was forcing him to continuously improve and squeeze out his potential.</p><p>As expected, devil cultivators did things differently. They were very evil.</p><p>how strong is the strongest below the martial Supreme? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>I’m guessing that the strongest below the martial Supreme realm is just a saying. Or rather, it’s just a boundary. There’s always a higher mountain. Who knows what’s the strongest combat strength? it’s just a boundary. Once you reach that boundary, you’ll be able to leave!</p><p>Xie nianqing explained. She had been in the demonic sea for a few years and had learned a lot from the black-robed men.</p><p>it seems like 1 can only break out by constantly improving my strength!</p><p>Lu Ming said. With his current ability, it was obvious that he could not break out.</p><p>After that, the two of them chatted for a long time. Lu Ming then went to one side, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming went to challenge the checkpoint again. He was still no match for the two middle-aged burly men and was forced back.</p><p>After returning, Lu Ming continued to cultivate. After a few days, he would attempt it again.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s improvement was very fast.</p><p>However, there was one thing that worried Lu Ming. He had seen Xie nianqing frowning a few times and a flash of pain in his eyes.</p><p>But when he asked Xie nianqing, he said he was fine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could clearly sense the worry in Xie nianqing’s eyes.</p><p>“Little Qing, is there anything you and 1 can’t say? If there’s anything, you must tell me!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to Xie nianqing’s side and hugged her gently.</p><p>Xie nianqing suddenly wrapped his arms around Lu Ming’s neck and whispered in his ear,” “Lu Ming, I want to bear your child!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
