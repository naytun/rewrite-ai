Luo Xuan’s gaze swept over Lu Ming from time to time. He felt that Lu Ming was not as simple as he seemed.</p><p>The competition continued!</p><p>Luo Xuan and the purple-robed young man attacked one after the other, easily winning.</p><p>In addition, the Luo family also had a King physique. He was very powerful and defeated his opponent in one move.</p><p>On the you family’s side, you ning and Ji Tian naturally won easily. Ji Peng also won.</p><p>As for Huang Song, he was even more brutal. He showed no mercy and instantly tore a heaven’s pride expert from the Luo clan into pieces. He stood on the fighting stage, bathed in blood, and roared like a murderous beast.</p><p>On the Luo family’s side, other than Lu Ming and a few others, everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>Soon, the first round was over.</p><p>Both sides had fifty people, but after the first round, there was a difference in the number of people.</p><p>The you family had been in charge of the youluo demonic kingdom for 20000 years and had a deep foundation. Naturally, there were more geniuses who submitted to them. Hence, after the first round, the you family had gained the upper hand.</p><p>After the first round, the you family still had 28 people, while the Luo family only had 18 people.</p><p>Why wasn’t the total number of people on both sides 50? because in the process of the war, some people were injured by both sides. Therefore, the total number of people on both sides was naturally less than 50.</p><p>The second round of the competition was the same as the first round. The number of the remaining people from both sides would be placed in the box and the drawing of lots would begin. The two people who were drawn would fight.</p><p>This way, the side with more people would definitely have an advantage.</p><p>This was because the side with more people would not need to fight, and they could save their physical strength and holy power.</p><p>In the second round, Lu Ming also appeared very early. However, the opponent he met was not strong and he was easily defeated.</p><p>After that, Luo Xuan and another King body also won.</p><p>“You family’s number three versus Luo family’s number five!”</p><p>At this moment, the doyen’s voice rang out again.</p><p>“It’s the two of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>You family’s number three was Huang Song!</p><p>No. 5 from the Luo family was the purple-robed young man who had tried to test Lu Ming previously. His name was Wu Xi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Huang song’s figure appeared in the fighting ring. He looked at Wu Xi with a ferocious expression and shouted,” haha, Wu Xi, 1 didn’t expect it to be you. Hurry up and get up here to die!</p><p>Wu Xi stood up with a grave expression.</p><p>Among the top ten young experts other than the king body, Huang Song was ranked first and Wu Xi was ranked fifth. In the previous battles, he was definitely not Huang song’s match.</p><p>“If you can’t defeat him, then admit defeat. It’s more important to save your life!”</p><p>Luo Xuan sent a message to Wu Xi.</p><p>Wu Xi nodded and rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>The two of them started to fight.</p><p>Huang song’s combat strength was indeed stronger than Wu Xi’s.</p><p>Huang song’s spirit body seemed to be stronger than the average upper-class sky spirit body. His attacks were like a storm and a fierce beast, madly attacking Wu Xi.</p><p>Wu Xi could only defend passively.</p><p>However, after a few moves, he was clawed by Huang Song, and a piece of flesh was torn off his body.</p><p>“Die, die, haha!”</p><p>Huang Song seemed to be even more excited when he encountered fresh blood. His eyes revealed traces of blood-red light, and his attacks became even more violent.</p><p>die! Wu Xi roared. After using her most powerful attack, she rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>He knew that he wasn’t Huang song’s match, and if he continued to fight, his life would be in danger. He could only rush down the fighting stage and admit defeat.</p><p>However, Huang Song clearly did not want to let him off so easily.</p><p>“You want to leave? die!”</p><p>Huang Song roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sky was filled with claw shadows as they headed toward Wu Xi.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood and flesh splattered everywhere. One of Wu Xi’s arms had been torn off by Huang Song.</p><p>Wu Xi endured the pain and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>Hmph, you’re really trash. You don’t even have the courage to fight to the death. 1 think you should just admit defeat as soon as possible!</p><p>Huang Song sneered as he looked at the Luo clan’s heaven’s pride experts with ridicule.</p><p>Many people’s faces were ugly, but at the same time, they also revealed a look of fear.</p><p>Even Wu Xi had been defeated so miserably. On their side, other than the two King physiques, no one could fight with Huang Song.</p><p>If he encountered Huang Song, even his life would be difficult.</p><p>The morale of the remaining people was somewhat low.</p><p>Huang song’s gaze swept coldly over Lu Ming. He sneered a few times and returned to the stands.</p><p>The competition continued, and not long after, the second round of the competition ended.</p><p>The difference in numbers between the two sides was even greater.</p><p>The you family still had 19 people, while the Luo family only had nine.</p><p>In the second round, the you family had ten people who did not need to fight.</p><p>it seems that the you family still has the upper hand in this battle!</p><p>the you family has been in control of the youluo demonic kingdom for 20000 years. They are getting stronger and stronger. Naturally, there will be more geniuses who will join them!</p><p>that’s right. Although both sides have two King physiques, outside of the king physique, the Luo family is far behind.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were discussing.</p><p>Some of the you family experts were already smiling.</p><p>The powerhouses of the Luo family looked gloomy.</p><p>After this failure, the Luo family would have to wait another 10000 years.</p><p>Soon, the third round began.</p><p>Among the remaining nine people from the Luo family, they were all quite strong, so their chances of winning in the third round were high.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know if he was lucky or unlucky. The opponent he met in this round was not strong and he was defeated easily.</p><p>In this round, out of the nine people from the Luo clan, six had won, and three had been eliminated.</p><p>As for the you family, six people were eliminated, leaving 13 people.</p><p>Thirteen against six.</p><p>Then, the fourth round began.</p><p>“You family’s number one versus Luo family’s number one!”</p><p>The youluo devil Kingdom elder was stunned for a moment after drawing two numbers. Then, he reported the numbers.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the scene immediately went into an uproar. Many people were excited.</p><p>Because the first ones on both sides were you ning and Luo Xuan.</p><p>The eldest and youngest princesses of the youluo devil Kingdom were the two most outstanding women in the younger generation of the youluo devil Kingdom. Not only were they extremely beautiful, but their cultivation talent was even more shocking. They both had King physiques.</p><p>Now, these two beautiful princesses were going to fight. Who would win?</p><p>Many people were looking forward to it.</p><p>The two of them stood up and jumped onto the fighting ring. Their eyes met, like divine swords clashing.</p><p>sister Luo Xuan, I’ll make you accept your defeat wholeheartedly!</p><p>You ning smiled, his face still cold and arrogant.</p><p>this is exactly what 1 wanted to say. I will defeat you, defeat all of you!</p><p>Luo Xuan said, revealing two tiger teeth.</p><p>Then, the two of them moved and started fighting.</p><p>As soon as the two of them made their move, they used their divine abilities. The laws of the king path collided in the air, causing loud rumbles to ring out.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>sister Luo Xuan, so that’s all you’ve got? it looks like you’re going to lose!</p><p>You ning smiled. Then, the aura on her body skyrocketed.</p><p>absolute Saint in the great circle! Princess you ning has broken through to the great circle of the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>just like Princess Luo Xuan, she’s been at the pinnacle of absolute Saint all this time. I didn’t expect her to make a breakthrough now!</p><p>1 wonder if Princess Luo Xuan has made a breakthrough. Otherwise, she’ll be defeated!</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm, especially the Luo family, whose faces revealed a heavy expression.</p><p>If Luo Xuan were to be defeated, then the Luo family would truly have no hope this time..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
