They knew that the ashen Demon King had died for nothing.</p><p>This was because the abilities that Lu Ming had displayed were too terrifying.</p><p>Not to mention his rare talent, just that stone golem alone was enough to fight a great emperor. Just that alone was enough for him to gain the respect of the ancient Emperor.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was only a true Emperor. At his age, it was impossible for him to break through to the great emperor realm in his lifetime. Therefore, he would have died in vain.</p><p>“Let’s go back first!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor said.</p><p>Naturally, he wouldn’t give up on the ancient demonic coffin just like that.</p><p>The ancient demonic coffin had been passed down for countless years and was the most precious treasure of the ancient devil nation. It was filled with all sorts of mysteries and he naturally wouldn’t give it up so easily.</p><p>He planned to go back first and bring more experts.</p><p>With that, everyone from the eternal devil nation left the place.</p><p>“Will that brat be alright after he enters?”</p><p>A black-robed Emperor looked toward the canyon.</p><p>martial sovereigns can’t enter this place. Anyone below the rank of a martial sovereign won’t be able to leave unless they’re a heaven-defying genius.</p><p>However, there weren’t many geniuses like that even in ancient times!</p><p>The other black-robed Emperor said.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed into the canyon, he saw the ancient demonic coffin in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly rushed over and looked into the demonic coffin.</p><p>Xie nianqing was lying quietly in the coffin. His breathing was even, as if he was asleep.</p><p>This was definitely Xie nianqing. Lu Ming would not be mistaken. Their auras were exactly the same.</p><p>“Little Qing, little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out softly, but Xie nianqing did not respond at all.</p><p>“Why did little Qing appear here? The ancient demonic coffin must have been stolen by the black-robed Emperor. Why would they put little Qing in the ancient demonic coffin?”</p><p>could it be that little Qing’s soul was also injured? those black-robed men were trying to save little Qing?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of doubts and conjectures.</p><p>However, she would only know the answer after Xie nianqing woke up.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and then looked behind him. He was shocked.</p><p>Because there was no way out!</p><p>It was clearly the entrance of the canyon, the place where Lu Ming had just entered. However, there was nothing there now. There was no entrance to the canyon.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a wave of fist force blasted toward the void. However, it was like a stone sinking into the sea and did not cause any waves, there’s no way out. It seems like we can only move forward!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the front of the canyon.</p><p>In front of him, it was extremely deep and dark. He didn’t know how long it was or where it led.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the ancient demon coffin into the mountain and river diagram and then walked forward.</p><p>“Stop, you can’t pass this road!”</p><p>Suddenly, a figure stood in front of Lu Ming and spoke coldly.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a saber on his back.</p><p>“Senior, I’m here by accident. Please do me a favor!” Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“You can’t pass through this place unless you defeat me!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes and voice were cold as if he was not a real person.</p><p>Lu Ming sized him up carefully. Indeed, he could tell that the middle-aged man was not a real person. He was condensed from energy.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that I still need to go through some tests in order to get out of here?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. In the next moment, he rushed over and cast the prison-suppressing heaven technique, throwing a punch.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A jet-black blade light burst out, splitting the mist and slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber Light collided with Lu Ming’s fist. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him as if it was going to tear his body apart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure could not help but retreat.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the middle-aged man was at the Emperor-to-be realm. However, his strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming had just used the prison-suppressing heavenly art and the chaotic law. The power of that punch was enough to force a one-star void Emperor to retreat. However, the situation just now was the exact opposite. The one who retreated was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit as he stepped forward.</p><p>The light of chaos spread out from his body and covered his entire body.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the chaos Ring and pointed with his finger.</p><p>&Nbsp; a massive chaos finger of tribulation shot toward the enemy.</p><p>At the same time, countless runes appeared in his left hand. Nine Dragons flew out and attacked his opponent.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face was cold and indifferent, as if he would always have that expression.</p><p>The saber in his hand slashed out again. The jet-black saber-light tore apart the primal Chaos tribulation finger and the nine Dragons condensed from the array Dao laws.</p><p>The saber Qi swept across and slashed at Lu Ming. Lu Ming was forced to retreat. Even the chaotic laws and chaotic light that covered his body were almost torn apart.</p><p>What a terrifying combat strength!</p><p>This middle-aged man was definitely an amazing existence among the Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“If separation doesn’t work, then fuse!”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger. Instead of retreating, he advanced and charged towards the middle-aged man. He pointed his fingers continuously and shot out finger forces at the man.</p><p>This was the primal Chaos tribulation finger, but it was indeed the fusion of the primal Chaos laws and the array Dao laws.</p><p>Now, as the two Saint hearts had merged into one, Lu Ming’s two types of laws had also completely merged and the power was shocking.</p><p>&Nbsp; the middle-aged man’s blade exploded with light as it clashed with the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The blade glowed and the energy burst out, constantly bombarding the canyon.</p><p>With their current combat strength, they could definitely tear the ground apart. However, in this Canyon, they could only leave shallow marks on the ground and the walls.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row. Surprisingly, even though Lu Ming used the fusion of two types of laws, he could not gain the upper hand. He only ended up in a draw with his opponent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar and exerted all his strength to the extreme. His Saint heart spun rapidly, and his Saint power surged out like a river.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the power of law to the extreme as he fought the middle-aged man.</p><p>But even so, the two of them were still tied.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged another blow with the other party and retreated a few hundred meters.</p><p>After Lu Ming retreated a distance, the burly man did not pursue him. He just stood there and blocked his way.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He guessed that the middle-aged man’s combat strength was almost on par with the Son of God. Even if he was not as strong, he was not far from it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was very close to an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body was stronger than the average child of God.</p><p>The Saint heart was formed by two Saint hearts and the fusion of two laws. Lu Ming was confident that he could even fight against a Son of Heaven who had become an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>But now, they could only fight to a draw.</p><p>“Just now…”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly thought of something else. He raised his hand and there was a death aura on his palm.</p><p>This was the law of death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
