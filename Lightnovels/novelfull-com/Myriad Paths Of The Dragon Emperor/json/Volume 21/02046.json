As soon as it appeared, it suppressed ancient devil.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Some of the ancient devil nation’s people were delighted.</p><p>Previously, GE long had used this move to defeat the son of the void. Even the void’s law could not break the abyss of death.</p><p>“All living beings who fall into the abyss of death will die!”</p><p>let’s go! GE long said. He exploded crazily, and the death Qi in the abyss of death was extremely dense.</p><p>But the next moment, GE Long’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A deafening explosion came from the abyss of death.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Then, the rumbling in the abyss of death became more and more intense. In the end, the entire abyss of death started to shake violently.</p><p>After more than a dozen explosions, the abyss of death suddenly exploded. A figure covered in demonic light appeared in the sky like an unparalleled demonic god.</p><p>As for GE long, the moment the abyss of death was broken, his body retreated madly, and a stream of blood flowed out of his mouth.</p><p>He was defeated. The son of death, GE long, was also defeated!</p><p>At this moment, the faces of many from the ancient devil nation turned pale!</p><p>Even the strongest person from the eternal devil nation had been defeated.</p><p>This time around, the eternal demon nation had suffered a crushing defeat.</p><p>Just the elder Devil alone was enough to defeat all of them.</p><p>“How could the Son of God be defeated?”</p><p>Especially the young people, they were in disbelief.</p><p>The Son of Heaven was the synonym of undefeated in a battle of the same level. But now, the Son of Heaven had been defeated. Many young men felt their faith crumbling.</p><p>haha! Ancient One, the geniuses of your eternal devil nation aren’t all that great after all. Is there anyone else who wants to come out and give it a try?” The undying Emperor laughed.</p><p>The undying demon nation and the eternal demon nation were the two super demon nations in the land of ten thousand demons. They had been competing with each other for countless years. The undying Emperor was naturally happy to be able to slap the face of the eternal Emperor.</p><p>The other members of the ancient devil nation had ugly expressions on their faces as well. Slapping the face of the ancient Emperor was the same as humiliating them.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that there would be someone from the immortal demon nation who has cultivated the immemorial demon Dao to such a level. It’s really rare!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor spoke.</p><p>haha! This man is a legendary genius of our immortal demon nation. He couldn’t awaken his bloodline since he was young, let alone comprehend intent realm and control the law. But this young man has his own luck. He accidentally obtained the cultivation method of the ancient demonic path. I didn’t expect that he was a peerless genius. After cultivating the ancient demonic path, he advanced by leaps and bounds. His attacks are unparalleled, and even the strongest law can’t stop him!</p><p>Undying Emperor was extremely proud of himself as he gave a simple introduction of ancient devil.</p><p>Many people were surprised that the ancient devil couldn’t cultivate the current martial arts and comprehend intent.</p><p>However, it was extremely suitable for the ancient diabolism and was a peerless genius.</p><p>The ancient cultivation system was extremely difficult to cultivate. It was many times more difficult than the current cultivation system. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have gradually disappeared.</p><p>Moreover, it did not mean that one would be able to crush the current cultivation system and even defeat the Son of Heaven just by cultivating the primordial demonic path.</p><p>Only the most talented of them could reach the level of ancient devil.</p><p>“The immemorial cultivation system, the immemorial demonic Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had encountered and heard of the primordial cultivation system.</p><p>The heaven realm’s immemorial era was an era that was even earlier than the ancient era. At that time, the evil god race had not even started their attack. That was an extremely long time ago.</p><p>Lu Ming was really excited. He wondered if he should fight the ancient demon.</p><p>“Kid, you, come up!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was deep in thought, a voice was heard.</p><p>A young man from the immortal demon nation stepped onto the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, he was looking at Lu Ming!</p><p>This young man was the one who had defeated Luo Xuan before Lu Ming saved Luo Xuan and forced him to retreat with a single palm. His name was yuantuo.</p><p>Previously, he had been careless and was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s palm. He felt that he had lost face and had been feeling unhappy. He had been thinking about torturing Lu Ming once to regain his face.</p><p>Now that the competition was over, he finally found an opportunity to step onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“You, it’s you. Aren’t you very strong? didn’t you want to be the hero that saves the beauty? come up and fight me now. Let me see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>Yuan tuo stared at Lu Ming and shouted again.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was really smiling.</p><p>He had been looking for an opportunity to show off and attract the attention of the ancient Emperor. He also wanted to fight ancient devil.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming stepped into the fighting ring without any hesitation.</p><p>On the side of the eternal demon nation, some of them looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>This was because Luo Xuan had previously said that Lu Ming had defeated Gang Yan, but no one knew if it was true or not.</p><p>“Make your move, I’ll give you the chance to make your move!”</p><p>With one hand behind his back, Lu Ming spoke indifferently, his face contemptuous.</p><p>Of course, he did this on purpose.</p><p>As expected, yuantuo was furious.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yuan tuo shouted. He channeled all his strength and rushed toward Lu Ming with a whoosh, throwing a punch.</p><p>This punch was like a demonic bull galloping. It was like a sharp horn as it stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was very simple. He threw a punch.</p><p>However, he didn’t use any array Dao laws in this punch. Instead, he used the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>The power of the prison suppressing heaven art was completely contained in his fist as it collided with Yuan tuo’s fist.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The sky buzzed like a drum. Then, a figure flew back and fell heavily hundreds of meters away.</p><p>This figure was naturally Yuan tuo.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Originally, many of the people from the eternal devil nation had been dispirited after the defeat of the two sons of God. However, their eyes lit up at this moment.</p><p>To be able to defeat Yuan tuo in one move, this level of combat strength was not weak!</p><p>Could it really be as Luo Xuan had said, that Lu Ming had defeated Cang Yan?</p><p>Yuan tuo struggled to get up, his face flushed red.</p><p>He had challenged Lu Ming to defeat him and save his face.</p><p>He did not expect that he would be defeated by Lu Ming in one move and sent flying hundreds of meters away. He was completely crushed. He did not regain his face but instead, it was even more embarrassing.</p><p>He was filled with regret and was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“You … What’s your ranking in the eternal devil nation?”</p><p>Yuanto asked, gritting his teeth.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s ranking in the eternal devil nation was high, it would not be that embarrassing even if he lost.</p><p>“Nameless!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>He didn’t participate in the eternal devil Kingdom’s competition earlier, so he was indeed nameless.</p><p>However, when his words fell into the ears of the immortal demon nation’s paragons, they felt that Lu Ming was deliberately humiliating them.</p><p>A nameless person could defeat yuantuo?</p><p>Hmph, you’re trying to humiliate us in this way, right? let me test you!</p><p>A young man from the undying demon Kingdom shouted coldly. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring, standing opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people recognized him. He was ranked 15th in the immortal demon nation and had defeated a genius ranked 13th in the eternal demon nation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
