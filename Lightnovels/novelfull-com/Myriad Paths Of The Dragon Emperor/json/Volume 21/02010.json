However, in reality, there were definitely more than that.</p><p>It was normal for Lu Ming to have a great emperor behind him.</p><p>“Old man, it’s you!”</p><p>Emperor Tian Luo’s gaze focused slightly as he looked at uncle Kong.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the hall Master of the great Yan elixir Hall. I’ll kill you if you dare to touch him!”</p><p>Uncle Kong said slowly, but his voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Many people were shocked. This old man was really overbearing and powerful. Since the Emperor of tianluo wanted to kill Lu Ming, he would kill the Emperor of tianluo.</p><p>Could it be that this old man was that powerful?</p><p>“Kill me? Even if you were at your peak, you might not be able to defeat me. Now that you’re still injured, are you my match?”</p><p>Emperor tianluo sneered.</p><p>Back then, in the battle with the evil god tribe, in order to send the evil god tribe’s great emperor into the world gazing gate, a few great emperors had been injured.</p><p>Great emperor experts were protected by great DAOs, so it was usually difficult for them to be injured. However, once they were injured, it was very difficult to recover.</p><p>During this period of time, the Holy Emperor and the others were all in seclusion to heal. However, uncle Kong and Emperor formless ‘injuries hadn’t fully recovered in the past few months, and their battle-power wasn’t at their peak. This was why the Emperor of tianluo had said this.</p><p>despicable! The few emperors were injured in the battle with the evil god tribe, but they’re here to take advantage of us!</p><p>Desolate li couldn’t help but shout angrily. Emperor tianluo’s gaze turned to desolate li and a cold light flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Desolate li was fearless as he glared at Emperor tianluo.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Uncle Kong didn’t say anything more. He directly unsheathed his sword and it howled through the nine Heavens. At this moment, uncle Kong revealed a peerless sharpness. He turned from a bearded old man into a peerless swordsman.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Emperor of tianluo didn’t dare to be careless in front of uncle Kong, even though he was injured. He circulated his power to the extreme, and a huge seal floated above his head.</p><p>“I’m afraid the two of you can’t save Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. A figure was floating above the heads of the he family experts.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled!</p><p>He was the great emperor of the he clan!</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan had indeed appeared.</p><p>The experts from the three Emperor-level forces were three emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming was really finished today.</p><p>The great emperor formless and the nameless great emperor. Lu Ming’s side had two great emperors, but they definitely couldn’t stop the other side’s three great emperors. Moreover, there were so many experts from the three major forces.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, if the great emperor did not come to his aid, he would be dead for sure.</p><p>Many people sighed!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Emperor notionless erupted with an extremely powerful aura. However, Emperor Heng also erupted with his aura and locked onto Emperor notionless, preventing him from helping Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re great emperors, yet you still need several people to work together against a junior. You’re really disgracing great emperors!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Lu Ming has to pay the price for sowing discord. Also, today, dealing with Lu Ming is secondary. There’s one more thing 1 want to tell you, Wu Xiang!”</p><p>from now on, the heavenly Emperor City belongs to the he clan, the Heng clan, and the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Wu Xiang, you’d better leave the heavenly Emperor City!</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan said coldly.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were furious when they heard this, especially Lu Ming and the others from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. They were furious.</p><p>The Heng clan and the he clan wanted to take the yuan mountain sacred Academy for themselves. The word “despicable” simply couldn’t be used to describe their actions.</p><p>hahaha, what Bullsh * t Emperor? 1 think you are just a few old dogs, shameless old dogs!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and burst out laughing.</p><p>Hearing this, the three emperors narrowed their eyes and looked at Lu Ming with sharp eyes.</p><p>The other people from the three forces were furious.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you just say?”</p><p>“You dare to insult the great emperor? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The other members of the he and Heng families roared.</p><p>“Am I wrong? The way 1 see it, the three emperors from your three clans are even inferior to the evil god race!”</p><p>in order to protect the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the three great emperors and a few other great emperors risked their lives and fought a bloody battle. The fate of great emperor Tian Huo and great emperor hun Tian is unknown. The other great emperors were injured because of this, but you guys took advantage of the situation!</p><p>not only are you afraid of death, but you also want to seize the territory of those who fought a bloody battle with the evil god tribe. What are you if not dogs? No, I was wrong. Even dogs are loyal. It’s an insult to dogs to describe you as dogs!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered continuously. He only felt a ball of fire burning in his chest.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with anger, while the people from the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect glared at Lu Ming with red faces.</p><p>“Hmph, you speak so righteously, as if you’ve also made a great contribution!” Lu Ming, what are you doing now that the evil god tribe is invading?”</p><p>A young man from the he and Heng families couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>I’ve fought a bloody battle with the evil god tribe!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Fighting a bloody battle is a nice way to put it, but it’s just an opportunity to kill a few random soldiers. What’s the use of it for the overall situation? Don’t put yourself so high!”</p><p>A young man from the he family mocked.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s true that like ancestors, like descendants!”</p><p>At this moment, Emperor formless laughed coldly with a hint of mockery. Then, his voice suddenly rose, then, I’ll tell you what Lu Ming did in the war with the evil god tribe today.</p><p>Lu Ming was the one who sealed the void passageway that the evil god tribe opened!</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice was loud and clear. Like a gust of wind, it blew in all directions and spread throughout the entire heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming is the one who sealed the void channel. How is that possible?”</p><p>“How is it possible with Lu Ming’s cultivation!”</p><p>Many people had incredulous expressions on their faces.</p><p>that’s impossible. You’re clearly trying to elevate Lu Ming’s status on purpose!</p><p>“With Lu Ming’s cultivation level, how is it possible? Who would believe such a thing?”</p><p>Someone from the Heng family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect immediately retorted the Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming used the chaos laws to revive an ancient chaos stone disc. In the battle to seal the void passageway, it was us who helped Lu Ming and finally succeeded in sealing the void passageway!</p><p>“I swear in the name of the great emperor that this matter is absolutely true. If it wasn’t for Lu Ming, the yuan mountain would still be in the midst of war. And now, they want to kill those who have contributed. Are you all going to do nothing?”</p><p>Emperor formless’s voice spread throughout heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>He didn’t say this to the Heng family, the he family, or the Daluo heaven sect, but to the other people in the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The gazes of many people changed.</p><p>Emperor formless spoke in the name of a great emperor, so there was no way he was wrong.</p><p>He didn’t expect that so many things had happened behind the scenes during the decisive battle.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the greatest contributor was actually Lu Ming, but Lu Ming had never brought this up to talk about. If it weren’t for the three major forces forcing him to reveal the truth today, no one would have known.</p><p>And now, the three great factions were going to kill the evil god race’s greatest contributor to the war.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Some people flashed and appeared behind Lu Ming and the rest, releasing powerful auras..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
