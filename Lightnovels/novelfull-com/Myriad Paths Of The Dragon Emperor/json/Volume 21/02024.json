He was very famous in the youluo devil Kingdom. He was the young master of the youluo devil Kingdom’s Grand Marshal. His name was Ji Peng, and his name was well-known throughout the entire youluo devil Kingdom!</p><p>In the youluo demonic kingdom, apart from a few King physiques, Ji Peng was considered a top heaven’s favorite among the younger generation.</p><p>In the past, someone had made a ranking list of the ten strongest heaven’s favorites in the youluo demonic kingdom, excluding the king physique.</p><p>Ji Peng was ranked ninth among the ten great heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Of course, with the addition of the king physique, Ji Peng would be ranked a dozen or so behind, but it was still no small matter.</p><p>But now, Ji Peng was defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was definitely shocking.</p><p>“Who is this person? He looks very young, but he has such battle prowess, even stronger than Ji Peng. Could it be that he has a King physique?”</p><p>it’s not a King body. When this person attacked just now, there was a flash of demonic lightning. It should be a demonic lightning law, not a King body!</p><p>“In the youluo demonic kingdom, other than the king physique, this person can be ranked in the top ten, or even top eight!”</p><p>Some of the onlookers were discussing in low voices.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming did not use the chaos law or the array Dao law. Instead, he used the chaos law to transform into the demonic lightning law and covered the Saint energy with the demonic lightning law, making him look like a demonic cultivator.</p><p>The eldest Princess looked at Lu Ming in surprise. Lu Ming’s abilities were stronger than she had imagined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Ji Peng flipped over and stood up. His body exploded with cold killing intent as he roared,”Brat, I didn’t use my full strength just now. If you do it again, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Ji Peng roared, and his aura became even more violent.</p><p>He had been too careless and did not use his full strength. He did not even use his sacred art, which was why he was sent flying by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had already shown mercy, but the other party did not know when to retreat. In that case, he could not be blamed for being impolite.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>“Alright, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, the eldest princess’s voice rang out, causing Ji Peng’s body to freeze.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, this person is extremely daring. He even dares to hit the princess’s people. Let me cripple him!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s eyes were cold. He did not want to let Lu Ming off.</p><p>“He didn’t use his full strength just now. If we really fight, you may not be his match. Both of you will only suffer. You guys leave first. I have something to ask him!”</p><p>The eldest Princess said.</p><p>eldest Princess, if you let us leave, what if this brat makes a move …</p><p>An old man said worriedly.</p><p>“You think he can hurt me?”</p><p>The eldest Princess retorted.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The others didn’t say anything. With the eldest princess’s strength, how could this person hurt her?</p><p>“Then take care, eldest Princess!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s eyes flickered. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, you’re lucky today. I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>Then, he left with the others.</p><p>“Farewell!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and turned to leave.</p><p>He instinctively felt that this first princess was not a kind person, and he was too lazy to be associated with her.</p><p>“Why are you in such a hurry to leave?”</p><p>The eldest Princess moved like a ray of light, light as if she was weightless, and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and shot into the sky. The eldest Princess did the same and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and asked with a frown.</p><p>“You’re quite strong. 1 could sense that even if Ji Peng had fought you with all his strength, he wouldn’t have been your opponent. Come to me and be my guest elder!”</p><p>The eldest Princess spoke, her expression still carrying a trace of cold arrogance and superiority.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>“I won’t let you be my guest forever. As long as you work for me for the next three months, you can leave!”</p><p>The eldest Princess continued to speak, but Lu Ming had no intention of stopping.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the eldest princess’s eyes. If not for the fact that she was in urgent need of talents recently and Lu Ming dared to treat her with such an attitude, she would have already taken action.</p><p>1 won’t let you do anything dangerous. As long as you help me fight against the heaven’s favorite of the youluo Empire one month later, it’ll be fine. Whatever conditions you have, just state them!</p><p>The eldest Princess continued to follow as she spoke.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly stopped. He looked at the eldest Princess and said,”I can state any condition?”</p><p>“As long as it’s not too much, you can mention it!”</p><p>The eldest Princess said.</p><p>1 wish to get to know someone from the imperial family of the eternal devil nation. Are you able to introduce me to them? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If the other party could introduce him to someone from the imperial family of the eternal devil nation, it would save him a lot of trouble. He could agree to it for now.</p><p>Moreover, the other party was only going to be her guest elder for three months and only to compete with the geniuses of the youluo Empire. This was not a big deal to Lu Ming. There was no harm in agreeing to it.</p><p>hehehe, and here 1 thought it was something big. Not long ago, the king of the eternal devil nation has just transcended another great Tribulation of the heavens and earth. Three months from now, he’s going to hold a grand banquet for the entire world. Countless devil nations will be there to celebrate, including my you Luo devil nation. I’ll naturally be able to introduce you to him then!</p><p>The eldest Princess said.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed!</p><p>The king of the ancient devil nation had just survived a great calamity and was going to hold a feast. This was a great opportunity for Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, I’ll agree to be your guest elder, but I’ll only be your guest elder for three months. If you ask me to deal with a Martial Emperor powerhouse or something, I’ll have to refuse!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t worry. Why would I ask you to go against a Martial Emperor? ”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the eldest Princess smiled.</p><p>“Take this guest elder token!”</p><p>A token appeared in the eldest princess’s hand and she threw it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming reached out to take it and put it away.</p><p>“Come back to the princess’s Manor with me now. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay!” He said.</p><p>The eldest Princess said. Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The princess’s Manor was very spacious and had many palaces.</p><p>The eldest Princess had arranged a courtyard for Lu Ming. It was very big and quiet.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming also found out the eldest Princess ‘name. She was called you ning!</p><p>The eldest Princess left after arranging a place for Lu Ming to stay.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming secretly asked around and found out a lot of things.</p><p>It turned out that the youluo demonic kingdom was founded by two demonic Dao clans.</p><p>However, the question of which family would be in charge of the youluo demonic kingdom after the founding of the kingdom remained.</p><p>The later rules stated that every ten thousand years, the two families would send out their young geniuses to compete. The winner would continue to rule the youluo demonic kingdom for another ten thousand years.</p><p>The eldest Princess, you ning, belonged to the you family.</p><p>The you family had been in control of the youluo devil Kingdom for 20000 years. In another month, the once-in-ten-thousand-years cycle would begin again. The prodigies of the two families would compete to decide which family would be in control of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>Therefore, during this period of time, eldest Princess you ning had been secretly gathering geniuses to increase her strength.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why you ning wanted him to be a guest elder. It was for this reason..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
