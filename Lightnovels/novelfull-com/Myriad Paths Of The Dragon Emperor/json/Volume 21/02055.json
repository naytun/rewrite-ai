From the outside, the large buildings in the city were hazy and could not be seen clearly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Behind them, the black-robed middle-aged man continued to blast away Mo Ling and chased after them. Lu Ming did not stop and rushed into the ancient city.</p><p>However, the moment he rushed into the ancient city, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He couldn’t fly in the ancient city.</p><p>The ancient city forbade flying, and there was a mysterious power that prevented him from flying.</p><p>Moreover, the light in the city was indeed very dim and the visibility was not high. With Lu Ming’s eyesight, he could not see very far.</p><p>In the city, there were many huge palaces and all kinds of ancient buildings. They were tall and majestic, like behemoths standing in the ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into a small alley. He ran wildly in the small alley and then turned to another small alley.</p><p>There were countless streets and alleys in the ancient city. After making a few turns, Lu Ming was already far away from the city gate.</p><p>At the same time, the black-robed middle-aged man had also rushed into the ancient city with his men.</p><p>As soon as they entered the ancient city, their expressions changed because they felt that they couldn’t fly.</p><p>there might be opportunities in this ancient city. Let’s look for Lu Ming while looking for opportunities!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with a hint of greed.</p><p>Then, he asked two Emperor-to-be to guard the city gate. If they found Lu Ming, they would inform him immediately. He took the rest of the</p><p>Emperor-to-be and chose a random street and ran.</p><p>At this moment, two more people arrived outside the ancient city.</p><p>These were two old men with exceptionally powerful auras. They were both powerhouses of the empty Emperor realm.</p><p>After the Emperor-to-be who had stayed outside to provide support briefly explained the situation, the two void emperors also rushed toward the ancient city.</p><p>Although there were Martial Emperor realm demon spirits among the demon spirits, the two of them were focused on charging forward and did not linger on the battle. The illusionary Emperor demon spirits could not stop them. After a while, they also rushed into the ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around the ancient city, bypassing many ancient and strange buildings.</p><p>In the city, it was silent and abnormally quiet. It was empty, without a single living being.</p><p>“What’s in these buildings?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. He rushed to the wall of a building and looked inside.</p><p>The inside of the building was also empty, with nothing inside.</p><p>It was an empty city.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at a few buildings consecutively. They were all empty.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He saw the door of a Hall in front of him, which was ajar.</p><p>The doors of the other buildings were all closed, except for this Palace.</p><p>could it have been opened by those people from the eternal demon nation?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The bunch from the ancient devil nation must have entered as well. It wasn’t surprising that they were the ones who opened the door.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and approached the door, looking inside.</p><p>His pupils suddenly constricted when he took a look.</p><p>There was a small courtyard in the palace. In the courtyard, there was a figure.</p><p>This figure was sitting cross-legged, wearing armor, but under the armor, there was a skeleton.</p><p>The armor was rusty and had dark red blood stains.</p><p>It seemed that he was an ancient person who had fallen for a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming observed for a while and left the place, continuing to walk through the ancient city.</p><p>He pondered if he should return to the city gate and leave the ancient city.</p><p>He didn’t know why, but he had a bad feeling. He felt that this ancient city was very strange.</p><p>After turning around for a while, seven or eight figures suddenly flashed at the end of the street in front of them. They were the black-robed middle-aged man and the emperors-to-be.</p><p>The other party also saw Lu Ming at a glance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where do you think you are going now?”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said coldly as he chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and ran towards another street.</p><p>The middle-aged man in the black robe was in hot pursuit. They had explored a few ancient buildings in succession but did not find anything. There was no opportunity that they had imagined. Therefore, Lu Ming could not let it go.</p><p>At the very least, if they killed Lu Ming, they would be rewarded handsomely by the Cang Demon King.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had turned two streets. However, at this moment, two more figures appeared in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed when he saw the two of them. Their auras were extremely terrifying. They were also martial emperors.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When the two of them saw Lu Ming, their eyes flashed with killing intent and they charged at him.</p><p>“Haha, stop Lu Ming!”</p><p>The black-robed man laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. It seemed that the Azure Demon King really wanted to kill him. He had actually secretly allied with so many people.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming could not stop to fight with the other party. The other party had three void emperors. Once he was entangled, he would definitely die.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure changed and he dashed out from the right side of the street.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely shrill scream reverberated through the silent ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and took a quick glance. He immediately felt a little scared.</p><p>He saw an Emperor-to-be who was chasing after him. He was at the back of the group and was covered in armor.</p><p>It was a rusty armor with dark blood stains. The Emperor-to-be’s body was quickly shriveling up as if his blood essence had been devoured.</p><p>“What the hell is this? get lost!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man roared as he waved his hand, and a black demonic blade slashed at the armor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out as the demonic blade struck the armor, but there was not a single mark on the armor.</p><p>As for the Emperor-to-be, he had stopped screaming and turned into a skeleton.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man was furious, and he attacked the armor with all kinds of attacks.</p><p>However, the armor flickered and rushed into a building. By the time they entered the building, the armor was gone.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s and the others “faces turned gloomy.</p><p>“Continue to chase after Lu Ming!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man bellowed in anger. They continued to chase in the direction that Lu Ming had escaped.</p><p>However, it didn’t take long before another scream was heard.</p><p>That armor came out of nowhere and entangled another Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man and the others launched a storm of attacks. All kinds of attacks landed on the armor, making clanking sounds. In the end, they flashed and rushed into another building.</p><p>The armor ate people!</p><p>Everyone was scared. What was going on? It was just a piece of armor, but it had rushed out repeatedly and devoured people’s blood essence. An Emperor-to-be had no power to resist.</p><p>This was too horrifying.</p><p>The faces of the remaining emperors-to-be turned pale.</p><p>the Emperor-to-be will walk in the middle. The three of us will guard the periphery!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said. He let the Emperor-to-be walk in the middle and the three void emperors guard the periphery.</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming also heard the screams and felt a little scared.</p><p>A piece of armor actually ate people.</p><p>More importantly, Lu Ming felt that this armor looked very familiar. It was exactly the same as the armor on a corpse that he had seen in the courtyard.</p><p>Could it be that armor?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
