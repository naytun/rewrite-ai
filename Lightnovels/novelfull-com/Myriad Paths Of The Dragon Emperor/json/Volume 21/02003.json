Their methods were so cruel that it made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>“Damned evil god tribe! Kill, kill, I’ll definitely kill all these bastards!”</p><p>Desolate li roared.</p><p>There was no room for reconciliation between them and the evil god race. When both sides met, they could only kill.</p><p>Either you die, or I die!</p><p>“Wei Xian, can you continue tracking?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath to calm himself down and asked.</p><p>the evil god tribe is very cunning. They massacred an entire city and collected a large amount of blood. They even split up into a few paths and scattered blood along the way to deceive us. However, they still underestimated me!</p><p>“As long as I have some time, I can find the right direction!”</p><p>Wei Xian said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The group went around the town. Wei Xian sensed carefully. After a moment, he pointed to the left and took the lead. The group followed.</p><p>This time, another half a day had passed, and they arrived at the entrance of a Hidden Valley.</p><p>This place was filled with mountains, one after another, as if there was no end to them. If one were to hide here, it would be difficult to find them unless one had a powerful tracking technique.</p><p>the evil god tribe is in this Valley!</p><p>Wei Xian said.</p><p>“Alright, Wei Xian, you guys guard the entrance of the valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Wei Xian and a few other desolate race members with weaker cultivation.</p><p>can I join the battle? the Alliance master is my idol!</p><p>Wei Xian said.</p><p>Two months ago, he took the initiative to look for Lu Ming and the rest. The moment he saw Lu Ming, he said that Lu Ming was his idol.</p><p>He had joined the Dragon Alliance because of this.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was rather speechless. However, during this period of time, Wei Xian had integrated into the team and gained everyone’s recognition.</p><p>However, Wei Xian’s cultivation was still a little low. He had just broken through to the great saint realm and Lu Ming did not want him to take the risk, your task of guarding the entrance of the valley is also very important. If there are any fish that escape, you will be responsible for sniping them!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wei Xian was helpless. He knew that his cultivation level was weak and he might drag Lu Ming and the rest down if he followed them in. Hence, he nodded and stayed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Huang Li, Huang Ling, Long Chen, Luo Xiang, Ouyang Wushuang, Luo Tianyi, and bubbles concealed their auras and walked into the valley.</p><p>In the valley, there were at least a few dozen members of the evil god tribe gathered together. Some of them were recuperating while others were cultivating.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>The evil god tribe was very sharp. They had discovered Lu Ming and the rest the moment they entered the valley.</p><p>The dozens of evil god tribe members released their auras at the same time and swept their gazes over to Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Those young men, kill them!”</p><p>When some of the evil god race members saw that Lu Ming and the others were just a bunch of youths, they immediately roared. Destructive light burst forth from their third eye as they charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>At the same time, the third eyes of the other members of the evil god race shot out beams of destructive light that were extremely powerful.</p><p>The people of the evil god race who could escape here were all experts. They were at least absolute Saints, and most of them were emperors-to-be.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming and the others shouted and attacked, destroying the beams of destructive light and heading toward the evil god race.</p><p>After such a long period of fighting, the abilities of Lu Ming and the rest had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Almost every one of them had the strength to fight or even kill an ordinary Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles ‘combat strength was even more shocking. With a wave of their hands, an Emperor-to-be was killed.</p><p>In an instant, more than ten members of the evil god race were killed by them.</p><p>The remaining members of the evil god race had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. They knew that they had encountered a terrifying genius.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Some of the evil god tribe members roared and wanted to retreat into the depths of the valley.</p><p>“Bubble, stop them!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Watch me, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles pressed down with her small hands, causing the void to fluctuate. The space formed into many shields that enveloped the evil god tribe.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The evil god race’s attacks slammed onto the spatial shield. They wanted to rush out, but they were unable to break it at all.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the rest arrived and killed the evil god race members one by one.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the depths of the valley, causing the entire Valley to shake.</p><p>A vast pressure spread out from the depths of the valley.</p><p>That was Emperor pressure!</p><p>There was actually a great emperor from the evil god race in the valley. No wonder those from the evil god race had wanted to rush into the depths of the valley.</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the rest turned grave.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to point out the chaos finger tribulation. One after another, finger forces shot out and killed all the remaining evil god race members.</p><p>In the next moment, a strong gust of wind blew. A tall and burly member of the evil god race charged out and landed heavily on the ground. A vast pressure pressed down on Lu Ming and the others, as heavy as mountains.</p><p>This was a genuine Emperor, but it seemed that he was only a void Emperor.</p><p>“He’s injured!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Indeed, half of the evil god race member’s body had exploded, and there was a layer of flames burning on the wound. It let out sizzling sounds and prevented the evil god race member from recovering.</p><p>Clearly, this evil god race member had fled here with severe injuries and was recuperating here.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest did not dare to be careless. Even an injured Martial Emperor was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“Even if I’m injured, it’s enough to kill you all. Kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s illusory Thearch shouted as a destructive light shot out from the third eye between his brows.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger with all his might. A huge finger collided with the other party’s destructive light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the chaotic finger of tribulation was destroyed, but the destructive light was also blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated. He felt his qi and blood surging.</p><p>the Martial Emperor realm is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, killing an Emperor-to-be would be a piece of cake. However, he was at a disadvantage after exchanging a blow with his opponent.</p><p>A Martial Emperor was too powerful. He had already cultivated the power of the world and had unparalleled attack power. There was a huge difference between an Emperor-to-be and a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, but he did not know that the other party was even more shocked.</p><p>It was unbelievable that an absolute Saint could block one of his moves.</p><p>Martial sovereigns were high and mighty and had endless lifespans. In some places, they were called immortal.</p><p>When faced with a martial Supreme, anyone below the rank of a martial Supreme would not be able to resist at all. They could be killed with a thought.</p><p>But now, an absolute Saint, who wasn’t even an Emperor-to-be, was able to block his attack without being injured. This was too terrifying..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
