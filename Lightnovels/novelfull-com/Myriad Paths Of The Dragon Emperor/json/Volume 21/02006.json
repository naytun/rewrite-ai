This is too despicable!</p><p>Desolate li had a bad temper and couldn’t help but roar.</p><p>The others ‘eyes were also filled with anger.</p><p>Some of the people wanted to resist but were killed immediately. Their abilities were limited and they couldn’t manage it.</p><p>“Not good, the Wei family is in danger!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Almost all of the great emperors in the Wei clan were dead, and only a few were left to rebuild the clan. There were no experts at all. The Wei clan’s mansion and other resources would definitely be targeted by the Heng and he clans.</p><p>Wei Xian had just returned and was probably in danger. Thinking of this, the others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>“Let’s go to the Wei family!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and flew toward the Wei family, followed by the rest.</p><p>At this moment, the Wei family was indeed facing a disaster, and the he family had their eyes on this place.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An absolute Saint of the Wei family was killed by an Emperor-to-be of the he family. His body fell to the ground.</p><p>“Today, you have to agree even if you don’t want to. Otherwise, you will die!”</p><p>A he clan Emperor-to-be sneered and looked down at the remaining Wei clan members.</p><p>There were only a little more than a hundred people left in the Wei family. The strongest one was only at the Emperor-to-be realm. It was impossible for them to compete with the he family.</p><p>your family is despicable. You were afraid of death in the previous war and didn’t dare to fight. What kind of Emperor-level force are you? you’re worse than a dog’s fart!</p><p>Wei Xian had also returned to the Wei family. At this moment, he roared with anger.</p><p>brat, you dare to insult my he family and the great emperor of the he family. You will have a miserable ending. 1 promise!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the he clan walked toward Wei Xian with a cold look.</p><p>I’m from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. You guys dare to touch me!</p><p>Wei Xian said.</p><p>“So what if you are from the yuan mountain sacred Academy? Kill him!”</p><p>The he clan’s Emperor-to-be shouted coldly as he charged towards Wei Xian, let’s go, Wei Xian. I’ll stop them!</p><p>A white-haired elder from the Wei clan roared and charged towards the he clan quasi-Emperor.</p><p>old dog, you still dare to resist? in that case, the Wei clan doesn’t need to remain in this world anymore. Kill them without mercy!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be of the he family gave the order.</p><p>There were more than a dozen emperors-to-be and dozens of absolute Saints from the he family. They were far more powerful than the remaining forces of the Wei family.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Heng family experts moved. A dozen Emperor-to-be and a dozen absolute Saints charged toward the Wei family.</p><p>There were only five or six emperors-to-be left in the Wei family. The others were all absolute Saints or below, so they couldn’t resist the attack of the he family.</p><p>Immediately, the Wei clansmen were killed one by one, and their screams rose and fell.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>die! seeing the Wei clan members being killed one by one, Wei Xian roared with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there were only a few Emperor-to-be left in the Wei family, who were still resisting desperately.</p><p>However, facing the siege of more than a dozen Emperor-to-be from the he family, they were doomed.</p><p>In a short while, all the emperors-to-be of the Wei clan were killed, leaving only Wei Xian.</p><p>This was the other party’s intention. Otherwise, Wei Xian would have been dead long ago.</p><p>“Your Jia clan will die a terrible death!”</p><p>Wei Xian roared, his eyes turning red from anger.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the he family slapped Wei Xian’s face and sent him flying into the ruins of the Wei family.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of he clan moved and appeared beside Wei Xian, stepping on him.</p><p>“So what if he’s someone from the yuan mountain sacred Academy? You’re still like a dead dog under my feet, haha!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the he clan laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“You’d better move your foot away. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death!”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely cold voice came from the distance. Then, a dozen figures flashed and appeared not far away.</p><p>The dozen of people were Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Alliance master!”</p><p>Wei Xian bellowed when he saw Lu Ming. His eyes were filled with hope.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone in the he family recognized Lu Ming and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>The other members of the he family also changed their expressions abruptly.</p><p>In the world of the lotus flower, Lu Ming had made a name for himself. Even the eternal Star River had been defeated by him. There was no one below the martial Supreme who was not afraid of him.</p><p>“I said, move your foot away, did you not hear me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he glanced at the he family’s Emperor-to-be who was stepping on Wei Xian. Step by step, he walked toward him.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the he clan said with a serious look,” “Lu Ming, this is the he family’s business. You’d better not meddle in other people’s business!”</p><p>“It seems like you want to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. As soon as he finished speaking, a transparent bubble enveloped the he family’s Emperor-to-be and his body stiffened.</p><p>The Saint energy in Lu Ming’s hands surged and condensed into a long spear.</p><p>The long spear was covered with formation Dao destruction runes.</p><p>“No, stop!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be from the he clan panicked and screamed in fear. At the same time, he struggled with all his might, but it was in vain.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and the long spear shot out like lightning, piercing through the other party’s head. It carried the other party’s body and flew tens of thousands of meters away, nailing him to the ground.</p><p>“Don’t let a single one of these people off!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve long wanted to take action!”</p><p>Desolate Li’s eyes turned cold as he charged towards the experts of the he family.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others also attacked the he family.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve already offended the Heng family. It won’t do you any good to offend the he family!</p><p>An expert of the he family shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and threw a punch. The force of the punch crushed a he clan Emperor-to-be into pieces.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, these people from the he family were all scumbags who deserved to die.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The he family’s experts roared. They knew that they were no match for Lu Ming. Their figures flickered and they dashed in all directions, trying to escape.</p><p>However, they didn’t get very far before they seemed to have hit an invisible wall and were all blocked.</p><p>Bubbles made a move and sealed the space.</p><p>Lu Ming, the he family’s powerhouses have all returned to heavenly Emperor City. There are many Emperor-level powerhouses nearby. If you kill us, you will die too!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be of the he clan shouted.</p><p>“Finish the battle quickly!”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s response. With a wave of his hand, nine illusionary pieces of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and pressed down. The he family powerhouses were killed one after another.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles and the others also made their moves.</p><p>It was a complete suppression!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, only a few of the dozens of he family experts were left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’ve already sent out the news that you’re dead for sure!”</p><p>The last he family Emperor-to-be roared and was killed by Lu Ming with one punch.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the yuan mountain sacred Academy!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and Saint energy surged. He wrapped Wei Xian up and flew towards the yuan mountain Saint Academy at the fastest speed.</p><p>Not long after they left, a few figures appeared in the sky above the Wei clan, exuding an extremely powerful aura.</p><p>The figures were all Martial Emperor realm powerhouses. Obviously, they were the he clan’s powerhouses.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>“Report to the higher-ups, this time, we must kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>A few cold and indifferent voices rang out. Then, they left..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
