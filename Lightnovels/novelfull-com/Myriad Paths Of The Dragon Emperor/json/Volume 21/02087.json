When the prodigies of Yuan mountain arrived ar the divine destiny land, he began to investigate. He wanted to know Lu Ming’s whereabouts so that he could deal with him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did nor arrive. Instead, he found out that Lu Ming had a few friends and he immediately sent people to arrest them.</p><p>It was just a precaution, but he didn’t expect it to be useful.</p><p>“There are two people who can control rhe laws of extremity. One is called Long Chen and the other is called desolate power. They are both in the MU family. Haha, Lu Ming, come with me to the MU family and hand over the chaos Scripture!11</p><p>Mu yang laughed and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>The killing intent in his heart was extremely cold.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had defeated him in public. To him, it was a great humiliation. As long as Lu Ming set foot in the MU family, he would make Lu Ming regret it.</p><p>“You, should die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His eyes were icy cold as he stared at Mu yang.</p><p>At this moment, his killing intent was extremely dense.</p><p>It seemed that Long Chen and the desolate power had indeed fallen into Mu Yang’s hands.</p><p>“You still dare to threaten me at this point?’”</p><p>Mu Yang’s face darkened.</p><p>I said you’re stupid, and you’re really stupid. You shouldn’t have said it here and now!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What do you want?” Mu Yang’s face changed dramatically.</p><p>At the same time, he tried to retreat but it was too late. Lu Ming’s body was like a bolt of lightning, rushing towards Muyang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had integrated the law of devouring into it, and his combat strength was even stronger.</p><p>With one move, Mu Yang’s arms exploded, turning into flesh and blood that splattered everywhere. The terrifying power directly pierced through Mu Yang’s protective light of law and his body, revealing a bright hole in the front and back.</p><p>Mu yang fell to the ground and screamed.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming rushed over and stepped on Mu Yang’s legs, breaking them.</p><p>Mu yang screamed hysterically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Mu yang roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming stepped on Mu Yang’s face, almost crushing his head. He spat out a mouthful of blood and almost lost all his teeth.</p><p>“Tell your people to bring my friend here in exchange for you. If my friend loses even a single hair. I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You … You dare?”</p><p>Mu yang roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on his face again, causing Muyang to scream in pain.</p><p>At this moment. Mu yang was filled with regret. He was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He should not have said that he had captured Long Chen and desolate power in the fighting ring. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so decisive.</p><p>The main thing was that the force behind him was too powerful. Therefore, he subconsciously thought that Lu Ming would not dare to do anything to him.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s friend was in his hands. He thought that he had everything under control, but he did not expect that Lu Ming could take him down directly.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming was too decisive. He had thought of a way to save people in an instant. Ordinary people would definitely not think of it and would not be so decisive.</p><p>Many people around the fighting ring looked at each other.</p><p>Because some of Muyang’s words had been transmitted to them, they did not know the whole story and were very confused.</p><p>He did not understand why Lu Ming suddenly went crazy and tortured Muyang so badly.</p><p>“How dare you! Release young master Muyang!”</p><p>kid, don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you’re the son of chaos. If you offend the MU family, you’ll die without a burial place!</p><p>A few of the MU clan’s powerhouses roared as a terrifying aura erupted from their bodies. They were all martial emperors.</p><p>“If you guys continue to talk nonsense, I’ll cut him down!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes swept coldly across the martial Supremes as he spoke. His voice was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>The MU clan martial sovereigns all shut up.</p><p>Mu yang was the number one genius of the MU family. He had unparalleled talent. Nothing could happen to him.</p><p>“Hurry up and bring my friend over.”</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his head and looked down at Muyang.</p><p>At this moment. Mu yang was being stepped on by Lu Ming. He was humiliated. If there was a crack in the fighting ring, he would have found one and crawled in.</p><p>He was rhe son of the void, a proud Son of Heaven who was about to break through to the martial Supreme realm. He was known as one of the strongest seeds in this ten lands battle. However, at this moment, he was being stepped on mercilessly by Lu Ming. He really could not bear it.</p><p>However, the cold killing intent on Lu Ming’s body told him that Lu Ming would really kill him.</p><p>‘Go and bring the people!”</p><p>Finally, Mu yang shouted and asked the MU family’s experts to bring the people back.</p><p>A few of the MU clan experts had ugly expressions, but they still left in the end and flew toward the MU clan.</p><p>The MU family’s headquarters was in Aeon city.</p><p>“It seems that Muyang has captured Lu Ming’s friend!”</p><p>From the conversation between Lu Ming and Muyang, many people could tell what was going on.</p><p>No wonder Lu Ming was suddenly furious.</p><p>At the same time, everyone was even more shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was too powerful. It had reached a shocking level.</p><p>“Is his cultivation really still in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage? He didn’t break through to the Emperor-to-be realm?”</p><p>Some people said in disbelief.</p><p>the laws haven’t formed a River yet. He’s indeed in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm!</p><p>An expert spoke up and confirmed Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>This made people gasp.</p><p>Lu Ming s physical body is extremely strong, far stronger than the average child of God. I’m guessing that he must have had a heaven-defying encounter that caused his physical body to be so strong that it’s shocking. His combat strength has also been greatly improved!</p><p>An elder spoke. They could tell what was going on.</p><p>although his physical body is strong, his nomological laws are even more terrifying. He’s strong in all aspects and has almost no weaknesses!</p><p>Another elder spoke.</p><p>“What a monster!”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>it is fortunate that his cultivation is low. If his cultivation was high, who would be his match in this battle of the ten lands? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. Don’t forget that the child of destiny has been born in this generation!</p><p>These words shocked many people.</p><p>Yes, Destiny’s Child!</p><p>This was undoubtedly an extremely terrifying figure, a truly invincible figure.</p><p>also, the ancient cultivation system has appeared. Someone has cultivated it to a terrifying level!</p><p>also, Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, is said to be in seclusion to break through to the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Following that, someone else spoke up, causing everyone’s heart to tremble once again.</p><p>Some of the sons of God had extremely serious expressions.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands this time would probably be extremely intense and would become a shocking event.</p><p>Lu Ming did not wait for long. In less than half an hour, a group of people flew over.</p><p>They were the experts of the MU family. They were flying over with two young men.</p><p>“LongChen, desolate power!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The two young men were long Chen and desolate.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Long Chen and desolate li were shocked when they saw Lu Ming. They knew what had happened when they saw Lu Ming stepping on Mu yang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what you’re doing is too dangerous!”</p><p>Long Chen sighed, his eyes solemn.</p><p>“We’re friends!”</p><p>Long Chen and desolate power shut up after hearing Lu Ming s words..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
