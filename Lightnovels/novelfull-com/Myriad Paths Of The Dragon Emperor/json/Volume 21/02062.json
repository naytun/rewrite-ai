He could not help but be overjoyed.</p><p>Although he didn’t understand how his physical body was Reforged, it was a good thing.</p><p>“No, my Saint heart!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally realized that something was wrong with his Saint heart.</p><p>There had been two Saint hearts before, but now it had become one. It was just that this Saint heart was larger.</p><p>could it be that the two Saint hearts have fused together? ”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed and was extremely surprised.</p><p>He had never thought that the two Saint hearts cultivated by the Twin forbidden spell could actually merge together.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming realized that not only had he Reforged his physical body, but his cultivation had also improved. He had reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Not only that, but Lu Ming also realized that after the two Saint hearts had merged, his two types of laws had also completely merged together.</p><p>Previously, the array Dao laws and chaos laws were only at the initial stage of fusion. Now, they were completely fused.</p><p>“The complete fusion of the two laws will definitely increase the power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>This time, it was really a blessing in disguise.</p><p>Not only did he not die, but he had also made a breakthrough in his cultivation. His physical strength had also increased greatly, and the two types of nomological laws had fused.</p><p>He had heard that Martial Emperor powerhouses had to take this step.</p><p>Martial sovereigns had to comprehend different laws before they could merge them together.</p><p>He was already doing what a Martial Emperor would do.</p><p>“If the Azure Demon King knew about this, he would probably be angered to death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Then, with a thought, the mountain and river diagram and the Dayan elixir furnace returned to his consciousness.</p><p>the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and the third bloodline are still there!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and the third bloodline. He was surprised to find that they were still there.</p><p>He had never been able to understand these two bloodlines, but he felt that they were very wondrous.</p><p>This time, even his physical body was destroyed. After reforging, the two bloodlines were still there. This was really hard to explain. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>However, this was a good thing for Lu Ming.</p><p>I don’t know how long it has been, but the energy here is very abundant. I can let Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body absorb the energy here!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming had an idea. The celestial Thearch’s physical body appeared from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming activated his cultivation technique and began to control the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb the surrounding energy.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was like a black hole, frantically absorbing the energy from the outside.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body absorbed a large amount of flame energy from the lava.</p><p>Not long after, with Celestial Emperor’s body as the center, all the energy in the lava was absorbed, and it turned into rock.</p><p>Lu Ming could only change the location and continue to absorb.</p><p>The amount of energy required by Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was simply too much. It was incomparably shocking.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had spent more than half a year.</p><p>During that half a year, he had been constantly fighting against the evil god race. Every time he killed the evil god race, he would give the crystals that the evil god race had brought along to the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb.</p><p>During that half a year, Lu Ming had killed countless evil god tribesmen and allowed the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb countless crystals and energy. In the end, the energy in the celestial Thearch’s body had only accumulated to twelve percent.</p><p>Moreover, the more the energy of the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was accumulated, the more difficult it would be to improve. The amount of energy required would be even more shocking.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming continued to absorb energy under the lava. A large area of lava turned into rocks. Two days later, the energy in the celestial Thearch’s physical body increased to eight percent.</p><p>This was because the celestial Thearch’s physical body had already stored a portion of energy.</p><p>eight percent isn’t enough. I need at least ten percent and above. The higher the temperature is under the magma, the more I can absorb it!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and then went down.</p><p>As long as he could store more than ten percent of the energy in his body, Lu Ming would be able to control it. By then, he would be able to fight against a great emperor. The chances of obtaining the eternal demonic coffin would be greatly increased.</p><p>Also, the Azure Demon King!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold murderous intent.</p><p>He had to kill the Azure Demon King!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the bottom of the lava lake.</p><p>The temperature at the bottom of the lava lake was shockingly high. Even the Azure Demon King had to retreat, which showed how shocking it was.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s current physical body was Reforged by the energy of the magma Lake, he did not dare to go too deep. Otherwise, he would be turned into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to experience the feeling of being turned into ashes again.</p><p>This time, he was lucky to have his body Reforged. Next time, he might not be so lucky.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>After diving for a while, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure and stopped. He controlled the celestial Thearch’s body and began to absorb energy.</p><p>The energy here was indeed much more abundant.</p><p>When he had finished absorbing the energy nearby, Lu Ming moved to another place and continued to absorb.</p><p>Of course, it was just a shift in skill level. Lu Ming did not dare to continue.</p><p>A few more days passed, and the energy in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body skyrocketed, reaching an astonishing sixteen percent. It was four percent more than the last time.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>16% of the energy was absolutely shocking.</p><p>If he were to fight the great emperor of the he clan again with this kind of energy, he would definitely beat him into a pig’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to leave this place. Most importantly, the energy above the lava lake had almost been completely absorbed by Lu Ming. The temperature was too high if he continued to go down. Lu Ming did not dare to go down.</p><p>Furthermore, he had no idea how long he had been here. How were the ancient Emperor and the others doing? Did they find the ancient demonic coffin?</p><p>Lu Ming kept the celestial Thearch’s body into the mountain and river diagram. Then, he broke through the rocks and rushed up.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming left the lava lake and landed on the shore.</p><p>He swept his gaze around but did not find anyone.</p><p>it seems that the Azure Demon King and the others have left. 1 don’t know how long it has been. Let’s look at the map first!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, took out the black jade talisman, and infused his holy power into it.</p><p>Instantly, a black pattern floated in the air.</p><p>“There’s a situation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The rest of the black pattern was pitch black, but there were some light spots shining in the darkness.</p><p>This meant that someone had to activate the Jade card to see it.</p><p>In one of the places, there was a group of light spots. There were at least a hundred of them, and they were all shining.</p><p>In other places, there were spots of light moving toward the group of spots of light.</p><p>so many people are gathered together. Could it be that the ancient Emperor has gathered them all?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>This meant that the ancient Emperor had yet to retrieve the ancient demonic coffin.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the Jade card and dashed out of the city.</p><p>When he passed by those buildings, he could still hear the roars of beasts and there were claws attacking him. However, Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and passed through the buildings without any danger.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming to cross the entire ancient city and exit the city gate.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>When Lu Ming charged at the demon spirits, they charged at him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
