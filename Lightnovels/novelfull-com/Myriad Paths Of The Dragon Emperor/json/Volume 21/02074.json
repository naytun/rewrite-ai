His palms turned gray as if they were cast from chaos stone and were indestructible.</p><p>This was the primal Chaos Divine palm, and every palm strike was earth-shattering.</p><p>Furthermore, the palm was fused with other nomological laws, making it extremely powerful.</p><p>However, the young man was able to fight Lu Ming. He was also performing a terrifying palm technique that kept clashing with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The wind from the palm scraped off a layer of the rocks on the ground. One must know that the rocks here were extremely hard.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged over a hundred moves.</p><p>is this the place where the great forces of the heaven realm tested their disciples in the ancient times? this difficulty is too great!</p><p>Lu Ming was also extremely shocked.</p><p>After more than two years of cultivation, Lu Ming’s chaos laws had long reached ninety-nine percent. However, it was very difficult to cross this step, cultivate perfectly, and form a River of laws. He needed to accumulate.</p><p>Although the Laws of Chaos were not perfect yet, Lu Ming felt that it would be soon.</p><p>In addition, the law of death was already eighty percent complete, while the law of devouring had caught up and reached ninety percent.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have the corresponding divine ability for the death rule and the devour rule. They could not complement each other and his cultivation speed was naturally much slower.</p><p>However, since Lu Ming’s current realm was profound and he had been in constant battles. After the battles, he had also comprehended under the path-understanding ancient tree. His speed of improvement was extremely fast.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent chaos law, perfect array Dao law, eighty percent death law, and ninety percent devour law.</p><p>The combination of two ultimate maxims and two King path maxims, in addition to Lu Ming’s powerful spirit body and thick Saint energy, was so powerful that Lu Ming found it difficult to gauge his current combat strength.</p><p>However, with such combat power, it was still not easy to pass this stage.</p><p>One could see that the difficulty of this Canyon’s trial was truly astonishing.</p><p>Could it be that there were so many terrifying heaven’s favorites in the ancient times?</p><p>Then, Lu Ming thought of Xie nianqing.</p><p>There was no trace of Xie nianqing. Obviously, Xie nianqing had already passed the test.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat power was shocking. How did she suddenly have such combat power?</p><p>Lu Ming had many doubts in his heart.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another few dozen moves had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming finally gained the upper hand and began to suppress his opponent.</p><p>With four laws fused, a casual palm could pierce through the void and tear space apart.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The other party’s palm made a cracking sound and was broken by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“Devouring, sealing, death…”</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming circulated four types of laws and countless runes, enveloping his opponent in an attempt to seal him. At the same time, he bombarded his opponent with the power of destruction.</p><p>Then, there was the law of devouring, which wanted to devour everything about the other party. At the same time, the law of death enveloped the other party, forming a death cage that wanted to pull the other party into the abyss of death.</p><p>Finally, he used the Laws of Chaos as his main attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on the other party’s body. The other party’s body was penetrated by a terrifying force and finally shattered into pieces.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Lu Ming finally reached the end and cleared the last level.</p><p>According to Xie nianqing, only the strongest below the martial Supreme realm could pass it.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, he was far from the peak.</p><p>His other nomological laws had yet to form a River.</p><p>“Young master, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Qiu Yue walked over, her eyes shining.</p><p>Qiu Yue herself had long cultivated to the Emperor-to-be realm and had also cultivated the light of law. However, she felt that her combat strength was far from Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He walked over and held Qiu Yue’s hand as they stepped into the door of light.</p><p>The next moment, they appeared on the peak of a mountain.</p><p>“En, this place seems to have already left the demonic sea!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the distance. The mountains around him were continuous and full of vitality, unlike the dead silence in the demonic sea.</p><p>I wonder where this place is in the land of myriad demons. I’ll go and find out!</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he and Qiu Yue turned into two streaks of rainbow light and left the place.</p><p>After flying for some distance, they saw a city. The two of them went in and asked around.</p><p>so this place is in the eternal devil nation! And it’s not far from the capital of the eternal devil nation!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He was planning to head to the capital of the ancient devil nation to return the ancient demon coffin to the ancient Emperor.</p><p>Even though the ancient demon coffin was precious, it was still the ancient devil nation’s treasure. The ancient Emperor valued it greatly. If he didn’t return it, it would be equivalent to offending the ancient Emperor and the countless experts of the ancient devil nation.</p><p>It was clearly not a wise move to offend the eternal devil nation over a single ancient devil coffin.</p><p>Since Qiu Yue had already woken up, he had no use for the eternal demonic coffin for the time being.</p><p>Also, he was just about to take the teleportation formation back to the yuan mountains.</p><p>After flying for an entire day, they finally arrived at the capital of the eternal devil nation.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had defeated the ancient devil and was very famous. When he came to pay his respects to the ancient Emperor, someone naturally went in to report.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming saw the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re actually fine!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor was shocked to see Lu Ming.</p><p>In the past few years, he had sent a large number of experts and other great emperors into the demonic sea to attack the black-robed men. He had even sent Emperor-to-be into the canyon. However, those emperors-to-be were like stones sinking into the sea. They never came out after entering.</p><p>It was normal. An ordinary Emperor-to-be would have been killed by the guards at the first level. By then, Lu Ming would have passed a few levels and no one would have seen him.</p><p>Therefore, the ancient Emperor was naturally very surprised to see Lu Ming.</p><p>He used to think that Lu Ming had most likely met with a mishap.</p><p>I was lucky to escape. Great emperor, I’m here to return the ancient demon coffin to you!</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he waved his hand and the ancient demon coffin appeared in the hall.</p><p>haha! It’s really the ancient demonic coffin!</p><p>The ancient Emperor was overjoyed.</p><p>He had put in so much effort and paid a huge price, but he still could not get the eternal demonic coffin back. Now that Lu Ming had it back, he was naturally happy.</p><p>The ancient Emperor kept the ancient demonic coffin with a smile on his face. He then looked at Qiu Yue and said,” “Lu Ming, this little girl is the one you want to save, right?”</p><p>“It is!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad, you’re loyal and affectionate!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, I won’t forget the fact that you’ve helped me retrieve the eternal demonic coffin. If you need help in the future, I’ll do my best to help you!” The ancient Emperor laughed.</p><p>“Thank you, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Returning the ancient demonic coffin to the ancient Emperor was indeed a wise choice.</p><p>The ancient Emperor was a great emperor and the master of the ancient demon nation. He was too powerful. The value of him helping Lu Ming once was immeasurable..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
