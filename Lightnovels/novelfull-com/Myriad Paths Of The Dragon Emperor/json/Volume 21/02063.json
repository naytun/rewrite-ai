Among them, there were two one-star illusionary Emperor-level demon spirits. Their attacks were very terrifying.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw two punches.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack collided with the two demon spirit martial emperors, creating two loud booms.</p><p>The two Mo Ling martial emperors ‘bodies shook violently. They could not withstand Lu Ming’s terrifying power and were forced to retreat.</p><p>“I’ll use you guys to test my battle prowess. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s arms trembled. He felt that his body was filled with infinite power.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed two fingers in a row, and holy power burst forth. At the same time, the array Dao laws and the chaos laws fused and supplemented the chaos finger of calamity.</p><p>Two terrifying finger forces were blasted toward the two Martial Emperor demon spirits.</p><p>Wherever he passed, the energy surged and all the demon spirits in his way collapsed and exploded.</p><p>The two Martial Emperor realm demon spirits seemed to feel threatened. They unleashed their full power and attacked Lu Ming twice.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two earth-shaking rumbles were heard. This time, the two Martial Emperor realm demonic spirits trembled and retreated. Their bodies almost exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>His combat strength had indeed increased by a large margin.</p><p>He had completely suppressed the two one-star martial emperors.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming’s cultivation base was at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, he was no match for a one-star Martial Emperor. He was at a disadvantage and would be suppressed by the other party.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s combat strength at that time, if he had broken through to the perfection of the absolute Saint realm, he would have been able to fight against an ordinary one-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, this time, not only did Lu Ming’s cultivation level break through, but the power of his physical body and the complete fusion of two types of laws had increased his combat strength again. He could now suppress a one-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>He could even suppress two one-star martial emperors.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to point out the chaotic finger of tribulation. The two demon spirit martial emperors were forced to retreat by Lu Ming and could only barely resist.</p><p>As for the demon spirits below the martial Supreme realm, they exploded when Lu Ming’s finger force swept across them.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The weapons of the two demon spirit martial emperors were sent flying by Lu Ming, and cracks appeared on their bodies. If it were not for the armor they were wearing, which was extremely hard, they would have been shattered by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Not far away, there was a battle cry. A few more demon spirits rushed over. They were all Martial Emperor realm demon spirits.</p><p>“I don’t want to play with you guys anymore, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and rushed outside. Wherever he passed, a large number of demon spirits were scattered.</p><p>Ordinary demon spirits could not stop him at all. Lu Ming barged in and broke through the demon spirit Army’s sniping in a short while, disappearing from the place.</p><p>After leaving the area, Lu Ming took out the Jade card again and activated the pattern on it.</p><p>One could clearly see that there was also a light spot shining on Lu Ming’s side. Lu Ming found the right direction and rushed towards the pile of light spots.</p><p>Along the way, they didn’t encounter any strange things. It was very peaceful.</p><p>Lu Ming was getting closer and closer to the group of light spots.</p><p>However, it took Lu Ming three days to get close to the light spots.</p><p>From afar, there was a group of people standing high in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the ancient Emperor with a single glance.</p><p>There was also the Azure Demon King and the few martial sovereigns who had pursued him back then.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. The next moment, he concealed it very well.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the Jade token and flew towards the ancient Emperor and the rest.</p><p>With the ancient Emperor around, he believed that the Azure Demon King would not dare to do anything to him.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was not afraid of the Azure Demon King now. If the other party made a move, Lu Ming would take the opportunity to get rid of him.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you…”</p><p>When the Azure Demon King saw Lu Ming, his mouth opened so wide that he could swallow a duck’s egg. His eyes were about to fall out in disbelief.</p><p>Didn’t he burn Lu Ming’s body with the demonic fire and blast him into the lava? how could he not be dead?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s body seemed to be intact. Even his aura seemed to be much stronger.</p><p>“You … Who are you?”</p><p>The ashen Demon King stammered. He even suspected that the Lu Ming in front of him was someone else in disguise.</p><p>“Azure Demon King, it seems like you’re really getting old. You don’t even recognize me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … How could that be?”</p><p>The Azure Demon King was still dumbfounded.</p><p>The few martial Supremes who had tried to kill Lu Ming were also dumbfounded. Their faces were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Thanks to Cang Demon King, I’m fine. 1 just accidentally broke through in my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The Azure Demon King almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His cultivation base had broken through!</p><p>Lu Ming was trying to tell him that not only was he fine, but his cultivation had also broken through.</p><p>this is all thanks to the Cang Demon King. If not for him, I would probably need some time before 1 could make a breakthrough in my cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming said again.</p><p>The Azure Demon King felt his liver and lungs hurt. His entire body ached and he felt a suffocating feeling in his chest. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor turned his gaze over.</p><p>“Great emperor, I’m fine!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King said hurriedly.</p><p>it’s good that you’re alright. Our goal is to take back the ancient demon coffin. Don’t mess around!</p><p>The ancient Emperor warned. With his experience, he could tell that something must have happened between Lu Ming and the Azure Demon King.</p><p>However, since Lu Ming was fine, he would not bother about it.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled slightly and did not say much.</p><p>The ashen Demon King’s gaze swept over Lu Ming, a cold killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Lu Ming did not die. He was shocked and even had a breakthrough in his cultivation.</p><p>There had always been a saying in the cultivation world.</p><p>Some peerless geniuses were born with great luck.</p><p>This kind of person was usually very difficult to kill. When faced with danger, he could always turn the danger into safety and even use it to break through.</p><p>In the eyes of the Azure Demon King, Lu Ming was such a person.</p><p>This kind of person should be eliminated.</p><p>He and Lu Ming were already mortal enemies. They would not rest until one of them was dead. When Lu Ming grew up in the future, he would definitely seek revenge.</p><p>Therefore, he had to get rid of Lu Ming before he grew up.</p><p>Different thoughts ran through their minds.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming looked for other people to gather information.</p><p>After asking around, Lu Ming found out that he had been in the lava for a few months.</p><p>And this time around, the ancient Emperor had discovered the traces of the ancient demonic coffin. Hence, he had used the map to gather everyone here so that they could snatch the ancient demonic coffin back together.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>More and more people came here.</p><p>After a few more days, there were already more than two hundred people who had arrived.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient Emperor started explaining the situation to everyone.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, an image appeared in the sky.</p><p>In the picture, there was a mountain, and on the mountain, there was a group of people.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes narrowed. The figures on the mountain were all dressed in black robes, and their faces could not be seen clearly. They looked extremely similar to the man who had fought with the ancient Emperor.</p><p>That was a great emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
