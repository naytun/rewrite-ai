After you enter the door of light, you will enter a passageway. There will be various tests waiting for you in the passageway. As long as you can pass this passageway within 30 minutes, you will pass the test. You can go in together!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, the three thousand people flew into the light door.</p><p>The light door was very big. It didn’t seem crowded at all when more than 3000 people flew in. The moment they flew in, they disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his body tremble. He was in a passageway. There was no one else around him. He was alone.</p><p>He knew that there was definitely a great formation set up here.</p><p>It wasn’t strange for great emperors to have some profound formations.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>Although this passage was somewhat difficult, it was not a problem for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his full strength but he passed through the entire passage very quickly. He smiled when he saw the entrance of the passage in front of him.</p><p>About five minutes!</p><p>He only used five minutes to pass through the passage.</p><p>The test of this passage was very complicated. Not only did it test one’s combat power, but it also tested one’s courage, decisiveness, wisdom, willpower, and many more. It was very comprehensive.</p><p>If he was outstanding in all these aspects, his talent would definitely not be bad.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had gone through many storms and similar tests along the way. These tests were not difficult for him at all.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out of the passageway.</p><p>As soon as he exited the passage, Lu Ming saw many people looking at him.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He realized that there were many people standing in the air. Most of them were older people, and some of them had particularly terrifying auras.</p><p>no way! There are so many great emperors!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He realized that there were no less than ten elders, and they all exuded the aura of great emperors.</p><p>I’m not that fast, almsgiver. You’re not that fast, hahaha!</p><p>With a Buddhist chant, the unscrupulous monk appeared. His speed was even faster than Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming could not help but feel surprised.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had not used his full strength just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the area and realized that a few young men had already passed through the passageway.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a young man with a tall and straight figure. He stood with his hands behind his back and had a domineering aura.</p><p>The son of chaos, Yuan Xin!</p><p>Lu Ming had seen it during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment. How could he forget?</p><p>Yuan Xin glanced at Lu Ming indifferently and then looked away.</p><p>“Little fellow, what law do you cultivate?</p><p>At this moment, an elder looked at Lu Ming with a bright gaze.</p><p>“The law of death!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, the aura of the death law emanating from his body.</p><p>“You’re indeed the Son of God? Little fellow, are you willing to take me as your master?”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“I feel that this old man is fated with him, and he should take me as his master!”</p><p>Another old man spoke. These people were all at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>Could it be that some great emperor figures were guarding here to take in disciples?</p><p>benefactor, these are the divine Lands. They are all great emperors. Their purpose is to find talented young men to take in as disciples and pass on their legacies!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and understood.</p><p>In the yuan continent, under certain circumstances, changing factions was not a big deal.</p><p>For example, some of the overwhelming prodigies had weak cultivation bases, and had yet to rise to prominence. They might have Masters with low cultivation bases, but these chosen would quickly rise to prominence and surpass their Masters.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s current cultivation base was much stronger than that of the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Therefore, those who had already started to acknowledge their Masters could no longer help those heaven’s favorites. Those heaven’s favorites could naturally acknowledge someone stronger as their master.</p><p>Therefore, these great emperors were waiting here to try their luck. If they met a peerless genius who didn’t have a powerful force behind him and was willing to take him as a master, they would be in for a good deal.</p><p>senior, thank you for your kindness. I already have a master, so I won’t be taking him as my master for the time being!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists to express his gratitude.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>The great emperors shook their heads in pity.</p><p>He was the child of death and could pass through the passage in five minutes. He was top-tier in all aspects, and all the emperors were tempted.</p><p>However, it was obvious that very few of these heaven’s favorites would really take a master. Usually, there would be a powerful force behind them, or a powerhouse.</p><p>The group continued to wait. A few more people appeared behind them. Lu Ming saw a familiar face, the ancient devil.</p><p>In the land of infinite demons, the genius who cultivated the ancient demonic path was undoubtedly a terrifying opponent.</p><p>Several years had passed, and no one knew what level his cultivation base had reached.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, Mo Li!”</p><p>At the eighth minute, Lu Ming saw Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli walking out almost at the same time.</p><p>“He’s so young!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes moved, and the eyes of the old men lit up.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli looked too young.</p><p>Ouyang Moli was slightly older, but he looked to be around 20 years old. Lu Xiangxiang, on the other hand, looked to be less than 20 years old.</p><p>It was extremely rare for someone so young to be able to walk out of the passageway in eight minutes.</p><p>The hearts of those old men were moved again.</p><p>haha, the two of them are not bad. They passed through the passageway in eight minutes. They are extremely talented!</p><p>An old man stepped forward and said with a smile.</p><p>“Greetings, senior!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli bowed politely.</p><p>“What laws have you two comprehended?”</p><p>Another old man walked over and asked with a smile.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli didn’t hide anything and released their auras.</p><p>“The sons from last time, they’re all the sons from last time!”</p><p>The old men’s eyes lit up even more.</p><p>“Little girl, are you willing to take me as your master?”</p><p>“Little fellow, are you willing to take me as your master?”</p><p>The few old men spoke one after another as they stared at Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli. Their eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli looked at each other and shook their heads.</p><p>“Senior, junior already has a master, so 1 won’t take another person as my master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shook her head.</p><p>“You already have a master? who is your master? I’m a great emperor!”</p><p>An old man was anxious and quickly opened his mouth to reveal his cultivation.</p><p>my master’s current cultivation is not as high as senior’s, but in the future, he will definitely become a peak expert!</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang said with a firm expression.</p><p>“Haha, little girl, how can it be so easy to become a peak expert? Don’t be tricked!”</p><p>The old man laughed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
