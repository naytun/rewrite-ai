Young prince, do you know Lu Ming?”</p><p>Luo Xuan also felt that something was amiss and asked.</p><p>“So he’s just a guest. Princess Luo Xuan, can you hand him over to me?”</p><p>The young Prince’s eyes flickered, and the killing intent in them grew even stronger.</p><p>“Young prince, he is my guest, so I have to be responsible for him. Why do you want me to hand him over to you?”</p><p>Luo Xuan’s brows furrowed even more as he asked.</p><p>The other young men seemed to have sensed that something was amiss as well, and they held their breaths, not even daring to take a deep breath.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young prince spoke coldly, his killing intent bursting forth without restraint.”This person must die!”</p><p>“Young prince, is there a misunderstanding here?”</p><p>Luo Yi said. He secretly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and asked,”Lu Ming, when did you offend Cang Yan?”</p><p>Cang Yan was the name of the young prince.</p><p>“It’s my first time seeing him!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and sent a voice transmission to Princess Luo Xuan.</p><p>He was also baffled. He had never seen Cang Yan before, so he really didn’t understand why Cang Yan wanted to kill him as soon as he saw him.</p><p>“Misunderstanding? Any direct descendent of the Azure Demon king’s palace will have a mark on their body. As long as they are killed, this mark will attach itself to the murderer. 1 can feel the mark of my Azure Demon king’s palace on his body, is this a misunderstanding?”</p><p>Cang Yan coldly said.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved as they understood.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed a direct descendant of the ashen Demon King’s residence. The other party’s Mark was attached to his body and Cang Yan could sense it.</p><p>It was no wonder that Cang Yan wanted to kill Lu Ming the moment he saw him.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He suddenly recalled that not long after he came to the land of infinite demons, he was cultivating somewhere when a group of people went to snatch the demon origin fruit and he killed them in the end.</p><p>One of them was a young man who had shouted out that he was from the eternal devil nation. Could that man be a direct descendant of the Azure Demon King’s residence?</p><p>This was too much of a coincidence!</p><p>Moreover, he had seen the mark of the Azure Demon King’s residence before.</p><p>The thousand-kill Manor was a terrifying assassin organization. As long as one killed a member of the thousand-kill Manor, there would be a killing mark attached to one’s body. Back then, Lu Ming had to ask the palace Master of Phoenix Palace to remove it.</p><p>The mark of the Azure Demon King’s residence was very similar to the mark of the thousand kills residence.</p><p>Luo Xuan frowned and said,” “Young prince, is there a mistake?”</p><p>definitely not. A few months ago, one of my younger cousins was killed while training outside. It should be this person who killed him!</p><p>Luo Xuan, this person is only a guest elder. You should stay out of this matter!</p><p>Cang Yan said, then waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind Cang Yan, a young man rushed out, and a sword light bloomed as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword light was cold. This was a sword to cut the throat.</p><p>“Judge!”</p><p>Luo Xuan said softly as he struck out with the power of judgment, crushing his opponent’s sword light.</p><p>“Princess Luo Xuan, you want to protect this man? Do you think it’s worth it to fall out with my Azure Demon King’s residence for a guest elder?”</p><p>Cang Yan’s face sank, revealing a threatening tone.</p><p>a few months ago, I did kill someone. However, that person wanted to fight for a treasure and attacked me without any explanation. How could 1 not retaliate? H</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>I see. Young prince, it’s normal for anyone to be killed in the land of myriad demons when they’re out training and fighting for treasures.</p><p>in the land of infinite demons, strength speaks for itself. If one’s strength is inferior to others, taking revenge now would be a joke!</p><p>Luo Xuan said coldly, not backing down an inch.</p><p>In the land of ten thousand demons, there was constant killing. Martial arts were respected, and the weak were prey to the strong. No matter who it was, it was better to be prepared to be killed when training outside.</p><p>This was the rule of the land of myriad demons!</p><p>“Hmph, my cousin has several Emperor-to-be followers. How many Emperor-to-be can he deal with? He probably used some despicable means to harm my cousin. How about this, let him fight with me. If he can withstand ten moves from me and not lose, I will acknowledge his strength!”</p><p>Cang Yan coldly said.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was merely a guest master of Luo Xuan. How strong could he be?</p><p>Behind Cang Yan, some of the young men sneered.</p><p>Cang Yan was one of the top geniuses in the eternal demon nation. His battle prowess was absolutely terrifying. Not only did he have a King body, but his cultivation had also reached the absolute Saint perfection long ago.</p><p>How could Lu Ming withstand ten moves from Cang Yan? he would probably be killed by Cang Yan in one exchange.</p><p>This was Cang Yan’s goal. As long as he made a move against Lu Ming, he would be able to kill Lu Ming with a legitimate reason.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Although Cang Yan was powerful, Lu Ming could even defeat Ji Tian. He was definitely not weaker than Cang Yan. Wouldn’t it be easy for him to withstand ten moves?</p><p>“Alright, 1 agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and said indifferently.</p><p>“He actually dared to agree. It seems that this kid doesn’t know how powerful Cang Yan is!”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>However, some people also had the mentality of watching a show.</p><p>“This kid is really looking for death!”</p><p>Some of the youths behind Cang Yan revealed playful smiles.</p><p>Cang Yan’s eyes flashed with a cold light,”Princess Luo Xuan, since he has already agreed, please do not interfere!”</p><p>I won’t interfere. 1 hope that young prince will keep his word!</p><p>After saying that, Luo Xuan returned to the table.</p><p>“You mean what you say? This little girl, could it be that she thinks that this kid can block ten of my moves? Where is your confidence coming from?”</p><p>The corners of the young Prince’s lips curled into a cold smile. Then, he turned to Lu Ming, his killing intent even colder.</p><p>Anyone who dared to kill the people of the Azure Demon King’s residence would definitely die. He wanted to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys in front of all the people from the small countries today and make them fear him even more.</p><p>“Let’s fight in the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I don’t need to go to the sky to deal with you. One move is enough!</p><p>Cang Yan sneered before pointing out a finger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This finger was like a long spear, piercing through the void and letting out a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>This finger was highly condensed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even look at it. He pointed his finger and runes shone on it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two fingers collided with a loud boom. The terrifying force overturned many tables and chairs around them. Many people retreated in fear to avoid the scattered force.</p><p>Cang Yan’s figure was pushed back two steps and was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Array Dao laws, you have a King physique!”</p><p>Cang Yan roared.</p><p>“So it’s the law of penetration!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was very familiar with this law. Luo pokong of the Daluo heaven sect also controlled this law, but he had already been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Like 1 said, we’re going to fight in the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently, causing Cang Yan’s face to turn extremely dark and his killing intent to turn incomparably cold.</p><p>Just now, he was full of confidence and said that he could kill Lu Ming in one move without having to fly high up in the air. However, the truth was a slap to his face.</p><p>“Let’s go up and fight!”</p><p>Cang Yan said coldly. Like a divine spear, he shot into the sky. Lu Ming also stepped into the air..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
