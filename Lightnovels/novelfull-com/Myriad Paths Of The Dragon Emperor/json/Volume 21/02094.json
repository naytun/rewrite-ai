But now, the death god nation had assassinated the son of chaos in destiny city. This was a slap to the face of the Overlord forces in destiny city.</p><p>The world was in an uproar. A powerful son of chaos was actually assassinated in the city of Destiny by the kingdom of death. This was a major event that shocked countless people.</p><p>Many people even doubted if this was true.</p><p>But later on, someone stood up and said that it was true. They were on the ancient battlefield and saw with their own eyes that the death god nation had dispatched a large number of experts to assassinate the son of chaos, Lu Ming.</p><p>The news was confirmed. Many people couldn’t stay calm, especially some powerful heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The assassin organization of the death god nation was too terrifying. Since it could assassinate the son of chaos, it could also assassinate them.</p><p>The activities of many heaven’s favorites became low-key.</p><p>The Overlord Force of Destiny city was furious and sent out a large number of experts to encircle and annihilate the people of the death god nation. Unfortunately, they only managed to destroy a few insignificant branches and couldn’t find the headquarters at all.</p><p>The death god nation’s people jumped out and clamored again. Whoever they wanted to kill, it was the same no matter where they hid. Their words were extremely arrogant.</p><p>The Overlord forces of the destiny city were helpless, they could only strengthen the defense of the city. In the vast destiny city, every region was guarded by powerful existences. If something went wrong, they would send out their experts to prevent another assassination.</p><p>However, this matter had a huge impact and touched the hearts of countless people.</p><p>In an Inn in destiny city, Qiu Yue, Long Chen, and Huang Li were in disbelief when they heard the news.</p><p>“Impossible, it can’t be. Young master can’t be dead!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face was pale and tears were rolling in her eyes.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Lu Ming will definitely not die!”</p><p>Long Chen and desolate li spoke one after another. Their fists were clenched tightly together, and a cold killing intent emanated from their bodies.</p><p>In another ancient city in the South of the heavenly Emperor City, Huang Ling, Luo Tianyi, and the others were traveling there. When they heard the news, their faces turned pale.</p><p>“No, no one can kill him!”</p><p>The few of them whispered.</p><p>The divine land was surrounded by the sea. Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli had just set foot in the divine land. When they heard the news, their bodies trembled.</p><p>“My master won’t die!”</p><p>The two of them could not believe that Lu Ming had been killed. In their eyes, Lu Ming was irreplaceable. One day, he would be invincible.</p><p>On a mountain peak, the death blade stood against the wind with a wild aura.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t die yet. 1 still have to defeat you and take over your identity as the Golden inheritor!”</p><p>A deep voice came from the death blade.</p><p>In destiny city, in an elegant courtyard, Xing Chen stood tall with his hands behind his back.</p><p>After not seeing him for a few years, the Galaxy had become even more terrifying, and its aura was unfathomable.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 wanted to kill you with my own hands. What a pity!” Xinghe smiled faintly.</p><p>In Yuan mountain, the Heng family, he family, Daluo heaven sect, ancient Moon Holy Land’s golden Crow clan, Wan family, and other forces were all ecstatic after hearing this.</p><p>Lu Ming’s death was great news to them, especially to the ancient Moon Holy Land’s WAN family, the Golden Crow clan, and other forces.</p><p>This was because, in the heaven Empyrean city, Lu Ming had used the heaven Empyrean’s body to kill a few experts and even beat the he clan Thearch into fleeing. This had chilled the hearts of some of the forces in the ancient Moon Holy Land who had enmity with Lu Ming. They had been on tenterhooks, afraid that Lu Ming would use the heaven Empyrean’s body to kill their sects and annihilate them.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had been killed, they heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>At the same time, they also guessed that Lu Ming’s celestial Thearch body seemed to have a great limit. Perhaps he could not use it at all now. Otherwise, why would he be assassinated by the people of the death god nation?</p><p>If he could control the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, the people of the death god nation would only be courting death if they came.</p><p>“Hahaha, brat, only death awaits those who dare to oppose me!”</p><p>In Aeon city, Mu yang of the MU family laughed heartily.</p><p>His only regret was that he did not kill Lu Ming with his own hands.</p><p>The divine land was in an uproar. Lu Ming had been in the depths of the ancient battlefield.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered. However, he did not go out. Instead, he continued to cultivate in the ancient battlefield.</p><p>He speculated that the death god nation’s assassins were probably hired by Muyang. As long as they knew he was dead, Muyang wouldn’t do anything, and Long Chen, Qiu Yue, and the others would be safe.</p><p>The depths of the ancient battlefield were indeed extremely beneficial for cultivating the death law.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the rest of the time in seclusion to comprehend the death law.</p><p>Every day, he had great gains.</p><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, two months had passed. Lu Ming had made great progress in the death rule.</p><p>His law of death had already reached 95%, on par with the law of devouring.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s four types of laws were fused together and erupted. The power was even more shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had improved again.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming walked out of the ancient battlefield because the time for the ten lands battle had come.</p><p>Lu Ming had disguised himself as a dark-skinned young man. No one could recognize him when he walked on the streets.</p><p>Lu Ming inquired about the news of the ten-lands battle.</p><p>As there were too many people participating in the battle of the ten lands, they had to be selected.</p><p>From all over the yuan continent, countless heaven’s favorites had come. The number was shocking. If they were to compete one by one, it would be too slow.</p><p>Hence, the battle of the ten lands was split into four battle zones.</p><p>North, South, East, and West, four battle zones.</p><p>Everyone could choose any battle zone to sign up for. After that, they would be screened before they could participate in the final battle.</p><p>The time would start tomorrow.</p><p>Lu Ming found a place to stay and the day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming headed to the southern Warzone.</p><p>It was an extremely spacious area. However, when Lu Ming arrived, he realized that the empty space was almost packed with people.</p><p>Of course, many of them were already older and had come to watch the show. There were naturally not many Young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>In the middle of the open space, there was a huge platform. At this time, a few figures were floating above the platform, emitting a shocking aura.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He realized that one of them had an extremely deep and terrifying aura.</p><p>This was not the first time Lu Ming had come into contact with a great emperor. Naturally, he could easily tell that this person was an expert in the great emperor realm.</p><p>The four battle zones were under the control of the four Overlord forces in destiny city. This man should be an expert from one of the Overlord forces.</p><p>the selection will be divided into a few rounds. The first round is very simple. All of you will come and register first, then climb up to this platform. We will test you all together!</p><p>The great emperor realm expert spoke.</p><p>His voice wasn’t loud, but it rang in everyone’s ears.</p><p>Below the platform, there were a few places for registration. Some young people came forward and began to register. After they registered, they went up to the platform.</p><p>When the number of people on the platform reached around a thousand, the great emperor realm expert called out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
