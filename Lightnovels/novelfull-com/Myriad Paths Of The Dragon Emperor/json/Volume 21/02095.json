All of you will try your best to resist it. As long as you can hold on for thirty breaths and still stand firm, you will pass. Those who can’t withstand it will be eliminated!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Many people were moved. This method was simple.</p><p>They gathered together and used their auras to suppress the others. Those who could resist would advance.</p><p>in this case, the efficiency was indeed high. Those with weak cultivation could be quickly filtered out.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>As the old man s voice rang out, a terrifying aura burst out from the old man’s body and enveloped the entire platform. “True Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the elder was a true Emperor realm powerhouse.</p><p>As soon as the old man’s aura was released, the expressions of some people on the platform changed. Their bodies trembled, and they coughed out large mouthfuls of blood before directly kneeling on the ground.</p><p>“Senior, please have mercy, I can’t block it anymore!’1</p><p>The young man roared. He felt as if his body was going to be crushed into meat paste.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>let s go, ” the old man said indifferently as he controlled his aura. The pressure on the young man’s body was instantly lifted. He rushed down the fighting ring in a hurry, gasping for breath.</p><p>a mere bright Saint actually dares to go up the stage. He really doesn’t know his own place!</p><p>this is the battle of the ten lands. It’s not a small place. It’s ridiculous that a bright Saint dares to fight!</p><p>Many people shook their heads and laughed.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands gathered the strongest geniuses of the ten lands. A mere bright Saint realm was not enough.</p><p>The young man’s face turned red.</p><p>In fact, there was more than one person like this young man.</p><p>Plop! Plop!</p><p>On the platform, a large number of young men knelt down and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>The cultivation of these young men were all around bright Saint.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands touched the hearts of people. It was the first time in history and countless people paid attention to it.</p><p>Many young people wanted to perform on such a stage, hoping to be the center of attention. Therefore, many people with low cultivation levels wanted to participate.</p><p>A large number of people vomited blood and rushed off the platform, directly eliminated.</p><p>And as time passed, the pressure from the old man’s body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>After that, even the Supreme Saints couldn’t resist and were eliminated.</p><p>In the end, only about a hundred out of a thousand people managed to resist for thirty breaths.</p><p>Of course, their conditions were all different. Some people were trembling all over, breaking out in cold sweat, and gasping for breath. They had clearly exhausted all their strength.</p><p>Some people were calm and relaxed, their expressions normal.</p><p>The names of those who advanced were left behind and could advance to the next round.</p><p>you’ve ail seen it. If you’re not strong enough, then don’t sign up. Otherwise, you’ll only humiliate yourself and get injured!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor said.</p><p>Many of the young men had unsightly expressions and sighed helplessly in the end.</p><p>They had originally wanted to show off, but in reality, they were not even qualified to participate, not even to serve as a foil.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands was the stage for the true heaven’s favorites.</p><p>As long as one could obtain a place in the battle of the ten lands, it would be a great honor. However, most people could only be spectators.</p><p>Following that, more and more people came forward to register.</p><p>When there were about a thousand people, the old man once again released his aura and pressed it against the young man on the platform.</p><p>This time, the situation was much better. Out of 1000 people, about 500 people made it to the next round.</p><p>Because those with insufficient cultivation knew that they couldn’t pass and would only get injured, they didn’t sign up.</p><p>Then, the selection continued.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, Mo Li, Qiu Yue, Feng Ling …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw Xiangxiang Bella, Qiu Yue, and the rest in the crowd.</p><p>They were all here, and they were all in the southern Warzone.</p><p>With their cultivation, they naturally passed the selection easily.</p><p>“I’ll go up too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and went forward to register.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to acknowledge Xiangxiang Bella and the others.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>At the registration counter, someone looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianyun!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Leave behind your aura!”</p><p>The other party said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left behind a wisp of his aura. This was to identify him.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stepped onto the platform.</p><p>“I’m a heartless monk!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just stepped onto the platform when he heard a Buddhist chant from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyelids kept twitching. He was very familiar with this voice. Although he had not heard it for more than ten years, he would never forget it.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw a chubby young monk stepping onto the platform.</p><p>An unscrupulous monk!</p><p>Lu Ming was in a daze. He did not expect to meet an unscrupulous monk here.</p><p>Back then, in the divine wilderness, Wu Liang and moonless had left for the yuan continent before him. They had not seen each other for more than ten years.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was still the same as more than ten years ago. He had not changed at all.</p><p>When he walked up and saw Lu Ming staring at him, he could not help but chant the name of Buddha.</p><p>“I have no hair. Benefactor, you are staring at this poor monk with such “tender feelings’. Could it be that you have taken a fancy to this poor monk? It’s a pity that you’re a man. If you’re a beautiful woman, I’d consider you!”</p><p>The monk said with a smile.</p><p>“Go to the side!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. This guy had not changed at all.</p><p>benefactor, why do 1 feel like we’ve met before? there’s a sense of familiarity.</p><p>It’s over, it’s over. Why do 1 have such feelings for a man? ”</p><p>The heartless monk started to stare at Lu Ming. Then, his face turned bitter and he sighed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated. At the same time, he was shocked. This unreliable monk had such sharp senses. He had used the divine breath technique but the unscrupulous monk could still sense it.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>Following that, another Buddhist chant was heard and a few young monks stepped onto the platform.</p><p>“Moonless, wuchen!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized a few of them.</p><p>The moonless Bodhisattva was also someone he was familiar with in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The other was Wu Chen from boundless temple. He controlled the law of karma and was one of the sons of God.</p><p>Soon, there were about a thousand people on the platform. The true Emperor realm elder’s aura began to explode, and everyone felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>However, this pressure was nothing to Lu Ming. He did not feel much.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Wu Liang, Wu Yue, and Wu Chen were the same. Their faces were calm and they did not react at all.</p><p>it seems that after Wu Liang and Wu Yue came to the yuan continent, their strength has also improved astonishingly!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming was unfamiliar with the cultivation of Buddhism. He realized that he could nor see through the cultivation of the young monks at all. It was as if there was a ball of dazzling golden light in their bodies that concealed their cultivation realm.</p><p>Thirty breaths passed in the blink of an eye, and they all passed the test very easily.</p><p>“I have no hair. Benefactor, have we met before? Since you are destined to be a Buddhist, why don’t you shave your head and join the Buddhist sect?”</p><p>Wu Ming came to Lu Ming and said with a smile.</p><p>“Go play somewhere else!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and walked down the fighting ring alone..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
