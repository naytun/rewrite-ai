It extended from the top of the palace to the bottom.</p><p>The guests who went to congratulate him went up the Jade stairs from the four-sided Palace to the ninth level of the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming and the people from the youluo demonic kingdom went up the Jade stairs on the east side.</p><p>“What a magnificent palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>This nine-story Palace was too huge. It was a hundred thousand feet tall and pierced through the depths of the sky.</p><p>Even this Jade staircase was huge. A person standing on it was like an ant.</p><p>In this direction, people kept coming up the Jade stairs to congratulate him.</p><p>The ancient devil nation was one of the two Super Devil nations in the land of ten thousand Devils. Almost half of the devil nations, big and small, would come to congratulate them. Naturally, the number of people would be shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group walked up the Jade stairs and spent half an hour before they reached the highest point and arrived at the ninth level of the hall.</p><p>The ninth level of the palace was open air and extremely wide. There were all kinds of sacred medicines and strange flowers planted everywhere, and the fragrance assailed the nose.</p><p>This area was already filled with tables and chairs.</p><p>The youluo devil Kingdom was one of the five great exalted kingdoms. As soon as they arrived, someone led them to a higher position.</p><p>The location of this area was also very particular. The height was different, and the levels were higher.</p><p>The lowest terrain was where the people of the lower-class devil nations sat.</p><p>The second-ranked devil nations were the middle-ranked devil nations.</p><p>Above them were the five high-rank devil nations.</p><p>At the very top were the experts of the ancient devil nation and the nobles.</p><p>“Brother Luo!”</p><p>“Brother Luo!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, there were already some people there. They greeted the Luo family master one after another.</p><p>These people were the Kings of other high-rank devil nations, and they all had prominent identities.</p><p>Now that the Luo family was in control of the youluo devil Kingdom, they naturally greeted the head of the Luo family.</p><p>At the side, the you family’s master snorted coldly. De led you ning, Ji Tian, and the others to find a random seat.</p><p>Following that, more and more people arrived, and the vast space was almost full.</p><p>“The country ruler has arrived!”</p><p>A voice resounded through the entire place, and everyone quieted down.</p><p>The king of this place was naturally the king of the eternal devil nation.</p><p>A group of people came from the sky and landed on the highest point.</p><p>The person in the lead was a burly old man in a purple and gold robe. He had a smile on his face, and although he did not reveal any aura, he had a supreme majesty.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the ancient Emperor!”</p><p>Everyone bowed in respect.</p><p>The king of every generation of the ancient devil nation was addressed as the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“Everyone, please sit!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor waved his hand and everyone took their seats.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the crowd and noticed that there were many people around the ancient Emperor. Some were older, while others were from the younger generation.</p><p>Many of them had powerful auras and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>There was no doubt that there was a great emperor among them.</p><p>There was definitely more than one great emperor in the ancient devil nation.</p><p>“Cang Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Cang Yan in the crowd behind the ancient Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, Cang Yan’s eyes were also on the youluo demonic kingdom. When he saw Lu Ming, a cold killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Yan ‘er, the person you’re talking about is that kid?”</p><p>Beside the ancient Emperor, there was a skinny old man with white hair who was transmitting a message to Cang Yan.</p><p>This person was Cang Yan’s grandfather, the Cang Demon King.</p><p>“Grandpa, it’s this person!”</p><p>Cang Yan nodded.</p><p>“Yes, I understand!”</p><p>The hidden Demon King nodded and didn’t continue speaking. His face was calm, and no one could tell what he was thinking.</p><p>the Tianyu devil Kingdom congratulates the ancient Emperor on surviving the Great Tribulation and obtaining eternal life!</p><p>At this moment, the monarch of the heaven devil Kingdom stood up to congratulate the ancient Emperor and presented him with gifts.</p><p>the youluo demonic kingdom congratulates the ancient Emperor for overcoming his tribulation. You can look forward to becoming the heavenly Emperor!</p><p>The master of the Luo family also sent a congratulatory gift.</p><p>Following that, the rulers of the devil nations came forward to offer their congratulations and congratulatory gifts.</p><p>Starting from the five high-rank devil nations, it was the turn of the low-rank devil nations.</p><p>“Thank you for coming today, please sit!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s voice rang out. Following that, the maidservants brought out all sorts of fine wine and delicacies.</p><p>After that, a peerlessly enchanting witch came forward to perform the demonic dance, and the atmosphere of the scene became warm.</p><p>great emperor, there are so many geniuses in this world. Why don’t we let the younger generation have a friendly match?” Zhao Feng suggested.</p><p>Someone suggested.</p><p>This was something that would happen every time the ancient Emperor transcended a tribulation of the heavens and earth. Some people were looking forward to it.</p><p>haha, 1 also want to see how outstanding the geniuses of this generation are. 1 heard that there’s more than one Son of God in this generation, and there are even more King bodies!</p><p>The ancient Emperor laughed.</p><p>that’s right. This generation is indeed full of geniuses, more than any previous era!</p><p>The Azure Demon King said.</p><p>Oh, if that’s the case, I’ll change the rewards this time as well. The top three can make a request to me, and I’ll try my best to fulfill it if it’s something that only 1 can do. The top ten can also receive a reward!</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s voice reverberated in all directions.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning with desire.</p><p>The top three could make a request to the great emperor. This was too tempting.</p><p>Furthermore, the rewards that the top ten would receive would definitely not be small.</p><p>The reward this time was also better than before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>The top three could make a request of the ancient Emperor. If he were to get into the top three, he would be able to borrow the eternal demonic coffin from the ancient Emperor.</p><p>Since the Emperor had said it himself, he probably wouldn’t reject it. Moreover, it was only for a month.</p><p>“I must enter the top three!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fists were clenched tightly.</p><p>Even though he did not know how strong the Son of Heaven from the eternal devil nation was, Lu Ming believed that if he were to go all out, he should be able to get into the top three.</p><p>alright, then we’ll let the Azure Demon King take charge of this round of sparring!</p><p>The ancient Emperor laughed.</p><p>He didn’t need to manage such a matter personally. He could leave it to others.</p><p>“Thank you, Your Majesty!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King stood up and took a step forward, arriving in the air outside the palace.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a platform floated up. Then, the platform expanded rapidly, turning into a fighting ring with a length and width of one hundred miles.</p><p>The height of the fighting ring was slightly lower than the palace. Sitting on it, one could see the situation on the fighting ring very well.</p><p>“Young people who wish to participate in the sparring can register first and leave behind your name.”</p><p>The Azure Demon King said before calling for a few people to register the information.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, young people flew forward one by one to register.</p><p>There were too many people. In an instant, hundreds of people went up.</p><p>“Who do you guys think will enter the top three this time?”</p><p>that goes without saying. The two sons of God will definitely enter the top three!</p><p>that’s right. Two of the top three are the sons of God, so there will definitely be a spot for them. The key is who will be able to obtain the other spot!</p><p>“Cang Yan and Liu Xu are both very likely?”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings began to discuss..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
