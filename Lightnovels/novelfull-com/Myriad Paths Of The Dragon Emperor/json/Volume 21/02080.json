She gritted her teeth and said,” so what if he’s the son of Samsara? I’m going to see how powerful the law of Samsara is today!</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Yu He coldly spoke as he stepped forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The six vortexes on Yu He’s back moved with him and shot toward Zi liusu.</p><p>The six vortexes spun rapidly and exploded with terrifying power, trying to pull Zi liusu in and drag him into the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>Zi liusu’s expression was extremely serious. He exploded with all his power, and purple light burst forth from his body, forming a purple sword light that slashed toward Yuhe.</p><p>Zi liusu had used all his strength in this move. It was powerful enough to shock ordinary people.</p><p>However, he was facing a Scion of Samsara.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The whirlpool of the six paths of reincarnation pressed down and Zi liusu’s sword radiance disintegrated into purple light spots.</p><p>Zi liusu’s body shook violently and was sent flying like a cannonball. He spat out a mouthful of blood in the air.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>One move, just one move, and Zi liusu was defeated. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>“Is the difference between the king physique and the Son of God that big?”</p><p>Someone said unwillingly. This was also a King body.</p><p>Yuhe’s cultivation must have reached the Emperor-to-be realm as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat Zi liusu in one move!</p><p>however, the difference between the Son of Heaven and the body of a King is indeed huge. In a battle of the same level, the body of a King is no match for the Son of Heaven!</p><p>unless the Son of Heaven didn’t cultivate the light of law. In that case, it’s possible to compete with the king physique, but the chances of losing are still high!</p><p>Some of the geniuses sighed.</p><p>there’s no need to sigh. The Son of God does indeed have an absolute advantage below the martial Supreme realm. He’s almost invincible in a battle of the same realm, but that’s only for those below the martial Supreme realm!</p><p>after reaching the Martial Emperor realm, one can comprehend many laws. Some of them don’t even have the king body. Great talents mature late. Before the Martial Emperor realm, their performance was mediocre, but after breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm, they rose up in one fell swoop and comprehended the strongest law. It’s enough to compete with or even defeat the Son of God!</p><p>A young man spoke, full of confidence in himself.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up with hope when they heard this.</p><p>Yes, that was indeed the case!</p><p>The so-called King’s body and the Son of God only gave him a temporary advantage. However, after he became a martial sovereign, this advantage would weaken.</p><p>This was because martial sovereigns could comprehend a variety of laws. Some people below the rank of martial sovereigns could only comprehend ordinary laws. However, after breaking through to the rank of a martial sovereign, they could comprehend an ultimate law in one go. They would then break through all the barriers and become unparalleled experts.</p><p>There were many such examples in history.</p><p>After defeating Zi liusu, Yuhe landed on the Emperor-gazing pillar and stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an overbearing aura.</p><p>Zi liusu glared at Yu He, but in the end, she didn’t step on the other gazing Emperor pillars.</p><p>If one’s strength was insufficient, even if they stepped on it, they would be blasted down.</p><p>Some of the other King bodies were also tempted, but they held back.</p><p>At this moment, some people looked at the young man who was the first to step onto the gazing Emperor pillar.</p><p>This person was dressed in a white robe. Even after seeing Yu He defeat Zi liusu, his expression remained calm. Everyone immediately knew that this person was also a Son of God.</p><p>The two sons of death hadn’t even arrived yet, and two sons of heaven had already appeared. This made everyone look forward to it.</p><p>When the children of heaven gather, will they have a duel first?</p><p>“Haha, it’s really lively!”</p><p>A loud laugh sounded out as a red-robed young man stepped through the air and directly landed on one of the gazing-the-Emperor pillars.</p><p>Some people recognized that this was also a Son of God from the land of divine destiny.</p><p>The divine land was the most powerful land in the primordial realm. It was vast and boundless. Apart from the desolate land, the other eight lands added together were only as big as the divine land.</p><p>There were naturally many geniuses.</p><p>It was said that the divine land had each of the ten ultimate maxims. Some even had more than one ultimate Maxim.</p><p>It was truly shocking for the top ten to gather in one place.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>A Buddhist proclamation sounded, and a young monk stepped through the air.</p><p>A snow-white cassock fluttered in the wind, untainted by dust and dirt.</p><p>The monk also landed on one of the Emperor-gazing pillars.</p><p>“It’s Saint monk Wu Chen of boundless temple!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Saint monk Wu Chen is here too. 1 heard that he controls the law of karma, one of the ten strongest laws. Everything is within karma!</p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p>“The law of karma!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The law of karma was also one of the top 10 laws. Without a doubt, it was an extremely terrifying and mysterious law.</p><p>Everything in the world had cause and effect, and the cycle of cause and effect formed the world.</p><p>To be able to control the law of karma and to be able to control karma, this was definitely terrifying. It could kill people without them noticing.</p><p>Four. Now, it was the fourth child of God.</p><p>Many people were looking forward to seeing if these Children of Heaven would start a war.</p><p>At this moment, two streaks of light flew over from the distance.</p><p>These two rainbow lights were also two young men.</p><p>They did not slow down and landed on the Wangdi pillar.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of them. He was the son of the void, the top genius of the immortal demon Kingdom in the land of infinite demons.</p><p>Some people recognized the other person. He was a peerless genius of the divine fated land.</p><p>“Six sons of God!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“This time, it’s a Golden Age that’s rarely seen since ancient times. Many sons of God have been born in various places!”</p><p>“My land of ten thousand demons has forty thousand Sons of heaven!”</p><p>As the crowd discussed, some of the geniuses from the land of infinite demons proudly said.</p><p>It was already very shocking that there were four children of God in one place.</p><p>“How many sons of God are there in your Yuan mountain?”</p><p>Someone asked the heaven’s favorites from Mount Yuan.</p><p>“Six of you!”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from Mount Yuan replied.</p><p>“Six? You’re just bragging, how can there be six of you in your Yuan mountain!”</p><p>The paragons of the land of myriad demons immediately became suspicious.</p><p>Among the ten lands of the primordial realm, apart from the forsaken land, the strength of Yuan mountain was considered weak. Now, the heaven’s favorite of Yuan mountain actually said that there were six sons of heaven in Yuan mountain, which immediately aroused suspicion.</p><p>Many people cast contemptuous looks at the yuan mountain.</p><p>Being looked down upon by others, the heaven’s favorites of Yuan mountain were unhappy.</p><p>of course! Wei Tiandao said, there are indeed six sons of heaven in our Mount Yuan. They are the son of chaos, the son of eternity, the son of death, the son of spacetime, the son of life, and the Son of Samsara!</p><p>“What? There’s a son of chaos in Yuan mountain?”</p><p>it’s getting more and more outrageous. It’s possible to say that there are other sons of heaven, but it’s most likely a lie to say that there’s a son of chaos!</p><p>Some people looked at him with disdain.</p><p>Although the ten ultimate maxims were equally famous and ranked side by side, there were actually two maxims that were the rarest and had the lowest probability of appearing in history.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos and the laws of fate..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
