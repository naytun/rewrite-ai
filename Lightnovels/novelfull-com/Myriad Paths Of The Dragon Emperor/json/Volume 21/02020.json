At the same time, the earth trembled, as if thousands of soldiers and horses were charging out of the valley.</p><p>“The strongest is an Emperor-to-be!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. He took a step forward and entered the valley.</p><p>In front of him, a pack of giant wolves charged at Lu Ming. There were at least a few hundred of them. There were bright Saints, great saints, and even absolute Saints.</p><p>The giant wolves ‘bodies were pitch-black, and they emitted a thick demonic aura. Their eyes were filled with ferocity as they pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and his Saint energy condensed into long Spears.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air, emitting a sharp whistling sound.</p><p>Instantly, the giant wolves were nailed to the ground by the spear.</p><p>No matter if it was an absolute Saint or a great saint or a bright Saint, they were all the same. They were killed in one move.</p><p>In an instant, dozens of giant wolves were nailed to death.</p><p>The other giant wolves could not help but pause and stop.</p><p>After reaching the Saint realm, the giant wolf naturally had a high level of intelligence. It looked at Lu Ming with fear.</p><p>“If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. His eyes were like two black vortexes as he cast the soul illusion. At this moment, he seemed to have turned into a god of death in the eyes of the giant wolves, slaughtering all living beings.</p><p>Wuwuwu…</p><p>The rest of the giant wolves all cried out in fear and slowly retreated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the depths of the valley, shaking the entire Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that there was a huge cave in the depths of the valley. At that moment, an exceptionally huge Wolf was walking out of the valley.</p><p>This giant wolf was at least a hundred meters tall, like a small mountain.</p><p>Its entire body was pitch-black, as if it was cast from steel, and its demonic Qi was incomparably dense.</p><p>Emperor-to-be!</p><p>Lu Ming had sensed that the giant wolf was at the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>It was obvious that this giant wolf was the king of this pack of giant wolves. It took a step forward and swept its cold gaze across the pack of wolves, causing the other giant wolves to tremble and prostrate themselves.</p><p>“Human, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Giant wolf King looked at Lu Ming and said in a cold voice.</p><p>The next moment, giant wolf King kicked its four legs and its huge body pounced toward Lu Ming, casting a large shadow.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the giant wolf pounced in front of Lu Ming, its claws as sharp as knives, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His holy power surged and his figure suddenly rushed out like a beam of light at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming was on top of the giant wolf’s head and he punched it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The punch landed directly on the wolf’s head. The wolf wailed and its huge body fell to the ground. The ground shook and the valley rumbled. A huge pit appeared on the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming had not used his full strength in this punch, so the giant wolf did not die. It roared and struggled madly.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped down and the giant wolf wailed. Its head hit the ground again, creating a huge pit.</p><p>“If you continue to resist, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his entire body exuding an icy cold killing intent.</p><p>Giant wolf King shuddered. It knew that it was far from being Lu Ming’s match. If Lu Ming wanted to kill it, it would be as easy as turning his hand.</p><p>“Human, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>Giant wolf King asked.</p><p>I’m going to cultivate here for a while. After a while, 1’11 leave. You guys just stay outside!</p><p>“If you don’t agree, I’ll kill all of you, and 1 can still cultivate here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Are you really going to leave after a while?”</p><p>Giant wolf King asked.</p><p>“Nonsense, who would be willing to stay in this broken place!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He took a step forward and walked toward the cave in the depths of the valley.</p><p>In that cave, the demonic Qi was rolling and extremely dense.</p><p>&Nbsp; giant wolf King howled a few times, but in the end, he had no choice but to stay outside the valley with his Wolf Pack.</p><p>“Such dense demonic Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the cave and raised his eyebrows. The demonic Qi here was thicker than he had imagined. It was almost tangible.</p><p>“Eh? That’s the demon origin fruit!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a small tree growing on one of the walls of the cave. On the small tree, there were three fruits that were as black as ink.</p><p>The main focus of the Dayan elixir Hall was elixir refinement. Lu Ming had naturally read a large number of books in the Dayan elixir Hall. He was very familiar with all kinds of precious medicinal herbs and heavenly and earthly treasures. Naturally, he recognized the fruit at a glance.</p><p>The demonic origin fruit was an extremely rare and precious fruit. It was very useful for those who cultivated demonic Arts. Consuming it could purify demonic Qi and increase one’s strength.</p><p>However, these three demonic origin fruits were clearly not fully ripe yet. However, it seemed that they were not far from ripening.</p><p>according to the records, the demonic origin fruit can only grow in places with extremely dense demonic Qi. It’s extraordinary that the demonic origin fruit can grow here!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and then sized up the cave.</p><p>The cave was huge and led all the way inside. Lu Ming followed the path and soon, he made a discovery.</p><p>There was a small pond with water as black as ink, with bubbles constantly popping out.</p><p>This water was an extremely dense demonic Qi.</p><p>this is the Devil’s Pool. There’s actually a Devil’s Pool here. No wonder the devil Qi is so dense!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The Devil’s Pool was the birthplace of devil Qi. There would be an endless stream of devil Qi gushing out. Although it was only a small Devil’s Pool, the devil Qi it contained was already very rich. No wonder it could produce the devil origin fruit.</p><p>No wonder there was a pack of giant wolves guarding this place.</p><p>With a thought, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming activated his cultivation technique and controlled the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb the demonic Qi.</p><p>The demonic Qi here was extremely dense, and the effect was better than directly absorbing the raw gemstones.</p><p>The demonic Qi in the surroundings gathered toward the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body in a frenzy, turning into energy for storage.</p><p>Just like that, the days passed by.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed, and the energy in the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had reached about three percent.</p><p>This speed was already very fast. In the past, Lu Ming had spent more than half a year to store twelve percent of the energy in the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>On this day, a group of people arrived outside the valley.</p><p>These people carried demonic sabers on their backs and their bodies were filled with a murderous aura. Their eyes were as sharp as blades.</p><p>counting the days, the demon origin fruits here are about to ripen. It’s time to pick them!</p><p>The leader of the group, a burly man, spoke.</p><p>This person had a strong aura and had the cultivation of an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“However, there’s a pack of demonic wolves in this Valley. It’s not easy to deal with them!”</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>what’s so difficult about it? there’s only one emperor-to-be mo Wolf in this group of mo wolves. We have three Emperor-to-be experts. It’s enough to annihilate this group of demon wolves!</p><p>The burly man in the lead said coldly.</p><p>“Not bad! We’ll kill our way in in a while!”</p><p>Another Emperor-to-be said.</p><p>These people started to wait outside the valley.</p><p>However, they didn’t know that there was another group of people looking at them from the clouds in the distance..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
