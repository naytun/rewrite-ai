It collided with the demonic light, and the sky rumbled.</p><p>“So it’s you. Hand over the ancient demonic coffin!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor hollered as his body flickered and he charged towards his opponent, unleashing a terrifying attack.</p><p>The other party wasn’t afraid at all. His entire body was engulfed in demonic light as he engaged in a battle with the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Someone shouted, and they retreated frantically.</p><p>That black shadow was definitely a great emperor. The shockwaves from a battle between great emperors were too terrifying. If one was sucked in, death would be the only outcome.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had retreated thousands of miles.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In that area, there were constant rumbles. The void was completely shattered, showing how intense the battle was.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned pale. They didn’t expect to encounter such a terrifying expert the moment they entered.</p><p>At the same time, they recalled the words of the ancient Emperor. Could it be that the ancient demonic coffin had been stolen by this figure?</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. He hoped that the ancient Emperor could defeat his opponent and take back the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>If even the ancient Emperor couldn’t take it back, then he would have no hope at all.</p><p>“Then… What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed in a trembling voice.</p><p>He didn’t need to shout, everyone saw it.</p><p>In front of them, a black wind was sweeping toward them.</p><p>The gale covered a very wide area, as if it was covering the sky and the earth.</p><p>No, it was not a Gale, but a type of insect.</p><p>A kind of pitch-black insects was endless. They gathered together and flapped their wings, bringing with them endless gales that swept toward Lu Ming and the others. From afar, it looked like a pitch-black Gale.</p><p>these are demonic beetles. My God, why are there so many of them? ”</p><p>An old man whose hair was about to fall out exclaimed. He was an</p><p>Emperor-to-be, but his face was extremely ugly.</p><p>Demonic beetles were a very terrifying type of demonic insects. They might not be strong individually, but when gathered together, they were terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, the demonic beetles that appeared here were endless.</p><p>those above the martial Supreme realm, block the demonic beetles. Those below the martial Supreme realm, run!</p><p>The voice of the ancient Emperor rang out from afar.</p><p>They didn’t dare to disobey the great Emperor’s orders.</p><p>All the martial sovereigns, including the Azure Demon King, rushed toward the demonic beetles.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Dozens of martial sovereigns attacked at the same time. There were true sovereigns and void sovereigns, and their power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Large numbers of demonic beetles were killed and fell to the ground like raindrops. Many of them were turned into ashes by the martial sovereign’s terrifying power.</p><p>However, there were too many demonic beetles. They were a dense mass and seemed endless. It was impossible to kill them all. There were still many that managed to break through the martial Supremes ‘encirclement and charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Hundreds of emperors-to-be fled in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed in one direction.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>The wind whistled as the countless demonic beetles formed an arc, trying to surround them.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength and his speed was faster than many Emperor-to-be’S. He rushed toward an opening.</p><p>There were no demonic beetles there.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming was about to break out of the demonic beetle’s encirclement, his expression changed slightly.</p><p>The demonic beetles had also appeared in front of them.</p><p>However, there weren’t many of them, and they couldn’t be compared to the endless demonic beetles.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and rushed over.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh…</p><p>Each demonic beetle was the size of a fist. Their bodies were pitch-black as if they were made of black iron. They were like pitch-black cannonballs as they charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>This combat sword was a monarch weapon!</p><p>To deal with these demonic beetles, a combat sword was the best weapon. It was more useful than a spear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his combat sword and dozens of demonic beetles were cut in half.</p><p>However, compared to the densely packed numbers, a few dozen was nothing.</p><p>There were still many demonic beetles that charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his Saint energy and combined it with the law of chaos to form a protective shield around his body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The demonic beetles crashed into the protective shield, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>However, it could not break through Lu Ming’s defense for the time being.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the monarch weapon sword and slashed continuously, killing a large number of demonic beetles. In a few breaths, hundreds of demonic beetles fell to the ground.</p><p>These demonic beetles were not very powerful individually, but there were too many of them. They charged at Lu Ming fearlessly and crashed into his protective shield.</p><p>If this went on, Lu Ming’s holy power would be consumed very quickly. Once his holy power was exhausted, he would be in danger.</p><p>At this moment, the other emperors-to-be were also attacked by the demonic beetles.</p><p>They also did their best to charge forward, constantly killing demonic beetles as they charged forward.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his sword. With every swing, a large number of demonic beetles were killed. He charged forward quickly. Wherever he passed, demonic beetles fell like rain.</p><p>Fortunately, this was not the place where the demonic beetles gathered. It was only the edge, so there were fewer demonic beetles.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming broke through the encirclement and flew forward at top speed.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>Behind him, the wind howled and countless demonic beetles were chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming buried his head and flew madly. He flew for at least a few hours before the demonic beetles behind him disappeared without a trace.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was also completely separated from the rest.</p><p>“Look at the map!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the map that the ancient Emperor had given him and infused his Saint energy into it. The Jade card glowed and a picture floated in the air.</p><p>However, there was nothing unusual on the map except for a bright spot.</p><p>Lu Ming made a comparison. The position of this light spot was where he was. This light spot was him.</p><p>it seems that only by activating this Jade token will there be light spots floating on it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Now that everyone was in the middle of a great battle, there were naturally no specks of light floating around.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming realized that he was lost. He had been flying around randomly and changing his direction constantly. At this moment, he had no idea where he was.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and flew forward.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming did not meet a single person or any living creature. It was as if there was only one person left in the entire world.</p><p>In the past few days, he had already flown who knew how far.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming heard faint shouts coming from the front.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was because these battle cries did not come from one or two people, or even dozens of people. It was like the roars of an Army of thousands of soldiers.</p><p>How could there be thousands of soldiers and horses here?</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a curious look.</p><p>Then, he used the divine breath technique to completely conceal his aura. He stuck close to the ground and rushed toward the source of the sound..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
