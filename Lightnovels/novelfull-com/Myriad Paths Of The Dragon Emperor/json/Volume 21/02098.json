One could imagine how intense this would be, and the situation would change.</p><p>It didn’t necessarily mean that one was strong enough to stay until the end. It required luck.</p><p>Of course, when one was strong enough, one could sweep through others and stay until the end without luck.</p><p>Moreover, there was a prerequisite, and that was that the number of people working together to fight the enemy could not exceed three.</p><p>This was also a form of protection, and also a form of restriction.</p><p>He was afraid that many experts would join forces. If more than a dozen top experts joined forces and swept the others, how could others play?</p><p>With only three of them working together, the restrictions would be huge.</p><p>“Moreover, the teams can not join forces against each other!”</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor added. This made some people think, and the hopes of the teams working together were destroyed.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all for the rules. Let’s begin!”</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More than 1000 Young heaven’s favorites flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>However, after they flew up to the fighting ring, they separated from each other and stared at each other cautiously.</p><p>The fighting stage was huge, with a length and width of a hundred miles. It was spacious for more than a thousand people.</p><p>Countless people were watching nervously from all directions.</p><p>“Let’s join forces!”</p><p>“How about we join forces?”</p><p>On the fighting ring, there was no battle at the first moment. Instead, they communicated with each other, planning to join forces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Their figures flickered, and many people began to join forces.</p><p>With three people in a group, there were many more groups on the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Qiu Yue, and Huang Ling had joined forces.</p><p>Bubbles, Huang Ling, and Luo Tianyi were in a group.</p><p>With the bubble as the core.</p><p>Then, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and Qiu Yue formed a group.</p><p>Long Chen, desolate li, and Luo Xiang were in a group.</p><p>Ouyang Wushuang and the two powerful King physiques who had joined the Dragon League in the yuan mountain were in one group.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming saw that Wu Liang, Wu Yue, and Wu Chen were in a group.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible for everyone to form groups of three.</p><p>Some people had two people, while some only had one person.</p><p>Death blade, Mu yang, Yuan Xin, and ancient devil were all alone. Their eyes were cold as they looked around.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar rang out. Someone had started to make a move.</p><p>“You’re the ones who are going down!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent collision, and a great battle broke out.</p><p>Pulling one hair would move the whole body. One person moving, all moving.</p><p>The fighting ring was suddenly plunged into a chaotic battle.</p><p>As long as he could knock the opponent off the stage, he would have a higher chance of remaining on the stage.</p><p>“Brat, go down!”</p><p>Someone had set their eyes on Lu Ming. It was a group of three.</p><p>The battle-power of these three wasn’t weak. The one in the lead had a King body and his cultivation had reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>As for the other two, although they didn’t have King physiques, their spiritual bodies were upper-grade heaven spiritual bodies, and their cultivation had also reached the absolute Saint perfection.</p><p>The three of them launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming at the same time, wanting to knock him down in one fell swoop.</p><p>It was a pity that they were too slow when they passed through the passage earlier and did not see Lu Ming display the death law. Naturally, they did not know that Lu Ming was a Son of God.</p><p>During this period of time, many people had asked around about some of the famous sons of God, including their appearances. However, they had never seen a person like Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the ones who are going down!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the three of them, his eyes filled with the aura of death.</p><p>The three’s attacks instantly crumbled under the death Qi.</p><p>not good, it’s the law of death. This is a child of death!</p><p>The three of them roared in shock and wanted to retreat.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming cast death’s eye, the death aura became even thicker and enveloped the three of them.</p><p>The three of them immediately let out shrill screams, as if their vitality was about to be taken away.</p><p>“Spare us, we admit defeat, we admit defeat!”</p><p>The three of them shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat, and the air of death disappeared. The three of them rushed down the fighting ring in a hurry, afraid that Lu Ming would kill them.</p><p>The hundred-mile-wide fighting ring looked very big when there was no battle, but it felt very small after the chaotic battle.</p><p>With their current strength, they could travel more than a hundred miles in an instant.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and the others were in groups of three. Their performance was very eye-catching and their strength was shocking.</p><p>In the past three years, they had been brought to the corresponding secret places by Emperor Wu Xiang and the others to cultivate, and their progress could only be described as god-like.</p><p>Bubbles ’cultivation base had long entered the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>There were also people like Huang Ling, Long Chen, and Huang Li, all of whom were Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Only Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were slightly weaker, but they were also in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage. Their mastery of their nomological laws had reached 99%, only one step away from becoming an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>However, they were the children of God and had shocking battle power. They were even stronger than the Emperor-to-be King body.</p><p>Wherever they passed, experts were knocked off the fighting stage one by one. Not many people could match them.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming’s disciple, get lost!”</p><p>Mu yang had his eyes on Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and Qiu Yue.</p><p>His body flickered as he charged towards the three of them.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Qiu Yue reminded. The cold and heat in her body were intertwined. One side was hot, while the other side was cold. They created a terrifying destructive force that blasted toward Mu yang.</p><p>At the same time, the light of laws covered her entire body. A yin-yang law flowed like a long river.</p><p>“Green wood raises the sky!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang waved her hand and an ancient green tree appeared. It was so huge that it covered the sky and pressed down on Muyang.</p><p>At the same time, Ouyang Moli wielded the reincarnation halberd and slashed out. Six reincarnation vortexes followed the halberd and slashed toward Mu yang.</p><p>“You want to stop me? die!”</p><p>Mu yang shouted. With a wave of his hand, the void law trembled and rays of void light shot towards the three.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOA/1!</p><p>With three loud bangs, Qiu Yue, Lu Xiangxiang, and Ouyang Moli’s attacks all collapsed and turned into nothingness under the void law.</p><p>It had to be said that Muyang’s strength was amazing. He had already begun to develop a small world and stood at the peak of Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Qiu Yue had a King body. Although she was also at the peak of Emperor-to-be, she couldn’t fight against Mu yang.</p><p>As for Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli, they were not Emperor-to-be yet. Even if they joined forces, they were no match for Muyang.</p><p>“Your master is dead. I’ll send you to accompany him!”</p><p>Mu yang sneered as he charged towards Lu Xiangxiang and the other two.</p><p>The three of them tried their best to resist, but they were still completely at a disadvantage and in imminent danger.</p><p>Not far away, bubbles and the others wanted to help but there was a rule that three people would form a group. No one else could interfere and they could only be anxious.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Not only did Muyang send assassins to kill him, but now, he also wanted to deal with his disciple. In his heart, Muyang was already on his must-kill list..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
