Under his demonic flames, Lu Ming would be reduced to ashes.</p><p>In addition, they were under the magma Lake. The magma here was something that even he was afraid of. Not only was the temperature astonishingly high, but the pressure was also very shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming would be dead for sure if it was any one of the two, let alone when they were combined. Lu Ming had no chance at all.</p><p>At this moment, not only were Lu Ming’s four limbs burned to ashes in the flames, but the rest of his body was also about to turn into ashes.</p><p>The Azure Demon King laughed coldly as he shot towards the lava.</p><p>Although he did not obtain any opportunities from Lu Ming, it was not bad to be able to kill him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Azure Demon King had rushed up the lava lake and flew above the darkness.</p><p>“How’s that kid?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>we’re dead. Let’s go. We’ll explore this ancient city and leave!</p><p>The ashen Demon King said. With a flash of his silhouette, he left the place, and the other three followed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had indeed encountered the greatest crisis in his life.</p><p>At this moment, his physical body was about to be completely turned into ashes.</p><p>The most important thing was that he could no longer mobilize his strength and could not charge forward.</p><p>His body was completely covered in demonic fire. It was a peak true Emperor demonic fire that wouldn’t be extinguished until it burned its target to ashes.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly feel that his physical body was collapsing, disintegrating, and being burned to ashes.</p><p>There were three wisps of chaotic Qi in his body.</p><p>At this moment, three wisps of chaotic Qi slithered like three small snakes and then rushed into one of the Saint hearts.</p><p>“Enter the Saint heart!”</p><p>Lu Ming used his soul power to move the Dayan elixir furnace and the mountain and river diagram into another Saint heart. Then, Lu Ming’s soul also rushed into another Saint heart.</p><p>As long as the soul was not destroyed, there was always hope of resurrection.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming’s body was completely burned into ashes by the demonic fire. He disappeared without a trace, leaving only two Saint hearts floating there.</p><p>After the demonic flame burned Lu Ming’s body to ashes, it seemed to have lost its target and finally disappeared.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>In the Saint heart, Lu Ming’s soul could still sense everything outside. At that moment, he realized that the lava outside was squeezing his two Saint hearts.</p><p>The two Saint hearts collided with each other.</p><p>The lava outside wrapped around the two Saint hearts and pressed on them, as if it was going to crush them. The terrifying temperature in the lava was also constantly burning them, as if it was going to melt them.</p><p>Lu Ming was worried. If his two Saint hearts were melted, he would have no chance at all.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and glanced at the Dayan elixir furnace floating in the Saint heart.</p><p>If his Saint heart had been broken, leaving the Dayan elixir furnace here, he was afraid that it would not have been able to withstand the terrible heat outside.</p><p>Although the Dayan elixir furnace was wonderful, it was also dangerous in such an environment for a long time.</p><p>The original purpose of this trip was to save Qiu Yue, but before she could wake up, she was in danger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, his two Saint hearts trembled, and one of their outer corners shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul trembled violently when a corner of his Saint heart crumbled. It was as if a terrifying flame had enveloped his soul.</p><p>“Could it be that I’m really going to die Here today?”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind. At this moment, he felt the aura of death. His soul trembled and his consciousness was blurry. In the end, his vision turned black and he did not know anything.</p><p>Only his two Saint hearts were being pressed by the terrifying lava.</p><p>However, a strange scene happened.</p><p>The parts of the two Saint hearts that had crumbled did not dissipate into nothingness. Instead, they stuck together and flew back into the Saint hearts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As the lava pressed and burned, more and more of the two Saint hearts crumbled, but the fragments and powder fused back together and flew back to the two Saint hearts.</p><p>It was as if the two Saint hearts were about to merge together.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had no idea about all this.</p><p>Following that, his Saint heart continued to shatter and then merge back together.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>Three days ago, he had two Saint hearts, but this time, he had only one.</p><p>It became a bigger Saint heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the two Saint hearts became one, there was a wonderful fluctuation. Then, the bigger Saint heart started to spin rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, a strange power was produced in the Saint heart. The energy in the surrounding lava was constantly gathering toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A few days passed just like that.</p><p>A wonderful scene appeared. With the Saint heart as the center, the outline of a body appeared.</p><p>This was just an outline, not a real entity, made of energy.</p><p>When the outline of the body appeared, three wisps of chaotic Qi flew out of his Saint heart and swam around the outline of the body. At the same time, the energy in the magma continued to gather and pour into the Saint heart. Then, it spread out from the Saint heart and poured into the outline of the body.</p><p>The outline of his body was slowly becoming more and more solid.</p><p>Reforging his body!</p><p>He was reforging his fleshly body!</p><p>When the two Saint hearts merged into one, they were actually reforging their bodies on their own. Moreover, they were reforging their bodies with the energy in the lava.</p><p>The process of reforging the body was very slow.</p><p>Just like that, three whole months passed.</p><p>In the lava, an intact body appeared.</p><p>This physical body was Lu Ming’s.</p><p>However, this body was a little different from the previous one.</p><p>There was a fiery red color on his skin, like a burning flame.</p><p>The curves of his body were perfect, but he seemed to be filled with explosive power.</p><p>The three wisps of chaotic Qi had also fused perfectly with his body.</p><p>At this moment, the body’s fingers moved, and it slowly opened its eyes.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around in surprise.</p><p>Finally, he looked at his own body and was very shocked.</p><p>He remembered clearly that he had been attacked by the Cang Demon King and his body had been reduced to ashes in the demonic fire. Even his Saint heart had been crushed by the lava, his soul had been shaken, and his consciousness had fallen into darkness.</p><p>He didn’t expect to find his body still there when he woke up.</p><p>“No, this body is a little different from before …”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming felt something strange.</p><p>He realized that although this body was also made of flesh and blood, it was much stronger than before. The three strands of chaotic Qi had perfectly fused together and were filled with explosive power.</p><p>At the same time, this body seemed to be unafraid of the surrounding lava. It was as if he was one with the surrounding lava and the surrounding lava was ineffective against him.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming’s physical body was so powerful that he was not afraid of the magma’s temperature. It was because his physical body was Reforged by the energy here. They had the same energy, so he was not afraid.</p><p>If it was any other force of the same level, Lu Ming would definitely not be able to withstand it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
