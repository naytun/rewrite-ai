There were only tall and majestic city walls. There seemed to be a force on the city walls that prevented him from going up.</p><p>In other words, it was impossible to get out of the city wall.</p><p>this ancient city can’t only have one city gate, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Most large cities would not have only one gate. Even if they had fewer, they would have at least two.</p><p>Normally, there were four, eight, or even more.</p><p>perhaps there’s a city gate in the depths of the ancient city, in the direction of the city gate!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. He planned to enter the depths of the ancient city and pass through it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to set off to the depths of the ancient city, some figures descended outside the ancient city.</p><p>One of them had eight people, four of whom were martial sovereigns. The one leading them was an old man, who was the Azure Demon King.</p><p>The Azure Demon King held immense power in the eternal devil nation. He was of the same generation as the eternal Emperor and was a peak true Emperor. He was highly regarded by the eternal Emperor, and many people in the eternal devil nation would give him face.</p><p>They had only killed Lu Ming, a junior. Moreover, the Azure Demon King had promised a generous reward. Naturally, many people followed the Azure Demon King to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The Azure Demon King arrived and swept his cold gaze across the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>“It’s like this…”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man trembled as he explained the situation in the ancient city.</p><p>“An armor?”</p><p>A glint flashed in the Azure Demon King’s eyes, followed by a cold killing intent.</p><p>They had lost so many experts because of Lu Ming. Lu Ming deserved to die.</p><p>those above the rank of martial Supreme, follow me. The rest of you, stay outside!</p><p>The Azure Demon King instructed before flying into the ancient city.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was an expert at the peak of the true Emperor realm. He was too strong. In the hands of the Azure Demon King, those demonic spirits were like ants. With a single palm strike, a large number of demonic spirits were destroyed.</p><p>They easily charged through the demon spirit Army and into the ancient city.</p><p>split up into groups of two and look for Lu Ming. Once you find him, send out the news immediately!</p><p>The Azure Demon King said.</p><p>The people who had come with the Azure Demon King this time were no small matter.</p><p>There were a total of three people. One of them was a true Emperor, and the other two were void emperors. However, they were all five star void emperors and above. Their strength was much stronger than that of the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man followed the true Emperor to the right.</p><p>The two powerful void thearchs went to the left, while the Azure Demon King went to the middle, searching for Lu Ming inch by inch.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already passed through the center of the ancient city and was heading deeper into the city.</p><p>In contrast to the direction of the city gate, this side was indeed the depths of the ancient city.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the depths of the ancient city, he felt a little creeped out. He kept having a sense of danger.</p><p>the buildings here are more majestic. They look like small castles!</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>The buildings here were indeed more majestic. They were pitch-black and filled with the aura of time.</p><p>Lu Ming moved forward carefully. The armor was following him closely.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Suddenly, a building in front of them started to shake.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and stopped.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Then, the building started to shake again, as if a giant beast was attacking the castle.</p><p>After a few vibrations, the sound disappeared again.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He activated the divine breath technique and restrained his aura to the extreme. Then, he continued to move forward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>When Lu Ming passed by the building, there was a loud roar from the building. Then, the sound of iron chains clashing could be heard.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming saw a claw reaching out from the building.</p><p>This claw was like the claw of a wild beast. It was covered in black scales, and there were black chains wrapped around the claw.</p><p>The claw was as big as a house and it grabbed at Lu Ming, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the claw suddenly expanded and became longer and bigger at an alarming speed. It grabbed at Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was about to be caught, Lu Ming controlled the prison-suppressing stele. The prison-suppressing stele glowed and shot towards the claw.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The claw was covered by the light of the prison-guarding stele, making a sizzling sound and black smoke.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Another loud roar came from the building as the claw retracted.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated continuously. After he had retreated a certain distance, he heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to find that there were living creatures in the building. It looked as if it was locked.</p><p>This ancient city seemed to have existed for countless years. Why were there still living beings here?</p><p>Could it be that the creature in the building was locked up by the original owner of the ancient city?</p><p>However, to be able to survive for so long without dying, it was definitely extremely powerful.</p><p>“Let’s change the direction!”</p><p>Lu Ming left the place and walked to the right for a while before he continued to move forward.</p><p>In front of them, there were still many huge buildings.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully passed through some buildings but he did not discover anything unusual. It seemed that not every building had living creatures.</p><p>Even if there were, it was possible that they had already died after such a long time. There were not many who could have survived.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s good luck did not last long.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, a claw stretched out from a building. This claw was even bigger than the previous one. It was covered with black scales and had long nails, like the claw of a demon.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with the prison-suppressing stele and retreated quickly. Fortunately, the prison-guarding stele had a strong restraining effect on this kind of claw. As soon as the claw came into contact with the light of the prison-guarding stele, it quickly retreated back into the building.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a distance and wandered around the area.</p><p>It seemed that all the buildings in this area had those terrifying creatures.</p><p>He didn’t know which ones had it and which ones didn’t.</p><p>Even with the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline, it would not be safe for him to force his way through.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>At this moment, a few figures were rushing in Lu Ming’s direction at top speed.</p><p>When the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline glowed, he was discovered even though he was far away.</p><p>Gang Demon King and the others rushed towards Lu Ming at top speed, with him being the fastest.</p><p>Although he was a peak true Emperor and was forbidden from flying in the ancient city, his speed was still shocking.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was hesitating whether he should charge in, he suddenly had a bad feeling. He looked behind him and saw a figure flashing toward him at high speed. In an instant, the figure appeared not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Demon King Cang!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and the armor charged at the Azure Demon King.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Azure Demon King was so powerful that he sent the armor flying.</p><p>While he was calling for the armor to take action, Lu Ming had already rushed into the depths of the ancient city..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
