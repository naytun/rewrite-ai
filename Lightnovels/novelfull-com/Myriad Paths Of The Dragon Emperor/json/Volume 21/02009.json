Figures flickered and appeared beside Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>He was a teacher of the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>The teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy included both the void Emperor and the true Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The auras of the teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Academy clashed with the auras of the experts from the Heng family. A terrifying collision occurred, causing the air to rumble.</p><p>The commotion here was too shocking, and it spread far and wide.</p><p>Outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy, many people felt the pressure as heavy as a mountain. They all rose into the air and looked over.</p><p>the experts of the he clan and Heng clan are confronting the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>“It seems to be because of Lu Ming!”</p><p>he clan and Heng clan, hehe, they’re really shameless. They came out now and even dared to attack the yuan mountain Saint Academy. They’re just deceiving the two great emperors of the yuan mountain Saint Academy and the injured Emperor Wu Xiang!</p><p>Many people didn’t like the he family and the Heng family, but they kept their voices low for fear of being heard by the experts of the two families.</p><p>So what if he was unhappy? The he clan and the Heng clan were great emperor-level forces with great emperors in charge. There were even more true emperors and void emperors.</p><p>“It’s really lively today!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from afar. Then, everyone saw many beams of light cutting through the void like divine swords, flying towards the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Within each rainbow light was a powerhouse with an extremely shocking aura.</p><p>so strong! There are so many martial sovereigns!</p><p>Someone exclaimed with a grave expression.</p><p>When the rainbow light faded, a group of experts descended into the yuan mountain sacred Academy. They formed a triangular formation with the he and Heng families, surrounding Lu Ming and the rest in the middle.</p><p>“Daluo heaven sect!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed and gasped.</p><p>The people of the Daluo heaven sect had also come, another great emperor-level force.</p><p>your Daluo heaven sect also wants to join in the fun? “</p><p>A teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy spoke.</p><p>it has nothing to do with you. We’re here to kill Lu Ming today. He killed the king body of the Daluo heaven sect. He must die!</p><p>A true Emperor of the Daluo heaven sect said coldly.</p><p>The king physique he was talking about was naturally Luo pokong.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, many people’s faces turned even uglier.</p><p>The Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect were all</p><p>Emperor-level forces. Each of them was extremely powerful and had a deep foundation. Each of them was very terrifying. Now, the three major forces were working together to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Although there were some experts on Lu Ming’s side, in addition to the teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Institute, it was impossible for them to fight against the three major forces. There was a huge difference in power.</p><p>If they fought, they would probably be completely wiped out.</p><p>today, since Lu Ming is in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the yuan mountain sacred Academy will definitely protect him!</p><p>A teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy said.</p><p>in that case, I’ll destroy the yuan mountain sacred Academy as well!</p><p>A true Emperor from the Heng family spoke. His voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Today, the three great forces had arrived together, giving them confidence. Even if the yuan mountain sacred Academy was at its peak and the three great emperors were present, they wouldn’t be afraid. Not to mention, there was only one great emperor Wu Xiang left.</p><p>The people who were watching from afar were all shocked.</p><p>If the yuan mountain sacred Academy wanted to interfere, they would even want to destroy the yuan mountain sacred Academy. They were too tyrannical.</p><p>“Why are you talking so much nonsense with them? Directly annihilate them!”</p><p>He Hao shouted, instigating the crowd to attack.</p><p>Suddenly, the powerhouses of the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect released their power. Their killing intent flashed, and they were about to launch a thunderous attack.</p><p>“Prepare for battle!”</p><p>One of the true emperors from the yuan mountain sacred Academy roared.</p><p>The experts on Lu Ming’s side took out their sovereign weapons and prepared to fight.</p><p>At this moment, a powerful pressure spread out.</p><p>Even the true Emperor’s expression changed drastically when faced with this pressure. It was as if a great disaster was about to befall them.</p><p>High up in the sky, the void split open, and a figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p>“Emperor Wu Xiang!”</p><p>Someone said with a grave expression.</p><p>This figure was none other than Emperor formless.</p><p>this is the yuan mountain sacred Academy. I won’t let you touch Lu Ming. You can leave!</p><p>Emperor formless spoke in a gentle voice. It wasn’t overbearing, but it carried a Supreme dignity that no one dared to refute.</p><p>“Wuxiang, I’m afraid you can’t protect him today!”</p><p>As soon as Emperor formless finished speaking, a dignified voice rang out.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in the sky. This figure was shrouded in endless halos, but many people could still tell who it was with a single glance.</p><p>The great emperor of the Heng clan!</p><p>The three Emperor-level forces had come prepared.</p><p>Now, the great emperor had arrived.</p><p>he killed my Daluo heaven sect’s King body. No one can save him!</p><p>Then, another voice was heard. This voice was cold and overbearing, with a cold killing intent.</p><p>In another direction, another figure appeared. This figure was shrouded in endless black light. The figure appeared and disappeared, but the strength of the aura was earth-shattering.</p><p>The great emperor of the Daluo heaven sect!</p><p>The Emperor of the Daluo heaven sect was called Emperor tianluo.</p><p>The two emperors ‘auras were extremely powerful. They were like two universes that would never be destroyed. The pressure they gave off was too strong.</p><p>it’s over. Lu Ming is really over today. There’s only one great emperor in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. He can’t protect Lu Ming at all!</p><p>that’s right. The great emperor of the he clan has yet to appear. Even if the three great emperors of the yuan mountain sacred Academy are here, Lu Ming will still be in danger today!</p><p>“Lu Ming is finished today. He’s going to die!”</p><p>“It’s a pity that he’s a peerless hero of his generation!”</p><p>In the distance, many people sighed.</p><p>At this moment, many people were on Lu Ming’s side. The he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect were too despicable. During the war with the evil god tribe, the three major forces did not appear.</p><p>Of course, they supported Lu Ming in their hearts, but no one would really help him. That would undoubtedly be courting death.</p><p>However, it was a pity.</p><p>“Then i’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Just as Emperor tianluo appeared, another voice was heard. Then, a terrifying sword light flashed.</p><p>This sword light was too dazzling and incomparably stunning. It came from beyond the sky and split the entire sky into two.</p><p>Emperor tianluo’s expression changed. With a roar, endless light shot up. He waved his hand, and a mysterious aura filled the air.</p><p>It was the aura of the great Dao!</p><p>Great emperors controlled great DAOs, the great DAOs of heaven and earth!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge seal floated in the air. It looked like Luo cangqiong’s divine seal of deprivation, but it was much more brilliant than it.</p><p>The huge seal flew out and collided with the bright sword radiance.</p><p>At this moment, the dazzling light was so blinding that many people could not open their eyes.</p><p>When the light disappeared, an old man appeared in front of Emperor tianluo.</p><p>It was a very old man with a walking stick. He looked like an ordinary old man.</p><p>Uncle Kong!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that uncle Kong had been paying attention to him. Now that Lu Ming was in danger, uncle Kong still stood up for him.</p><p>“Who is this person? Could it be that the sword light just now was from him?” how terrifying! He’s also a great emperor, but I’ve never heard of him before!</p><p>it seems like they’re here to help Lu Ming. There’s actually a great emperor behind Lu Ming!</p><p>Many people looked at uncle Kong in shock..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
