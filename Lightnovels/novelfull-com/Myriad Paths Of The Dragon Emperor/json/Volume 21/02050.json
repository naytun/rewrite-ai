He had challenged the ancient devil because he wanted to spar with it. However, he wanted to take the opportunity to show off his strength and attract the attention of the ancient Emperor. This would give him a chance to make a request.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had achieved his goal.</p><p>“Your Majesty, Lu Ming would like to borrow the eternal demonic coffin for a month. I hope your Majesty can grant him his wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the ancient Emperor and stated his request.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place fell silent. Many people looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming actually made this request.</p><p>The ancient demonic coffin was the National treasure of the ancient devil nation, and only the ancient Emperor had the right to control it.</p><p>Lu Ming was really bold to ask to borrow the eternal demonic coffin for a month.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s heart could not help but tighten. He was worried for Lu Ming. “Impudent! Lu Ming, don’t think that you can take advantage of me just because you have some talent and have made some small contributions. The ancient demonic coffin is a precious treasure. It’s not something you can use!” The Azure Demon King seized the opportunity to step out and berate him. However, Lu Ming did not even spare him a glance. His gaze was fixed on the ancient Emperor.</p><p>The ancient Emperor frowned as well. “Lu Ming, change your request. As long as it’s within my means, I’ll definitely help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank. Even the ancient Emperor did not agree?</p><p>Your Majesty, I’m borrowing the ancient demonic coffin to save someone. I have a family member whose soul is injured and 1 need the ancient demonic coffin to heal him. Please grant me my wish!</p><p>Lu Ming said again.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s brows furrowed even deeper as if he was deep in thought. After a moment, he said,” “Lu Ming, after the banquet, come and look for me!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It seemed that there was hope.</p><p>Then, the others made their requests.</p><p>The requests of the two sons of Chaos were naturally related to cultivation. The eternal Emperor agreed to them one by one, making everyone else envious, the battle of the ten lands will be held in less than three years. At that time, there will be great opportunities. So, during this period of time, you have to cultivate well and improve your cultivation and combat power. In the battle of the ten lands, you can seize the opportunities!</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many young men clenched their fists.</p><p>They had heard of the battle of the ten lands and were all looking forward to it.</p><p>That was a gathering of the prodigies of the entire primordial realm. How exciting would that be?</p><p>The banquet continued until the next day, when everyone left.</p><p>“Princess, I won’t be returning to the youluo devil Kingdom!”</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Luo Xuan, the Luo family’s master, and the rest.</p><p>Luo Xuan sighed in her heart. Ever since she saw Lu Ming’s strength, she knew that he would definitely not stay in the youluo demonic kingdom.</p><p>The waters of the youluo demonic kingdom were too shallow to keep a true dragon.</p><p>take care. If there’s a chance, come find me in the youluo demonic kingdom!</p><p>Luo Xuan bared his teeth, revealing a pair of tiger teeth. He was quite cute, of course, with such a beautiful princess, I’ll definitely think about you all the time. If there’s a chance, 1’11 definitely go find you!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and made a joke.</p><p>In the end, the people from the youluo devil Kingdom left. The celebration was over, and they were about to return to the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, please follow me!”</p><p>A burly middle-aged man came to Lu Ming. He was sent by the ancient Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed the middle-aged man to a side hall.</p><p>The ancient Emperor was seated at the top of the side hall.</p><p>After arriving here, the middle-aged man retreated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you really have to borrow the eternal demonic coffin?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor went straight to the point.</p><p>yes, great emperor. Without the ancient demonic coffin, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for my family to wake up!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a determined look.</p><p>The ancient Emperor pondered for a moment before saying,” “Lu Ming, if 1 still have the eternal demonic coffin, 1 can lend it to you for a month. But…” The ancient Emperor paused.</p><p>Lu Ming was taken aback. What did the ancient Emperor mean by that? could it be that the ancient demonic coffin was not in the hands of the ancient Emperor?</p><p>“To tell you the truth, the ancient demonic coffin was stolen a year ago!”</p><p>The ancient demon Emperor paused for a moment before continuing.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>The ancient demonic coffin had actually been stolen? how was this possible?</p><p>Who could steal the ancient demonic coffin from the hands of the ancient Emperor?</p><p>However, he had never thought that the ancient Emperor was lying to him. Given the ancient Emperor’s status, there was no need for him to lie to him. If he did not want to lend it to Lu Ming, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>1 didn’t bring the ancient demonic coffin with me. I hid it in a secret place in the palace. A year ago, it was stolen by someone. After that person stole the ancient demonic coffin, he escaped into the demonic sea. At that time, I was preparing to cross the heavenly Tribulation, so I didn’t chase after him!</p><p>The ancient Emperor said.</p><p>“It’s actually the demonic sea!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He had stayed in the youluo devil Kingdom for some time and had some understanding of some of the terrifying places in the land of myriad Devils. The devil sea was known as one of the three forbidden areas in the land of ten thousand Devils. It was extremely terrifying. Since ancient times, countless people had entered and countless people had died inside. It was said that even great emperors might be in danger if they entered.</p><p>However, there were also rumors that there were great opportunities in the demonic sea. If one could obtain them, they could make a major breakthrough. Entering the demonic sea was purely based on luck.</p><p>If they were lucky, they would be fine even if their cultivation was low.</p><p>However, if one was unlucky, even great emperors would be in danger after entering.</p><p>There was once a great emperor who entered and came out with serious injuries, shocking the entire land of myriad demons.</p><p>Someone had stolen the ancient demonic coffin and escaped into the demonic sea.</p><p>we can’t lose the eternal demonic coffin. We must get it back. Now that I’ve passed the Great Tribulation, I’m going to gather a group of people to enter the demonic sea and get the coffin back. If you want to borrow the coffin, you can go in with me!</p><p>“However, in the demonic sea, the situation is ever-changing. I can’t guarantee your safety ioo%!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor said.</p><p>let’s go in! Emperor, I’ll go in with you!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and agreed.</p><p>No matter what, he had to get the ancient demonic coffin and save Qiu Yue. No matter how dangerous it was, he had to try.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to be such a loyal little fellow. Alright, you can stay in the palace for now. I’ll send someone to call you when the time comes!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor said. Then, he got someone to arrange a place for Lu Ming to stay.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the palace and waited.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have to wait too long before the ancient Emperor sent someone to find him. He brought Lu Ming to a vast area.</p><p>“Demon King Cang!”</p><p>There were already many people gathered here. Lu Ming saw the Azure Demon King with a single glance.</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s gaze swept over Lu Ming, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were hundreds of people gathered here.</p><p>However, they had one thing in common, and that was that they were all very old.</p><p>There were martial emperors and Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming asked around and found out that these people were going to enter the demonic sea.</p><p>There were hundreds of Emperor-to-be and dozens of martial emperors here. Hundreds of emperors-to-be were at the end of their lifespans. They entered the demonic sea in search of opportunities to break through. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to live for long..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
