At the same time, dense runes spread out from Lu Ming’s fingers and covered the purple-robed young man at an extreme speed.</p><p>The purple-robed youth was shocked and quickly retreated, but it was too late.</p><p>He hadn’t retreated very far before his body was covered by a dense array of magical symbols. He felt as if his cultivation base had been sealed, and then he fell to the ground with a thump.</p><p>‘This</p><p>The three people at the scene were dumbfounded.</p><p>The purple-robed young man was defeated in one move.</p><p>The purple-robed youth was no ordinary person. He was extremely famous in the youluo demonic kingdom, and his reputation was even greater than Ji Peng.</p><p>Apart from the king body, the youluo demonic kingdom had ten strongest heaven’s favorites. Ji Peng was ranked ninth, while the purple-robed youth was ranked fifth.</p><p>Such a prodigy was no match for Lu Ming and was defeated in one move.</p><p>“Array Dao laws, you have a King physique!”</p><p>At this moment, the little princess, Luo Xuan, had already stood up from her seat. She looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>King physique!</p><p>The other people in the hall were all shocked.</p><p>In the entire youluo devil Kingdom, there were only a handful of people with King physiques.</p><p>This young man actually had a King body. No wonder he could defeat the purple-robed young man in one move.</p><p>Especially the burly man who was guarding the gate, he was secretly scared.</p><p>Previously, he had thought that Lu Ming was boasting shamelessly and was just finding an excuse to get close to the little princess.</p><p>Now, it seemed that they had made a big mistake. Lu Ming was really capable.</p><p>Fortunately, he had come in to inform them. Otherwise, like what Lu Ming had said, if he went to seek refuge with the eldest Princess, they would really be done for.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and the runes covering the purple-robed young man disappeared. The purple-robed young man stood up and looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>“Do you really want to join me and be my guest?”</p><p>The little princess, Luo Xuan, looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Of course. Why else would I be here?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Why do you want to join me?”</p><p>The little princess continued to ask.</p><p>little princess, you’re a famous beauty. If I don’t side with you, who should I side with?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied with a smile.</p><p>The little princess laughed in a sweet voice. She laughed so hard that her eyes squinted and said,”I like your reason!”</p><p>however, you ning is also beautiful. Why don’t you go to her? ”</p><p>The little princess continued to ask.</p><p>She looked innocent, but she was actually very meticulous.</p><p>“To tell you the truth, 1 ruthlessly beat up Ji Peng yesterday, and was just chased out by the eldest Princess.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and told her what had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear that this matter could not be hidden even if he wanted to. As long as the little princess sent someone to investigate, it would not be difficult to find out.</p><p>Oh, there’s actually such a thing. This time, you ning has misjudged you. I wonder what kind of expression she’ll have when she finds out that you have a King body during the competition. Interesting, interesting!</p><p>The little princess laughed again and continued,”There should be a condition for you to join me, right?”</p><p>I need the little princess to introduce me to the royal family of the ancient devil nation. Also, I’ll only be your guest for a few months!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, that’s easy. We’ll be heading to the eternal devil nation soon. 1 do know a few princesses and princes of the eternal devil nation. I’ll introduce them to you guys then!</p><p>The little princess agreed without hesitation. Then, she looked at the others and ordered,” “Don’t spread the news about Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two young men and the guard nodded in agreement.</p><p>all of you may leave. 1 will personally arrange a place for Lu Ming to stay!</p><p>The little princess instructed.</p><p>The two young men and the burly guard bowed and took their leave, leaving Lu Ming and the little princess alone in the hall.</p><p>you didn’t use your full strength just now, did you? you said you could help me win. I want to see how strong you are!</p><p>As soon as the little princess finished speaking, her body floated toward Lu Ming like a black cloud.</p><p>At the same time, the little princess waved her hand and a black ray of light enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Peak of an absolute Saint!”</p><p>As soon as the little princess attacked, Lu Ming could tell that her cultivation base was the same as his. They were both at the peak of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the array Dao law and pointed his finger. A true dragon roared and pounced forward. It was completely condensed by the array Dao runes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black light of the true dragon and the little princess collided with each other, creating a loud boom.</p><p>Then, countless runes spread out from the little princess ‘body.</p><p>“Judge!”</p><p>The little princess let out a soft cry, and black light burst forth, forcibly obliterating the endless symbols.</p><p>“The law of judgement!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The law of judgment was also an extremely terrifying law of the way of the king. It was known to judge everything and had astonishing offensive power. “Again!”</p><p>The little princess moved forward and fought with Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming operated the array Dao law and fought with the little princess.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his full strength as a human.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body was definitely much stronger than the little princess’. His Saint energy was also stronger than the little princess’. In the three scrolls of array Dao, Lu Ming only used the fusion of the illusionary spirit scroll and the sealed scroll. He did not add the annihilation scroll.</p><p>Even so, the little princess was still at a disadvantage after dozens of exchanges.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>After exchanging dozens of blows, the little princess retreated and said in a tender voice,” Lu Ming, you’re not weak, but Ji Tian from the Ji family also has a King body. Moreover, his cultivation has already reached the perfected absolute Saint realm. I’m afraid he’s even stronger than you!</p><p>“How would little princess know? I used all my strength just now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You didn’t use your full strength? So, you’re looking down on me!”</p><p>The little princess pouted.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. This little princess’s temper was really ever-changing. Lu Ming could not help but think of a person.</p><p>Xie nianqing!</p><p>The little princess’s temper was similar to Xie nianqing’s in the past.</p><p>“Little Qing, where are you now?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh in his heart.</p><p>Back then, the Ice Dragon patriarch had escaped with Xie nianqing. It had been a few years since then, and there had been no news of him until now. Lu Ming was very worried.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, just you wait. I’m about to break through to the perfection of the absolute Saint realm. I’ll spar with you then!</p><p>With that, the little princess bared her two canine teeth again and glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>“Let’s go. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay!”</p><p>The little princess’s expression changed very quickly. One moment, she was ‘threatening’ Lu Ming. The next moment, she was walking out of the hall with Lu Ming following closely behind.</p><p>The little princess left after arranging a courtyard for Lu Ming.</p><p>There were still 20 days before the competition between the you family and the Luo family. She wanted to reach the perfected absolute Saint realm within these 20 days.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming was very free and cultivated in peace.</p><p>As for the Ji family, they had sent people to search for Lu Ming’s traces in the entire capital, but they could not find a single clue. This made Ji Peng furious.</p><p>Just like that, twenty days passed by in a flash.</p><p>The battle for the Imperial power between the you family and the Luo family, which happened once every ioooo years, had begun!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
