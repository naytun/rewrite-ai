It’s just that some people think that hers not qualified, so I didn’t participate in the competition. That’s why I’m unknown!</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>He still needed to borrow the eternal demonic coffin from the ancient Emperor. Naturally, he had to speak up for the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“Oh, some people really have eyes but can’t see!”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed.</p><p>Gang Demon King and Gang Yau’s faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>“This Lu Ming, damn it!”</p><p>The two of them roared in their hearts. The undying Emperor said that they were blind. However, they didn’t dare to be hostile to the undying Emperor. They could only blame everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>The elder Devil looked at Lu Ming in surprise and shook his head.”You’re not my match!”</p><p>His voice was calm, but it was filled with confidence.</p><p>Even GE long, who had reached the limit of absolute Saint perfection, was not his match. How could Lu Ming be his match?</p><p>“How would you know if you didn’t fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming followed suit, also full of confidence.</p><p>The ancient devil was surprised. Lu Ming clearly knew his combat strength, but he was still so confident. Gould it be that he was really confident?</p><p>“Then let s fight!”</p><p>&Nbsp;” I’ll kill you! ancient devil spoke, his body exuding a terrifying aura as a pitch-black demonic light enveloped him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made the first move. He was still using the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>However, this time, the prison suppressing heavenly art had the support of the Laws of Ghaos and the light of chaos.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky trembled, and the space rippled like water. A terrifying power rushed toward ancient devil.</p><p>The ancient Devil’s body trembled and demonic light burst forth. He threw a punch that collided with Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A deafening boom was heard, and a terrible force swept out in all directions. Some of the force landed on the fighting ring, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A figure took three steps back, causing the air to explode.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>In this collision, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage and was forced to retreat. The ancient devil, on the other hand, did not move.</p><p>“Lu Ming is no match for them!”</p><p>Some people sighed in their hearts.</p><p>He was at a disadvantage in the first move. Lu Ming was no match for the ancient devil.</p><p>haha, he’s overestimating himself. Ancient devil, you’d better kill him and cripple him!</p><p>Gang Yau laughed in his heart, hoping that the ancient devil would go crazy and cripple Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was also a little shocked.</p><p>After his clash with the elder Devil, he had discovered that nor only was the elder Devil’s body strong, but the power of his demonic light was also shocking.</p><p>The demonic light was extremely condensed and its offensive power was unparalleled. Even Lu Ming’s chaos laws were about to be torn apart.</p><p>It was the first time that Lu Ming had encountered such a shocking power.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and circulated the prison suppressing heaven technique to its maximum, continuing to blast the ancient fiend.</p><p>The ancient devil was like a demonic god, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The two of them clashed head-on in the air, causing the sky to shake.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage. Every time they collided, he would be forced to retreat.</p><p>After exchanging a dozen moves, he had already retreated a few hundred meters.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>On the fifteenth move, Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters. He felt a sharp pain in his palm and arm.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing, is this rhe power of the immemorial demonic Dao?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was a system that was completely different from the current cultivation system. However, it was even more profound.</p><p>you’re overestimating yourself. You’re just asking to be humiliated by challenging the geniuses of the ancient demonic Dao!</p><p>Gang Yan couldn’t help but say sarcastically.</p><p>However, when he saw the cold glare of the ancient Emperor, he shuddered and almost peed his pants. His face turned pale and he didn’t dare to make another sound.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After the ancient devil pushed Lu Ming back with one move, it did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not continue to use the prison-suppressing heavenly art. Instead, he used the chaos finger of calamity.</p><p>With a point of his finger, a huge Chaos Ring formed and flew towards ancient devil.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>feNbsp; ancient Devil’s fist struck the chaos Ring, causing the chaos tribulation finger to shake and crack.</p><p>But this time, the elder Devil s attack was also blocked. His body stopped.</p><p>At this moment, countless runes appeared in Lu Ming’s left hand. With a single palm strike, the countless runes condensed into a nine Dragon that charged at the ancient devil.</p><p>“This … Was this the array Dao law? He has mastered two types of laws!”</p><p>how can this be? a Saint can actually control two laws!</p><p>Many people shouted in disbelief, and some even stood up from their seats in excitement.</p><p>It was unheard of for a Saint realm to control two laws.</p><p>“This guy… I didn’t even use much of my strength in rhe youluo devil Kingdom!”</p><p>Luo Xuan sighed.</p><p>He finally understood why Lu Ming had used the demonic lightning law in the beginning. It was an illusion formed by the chaos law.</p><p>At the side, you ning, Ji Tian, and Ji Peng naturally heard Luo Xuan’s words. They were all tongue-tied, but in the end, they all sighed.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming had not used his true abilities in the youluo demonic kingdom. He was just playing with them and probably did not rake them seriously at all.</p><p>You ning, in particular, had complicated feelings.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was her guest elder, but later on, she had personally expelled Lu Ming from the Grand princess’s residence.</p><p>She had actually expelled a son of chaos from the Grand princess’s Manor.</p><p>The undying Emperor said that Gang Demon King and Gang Yan were blind, but she was the same.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and pounced at the ancient demon. At the same time, Lu Ming pointed with his right hand and a chaos finger of tribulation was formed, blasting at the ancient demon.</p><p>The two laws attacking at the same time finally made ancient devil’s eyes turn serious.</p><p>The demonic light on his body gathered and finally turned into a demonic blade in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blade light slashed at the nine Dragons.</p><p>The terrifying power instantly tore the bodies of the nine Dragons apart.</p><p>However, after the nine Dragons were tom apart, they turned into countless runes that flew toward ancient devil, trying to seal him.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>feNbsp;” break! ancient devil roared as demonic light exploded with astonishing power, tearing apart the array Dao laws.</p><p>feNbsp; he then struck our with his blade, clashing with the primal Ghaos tribulation finger.</p><p>feNbsp; this blade had torn apart the chaos tribulation finger, but his own attack had also been rendered somewhat sluggish.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used both his hands and activated the chaos laws and array Dao laws at the same time to fight the ancient demon.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. Dozens of moves passed in the blink of an eye, but neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>The eyes of many from the ancient devil nation lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming could really fight the ancient demon. His combat strength was shocking and beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>As for rhe people from the immortal demon nation, their faces also turned unsightly.</p><p>On the other hand, the four sons of God from the two countries had extremely grave expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming, the son of chaos, was more powerful than they had imagined. He was only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm and he was already so powerful. He gave them a lot of pressure..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
