However, he was not afraid at all. He rushed towards the seal and used the chaos Divine palm. His palm turned gray and misty, containing the power of four types of laws.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on one of the seal’s claws. The seal’s body trembled and its claws were split open by Lu Ming. Blood flowed out continuously as its huge body was forced to retreat.</p><p>The seal was extremely shocked.</p><p>It was a two-star illusionary Emperor. In the sea, it had immense strength and combat strength. However, it was not Lu Ming’s match and was injured by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was not at the Martial Emperor realm yet, but he had such powerful combat strength, which shocked him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. He dashed forward and swam forward. The seal did not dare to pursue him.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to kill a few more sea beasts and gradually left the battlefield.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there was a young man following behind him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sea water churned as a few Emperor-to-be sea beasts chased after the young man.</p><p>The young man waved his hands and a few figures appeared beside him.</p><p>“A puppet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and realized that the few figures beside the young man were puppets.</p><p>They were human-shaped puppets that looked like real people, and they all carried a sword like this on their backs.</p><p>However, there was no life force on its body. Therefore, Lu Ming could tell at a glance that it was a puppet.</p><p>A few puppets rushed out and fought with the sea beasts.</p><p>The puppet’s body was fearless of death and pain. Its combat strength was amazing. It suppressed the sea beasts and killed them in a few moves.</p><p>“What a wondrous puppet art!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>That was because those puppets actually knew the art of divine power and could control the power of laws. It was truly unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Ming knew a little about the puppet technique.</p><p>When his cultivation level was still weak, he had studied puppetry in the divine wilderness continent. At that time, his puppetry skills were not low.</p><p>However, this young man’s puppetry was many times more brilliant than his.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of any power that specializes in puppeteering in the yuan mountain. Could it be that this person isn’t someone from the yuan mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea in his mind and he continued to move forward.</p><p>However, he realized that the young man was following behind him. Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>What made Lu Ming frown even more was that not long after, a few more sea beasts came after him.</p><p>To be more precise, they were not chasing Lu Ming but the young man.</p><p>The young man controlled the puppet and killed a few sea beasts before following Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and stopped. When the young man approached, he said coldly,” “This brother, why have you been following me?”</p><p>“Brother, can you do us a favor? we can leave this Sea area together!”</p><p>The young man cupped his fists and said.</p><p>The young man was dressed in a yellow robe and was quite handsome. He didn’t give off an overbearing feeling and was very polite.</p><p>“Why should I help you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a sullen face.</p><p>He didn’t know the other party, so why would he help him?</p><p>brother, to tell you the truth, I’m in the divine land, a disciple of the divine puppet sect. The divine puppet sect is named after puppets. If you help me, I can give you a rare flying puppet. Its speed is amazing, and it can reach a speed of a hundred times that of the space-breaking shuttle!</p><p>After the young man finished speaking, he waved his hand, and a puppet that looked like an eagle appeared.</p><p>“It can reach a hundred times the speed of a flying shuttle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This kind of puppet was definitely rare and very valuable. It was most suitable for transportation. To be honest, Lu Ming was a little tempted.</p><p>“The land of divine destiny, shenxi sect? To be honest, I’m very interested in your puppetry!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned and he smiled.</p><p>He was indeed very interested in the other party’s puppetry technique. The puppets he refined could actually display nomological laws. If he could master it, it would be of great help at critical moments.</p><p>“Brother, do you want to learn the art of puppetry? Sure, as long as we reach the divine fated land, you can follow me to the divine Vulture sect to learn. 1 can also pass on some secret puppet techniques to you!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Shenxiao sect’s puppetry technique is willing to be taught to outsiders?”</p><p>Lu Ming was suspicious.</p><p>brother, you might not know this, but the shenxue sect is not a sect in the traditional sense. The shenxue sect is formed by many powerhouses who are proficient in puppetry. The purpose is to attract more people who are proficient in puppetry to join!</p><p>therefore, in the shenxiao sect, everyone is encouraged to exchange the Dao of puppets and various secret techniques with each other. It is not forbidden to spread it!</p><p>The yellow-robed young man explained.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man tossed a jade talisman to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He found that there were indeed many secret skills related to puppets.</p><p>“Why didn’t you find someone else? why did you have to find me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked casually.</p><p>it’s because your combat strength is strong. You’re not even a martial Supreme, but you’ve injured a two-star illusionary divine seal with one move. This level of combat strength is really incredible. I didn’t expect that there would be a heaven’s favorite like you in the yuan mountain!</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>Previously, when he saw Lu Ming’s combat strength, he was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped.</p><p>“Then I’ll take this puppet as well!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the goshawk puppet.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man was overjoyed. Lu Ming had accepted the puppet, which meant that he had agreed to help him.</p><p>Then, the two of them walked forward. Lu Ming found out that the yellow-robed young man was called di Kai.</p><p>It was obvious that he was also a heaven’s favorite. He had a King’s body and the laws he controlled were the laws of craftsmanship.</p><p>Artifact Dao laws were also a type of King Dao laws, and they were on par with array Dao laws.</p><p>The law of craftsmanship could control all the weapons in the world and was much more superior than the law of weapons of the WAN family.</p><p>The weapon law could only control metallic weapons, but the law of craftsmanship could control any weapon.</p><p>However, not long after the two of them advanced, a few more sea beasts chased after them, and they were easily dealt with by the two of them.</p><p>However, after traveling for a while, they encountered sea beasts again. This made Lu Ming frown.</p><p>They had already left the battlefield. Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be so many sea beasts chasing after them. However, the fact was that there were sea beasts constantly chasing after them, as if they had locked onto them.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A huge sea lion roared and broke through the water with a shocking aura.</p><p>“A one-star illusionary Emperor level sea beast!”</p><p>Chi Kai’s face was a little pale.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and fought with the sea lion. In just a few moves, the one-star illusionary Emperor sea lion was split open by Lu Ming’s palm and died an unnatural death.</p><p>“Brother Lu’s combat strength is truly shocking!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming kill a one-star illusionary Emperor sea lion with just a few moves with his own eyes, di Kai’s heart was in turmoil, and he could not calm down..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
