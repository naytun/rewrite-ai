We’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>you’ve offended rhe Azure Demon King. Your fate is already decided!</p><p>The two void thearchs continued to shout coldly, provoking Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He wandered around the winding streets.</p><p>After running for a while, Lu Ming suddenly stopped and sneered,” “You want to kill me? come!11</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and charged towards the two void thearchs.</p><p>The two illusionary thearchs were stunned. They did not understand why Lu Ming had suddenly stopped running. However, Lu Ming stopping was exactly what they wanted.</p><p>“Kill!11</p><p>The two void thearchs charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, rhe armor rushed out of a building on the side and pounced on one of rhe void emperors.</p><p>The void Thearch was shocked and quickly changed the direction of his attack, bombarding the armor.</p><p>However, the armor was sturdy and immortal. It only trembled slightly before it continued to charge at rhe void Emperor. Tentacles emerged from the armor and wrapped around the other party.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, cast the chaotic finger of tribulation with all his might and charged at the other void Emperor.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, the illusionary divine did not dare to be careless. He also unleashed his full strength and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the illusionary Thearch exchanged two blows. Although he was at a disadvantage, he was blocked by the illusionary Thearch.</p><p>Lu Ming had once fought against the he family’s illusionary Emperor. However, the he family’s illusionary Emperor had just broken through to the one-star illusionary Emperor realm not long ago. His combat strength was not as strong as the person in front of him, but it was not too far off.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was no match for him, he was a threat to the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming s back glowed and the third bloodline appeared. Lu Ming had borrowed a parr of the third bloodline’s power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was very careful. He did nor dare to borrow too much and only borrowed the part that he could control.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming s abilities had increased greatly.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh…</p><p>Lu Ming continued to use the chaos finger of tribulation. After borrowing the power of his third bloodline, Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly. He could finally fight his opponent head-on and not be at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming was holding one of them back, while rhe other void Emperor was in danger.</p><p>The power of the armor had indeed increased greatly after devouring several Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>The armor was already very terrifying. It could nor even block Lu Ming’s light of chaos.</p><p>And now, the power of the armor had increased greatly. In addition ro Lu Ming’s threat, it exploded with a terrifying power.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be’s attacks kept hitting the armor, but it was useless. The armor kept getting closer and closer, and the blood-red tentacles reached out and broke the defense of the opponent.</p><p>A blood-red Tentacle wrapped itself around the void Emperor and began to devour him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The void Emperor roared in fear and struggled with all his might, but it was useless. The armor wrapped around him tighter and tighter, like an octopus. It wrapped around him tightly and began to devour him.</p><p>“Argh! Save me, quickly save me!11</p><p>The void Thearch screamed and twisted his body frantically. However, it was all in vain. He felt that everything in his body had been devoured by the armor.</p><p>His body was rapidly shriveling.</p><p>The other illusionary Thearch was shocked and wanted to save him, but he was held back by Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed middle-aged man finally arrived with his men.</p><p>However, by the time he arrived, the void Emperor, who had been bound by the armor, was already beyond saving.</p><p>His body had completely shriveled up and turned into a skeleton. His essence, Qi, and spirit had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>On the armor, a layer of bright red light spread out, as if there was blood flowing on it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The armor moved and pounced directly at the illusionary divine who was fighting Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The void Emperor launched an attack in an attempt to break through the armor and escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance to do so. He pointed his finger at the man’s chest, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood and be severely injured. The armor wrapped itself around him and its tentacles wrapped around him, starting to devour him.</p><p>“Help!11</p><p>The void Emperor cried out in horror.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s face turned pale with fear.</p><p>If even a one-star void Emperor could not put up any resistance, then he, a two-star void Emperor, would probably not be able to do so.</p><p>“Lets go!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man turned around and left without hesitation.</p><p>This ancient city was too strange. If he stayed any longer, he would probably lose his life.</p><p>The five Emperor-to-be followed the black-robed middle-aged man and rushed toward the gate of the city. They didn’t want to stay in this ancient city for a second longer.</p><p>The void Emperor, who was entangled by the armor, let out a desperate roar. Not long after, he was completely devoured by the armor and turned into a skeleton.</p><p>After devouring two void thearchs in a row, the armor emitted a piercing blood-red light. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The armor seemed to be staring at Lu Ming and was wandering around him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. The prison-suppressing stele was suspended in the air. At the same time, he grabbed the skeleton and stared at the armor.</p><p>The armor flew a few rounds. It seemed to be afraid that Lu Ming would destroy the bones. Moreover, it was also very afraid of the prison-suppressing stele. In the end, it retreated a distance away from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and chased after the black-robed middle-aged man and the rest, the armor following behind him.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming rushed to the ancient city’s Gate, he realized that the middle-aged man in the black robe and the rest had already rushed out of the city and into the demon spirit Army. They were trying to break out of the siege.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming had also rushed out of the city, but the armor remained in the city. It seemed that it could not leave the city. No matter how Lu Ming threatened it, it was useless.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in regret and could only retreat back ro the city.</p><p>Not long after, the black-robed middle-aged man broke out of the demon spirits encirclement. However, he did not go far away. Instead, he stood guard.</p><p>His expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>This time, they had really suffered heavy losses.</p><p>After entering rhe ancient city, not only had four Emperor-to-be died, but two void emperors had also died inside.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be couldn’t compare to an Emperor-to-be. An Emperor-to-be was already a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Perhaps only one out of 100 Emperor-to-be could break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>send a message to the Azure Demon King. We’ll wait here. It seems that the armor won t come out!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>Without the armor, Lu Ming did not take it to heart.</p><p>Lu Ming observed the city for a while and noticed that the black-robed middle-aged man was standing guard outside the city. He could not help but frown.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged burly man was a two-star void Emperor. Even if he borrowed the power of the third bloodline, he would not be able to break out.</p><p>let’s take a look at this ancient city and see if there are any other forces that we can borrow. Or perhaps, there are other city gates that we can use to head outside!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, then turned around and headed into the ancient city.</p><p>This ancient city was too large, vast and boundless.</p><p>With the no-fly zone, flying was not allowed, so it would take a lot of time to run.</p><p>Lu Ming explored more than ten buildings in the city but he did not find anything.</p><p>There was nothing strange about it.</p><p>This ancient city seemed to have nothing else other than the armor and the skeleton in Lu Ming s hands..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
