Don’t you dare to make a move?”</p><p>Yuanto sneered.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A delicate voice rang out, and a person stepped out. It was Luo Xuan.</p><p>what a beautiful girl. Haha, don’t worry. I’m the most tender and protective person. 1’11 show mercy later!</p><p>Yuantuo laughed.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>Luo Xuan shouted coldly. He didn’t like the other party at all.</p><p>The two of them stood facing each other, their auras spreading out.</p><p>The paragons on the fighting ring flew down and stood outside the fighting ring.</p><p>beauty, I’m ranked 25th in the immortal demon nation. May I know what’s your ranking in the eternal demon nation? ”</p><p>Yuanto said with a smile.</p><p>“22!”</p><p>Luo Xuan replied coldly.</p><p>22nd place. Haha, just in time to defeat you!</p><p>Yuan tuo laughed, and the aura on his body became stronger as he suddenly rushed toward Luo Xuan.</p><p>“Judge!”</p><p>1’11 fight you,” Luo Xuan said softly. He used the law of judgment to fight with his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the two of them were forced back. They were evenly matched.</p><p>Yuan tuo’s expression turned grave as he charged at Luo Xuan, who retaliated.</p><p>The two of them began to fight intensely.</p><p>It had to be said that Yuan tuo was very powerful. He also had a King body, not any weaker than Luo Xuan’s. The two of them exchanged dozens of moves, but neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>However, many of the people from the ancient devil nation had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>The other party had said that he was only ranked 25th in the immortal demon nation, while Luo Xuan was ranked 22nd. The two of them were equally matched. Didn’t this mean that the eternal demon nation was weaker?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the fighting ring, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves in a row, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>At this moment, yuantuo’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>He was the first to fight, and a draw was not the result he wanted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yuan tuo’s moves suddenly changed. His claws were like lightning as they aimed at Luo Xuan’s chest and other private parts.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s expression turned unsightly, and he fell into a disadvantageous position.</p><p>despicable! You actually used such a despicable method!</p><p>Someone from the ancient devil nation shouted.</p><p>what a joke. In a life-and-death battle, any means can be used. If you don’t even understand this, why are you still cultivating? ”</p><p>Someone from the immortal demon nation sneered in response, causing the faces of those from the eternal demon nation to turn ugly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Xuan was at a disadvantage, and he was finally no match for his opponent. After being struck by his opponent’s attack, his figure was sent flying back, and blood seeped out of his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yuan tuo continued to attack, and Luo Xuan was injured, so he was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>Jade-like beauty. Let me try the touch of a beauty!</p><p>Yuan tuo sneered as he approached Luo Xuan and secretly transmitted his voice to Luo Xuan.</p><p>Luo hou gritted his teeth in anger, but he was indeed no match for his opponent. After a few moves, he was sent flying again.</p><p>Luo Xuan gritted his teeth and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>She understood that she had already lost this battle. If she continued to fight, she would only be humiliated by the other party.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Yuan tuo’s figure was extremely fast. He approached Luo Xuan at an extreme speed and threw a palm at Luo Xuan.</p><p>Luo Xuan was unable to dodge this palm strike.</p><p>From his seat, Lu Ming had been paying attention to the situation in the fighting ring. At that moment, his eyes turned cold and he rushed up. From a distance, he struck out with his palm. A palm print was formed and blasted toward Yuan tuo.</p><p>It was not easy for those above the rank of a martial Supreme to fight, but he, who was from the younger generation, could.</p><p>Yuan tuo’s expression changed and he struck with all his might, clashing with Lu Ming’s palm print.</p><p>Then, his body trembled and he couldn’t help but take a few steps back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and wrapped his arms around Luo Xuan’s slender waist, returning to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Brat, you’re interfering in our battle. Are you trying to break the rules?”</p><p>Yuanto said with a gloomy face.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s body has already flown out of the fighting ring, which is equivalent to him admitting defeat. You’re the one who broke the rules first, aren’t you?” Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s body had indeed rushed out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Once he rushed out of the fighting ring, it would be equivalent to admitting defeat. Since the other party was still attacking, Lu Ming could naturally help.</p><p>“Hmph, brat, you want to be the hero saving the beauty? I’d like to see what you can do!”</p><p>A murderous intent flashed in yuantuo’s eyes. His powerful aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming let go of Luo Xuan and was about to take action.</p><p>But at this moment, a voice was heard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? What business do you have here? get down!”</p><p>Gang Yan landed on the fighting ring and glared at Lu Ming coldly.”You’re not even qualified to participate in the competition. When did you get the chance to interfere? the competition with the immortal demon nation’s heaven’s pride is naturally on us. Get down!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He sneered and said, Oh, 1’11 leave it to you then. Luo Xuan, let’s go down!</p><p>Lu Ming and Luo Xuan returned to their seats.</p><p>“Do you want to continue the battle?”</p><p>Gang Yan looked at Yuan tuo.</p><p>“What’s your ranking in the eternal devil nation?”</p><p>Asked yuanto.</p><p>“Third!” Gang Yan replied coldly and arrogantly, a faint smug look on his face.</p><p>the 3rd ranked of the eternal demon nation wants to fight against me, the 25th ranked of the immortal demon nation? ”</p><p>Yuanto said with a sneer.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll naturally send someone else to fight you!”</p><p>Gang Yan said. He used the word ‘sect’ as if everyone had to listen to his orders.</p><p>“I won one battle, so I won’t fight for now!”</p><p>Yuan tuo smiled and left the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, another young man from the immortal demon nation appeared.</p><p>1 am ao Xuan, ranked 15th in the immortal demon nation. Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Ao Xuan’s voice echoed.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A young man from the eternal devil nation stepped onto the battle platform. He was also ranked 15th in the eternal devil nation.</p><p>A huge battle had erupted. However, the result left the eternal devil nation’s people with ugly expressions.</p><p>In just a few dozen moves, the genius from the eternal devil nation was defeated.</p><p>Both of them were ranked 15th, but the geniuses of the eternal devil nation were no match for them. Didn’t this mean that the eternal devil nation wasn’t as good as the other party?</p><p>“Who else wants to fight!”</p><p>After ao Xuan won, he didn’t retreat. He wanted to continue fighting.</p><p>Following that, the genius ranked 13th from the eternal devil nation stepped forward to fight against ao Xuan.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few hundred moves, but the result was still ao Xuan’s victory.</p><p>The sparring continued, but the geniuses from the eternal devil nation were at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>The two nations had the same ranking. Even the top two of the eternal demon nation’s rankings weren’t a match for the undying demon nation’s heaven’s chosen. Only those who were ranked three or four places higher could fight or even defeat the other.</p><p>A day later, the sixth-ranked opponent had defeated the fourth-ranked opponent of the eternal devil nation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Next, another young man from the immortal demon nation went up. He was the fourth-ranked expert of the immortal demon nation.</p><p>I’ve heard that the top three of the eternal devil nation are all exceptional geniuses. Who’s in third place? come out and fight!</p><p>The person spoke.</p><p>Gang Yan stepped forward with an ugly expression.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them immediately started fighting, and an intense battle broke out.</p><p>Without a doubt, the heaven’s pride experts of the immortal demon nation had also cultivated the light of law, which made them extremely powerful. As soon as they attacked, terrifying roars sounded as if the demon gods had awakened..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
