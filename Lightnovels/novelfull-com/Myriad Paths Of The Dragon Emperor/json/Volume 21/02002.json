They burn themselves to merge with the gate to increase its power, but their original Qi is greatly damaged and they don’t have much combat power left!</p><p>and now, most of the heaven realm’s territory is under the control of the evil god tribe. Now, they have been brought into the heaven realm by the gate to the far Realm. If they are lucky and land in the territory of the human race or the demon race, it will be fine. But if they land in the territory of the evil god tribe, it will be dangerous!</p><p>After saying this, uncle Kong sighed.</p><p>They didn’t have enough people, so this was the only way. If they had a few more great emperors, they might not have to use such an extreme method.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. In other words, the fate of the two great emperors was unknown.</p><p>The two emperors were high and mighty, dominating the world. They were almost immortal and were almost invincible in the yuan mountain.</p><p>For such an existence to put himself in danger for the sake of Yuan mountain, his life and death was uncertain. It was worthy of respect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to be sad. Perhaps they will be fine!”</p><p>Emperor formless consoled Lu Ming.</p><p>“I still have to be sad when I should be!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s cold and arrogant voice rang out. He stared at Lu Ming and said, this battle was just a small interlude. The final battle will come sooner or later. We all understand this, and so do huntian and Sky Fire. They risked their lives to protect Mount Yuan, and more importantly, they wanted to protect the younger generation!</p><p>“Because your generation has reached a Golden Age where geniuses gather. You’re the hope of the future. We’ll only have hope if a real unparalleled expert can be born in your generation. So, Lu Ming, grow up well!”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely determined.</p><p>At this moment, he thought of many things.</p><p>Maybe, the three great emperors who established the yuan mountain sacred Academy and spent so much effort to gather all the heaven’s favorites in the yuan mountain to nurture them was also to allow them to grow faster.</p><p>It could be said that the three great emperors, Emperor formless, Emperor huntian, and Emperor Sky Fire, didn’t have any selfish motives. They were wholeheartedly fighting for the primordial realm and against the alien races. They didn’t even care about their own lives.</p><p>“Let’s go out. It’s time to end this battle!” He said.</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Several great emperors stepped out, and in the next moment, they were in the sky above heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The battle in heavenly Emperor City was still going on, and it was extremely tragic.</p><p>In the sky, many Martial Emperor realm experts were fighting each other. The scene was shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword light burst forth from uncle Kong’s hand. A shocking sword light cut across the sky and split it open.</p><p>Wherever the sword light passed by, the evil god tribe’s true emperors would be killed.</p><p>At the same time, Emperor notionless and the Holy Emperor also made their moves.</p><p>When a great emperor attacked, it was a complete suppression. One by one, the true emperors and void emperors of the evil god tribe were killed.</p><p>The emperor’s blood stained the sky!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of great emperors from the evil god tribe were killed.</p><p>“The great emperors have won!”</p><p>Someone from Mount Yuan shouted when he saw the great emperor make a move.</p><p>“The great emperor has won!”</p><p>The roars became stronger and stronger, and the morale of the yuan mountain people increased greatly.</p><p>As for the evil god race, their morale was greatly reduced.</p><p>They saw the great emperor of the yuan mountain land making a move, but they didn’t see the great emperor of the evil god race making a move. At this moment, they were all panicking.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>With the four great emperors taking action, the evil god race’s great emperors were all killed one by one.</p><p>With that, the great emperors of the yuan mountain were free and the battle became one-sided. Large numbers of the evil god race were killed.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Some of the evil god race members roared.</p><p>“Retreat and hide!”</p><p>Countless members of the evil god race flew in all directions. Some flew out of heavenly Emperor City, some flew directly into heavenly Emperor City, and some even sank into the ground.</p><p>“Kill, don’t let a single one off!”</p><p>The cultivators of the yuan mountain roared as they chased after the evil god race.</p><p>The four great emperors killed a few more experts from the evil god tribe before stopping.</p><p>In the previous battle, the four great emperors had been seriously injured and needed to recuperate.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, are you guys alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried.</p><p>it’s fine. I’m getting on in years. I’ll be fine after a period of recuperation!</p><p>Uncle Kong said. His eyes became cloudy again, and the aura around his body seemed to be very weak.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re going to recuperate. I’ll leave the rest to you!”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Then, the four great emperors left the place.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he sent a message to Huang Ling and the others. He found their location and met up with them to hunt down the evil god tribe members who had escaped.</p><p>This pursuit continued for a few days.</p><p>Countless members of the evil god race were killed, and their corpses covered the entire heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>However, there were still many members of the evil god race who had escaped into the wild mountains or various secret places to hide.</p><p>One could imagine that if these evil god races weren’t eliminated, sooner or later, they would turn into forces like the evil spirit religion and the demon spirit religion, who would hunt down the strong and proud children of the primordial realm.</p><p>A few days later, the great emperor sent out an order, summoning everyone to hunt down the evil god race in the yuan mountain. There would be corresponding rewards.</p><p>For a period of time, countless people formed teams and hunted around the yuan mountain. They wiped out the evil god race, and many of them were caught and killed.</p><p>Time flew by and two months passed.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the rest were flying towards a wild mountain.</p><p>Wei Xian, Are you sure? is it really in this direction? ”</p><p>Desolate li looked at a young man with a puzzled expression.</p><p>there shouldn’t be any mistake. It’s this direction!</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>The young man’s name was Wei Xian. He was a member of the Dragon Alliance of the yuan mountain sacred Institute. Two months ago, he had joined Lu Ming’s team.</p><p>Wei Xian had a strong tracking talent. He could track his enemies based on extremely weak smells and auras.</p><p>In the past two months, they had already tracked down and killed a few batches of the evil god race. Most of it was due to Wei Xian’s tracking technique.</p><p>However, this time around, they had already been tracking for three days and still had not found the evil god tribe. It was no wonder that Huang Li would be suspicious.</p><p>They continued to fly, and after a while, Wei Xian suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Why aren’t you moving?”</p><p>Everyone was puzzled.</p><p>“What a strong smell of blood!”</p><p>Wei Xian frowned.</p><p>“The smell of blood? I don’t smell it!”</p><p>Desolate’s nose twitched, but he could not smell anything.</p><p>I smell it! What a strong smell of blood! Chirp chirp!</p><p>Bubbles sat on Lu Ming’s shoulder and sniffed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. Wei Xian led the way and flew toward the place with the smell of blood.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a town.</p><p>But now, this town was lifeless and deathly silent.</p><p>Everyone was dead. Blood dyed the earth red, and the smell of blood was extremely strong.</p><p>In the town, corpses formed mountains and blood flowed like rivers.</p><p>There were at least a million people in this town, and now, all of them had been killed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
