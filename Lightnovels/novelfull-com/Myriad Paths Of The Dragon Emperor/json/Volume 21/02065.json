His body was covered in terrifying demonic fire, raising the temperature to a terrifying level.</p><p>“Cang Demon King, 1’11 send you on your way today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Then, a stone golem appeared in front of him.</p><p>When the golem first appeared, it was only as tall as a person, but it rapidly grew in size, like a small mountain.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The Azure Demon King was taken aback. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward. His body merged with the stone golem and disappeared into it.</p><p>“Demon King Cang, die!”</p><p>The stone man roared and sent a palm towards the Azure Demon King.</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s pupils contracted. He felt a sense of danger and retreated frantically.</p><p>However, the golem’s hand was even faster and caught up to Cang Demon King in an instant. The hand covered the sky and blocked all of his escape routes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the giant hand pressed down, sand and stones flew, and the pressure was powerful to the extreme.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was terrified and used all his power to control a true Emperor weapon to block the stone hand.</p><p>However, under the pressure of the giant hand, his true Emperor weapon was directly blown apart. The terrifying power slammed into the Azure Demon King’s body, causing him to scream in pain as his body was sent flying. He crashed into the mountain, causing the entire mountain to shake.</p><p>The mountain had been eroded by demonic Qi all year round and had long since been sturdy and immortal, but it was still smashed apart by the Azure Demon King, leaving a huge crater.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>The Azure Demon King howled in his heart. He couldn’t believe how the golem could be so powerful.</p><p>He was a peak true Emperor, but he couldn’t even resist this stone being. He was truly terrified.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming had such powerful golems, why did he not use them in the ancient city? At that time, Lu Ming almost died in his hands, but he did not even use the golems.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had obtained the golems in the ancient city? The golems he got from the lava?</p><p>At this thought, the Azure Demon King almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>If that was the case, he would be helping Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone golem landed heavily in front of the Azure Demon King. The latter was shocked and wanted to use a secret technique to escape, but the stone golem stomped down, stomping him under its foot.</p><p>The Azure Demon King let out a blood-curdling screech. He was like a lazy toad that had been stomped on, almost bursting into pieces.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, Lu Ming! Let me go! I’m an important official of the eternal devil nation! If you kill me, you’ll be offending the entire eternal devil nation!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King was terrified. He wanted to use the eternal demon nation to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>don’t use the eternal devil nation to threaten me. You’re just a peak true Emperor. You can’t represent the eternal devil nation. Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything more. He wielded the stone sword and slashed at the ashen Demon King.</p><p>The Azure Demon King howled madly. He was almost scared out of his wits as he struggled with all his might. However, it was useless. As the Battle Sword slashed down, the Azure Demon King’s Head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>His soul was destroyed!</p><p>After killing the ashen Demon King, Lu Ming kept the ashen Demon King’s storage ring. Then, he took a step forward and rushed to the top of the mountain.</p><p>There were people in black robes who tried to stop him, but they were killed by his sword.</p><p>With the energy stored in the stone golems, they could simply abuse the Thearch of the he family. No one below the Thearch level could stop Lu Ming. Anyone who dared to stop Lu Ming would be killed in seconds.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming had rushed to the top of the mountain.</p><p>At this moment, most of the black-robed men were drawn away to fight the eternal devil nation.</p><p>Only a black-robed man was still sitting cross-legged beside the huge demonic coffin.</p><p>“The ancient demonic coffin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion. As long as he could get the eternal demonic coffin, he could save Qiu Yue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a large hand and grabbed at the ancient demonic coffin.</p><p>However, at this moment, the black-robed figure sitting in front of the coffin suddenly opened his eyes. Two rays of light shot out from his eyes like two terrifying divine swords that could pierce through everything.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two beams of light struck Lu Ming’s large hand, producing the sound of metal clashing. A terrifying force blocked the large hand from moving forward.</p><p>At the same time, the black-robed man dashed forward, his body emitting a terrifying demonic light. He waved his hands and two pitch-black palm prints shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm print was like an avalanche, its power shocking.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>There was actually a great emperor here.</p><p>There were two great emperors among the black-robed men.</p><p>One of them was fighting against the ancient Emperor while the other was guarding this place.</p><p>Under the demonic sea, there was a group of terrifying black-robed people. Among them, there were actually two great emperors keeping watch. This was truly shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and the stone golems ‘house-like fists blasted towards the black-robed man.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were two consecutive deafening rumbles. Lu Ming had blocked two of the opponent’s palm prints.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>With a single thought, the stone sword flew out and slashed down violently.</p><p>The other party’s body trembled, and demonic light filled the sky. At the same time, the other party controlled the power of the great Dao, turning it into a demonic weapon and attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>There was another huge tremor and the stone sword buzzed. It was sent flying back and landed in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Lu Ming held the stone sword in his hand and continuously slashed at his opponent. He launched a storm-like attack, completely disregarding his own injuries.</p><p>The other party had transformed great DAOs into weapons, and their offensive power was astonishing. However, when they landed on Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, they couldn’t break through the defense of Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body at all.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor had reached the heavenly Emperor realm through his stone golems. His body’s defense was stronger than an ordinary heavenly Emperor’s, and ordinary great emperors couldn’t break through it at all.</p><p>Lu Ming went all out and ignored his defense. His combat strength increased greatly. The other party was forced to retreat by Lu Ming and was at a disadvantage for a while.</p><p>After more than ten moves, the black-robed Emperor was sent flying by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and appeared in front of the demonic coffin.</p><p>He stretched out his claws, wanting to grab the demonic coffin.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming was suddenly stunned.</p><p>The ancient demonic coffin didn’t have a lid. Therefore, one could clearly see what was going on inside the coffin from this position.</p><p>Inside the demonic coffin, there was actually a person, a woman, who was peerlessly beautiful.</p><p>Xie nianqing!</p><p>The woman in the coffin was Xie nianqing!</p><p>Lu Ming was completely stunned when he saw Xie nianqing.</p><p>Why would Xie nianqing be here?</p><p>Back then, the Ice Dragon patriarch had taken Xie nianqing and the cloud Dragon Valley master had taken Lu Ming. They had broken out of the encirclement from different directions. Since then, he had lost contact with Xie nianqing and had never seen him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, several years had passed!</p><p>However, he never expected that Xie nianqing would appear here. This was the demon sea, one of the forbidden areas in the land of ten thousand demons. Moreover, Xie nianqing was still lying in the demon coffin.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long sigh of relief when he scanned Xie nianqing with his spiritual senses. His vital signs were normal and there were no problems.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s eyes were closed as he lay in the coffin. It was as if he couldn’t sense anything outside.</p><p>“Put it away first!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not care so much. He would keep it first.</p><p>While Lu Ming was still in a daze, the black-robed Emperor launched a few attacks at Lu Ming, forcing him to retreat..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
