All things in the world had fate. This law was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos existed even before the heavens and earth were created.</p><p>Everything in the world was born from chaos.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos were known as the Emperor of laws. It was not just for show.</p><p>Therefore, when many people heard that there was a son of chaos in Yuan mountain, they found it hard to believe.</p><p>“We’re telling the truth!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao and the rest said. Although Wei Tiandao had a grudge against Lu Ming, he had to mention Lu Ming at this time or he would be looked down upon.</p><p>The others were bewildered. Could it be that the son of chaos had really been born in Yuan mountain? then the battle of the ten lands this time would probably be even more intense.</p><p>That was because there was also a son of chaos in the divine land. He was unimaginably powerful and had almost defeated all the enemies in the divine land.</p><p>There were so many paragons in the divine land, but only a few were a match for the son of chaos. Even some of the other sons of heaven had lost to him.</p><p>If there really was a son of chaos in Yuan mountain, who would be stronger if the two of them were to fight?</p><p>As everyone discussed, Lu Ming smiled and was not too bothered.</p><p>Brother Lu, aren’t you going up to occupy one of the Emperor-gazing pillars? ”</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>He was very clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength. It was terrifying and shocking. He was definitely a Son of God, an extremely terrifying one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes also revealed his desire.</p><p>Didn’t he come to the divine land to fight against these top heaven’s favorites and improve himself?</p><p>In the yuan mountain, he had almost no opponents.</p><p>Ever since the battle at the lotus flower world in the star River, he had not appeared. Now that so many Children of Heaven had appeared, Lu Ming’s body also exuded a trace of fighting spirit.</p><p>“Qiuyue, wait for me here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>young master, go! All the best!</p><p>Qiu Yue waved her little fist.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and his figure soared into the sky. Then, he flew towards one of the gazing Emperor pillars and landed on one of them.</p><p>Many people could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The paragons of Yuan mountain were shocked when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>In the yuan mountain, Lu Ming’s reputation had already reached its peak.</p><p>Not only had he defeated the star River, but he had also controlled the heavenly Emperor’s body and killed several martial sovereigns in succession. In the end, he had even abused the great emperor of the he clan. Such a battle record was truly like a magnitude 12 earthquake.</p><p>he is the son of chaos in my Yuan mountain!</p><p>A heaven’s chosen from the yuan mountain spoke.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the son of chaos in Yuan mountain?</p><p>Was he the real son of chaos?</p><p>Even the sons of God on the gazing Emperor pillar looked at Lu Ming. Some of them were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Son of chaos? I’d like to see how strong your combat power is!”</p><p>Sure enough, someone moved. It was a gray-robed young man with a burly figure.</p><p>Previously, someone had recognized that this person came from the land of heavenly barbarian, one of the ten lands of the yuan continent. He was a son of primordial chaos who controlled the primordial chaos laws.</p><p>Primordial chaos laws and chaos laws were the most similar among the ten ultimate laws.</p><p>The chaos had yet to open, and the primordial chaos had yet to be judged!</p><p>However, the world had always placed chaos laws above primordial chaos laws.</p><p>Now that the son of primordial chaos saw Lu Ming, he naturally revealed his fighting spirit.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This person was called Huang Meng. At this moment, a powerful aura burst out from him as he stepped on the air and flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Absolute Saint in the great circle!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Huang Meng’s cultivation was at the peak of the perfected absolute Saint realm. He was only one step away from the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Huang Meng took action very directly. He was like a primordial beast, his entire body suffused with primordial chaos laws.</p><p>Primordial chaos laws were like chaos laws, as heavy as mountains.</p><p>Huang Meng threw a punch, and a terrifying fist force headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the chaos Divine palm. His palm was like a chaos stone and he slapped it at Huang Meng.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The sky shook like a huge drum, and a shocking boom erupted.</p><p>Then, a figure retreated continuously, the void trembled under his feet.</p><p>It was Huang Meng! The one who retreated was Huang Meng.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was standing on the gazing Emperor pillar, motionless.</p><p>it’s the law of chaos! It’s really the law of chaos!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Before he made a move, some people still did not believe it. Now that he made a move, they finally saw that Lu Ming was really using the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>A son of chaos had really appeared in Yuan mountain!</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>die! Huang Meng shouted. A layer of nomological light emanated from his body as he charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>He punched out continuously. Each punch was as heavy as a mountain, and each punch could blow up a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming still activated the chaos Divine palm and met the attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there were constant explosions. The force from the two’s fight turned into a Gale that swept in all directions, causing those who were close to it to retreat.</p><p>After more than ten consecutive explosions, Huang Meng’s body was forced back. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with intense shock.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s chaos laws did not form a River. This meant that Lu Ming was not in the Emperor-to-be realm but in the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>In a battle at the same level, he was actually suppressed. This made him a little discouraged.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Just now, he had not used any other laws, only the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>Although his chaos laws were only at 99% maturity, comparable to the other party’s primordial chaos laws, he was still in a state of shock.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s physical body was already stronger than the average child of God. Furthermore, Lu Ming’s array Dao laws had already formed a River. After tempering his physical body once, his physical body had become even stronger.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s Saint energy was stronger than the average person’s. Therefore, even if Lu Ming only used the law of chaos, no one would be his match in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Naturally, he could crush Huang Meng.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He was only at the same level as Huang Meng, but he could crush Huang Meng!</p><p>They were both children of God, so how could this be?</p><p>Could the Laws of Chaos really be that powerful?</p><p>However, there were also Sons of Chaos in the land of divine destiny. Although their combat strength was strong, they could not crush the sons of heaven of the same level.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>“You’re very strong. I’m not your match!”</p><p>Huang Meng shook his head and returned to the Emperor gazing pillar.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>After Huang Meng retreated, another person stepped forward, and a powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Imperial River, the child of Samsara!</p><p>Many people revealed excited expressions. Yuhe was about to make his move.</p><p>Yuhe had already entered the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>The combat strength of a Son of Heaven at the Emperor-to-be realm was absolutely shocking. He was going to fight Lu Ming. Would Lu Ming be a match for him?</p><p>“A battle in the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very straightforward. With that, he soared into the sky..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
