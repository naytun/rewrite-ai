Lu Ming was very familiar with the devouring power.</p><p>Comprehending the law of devouring was definitely faster than comprehending other laws.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had a kind of ambition. Since he wanted to understand the laws, he had to understand the king path laws and above. It would be a waste of time to understand the ordinary laws.</p><p>After all, ordinary laws and chaos laws could be changed directly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his physical body, and a Dragon’s Roar came from within. At the same time, a terrifying devouring power burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and tried to comprehend the law of devouring from the devouring power.</p><p>Indeed, a few days later, Lu Ming found the way and had some insights.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming had successfully learned the rudiments and had comprehended a trace of the law of devouring.</p><p>His Saint heart had indeed contained many laws, and it was not affected at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely excited.</p><p>All of these were things that could only be done by those above the Martial Emperor realm. However, he was doing it now. Once he broke through to the Martial Emperor realm in the future, his cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds. There would be no shackles, and his improvement would be extremely shocking.</p><p>It was worth it to spend time comprehending it now.</p><p>young master, you’re really amazing. You’ve already mastered four types of nomological laws!</p><p>Qiu Yue walked over. Even though she had always admired Lu Ming, she could not help but look surprised.</p><p>It was unheard of for a person below the rank of a martial Supreme to control four types of nomological laws at the same time, and two of them were even ultimate nomological laws.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded, and the two of them walked forward.</p><p>The six middle-aged men appeared at the same time and attacked Lu Ming and his partner.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. The Laws of Chaos, the laws of death, and the laws of array Dao fused together. Lu Ming cast the chaos finger of calamity, pointing five times in a row.</p><p>Qiu Yue charged at the sixth middle-aged man.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The dazzling Saber Light was aimed at Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue successfully blocked one of them.</p><p>&Nbsp; five saber lights struck the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With five consecutive explosions, the blade light shattered and the five middle-aged men were forced back.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and unleashed his full combat strength, launching a storm of attacks at the five middle-aged men.</p><p>The breakthrough in the array Dao laws had increased Lu Ming’s combat strength by a large margin. He was completely suppressing the five middle-aged men.</p><p>After a dozen or so moves, a finger force pierced through the middle of a middle-aged man’s eyebrows, killing him and turning him into energy.</p><p>After killing one of them, the remaining four were even less of a match for Lu Ming. After a few moves, Lu Ming killed another one.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, the remaining middle-aged men were all killed by Lu Ming, including the middle-aged man who was fighting with Qiu Yue.</p><p>After passing this level, the two of them continued forward and passed through this area.</p><p>There was nothing in front of him, no one.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed slightly. He knew that Xie nianqing had probably already passed the checkpoint and left this place.</p><p>“Qiuyue, wait here. I’ll go up and test the waters!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>en, alright. Be careful, young master!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped forward. After walking for a while, another figure appeared.</p><p>This time, only one figure appeared. It wasn’t a middle-aged man, but a young man. This person looked to be in his twenties. His body was straight like a spear and he had a black demonic sword on his back.</p><p>only the strongest can pass. Show me your strength!</p><p>The young man said coldly as he unsheathed his sword.</p><p>Lu Ming also stepped forward and used the finger of chaotic tribulation to fight with his opponent.</p><p>This young man’s combat strength was shocking. He should be in the Emperor-to-be realm, but he was probably even stronger than the Son of God.</p><p>However, they were still not as strong as the previous five middle-aged men. Between three middle-aged men and five middle-aged men, they were still not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>After more than twenty moves, the young man was defeated by Lu Ming. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue moved forward and passed through the area.</p><p>However, the canyon seemed to be very long. Looking forward, it was extremely deep.</p><p>After passing through this area, Lu Ming continued to move forward alone.</p><p>This time, two young men appeared at once.</p><p>The two young men’s combat strength increased exponentially when they joined forces. Although Lu Ming gave it his all, they ended up in a draw and he did not manage to clear the trial.</p><p>“It seems that it’s really difficult to break out!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. At the same time, he was also shocked. The difficulty of this demonic force in the heaven realm’s test of its disciples was simply abnormal.</p><p>Even the Son of God would not be able to pass this level of difficulty.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength had definitely surpassed a Son of God who was at the Emperor-to-be realm. However, he still could not make it.</p><p>my attacks are still limited. My strongest attack is the chaos finger, but it’s more suitable for long-range attacks. It’s not as good for close combat. 1 need to learn one or two more divine abilities!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The chaotic Scripture contained many techniques regarding the chaotic laws. Naturally, the chaotic tribulation finger was not the only technique.</p><p>&Nbsp; but in the past, cultivating the primal Chaos tribulation finger was enough.</p><p>[ divine power techniques and nomological laws complement each other. Comprehending a divine power Technique and continuously cultivating it can increase one’s comprehension of nomological laws and increase one’s mastery.</p><p>]</p><p>Therefore, it might not be beneficial to comprehend a few more magical powers. Instead, it might distract him.</p><p>However, it was different now. Lu Ming had almost comprehended the chaos laws to the limit. There would be no obstacles in cultivating other magical powers. He would be able to cultivate to the peak in a short time.</p><p>In the chaos Scripture, Lu Ming chose to cultivate a remarkable power Technique called the chaos Divine palm.</p><p>After successfully cultivating the chaos Divine palm, one’s palm would be like chaos. Every palm strike was like a Chaos Divine mountain pressing down. It was so powerful that it could penetrate the earth and blow up mountains.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s law of chaos was almost at ninety-nine percent. His speed of cultivating the chaos Divine palm was like a rocket. In just a few days, he had cultivated to the limit.</p><p>Its power was not the slightest bit inferior to the primal Chaos tribulation finger, especially when it was fused with several laws. Its power was even more astonishing.</p><p>With one more attack method, Lu Ming put aside the divine power art for the time being and focused on comprehending a few laws.</p><p>Qiu Yue was also cultivating hard.</p><p>After becoming an Emperor-to-be, one needed to accumulate and then completely integrate the Dharma into the Saint heart. With the Dharma as the foundation and the Saint heart as the material, the world would be developed.</p><p>This step was extremely difficult. Many people were stuck in the Emperor-to-be realm for their entire lives.</p><p>It wasn’t something that could be completed in a day.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>Other than cultivating, Lu Ming would be challenging the levels.</p><p>Both of them had gained a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in the canyon for more than two years.</p><p>It had been more than two and a half years since Lu Ming came to the land of infinite demons. It was less than half a year before the ten lands battle.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally arrived at the last stage of the canyon.</p><p>The exit of the canyon could be seen in front of them. It was a door of light..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
