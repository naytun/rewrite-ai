Kill! Kill!</p><p>Battle cries shook the heavens and shot straight into the clouds.</p><p>Lu Ming climbed up a dead-silent mountain peak and stood at the peak. He looked ahead and his pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p>There was a huge ancient city in front of them. This ancient city was different from the ones they had encountered before.</p><p>The ancient cities they had encountered before had almost all collapsed, but this one was intact. It was extremely majestic and huge. From a distance, it looked like a prehistoric giant beast lying there.</p><p>Outside the ancient city, there was a black mass of figures. These figures were wearing iron armors and holding all kinds of combat weapons.</p><p>“These aren’t living beings!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the figures carefully. They were pitch-black and the bodies under the armor seemed to be formed by energy. They were not living creatures.</p><p>“Mo Ling!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. This should be a demonic spirit formed from the undying demonic will of a demonic path elite who died in battle.</p><p>There were at least tens of thousands of demonic spirits. When they gathered together, they would occasionally let out battle cries that shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>However, Mo Ling had been wandering outside the ancient city. He didn’t leave or enter the ancient city.</p><p>this ancient city is intact. I’m afraid there’s an opportunity!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, but he did not plan to go in and explore.</p><p>Not to mention whether there was any danger in the ancient city, just the demon spirits alone were not easy to deal with.</p><p>After observing for a while, Lu Ming shook his head. He moved and left the place.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not fly far before he saw a few streaks of light. A few elders appeared not far away.</p><p>These were the quasi-emperors from the eternal devil nation. Clearly, they had been drawn over by the battle cries.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be also saw Lu Ming. They smiled and flew toward him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s in front? Why is there such a fierce battle cry? it’s as if there are thousands of soldiers and horses!”</p><p>An old man asked. He had a gentle smile on his face and a kind expression.</p><p>an ancient city. There are at least tens of thousands of demonic spirits outside the ancient city. The battle cries are from the demonic spirits!</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>an ancient city!</p><p>The old men’s eyes lit up.</p><p>They had come here in search of opportunities because their lifespans were about to run out. If they could not break through, they would die sooner or later.</p><p>After cultivating for more than 100000 years, they were finally reduced to dust. They were unwilling and wanted to give it a try. When they heard that there was an ancient city, they were naturally moved.</p><p>They speculated that it was very likely that the demonic sea had fallen from the heavenly realm and formed. It definitely contained opportunities.</p><p>“Lu Ming, aren’t you going to explore the ancient city?”</p><p>The kind-looking old man asked.</p><p>“I’m not going!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. His main goal in entering the demonic sea was the eternal demonic coffin. He was not too interested in the opportunities.</p><p>“Let’s go in then!”</p><p>The kind-looking old man smiled. There were four of them in total. They flew in the direction of the ancient city and passed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Just as the two sides crossed each other, a sword light suddenly bloomed from the hands of the kind-looking old man, slashing toward Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>The sword light cut through the air with a terrifying whistling sound. It was extremely sharp.</p><p>At the same time, the other three Emperor-to-be also made their move. All kinds of terrifying attacks were aimed at Lu Ming’s vital parts.</p><p>However, when the four attacks landed on Lu Ming, the chaotic light burst out from his body and blocked all their attacks. The chaotic light shook and a powerful force surged out. The four Emperor-to-be’s bodies trembled and they retreated.</p><p>“You guys are really looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his cold gaze sweeping across the four of them.</p><p>“You’ve been on guard against us?”</p><p>The kind-looking old man said with an ugly expression.</p><p>At such a close distance, they had launched an attack at an astonishing speed. If Lu Ming had not been on guard against them, he would not have been able to react in such a short time and defend himself and counterattack.</p><p>The only explanation was that Lu Ming had been on guard against them and had long prepared his defense.</p><p>that old fellow, the Azure Devil King, has been showing killing intent towards me from time to time along the way. I’ve also heard that he’s extremely powerful in the eternal devil nation. If he wants to order some people around, there will be many who are willing to become his lackeys. Naturally, I have to be on guard!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>It could be said that other than the ancient Emperor, Lu Ming was wary of everyone else who entered the demonic sea.</p><p>The old man, Cang Demon King, had lost face because of Lu Ming last time. It was obvious that he held a grudge against him and had always wanted to kill him. With the power of Cang Demon King, it was normal for him to bribe some people to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The kind-looking old man roared, turned around, and ran.</p><p>They were all too clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength. He was not someone they could fight against. Since their sneak attack had failed, they could only run.</p><p>“Do you think you can escape? Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to chase after the kind-looking old man. His speed was shocking. He caught up with the kind-looking old man in a few breaths.</p><p>The kind-looking old man was almost scared to death. He shouted,” “Lu Ming, you can’t kill me! This is the eternal devil nation! If you kill me, you’ll die too!” you’re still threatening me at this time. What a joke. Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He pointed his finger and a finger force that had been condensed to the extreme burst out.</p><p>Although the kind-looking old man tried his best to block it, it was completely useless. The finger force directly pierced through the space between his eyebrows, and even his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the other party, he did not stop and chased after the other three.</p><p>“Split up and run!”</p><p>One of them shouted, and the three of them fled in three different directions.</p><p>However, Lu Ming caught up to another person and killed him in a few moves.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming went after the third person.</p><p>“Don’t, spare me…”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was extremely cold. He had to kill these people.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar was heard. In the distance, a terrifying demonic light slashed at Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the demonic light was already about to cut Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and a sense of danger rose in his heart. At this moment, he burst out with all his strength.</p><p>The light of chaos surrounded his body as he controlled two types of nomological laws and used his strongest move, destruction. Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; a gray finger of tribulation pointed at the demonic light, erupting with a deafening boom.</p><p>The demonic light buzzed and was eventually blocked by Lu Ming. However, the chaos finger of tribulation was also cut apart by the demonic light.</p><p>Lu Ming felt an extremely powerful force surging towards him. His body could not help but retreat a few thousand meters. He felt the qi and blood in his body churning.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>It was definitely a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In front of him, a black-robed middle-aged man appeared.</p><p>This person exuded a terrifying aura. It was the emperor’s might.</p><p>“This person is definitely not a one-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He had fought with a one-star void Emperor before, but he was definitely not as strong as this middle-aged man..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
