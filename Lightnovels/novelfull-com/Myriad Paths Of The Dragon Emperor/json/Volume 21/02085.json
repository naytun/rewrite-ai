The cold aura spread in all directions, startling many people who were cultivating.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s Muyang and Lu Ming!”</p><p>Many people were shocked and angry at first, but when they saw that it was Mu yang and Lu Ming, they kept quiet.</p><p>They could tell that there was a conflict between the two peerless geniuses and they were probably going to fight.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Mu yang made his move. His palm was covered with a layer of light. It was so terrifying that it seemed like the space around him had turned into nothingness. It made the area around his palm look like a black hole.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming went up to him and cast the chaos Divine palm. His palm turned gray like a chaos stone.</p><p>The two palms collided heavily, and the sound was like a loud Bell. The terrifying force formed circles of shock waves that swept in all directions.</p><p>Many of them emitted light to resist the shockwave.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu Yang’s bodies trembled and they exchanged a few more moves. However, there was no clear winner.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that Muyang’s power was like a storm, pressing down on him. Coupled with the void law, it almost broke through his chaos law and turned him into nothingness.</p><p>This Mu yang was definitely stronger than otaku mi he.</p><p>you do have some strength. No wonder you’re so arrogant. But this bit of strength is not enough!</p><p>In Mu Yang’s eyes, a strange light bloomed. It was the light of nothingness. The aura on his body grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>However, at this moment, an extremely terrifying aura exploded in the sky.</p><p>The terrifying pressure was like an ancient divine mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming and Mu yang, causing their bodies to freeze.</p><p>A white-haired old man had appeared in the sky.</p><p>The old man looked down at Lu Ming and Muyang and said coldly, don’t be impudent in front of the celestial Emperor’s statue. Don’t fight. Anyone who violates this will be killed. Since this is your first offense, I’ll spare you this time. If you want to fight, fight somewhere else!</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu yang retracted their auras, but their cold gazes were still fixed on each other.</p><p>“Do you dare to fight me on the battle platform?”</p><p>Mu yang said coldly. He was very confident in himself.</p><p>Although the combat strength that Lu Ming had displayed earlier was very shocking, he was confident that he could defeat Lu Ming because he had not used his full strength.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“Senior, let us leave!”</p><p>Mu yang said to the old man in the sky.</p><p>The old man retracted his aura and the pressure on Lu Ming and the rest disappeared.</p><p>“If you have the guts, come!”</p><p>Mu yang left these words before stepping into the air and leaving.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and followed him. Qiu Yue, bi Kai, and the rest quickly followed.</p><p>“The son of chaos is going to fight against Muyang. Let’s go and see!”</p><p>1 heard that Muyang has already reached the Emperor-to-be realm and is about to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. He’s extremely powerful. Lu Ming hasn’t even reached the Emperor-to-be realm, but he’s brave enough to accept the challenge? ”</p><p>the sons of God are all proud and arrogant. How can they not fight when others challenge them? however, I think Lu Ming will most likely lose this time. After all, he only has a cultivation base of a perfected absolute Saint!</p><p>1 think so too. No matter how strong a perfected absolute Saint is, there’s still a limit!</p><p>Lu Ming could hear the voices around him.</p><p>He speculated that Muyang had already started to develop a small world. A person like him could already attempt to become a martial Supreme.</p><p>Not long after, they came to a vast area. There was a huge battle platform here.</p><p>At this moment, there were two people still fighting on the fighting ring.</p><p>They were two young men, both with King physique and strong battle strength.</p><p>However, Mu yang was extremely domineering. He flew up into the air and stomped down, get off the stage! he shouted.</p><p>The terrifying void light made the two young men’s expressions change drastically. They kept stepping back and landed on the edge of the fighting stage, looking at Mu yang with an ugly expression.</p><p>They were in the middle of a battle, and Muyang had come to tell them to get out. This was an insult to them.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Still not scramming, do you want to fight me?”</p><p>Mu yang looked at the two King physiques, his voice filled with dissatisfaction.</p><p>The two King physiques didn’t dare to fight with Mu yang. In the end, they could only swallow their anger and jump off the fighting stage.</p><p>Around them, many people were dissatisfied. Muyang was too overbearing.</p><p>However, no one stood out to criticize him. Not only was Mu yang powerful, but the force behind him was also extremely terrifying. No one would be willing to offend him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get down here and fight!”</p><p>Mu Yang’s voice spread in all directions.</p><p>“You don’t have to shout so loudly, I won’t run!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said indifferently. He stepped into the air and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I advise you to hand over the chaos Scripture obediently. I can let you off this time and let you participate in the battle of the ten lands. Otherwise, you won’t even be able to participate in the battle of the ten lands!”</p><p>Mu yang said coldly. Of course, he was only sending a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I said, if you want it, let’s see if you have the ability!” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>you’re so stubborn. Then I’ll let you see what it means to be stronger than you!</p><p>Mu Yang’s eyes were cold, and his body was filled with killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He took a step forward and charged towards Lu Ming. His entire body was shrouded in the light of nothingness as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the chaos laws and went up to them.</p><p>This time, it was not under the statue of the celestial Emperor, but on the battle stage. There was no need to restrain themselves, and the two of them fought with all their might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously, causing the fighting ring to rumble and explode.</p><p>The two of them fought with speed, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>The fighting ring was surrounded by people.</p><p>Many of them were terrifying geniuses, and many of them were children of the heavens.</p><p>“Lu Ming is no match for Muyang!”</p><p>Imperial River said.</p><p>Previously, he had a huge battle with Lu Ming and he was clear of Lu Ming’s abilities.</p><p>Amitabha. That might not be the case. I think that benefactor Lu Ming can win!</p><p>Wuchen monk of boundless temple chanted the name of Buddha and smiled.</p><p>These words moved everyone.</p><p>Monk Wu Chen had mastered the law of karma. Everything in the world had a cause and effect. Perhaps he could see something through the cause and effect.</p><p>“You’re saying that Lu Ming hid his strength when he fought me?”</p><p>Yuhe’s eyes lit up in disbelief.</p><p>“I can’t say, I can’t say. We’ll know when we continue watching!”</p><p>Elder monk Wu Chen said with a mysterious smile.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had already exchanged dozens of moves with Mu yang.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>“As expected, it has already started to evolve into a small world!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Muyang had already started to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. He had started to use the laws as a Foundation to develop a small world. There was a trace of the power of a small world in his Saint energy, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had only cast one type of chaos law and was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve said it before. You’re not my match!”</p><p>Mu yang launched a storm of attacks. At the same time, his cold and arrogant voice entered Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“It’s too early for you to be happy!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>Since one law didn’t work, then he would use two..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
