It left a deep sword mark on the ground and the short peak was cut in half.</p><p>“Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. The person who had attacked just now was definitely a Martial Emperor. However, he should only have the cultivation of a one-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, sword radiances flashed above and below Lu Ming. The two sword radiances, one above and one below, shot toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Saint energy in Lu Ming’s body circulated crazily as he retreated rapidly, avoiding the two sword gleams.</p><p>Martial Emperor, they were all martial emperors!</p><p>A few people appeared behind him. They were also martial Supreme powerhouses.</p><p>“Your reaction is quite fast!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. A few black-robed men appeared in the sky and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who are you people?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>the Grim Reaper wants you to die today. He won’t let you live until tomorrow!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly.</p><p>“It’s the death god nation!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>There were also people cultivating in this area. When they heard this, they were so frightened that they screamed and ran for their lives.</p><p>“The death god nation!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had just arrived at the divine land and had not heard of it.</p><p>don’t talk nonsense. End the battle quickly!</p><p>A black-robed man coldly spoke.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black-robed men moved at an astonishing speed.</p><p>A few sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming at a terrifying speed.</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming no longer hid his strength. He unleashed his full power and charged at one of the black-robed men.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He struck out with his palm. His palm was gray and misty, like an ancient divine mountain pressing down, and it directly shattered the sword light of the black Sect’s man. The terrifying palm force bombarded the black-robed man’s body, and directly shattered him into pieces.</p><p>A one-star Martial Emperor was instantly killed by Lu Ming. The scene shocked the other black-robed men to their cores.</p><p>no, his combat strength is wrong. It’s not consistent with the information we got!</p><p>One of the black-robed men shouted.</p><p>They had received news that Lu Ming’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than Muyang’s.</p><p>As the son of void, Muyang had already begun to evolve his world. His combat strength was enough to compete with or even suppress a one-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>He was slightly stronger than Muyang, but his combat strength should not be that much stronger. It was absolutely impossible for him to kill a one-star Martial Emperor with one move.</p><p>“Attack, attack together!”</p><p>One of the black Sect members shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, in the sky, there were seven to eight figures.</p><p>In addition to the few from before, there were more than a dozen.</p><p>Terrifying auras filled the air. They were all experts above the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>“No matter how strong he is, he must die today. Kill!”</p><p>One of the men in Black robes shouted and slammed his palm down. A palm print as black as ink shot toward Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>a three-star Martial Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. A three-star Martial Emperor was too powerful. Lu Ming did not dare to take the attack head-on, so he rushed out directly.</p><p>“You want to leave? go back!”</p><p>A black-robed man appeared in front of him. He held a pitch-black saber and slashed at Lu Ming. A vast saber radiance was slashed at him.</p><p>He was also a three-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>At such a close distance, it was impossible to Dodge. He could only take it head-on.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and the four types of laws burst out at the same time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a palm at the saber radiance, causing a deafening boom.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as he was sent flying. The terrifying force caused Lu Ming to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>A three-star Martial Emperor was too powerful. Lu Ming was still not a match for him.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>After Lu Ming was sent flying, the other black-robed men charged at him again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. Death Qi burst out from his eyes. One of the black-robed men was enveloped by the death Qi and was shocked.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward and directly sent the person flying. In the process of retreating, the person’s body cracked and split into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was fully unleashed. It was difficult for a one-star illusionary Emperor to block a single move from Lu Ming.</p><p>the law of death and the law of chaos. My God, how is this possible?”</p><p>two ultimate maxims. Monster, monster. Kill him. We must kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with all his might. Two ultimate maxims were operating at the same time. It could not be hidden at all and would be revealed.</p><p>When the black-robed men saw that Lu Ming had mastered two ultimate maxims, they were shocked beyond words. Some of them shouted in shock.</p><p>A person, who was below the rank of a martial Supreme, could actually control two ultimate maxims. This was simply unheard of and unbelievable.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack, aiming at a one-star Martial Emperor. He threw out a palm, and the person exploded in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other black-robed men also attacked.</p><p>There were two three-star martial emperors, four two-star martial emperors, and three one-star martial emperors in total.</p><p>There were nine people left.</p><p>Nine people attacking at the same time, their battle prowess was too terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s acupuncture points glowed. Dozens of holy weapons and a few sovereign weapons floated around him, forming the first layer of defense.</p><p>At the same time, the light of laws covered his body. The four laws circulated around his body, forming a second layer of defense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming changed his direction and rushed toward the depths of the ancient battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to avoid the attacks of the two three-star martial emperors. As for the other martial emperors, he could not avoid so many of them and could only take them head-on.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, at least five attacks hit Lu Ming.</p><p>Three two-star martial emperors and two one-star martial emperors.</p><p>The combat weapons that were floating around Lu Ming exploded like fireworks.</p><p>An absolute Saint weapon couldn’t block a martial sovereign’s attack at all.</p><p>In the end, only a few monarch weapons were still intact.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out a large mouthful of blood. Although the attacks were blocked by the combat weapon, there was still a strong force that bombarded his body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took the opportunity to rush in front of a one-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>The one-star Martial Emperor turned pale with fright. He wanted to escape but was killed in the air by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming pointed his finger out. A huge chaos finger of tribulation was formed and blasted toward a two-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>This finger contained four types of nomological laws, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>The two-star Martial Emperor tried his best to resist, but his body was still sent flying, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The others were shocked, and their attacks became even more violent.</p><p>A fearsome palm print and a blade of light were heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The two three-star martial sovereigns attacked again.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge, but he could not avoid it completely. He was hit by the palm print. The terrifying power almost cracked Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was in great pain. His bones seemed to be about to break, and he kept coughing up blood. However, his body rushed to the injured two-star martial sovereign in an instant with the help of the palm force.</p><p>The two-star Martial Emperor was shocked. He had received Lu Ming’s attack head-on and was almost blown up. He was severely injured. He was almost scared to death when he saw Lu Ming coming for him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
