What should we do now?”</p><p>In the clouds, an old man asked a young master.</p><p>This young master was dressed in silk clothes, and he had a dignified look.</p><p>this isn’t easy. Let’s wait for the people from fiendblade mountain to fight with the giant wolves in the valley First. We can just sit back and reap the benefits!</p><p>The young master smiled faintly.</p><p>“Young master is wise!”</p><p>The people beside the young master immediately started to flatter him, which made the young master quite happy.</p><p>Time flew by, and another half a day passed.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, fiendblade mountain’s leader waved his hand. Following that, his figure flickered and they rushed into the valley.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the valley, they were discovered by the giant wolves in the valley. Immediately, hundreds of giant wolves, under the leadership of giant wolf King, charged towards the people from fiendblade mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On demonic blade mountain, two Emperor-to-be rushed towards giant wolf King, while the other Emperor-to-be rushed towards the other giant wolves with the others.</p><p>The valley instantly fell into a chaotic battle.</p><p>Even though there were fewer people from fiendblade mountain, their strength was clearly stronger.</p><p>The people who came here were at least in the great saint realm, and half of them were in the absolute Saint realm. Under the leadership of an Emperor-to-be, a large number of giant wolves were killed.</p><p>Giant wolf King was also at a disadvantage against the two Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard the commotion outside.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not go out but continued to control the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb the demonic aura.</p><p>Not long after, the sounds of the battle outside gradually died down.</p><p>Under the siege of the two Emperor-to-be, giant wolf King’s Head was cut off by the leader of the other side.</p><p>More than half of the other giant wolves were also killed, and the rest scattered and fled the place.</p><p>“Haha, demon origin fruit!”</p><p>The eyes of the leader of fiendblade mountain revealed a greedy look as he looked at the cave where Lu Ming was.</p><p>“You want to obtain the demonic origin fruit with just your abilities?”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from outside the valley. Then, with a flash, a group of people rushed into the valley. It was the group of people who had been in the clouds.</p><p>The face of the chief of fiend blade mountain changed. He looked at the young Childe and the others, revealing a trace of vigilance,” “Who are you people?” “Do you recognize this?”</p><p>A black token appeared in the young master’s hand.</p><p>The moment fiendblade mountain’s people saw this token, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>you guys are from the eternal devil nation!</p><p>The leader of fiendblade mountain shouted.</p><p>The ancient devil nation was a Super Devil nation.</p><p>One should know that there were only two Super Devil nations in the entire land of myriad Devils. Each of them was shockingly powerful and were true overlords. They were not something their fiendblade mountain could resist.</p><p>Oh, so you’re an expert from the eternal devil nation. Pardon my rudeness. Since you’ve set your eyes on the demon origin fruit, we’ll let you have it then!</p><p>Fiendblade mountain’s leader squeezed out an ugly smile on his face. He was very unwilling in his heart.</p><p>“Give way? The ancient Luo nation doesn’t need you to give in! What I want, 1 will just take it. Attack and kill all these trash!”</p><p>The young master’s indifferent voice sounded.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The people around the young master immediately charged towards the people from fiendblade mountain.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>The Fiend blade mountain’s leader roared and turned into a fiend blade, wanting to rush out.</p><p>But the next moment, two figures blocked him.</p><p>Emperor-to-be, the two figures were both Emperor-to-be.</p><p>What made him desperate was that the other two emperors-to-be of the demonic blade mountain were facing the same situation as him. They were blocked by two emperors-to-be respectively.</p><p>The young master had brought an astonishing number of experts, at least six Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“We’ve already given up the demonic origin fruit. Why are you still trying to kill us?”</p><p>The leader of fiendblade mountain roared unwillingly.</p><p>hahaha, what a joke. You’re born in the land of ten thousand demons, yet you still ask such a question. Kill!</p><p>kill! the young master shouted. His subordinates all charged towards the people from fiendblade mountain.</p><p>The young Master’s Men were obviously stronger. Instantly, the people from fiendblade mountain were killed one after another.</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle. Not long after, the people of fiendblade mountain followed in the footsteps of the giant wolf. They were even more miserable than the giant wolf. Not a single one of them escaped and all of them stayed here.</p><p>In the land of infinite demons, such a battle was too normal.</p><p>Especially when they encountered treasures, the battle would be even more brutal.</p><p>Therefore, the fiendish cultivators in the land of myriad fiends were generally stronger in combat. In a battle of the same level, their combat strength was probably stronger than that of the people in the yuan mountain.</p><p>&Nbsp; the young master kept the storage rings and smiled coldly. He didn’t care at all and then led everyone towards the cave.</p><p>Their eyes lit up as soon as they entered the cave.</p><p>the three demon origin fruits are not ripe yet. However, they will be ripe in half an hour!</p><p>An old man judged.</p><p>“Eh? Why does the demonic Qi here keep flowing into the cave?”</p><p>Suddenly, some people discovered a problem. The demonic Qi here had been gathering towards the cave.</p><p>This was obviously not normal. They had once sent experts in to investigate and knew that there was a Devil’s Pool in the depths of the cave. The devil Qi should have been constantly spreading outside.</p><p>There was someone inside!</p><p>Everyone had the same thought.</p><p>The young master’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The young master said coldly. The group walked into the cave. Soon, they arrived at the demonic pool and saw Lu Ming.</p><p>The surging demonic Qi was constantly gathering towards the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>After more than ten days of absorption, the demonic Qi in the demonic pool had almost dried up.</p><p>this Golem is amazing. It can actually absorb demonic Qi.</p><p>the demonic Qi in the demonic pool is almost dried up. It couldn’t have been absorbed by this Golem, right? it’s a treasure!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>The young master’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>“Brat, you actually dared to secretly absorb the demonic Qi here. You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>The young man said coldly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and casually glanced around before uttering a word,” “Get lost!”</p><p>The young master’s face darkened instantly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death. Young master, I’ll go kill him!”</p><p>A burly man at the absolute Saint realm said.</p><p>“Let’s cripple him first and see what secrets he has!”</p><p>The young master ordered.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The burly man at the absolute Saint stage nodded his head. Then, his body moved like an eagle pouncing on its prey as he pounced towards Lu Ming. His claws were like blades as he grabbed at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>sword light! Lu Ming suddenly shouted. Two sword lights shot out from his eyes and rushed into the body of the burly man at the absolute Saint stage.</p><p>The burly man screamed in pain and fell to the ground. He twitched a few times and stopped breathing.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The expressions of the young master and the others changed.</p><p>An absolute Saint expert died just like that. What kind of technique was this?</p><p>“Young master, be careful! This kid is not simple!”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be said with a serious expression..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
