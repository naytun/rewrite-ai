Before they even made a move, their powerful auras were constantly colliding.</p><p>Yuhe was dressed in a black robe, and his entire body was suffused with the light of the laws of reincarnation. Behind him, there were six vortexes that were spinning non-stop. He wanted to let everything in the world enter reincarnation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yu He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. A long sword appeared in his hand. He slashed out and the long sword enlarged rapidly, turning into a huge sword.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there were six reincarnation vortexes on the giant sword that slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was filled with the light of the chaotic laws. He was fearless as he rushed towards Yuhe’s giant sword. At the same time, he used the chaotic divine palm and struck out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use any other laws. He simply used the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>He wanted to see how strong he was without using any other laws.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck Yu He’s huge sword. It was as if two divine weapons had collided and a terrifying vibration was produced.</p><p>A powerful force shot out and Yu He’s sword was sent flying by Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body also took a few steps back.</p><p>This move was evenly matched.</p><p>so powerful. How can the son of chaos be so powerful? ”</p><p>Many people were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Lu Ming was only in the perfection of an absolute Saint, but he could actually fight against Yu He.</p><p>Yuhe had already broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Once one reached the level of Emperor-to-be, the laws would be perfect and would form a River.</p><p>Moreover, when he broke through to the Emperor-to-be realm, both his body and Saint power would be tempered by the laws and would be greatly improved.</p><p>The great circle of the absolute Saint realm seemed to be only one step away from an Emperor-to-be, but the difference in strength was huge.</p><p>And now, both of them were the sons of God. However, Lu Ming’s ability to resist the Imperial River despite his cultivation being behind. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yuhe let out a long howl. His eyes were like two vortexes, as dark as ink. He strode forward and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless. He waved his palm and the two of them engaged in an intense confrontation.</p><p>The crowd could only see two figures clashing and fighting in the air. The scene was terrifying.</p><p>“Is this still the battle strength of an Emperor-to-be? This is comparable to a martial Supreme!”</p><p>the Son of God, once he breaks through to the Emperor-to-be realm, his combat strength is really comparable to a Martial Emperor!</p><p>1 heard that Yuhe just broke through to the Emperor-to-be realm not long ago, but he’s still a genuine Emperor-to-be. Lu Ming, who’s only a perfected absolute Saint, can actually fight with Yuhe!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Yu He had exchanged dozens of moves. Many people could not calm down and were discussing excitedly.</p><p>Of course, they did not know that Lu Ming had already perfected one of his laws. His body and Saint energy had been tempered once. Although it was only the tempering of the king path law, it had improved greatly.</p><p>Otherwise, it would have been difficult for Lu Ming to fight against Yu He with his cultivation base of a perfected ultimate Saint with only one chaos law.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could definitely block the other party.</p><p>Imperial River was equally shocked, but he was already really angry.</p><p>He was originally very ambitious and wanted to stand out in the battle of the ten lands. He wanted to be famous and obtain great opportunities.</p><p>But now, before the battle of the ten lands had even started, he had encountered an unprecedented setback.</p><p>With his Emperor-to-be cultivation, he couldn’t even take down a person in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>He was the Scion of Samsara, known to be invincible among his peers. But now, he couldn’t take down someone whose cultivation was lower than his. This was a huge blow to his self-confidence.</p><p>Therefore, he had to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Yuhe let out a long roar and used his strength to the maximum.</p><p>The sword whistled unceasingly. The six vortexes of the reincarnation vortex merged together and turned into a huge vortex. It wanted to pull Lu Ming into the vortex and reincarnate.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was like a rock in the sea, unmoving.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used the chaos finger of tribulation. With a point of his finger, a huge chaos finger of tribulation was formed and pointed at the huge reincarnation vortex.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two of them collided, creating a terrifying explosion. In the end, the two of them disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yu He retreated a thousand meters respectively and stood in the air.</p><p>Imperial river’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He could not take down Lu Ming and could only fight to a draw with him.</p><p>The other sons of God on the pillar were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. Once he broke into the Emperor-to-be realm, who could defeat him?</p><p>it seems that the world is full of geniuses. I have underestimated them in the past!</p><p>Yu He slowly spoke. At this moment, he had already regained his calm.</p><p>“You’re also very strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>let’s fight again in the ten lands battle!</p><p>After saying this, Yu He stepped out and returned to the gazing Emperor pillar.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the gazing Emperor pillar.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is really getting more and more terrifying!”</p><p>Wei Tiandao muttered.</p><p>The paragons of the yuan mountain felt it the most. They knew that Lu Ming still had a secret skill that he had not used. Back then, when he was fighting against the star River, Lu Ming had used that secret skill to defeat the star River.</p><p>If he used that secret technique, even Yu He wouldn’t be his match.</p><p>I heard that the people in the stellar River have long broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm. But now, it seems that even if the stellar River has broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm, they are not Lu Ming’s match!</p><p>Some of the heaven’s favorites from Mount Yuan discussed in low voices.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I didn’t even use my full strength!”</p><p>Chi Kai pursed his lips. He had seen Lu Ming’s moves before. He could easily kill a one-star illusionary Emperor. That kind of combat strength was far beyond what he had just displayed.</p><p>However, since Lu Ming did not reveal it, he would not tell anyone.</p><p>By now, there were more and more people here.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone spoke and looked to the East.</p><p>A figure was flying over at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the next moment, the light receded, and a young man appeared in the air.</p><p>“It’s him, death blade!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This young man was indeed the death blade.</p><p>In the next moment, another streak of light flew over from the West, and a young man appeared.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized this young man. He was the son of death of the eternal devil nation in the land of infinite Devils, GE long.</p><p>It was obvious that they were the two people who were fighting.</p><p>“Come on stage and let’s decide the winner!”</p><p>GE long looked at the death blade.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>The death blade said indifferently.</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, stepping onto the ancient Emperor stage.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them stood opposite each other, and a terrifying aura of death emanated from their bodies at the same time.</p><p>The auras of death clashed, as though they wanted to turn the ancient Emperor stage into a kingdom of death.</p><p>It was extremely rare for the children of God of the same law to fight, and everyone watched without blinking.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it more seriously. After all, he had also comprehended the death law.</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them moved. They turned into two shadows and charged at each other, fighting fiercely.</p><p>The entire ancient Emperor stage had turned into a land of death, and it was covered by the laws of death.</p><p>Many people revealed a look of fear. Now, if an ordinary person stepped into that area, they would probably be instantly deprived of their vitality by the law of death and die on the spot..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
