It was called Aeon city and had existed for countless years.</p><p>This ancient city was occupied by several large forces. In history, it had produced more than one heavenly Emperor and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Recently, in Aeon city, there was a famous statue of the celestial Emperor that had actually revived. It revealed the aura of the heavenly path and could help people comprehend the path, attracting countless people.</p><p>Furthermore, the battle of the ten lands was just around the corner. Countless people from all over the land had rushed over, so there were naturally more people.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them walked on the street, their eyes sweeping around and they were amazed.</p><p>Aeon city was no smaller than heavenly Emperor City in Yuan mountain. In fact, it was even more majestic.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at their destination, the celestial Emperor’s statue.</p><p>A huge statue, carved from Jade, stood at the center of Aeon city. It was a thousand meters tall.</p><p>This was a middle-aged man with an ordinary appearance. Fie stood with his hands behind his back, but he had a kind of aura that could swallow the world and sweep away the world.</p><p>This was the celestial Emperor’s statue!</p><p>Originally, it was just a statue. But now, rays of divine light appeared on the statue, illuminating the entire area. A mysterious aura filled the air.</p><p>“Aeon city, is there a heavenly Emperor now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was not calm either.</p><p>No. Legend has it that there are almost no celestial emperors in the primordial realm!</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>“No heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest were puzzled.</p><p>yes, I’ve also heard that most of the celestial emperors have gone to the heaven realm to participate in the war. Perhaps a few of them are still in the primordial realm, but it has been a long time since a Celestial Emperor has appeared!</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Since the primordial realm’s ancient times, there must have been some celestial emperors. Celestial emperors no longer faced any major tribulations and had endless lifespans. Their combat strength was unparalleled. If they did not encounter a great enemy, they would almost not die.</p><p>But now, it was almost impossible to see the celestial Emperor in the primordial realm, so it was very likely that he had really gone to the heaven realm to participate in the war.</p><p>For example, it was impossible for the yuan mountain to have only given birth to the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor over the years. There must have been other heavenly emperors.</p><p>“How intense is the war in the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>The celestial Thearch had gone to the heaven realm to participate in the war, so one could imagine how terrifying the war was.</p><p>Many people were sitting cross-legged under the huge statue of the celestial Emperor, and most of them were young people.</p><p>According to the introduction of an elder at the side, although the resurrection of the heavenly Emperor’s statue was wonderful, it was mainly useful for martial artists below the martial Supreme realm or low-level void sovereigns. It would not be as useful for those with higher cultivation.</p><p>“Let’s go over too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, bi Kai, Luo Zhan, and the others walked to the statue of the celestial Emperor and sat cross-legged in an empty space.</p><p>Along the way, they saw quite a few chosen. Most of the children of heaven who had appeared on the gazing Emperor pillar were here.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and closed his eyes. His mind was empty. Suddenly, he felt a force enveloping him. The force seemed to make his mind pass through layers of space and become one with the heavenly Dao.</p><p>The heavenly Dao contained everything. All the laws of the world were contained in the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he began to comprehend the death law. He felt that at this moment, he had a very clear understanding of the death law.</p><p>It was even clearer and faster than when he was under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>“This is a good place!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and started to comprehend quietly.</p><p>His main focus was on the law of death and the law of devouring.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and the two laws progressed at lightning speed.</p><p>Every day, he would spend half of his time comprehending the death law and the other half comprehending the devour law.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had already reached 85% of the death rule and 92% of the devour rule.</p><p>The comprehension of nomological laws became more and more difficult as one progressed. It was already amazing to have such a great harvest in a month.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was in the midst of comprehending when he suddenly felt his hair stand on end. He sensed a murderous intent enveloping him.</p><p>Although he was cultivating, he had to pay some attention to the outside world. If someone was hostile to him, he would be immediately alerted.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and looked behind him.</p><p>Behind him, a young man was walking over, looking at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man stopped not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The young man spoke indifferently, his voice filled with cold arrogance.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. He did not know this person, but he could sense that this person had ill intentions.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>At this moment, many people around the statue were not cultivating. They noticed Lu Ming and the young man.</p><p>“It’s Mu Yang, Mu yang of the MU clan!”</p><p>he’s an extremely terrifying heaven’s favorite. It’s said that he’s the child of the void who controls the void’s laws. He’s reached the Emperor-to-be realm a long time ago!</p><p>“Who is that young man? Muyang seems to be hostile to him!”</p><p>I know. That young man is from Mount Yuan. He’s the son of chaos and is in the great circle of the ultimate Saint realm. He defeated Yuhe, the son of Samsara who is in the Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>“What? He was the son of chaos? He defeated the son of Samsara, who was in the Emperor-to-be realm, with his cultivation at the peak of the ultimate Saint realm?”</p><p>Many people were shocked after hearing the truth.</p><p>The son of chaos was already shocking enough. Moreover, he was in the great circle of the ultimate Saint realm and defeated the son of Samsara, who was at the Emperor-to-be level. This was even more shocking.</p><p>“My name is Muyang, and yuanxin is my good friend!”</p><p>At this moment, the young man spoke.</p><p>“Yuanxin?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He had never heard of this name before. What did Muyang looking for him have to do with this Yuan Xin?</p><p>my good friend Yuan Xin is also a son of chaos. You’ve met him before!</p><p>Mu yang said indifferently.</p><p>son of chaos? could it be him? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. He thought of the son of chaos he had met during the Hunyuan sect’s assessment.</p><p>Yuan Xin once mentioned you. He said that you’ve mastered the chaos Scripture of the chaos Thearch. He’s now in seclusion to break through to a higher realm. As his good friend, I naturally have to share his burden. Hand over your chaos Scripture!</p><p>Mu yang said indifferently. Although his voice wasn’t heavy, it had a commanding tone.</p><p>“It really is that person!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The only person who knew that Lu Ming had the chaos Scripture was the son of chaos, who had also been to the chaos Hall.</p><p>The son of chaos was extremely rare. It was even more difficult to produce than the other sons of God. For the time being, Lu Ming had not heard of any other son of chaos who could control the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to get the chaos Scripture!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice cold.</p><p>“Oh, so you’re going to fight me? Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you defeated Yuhe. There are many people stronger than Yuhe in the divine land!”</p><p>Mu yang said coldly.</p><p>“Try it and you’ll know!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out from Mu Yang’s body. Waves of energy rushed towards Lu Ming like shock waves.</p><p>Lu Ming also released his aura to resist..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
