He rushed in another direction, wanting to rush down the fighting stage.</p><p>He no longer had the heart to fight. At this moment, there was only fear in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. It had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>His fighting spirit had already collapsed.</p><p>In this case, he was even less of a match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and the long black spear kept stabbing out. In the end, it pierced through Huang song’s left leg and pinned him to the ground.</p><p>you’re just a piece of trash. You don’t even have the courage to fight. Where’s your arrogance from before? ”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and stepped on Huang song’s face, looking down at him.</p><p>Previously, Huang Song had been extremely arrogant. When he had defeated Wu Xi, he had called Wu Xi trash and said that he did not even have the courage to fight.</p><p>But now, facing Lu Ming, he was the same.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had returned this sentence to him, it was really ironic.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, save me!”</p><p>Huang Song roared, asking for help from Princess you ning.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t overdo it!”</p><p>At this moment, Princess you ning spoke.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Princess you ning and berated her,” “Are you blind or deaf? before this, when Huang Song was killing our people, why didn’t you tell us to stop?”</p><p>“Also, it was Huang Song who said he wanted to kill me just now, why didn’t you try to stop him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s sarcastic voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Princess you ning’s face turned extremely ugly.</p><p>“Impudent! Who Do You Think You Are? how dare you talk to the princess like that? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>An expert from the you family shouted and exploded with a powerful aura.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The master of the Luo family said coldly. He glanced at the you family powerhouse, and the latter’s expression changed.</p><p>“Brother you, don’t break the rules!”</p><p>The head of the Luo family said coldly.</p><p>“Sit down!”</p><p>The you family master glanced at the you family expert, who could only restrain his aura and retreat obediently.</p><p>The competition between the two clans happened once every ten thousand years. It had been countless years, so there were naturally rules. No one else was allowed to interfere.</p><p>Otherwise, the youluo demonic Kingdom’s Senate would immediately declare the party who broke the rules as the loser.</p><p>“This kid is interesting!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Luo clan smiled.</p><p>“Good scolding, good scolding!”</p><p>Luo Xuan laughed out loud, as if he had vented his anger.</p><p>This made Princess you ning’s face turn even uglier.</p><p>“Now, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Huang Song.</p><p>“Don’t…”</p><p>Huang Song struggled with all his might, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s spear fell and pierced through the space between his eyebrows, killing Huang Song.</p><p>Many people at the scene let out a long breath.</p><p>Huang Song was dead. He had been killed by an unknown youth.</p><p>The strongest heaven’s favorite from the youluo demonic kingdom, other than the king body, was killed after a few moves by Lu Ming. This made everyone fearful of Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“This kid, how is he so strong, how is he so strong?”</p><p>Ji Peng was incomparably terrified.</p><p>“Don’t worry, if this kid encounters me, I’ll take revenge for Huang Song!”</p><p>Ji Tian said coldly, his cold eyes staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have sensed something. He turned back to look at Ji Tian, smiled faintly, and returned to the stands.</p><p>“There’s hope!”</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of some powerhouses of the Luo family lit up. They saw hope.</p><p>Although they were few in number, they now saw hope.</p><p>That was because both sides had a King body.</p><p>If the two King physiques of the two sides met before Lu Ming met Ji Tian, and both of them were injured like you ning and Luo Xuan, then they would have a chance of winning.</p><p>If the king physique on both sides were injured, who else in the you family could be Lu Ming’s match? Lu Ming alone could annihilate the other party.</p><p>Obviously, the you family had thought of this as well, and their faces darkened.</p><p>Because of Lu Ming, the situation that they were in control of had an unpredictable turn.</p><p>“Don’t worry, they won’t have a chance!”</p><p>Ji Tian spoke with great confidence.</p><p>“Could it be that you’ve already…”</p><p>You ning seemed to have thought of something, and his face lit up.</p><p>“Not bad!” Ji Tian nodded.</p><p>You ning was overjoyed and heaved a sigh of relief. This way, they were sure to win.</p><p>“If you see Lu Ming, kill him for me!”</p><p>You ning sent a voice transmission to Ji Tian.</p><p>If it was as Ji Tian had said, Lu Ming would meet Ji Tian sooner or later.</p><p>Everyone had different thoughts in their minds, but the competition continued.</p><p>When this round was over.</p><p>There were only three people left on the Luo family’s side.</p><p>The you family only had nine people left.</p><p>A new round began.</p><p>This round did not have a big battle that attracted too much attention.</p><p>Lu Ming easily defeated his opponent, and so did the Luo family’s Royal body.</p><p>However, on the Luo family’s side, another person had also been defeated by the opponent’s expert.</p><p>In this way, there were only two people left in the Luo family.</p><p>As for the you family, there were only seven people left.</p><p>“You family’s number two, Luo family’s number two!”</p><p>When the founding elder announced the number, everyone was excited.</p><p>Finally, it was time for the main event.</p><p>The you family’s number two was Ji Tian, and the Luo family’s number two was the king body, Long Yan.</p><p>The king physique of the two sides were about to battle again.</p><p>In the past, Ji Tian was known as the number one person among the younger generation in youluo demonic kingdom. His cultivation had long reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>However, Long Yan wasn’t weaker than him. His cultivation had long reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>The last time the two of them fought was a few years ago. At that time, the two of them had fought for hundreds of moves, and in the end, Long Yan lost to Ji Tian by one move.</p><p>However, a few years had passed, and anything could happen. Ji Tian might not be able to defeat Long Yan now.</p><p>“They finally matched!”</p><p>The eyes of the Luo family’s experts lit up, and their faces were filled with joy.</p><p>Finally, before Lu Ming met Ji Tian, the two King physiques went against each other. This was what they wanted to see and their only hope of winning.</p><p>As long as Ji Tian and Long Yan were both injured, Lu Ming would be able to sweep away the remaining people of the you family and the Luo family would win this time.</p><p>Long Yan, we don’t seek victory in this battle. However, we can’t let Ji Tian win either!</p><p>The head of the Luo family sent a message to Long Yan.</p><p>Long Yan nodded and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Ji Tian also stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Long Yan, you were no match for me a few years ago. Today, you will not be my match either!</p><p>Ji Tian spoke with great confidence and an invincible belief.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Long Yan said indifferently. Then, he took a step forward, and his body was covered in terrifying flames.</p><p>This kind of flame was an extremely terrifying flame law. It was called the destructive Heavenly Fire law, and it was also a King path law.</p><p>“The sixth prison!”</p><p>Ji Tian said softly. Six worlds seemed to have appeared around him.</p><p>One was a sea of blood, one was filled with boundless demonic Qi, and one was filled with killing intent…</p><p>“So it’s the law of the six Hells!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
