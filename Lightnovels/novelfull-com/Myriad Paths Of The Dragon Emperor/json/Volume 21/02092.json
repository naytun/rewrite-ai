The terrifying palm force directly tore apart the other party’s defense.</p><p>The two-star Martial Emperor screamed as he was torn apart by Lu Ming and died on the spot.</p><p>The others gasped. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. It was far beyond what they had heard. He could even kill a two-star Martial Emperor. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Kill! This kind of person must be killed!”</p><p>The eyes of the assassins of the death god nation were filled with madness.</p><p>Now, they no longer cared about how many raw gemstones Muyang would give them. They wanted to kill Lu Ming more.</p><p>The remaining assassins attacked Lu Ming with all their might.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and circulated the death law with all his might. The death Qi from all directions continued to gather, strengthening Lu Ming’s attack and defense.</p><p>In this ancient battlefield, the law of death could exert its greatest power, far beyond normal.</p><p>Therefore, on this ancient battlefield, Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger than in other places.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward and fought with the experts of the death god nation.</p><p>The two three-star martial sovereigns were the biggest threats to him.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current strength was strong and he could kill a two-star Martial Emperor, he was still not a match for a three-star Martial Emperor.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming successfully killed another one-star Martial Emperor. However, he was also hit by a three-star Martial Emperor and two two two-star illusionary emperors. A few terrifying wounds appeared on Lu Ming’s body. Blood flowed out, and many of his bones and bones were broken.</p><p>Fortunately, the air of death here was too thick. It greatly increased Lu Ming’s defense and he managed to survive.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a killing frenzy. His black hair danced wildly and his body was bathed in blood. He looked like a demonic god.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A two-star illusionary Emperor was sent flying by Lu Ming and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and rushed into the depths of the ancient battlefield.</p><p>In the depths of the ancient battlefield, the Qi of death was even denser, which was more beneficial to him.</p><p>“Send out the news and ask Milord to personally take action!”</p><p>A three-star Martial Emperor roared angrily and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, their losses were too heavy.</p><p>Previously, they had thought that Lu Ming’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than an ordinary one-star illusionary Emperor and not as strong as a two-star illusionary Emperor. However, they had mobilized four two-star illusionary emperors and two three-star illusionary emperors, so it could be said that they were absolutely safe.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was much stronger than he had imagined.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed four to five people in a row, but he had not been killed. If this went on, Lu Ming might be able to escape into the depths of the ancient battlefield.</p><p>This was something they could not tolerate.</p><p>Very few of the people the death god nation wanted to kill could escape.</p><p>The rest of the people were pursuing Lu Ming with all their might. One of them had already spread the news.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming, who was running at top speed, was hit by a palm force. This was the palm force of a three-star illusionary Emperor. It was exceptionally powerful. Lu Ming was sent flying, and his body was in severe pain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were determined and he moved forward at high speed.</p><p>From the other party’s roar, it was obvious that there were more powerful people nearby. Lu Ming had to escape into the depths of the ancient battlefield to have a chance of survival.</p><p>“Who is it that wants to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>He didn’t know anyone from the death god nation, and from the way these people attacked, they were obviously more like assassins.</p><p>Who was it that hired an assassin to kill him?</p><p>“Muyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Muyang. The most likely candidate was Muyang.</p><p>“Muyang, I will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with murderous intent. At the same time, he ran forward with all his might.</p><p>During this process, Lu Ming’s body squirmed and his injuries were healing rapidly.</p><p>Now, his spirit body was too strong, and his life force was extremely vigorous. Although he was severely injured, his recovery speed was also very shocking.</p><p>The rest of the assassins continued to pursue and attack Lu Ming. Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge but he would be hit by the attacks occasionally.</p><p>Fortunately, the aura of death here was getting thicker and thicker. To Lu Ming, it was very beneficial.</p><p>His entire body was covered in death Qi, forming a suit of armor that covered his entire body.</p><p>He was in control of the law of death. The Qi of death was beneficial to him, but to others, it was like poison.</p><p>When an ordinary person faced the aura of death, the aura of death would constantly corrode them.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The remaining assassins had to use a portion of their power to resist the attack of the death Qi.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, I’ll make you pay a price!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were shining with madness.</p><p>His running body suddenly stopped, and then with an extremely fast speed, he pounced back.</p><p>The assassins thought that Lu Ming was trying his best to escape. They did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly turn around and kill them. They were stunned for a moment.</p><p>Although it was only for a moment, for experts like them, a moment could determine their life and death.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and killed the last one-star illusionary Emperor. Then, he moved his body and attacked the other two-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, the two-star illusionary Emperor finally reacted. He activated the power of the world and slashed out a terrifying sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and directly dispersed the sword light. The terrifying palm force bombarded the body of the two-star illusionary Emperor. The man screamed in pain as his chest was pierced through. A large hole appeared in his chest, and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>How could Lu Ming let him escape? he moved and gave chase.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other assassins roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming growled as he controlled the remaining sovereign weapons to block behind him. At the same time, endless death Qi gathered to form a thick Wall of Death behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the attacks behind him and charged at the two-star illusionary Emperor with all his might.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two-star illusionary Emperor had already been severely injured. At this time, although he tried his best to resist, he still could not withstand it. After a few moves, Lu Ming’s palm struck his head. His head exploded like a watermelon, and his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>The other assassins ‘attacks fell behind Lu Ming.</p><p>A few sovereign weapons trembled and almost exploded. Cracks appeared on them and the thick Wall of Death was destroyed. All kinds of attacks landed on Lu Ming, sending him flying like a cannonball and crashing into a mountain.</p><p>But in the next moment, the mountain roared and Lu Ming rushed out of the mountain, continuing to rush into the depths of the ancient battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming coughed up blood. Fortunately, the few sovereign weapons and the Wall of Death had blocked most of the power. Otherwise, he would have been in danger after being hit by so many attacks.</p><p>Even so, he was severely injured.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The remaining assassins were so angry that they almost vomited blood. Lu Ming had killed two more of them. It was a great loss.</p><p>They had suffered a huge loss in this deal. However, as long as they could kill Lu Ming, it was worth it.</p><p>They did not let go of Lu Ming and continued to pursue him.</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying sword radiance burst forth in the sky and slashed at Lu Ming. It was extremely terrifying as if it wanted to split the heavens and earth.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. His figure kept changing to avoid the sword light..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
