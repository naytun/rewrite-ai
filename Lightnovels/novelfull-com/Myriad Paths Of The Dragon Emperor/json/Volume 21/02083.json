He wanted to pull the death blade into the abyss of death and bury him.</p><p>The death blade moved extremely fast, trying to Dodge, but the abyss of death was too big, covering the sky. The death blade was instantly drawn into the abyss of death.</p><p>Was the death blade going to lose?</p><p>Many people were moved.</p><p>it’s not that easy. They’re all children of death, and their cultivation levels are similar. It’s not that easy to determine the winner!</p><p>Someone shook his head.</p><p>As expected, the abyss of death trembled and a terrifying blade light broke out from the abyss of death.</p><p>“Heavenly blade of death!”‘</p><p>kill! a cold voice came from the abyss of death, and a huge blade light slashed out from the abyss of death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The abyss of death trembled and exploded. A figure with a terrifying blade light rushed out of the abyss of death.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The death blade rushed out, and its blade light soared into the sky. Each blade carried a terrifying aura of death. As the blade light passed, even space seemed to fall into a dead silence.</p><p>GE long shouted and continued to fight with the death blade.</p><p>the usage of each nomological law is different. Different people can use the same nomological law differently even if they master it!</p><p>Lu Ming looked ar it seriously and pondered.</p><p>Looking at the battle between the death blade and GE long, Lu Ming seemed to have come to a realization.</p><p>His comprehension of the law of death had deepened.</p><p>Death blade and GE long had been fighting for hundreds of moves. At this time, both of them were exhausted. It was a competition of individual will and combat experience.</p><p>‘I will definitely win!”</p><p>The death blade howled, his hair flying in the air. His eyes were filled with unyielding battle intent.</p><p>It was as if he wanted to defeat anything that was placed in front of him.</p><p>His blade of death became even sharper and more dazzling as it continuously slashed towards GE long.</p><p>GE long was gradually at a disadvantage.</p><p>“The death blade is going to win!”</p><p>the death blade’s willpower is even stronger. It’s even stronger than GE Long’s!</p><p>“We re both children of death, but the victor will be decided today!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>After another dozen or so moves, GE long was no match for the blade of death. A deep wound appeared on his body, and it was constantly corroding him. Even though he had mastered the law of death, it was difficult to erase it in a short time.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>GE long spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body trembled as if he couldn’t believe that he had lost to the death blade.</p><p>Before the battle of the ten lands had even started, he had been defeated at the hands of another son of death.</p><p>This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>The others also sighed.</p><p>After this battle, the death blade had revealed his abilities and defeated another Son of God. He had strengthened his belief and his belief that he would not lose.</p><p>After this battle, the death blade would definitely transform and reach a higher level.</p><p>On the contrary, GE Long s will would probably be affected, and he would be even more vulnerable when facing the death blade in the future.</p><p>This was also why when the same kind of children of God met, they would definitely fight.</p><p>Because only by defeating the same kind of child of God and stepping on the other could one make themselves stronger and forge an undefeatable belief and step onto the peak.</p><p>This time, in the golden age, there might be more than two children of death, but at least the death blade had already defeated one and could continue to compete for the throne.</p><p>As for GE long, he had already lost the qualification to become the strongest son of death.</p><p>Unless he had a fortuitous encounter later on, it would be very difficult for him to turn the tables.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>The death blade said indifferently.</p><p>“I will defeat you in the battle of the ten lands!”</p><p>GE long said. He couldn’t admit defeat just like that. Otherwise, he would never be a match for the death blade.</p><p>“After today’s defeat, you will be even less of a match for me in the future!”</p><p>The death blade spoke with an undefeatable belief. He then rose into rhe air and left.</p><p>After the death blade left, GE long also left, and the battle ended.</p><p>“Haha, let me tell you, the death blade also came from my Yuan mountain!”</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of Mount Youyuan laughed.</p><p>This surprised some people.</p><p>Lu Ming was also from Mount Yuan. He had just defeated a Scion of Samsara, and it was a shocking fear for rhe weak to defeat rhe strong.</p><p>And this rime, the death blade had defeated another child of death, and this child of death was also from Mount Yuan.</p><p>The yuan mountain was incredible, A few terrifying heaven’s favorites had appeared one after another.</p><p>Were there really six sons of God in Yuan mountain?</p><p>Some of the geniuses had serious expressions.</p><p>On the gazing-the-Emperor pillar, the children of heaven glanced at Lu Ming before they rose into the air and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!11</p><p>Some of the geniuses came over to greet Lu Ming. They were all from the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Some of them were even enemies with Lu Ming back then.</p><p>Because at that time, there were four alliances in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, such as the divine fire Alliance and the Knight’s Alliance.</p><p>Now, the leader of the Knight’s Association was smiling and greeting Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Luo!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The leader of the Knight’s Association was called Luo Zhan.</p><p>brother Lu, you’re getting stronger and stronger. I’m already far behind you now!</p><p>Luo Zhan sighed.</p><p>He had a King body and was now an Emperor-to-be, but Lu Ming could even defeat the Son of Heaven, an Emperor-to-be. He was even worse.</p><p>“Brother Luo, you’re too polite. Oh right, you guys came here a few days earlier. Have you seen Long Chen, Huang Li, and the others?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>From what he knew, Long Chen, desolate power, and a few others had already arrived at the divine fate land. Logically speaking, if they were nearby, they should have come to watch such a big show. However, Lu Ming did not see a single one of them.</p><p>half a month ago, I did see Long Chen and Huang Li. The two of them were adventuring together. However, 1 haven’t seen them recently. They must have left this region and headed towards destiny city!</p><p>Luo Zhan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The battle of the ten lands was getting closer and closer, it was possible that they had already reached destiny city.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you guys going to Aeon city? It’s said that after entering Aeon city, the celestial Emperor s statue will awaken and emit the aura of rhe heavenly Dao. It’s extremely mysterious and can help one comprehend the Dao. Many people have headed to Aeon city!”</p><p>Luo Zhan said.</p><p>“The celestial Emperor’s statue has been revived?”</p><p>Lu Ming, the sword split open, and Qiu Yue were all shocked.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s statue was no small matter.</p><p>“Don’t you know? We can go together!”</p><p>Luo Zhan said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Those who could reach the heavenly Emperor realm were all extremely powerful, as could be seen from the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
