The power was indeed stronger than that of Yuan tuo.</p><p>However, Lu Ming threw a punch and directly destroyed the saber Light, sending the other party flying.</p><p>One move, another move!</p><p>His opponent had a King body in the perfected absolute Saint realm. His combat strength was definitely powerful. Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, but he could defeat his opponent in one move. This shocked many people.</p><p>what powerful combat power. One punch and he’s done it like a piece of rotten wood. His fighting style is a bit like an ancient Devil’s. There are no nomological law fluctuations either!</p><p>Someone was puzzled.</p><p>“I heard before that he defeated Cang Yan. 1 was suspicious before, but now it seems that it might be true.”</p><p>Another person recalled Luo Xuan’s words.</p><p>Cang Yan’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Initially, some people might not have taken Luo Xuan’s words seriously. However, Lu Ming had truly displayed his strength and confirmed Luo Xuan’s words. He had once been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get off the fighting stage! You’re just a nobody. How are you qualified to fight in the ring?”</p><p>Cang Yan shouted, wanting Lu Ming to step down.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept over Cang Yan as he berated,” this is between me and the heaven’s favorite of the immortal demon nation. Shut up, you piece of trash!</p><p>“You … What did you just say?”</p><p>Being called trash by Lu Ming in public, Cang Yan was furious and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“My defeated general, who was defeated by the immortal demon nation, still has the face to talk big here. If he’s not trash, then what is he? If I were you, I’d just destroy my own cultivation and stop cultivating martial arts!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated loudly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Cang Yan’s body trembled, his face turning red from anger.</p><p>How dare you! You’re so vicious at such a young age. You want to destroy my state of mind. You deserve to be killed!</p><p>The ashen Demon King bellowed, his eyes filled with cold killing intent. His powerful aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cang mo, you shouldn’t interfere in the matters of the younger generation!”</p><p>At this moment, the ancient Emperor spoke up. With a slight wave of his hand, the aura of the Azure Demon King disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Previously, he had given the authority to the Azure Demon King during the contest in the eternal demon nation. Since the other party did not allow Lu Ming to participate, he could not be bothered.</p><p>But now, the eternal demon nation had lost all their face. Lu Ming had just defeated two of his men and managed to save some face. Naturally, he wouldn’t allow the ashen Demon King to act rashly.</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s expression changed when he heard the ancient Emperor’s words. He hurriedly bowed and sat down, but his cold eyes would still sweep over Lu Ming from time to time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, more and more geniuses of the immortal demon nation arrived on the fighting ring, wanting to challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>“You guys are not my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and did not look at them again. Instead, he stepped into the air and walked toward the ancient devil.</p><p>What was he doing?</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded. Lu Ming was actually walking toward the ancient demon?</p><p>Even the few sons of God at the scene revealed surprised expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the front of the ancient devil, his eyes filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve encountered an ancient devil Dao. Battle me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>His voice was clear and calm, but it was like a gust of wind that swept in all directions.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to challenge the ancient devil?</p><p>“I… Did 1 hear him right? he wants to challenge the ancient devil?”</p><p>it’s true. 1 heard it too. He wants to challenge the ancient devil. Crazy. He’s crazy!</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>To them, this was truly inconceivable.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge the ancient devil.</p><p>Just now, ancient devil had displayed his terrifying strength and defeated two sons of God in a row. His combat strength was so strong that it shocked everyone.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was challenging the ancient devil?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Although he had displayed great combat strength and easily defeated yuantuo and the others, there were rumors that he had defeated Cang Yan.</p><p>But so what, they were on completely different levels. A figure like Cang Yan would probably be crushed in a single move by the ancient devil.</p><p>Many people felt that Lu Ming had gone crazy.</p><p>Luo Xuan, Wu Xi, the Luo family’s head, and the others were also dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, he could not be compared to the ancient demon, who was a rare genius.</p><p>you overestimate yourself. You think you have some strength and you’re arrogant!</p><p>You ning sneered coldly.</p><p>“Playing to the gallery, it’s just playing to the gallery!”</p><p>Cang Yan sneered loudly, thinking that Lu Ming was just trying to please the crowd.</p><p>The ancient Emperor, undying Emperor, and the other top experts were all curious.</p><p>He knew ancient Devil’s power, but he still dared to challenge him in public. Was he really trying to attract attention?</p><p>Just as the crowd was thinking about this or discussing animatedly, Lu Ming’s aura suddenly exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s body, the Holy power surged like a mighty river, turning into a pillar of holy power that soared into the sky.</p><p>what a strong and condensed Saint energy!</p><p>such Saint energy fluctuations aren’t weaker than that of an absolute Saint in the perfection or peak. No wonder he’s so powerful!</p><p>Sensing Lu Ming’s holy power, some people were discussing in shock.</p><p>However, the next moment, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>In the void, a dusky light flashed and intertwined with Lu Ming’s Saint energy, making Lu Ming’s aura even stronger.</p><p>Laws!</p><p>The Laws of Chaos!</p><p>Everyone could tell at a glance that this was the law of chaos.</p><p>But this was not the end!</p><p>The next moment, a Halo surrounded Lu Ming, making him look like a god of War.</p><p>This was the light of chaos!</p><p>At this moment, many people’s expressions were extremely interesting.</p><p>For example, you ning, Ji Tian, Cang Yan, and the others could open their mouths so wide that they could swallow a dead rat.</p><p>And their expressions were as if they had really swallowed a dead rat. They were full of shock, disbelief, and disbelief.</p><p>As for Luo Xuan, her mouth was slightly agape, and her face was filled with surprise.</p><p>“Son of chaos, it’s the son of chaos!”</p><p>At this moment, someone finally shouted.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar!</p><p>The son of chaos. It turned out that Lu Ming was the son of chaos!</p><p>No wonder Lu Ming was so powerful and confident. He said that the other geniuses of the undying Empire were no match for him and challenged the ancient devil directly.</p><p>The son of chaos, who had cultivated the light of law, was indeed qualified to challenge the ancient devil!</p><p>Those who had previously thought that Lu Ming was trying to please the crowd, that he was overestimating his abilities, and that he was crazy, all shut up.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s eyes shone with joy.</p><p>Who would have thought that in the eternal devil nation, other than the child of death and the child of void, there would be another child of chaos?</p><p>“Ancient One, how can a genius like this be nameless in the eternal devil nation? Hahaha! Is this how your eternal devil nation treats a child of the heavens? You’ve really made me see you in a new light!”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s face darkened as well.</p><p>For a son of chaos to be nameless in the eternal devil nation and not even have the right to participate in the competition, if word got out, he would probably become a laughingstock. Some of the geniuses might even be disheartened..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
