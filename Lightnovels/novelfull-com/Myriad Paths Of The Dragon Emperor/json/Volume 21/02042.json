Two young men caught Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>This was because these two people were exceptionally powerful. They were the sons of God.</p><p>“Child of the void, child of death!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>One of the two sons of God controlled the void law, which was also one of the ten ultimate laws. It was extremely terrifying and could turn everything into nothingness.</p><p>The other person actually mastered the law of death, just like the death blade.</p><p>Today was indeed a Golden Age. In the past, it was already amazing for a Son of God to appear. But now, they were appearing frequently, and different people had successfully cultivated the same law.</p><p>This was only the yuan mountain and the land of myriad demons. One had to know that there were ten lands in the primordial realm.</p><p>One could imagine that there would be more than one child of God.</p><p>It was easy to imagine that if the death blade met this person, a great battle would probably break out.</p><p>Apart from these two, Cang Yan’s strength was indeed very strong. He was undefeatable and was a popular candidate for the top three.</p><p>After a few days of intense battles, all the rankings were out.</p><p>Luo Xuan and you ning were ranked at the twenty-second place. They had not even made it into the top twenty.</p><p>As for Ji Tian, he had cultivated the light of law and was indeed powerful. He overcame all obstacles and charged into the top ten, ranking sixth.</p><p>After all, there were very few people who could cultivate the light of laws in a King’s body.</p><p>As for Cang Yan, after a series of battles, he had finally defeated his competitor and obtained third place.</p><p>The first and second were naturally the two sons of God.</p><p>The two sons of God had reached the perfected absolute Saint realm and were very close to the Emperor-to-be realm. They had also cultivated the light of laws and were extremely powerful. They were high above everyone else and were invincible.</p><p>The most exciting part was the battle between the two sons of God, which pushed the atmosphere to the peak.</p><p>The void law and the death law collided. Both laws were extremely overbearing, and their cultivation levels were similar. It took a thousand moves before the victor was decided.</p><p>In the end, the son of death won by a hair’s breadth due to his mastery of nomological laws and his close proximity to an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing! Is this the battle power of the Son of Heaven? It’s really terrifying!”</p><p>Luo Xuan blinked his large eyes in amazement.</p><p>the Son of God is indeed powerful. Below the Martial Emperor realm, ordinary Warriors are no match for the Son of God in a battle of the same level. It’s useless no matter how strong their combat strength is!</p><p>You ning also sighed and glanced at Lu Ming.</p><p>What he meant was that if he wasn’t the Son of God, no matter how strong he was, he wouldn’t be a match for the Son of God.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, sighing in his heart.</p><p>If he were to make a move, he would definitely be able to enter the top three.</p><p>Although the two sons of God were strong, he was not afraid.</p><p>What a pity!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He picked up a glass of wine and finished it in one gulp.</p><p>You ning thought that Lu Ming had realized the difference between him and the Son of God and thus had such an expression. He sneered immediately.</p><p>the top three can make a request to me. You may step forward!</p><p>The voice of the ancient Emperor rang out.</p><p>The two sons of God and Cang Yan stepped forward.</p><p>At this moment, Cang Yan was extremely excited.</p><p>He had to make a request to the great emperor and make use of it to its greatest value.</p><p>“Do you want an ancient scripture, or do you want to take the opportunity to become the great Emperor’s disciple?”</p><p>Cang Yan’s mind spun rapidly as he trembled with excitement.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s so lively today. 1’11 join in the fun!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh reverberated through the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Then, the sky rumbled, as if a giant creature was about to break through the void.</p><p>Many experts ‘faces darkened as they looked into the distance.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The next moment, the void cracked open, and a huge warship sailed out of the dark void.</p><p>The battleship was 10000 meters long and completely black, giving off a terrifying pressure.</p><p>this is the undying battleship of the undying demon nation!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The undying demon nation was another super demon nation that was on par with the eternal demon nation.</p><p>Two tigers couldn’t live on the same mountain. The two Super Devil nations were naturally hostile to each other and would often have conflicts and wars.</p><p>The immortal battleships of the immortal demon nation broke the void and came here.</p><p>A group of people stood on the deck of the warship.</p><p>The leader was a middle-aged man in a long robe. He had an overbearing aura.</p><p>“If you’re not dead, what are you doing here?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor looked at the burly man and said coldly.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>In the immortal demon nation, there was only one person who dared to use this title, and that was the ruler of the immortal demon nation, the immortal Emperor.</p><p>Just like the ancient Emperor, every king of the undying demon nation used the title of undying Emperor.</p><p>haha! Ancient One, it wasn’t easy for you to overcome your tribulation. Naturally, I’m here to congratulate you. Why? am I not welcome here? ”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed.</p><p>“You’re a guest, come down and sit!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor said before ordering his men to prepare a seat.</p><p>“Let’s go down!”</p><p>The undying Emperor said. Many people followed him and jumped off the warship.</p><p>There were experts from both the older and younger generations following him.</p><p>Undying Emperor looked around, especially at the young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>At this moment, the top 30 heaven’s favorites were still standing in the fighting ring.</p><p>The top three would be able to make a request to the ancient Emperor. The top ten would be handsomely rewarded, and the top thirty would be handsomely rewarded as well. That was why they had been waiting there.</p><p>the eternal devil nation is indeed full of geniuses. The geniuses are as common as the clouds. Even the good-for-nothing brats of My Immortal devil nation are tempted by this. They’d like to have a spar with the geniuses of the eternal devil nation. What do you think, Ancient One?”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed.</p><p>It’s here!</p><p>Many people were moved. The people of the immortal demon nation didn’t come with good intentions. They didn’t come just to congratulate the ancient Emperor.</p><p>alright, I have the same idea. It’ll be good for them if the two geniuses spar!</p><p>The ancient Emperor said.</p><p>He couldn’t reject them. Otherwise, if word got out, everyone would think that the eternal demon nation was afraid of the immortal demon nation.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed and looked at the young men behind him. have some fun with the geniuses of the eternal devil nation. Remember, don’t embarrass your Emperor!</p><p>“Yes, great emperor!”</p><p>Those heaven’s favorites cupped their fists.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Following that, a young man from the undying demon Kingdom leaped onto the battle stage. With a cold and arrogant look on his face, he scanned the geniuses from the eternal demon Kingdom and said,” my name is Yuan tuo, and 1 have a King physique. I have just broken through to the perfection of the absolute Saint realm. Who wants to fight me? ”</p><p>The geniuses of the eternal devil nation fell silent. Many of them looked around, but no one dared to step forward.</p><p>The undying demon nation obviously didn’t come with good intentions. The heaven’s pride experts they sent out wouldn’t be weak.</p><p>They didn’t know the other party’s strength and didn’t dare to make a move rashly. If they were no match, it would be a huge loss of face.</p><p>They both wanted someone else to make the first move and test each other’s strength..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
