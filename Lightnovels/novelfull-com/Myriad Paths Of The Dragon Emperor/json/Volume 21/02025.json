However, the closer he was to perfection, the harder it would be to improve.</p><p>Many people’s nomological laws stopped at ninety-nine percent maturity for hundreds, thousands, and even tens of thousands of years.</p><p>Even the stellar River had stopped for a long time.</p><p>If he wanted to break through, he needed to accumulate experience. When his comprehension of the laws was sufficient, it would naturally come to fruition.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when Ji Peng brought a few people into the Grand princess’s residence with a gloomy expression. They were walking towards Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>Ji Peng’s status was no small matter, so naturally, no one stopped him.</p><p>When they arrived at Lu Ming’s residence, Ji Peng kicked the door open and walked in with a dark expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>Ji Peng coldly shouted.</p><p>In the room, Lu Ming, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. There was a sharp glint in his eyes.</p><p>Unhurriedly, Lu Ming walked out of the room and saw Ji Peng looking at him coldly.</p><p>More than ten days ago, Lu Ming had sent him flying with a palm strike in public, causing him to Twitch on the ground and lose face. During this period of time, he had been brooding over it and wanted to find a chance to take revenge.</p><p>Later on, when he heard that Lu Ming had become the eldest princess’s guest elder, he was even more furious. After holding it in for a few days, he finally could not help but bring Lu Ming here.</p><p>brat, 1 know what you’re trying to do. You want to become the princess’s guest elder and get close to her. You’ve got a good plan. Now, I’ll give you a chance to get out of the princess’s Manor!</p><p>Ji Peng coldly spoke.</p><p>“The eldest Princess sent you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“There’s no need for the eldest Princess to instruct us on this matter!” Ji Peng said.</p><p>“I’m the eldest princess’s foreign dignitary, not yours. Since the eldest Princess didn’t say anything, then Who Do You Think You Are? what right do you have to make me leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>These words made Ji Peng’s face even gloomier.</p><p>“Brat, you’d better get out by yourself. Otherwise, I’ll break your four limbs and throw you out!”</p><p>Ji Peng said coldly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out the word coldly. He had already lost his patience.</p><p>“Brat, what’s with your attitude? how dare you talk to the second young master like that? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>A burly man beside Ji Peng rushed over and threw a punch at Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>This was to cripple Lu Ming’s cultivation!</p><p>This brawny man was in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. He punched out, and the terrifying fist force made the space howl.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the chaos law and transformed it into the demonic lightning law. Lightning swam around his body as if he was wearing a lightning armor.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he threw a punch at the burly man.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>The lightning spread and instantly destroyed the opponent’s attack. The black Lightning covered the opponent’s body, causing him to tremble and retreat.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and slapped the burly man. The burly man flew backward and fell to the ground, his body twitching non-stop.</p><p>Ji Peng and the others ‘eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger than they had imagined. A perfected absolute Saint had been defeated in two moves. Even Ji Peng might not be able to do it himself.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Ji Peng let out a furious roar. His body was like a ROC spreading its wings as he flew towards Lu Ming. With a shake of his arms, his arms emitted a mysterious light. They were like the wings of a ROC, but also like two heavenly blades. Two rays of light burst out and shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This was his divine power Technique. When he exchanged blows with Lu Ming previously, he did not use his divine power Technique.</p><p>At the same time, the remaining two people also moved.</p><p>The two of them were also in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. They used their divine abilities to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>He was ruthless and merciless. If Lu Ming was no match for him, he would be killed.</p><p>“You’re pushing it!”</p><p>The cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified. He condensed a long spear in his hand, which was covered with a layer of Black Lightning.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>He stabbed three times in a row!</p><p>There were three consecutive explosions. The attacks of Ji Peng and the other two were all blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a bolt of lightning. In a flash, he appeared in front of an elder in the absolute saint’s perfection. The lightning Spear stabbed out at an astonishing speed. It pierced the elder’s dantian and shattered his Saint heart.</p><p>The man wailed in pain as his body flew out and fell to the ground, screaming in pain.</p><p>This person’s cultivation had already been crippled by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming moved again and appeared in front of the remaining absolute Saint. He thrust his spear again and crippled his cultivation.</p><p>After two people were crippled in a row, Ji Peng was so scared that his liver and guts were torn apart. He quickly retreated, wanting to escape, but he didn’t dare to fight.</p><p>However, with a flash of lightning, Lu Ming caught up to Ji Peng.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had transformed the chaos law into the demonic lightning law, its power had been greatly reduced.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s spirit body and his Saint energy were far above Ji Peng’S. Ji Peng was not his match at all.</p><p>Although he tried his best, he was still crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming broke one of Ji Peng’s arms with a palm strike and then broke one of his legs with a kick.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>After a few consecutive explosions, Ji Peng’s four limbs were broken by Lu Ming. He lay on the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked Ji Peng and a few of his subordinates a few times, sending them flying out of the courtyard.</p><p>After all, this was the youluo devil Kingdom and the eldest princess’s residence. He couldn’t kill Ji Peng. If he did, he could only run away.</p><p>This was not Lu Ming’s goal. He still needed the eldest Princess to introduce him to the royal family of the eternal demon nation.</p><p>“Kid, just you wait!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s sinister voice came from outside the courtyard.</p><p>He had said that he would break Lu Ming’s limbs and throw him out. In the end, his limbs were broken and he was thrown out like a dead dog. This made him furious.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. If the other party went too far, he would not mind killing him and leaving the youluo demonic kingdom. He would think of other ways.</p><p>The next morning, a group of people arrived at the eldest princess’s Manor and met with her directly.</p><p>Ji Peng was in the crowd!</p><p>However, Ji Peng wasn’t the leader of this group of people. His big brother, one of his uncles, had personally led his men here.</p><p>“General Ji, brother Ji, please sit!”</p><p>In a large hall, the eldest Princess received Ji Peng and the others. However, her gaze was only fixed on the middle-aged man in the lead and a young man with a cold expression.</p><p>This middle-aged man was Ji Peng’s uncle. He was the younger brother of the youluo devil Kingdom’s Grand Marshal and also a devil general of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>The young man was Ji Peng’s elder brother, a top genius of the youluo demonic kingdom with a terrifying King body.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, we came here to ask for a person from you!”</p><p>Uncle Ji Peng said.</p><p>“You want to be alone? Who is it?”</p><p>The eldest Princess was slightly taken aback and frowned.</p><p>If the Ji family wanted someone, why did they have to come to her?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
