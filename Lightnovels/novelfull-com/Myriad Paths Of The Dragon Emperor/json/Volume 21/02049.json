He was only one step away from becoming an Emperor-to-be, similar to GE long.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming had to borrow the vast energy of the third bloodline to be a match for the eternal Star River.</p><p>However, a long time had passed and Lu Ming was no longer the same as before.</p><p>At that time, his cultivation had only been in the upper-tier of the absolute Saint realm. Now, he was already at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. He was only one step away from the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>And now, be it the primal Chaos tribulation finger or his mastery of the array Dao laws, he had improved greatly.</p><p>Furthermore, the chaos laws and array Dao laws could already be integrated. Lu Ming’s combat strength was much stronger than when he fought the eternal Star River in the lotus flower world.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could suppress the Galaxy without using the power of the third bloodline. Of course, that was under the condition that he had not broken through to the Galaxy.</p><p>The battle was still ongoing!</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the chaos laws and the array Dao laws. The combination of them was not weaker than his opponent.</p><p>The array Dao law condensed the attack of Nine Dragons, which had the power of destruction and seal, especially the seal. Although it was torn apart by the ancient Devil’s power every time, it would still interfere with him a little.</p><p>Then, he used the finger of chaos as his main attack. Although the ancient fiend was strong, it was blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged dozens of moves in a row, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Destruction. Primal Chaos tribulation finger!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly used destruction. Primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>Countless runes filled the primal Chaos tribulation finger, but they were covered by the light of Primal Chaos. If one didn’t pay attention, one wouldn’t be able to see them.</p><p>Ancient devil thought this was the same as the chaos finger, so he gathered devil light and slashed at it.</p><p>However, when he struck the finger of tribulation, his expression changed.</p><p>This was because the power of the chaos finger of tribulation had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>&Nbsp;” die! he roared, demonic light bursting from his body to block the power of the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>However, he was still a step too late.</p><p>The terrifying power surged and sent ancient devil flying.</p><p>Ancient devil retreated a few thousand meters and blood trickled down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>The ancient devil took a closer look at Lu Ming and said. Then, he stepped back and flew to the warship in the sky.</p><p>“I was lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He had used a trick earlier. The ancient devil was injured by him due to its carelessness.</p><p>If he was on guard, Lu Ming might not be able to defeat the ancient demon even if he had the upper hand.</p><p>He won!</p><p>Lu Ming had won!</p><p>The people from the ancient devil nation were ecstatic.</p><p>It was really a ray of light at the end of the tunnel!</p><p>Before, they had been completely suppressed by the undying demon nation. Even the two sons of God had been defeated by ancient devil, which was a great loss of face.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to appear at the critical moment and defeat the ancient devil in one fell swoop.</p><p>There was no doubt that the ancient devil was the number one genius of the immortal demon nation. If even the ancient devil was defeated, no one in the immortal demon nation would be a match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>In the eternal devil nation, someone laughed out loud, feeling as though he had finally gotten his revenge.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>Luo Xuan muttered as his eyes glowed with a strange light.</p><p>On the other hand, the faces of the people from the undying demon nation were a little gloomy.</p><p>This time around, they had come prepared. They wanted to use the time when the ancient Emperor was celebrating his victory to make use of the younger generation to humiliate the ancient demon nation and make the ancient Emperor lose face.</p><p>Everything had been going according to their plan and they had successfully defeated the geniuses from the eternal devil nation. However, who would have thought that Lu Ming would suddenly appear and turn the tables?</p><p>If Lu Ming continued to challenge them, would he not be able to defeat them?</p><p>The one who regretted it the most was Yuan tuo. He wanted to slap himself.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming did not make a move. He was the one who challenged Lu Ming first. He did not expect that he would provoke a fiend.</p><p>the ancient devil nation is indeed full of talents. It’s a pity that someone is blind. How could such a genius be nameless? what a joke!</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed and returned to the battleship.</p><p>Then, the other members of the immortal demon nation also returned to the battleship.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The battleship started up, broke through the void, and disappeared.</p><p>The people of the immortal demon Kingdom had left, but the Azure Demon King and Cang Yan’s faces were extremely unsightly.</p><p>Undying Emperor’s words were like a slap to their faces.</p><p>he’s finally gone. This time, it’s all thanks to Lu Ming. Otherwise, we’d really be humiliated by the immortal demon nation!</p><p>that’s right. The undying demon nation has a heaven’s favorite who cultivates the ancient demon path. How amazing!</p><p>“No matter how amazing it is, it was still defeated by Lu Ming!”</p><p>someone actually said that Lu Ming is not qualified to participate in the competition. What a joke!</p><p>After the immortal demon nation’s people left, the crowd discussed animatedly, and some even sneered at them.</p><p>A prodigy like Lu Ming was actually stopped and not allowed to participate in the competition.</p><p>If Lu Ming was not qualified, who was?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King roared in his heart, wishing he could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>As for Cang Yan, his face was so dark that it seemed as if water was about to drip out.</p><p>The ancient Emperor glanced at the ashen Demon King with dissatisfaction, then turned to Lu Ming with a smile.”Lu Ming, 1 heard that you’re from the youluo demonic kingdom?”</p><p>Naturally, the eternal demon Emperor had heard the discussions of the others.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>well, good. I didn’t expect there to be such a heaven’s favorite in the youluo demonic kingdom. He’s at the peak of the ultimate Saint realm and defeated the heaven’s favorite of the ancient demonic Dao. It’s a rare sight. I hereby announce that the ranking of this competition will be rearranged. You will be first, and the others will move back one place!</p><p>The ancient Emperor announced.</p><p>Cang Yan’s expression changed greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming won first place, and the people behind him fell back one place.</p><p>Originally, Cang Yan could have made a request to the great emperor if he had gotten third place, but now that he had become fourth, he had no right to make a request.</p><p>Cang Yan almost vomited blood. He had already thought of what conditions he would ask for, which would be of great use to him, but now, all of that was for nothing.</p><p>“It’s all Lu Ming’s fault!”</p><p>Cang Yan was filled with hatred.</p><p>In his opinion, why did Lu Ming have to attack and defeat the ancient devil? it was all Lu Ming’s fault!</p><p>As for whether he would be humiliated by the immortal demon nation, what did it have to do with him? How could it compare to the importance of his request to the great emperor?</p><p>“Do you guys have any objections?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s gaze swept across the entire place, stopping on the faces of Cang Demon King and Cang Yan.</p><p>They had a hundred or a thousand complaints in their hearts, but they didn’t dare to say it out loud.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had defeated the ancient devil and restored the reputation of the ancient devil nation. The ancient Emperor was very satisfied with Lu Ming.</p><p>They could only smile against their will and say that they had no objections.</p><p>alright, since that’s the case, Lu Ming will take first place. According to my promise, the top three can make a request of me. Lu Ming, whatever request you have, feel free to make it!</p><p>The ancient Emperor said to Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
