Waves of powerful aura pressed down on Luo Xuan.</p><p>A month ago, her cultivation had still been at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. However, recently, she had broken through to the perfected absolute Saint realm. With this cultivation, she truly stood at the peak of the youluo demonic kingdom.</p><p>Ji Tian used to be known as the number one prodigy of the youluo demonic kingdom, and his cultivation was only in the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>“Do you think you’ve won for sure?”</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xuan’s voice was heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Luo Xuan’s body also burst out with a powerful aura.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s cultivation had been at the pinnacle of an absolute Saint before, but now, he had reached the perfected absolute Saint realm.</p><p>You ning’s expression suddenly changed as he exclaimed,” “Your cultivation has also broken through!”</p><p>of course. Do you think you’re the only one who has broken through? ”</p><p>Luo Xuan chuckled.</p><p>“So what if you’ve broken through? 1’11 still defeat you!”</p><p>You ning said coldly as he charged towards Luo Xuan.</p><p>The two princesses started to fight again.</p><p>Both of them had King bodies and could control the king path laws. Their cultivation had reached the absolute Saint perfection, and their battle was extremely shocking. Ordinary emperors-to-be weren’t their match.</p><p>On the fighting ring, only two shadows could be seen clashing continuously. Some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t even see clearly.</p><p>“It seems that no one can gain the upper hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming paid close attention to the battle on the fighting ring. He realized that you ning and Luo Xuan had the same cultivation and combat strength. Moreover, the two of them seemed to know each other very well. They were in a stalemate and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, the two of them had already exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>The two of them had been fighting for a long time, and they were both emitting white smoke. They had circulated their Saint energy to the maximum and exchanged a few blows, but there was still no clear winner.</p><p>Their breathing started to get heavier and slower.</p><p>This was a sign of extreme exhaustion.</p><p>However, the two of them were very persistent. Neither of them wanted to lose to the other, so they gritted their teeth and continued to fight.</p><p>In the end, the two of them started to move slower and slower, as if they were in slow motion.</p><p>“Brother Luo, it’s not good for them to continue fighting. Why don’t we tie this battle?”</p><p>The you family head, who was also the current king of the you Luo devil Kingdom, looked at the Luo family head.</p><p>“Alright, this round is considered a draw!”</p><p>The head of the Luo family nodded.</p><p>If they continued to fight, both sides would only suffer losses. If they overexerted themselves, it would not be good for the two.</p><p>The Masters of the Luo and you families nodded. The doyen of the youluo devil Kingdom moved and appeared in front of you ning and Luo Xuan, blocking them.</p><p>this round is considered a draw. You can go back and rest!</p><p>The elder said.</p><p>You ning and Luo Xuan glared at each other unwillingly and snorted coldly. Then, they returned to the stands and swallowed the pills. They watched the rest of the competition while refining the pills.</p><p>In the next battle, it was another King physique from the Luo clan’s side who easily defeated his opponent.</p><p>“You family’s number 3 versus Luo family’s number 31!”</p><p>After the Luo family’s King physique went into battle, the doyen reported the number.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. It was his turn.</p><p>also, isn’t number three of the you family Huang Song?</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, a cold smile on his lips.</p><p>The eyes of Luo Xuan, Wu Xi, and the others also lit up.</p><p>Others might not know, but they knew that Lu Ming had a King body. He had easily defeated Wu Xi back then, and his combat strength was definitely above Huang song’s.</p><p>“I will take revenge for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted Wu Xi’s shoulder and stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve finally met this kid!”</p><p>Huang Song was overjoyed. His expression was extremely sinister and excited.</p><p>Since Princess you ning wanted to kill Lu Ming, he naturally had to get rid of Lu Ming on her behalf.</p><p>Huang Song, don’t kill him so easily. It’s best to let him beg for mercy miserably on the fighting stage before killing him!</p><p>Ji Peng said to Huang Song as he glared at Lu Ming viciously.</p><p>“Haha, that’s just what I want!”</p><p>Huang Song laughed and rushed up the fighting ring. He glared at Lu Ming with a ferocious look and said,”Kid, kneel down and beg for mercy. 1 might let you die a quick death!”</p><p>He thought that he would see a look of fear on Lu Ming’s face. However, he was disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be smiling yet not smiling. He looked at Huang Song and said two words,” How lamentable!</p><p>“What did you say, kid?” Huang song’s face turned gloomy.</p><p>“I say, you’re about to reach the end of your life, but you don’t know it. How sad!”</p><p>Lu Ming added.</p><p>hahaha, kid, you’re saying that you can kill me? I’d like to see where your confidence comes from!</p><p>die! Huang Song hollered. As soon as he finished speaking, his figure charged towards Lu Ming. His claws were like knives as he grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>On Huang song’s hands, he was also wearing a type of glove. This glove was like mercury, wrapping around his palm and could change at will. His fingertips were extremely sharp.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>Black Lightning flickered on Lu Ming’s palm as he threw a palm strike at Huang Song.</p><p>you’re only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, yet you dare to fight Huang Song head-on. You’re really looking for death!</p><p>Huang song’s spiritual body is extremely powerful. Even an expert in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm wouldn’t dare to face Huang Song head-on. This brat doesn’t know what’s good for him!</p><p>it looks like Huang Song wants to kill him. He’s finished!</p><p>The moment Lu Ming made his move, he attracted a wave of discussion.</p><p>However, the next moment, all the sounds disappeared at once. This was because Lu Ming and Huang Song had already collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A figure wailed and flew far away, falling to the ground.</p><p>It was not Lu Ming as everyone had imagined, but Huang Song.</p><p>Huang Song was sent flying a hundred meters and fell to the ground. His entire body twitched non-stop, and his entire body was covered in lightning.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming did not move.</p><p>‘This …’ How was that possible?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at the peak of an absolute Saint. How could he have sent Huang Song flying with one move?</p><p>Lu Ming did not have the king physique!</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>On the grandstand, Ji Peng roared, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong and he could defeat him, they did not think that Lu Ming could defeat Huang Song.</p><p>Other than the king physique, Huang Song was almost invincible in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Moreover, Huang song’s cultivation was even higher.</p><p>You ning’s expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Even Luo Xuan, Wu Xi, and the others were shocked.</p><p>Although they had guessed that Lu Ming would be able to defeat Huang Song, the prerequisite was that Lu Ming had to use the king path law. However, Lu Ming had not used the king path law at all and he had defeated Huang Song. This was beyond their expectations.</p><p>Of course, they did not know that Lu Ming’s spirit body was far superior to an ordinary high-class heaven spirit body. Moreover, he had cultivated two Saint hearts and his Saint energy was far superior to those of the same level. It was not inferior to those in the absolute Saint perfection. He could easily defeat Huang Song even without using the king path law.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and neared Huang Song. He looked down at the other party and said,” “Didn’t you want to kill me? come!”</p><p>Huang Song looked at Lu Ming. His expression was no longer malevolent. Instead, it was filled with fear.</p><p>He roared and rushed out of the fighting ring.</p><p>He wanted to rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat. Lu Ming would not let him do as he wished.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a bolt of lightning. In a flash, he appeared in front of Huang Song. The lightning in his hand flashed and condensed into a long Lightning Spear, which he thrust at Huang Song..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
