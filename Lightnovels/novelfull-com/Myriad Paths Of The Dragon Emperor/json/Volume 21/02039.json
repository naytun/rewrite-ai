His fingers were like a spear, constantly pointing out. With the support of the law of penetration, the power was terrifyingly strong and could penetrate everything.</p><p>The Spear’s gleam was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did the same. Countless runes filled the air and condensed into lightning birds. They pounced at the spear lights at an astonishing speed and blocked them.</p><p>“So strong, so this person also has a King physique!”</p><p>no wonder she can sit side by side with Princess Luo Xuan!</p><p>Some of the heaven’s favorites from the smaller countries exclaimed.</p><p>“Two moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently in the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Cang Yan used his third attack, and his cultivation in the absolute Saint great circle was unleashed.</p><p>An even more terrifying finger force was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Cang Yan’s attack method was very similar to Luo pokong’s, but the magical technique they used was different.</p><p>However, Cang Yan’s battle strength was much stronger than Luo pokong’s.</p><p>A terrifying force whizzed towards Lu Ming, but it was still blocked by Lu Ming’s finger.</p><p>“Three moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak calmly and nonchalantly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Cang Yan’s eyes became colder and colder.</p><p>A ring of light emerged from his body and surrounded him.</p><p>The light of law!</p><p>Many people took in a deep breath. Cang Yan’s battle prowess was indeed terrifying. As the top genius of the eternal devil nation, he was able to suppress the other King physiques.</p><p>It was said that in the entire eternal demon nation, apart from the Son of God, no one was a match for Cang Yan.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A spear appeared in Cang Yan’s hand, and when combined with the light of law, its power reached a shocking level.</p><p>“Three scrolls in one!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed a finger, and a true dragon roared and pounced at Cang Yan.</p><p>This true dragon contained the annihilation scroll, illusionary spirit scroll, and sealing scroll. The three scrolls were combined into one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the spear in Cang Yan’s hand trembled as his body trembled violently. He was forced to retreat by a terrifying force.</p><p>Cang Yan was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>Below, other than the people from the youluo devil Kingdom, everyone else was dumbfounded. Some of them even rubbed their eyes, thinking that they were seeing things.</p><p>Cang Yan suppressed the other King physiques and stood at the peak. As long as the Son of Heaven didn’t appear, he was almost invincible.</p><p>But now, he was at a disadvantage because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Who was this Lu Ming? How could a random person be so terrifying? they were speechless.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength? You wanted to defeat me in ten moves? what a joke, now it’s my turn!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said indifferently as he stepped forward. Countless runes soared into the sky and turned into Nine Dragons.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a real Dragon, but Nine Dragons.</p><p>The nine Dragons flew towards Cang Yan.</p><p>To be honest, Cang Yan was very strong, even stronger than Ji Tian.</p><p>Cang Yan was almost at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, and his nomological laws had reached 99%. He was only one step away from the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>However, compared to Lu Ming, even if Lu Ming did not use the law of chaos, he was still lacking.</p><p>As the nine Dragons pounced out, Cang Yan’s expression changed drastically, and he stabbed out with his spear with all his strength.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and continuously struck out with their claws, destroying Cang Yan’s attack. The terrifying destructive power and countless symbols surged towards Cang Yan.</p><p>Cang Yan’s figure madly retreated, continuously retreating 10000 meters before regaining his balance.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. His voice was not loud, but it was like a heavy blow that hit Cang Yan, causing him to spit out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s short three words were filled with sarcasm.</p><p>Just a moment ago, Cang Yan was still insufferably arrogant and said that he would defeat Lu Ming in ten moves.</p><p>In fact, he had only casually mentioned ten moves. In his opinion, one move would be enough to defeat or even kill Lu Ming.</p><p>But now, in less than ten moves, he was the one who lost to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Cang Yan roared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>From the depths of the palace, two figures rushed out. Their terrifying auras bloomed, causing everyone’s faces to change.</p><p>They were two martial sovereigns!</p><p>Cang Yan was going to send out a martial Supreme to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cang Yan, you’re going back on your word!”</p><p>Luo Xuan soared into the sky and arrived in front of Lu Ming, glaring at Cang Yan.</p><p>“Move!” He shouted.</p><p>Cang Yan’s expression was a little sinister. Today, in front of so many people from small countries, Lu Ming had made him lose face. He wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>As for all of this, he had asked for it, but he would not consider it.</p><p>It was all Lu Ming’s fault. How could it be his?</p><p>Cang Yan, you can’t win, so you sent out a martial sovereign. If this matter gets out, I’m afraid it’ll be a disgrace to your reputation. Even the reputation of the Azure Demon King Palace will be affected!</p><p>Luo Xuan stood firmly in front of Lu Ming and continued,” moreover, even if you must make a move today, you’ll have to do it over my dead body. Lu Ming is my guest elder. I can’t just watch him be killed!</p><p>Cang Yan’s expression became even uglier.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s words had indeed caused him to be apprehensive.</p><p>One was his reputation, and the other was Luo Xuan’s identity.</p><p>Luo Xuan was the princess of the youluo devil Kingdom. The youluo devil Kingdom was not an ordinary small Kingdom. It was one of the top five upper-class devil kingdoms under the eternal devil Kingdom. As such, he was very apprehensive.</p><p>Cang Yan hesitated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Luo Xuan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, then turned around and left the Azure Demon King’s residence. Wu Xi and the others followed him quickly.</p><p>Cang Yan’s expression changed a few times, but in the end, he didn’t give the order to attack.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest left the ashen Demon King’s residence and returned to their residence.</p><p>I didn’t expect that person to be from the vicissitude house!</p><p>Lu Ming was also quite speechless.</p><p>Initially, he had wanted to get to know the imperial family of the eternal devil nation through Luo Xuan’s recommendation. Who would have thought that he would offend the young prince of the Azure Demon King’s residence the moment he arrived?</p><p>it seems like I can only wait for the banquet of the king of the eternal devil nation. I’ll have to find an opportunity when all the geniuses are sparring!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming, there’s no need to think too much. The ashen demon Palace isn’t the only Paragon of the imperial family in the eternal demon nation. I’ll introduce you to the others in a few days!</p><p>Luo Xuan comforted Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Luo Xuan and smiled.</p><p>Luo Xuan’s unwavering determination to stand in front of him had touched him.</p><p>Luo Xuan was a genuine person, and he was much stronger than you ning.</p><p>Over the next few days, Luo Xuan introduced a few royal family members to Lu Ming. However, although they were quite talented, they were still lacking compared to Cang Yan.</p><p>There were a few times when Lu Ming tried to find out more about the eternal demonic coffin. However, the other party did not know much about it. He only knew that it was the treasure of the eternal demonic nation and that only the King could control it.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was troubled.</p><p>The ancient demon coffin was so important that only the King could control it. Could he really borrow it for a month?</p><p>The king of the ancient devil nation was an Emperor.</p><p>Such a person was high and mighty, even higher than the average great emperor.. Why would he care about him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
