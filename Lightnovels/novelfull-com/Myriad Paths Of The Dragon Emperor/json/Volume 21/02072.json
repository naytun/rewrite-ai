Qiu Yue had been unconscious all this while and her soul was incomplete. He did not expect her to be able to refine the light of law. This was really unbelievable.</p><p>However, this did not stop. Qiu Yue’s aura was still rising.</p><p>The aura of the laws of yin and yang emanated from her body.</p><p>Suddenly, the laws of yin and yang converged into a long river and swam around Qiu Yue’s body. Her aura rose again.</p><p>laws forming a River, Emperor-to-be!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Qiu Yue had been unconscious for a while, but she had broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Indeed, during this period of time, Lu Ming had condensed a huge amount of sacred elixirs into Qiu Yue’s body. However, the laws could not be improved just by consuming sacred elixirs. They needed to be understood.</p><p>Qiu Yue was unconscious, so how could she comprehend laws?</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled.</p><p>When her aura reached Emperor-to-be, it finally calmed down. At this time, Qiu Yue opened her eyes.</p><p>Two rays of light shot out from Qiu Yue’s eyes. In the next moment, they were retracted.</p><p>Then, Qiu Yue’s aura was retracted.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>When Qiu Yue saw Lu Ming, she cheered and pounced into his arms.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you’re finally awake!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched Qiu Yue’s head and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>He finally felt a little better.</p><p>“En, young master, are you alright? those people wanted to kill you back then</p><p>11</p><p>Qiu Yue looked around nervously. Her memory was still stuck in the Lotus World.</p><p>“It’s alright, it’s been a long time!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“A long time has passed?”</p><p>Qiu Yue was suspicious and blinked her big eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly recounted what had happened during this period of time.</p><p>Of course, there were some things that he directly skipped, such as Xie nianqing.</p><p>“It’s been so long? Have I been unconscious all this time? Strange, I’ve been feeling like I’m in a strange state, being wrapped by the laws of yin and yang. I’ve been in a daze, but suddenly, a warm force wrapped around me from behind!”</p><p>Qiu Yue began.</p><p>“Could it be a soul enlightenment?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>When it came to enlightenment, it was a rare state of cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that after Qiu Yue’s soul was injured, she had entered a state of enlightenment. This state was extremely rare and she would unconsciously continue to comprehend the Dao and the laws.</p><p>Her body had been tempered by the alchemy fire in the Dayan elixir furnace and smelted countless sacred herbs. That was why her cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds after she woke up. Not only had she refined the light of law, but she had also broken through to the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>Or perhaps, the ancient demonic coffin had also played a role.</p><p>Truly, fortune and misfortune come together, and the world is unpredictable.</p><p>Lu Ming was happy for Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Qiuyue, your current cultivation has already surpassed young master’s!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“But I’m sure that Qiu Yue is no match for young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue stuck out her tongue, tugged at Lu Ming, and talked non-stop.</p><p>In the following days, the two of them cultivated while challenging the levels.</p><p>This place was very mysterious. When Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were walking together, they would see six middle-aged men in front of them, causing Lu Ming to retreat in shock.</p><p>Although Qiu Yue had reached the Emperor-to-be realm, she couldn’t even fight one middle-aged man, let alone three. It was obviously impossible for two of them to break through the pass together.</p><p>Therefore, Qiu Yue would enter the mountain and river diagram every time they tried to pass through the levels. This way, there would only be three middle-aged strong men.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the death law became higher and higher.</p><p>Another month had passed. Lu Ming had been in the canyon for four months.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mastery of the death precept had reached fifty percent.</p><p>When combined with other laws, Lu Ming was already on par with the three middle-aged men. He could even suppress them.</p><p>Fighting with these middle-aged men had improved Lu Ming’s speed.</p><p>Here, one could kill to their heart’s content without any apprehension. Every time, Lu Ming would unleash his combat strength to the extreme and continuously squeeze out his potential.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming would occasionally let Qiu Yue go forward to challenge the levels. Lu Ming did his best to deal with five middle-aged men, while Qiu Yue dealt with one.</p><p>This way, Qiu Yue’s improvement would be huge.</p><p>Time flew by quickly, and another month passed. The two of them had quite a bit of harvest every day.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, cultivating with his eyes closed.</p><p>Suddenly, endless runes appeared around his body.</p><p>Countless runes began to gather, forming a long river.</p><p>River of laws!</p><p>This was the array Dao law!</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s array Dao laws had broken through and entered the perfect realm. The laws condensed into a River.</p><p>At that moment, the power of the array Dao law coursed through Lu Ming’s body and began to temper his physical body.</p><p>Once the laws formed a River, the corresponding power of laws would once again flow through the body and use the power of laws to temper the body, making the body even stronger.</p><p>At the same time, the Saint energy would also become more condensed and dense.</p><p>This was also the reason why an Emperor-to-be expert was so much stronger than an expert in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a stir-like sound. It was the vibration of his muscles and the collision of his bones.</p><p>Qiu Yue sat cross-legged not far away, waiting quietly.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation and the river of laws disappeared without a trace.</p><p>I’m now an Emperor-to-be!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Right now, he couldn’t figure out his specific realm.</p><p>According to the Laws of Chaos, he was still in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage. However, according to the laws of array Dao, he was already an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>But no matter what, his combat strength had indeed increased by a large margin.</p><p>When the formation path law formed a River, its power increased greatly. At the same time, when the law formed a River, it tempered the body and Saint power, and both were improved.</p><p>1 wonder how much my body and Saint power will improve when the chaos laws and even the death laws form a River.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>The river formed by each law would greatly improve the physical body and Saint power.</p><p>If all of his nomological laws formed a River, how much would his combat strength increase?</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that no one was his match in a battle of the same level. He could even suppress the Son of God with a flip of his hand.</p><p>“What if I comprehend a few more nomological laws?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If he comprehended a few more nomological laws, his nomological laws would form a River, and he would be even more terrifying.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more excited Lu Ming became. He pondered what law he should comprehend next..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
