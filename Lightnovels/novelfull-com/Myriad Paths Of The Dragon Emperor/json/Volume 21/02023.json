Although Lu Ming looked very young and might not be very powerful, as long as she could hold him off for a while, she would have a chance to escape.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t have rhe strength to help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and retreated even faster, distancing himself from the stunning woman.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was not willing to help her, the beautiful woman could only grit her teeth and fly in another direction. Before she lefr, she cast a few hateful glances ar Lu Ming, as if blaming him for not helping her.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. His goal was to go to rhe eternal devil nation and he did not want to be a busybody.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the beautiful woman disappeared from their sight, and the people who were chasing behind her also quickly followed.</p><p>To Lu Ming, this was just an interlude. He continued on his way and flew toward the nearest medium-level devil Kingdom.</p><p>After spending a few more days, he finally arrived at the outskirts of the capital of this mid-sized devil Kingdom.</p><p>There was indeed a teleportation formation in this middle-rank devil Kingdom.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>A burly man in charge of rhe teleportation array asked Lu Ming.</p><p>1 want to go to the capital of the ancient devil nation!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The capital of rhe eternal devil nation? Kid, aren’t you from the land of myriad demons? We mid-tier devil nations don’t have the right ro teleport directly to the capital of rhe eternal devil nation. If you want to go there, you have to go to a high-tier devil nation and go there from there!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>There was such a rule?</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. It seemed that he could only go to the high-rank devil nation first and then head to the capital of the ancient devil nation from there.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll go to the high-rank devil nation first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the nearest high-rank devil Kingdom is the you Luo devil Kingdom. I suggest you go there first!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Alright, thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and paid the teleportation fee. He then stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming disappeared from the teleportation array and arrived at another place.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the teleportation array and asked around. He had already arrived at the youluo demonic kingdom.</p><p>This was a Citadel outside the capital of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>the youluo devil Kingdom is one of the ten high-tier devil kingdoms in the land of myriad Devils. It’s extremely powerful. Why don’t I head to the capital of the youluo devil kingdom first and find out more about the eternal devil Kingdom?</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The youluo devil Kingdom was one of the top ten high-rank devil kingdoms in the land of ten thousand Devils. There was no need ro doubt its strength.</p><p>Lu Ming could take a look at the strength of the top forces in the land of myriad demons. In this way, he could also have a judgment of the overall strength of the land of myriad demons.</p><p>Furthermore, even if he were to go ro rhe capital of rhe ancient devil nation, he would be in rhe dark and wouldn’t know where ro start.</p><p>He couldn’t just run straight to the capital of the eternal devil nation and ask for the eternal devil coffin, right? if that were the case, he would be lucky if no one killed him.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to think about it carefully.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming did not head to rhe capital of the eternal devil Kingdom. Instead, he flew to the capital of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>The capital of rhe youluo devil Kingdom was exceptionally Grand and vast.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was the city walls or the buildings inside, most of them were built with a kind of black stone, and they were filled with an overbearing aura.</p><p>Lu Ming walked on the streets of the youluo demonic kingdom and realized that there were many experts here.</p><p>Each of them exuded demonic Qi and their bodies were filled with killing intent. Lu Ming secretly sized them up and found that there were many Saint realm experts and many Emperor-to-be experts.</p><p>They could even see Martial Emperor experts giving off Emperor might walking on the streets.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that the quality and number of experts in the land of infinite demons were higher than that in rhe yuan mountain!</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold and arrogant voice was heard. At the same time, a cold aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The voice just now was obviously directed at him. However, it was his first time in the youluo demonic kingdom and he did not know anyone.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of rhe sound.</p><p>“It’s her?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Not far away, a beautiful woman in a tight-fitting purple dress was staring at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Wasn’t this lady the one who was being hunted down a few days ago and had asked Lu Ming for help? he did not expect to meet her here.</p><p>This was too much of a coincidence. Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>The young woman’s aura was very cold and it enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s her Highness, the eldest Princess!”</p><p>“Who’s that kid? He seems to have made the eldest Princess very unhappy. He’s finished!”</p><p>Around them, many people stopped to watch and started to discuss.</p><p>“The eldest Princess?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Could this person be the princess of the youluo demonic kingdom?</p><p>“Princess, is this the person who left us in the lurch?”</p><p>A young man asked. There were a few people beside rhe beautiful woman.</p><p>“That’s right, this is the person!1</p><p>The eldest Princess replied coldly.</p><p>Back then, he was being chased by the enemy and met Lu Ming on the way. He asked Lu Ming for help, but Lu Ming did not save him. Fortunately, he met with reinforcements later and escaped from danger.</p><p>He did nor expect ro meet Lu Ming in the capital of the youluo demonic kingdom!</p><p>At the thought of Lu Ming s attitude back then, a cold glint flashed in rhe eldest princess’s eyes.</p><p>“He left the eldest Princess in the lurch. Hmph, 1’11 go cripple him!”</p><p>A skinny elder behind the eldest Princess said coldly. He moved and pounced at Lu Ming. A demonic palm print blasted at Lu Ming, bringing with it gusts of strong wind.</p><p>The eldest Princess didn’t stop him, only watching indifferently.</p><p>“Ger lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and struck our a palm as well, matching the skinny elder’s palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, rhe skinny old man’s body trembled violently. His body flew back at an even faster speed, and he fell to the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming had been merciful. It was his first time here and he did not want to cause trouble. Otherwise, the other party would have been dead.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Many people were shocked. The skinny elder had rhe cultivation of an absolute Saint, bur he was injured by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>This young man s combat strength was not weak!</p><p>Many people were thinking!</p><p>“How dare you fight back! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man beside the eldest Princess shouted coldly. His gaze was as cold as a blade.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a step forward and his figure was like a Phantom as he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows, a trace of anger rising in his heart.</p><p>In the wilderness, he had met rhe eldest Princess. He was not related to the eldest Princess in any way, so why did he save her? It was his freedom to save or not to save.</p><p>But now, the other party wanted to cripple his cultivation and even kill him because of this matter. How tyrannical.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man made his move. He struck out with his palm as well. The force of his palm was like an avalanche, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This young man was very strong, many times stronger than the skinny old man.</p><p>Not only had he reached rhe pinnacle of the absolute Saint realm, but he also had a superior-class sky spiritual body.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, lie shouted and struck out with his palm as well.</p><p>In his palm, dark lightning flashed.</p><p>The palm and the other’s palm print collided, and the result was almost the same as the skinny old man’s.</p><p>The young man grunted and his body was thrown far away. He fell to the ground and his body twitched. Black Lightning was swimming around his body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
