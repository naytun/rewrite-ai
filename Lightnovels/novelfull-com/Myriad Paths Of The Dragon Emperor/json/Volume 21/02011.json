There were even true emperors and void emperors.</p><p>They released their auras and helped Lu Ming and the rest to fight against the people from the three major forces.</p><p>“A bunch of small fries who think they can change the outcome of the bartie!</p><p>Emperor tianluo said coldly.</p><p>“Wuxiang, you’ve said so much just to find a few more helpers, but what’s the use of a group of small fish? Make your move and kill Lu Ming. Kill anyone who blocks your way!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng clan spoke.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Emperor Heng’s aura exploded, and his powerful aura locked onto Emperor formless.</p><p>At that moment, rhe auras of the powerhouses from the three major forces locked onto everyone except Lu Ming.</p><p>“Whoever makes a move, lull Lu Ming!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan spoke coldly.</p><p>“I’ll kill him!”</p><p>From the he family, a middle-aged man who looked to be in his fifties stepped out. Flis terrifying aura swept towards Lu Ming like a tide.</p><p>This person was called he Qian. He was a small emperor void Emperor. He had just broken through to the small emperor realm and was a one-star void Emperor.</p><p>With such a good opportunity, he wanted to show off in front of the great emperor he. Perhaps, the great emperor he would reward him handsomely.</p><p>“Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, Luo Tianyi, and the others were shocked. The teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy, the Phoenix Palace, the divine elephant sect, and the ice curtain all changed their expressions. They wanted to attack, but they found that they had all been locked on.</p><p>The auras of the experts from the three major forces were locked on them. As long as they moved, they would be attacked by lightning. Moreover, the ones who were staring at them were al! very powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Uncle Kong moved, and his sword Qi whistled. A terrifying sword light was about to slash at he Qian.</p><p>“Old man, your opponent is me!”</p><p>Emperor tianluo shouted. The seal trembled and shot out a beam of divine light, blocking uncle Kong s sword light. Then, the seal trembled and charged toward uncle Kong.</p><p>The sword Qi whistled as the battle between uncle Kong and the Emperor of tianluo broke out. The two exchanged a few moves before rushing into the dark void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, Emperor formless and Emperor Heng exchanged a blow, and the two of them stood in confrontation from a distance.</p><p>Emperor formless couldn’t spare any time to rescue him. He was originally a bit stronger than the Heng clan’s Emperor, and he had won the last time they had fought.</p><p>However, he was still heavily injured and might be at a disadvantage against the Emperor of the Heng family.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>He Qian stepped in the air. With every step he took, the air trembled. His aura grew stronger and stronger, like a storm, pressing down on Lu Ming. He was like a giant looking down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it s your honor to die in my hands. Kill! ”</p><p>He Qian’s palm was like a knife as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A white blade light filled with coldness caused the temperature to drop sharply.</p><p>“Fight!11</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and took a step forward. The aura in his body surged wildly, and all the Saint power in his body gathered at the tip of his finger. Then, he pointed.</p><p>The energy between heaven and earth gathered at Lu Ming’s fingertips in a frenzy. Then, a finger force that had been condensed to the extreme burst out and collided with He Yan’s Saber Light.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>A sharp collision sound rang out, and the force rolled in all directions. He Qian’s Saber Light actually shattered and turned into nothing.</p><p>It was blocked!</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but widen their eyes.</p><p>The Martial Emperor s attack was actually blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that Lu Ming did not even take a step back after blocking the other party’s attack.</p><p>Such terrifying combat strength, many people exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>He Qian’s eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>Although he did not use his full strength in the previous move, Lu Ming was unscathed after that move. He did not even retreat. He felt that he had lost face.</p><p>Moreover, he glanced around and found that the patriarch of the he family looked gloomy. His heart sank immediately.</p><p>Could it be that the great emperor of the he clan had a bad impression of him?</p><p>damn it! It’s all Lu Ming’s fault! I’m going to tear him into pieces!</p><p>He Qian roared in his heart, his eyes revealing an ice-cold lulling intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! he Qian shouted as the Martial Emperor’s world Energy circulated wildly. His palm turned into a dazzling Saber Light and slashed out with a howl, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes narrowed slightly. He moved his body, advancing instead of retreating, and rushed towards he Qian.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch and pieces of illusionary prison-suppressing steles appeared, clashing with he Qian’s Saber Light.</p><p>The shadow of the prison-suppressing stele shattered, but the blade light was also blocked.</p><p>“The Long Song of the Four Seasons! ”</p><p>After failing to take down Lu Ming in a few consecutive moves, he Qian was a little anxious and used the he family’s divine skill, the song of the Four Seasons!</p><p>The momentum of his saber instantly changed.</p><p>At first, it was like the snow of winter, then it turned into the thick feeling of spring, and in the next moment, it was like the scorching sun in the sky, unbearably hot.</p><p>The saber’s momentum changed and its power increased greatly, it shattered the prison-suppressing stele that Lu Ming had condensed in the void and the saber Light continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated continuously!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, he Qian’s saber momentum became even fiercer and swept toward Lu Ming frantically.</p><p>Chi Chi…</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming cast the chaos finger of tribulation. He pointed several times with his right hand and the force of his fingers collided with he Qian s saber radiance. Countless runes appeared on Lu Ming’s left hand.</p><p>A true dragon roared and pounced toward he Qian.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>attack! he Qian shouted. A blade light burst our and destroyed the true dragon. However, the true dragon turned into countless runes and spread towards he Qian, trying to seal him.</p><p>The combined power of three of the nine scrolls of array Dao was indeed very profound.</p><p>He Qian’s expression changed slightly, and the power of the world burst forth, shattering the endless runes.</p><p>Next, the two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>He Qian was indeed very powerful. Although he had broken through to the void Emperor realm not long ago, he was still a Martial Emperor after all. His combat strength far exceeded that of an Emperor-to-be. Every move contained the power of the world and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming relied on the use of two types of laws and barely managed to block it.</p><p>But even so, everyone was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was only an absolute Saint, He had not even reached the perfection of the absolute Saint realm. He was only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, but he could fight with a Martial Emperor and even block him. This was too shocking.</p><p>Many powerhouses of the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect were all shocked.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, what kind of combat strength would he have when he broke through to the void Emperor realm or even the true Emperor realm?</p><p>What if he broke through to the great emperor realm?</p><p>When they thought of this, their hearts were filled with a chill.</p><p>Even the eyes of the emperors from the he family, the Heng family, and the tianluo heavenly Emperor were filled with coldness.</p><p>The more talented Lu Ming was, the more he deserved to die.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Since the start of the battle, he Qian had not managed to take down Lu Ming. He was getting more and more impatient.</p><p>initially, he would not have done this given his character. The main reason was that he could not accept the fact that he could not take down Lu Ming after so many moves despite being a Martial Emperor.</p><p>His saber momentum became fiercer and fiercer, and he could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“Destruction. Primal Chaos tribulation finger!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly pointed his finger.</p><p>This finger was Lu Ming’s strongest killing move. It was the initial fusion of the array Dao laws and the chaos laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
