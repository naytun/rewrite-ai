However, some cultivation places had not been restored yet.</p><p>Right now, there were very few geniuses left in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. The majority of them had already returned to their respective powers.</p><p>Only a small number of geniuses and the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy were still present.</p><p>Of course, due to the evil god tribe’s remnants that had been wiped out in the heavenly Emperor City, many powerful forces and experts were temporarily staying in the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>For example, there were some experts from the Phoenix Palace and the divine elephant sect who were temporarily staying in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest returned to the mountain peak where they used to live and treated Wei Xian’s injuries. Fortunately, Wei Xian’s injuries were not serious and he recovered quickly.</p><p>However, his eyes were dejected.</p><p>The Wei family was almost exterminated, and he was the only one left.</p><p>“The he family!”</p><p>Wei Xian clenched his fists and his killing intent was endless.</p><p>At this moment, a group of powerful existences descended outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>These were the experts of the he clan. The few people in the lead were true Emperor realm experts, and he Qian was among them.</p><p>“Everyone, this is the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Please wait!”</p><p>Two teachers from the yuan mountain sacred Academy appeared, blocking the way of the experts from the he clan.</p><p>is Lu Ming in the yuan mountain sacred Institute? tell him to come out and face his death!</p><p>He Qian said coldly. He had long wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>everyone, this is the yuan mountain sacred Academy. No matter what grudges you have with Lu Ming, let’s settle them outside the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>A teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy said.</p><p>since you’re not asking Lu Ming to come out, we’ll go in and look for him!</p><p>The other true Emperor of the he clan spoke and stepped forward.</p><p>“Everyone, please wait!”</p><p>The teacher from the yuan mountain sacred Academy stretched out his hand and blocked in front of him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The true Emperor of the he clan struck out with his palm. The terrifying palm force sent the teacher of the yuan mountain sacred Academy flying as he coughed out blood.</p><p>This teacher of the yuan mountain sacred Academy was only a void Emperor. He could not stop the other party at all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The experts of the he family completely ignored the teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. They rushed into the yuan mountain sacred Academy and scanned it with their spiritual senses without any restraint, trying to find Lu Ming.</p><p>“Spread the news!”</p><p>The two teachers of the yuan mountain sacred Academy had ugly expressions as they spread the news.</p><p>The yuan mountain sacred Academy originally had three great emperors. The other powers didn’t dare to act impudently in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, after the battle with the evil god race, the two emperors of the yuan mountain sacred Academy had fallen. This news had already spread throughout the entire Yuan mountain.</p><p>This was why the he clan dared to barge into the yuan mountain sacred Academy without any restraint.</p><p>At the place where Lu Ming and the rest were staying.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming and the group felt a powerful spiritual sense sweep over and stop on them.</p><p>“The people of the he family are here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened, revealing a cold glint.</p><p>She didn’t expect that the he clan would actually dare to search the yuan mountain sacred Academy without any restraint.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the distance, a group of experts stepped on the air and arrived, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made it difficult for Lu Ming and the rest to breathe.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest rushed out of the room and stood in the air.</p><p>“He Qian!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw he Qian at one glance.</p><p>He Qian’s eyes swept towards Lu Ming and the rest. When his eyes swept past Lu Ming, they were filled with killing intent. When his eyes swept past Xiangxiang Bella, they were filled with greed.</p><p>He had to get Lu Xiangxiang!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you killed many of the he family’s experts for no reason. You must pay with your lives!”</p><p>He Qian was the first to speak, his voice filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“For no reason? It was laughable! You said that a life for a life, but they killed so many people from the Wei family, so it’s only a life for a life!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“How can the people of the Wei family be compared to the he family?”</p><p>He Qian retorted.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming laughed maniacally. His laughter was filled with contempt, which made the faces of the he family members darken.</p><p>your he family still thinks so highly of yourself. In my opinion, your he family is not even as good as a dog!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What did you say? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“You dog thing that doesn’t know death!”</p><p>The people of the he family were instantly furious.</p><p>“You guys still have the face? Let me ask you, when the evil god tribe invaded, where did your he clan go?”</p><p>in order to protect the yuan mountain, the others have risked their lives and fought a bloody battle against the evil god tribe. What about your he clan? you’re like a turtle hiding in its shell. When the battle is over, you’re out to reap the benefits. Are you still human? aren’t you worse than a dog? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice rang continuously.</p><p>He thought of the great emperors fighting to the death, and in the end, chaos sky great emperor and Sky Fire great emperor might not even be alive.</p><p>There were also some other powers who had suffered heavy losses and lost many experts in the war against the evil god tribe. But now, the he clan and the Heng clan had come out to snatch the territories of these powers and even killed the people of these powers.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s anger was burning.</p><p>“What nonsense are you talking about? You’re courting death for insulting the he family!”</p><p>“You have a sharp tongue. You must die today!”</p><p>The people of the he family shouted one after another.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The people of the he family emitted powerful auras.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you, no one can save you today, not even Emperor notionless. Also, 1’11 help you take care of your disciple Xiangxiang, hehehe!”</p><p>He Qian sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Old dog!” Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, on the nearby mountain peaks, many figures flew over and landed in front of Lu Ming and the others. They were also exuding powerful auras.</p><p>There were void emperors and true emperors!</p><p>These experts came from Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and the shenyuan Empire.</p><p>&Nbsp; they had just wiped out the evil god race and had stayed here for the time being.</p><p>“You think you can stop the he family with your small forces? You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>He Qian sneered.</p><p>Following that, many figures flickered over from the distance. They were all terrifying experts.</p><p>More powerhouses from the he clan had arrived. Most of them were at the Martial Emperor realm and some of them were at the true Emperor realm.</p><p>The number of experts from the he family increased. The terrifying aura suppressed Phoenix Palace. The expressions of the experts from the divine elephant sect changed drastically.</p><p>The he clan was a great emperor-level force. They were too powerful and had many terrifying existences of the true Emperor realm.</p><p>It was not something that forces like Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect could compare to.</p><p>“Today, 1 will personally take Lu Ming’s head!”</p><p>He Qian said and stepped forward. His powerful aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>The true emperors of the Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and divine origin Empire wanted to help but they were all locked on by the aura of the he clan’s true Emperor. If they moved, the other party would launch a thunderous attack.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. He was locked in place by he Qian’s aura and he could not move at all.</p><p>The true Emperor was too strong. He was not someone he could fight against.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes, and they flickered. He was considering whether he should control the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to kill him.”</p><p>At this time, a figure flickered over..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
