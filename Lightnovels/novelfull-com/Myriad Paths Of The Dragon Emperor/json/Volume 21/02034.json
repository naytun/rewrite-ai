That’s true. The competition must continue, continue!</p><p>The you family head laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>Even if the other party wanted to end the competition early, he wouldn’t agree to it.</p><p>The competition continued, but no one paid much attention to it.</p><p>They all thought that the outcome had been decided and that continuing the competition was just a formality.</p><p>if Lu Ming is smart, he will rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat when he’s up against the others later. Otherwise, he won’t stand a chance when he meets Ji Tian later!</p><p>“Yes, if I were Lu Ming, I would definitely do the same!”</p><p>Many people seemed to have already guessed the outcome. Later on, Lu Ming would definitely rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat.</p><p>The doyens continued to draw numbers. Lu Ming was up against a skinny young man from the you family.</p><p>The two of them stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Brat, let me finish you off!”</p><p>The skinny young man was smug. He also thought that Lu Ming would take the initiative to rush down the fighting ring and admit defeat. Otherwise, Lu Ming would be finished if he encountered Ji Tian in the next round.</p><p>Therefore, he daringly charged at Lu Ming and pounced on him.</p><p>Then, he saw a fist rapidly expanding in front of his eyes, and then heavily hit his nose.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The skinny young man’s nose was broken. With a scream, his body was sent flying hundreds of meters away and fell on the fighting ring.</p><p>‘This…’</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>They initially thought that Lu Ming would take the initiative to rush down from the fighting ring and admit defeat. They did not expect that Lu Ming would attack them directly.</p><p>perhaps he’s just concerned about his reputation and wants to win one round before admitting defeat!</p><p>hehe, if we’re unlucky and we encounter Ji Tian in the next round, he’ll definitely regret it!</p><p>Some people sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and rushed to the side of the skinny young man. He kicked the skinny young man off the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming won this round.</p><p>However, the people of the Luo family only shook their heads slightly. Whether they won or not would not change the final result.</p><p>This way, the Luo family was left with only Lu Ming, while the you family had six people.</p><p>The competition continued, but the next number to be drawn was from the you family. Whoever was drawn would have a battle with Lu Ming.</p><p>“You family, number 47!”</p><p>The elder announced, and a young lady from the you family took the stage.</p><p>Many people began to guess whether Lu Ming would admit defeat in this round. It was because the further they went, the higher the chances of him meeting Ji Tian.</p><p>Many people felt that Lu Ming wanted to win one round and then admit defeat to save some face.</p><p>However, Lu Ming made his move and blasted the young woman off the fighting ring in two moves.</p><p>“Still not admitting defeat, you really want face to the death!”</p><p>“Hehe, let’s see how Ji Tian regrets it when we meet him later!”</p><p>Some people sneered.</p><p>The competition continued. The next person was still not Ji Tian. Naturally, he was easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Perhaps it was luck, but the next few people were not Ji Tian. Lu Ming defeated them all.</p><p>There were only two people left in the you family’s arena. They were Ji Tian and the other person was Ji Peng.</p><p>Lu Ming is still not admitting defeat. Does he really want to fight Ji Tian? ”</p><p>At this point, some people had changed their minds because Lu Ming had not admitted defeat. If this went on, they would definitely encounter Ji Tian.</p><p>“How is that possible? He won’t even have the chance to escape from the fighting ring if he fights with Ji Tian. He’ll definitely be killed!”</p><p>“I don’t know what he’s thinking, he’s really crazy!”</p><p>The crowd was abuzz with discussion, but Ji Peng’s expression was unsightly.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not admit defeat, she would not have to face him in the next round.</p><p>He kept praying in his heart that Lu Ming would meet Ji Tian in the next round.</p><p>Unfortunately, things did not go as he wished!</p><p>you family, number nine, Ji Peng!</p><p>The founding elder drew a number and called out.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Ji Peng roared in his heart.</p><p>Why is he here? Why was Lu Ming always unable to touch Ji Tian?</p><p>Many people were also speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming was too lucky. It was strange that he could not meet Ji Tian.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring and looked at Ji Peng. He smiled faintly and said,”Come down!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s face was gloomy as he stepped onto the fighting ring. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, I advise you to admit defeat. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death when you meet my brother in the next round!”</p><p>Right now, Ji Peng’s heart was filled with complicated feelings.</p><p>Naturally, he hoped that Lu Ming would encounter Ji Tian and then be killed by him.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming continued to fight, he would be in a very miserable state!</p><p>“You’re actually thinking about me? I can’t figure it out, I beat you up so badly back then!”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately looked surprised.</p><p>Ji Peng gritted his teeth and roared in his heart. If I wasn’t facing you in this battle, would I have thought of you?</p><p>But now, he could only go against his will and say,” what happened back then is in the past. I think you’re still a talent. Quickly admit defeat!</p><p>“Admit defeat? Forget it, my plan is to give you a good beating, and then go and give your big brother a good beating!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and even stretched out his fist.</p><p>“You’re crazy!”</p><p>Ji Peng roared in anger. Then, he suddenly turned around and rushed down the fighting stage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure moved and caught up to him. With a palm strike, lightning flashed and enveloped Ji Peng like a large net.</p><p>Ji Peng tried his best to resist, but when the lightning struck, all his attacks were destroyed.</p><p>;O…</p><p>Ji Peng’s entire body was covered in lightning, which slithered around like little black snakes.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming then slapped Ji Peng’s face. Ji Peng let out a blood-curdling screech as blood mixed with his teeth spurted out. At the same time, more lightning bolts covered Ji Peng’s body.</p><p>His hair stood on end, and white smoke came out of his seven orifices as if he had been electrocuted. He looked extremely miserable.</p><p>In the stands, you ning, Ji Tian, and Ji Tian’s father, the defender-general of the state, all had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming’s act of humiliating Ji Peng was equivalent to a slap to their faces.</p><p>“I’ll pay him back tenfold for what he did to Ji Peng!”</p><p>Ji Tian said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming clutched Ji Peng’s neck and walked to the edge of the fighting ring step by step. Then, he threw Ji Peng off the grandstand.</p><p>He extended a finger at random and pointed at Ji Tian. He curled his finger and said,” “Come, King physique!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ji Tian couldn’t help but rush up to the fighting ring.</p><p>Anyway, he was the only one left in the you family, so there was no need to draw a number.</p><p>this Lu Ming really wants to fight Ji Tian. Where did he get the guts? ”</p><p>“It’s indeed strange. Could it be that Lu Ming still has a trump card?”</p><p>this is a fair fight. No monarch weapons are allowed. He doesn’t have a King physique, what trump card would he have? ”</p><p>Many people were in a heated discussion. They could not figure out what Lu Ming was up to.</p><p>With Ji Tian’s combat strength, Lu Ming would definitely die if he went up against Ji Tian. Why did he not admit defeat earlier? why did he hold on until now?</p><p>Was it just to humiliate Ji Peng? but it wasn’t worth risking his life!</p><p>Many people were curious. They looked at the fighting ring, wanting to know what would happen to Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
