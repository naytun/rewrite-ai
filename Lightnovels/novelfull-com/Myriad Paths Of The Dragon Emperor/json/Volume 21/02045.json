His fist was covered in a layer of black light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As this punch passed by, it seemed as if it was going to tear the space apart and collide with the void.</p><p>Shockingly, when this punch landed on the void law, it shook violently, as if it was about to be torn apart by ancient Devil’s fist.</p><p>what a terrifying attack. But why don’t I feel any fluctuations of laws from him?”</p><p>“I didn’t feel it either. What’s going on?”</p><p>Some people were discussing in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He was very surprised.</p><p>He didn’t feel the power of any laws from the ancient devil. He only felt the explosive power of the ancient devil, which seemed to be able to tear apart all laws.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Some of the older generation seemed to have noticed something, and their faces were filled with shock and horror.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The child of the void from the ancient devil nation let out a long howl as a beam of void light shot out and enveloped his entire body. He erupted with his full strength as his void law and Saint energy combined to form demonic blades.</p><p>“Blade of nothingness, turn into nothingness!”</p><p>The son of the void’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He waved his arms, and void blades shot toward ancient devil.</p><p>As long as one was struck by this blade of nothingness, everything would be reduced to nothingness. Not even the most basic particles would be left behind. This was the terrifying power of the void!</p><p>However, the elder Devil was not afraid at all. He was covered in a layer of black demonic light as he continued to punch.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>His fists kept clashing with the void blades, and deafening rumbles sounded in the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a dozen or so moves, the void blade was actually shattered by the ancient devil and exploded.</p><p>The ancient devil stepped into the air and was shrouded in demonic light. It was overbearing and unparalleled, as if a true ancient demonic god had awakened.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Ancient devil launched a storm of attacks, forcing the son of void to retreat.</p><p>At the scene, regardless of whether it was the Emperor level experts or the younger generation of the eternal devil nation, everyone was shocked beyond words.</p><p>The son of the void was actually being suppressed in just a dozen moves.</p><p>Even the child of death, who was ranked first, couldn’t do this.</p><p>Furthermore, they did not sense any nomological fluctuations from the ancient devil.</p><p>how can he be so terrifying? I can clearly sense that his cultivation is also in the perfected absolute Saint realm. Why is his combat strength so terrifying? he’s even suppressing the Son of Heaven!</p><p>“What laws does he control?”</p><p>I can’t sense the power of laws!</p><p>The voices were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Could it be an ancient devil cultivator?”</p><p>it must be. It must be a primordial demonic cultivator. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have such terrifying power. I didn’t expect that a primordial demonic cultivator would appear in the primordial realm!</p><p>At this moment, a few white-haired old men spoke. Their voices were filled with shock and solemness.</p><p>“An immemorial devil cultivator?”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded. This was the first time they had heard of this term.</p><p>the heaven realm’s cultivation history is far above that of the primordial realm. According to legend, the heaven realm’s primordial era’s cultivation system was completely different from today’s cultivation system!</p><p>the path of cultivation back then did not cultivate the power of laws. Instead, it focused more on one’s own body. Those who succeeded in cultivating it would have extremely terrifying offensive power. There was a saying that one’s power could break all laws!</p><p>the ancient cultivation system is divided into many types. The ancient demonic Dao at that time was the true Demonic Cultivation. The origin demonic power was shocking and unparalleled in attack!</p><p>An old man muttered a bunch of things.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>the ancient cultivation system … Could it be that the ancient devil cultivated the ancient cultivation system? ”</p><p>ancient devil should be cultivating the primordial diabolism. However, the primordial cultivation system is extremely difficult to cultivate. It’s even more difficult to succeed. Later, when the nomological system rose, the primordial cultivation system slowly disappeared. Even in the heaven realm, it’s rare. I didn’t expect the primordial cultivation system to appear in the primordial realm!</p><p>Next to Lu Ming and the rest, the master of the Luo family sighed. He had also seen some rumors.</p><p>There were also some elders who sighed. In fact, the devil cultivators now could no longer be considered true devil cultivators.</p><p>Luo Xuan, Wu Xi, and the others were shocked when they heard this.</p><p>Ancient devil had gained the upper hand. The son of void kept retreating until his fist broke through the void’s law.</p><p>The void law was said to be able to turn everything into nothingness, but it couldn’t break the layer of demonic light on the ancient Devil’s body. Instead, the demonic light pierced through the void law.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic light whistled and almost tore apart the law light of the son of the void. His figure retreated frantically, and a stream of blood spilled from his mouth.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>The elder Devil said coolly. He looked ordinary, but he had the belief that he was invincible.</p><p>The son of the void’s face turned pale. He had only exchanged a few moves, and he was already defeated.</p><p>His opponent’s cultivation base was not higher than his. They were on the same level. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>Every child of God had the belief that they were invincible. They believed that they could defeat all their enemies and reach the peak.</p><p>The reason he had lost to the child of death before was that the child of death had broken through to the perfection of the Saint realm longer than he had, and his nomological laws were stronger than his.</p><p>When he caught up in this aspect, he would not lose.</p><p>But now, he had been defeated by the ancient devil.</p><p>The son of the void’s expression changed. In the end, he shook his head and sighed. He landed on a seat and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>At this moment, ancient devil’s eyes turned to the child of death.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue?”</p><p>Ancient devil asked.</p><p>The son of death of the ancient devil nation, GE long, had a grim expression on his face.</p><p>Ancient Devil’s meaning was very clear. GE long was only slightly stronger than the son of the void, but ancient devil could crush the son of the void.</p><p>It was obvious who was stronger and who was weaker. Was there still a need to fight?</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>GE long was very direct. He stepped forward, and the light of death surrounded his body.</p><p>“Let’s decide the winner in one move. If 1 can’t defeat you in one move, it’s my loss!”</p><p>GE long stared at ancient devil.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>The elder Devil spoke with confidence.</p><p>The hearts of countless people from the eternal demon nation were on tenterhooks.</p><p>GE long was their last hope. If even GE long was defeated, then the eternal demon Empire would be completely wiped out.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s face turned dark.</p><p>He knew that undying Emperor was here to slap his face.</p><p>Just when he had overcome the Tribulation of heaven and earth and the whole country was celebrating, he had come to slap his face.</p><p>On the fighting ring, GE long and ancient devil faced each other.</p><p>Their auras grew stronger and stronger. When they reached their peak, GE long made his move.</p><p>death’s abyss!</p><p>GE long moved his hands. As his hands moved, a huge abyss appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>This abyss was huge and pitch black. It was filled with the aura of death, as if it wanted to bury everything under the abyss.</p><p>Although GE long and the blade of death both controlled the death law, the way they used it was very different.</p><p>In fact, even if one controlled the same nomological law, different people would naturally have different ways of using it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
