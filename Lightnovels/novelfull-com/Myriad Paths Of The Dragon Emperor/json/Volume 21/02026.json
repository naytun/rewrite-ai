What’s wrong with him?”</p><p>The eldest Princess was puzzled.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, Lu Ming crippled the cultivation of two of our Ji family’s absolute Saints in the Great Perfection for no reason yesterday. He even broke Ji Peng’s limbs. He must pay for his actions!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s big brother said coldly.</p><p>Ji Peng’s elder brother was called Ji Tian!</p><p>“There’s actually such a thing!”</p><p>The eldest Princess raised her brows and ordered her servants,” “Call Lu Ming over!”</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating when he heard the commotion outside. He got up and came out.</p><p>“Young master Lu, the eldest Princess has invited you!”</p><p>A middle-aged guard said.</p><p>“He came so quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The first thought that came to his mind was that the Ji family had come looking for him.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He and the middle-aged guard went to the main hall of the eldest Princess.</p><p>“As expected, it’s the Ji family!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Ji Peng the moment he arrived at the main hall.</p><p>Ji Peng and the rest also looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you cripple the cultivation of a few of the Ji family’s experts yesterday?”</p><p>The eldest Princess sat at the head of the table and asked with a cold and arrogant expression.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>How dare you! You’re even touched by my Ji family! Kill yourself and I’ll leave your corpse intact!</p><p>Ji Peng’s uncle smacked the table and coldly said.</p><p>what a joke. They wanted to kill me. Can’t 1 fight back? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Do you understand who you’re talking to? This attitude!”</p><p>Ji Peng’s uncle’s eyes were like lightning as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming. A powerful pressure emanated from him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed, and he could not help but take a few steps back. Ji Peng’s uncle was definitely a terrifying expert.</p><p>“It seems like the Ji family doesn’t even care about the eldest Princess!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Uncle Ji Peng’s expression changed slightly, and he retracted his aura.</p><p>After all, this was the eldest princess’s residence and Lu Ming was the eldest princess’s man in name. Without the eldest princess’s consent, he would have crossed the line if he attacked her directly.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, this person crippled the cultivation of our Ji family’s expert and injured Ji Peng. He must be punished. Otherwise, how can our Ji family rule the Army and convince the masses?”</p><p>Ji Tian said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>The eldest Princess asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was not bad. He would be useful to her in the near future. She did not want Lu Ming to be crippled just like that.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, yesterday, Ji Peng brought a few people from the Ji family and barged into my courtyard. They threatened to cripple me and attack me. I was only protecting myself. If 1 hadn’t attacked, I would have been dead by now!”</p><p>Lu Ming recounted what had happened yesterday.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>The eldest Princess nodded. Ji Peng, you’ve gone too far in this matter. Lu Ming is my guest elder after all. However, Lu Ming’s actions were too heavy. How about this? I’ll take out some treasures to compensate the Ji family. Also, Lu Ming, you’ll apologize to the Ji family in public. What do you think?”</p><p>“Apologize to the Ji family!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>What did he do wrong in this matter? how could he apologize?</p><p>no, we have to at least cripple his four limbs and make him apologize in public!</p><p>Ji Peng called out.</p><p>“That’s right, this person must be punished!”</p><p>Ji Tian followed.</p><p>in my opinion, both sides should take a step back. Lu Ming will apologize in public and give some compensation. Then, this matter will be settled. How about it?”</p><p>The eldest Princess spoke again.</p><p>At the same time, she sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming,” “Lu Ming, Ji Peng’s father is the defender-general of the state. The Ji family is extremely powerful. Bear with it, apologize to the Ji family, and give them some compensation. If you take a step back, you’ll have a better life!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered!</p><p>What taking a step back would open up the world?</p><p>This matter was not his fault at all. The eldest Princess actually wanted him to apologize. It was obvious that she did not want to offend the Ji family.</p><p>However, the Ji family obviously didn’t want to let it go so easily.</p><p>Princess, we can give you face today and not deal with him for the time being. However, Princess, you must drive this person out of the princess’s Manor!</p><p>Ji Peng’s uncle said.</p><p>Ji Peng, Ji Tian, and the others sneered.</p><p>After being expelled from the princess’s Manor and without the eldest Princess ■protection, given the Ji family’s strength, Lu Ming would die in whatever way they wanted him to!</p><p>The eldest Princess frowned. She naturally knew the Ji family’s intentions.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was not bad. Since he could defeat Ji Peng, his combat strength was definitely above Ji Peng’s. It would be of great help in the battle with the Luo family twenty days later. It would be a pity to give up just like that.</p><p>eldest Princess, our Ji family has always been on your side. If this kid affects our relationship, I’m afraid it’ll be a loss for you!</p><p>Ji Peng’s uncle said indifferently, his words hinting at something.</p><p>The eldest princess’s expression was somewhat unsightly.</p><p>The Ji family was threatening her.</p><p>However, she had to compromise.</p><p>The Ji family was extremely powerful. If she helped the Luo family, it would have a huge impact on her.</p><p>The most important thing was Ji Tian.</p><p>Ji Tian had a King body, and the number of King bodies in the entire youluo demonic kingdom could be counted on one hand.</p><p>In the battle with the Luo family 20 days later, Ji Tian was of utmost importance as he could influence the outcome.</p><p>Therefore, no matter what, she had to keep the Ji family in her hands and not ruin their relationship.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through the eldest princess’s mind.</p><p>“Eldest Princess, you have to consider this carefully. My big brother has the king physique and can decide the outcome of this battle with the Luo clan …”</p><p>Seeing that the eldest Princess didn’t say anything, Ji Peng coldly spoke.</p><p>Having said that, he even cast a disdainful look at Lu Ming.</p><p>What he meant was, so what if you have some combat power? Can he be compared to my big brother? Could it be compared to the king physique?</p><p>The eldest princess’s brows twitched slightly. Ji Peng’s words made her very unhappy.</p><p>But she couldn’t lose the Ji family’s support, so she muttered to herself and made a decision.</p><p>The eldest Princess looked at Lu Ming. Lu Ming, you’ve gone too far this time. You’ve already broken the rules by hitting me so hard. So, please leave the princess’s Manor!</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The eldest Princess had indeed chosen the Ji family.</p><p>In her opinion, Lu Ming was just a talent with some combat ability. He could not be compared to the Ji family.</p><p>In particular, Ji Tian’s King physique could play a key role in the confrontation with the Luo family this time.</p><p>The people from the Ji family sneered. As long as Lu Ming left the eldest princess’s Manor, he would be dead.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not say much. He turned and left.</p><p>Since the eldest Princess had already chosen the Ji family, there was no need for him to stay.</p><p>After taking a few steps, Lu Ming stopped and turned to look at Ji Tian. He said indifferently,” “King physique? Is it that amazing?”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned and strode away, disappearing from the hall.</p><p>you’re just a frog at the bottom of a well. I’m afraid you don’t even know how powerful the king physique is!</p><p>“Very soon, he will know how strong the king physique is!”</p><p>Some of the Ji family members sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attitude made it seem as if he did not care about the king physique at all. They were very unhappy..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
