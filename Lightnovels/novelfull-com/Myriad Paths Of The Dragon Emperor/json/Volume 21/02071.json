Were all these similar to Xie nianqing’s current situation?</p><p>At the same time, he also thought about how he had seen Xie nianqing’s painful expression all this time. Could all of this be related?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. He did not stop and pointed two fingers at Xie nianqing.</p><p>This was because Xie nianqing was too strong. His demonic power could break through all obstacles and destroy everything.</p><p>The combined force of Lu Ming’s few laws seemed to be difficult to resist and was about to be torn apart.</p><p>“Little official’s cultivation looks like it’s in the great circle of the absolute Saint stage, similar to mine. But what kind of power is this? Could it also be a power cultivated by the primordial diabolism?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and pointed his finger.</p><p>This finger contained the Laws of Chaos, array Dao laws, and death laws.</p><p>The huge finger pointed at Xie nianqing’s sword light.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s sword radiance slashed down, and even the space around it cracked. It was too shocking. The sword radiance slashed on the huge finger and broke it.</p><p>“Little Qing, wake up!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>He didn’t believe that Xie nianqing would really kill him.</p><p>lowly ant, you’ve tainted my body. You deserve to die!</p><p>Xie nianqing spoke again, his expression cold. The demonic light on her body grew stronger, and it was as if there was an endless stream of energy flowing out of her body. The cold sword light continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Her sword light was even stronger than before.</p><p>The sword light flashed and illuminated the valley.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had used all his strength, he was still no match for Xie nianqing. The fusion of three types of laws could not withstand Xie nianqing’s sword radiance and was torn apart by it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was cut by the sword light and a deep wound appeared. It was so deep that his bones could be seen. Blood flowed out and dyed his clothes red.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming was injured, Xie nianqing’s gaze finally wavered.</p><p>Her figure slightly paused and stopped.</p><p>kill him! He has defiled me! 1 must kill him!</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted, as if he was talking to himself.</p><p>Her eyes turned cold again. She raised her sword and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light was like a rainbow, cutting through the sky.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming did not move or block it. He let the sword radiance stab at him.</p><p>Seeing that the sword light was about to pierce through Lu Ming’s heart, Xie nianqing’s eyes showed signs of struggle.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>She shouted and moved her wrist. The sword gleam deviated slightly and pierced through Lu Ming’s chest. However, it had already deviated from the position of his heart.</p><p>“Xiao Qing, if you want to kill, 1’11 let you kill. If you’re pregnant with our child, take good care of him in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Xie nianqing gently.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie nianqing continued to shout. It sounded like two people were talking, but it was clearly only one person’s voice.</p><p>The struggle in Xie nianqing’s eyes grew stronger. Even his beautiful face started to twist.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s wrong with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s condition was obviously not right. It was as if there were two people in his body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care!”</p><p>In the end, Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming tenderly, turned around, and left. Like a rainbow, he rushed into the depths of the canyon.</p><p>A few rumbles came from the valley, but the rumbles disappeared in the next moment.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The sword gleam that stabbed into Lu Ming’s body was condensed by Xie nianqing’s demonic energy. It had already dissipated. Lu Ming rushed into the depths of the canyon.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming had run a distance away, two middle-aged burly men appeared and attacked him.</p><p>Lu Ming was blocked and could not rush over at all. In the end, he was struck back by the two middle-aged burly men.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, he was extremely anxious and his heart was filled with endless questions.</p><p>However, he was blocked and couldn’t rush over at all. He couldn’t find Xie nianqing and couldn’t ask him what was going on.</p><p>“It must be related to the power in little Qing’s body. What is it? Xie nianjun also has one!”</p><p>also, those black robed men purposely stole the ancient demonic coffin and placed little Qing in it. Could it be related to this? ”</p><p>“The next time 1 see Xie nianjun, 1 must ask him clearly!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. He was really a little afraid. He was afraid that Xie nianqing would no longer be the Xie nianqing he used to be and that he would become another person.</p><p>Xie nianqing had broken through several levels in a row. The strength he had displayed was shocking.</p><p>She only stopped after breaking through a few levels.</p><p>why didn’t you let me kill him? he has tainted us!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was cold and murderous.</p><p>“If you kill him, 1’11 kill myself!”</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing muttered to himself.</p><p>“Why are you so persistent? you are me, and 1 am you. Let us merge completely and return to the Supreme realm. Why are you trapped in this small world?”</p><p>no, you are you, I am me. 1 will never merge with you, never!</p><p>Xie nianqing seemed to be talking to himself. Then, his body moved and he rushed out of the canyon. Soon, his figure completely disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on a Black Rock, deep in thought.</p><p>He thought about it a lot, but he still couldn’t think of an answer.</p><p>strength. As long as I’m strong enough, I’ll definitely understand everything and restore little Qing to her original state!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. Slowly, his heart calmed down.</p><p>Lu Ming had experienced too much along the way. He was very clear that it was useless to be anxious when he encountered something. It was better to calm down and improve his strength.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and sat there quietly.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming opened his eyes. His gaze had become calm.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the path-understanding ancient tree and sat cross-legged under it to study the law of death.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree was already ten meters tall. Its branches and leaves were flourishing, and a mysterious light surrounded the branches. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>All these years, Lu Ming had spent a great price to cultivate the path-understanding ancient tree. As expected, the path-understanding ancient tree had improved greatly.</p><p>Comprehending nomological laws under the Dao Comprehension ancient tree would yield twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed. Lu Ming’s death precept had improved very quickly. At the same time, his integration with the other two types of precepts had also become more thorough. His strength was increasing every day.</p><p>This time, he successfully passed through the two middle-aged men and continued to move forward.</p><p>However, this time, three middle-aged men appeared in front of him. The three of them joined forces to fight Lu Ming. Lu Ming was blocked again, so he could only stop and continue to improve his strength.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had an idea. He waved his hand and the ancient demon coffin appeared in the canyon.</p><p>In the ancient demonic coffin, Qiu Yue’s body exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>After a few months, Qiu Yue finally showed some changes.</p><p>In the past, the people from Vientiane tower had said that Qiu Yue would wake up after staying in the eternal demonic coffin for a month. However, in reality, three months had passed.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu…</p><p>At this moment, a powerful suction force erupted from Qiu Yue’s body. The energy of the world quickly surged towards Qiu Yue.</p><p>“He’s about to break through?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He then took out a large number of raw gemstones and blasted them apart, turning them into billowing original Qi that gathered towards Qiu Yue..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
