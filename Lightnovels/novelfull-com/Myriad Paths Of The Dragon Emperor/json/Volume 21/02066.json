Xie nianqing was lying in the eternal demonic coffin. He was determined to get his hands on the coffin.</p><p>Lu Ming waved the stone sword and launched a storm of attacks at the black-robed Emperor.</p><p>The black-robed Emperor was forced back again.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming thought that he had a chance to put away the eternal demonic coffin, the space at the top of the mountain cracked open all of a sudden. A figure appeared out of nowhere. His entire body was covered in demonic light, and his appearance could not be seen clearly. With a wave of his hand, a huge hand formed and grabbed at the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming abandoned the black-robed Emperor and stomped on the ground. His huge body rushed toward the figure that had suddenly appeared. At the same time, he slashed out with his stone sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword light shattered the giant hand, but it didn’t stop and continued to attack the opponent.</p><p>The other party could only block and collide with the stone sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The figure took a few steps back, and the demonic light covering his body shook, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>“Undying Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed!</p><p>This expert who had suddenly appeared was actually the undying Emperor of the undying demon nation.</p><p>undying Emperor wants the ancient demon nation’s national treasure, the ancient demon coffin!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he guessed undying Emperor’s intention.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The undying Emperor didn’t want to fight with Lu Ming. He turned into more than a dozen figures and rushed toward the ancient demonic coffin from all directions.</p><p>It was impossible to tell which one was real from which one was fake. It was as if every single one of them was real.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in his heart and controlled the golems. The golems ‘bodies shrunk rapidly, becoming the size of ordinary people.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed increased dramatically after he turned into the size of a normal person. He took a step forward and rushed towards the ancient demonic coffin. At the same time, he slashed out more than ten sword lights towards the undying Emperor’s shadows.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The undying Emperor’s dozen figures attacked at the same time. They displayed their terrifying combat strength and crushed Lu Ming’s sword radiance.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to reach the ancient demonic coffin, the black-robed Emperor appeared again and blocked him.</p><p>The three of them were caught in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Lu Ming and the undying Emperor wanted to take the eternal demonic coffin while the black-robed Emperor wanted to protect it. The three of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming was furious. He completely ignored his own defense. The energy in the golem burst out wildly and suppressed the other two people for a moment.</p><p>But this way, the golems ‘energy consumption was also shocking, they could not last for too long.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The black-robed Emperor roared in a hoarse voice. He took Lu Ming’s attack head-on at the risk of being injured and retreated back to the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>At the same time, he struck out a move at the ancient demonic coffin, causing it to fly out.</p><p>In that direction, there was a pitch-black Canyon that was filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>The ancient demon coffin flew into the valley and disappeared.</p><p>“The ancient demonic coffin is mine!”</p><p>Undying Emperor charged into the canyon.</p><p>However, just as he was about to rush in, he was stopped by a force. Then, undying Emperor’s body was blown out.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he also rushed towards the canyon!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the entrance of the canyon, Lu Ming seemed to have hit a wall. There was a force that stopped him.</p><p>Lu Ming frantically unleashed the power within the golems but it was useless. He was blocked by that force and could not charge in at all.</p><p>Moreover, there was an extremely powerful force in the canyon that rushed toward Lu Ming. Even the power of the golems could not withstand it and Lu Ming was pushed back.</p><p>those above the rank of martial Supreme can’t enter. Those below the rank of martial supreme will never be able to come out after entering!</p><p>The black-robed Emperor sneered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear him. He took a step forward and rushed toward the canyon.</p><p>When he was about to reach the entrance of the canyon, the stone golem glowed and suddenly disappeared. Lu Ming’s original body appeared.</p><p>With a swish, Lu Ming dashed into the canyon and disappeared.</p><p>“Below the rank of a martial Supreme!”</p><p>The black-robed Emperor blurted out before sneering.”Those below the rank of martial Supreme may be able to enter, but they will never be able to come out!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Undying Emperor roared and charged into the canyon again. Black robe didn’t stop him.</p><p>This time, undying Emperor didn’t make it into the canyon. He was sent flying out by a force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent boom came from the sky. Then, two beams of light rushed over and two figures appeared.</p><p>They were the ancient Emperor and the black-robed Emperor.</p><p>The two black-robed emperors gathered together.</p><p>The ancient Emperor glared at the undying Emperor coldly. “Even if I’m not dead, you’re still here for the ancient demon coffin?”</p><p>brother Ancient One, you couldn’t even protect your own treasure properly, and it was stolen by someone else. I’m here to help you retrieve it!</p><p>The undying Emperor sneered.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor said coldly. He then looked at the canyon and walked towards it.</p><p>The two black-robed emperors stood to the side without any intention of stopping him.</p><p>However, just like undying Emperor, the ancient Emperor couldn’t enter and was sent flying out.</p><p>“You can’t go in, please go back!”</p><p>A black-robed Emperor said.</p><p>“You guys stole my ancient demonic coffin. Are you not going to hand it over?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s eyes were as cold as ice.</p><p>of course it’s useful. Besides, I can’t give it to you even if I wanted to. Those above martial Supreme can’t enter, and those below martial Supreme can’t come out even if they enter!</p><p>A black-robed Emperor sneered.</p><p>“Anyone below the rank of martial Supreme can’t come out?”</p><p>The ancient Emperor frowned.</p><p>so, please go back. Don’t think about letting anyone below the rank of a martial Supreme enter. This place is our tribe’s Holy Land. No one is allowed to enter!</p><p>A black-robed Emperor spoke, and the two of them stood in front of the canyon.</p><p>“Haha, this is your business, 1 won’t get involved!”</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed. Although he couldn’t get the ancient demonic coffin, it wasn’t his anyway.</p><p>On the other hand, the ancient Emperor had lost his ancient demonic coffin and suffered a huge loss.</p><p>The undying Emperor laughed and tore the space apart.</p><p>The ancient Emperor looked at the canyon with a look of unwillingness. He then rushed into the sky and shouted,” “Stop! Leave this place!”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The black-robed Emperor ordered.</p><p>Instantly, the people from both sides stopped fighting and rushed into the sky. He walked to the side of the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“The great emperor and the Azure Demon King were killed by Lu Ming!”</p><p>One of the true emperors reported to the ancient Emperor.</p><p>“I know, Cang Demon King only has himself to blame!”</p><p>The ancient Emperor nodded his head with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>&Nbsp; although he had been fighting with the enemy, he had still been paying attention to the situation below, so he naturally knew what had happened.</p><p>He was shocked that Lu Ming had a terrifying treasure like the celestial Thearch’s body. Moreover, the Cang Demon King had gone too far. He deserved to be killed by Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
