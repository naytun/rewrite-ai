They couldn’t all be great emperors. They were just from the same race.</p><p>A group of black-robed men, who looked thin and not very burly, were currently surrounding a huge black demon coffin. They kept turning around and shouting in different voices, as if they were performing some kind of ritual.</p><p>“That is … The ancient demonic coffin?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the huge black demonic coffin on the screen, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, one of the black-robed men looked up into the sky as if he was looking in their direction. Then, he waved his hand, and the void trembled. The image created by the ancient Emperor collapsed.</p><p>It was obvious that the other great emperor had noticed that the ancient Emperor was peeking at them.</p><p>“There’s a great sovereign realm expert on the other side. He’s the one 1 fought with last time. There are a few other experts with him. 1’11 hold him back later. You guys go and take the ancient demonic coffin. After that, leave the demonic sea immediately. Do you understand?” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>The ancient Emperor ordered.</p><p>“Yes, great emperor!”</p><p>Everyone acknowledged the order.</p><p>With the ancient Emperor leading the way, the group of them flew forward.</p><p>Soon, a huge mountain appeared in front of them. Everyone’s eyesight was amazing, and they could see it from far away.</p><p>That mountain peak was the image that the ancient Emperor had just shown.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was a group of black-robed men circling a huge demonic coffin.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s body flickered as he charged towards the mountain. His speed was so fast that it exceeded everyone’s reaction time.</p><p>As the ancient Emperor neared the mountain, a black beam of light shot out from the mountain. It was like a black waterfall, slicing through the void and slashing down at the ancient Emperor like a demonic blade.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ancient Emperor made his move as well. As the two of them clashed, a deafening boom reverberated through the heavens and earth.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The two of them continued to fight, and the sky rumbled. The two of them fought high up in the sky, tearing open the space, and fighting into an alternate dimension.</p><p>“It’s our turn to attack, kill!”</p><p>Cang mo shouted coldly and charged towards the mountain. Before he left, he cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of the strongest true emperors and void emperors rushed forward. They were the fastest, much faster than emperors-to-be.</p><p>Then, the Emperor-to-be with the largest number of people also rushed forward.</p><p>Lu Ming was among the many Emperor-to-be.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the martial sovereigns were about to reach the mountain in front of them. However, at this moment, two figures suddenly stopped in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>These were two old men with exceptionally powerful auras. They were both powerhouses of the empty Emperor realm.</p><p>The two of them exuded a faint murderous aura and blocked Lu Ming’s way.</p><p>Some of the Emperor-to-be looked at Lu Ming with pity, but no one stayed behind. They all flew forward.</p><p>All of a sudden, only Lu Ming and the two elders were left.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a deep voice.</p><p>“It’s simple, I’ll take your life!”</p><p>The old man on the right showed a cold smile.</p><p>“It’s the Cang Demon King who asked you to kill me again!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“So what if 1 know? I’m still going to die!”</p><p>The old man on the right said.</p><p>“It’s not good to end the battle quickly and be discovered by the great emperor!”</p><p>The old man on the left said.</p><p>The next moment, the two elders ‘auras rose sharply. The power of the world filled the air and they were about to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Then go to hell!”</p><p>At this moment, a sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was a stone sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming wielded the stone sword and slashed out. A crescent-shaped sword gleam was slashed out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The attacks and defenses of the two elders at the empty Emperor realm were completely useless. They were cut in half at the waist by Lu Ming’s sword. The terrifying sword Qi coursed through their bodies and instantly destroyed their souls.</p><p>In the face of the heavenly Emperor sword, the two void emperors were instantly killed without any resistance.</p><p>Lu Ming put away their storage rings and rushed to the mountain ahead.</p><p>At this moment, a huge battle had already erupted on the mountain.</p><p>The experts from the eternal devil nation were engaged in an intense battle with the black-robed figures.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and approached the mountain at high speed like a ghost.</p><p>He didn’t make a move. He wanted to use the God’s breath technique to climb up the mountain silently and take the ancient demon coffin.</p><p>Lu Ming walked along the mountain, using the huge rocks to avoid others. Soon, he was halfway up the mountain and would reach the top soon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were martial Supremes fighting all around the mountain. Rocks were flying everywhere. All kinds of huge rocks that were a few meters high or tens of meters high were thrown at Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body kept moving and he dodged them cleverly.</p><p>Lu Ming was rapidly approaching the peak of the mountain.</p><p>All of a sudden, a scorching aura blasted toward Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hair stood on end. He stopped in his tracks and retreated rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A scorching black light blasted the spot where Lu Ming had been standing. A pitch-black hole immediately appeared on the mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really lucky!”</p><p>An old man appeared in front of Lu Ming, his eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>If it wasn’t the Azure Demon King, who else could it be?</p><p>The ashen Demon King had just repelled an opponent and was about to rush to the top when he spotted Lu Ming. He had attacked Lu Ming directly, but the latter had been sharp enough to avoid an attack.</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s eyes flashed with a thick murderous intent and shock.</p><p>He had just sent two void emperors to kill Lu Ming. Those two were not ordinary void emperors. One was a three-star void Emperor while the other was a four-star void Emperor. However, Lu Ming was safe and sound now, which shocked him greatly.</p><p>He was determined to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>I didn’t kill you last time, so I’ll kill you again. This time, I’ll turn you into ashes and make your soul scatter. Let’s see if you’ll die or not!</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s eyes were sinister, and his entire body was covered in demonic flames.</p><p>A peak true Emperor was too terrifying. If he used his full strength, he could turn Lu Ming into ashes in one move.</p><p>Back in the ancient city, Cang Demon King had not used his full strength. Later on, Lu Ming had jumped into the magma, which had greatly hindered Cang Demon King’s attack.</p><p>Otherwise, Lu Ming would not have had the chance to merge the two Saint hearts.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ashen Demon King took a step forward. His demonic fire transformed into a demonic fire saber and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid. He held the stone sword and slashed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone sword and the demonic flame saber collided with a terrifying boom. Lu Ming could feel a powerful force surging towards him and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>However, the devil flame saber was also blocked by him.</p><p>“You… Your sword!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King was shocked. Lu Ming could actually block one of his moves.</p><p>His gaze fell on the stone sword in Lu Ming’s hand, which was emitting a blazing flame.</p><p>Lu Ming was only an absolute Saint, but he could control the stone sword and unleash such terrifying power. If he had it, wouldn’t he be able to fight against a great emperor?</p><p>His heart was burning with passion.</p><p>He understood that the two void emperors from before had been killed by this sword.</p><p>“Hand over the sword and 1’11 leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King said coldly as he stepped towards Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
