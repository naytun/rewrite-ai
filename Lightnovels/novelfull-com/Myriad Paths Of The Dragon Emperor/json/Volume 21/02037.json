For the next ten thousand years, the Luo family will be in charge of the youluo devil Kingdom!</p><p>Then, the elder from the youluo devil Kingdom announced.</p><p>The you family’s face was extremely dark and he was extremely unwilling.</p><p>However, this was a tradition of the youluo demonic kingdom that had been passed down for countless years. Even if he didn’t dare to do so, he would have to hand over the throne.</p><p>Unless the you family’s strength could crush the other forces in the youluo demonic kingdom, he could not break the tradition. However, it was obvious that the you family could not do it.</p><p>In the end, he could only hand over the scepter that represented the king.</p><p>Lu Ming had nothing to do next.</p><p>He sat in the stands and watched indifferently.</p><p>The next step was for the head of the Luo clan to take over the scepter. After a series of ceremonies, he began to take control of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>After the ceremony ended, it was time for the Grand banquet. By the time everything was over, it would be the next day.</p><p>A few days later, Luo Xuan brought a pile of treasures and said that they were Lu Ming’s rewards. Lu Ming accepted them without any hesitation.</p><p>The following days were peaceful again.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the little princess’s residence and cultivated quietly.</p><p>However, Luo Xuan would often look for Lu Ming in the name of sparring. Of course, Luo Xuan would return in defeat every time.</p><p>Time flew by, and a month and a half passed.</p><p>On this day, Luo Xuan found Lu Ming. They were going to head to the eternal devil nation.</p><p>In half a month’s time, the king of the ancient devil nation would be holding a huge banquet to celebrate his survival of the calamity of heaven and earth, granting him another 300000 years to live.</p><p>At that time, all the devil nations that were affiliated with the eternal devil nation would have to send people over to offer their congratulations.</p><p>The youluo devil Kingdom was a part of the eternal devil Kingdom.</p><p>we’re finally going to the eternal devil nation!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. In this way, he was one step closer to the ancient demonic coffin.</p><p>you ning and the rest have already left for the eternal devil nation a few days ago!</p><p>Rahu said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Luo Xuan to a teleportation array.</p><p>The head of the Luo family personally led the team. There were hundreds of people in the team, including some young geniuses, who stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>First, they arrived at the Citadel outside the capital of the eternal devil nation. Then, they flew towards the capital.</p><p>The ancient devil nation was one of the two Super Devil nations in the land of ten thousand Devils. It was a true giant and its capital was exceptionally majestic. It was not inferior to the celestial Emperor City in the yuan mountain.</p><p>The land of ten thousand Devils had two Super Devil nations and ten high-rank devil nations.</p><p>Naturally, they were divided into two camps, two Super Devil nations. They were enemies with each other, and each Super Devil nation ruled a large number of low-rank and middle-rank devil nations.</p><p>There were also five high-rank devil nations under their control.</p><p>As one of the five high-rank devil nations under the eternal devil nation, the you Luo devil Kingdom was naturally highly valued. The moment they arrived, there were people who received them and arranged their accommodations.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had been in the capital of the eternal devil nation for three days.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the young prince of the ashen Demon King’s residence is hosting a banquet today to invite the paragons of various countries. Shall we go and take a look?”</p><p>Luo Xuan found Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“The young prince of the Azure Demon King’s residence?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>the eternal devil nation is one of the two great devil nations in the land of ten thousand Devils. It rules over countless small nations, and many of them are inextricably linked to the powerful families of the eternal devil nation!</p><p>the ashen Demon King’s residence is the most powerful in the entire eternal devil nation. Our Luo family has a pretty good relationship with them. The young lord of the ashen demon clan is only inviting the geniuses of the other nations to his banquet to get closer to them!</p><p>Luo Xuan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. As long as there were benefits in any place, there would naturally be a relationship of benefits.</p><p>furthermore, every time the king of the ancient devil nation overcame a calamity, he would hold a banquet to allow the younger generation of each nation to compete with each other. Those who perform well would be heavily rewarded. Therefore, it’s only natural for the heaven’s favorites of each nation to meet up and understand each other’s strength!</p><p>Luo Xuan continued.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The king of the eternal demon nation would have the geniuses of the other nations compete with each other. This was a good opportunity for Lu Ming.</p><p>If he performed well and caught the king’s attention, he might be one step closer to borrowing the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Luo Xuan met up with the other Supreme talents of the youluo demonic kingdom, such as Wu Xi and the others, and headed for the gray Demon King’s residence.</p><p>Of course, you ning, Ji Tian, and the others were not with them.</p><p>You ning, Ji Tian, and the others had arrived at the capital of the eternal devil nation before them. They had different networks of connections.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a vast mansion. Someone received them and led them to a wide courtyard.</p><p>There were many tables and chairs in the courtyard. At this moment, many people had already arrived.</p><p>They were all people of the younger generation.</p><p>“Greetings, Princess Luo Xuan!”</p><p>When Luo Xuan arrived, many young men bowed to him.</p><p>The youluo devil Kingdom was a high-rank devil Kingdom and was one of the best among the five high-rank devil kingdoms under the eternal devil Kingdom. These young men were all from medium-rank and low-rank devil kingdoms. Their status was far inferior to Luo Xuan’s, so they naturally had to pay their respects when they saw him.</p><p>Luo Xuan nodded with a smile before taking a seat at the table above.</p><p>“Lu Ming, sit here!”</p><p>Princess Luo Xuan smiled as she pointed to a stool beside her.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and sat down beside Luo Xuan.</p><p>Wu Xi and the rest sat behind Luo Xuan and Lu Ming.</p><p>Many young men sized Lu Ming up with curious eyes.</p><p>Who was this person? he was actually sitting next to Princess Luo Xuan.</p><p>“Hahaha, Luo Xuan, long time no see!”</p><p>With a hearty laugh, a purple-robed young man strode over.</p><p>This person was quite handsome and had an extraordinary bearing. Behind him, there were a few youths.</p><p>“Greetings, young prince!”</p><p>Seeing this young man, all the young men hurriedly stood up and saluted.</p><p>Lu Ming and Luo Xuan also stood up and cupped their hands.</p><p>This person was the young prince of the Azure Demon King’s residence.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was an extremely fearsome existence. It was said that he was of the same generation as the king of the eternal devil nation. The relationship between the two of them was extraordinary.</p><p>Hence, the Azure Demon King was extremely influential in the eternal demon nation.</p><p>As the grandson of the Azure Demon King, the young Prince’s status was noble. He was also a terrifying heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“No need to be so polite, please sit!”</p><p>The young prince waved his hand and turned to look at Luo Xuan. He smiled and said,” Princess Luo Xuan, it’s been a few years since we last met, and your cultivation base has become even more profound. If this continues, I’m afraid that I won’t be your match in a few years!</p><p>you’re too kind, young lord. Everyone in the eternal devil nation knows of your talent. How can Luo Xuan be a match for you?”</p><p>Luo Xuan replied humbly.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The young Prince’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming. He was naturally curious about the fact that he could sit together with Luo Xuan.</p><p>However, when he took a closer look at Lu Ming, his face suddenly darkened.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. Just now, he had sensed a murderous intent from the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. It was their first time meeting each other.. Why would the other party want to kill him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
