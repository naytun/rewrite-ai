Many people were speechless. So Lu Ming still wanted to kill the great emperor.</p><p>this little guy is quite ambitious, but it’s not that easy to kill a great emperor unless you have an overwhelming advantage in power!</p><p>Emperor formless walked over with a smile.</p><p>Then, with a flash of light, uncle Kong appeared.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with concern.</p><p>Uncle Kong had not recovered from his serious injuries and he had just fought with the Emperor of tianluo. Lu Ming was worried.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m fine!”</p><p>Uncle Kong revealed a warm smile and returned to his old man state. If it wasn’t for the fact that everyone had seen uncle Kong fight, they would never have thought that he was a terrifying great emperor.</p><p>Uncle Kong didn’t stay for long. After exchanging a few words, he left.</p><p>After that, Emperor formless also left. They were all injured and needed to recover as soon as possible.</p><p>As for Huang Li, Huang Ling, Long Chen and the rest, they pulled Lu Ming along and set up a huge feast, euphemistically calling it a ‘celebration’. As they drank, they took out the image stone and watched Lu Ming beat up the he family Emperor.</p><p>In the next few days, there were people coming to the yuan mountain sacred Academy to visit Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that these forces wanted to befriend Lu Ming.</p><p>For example, the ancient yang sacred land’s purple flame villa and the only sacred Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming had the physical body of a Celestial Emperor and the combat power of an Emperor. He did not have to be afraid of the Daluo heaven sect. Of course, they were willing to make friends with him.</p><p>It was the same for some other powerful forces.</p><p>They naturally didn’t know that the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body couldn’t be used as and when they wanted to. It needed to store energy. They also didn’t know that the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body’s energy had been exhausted. Lu Ming did not reject anyone and met with the powerhouses from many forces.</p><p>If he befriended more forces, he would be of use in the future.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than half a month had passed.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor City was also in the midst of rapid restoration.</p><p>Since the last battle, the Heng family and the he family had restrained themselves and stopped invading other forces ‘territories. Many forces had been rebuilt.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had also left the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>He had just received the news that Vientiane tower had reopened and he immediately rushed over.</p><p>After entering the Vientiane tower, there was still someone who led Lu Ming to a room.</p><p>“What information do you want to know?”</p><p>An old man with snow-white hair asked.</p><p>1 want to ask if there is any way to condense a soul. 1 have a friend who is injured, and his soul is injured!</p><p>Lu Ming then described Qiu Yue’s symptoms in detail.</p><p>encountered a law of deprivation. Soul injured!</p><p>The white-haired old man frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in his mouth. If Vientiane tower did not know what to do, it would be troublesome.</p><p>After a while, the white-haired old man said,” “It’s extremely difficult to recover from an injured soul. Can you let me take a look at your friend?” “Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He waved his hand and the Dayan elixir furnace appeared.</p><p>“This is … The great Yan elixir furnace of the great Yan elixir Palace. Little fellow, you must be the son of chaos, Lu Ming, whose name shook the entire Mount Yuan!”</p><p>The white-haired elder was indeed an expert of Vientiane tower. He recognized the Dayan elixir furnace at a glance.</p><p>“It is this junior!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He opened the Dayan elixir furnace and Qiu Yue’s body floated out.</p><p>Every once in a while, Lu Ming would refine a batch of sacred elixirs into Qiu Yue’s body. Although it had been a long time, Qiu Yue’s face was still ruddy and normal. There was even a strong medicinal fragrance coming from Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>The white-haired old man waved his hand and a stream of energy flowed into Qiu Yue’s body. He began to observe her carefully.</p><p>A moment later, the white-haired old man retracted his power.</p><p>the damage to her soul is severe. According to what I know, there is only one place in the entire primordial realm that has a treasure that can allow her soul to gather and recover!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“What place? What kind of treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>As long as he could save Qiu Yue, he would find a way to get any treasure.</p><p>little fellow, it won’t be easy to use this treasure to save this little girl. That treasure is the National treasure of a Super Devil country in the land of myriad Devils, the eternal demonic coffin!</p><p>“The ancient demonic coffin?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>that’s right. The eternal demon coffin of the eternal demon nation is a rare treasure. It has an unimaginable effect on the soul. As long as this little girl is placed in the eternal demon coffin, her soul will be formed in less than a month!</p><p>however, the ancient demon coffin is the National treasure of the ancient demon nation. It’ll be extremely difficult to borrow it for a month!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists to thank the white-haired elder. He paid the consultation fee and put Qiu Yue back into the Dayan elixir furnace.</p><p>He had to make a trip to the ancient devil nation. The sooner, the better. The longer it took, the more disadvantageous it would be for Qiu Yue.</p><p>No matter how difficult it was, he had to help Qiu Yue recover.</p><p>After leaving Vientiane tower, Lu Ming returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy. He planned to bid farewell to everyone and leave for the land of ten thousand demons as soon as possible.</p><p>However, when he returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy, he heard the news that Emperor Wu Xiang was summoning all the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. It seemed like he had something to announce.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming stayed behind temporarily. He would only leave after the Emperor of notionless finished his announcement.</p><p>In the next few days, more and more geniuses returned to the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>However, the paragons of the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect did not come.</p><p>On the fifth day, Emperor formless gathered everyone at the place where he had given his Dao lecture.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had also arrived.</p><p>He discovered that there were a total of several hundred people here, but compared to before, there was a huge difference.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The void trembled, and Emperor formless’s figure appeared.</p><p>“Greetings, great emperor!”</p><p>Everyone saluted.</p><p>this time, 1 gathered all of you here because I have something important to announce. 1 believe everyone is very curious as to why tianhuo, huntian, and I established the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Emperor formless said.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This point was indeed the question in everyone’s heart, there are a few main reasons. One of them is related to the evil god tribe! the previous battle was only a regional battle. The evil god tribe has never given up on attacking the heaven realm and the primordial realm. Now, the situation in the heaven realm is very unfavorable. It’s only a matter of time before the evil god tribe attacks the primordial realm. Therefore, the final battle will break out sooner or later!</p><p>Emperor formless spoke with a heavy voice.</p><p>Everyone’s heart sank, and their faces turned grave.</p><p>After the battle with the evil god race, everyone understood how terrifying the evil god race was. However, that was only a battle of a small scale.</p><p>If a decisive battle were to break out, how could they fight when the enemy had a large number of great emperors, or even heavenly emperors?</p><p>At that time, it wouldn’t just be the yuan mountain. No one in the entire primordial realm would be able to stay out of it. They would probably all fall into a tragic battle.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. He had to become stronger, strong enough to protect his family and friends. He felt a sense of urgency..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
