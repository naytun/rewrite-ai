Silently, he merged the array Dao laws into the chaos laws.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of Lu Ming’s palm suddenly increased dramatically. With a single palm, it directly broke through Mu Yang’s void law.</p><p>Mu Yang’s face changed dramatically. His body trembled and he couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>“Your strength? How is that possible?”</p><p>Mu yang asked in shock.</p><p>How did Lu Ming’s strength increase so much all of a sudden? He was much stronger than before.</p><p>He could not tell that Lu Ming had fused two types of laws.</p><p>In the land of infinite demons, Lu Ming had stayed in the canyon in the demonic sea for more than two years. He challenged the levels and fought every day. He was already extremely familiar with the use of the laws.</p><p>&Nbsp; when he used several laws, he could use chaos laws to cover up the other laws.</p><p>Of course, if he used two ultimate maxims at the same time, he could not hide it because the ultimate maxims were too powerful.</p><p>However, when he used the strongest law and the king path law, he could cover it up very well, and others could not see it.</p><p>Therefore, Mu yang could not figure out how Lu Ming’s strength had increased so much.</p><p>The others around the fighting ring were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had suddenly exploded and forced Mu yang to retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming really hid his abilities when he fought with me previously!”</p><p>Yu He sighed, his eyes filled with dejection.</p><p>He had wanted to defeat Lu Ming in the battle of the ten lands. Now, it seemed that it would be very difficult.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>Monk wuchen chanted the name of Buddha.</p><p>The other children of God looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong and it was beyond common sense.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming let out a long roar and charged towards Muyang.</p><p>Every move of his contained the fusion of chaos laws and array Dao laws. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Furthermore, the array Dao laws were already perfect, so the power was even greater.</p><p>The fusion of nomological laws didn’t just increase the power of the fusion by one plus one equals two, but by several times. The more nomological laws were fused, the stronger the power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu yang clashed again, but this time, Mu yang was completely suppressed and was at a disadvantage. He was no match for Lu Ming. Every time they clashed, his body trembled violently, as if he had been hit by an ancient divine mountain.</p><p>His powerful Saint energy was useless.</p><p>“Impossible, how is that possible?”</p><p>Mu yang simply couldn’t accept it.</p><p>He had already started to develop a small world. Once the time was right, he would be able to break through to the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>He was already infinitely close to the Martial Emperor realm and was also the Son of God. He was much stronger than those who had just stepped into the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was only in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. He had yet to form a River with the Laws of Chaos. How could he be so powerful?</p><p>He could not believe it. He roared angrily and tried his best, but he was still suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“The ocean of nothingness!”</p><p>In the end, Mu yang used his strongest move.</p><p>This was a terrifying sacred art with boundless might. It exploded the might of the void law to the extreme, forming an ocean of the void law that enveloped everything and wanted to turn everything into nothingness.</p><p>In fact, many people would master more than one divine power after they became Emperor-to-be.</p><p>After becoming an Emperor-to-be, one’s nomological laws would reach perfection. When cultivating other divine powers, one could easily grasp them and raise their mastery to the extreme.</p><p>It was just like how Lu Ming cultivated the chaos Divine palm.</p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to have the corresponding sacred art.</p><p>The void sea was one of Muyang’s most powerful magical techniques.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>There seemed to be the sound of waves crashing. Lu Ming was enveloped in the sea of nothingness.</p><p>“Turn into nothingness!”</p><p>Mu yang roared, filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>At that moment, he no longer wanted to take the chaos Scripture from Lu Ming. Instead, he wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands had not started and he could not lose. If he lost, he would be even more defeated in the battle of the ten lands.</p><p>what a terrifying divine power. Lu Ming is in danger!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The void could not be controlled, and it turned into a vast ocean that enveloped an area. It was too terrifying. Many people could not help but worry for Lu Ming.</p><p>Muyang can be said to be the strongest seed in this battle of the ten lands. He is very likely to enter the top ten. When he explodes, his combat power is really amazing!</p><p>that’s right. In the past, Muyang was almost invincible in the divine land. There were only a few people in the younger generation who could defeat him!</p><p>Some people spoke.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue’s eyes were calm and she didn’t look worried at all.</p><p>Qiu Yue knew very well how powerful Lu Ming was when he went all out.</p><p>As for split, he had seen Lu Ming in action before. He knew that Lu Ming had not used his full strength yet.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Muyang stood above the void sea, his eyes cold. He kept activating the void law to make sure that Lu Ming was turned into nothingness.</p><p>But the next moment, Mu Yang’s expression changed.</p><p>The void sea began to shake as if a giant beast was stirring the wind and clouds.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, a huge finger, like the finger of a God, rushed out of the sea of nothingness.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, from every corner of the void Ocean, the chaotic fingers of tribulation shot out continuously. The void Ocean turned into a honeycomb, and then, with a violent boom, it completely exploded.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Mu yang roared in disbelief. His body trembled and he was forced to retreat, blood flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Kill!”</p><p>The sea of nothingness disappeared and Lu Ming’s figure reappeared. He was unharmed. He shouted and charged at Mu yang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s huge hand pressed down and Mu yang was already injured. He was no match for Lu Ming and was sent flying dozens of meters away. He spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely behind, not giving Mu yang any chance to catch his breath. He launched a storm of attacks at Mu yang.</p><p>Mu yang was already injured and was no match for Lu Ming. After exchanging a few moves with Lu Ming, he felt that his arm was about to be broken and he spat out blood continuously.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, he could not block it and was struck in the chest by Lu Ming’s palm. His chest caved in and almost exploded into a big hole.</p><p>If not for his powerful nomological law light and shocking defense, his body would have exploded from this move.</p><p>But even so, he was still lying on the ground, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. He had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>you want to take the chaos Scripture from me with your strength? let Yuan Xin do it herself!</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at Muyang and spoke coldly, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>Mu yang was so furious that he wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you, I’ve been investigating you for a long time. You have many friends in Mount Yuan. Right now, a few of them are ‘guests’ in my Mu family. You’d better hand over the chaos Scripture and come with me to the MU family. Otherwise, all your friends will die!”</p><p>Mu yang suddenly spoke in a cold voice. Of course, it was a voice transmission.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>Could it be that someone had fallen into the hands of the MU family? it was possible. After he had arrived at the divine fate land, he had not seen Long Chen, Huang Li, and the others..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
