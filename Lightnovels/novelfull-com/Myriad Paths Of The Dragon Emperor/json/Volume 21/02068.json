The death law was actually spreading out from his hand.</p><p>Although it was very weak and only had a trace of aura, it was enough to shake the entire world if it were to spread.</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also shocked and dumbfounded. He took a long time to react.</p><p>He seemed to have mastered the law of death!</p><p>Previously, in the ancient city, Lu Ming was chased by the Gang Demon King and rushed into the magma. His body was burned and turned into ashes.</p><p>From a certain perspective, Lu Ming had really fallen and was facing death.</p><p>That experience gave Lu Ming a deep understanding of death.</p><p>After that, he had been busy absorbing energy for Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body and didn’t have the time to sense it carefully.</p><p>It wasn’t until he fought the middle-aged man with all his strength that his attacks actually contained a trace of the death law.</p><p>This was an unbelievable thing.</p><p>It was true that those below the rank of martial Supreme could only comprehend one law. However, Lu Ming had cultivated the Twin forbidden spell and fused his main body with his secondary body. He had cultivated two Saint hearts and could control two laws.</p><p>After that, when he was on the verge of death in the lava, the two Saint hearts had fused, causing the two laws to also merge.</p><p>It was already unbelievable that someone below the rank of a martial Supreme could control two types of nomological laws and even fuse them together. It would shock countless people if he were to say it.</p><p>But compared to now, it was nothing.</p><p>The death Maxim was one of the ten ultimate maxims.</p><p>Moreover, out of the ten ultimate maxims, no two maxims could coexist. This was a truth that had never changed since ancient times.</p><p>Even if he had cultivated to the Martial Emperor realm, it was impossible for him to control two ultimate laws. A mountain could not accommodate two tigers.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had yet to reach the Martial Emperor realm, but he seemed to have mastered two ultimate maxims. Although the death Maxim was still extremely weak, he had indeed mastered it.</p><p>The two strongest laws coexisted!</p><p>If this were to spread out, it would scare people to death.</p><p>“Is it because of my Saint heart?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but guess.</p><p>His Saint heart was too special. It was transformed from the Twin forbidden spell.</p><p>In history, even if someone had cultivated the forbidden twin spell and even two Saint hearts, he would still be a Saint.</p><p>However, no one was like Lu Ming, who had two Saint hearts merged together again.</p><p>The probability of this happening was too small.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s special Saint heart was able to contain many laws at the same time, even the ten ultimate laws.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Did this mean that he would be able to control more ultimate maxims in the future?</p><p>If he could control all ten ultimate maxims and merge them together, what would happen?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart could not help but beat wildly. He was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Then I’ll cultivate here for a while!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while before he took out the eternal demonic coffin and placed it on the ground. After taking a look at Xie nianqing, Lu Ming sat cross-legged beside the coffin and began to study the death law in detail.</p><p>As his comprehension deepened, a layer of death intent emanated from his body. Although it was extremely faint, it was indeed the death law.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating continuously for several days. His understanding of the law of death was slowly deepening. However, he had not even mastered half of it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already very satisfied. He knew that he had really mastered the law of death.</p><p>The same person could control two ultimate maxims at the same time. Even Lu Ming felt like he was dreaming.</p><p>the law of death is still too weak and not very powerful. When it’s more mature, it can even merge with other laws. How powerful will it be then? ”</p><p>also, I’ve already mastered three types of nomological laws. Can I master more?”</p><p>Lu Ming had already started to let his imagination run wild.</p><p>At his current realm, he naturally did not need to comprehend other nomological laws like when his cultivation was low. He could skip all these and directly comprehend nomological laws.</p><p>It was just like how a Martial Emperor would start to comprehend new laws directly from the laws when he tried to comprehend them.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming spent his time comprehending the death rule and trying to merge it with the other two rules.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Saint heart was really amazing. He tried to merge the laws and the process was very smooth.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming’s death Maxim had been cultivated to 10%. He could also fuse it with the chaos Maxim and the array Dao Maxim.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased a little.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing had not woken up for the past half a month.</p><p>This made Lu Ming a little anxious.</p><p>What if Xie nianqing doesn’t wake up?</p><p>Qiu Yue was still waiting for the ancient demonic coffin?</p><p>However, it was useless to be anxious. He could only wait.</p><p>Lu Ming collected his thoughts and continued to comprehend the death law.</p><p>&Nbsp; his mastery of the chaos laws and array Dao laws was already very high. It would be very difficult to improve.</p><p>However, he had just gained a preliminary understanding of the death rule. Back then, Lu Ming had experienced death in the lava. His understanding of the death rule was extremely fast.</p><p>&Nbsp; as time passed, his understanding of the death law became deeper and deeper.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the canyon for a month.</p><p>His mastery of the law of death had also reached 20%.</p><p>“I’ll go and try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the ancient demonic coffin and stepped forward.</p><p>When he arrived at a certain area, the middle-aged man appeared again.</p><p>There was nothing more to say. Lu Ming took action immediately.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength the moment he made his move.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used three types of laws together.</p><p>After all, the death Maxim was one of the ten ultimate maxims. When it was fused with the chaos Maxim, the explosive power was terrifyingly strong, as if some kind of qualitative change had occurred.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>After dozens of moves, Lu Ming defeated his opponent’s Saber Light with one move. He bombarded his opponent’s body and defeated him.</p><p>He had finally defeated the middle-aged man.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and continued to move forward. However, after moving forward for a while, Lu Ming had no choice but to stop.</p><p>That was because two figures had appeared in front of him. They were two middle-aged men.</p><p>When Lu Ming fought with the other party, he realized that the two middle-aged men’s combat strength was exactly the same as the previous one.</p><p>One of them was already very terrifying. With two of them attacking at the same time, Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage despite using all his strength. He was rather speechless and could only retreat.</p><p>it seems like I won’t be able to break out in a short period of time!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and then took out the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Just now, he noticed that Xie nianqing’s finger had moved.</p><p>Lu Ming would not be wrong!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Was Xie nianqing waking up?</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Xie nianqing. Indeed, not long after, Xie nianqing’s fingers moved again.</p><p>It didn’t take long before it moved again.</p><p>After a while, Xie nianqing let out an ‘mm’ and opened her eyes.</p><p>He saw Lu Ming the moment he opened his big, black eyes.</p><p>In the beginning, there was some confusion in his eyes, but then, it turned into endless joy.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s crisp voice came out of his mouth..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
