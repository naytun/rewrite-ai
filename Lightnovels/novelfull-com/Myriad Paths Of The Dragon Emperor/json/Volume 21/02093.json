It was definitely a terrifying expert, not an ordinary void Emperor.</p><p>Peak void Emperor!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming displayed extreme speed. His figure kept changing like a bolt of lightning. He was extremely fast as he dodged the sword light with all his might.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming dodged the sword gleam. However, the aftershock still hit Lu Ming. He grunted and his body flew far away.</p><p>In the air, Lu Ming coughed up large mouthfuls of blood. Just as he was about to land, Lu Ming struck out with his palm and the force of his palm hit the ground. Lu Ming borrowed the force and his figure drifted forward at an even faster speed.</p><p>A peak illusionary Emperor was undefeatable. He was too powerful and could kill Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming could only escape. It was a terrifying crisis.</p><p>Now, no one could help him. He could only rely on himself.</p><p>In the sky, a black-robed man wearing a Grim Reaper’s mask appeared. His body was filled with an extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>If one could see through the mask, one would definitely be able to see that this person’s face was cold and gloomy.</p><p>He looked around and saw the remaining assassins. His eyes were about to spit fire.</p><p>He had sent so many experts, all of whom were in the Martial Emperor realm, to assassinate a junior, a junior who was still in the Saint realm. Yet, he could not kill him and so many people had died.</p><p>If word of this got out, it would be a huge blow to the reputation of the death god nation.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had to die!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He swung his sword again, and a ray of sword light headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge, but it was even worse this time. He was grazed by the blade and his body was almost cut in half. There was a one-meter-long sword wound on his body. It was so deep that his bones could be seen and his internal organs could even be seen squirming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed did not slow down and he continued to rush forward.</p><p>In front of him, there was a large pit filled with white bones.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the sky, the masked expert saw that Lu Ming had not been killed after two consecutive moves, and his killing intent grew even colder.</p><p>In his hand, endless sword light bloomed, and hundreds of sword lights appeared in the sky.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Hundreds of sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>Hundreds of sword lights had completely sealed off Lu Ming’s escape route. This was a sure-kill move, cast by a peak illusionary Emperor. Lu Ming had no way of escaping.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of sword gleams hit Lu Ming and drowned him. A violent boom rang out in the area, bones flew everywhere, and dust flew up. After that, Lu Ming let out an indignant roar and there was no more movement.</p><p>When the dust settled, there was nothing left.</p><p>With a flash, a few black-robed men arrived and landed in this area. Above them, the expert wearing the Grim Reaper’s mask also stepped through the air and descended.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Is He Dead?”</p><p>he must be dead. Under Daren’s attack, not even his bones were left!</p><p>The black-robed men spoke one after another.</p><p>The expert wearing the Grim Reaper’s mask scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense and even penetrated deep into the ground, but he didn’t find anything unusual.</p><p>Then, he stretched out his hand, and a storage ring flew out from the skeleton and landed in his hand.</p><p>There were bloodstains on the storage ring. He sensed it and knew that it was Lu Ming’s aura.</p><p>Lu Ming should be dead. His bones have fused with the other bones here, leaving only a storage ring!</p><p>The expert wearing the Grim Reaper’s mask spoke.</p><p>He was very confident that with Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he would definitely die under that move.</p><p>At that moment, it was impossible for Lu Ming to escape. There was only one explanation. Lu Ming was already dead, not even his bones were left.</p><p>The storage ring was a good explanation.</p><p>this kid is really a freak. He’s too terrifying to be able to control two ultimate maxims!</p><p>fortunately, Your Excellency came in time. Otherwise, if this kid escaped, it would be troublesome!</p><p>The other black-robed men flattered him.</p><p>“He’s indeed a freak. Alright, let’s hurry up and leave. The news here will soon spread out. I’m afraid the experts of destiny city will soon arrive!”</p><p>also, spread the news that we killed the son of chaos in two days. It will definitely shock the world!</p><p>The masked man said coldly. Then, with a flash of his body, the assassins disappeared.</p><p>Ten miles away, in a hidden mountain Valley, Lu Ming coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood, his face pale.</p><p>Naturally, he did not die.</p><p>“This time, it’s all thanks to little Qing’s scapegoat demon puppet!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Just now, when he was about to be drowned by the sword light, he decisively used the scapegoat demon puppet that Xie nianqing gave him.</p><p>The scapegoat demon puppet was incomparably mysterious. In an instant, his body was transported ten miles away. The other party’s attack was all borne by the scapegoat demon puppet.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not die. The demon puppet was the one who died.</p><p>The demon puppet had died for him once!</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming even left a storage ring behind.</p><p>However, even so, Lu Ming was still swept by the aftermath and a few more sword wounds appeared on his body. Waves of destructive power continued to drill into the depths of his body.</p><p>these people think that 1 am dead. It is not good for me to appear now. I will change my identity and recuperate here. 1 will appear when the battle of the ten lands starts.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>If he appeared now, who knew if the other party would send someone to assassinate him again? he didn’t have any more scapegoat demon puppets now.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine breath spell and concealed his aura. He then went deep into the ancient battlefield and found a hidden place. He entered the mountain and river diagram and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>His injuries were very serious, and there were destructive sword lights in his body. In order to destroy his body and heal his injuries, he had to first get rid of the destructive sword lights.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the four types of laws and began to eliminate the destructive sword gleam.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed. Lu Ming had finally gotten rid of the destructive sword gleam.</p><p>As soon as the destructive sword light was removed, Lu Ming’s body began to recover rapidly. His bones, bones, and muscles regenerated and were healing rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread out, shaking the entire divine land.</p><p>Lu Ming, the son of chaos from Mount Yuan, was killed by the death god nation in the city of Destiny.</p><p>The moment this news was released, the world was in an uproar. Countless people were shocked.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came to the divine fated land, he had displayed his terrifying talent and combat strength. He was a perfected ultimate Saint and had defeated several sons of heaven. Even Mu yang, who was known as a seed expert, had been defeated by Lu Ming and trampled under his feet.</p><p>At first, many people thought highly of Lu Ming. They felt that he was the top expert in the battle of the ten lands and a seed expert. Countless people were looking forward to the battle between Lu Ming and Yuan Xin, the son of chaos in the divine land.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was killed by the death god nation.</p><p>This was because this news was released by the death god nation.</p><p>The death god nation was very arrogant, and they announced to the outside world that so what if they were peerless geniuses? So what if he hid in destiny city? It was useless for the people that the death god nation wanted to kill to hide.</p><p>This was a blatant challenge to the Overlord force of the City of Destiny..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
