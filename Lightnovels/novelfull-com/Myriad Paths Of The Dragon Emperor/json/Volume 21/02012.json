A huge chaos finger of tribulation was formed, covered with array Dao runes.</p><p>The initial fusion of the annihilation scroll and the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger struck out, shattering he Qian’s blade light with unstoppable force.</p><p>He Qian’s expression changed drastically as he roared. A world seemed to emerge from his body as he slashed out with his blade. The blade light seemed to contain a world.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos finger tribulation was finally destroyed by he Qian, but he Qian’s figure was pushed back ten miles!</p><p>The Martial Emperor had been forced to retreat by Lu Ming!</p><p>Many people gasped and were too shocked to speak.</p><p>He was only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm, but he was able to defeat a Martial Emperor. No one would believe this.</p><p>This kind of battle result could scare people to death!</p><p>“All, damn it!”</p><p>He Qian roared. He had lost all his face today. Even if he could kill Lu Ming, it would become a stain in his life and even a demon in his heart.</p><p>“This is the he clan’s martial sovereign? Just this little bit of combat power? As expected, he’s worse than a pig or a dog. Not only does he have a bad character, but his combat strength is also poor!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He Qian was so angry that his chest heaved up and down, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>calm down. He’s provoking you on purpose. Use all your strength to kill him and wash away your shame!</p><p>A voice entered he Qian’s ears.</p><p>It was the voice of the great emperor of the he clan.</p><p>The voice of the he clan’s great emperor seemed to have a magical power that calmed he Qian’s heart.</p><p>He understood that he had been too impatient just now and had not used all of his combat strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A saber appeared in his hand. The saber radiance pierced through the air and was extremely sharp.</p><p>With the infusion of he Qian’s world power, the saber’s might grew stronger and stronger. The terrifying saber aura continued to press toward Lu Ming. This was a monarch weapon!</p><p>The power of a sovereign weapon controlled by a Martial Emperor was completely different from that of someone under the Martial Emperor realm. Only a martial sovereign could unleash the full power of a sovereign weapon. BOOM!</p><p>A world was floating above he Qian’s body. This world clearly hadn’t finished its evolution. It was filled with chaos, but it still gave people a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He Qian shouted and slashed down with his saber.</p><p>The power of this blade was much stronger than before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He circulated his cultivation to the extreme and pointed his finger.</p><p>It was still destruction. Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>However, this time, the finger of tribulation of chaos was shattered when the saber-light slashed down. A terrifying force rushed toward Lu Ming, forcing him to retreat rapidly.</p><p>this is the true strength of a Martial Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed the boiling blood in his body and muttered in his heart.</p><p>His strength was still slightly inferior to a Martial Emperor’s.</p><p>If he could reach the perfected absolute Saint realm, he would be confident of fighting he Qian.</p><p>“It seems that Lu Ming is still no match for them!”</p><p>a Martial Emperor is a Martial Emperor, after all. Lu Ming is only at the peak of the absolute Saint realm. The difference is too great!</p><p>“However, it’s already terrifying enough that Lu Ming can fight a martial Supreme to this extent.”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Lu Ming, 1 won’t let you die so easily. I’ll let you die from pain!</p><p>He Qian approached Lu Ming step by step, his cold voice ringing in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“I was just playing with you earlier. Now, 1 can send you on your way!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled faintly and a murderous intent burst out from his eyes.</p><p>Just now, he had fought with all his strength just to test his limit.</p><p>Many people were stunned!</p><p>What did Lu Ming mean by this? Could it be that he wanted to kill he Qian?</p><p>“Send me on my way? Hahaha, you’re really shameless. You want to anger me with this, right? unfortunately, I can’t let you have it. Kill!”</p><p>die! he Qian shouted. His body burst with brilliant light. His entire person seemed to have fused with the saber in his hand, turning into a terrifying Saber Light that charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The saber Light tore through the air and the space howled. It was terrifying and shocking!</p><p>Many people’s hearts were in their throats.</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming was going to die under this knife!</p><p>In an instant, the saber Light approached Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At this moment, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others were shocked.</p><p>At that moment, the powerhouses of Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, ice curtain, and the others wanted to help.</p><p>However, the powerhouses of the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect flashed and blocked their way.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shouted and wanted to rush over, but one of the experts on the other side burst forth with energy, and Lu Xiangxiang’s figure was sent flying.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that Lu Ming was going to be killed by this slash, they saw a sword gleam.</p><p>Sword-light shone from Lu Ming’s hands and slashed at the saber-light that he Qian had transformed into.</p><p>Then, an unbelievable scene appeared.</p><p>The sword light slashed and the saber Light was cut in half.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The saber Light broke and shattered. Then, everyone saw he Qian’s figure retreating frantically. He retreated a hundred miles away, his eyes wide open as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu… Ming!”</p><p>He Qian spat out these two words with difficulty. Then, a line of blood appeared between his eyebrows and quickly spread to his entire body.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>He Qian’s body was split into two and fell to the ground.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>He Qian was dead!</p><p>The scene fell into a deathly silence.</p><p>Just now, he Qian clearly had the absolute advantage and was about to kill Lu Ming with one slash. Everyone thought that Lu Ming was in grave danger. But why was he Qian the one who died?</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s sword! You can actually control the celestial Emperor’s sword!</p><p>One of the Heng family’s true emperors shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming was holding a stone sword in his hand!</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s sword!</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled!</p><p>Lu Ming could actually control the celestial Emperor’s sword and unleash its power, killing he Qian with one strike.</p><p>How could a mere absolute Saint control the celestial Emperor sword and exert its power?</p><p>Naturally, they did not know that Lu Ming had the cultivation technique to control the celestial Emperor’s body. The celestial Emperor’s sword had fused with the celestial Emperor’s body. Now, the energy stored in the celestial Emperor’s body had reached twelve percent. If Lu Ming could control the celestial Emperor’s body, he could naturally control the celestial Emperor’s sword as well.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had controlled the celestial Emperor’s sword and easily killed he Xiao.</p><p>“Who else wants to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming held the stone sword and glanced at the he family, the Heng family, and the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>Humph, you’re just an absolute Saint. Do you think you’re invincible just because you can barely use a trace of the power of the celestial Emperor’s sword? the celestial Emperor’s sword should belong to the Heng family. Hand it over!</p><p>An expert from the Heng family stepped out, and his terrifying aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A martial Supreme! This person was also a small emperor void Emperor!</p><p>However, this person’s aura was many times stronger than he Qian’S. He was probably an expert even among the void emperors.</p><p>“If you want the celestial Emperor’s sword, then come and take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming held his sword and faced the powerful man from the Heng family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>From a distance, the Heng family’s powerhouse reached out his palm and grabbed at Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
