It was a sect formed by many experts who were profound in puppetry. They emphasized mutual exploration and the idea of common progress. Therefore, relatively speaking, the shenxiao sect was very free.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue and di Kai to the shenxiao sect, but no one cared.</p><p>“What a wondrous puppet!”</p><p>Walking within the shenxiao sect, Qiu Yue exclaimed.</p><p>Inside the shenxiao sect, all kinds of puppets could be seen everywhere. There were beast-shaped ones, human-shaped ones, and some human-shaped ones, which were almost exactly the same as humans.</p><p>These puppets were helping the shenxiao sect with various matters, such as mining, refining, and even planting spiritual herbs and sacred medicines.</p><p>There were many things that didn’t need to be handled by people, and were directly handed over to the puppets.</p><p>I heard that when the puppetry technique is cultivated to the highest level, it can allow the puppet to gain sentience and become no different from a living being. That’s truly wondrous!</p><p>Chu Kai sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He thought of Earth One, gold one, and the others in the chaos Hall. Weren’t they puppets? they were no different from normal living beings.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue would stay in the shenxiao sect for the time being. There were some places in the shenxiao sect that could help people comprehend the puppetry.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around the shenxiao sect, comprehending the puppet technique.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t put all his energy into puppetry. His own cultivation was the most important.</p><p>Puppeteering only required a little bit of proficiency.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming’s puppetry technique had improved greatly. He could now control a few powerful puppets with his soul power.</p><p>This way, it was almost enough.</p><p>Today, di Kai found Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. He told Lu Ming that in a few days, there would be two powerful sons of heaven fighting on the ancient Emperor stage.</p><p>These two sons of God were also the sons of death!</p><p>“Two children of death?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>now, the paragons from all over the world have poured into the divine land. In addition to the paragons of the divine land itself, the number of paragons is truly as high as the clouds. It has reached an unprecedented level and is extremely brilliant!</p><p>the battle of the ten lands hasn’t started yet. The paragons of the various lands are wandering around the land of divine destiny. From time to time, there will be clashes. The battles between the paragons happen often, especially those who control the same law. They all want to surpass each other and become the only one. The battle is even more intense!</p><p>Chi Kai explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was inevitable. Moreover, before the battle in the ten lands, he could feel out his opponent’s strength so that he would have an idea of what to do.</p><p>“The battle between the two sons of God has attracted a large number of heaven’s favorites. Do you want to go and take a look?”</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Now that he had comprehended the death law, he might be able to gain some insights by watching the battles between the other children of death.</p><p>Also, he was very curious about who the two children of death were.</p><p>He had seen two children of death before. One was the death blade, and the other was GE long from the land of myriad demons.</p><p>Was it the two of them?</p><p>Perhaps there were others who had mastered the law of death?</p><p>They immediately set off.</p><p>The ancient Emperor stage was a two-day journey away from here. The battle was scheduled for three days later. They didn’t want to waste any time, just in case they couldn’t make it.</p><p>Two days later, they arrived at a small city near the ancient Emperor stage and rested there for a night. On the second day, it was the day of the battle between the two children of death. They then headed towards the ancient Emperor stage.</p><p>When they arrived, the place was already packed with people.</p><p>At a glance, many of them were young heaven’s pride experts, and there were also some of the older generation.</p><p>All of them were standing around a platform.</p><p>This platform looked extremely ancient and was filled with the marks of time. This was the ancient Emperor platform. According to the legends, there were ancient heavenly emperors who comprehended Dao here.</p><p>This platform was sturdy and immortal, and it had also become the place where many powerhouses fought.</p><p>Around the platform, there were nine stone pillars that pierced through the sky, giving off a feeling of superiority.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the crowd and he found a few familiar faces.</p><p>For example, Wei Tiandao and the others were all geniuses of the yuan mountain. Back then, they had cultivated together in the yuan mountain sacred Academy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed and rushed up to one of the nine stone pillars. He stood on top of the stone pillar and looked down on everyone.</p><p>“Who is this person? You dare to stand on the gazing Emperor pillar with such confidence?”</p><p>could it be that he’s a Son of God? if not, he’ll definitely be beaten into a pig head!</p><p>Some people cried out in surprise, while others sneered gloatingly.</p><p>Lu Ming understood the meaning of the gazing Emperor pillar after the explanation.</p><p>He was not looking at any ordinary martial sovereign, but the heavenly Sovereign!</p><p>Stepping onto the gazing-the-Emperor pillar represented talent, potential, and status.</p><p>Only the strongest heaven’s favorites could stand on top of the pillar. If an ordinary person stepped on it, they would definitely be thrown off.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, another figure stepped onto the gazing Emperor pillar. This was a handsome young man wearing a purple and gold robe, and his face was filled with cold arrogance.</p><p>that’s Zi liusu. He only has a King body. Although I’ve heard that he has cultivated the light of laws and is very powerful, I’m afraid he’s not strong enough to stand on the Emperor-gazing pillar.</p><p>that’s right. Just watch. Someone is definitely going to make a move!</p><p>Seeing the purple-and-golden-robed young man fly up the Emperor-gazing pillar, the surrounding people began to discuss.</p><p>Just as the crowd was discussing, a young man in a black robe appeared in the air. Step by step, he walked toward Zi liusu, and his powerful aura crushed toward Zi liusu.</p><p>“A mere king physique and you want to step onto the gazing Emperor pillar? get the hell out!”</p><p>The black-robed young man said indifferently, and the aura on his body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to make me go down!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Zi liusu said coldly. A terrifying aura erupted from his body as a beam of light spread out and covered his entire body. Not only that, but there was also a purple river that danced around him, making him look like a god.</p><p>“Light of law, River of law!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>As expected of the geniuses from all over the world. There were too many geniuses in the divine destiny land.</p><p>This Zi liusu was definitely powerful. He had a peerless King body and had already reached the Emperor-to-be realm. He had also cultivated the light of laws. In the past, when it was rare for a child of heaven to appear, he would definitely be a heaven’s favorite who could suppress the world.</p><p>If the Son of Heaven didn’t appear, who could compete with him? even in the golden age, he was still a top-notch genius.</p><p>However, the black-robed young man’s expression remained calm. There was even a hint of disdain as he said,” “If you don’t get lost, then I’ll make you get lost!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The space seemed to tremble, and six pitch-black vortexes suddenly appeared behind the black-robed young man.</p><p>The vortex kept spinning, as if it was trying to suck people’s minds in.</p><p>“The six paths of reincarnation, it’s the law of reincarnation!”</p><p>“This is a child of Samsara!”</p><p>I know who he is! It’s Yu He! He’s Yu He, the peerless genius of the divine destiny land!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This person was also a Scion of Samsara, just like Ouyang Moli.</p><p>If this person were to encounter Ouyang Moli, there would probably be a battle.</p><p>The moment Yuhe’s law of reincarnation appeared, Zi liusu’s expression turned ugly-</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
