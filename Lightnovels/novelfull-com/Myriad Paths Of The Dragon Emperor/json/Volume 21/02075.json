Instead, they were teleported to a place close to Mount Yuan. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue flew to Mount Yuan.</p><p>Half a month later, they finally returned to ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>The great Yan elixir Hall was completely empty. Uncle Kong wasn’t present.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the Phoenix Palace to ask for information. He learned that the Phoenix Palace Master had already brought some people to the divine land.</p><p>He also learned that Huang Ling, Long Chen, Huang Li, and the others had all ended their seclusion and were heading towards the divine fated land.</p><p>However, the other party told him that the sons of God should still be in seclusion, but the great emperors would send them to the divine land.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the few sons of God should be bubbles, Ouyang Moli, and Xiangxiang.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have to head to the divine fated land too!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Some of them had already gone to the divine land, and the great emperors would send some of them over, so he didn’t need to worry.</p><p>After resting for two days in Gu Yue sanctuary, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue set off for the divine fated land.</p><p>It was impossible to go to the divine land directly by the teleportation formation, because it was too far and there were special reasons. The two of them went through several teleportations and arrived at the edge of the yuan mountain.</p><p>The divine land was located in the middle of the yuan continent and it was very special.</p><p>Because he was surrounded by the ring sea.</p><p>It was as if a piece of land had been smashed down by an incomparably huge ring, piercing through the earth. That ring had become a ring sea, and the part inside the ring was the divine land.</p><p>Apart from the barren lands of the endless islands, the other eight lands were all on the outskirts of the ring sea. They surrounded the divine land.</p><p>The divine land was undoubtedly the largest, most vast, and most powerful region among the ten lands of the primordial realm.</p><p>It was said that the divine land was the total area of the other eight lands, excluding the forsaken land. One could imagine how large the divine land was.</p><p>The divine land was filled with outstanding people and all kinds of races. There were many sects and ancient clans, and countless forces.</p><p>The desolate race, in the distant past, was also a powerful ancient race in the divine fated land.</p><p>With such prosperity, there were naturally countless geniuses.</p><p>Especially now that it was the golden age, no one knew how many geniuses had been born in the divine land.</p><p>There were probably many top-notch sons of heaven.</p><p>This time, the battle of the ten lands would be held in the city of Destiny in the land of the divine fate.</p><p>In other places, if one wanted to go to the divine land, they had to pass through the ring sea.</p><p>However, the ring sea was too wide, and the environment was extremely harsh. On the ring sea, terrifying gales, raindrops, and lightning were commonplace.</p><p>There were even some regions where space was extremely unstable, with terrifying spatial rifts and void storms appearing.</p><p>It was too difficult and dangerous to fly across the ring sea.</p><p>Therefore, some powerful forces in the divine land developed a kind of warship that could travel across the sea. These warships knew some special routes to avoid danger.</p><p>Ordinary people who wanted to cross the ring sea and head to the divine land would have to take this kind of warship, so they naturally had to pay a huge amount of raw gemstones.</p><p>This was also how the forces in the divine land earned raw gemstones.</p><p>Especially during this period, countless people from other regions had gathered around the ring sea to head to the divine fate land. Every time the cross-sea battleships arrived, it would be full.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue arrived at a big city near the ocean. After asking around, they went to the ocean.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Huge waves surged into the sky, deafening the ears.</p><p>From a distance, the waves that were hundreds of meters high were hitting the coastline one after another.</p><p>In the middle of the sea, there were a few huge ships.</p><p>There were a few cross-sea battleships, each of which was tens of thousands of meters long and thousands of meters tall.</p><p>The dense crowd boarded the cross-sea warship.</p><p>The battle of the ten lands had never happened before in history. This was the first time.</p><p>Moreover, it was the golden age now, and the overwhelming prodigies were appearing frequently. The peak confrontation would take place in the divine fated land, which attracted too many people.</p><p>Just Mount Yuan alone would have sent countless people into the land of divine destiny.</p><p>Every day, a large number of people would board the cross-Sea Battleship and head toward the divine land.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue chose one at random. They paid a large number of raw stones and boarded a cross-sea warship.</p><p>The cross-Sea Battleship was very large. It had many floors and many rooms. Everyone who boarded the battleship would be assigned a room.</p><p>The two of them entered the room to cultivate and waited.</p><p>A few days later, the battleship began to move and set off for the divine land.</p><p>After the warship was activated, countless people rushed out of the rooms and came to the deck.</p><p>The scenery around the ocean was magnificent and full of wondrous sights. Many people who were here for the first time naturally did not want to miss it. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also came to the deck and looked around.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The huge battleship braved the wind and waves, heading in the direction of the divine land at an amazing speed. Soon, it left the yuan mountain and entered the vast ring sea.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>In the distance, there was a violent storm and lightning that cut through the void as if it wanted to split the sky.</p><p>However, a light shield rose on the ship, blocking the rain and wind.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>Not long after, they saw a huge creature appear on the surface of the sea. It was a sea beast, and it was extremely huge.</p><p>Although the environment around the ring sea was harsh, there were still some sea beasts that lived there, and their strength was also very shocking.</p><p>Qiu Yue was very curious. She pulled Lu Ming and looked around, chattering non-stop.</p><p>The journey to the divine fated land would take about half a month. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were not in a hurry to cultivate. It was a good time to relax.</p><p>In the demonic sea, in order to cross the canyon, Lu Ming had been cultivating every day. He had been jumping very tightly. Now was a good time to relax.</p><p>He stood on the deck and looked at the endless sea, feeling broad-minded.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed.</p><p>“More sea beasts have appeared, and there are quite a number of them!”</p><p>“Strange, I’ve been encountering sea beasts a lot recently!”</p><p>I’ve heard from other experienced people that although there are sea beasts in the surrounding ocean, due to the harsh environment, there are not many of them. Usually, we would only encounter them by chance. However, we’ve encountered many of them these days, many of which are in groups!</p><p>“It is indeed strange!”</p><p>Some people were discussing and felt that it was a little strange, but they didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed.</p><p>“Look, what’s that?”</p><p>not good! Those are sea beasts! There are so many sea beasts!</p><p>what? ” someone cried out in alarm. A dense group of sea beasts had appeared in front of the cross-sea warship, blocking its way. This forced the cross-sea warship to stop.</p><p>Then, more sea beasts emerged from the sea around the cross-sea warship. The sea-crossing warship was surrounded by a dense number of sea beasts. Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>On the warship, the sound of drums rang out. This was an alarm, indicating that they had encountered danger..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
