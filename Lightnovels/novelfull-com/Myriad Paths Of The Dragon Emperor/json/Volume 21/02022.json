How old did he look? how strong could he be? How can he be stronger than an Emperor-to-be? let’s attack together and destroy his cultivation. I want him to kneel in front of me and beg for mercy like a dog!”</p><p>The young master roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as the young master finished speaking, his subordinates stepped forward one after another. Their powerful auras pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’s really seeking his own death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly.</p><p>He had wanted to continue controlling the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body to absorb the demonic Qi, but he had to stop now.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the celestial Thearch’s physical body was put away. Lu Ming stood up, and a powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>you’re only at the absolute Saint realm. Die!</p><p>An Emperor-to-be shouted coldly. His figure was like a bolt of lightning, rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He moved quickly, but Lu Ming was faster. He pointed his finger.</p><p>As this finger pointed out, a terrifying whistling sound rang out in the space, as if the space was about to be pierced.</p><p>All the attacks and defenses of the Emperor-to-be were fragile under this finger.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be was terrified when he saw Lu Ming’s finger enlarging in front of his eyes. He wanted to Dodge but he realized that it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s finger touched the man’s glabella. A terrifying force shot out and the man’s head was pierced through.</p><p>His soul was turned into ashes by this attack.</p><p>Not only that, but the finger force continued to shoot backward with a trace of blood, piercing through a few more people.</p><p>“Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss”</p><p>The rest of the people gasped and their expressions changed.</p><p>One move to kill an Emperor-to-be, such combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The young master roared madly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Everyone exploded. At least seven Emperor-to-be and some absolute Saints attacked. All kinds of attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, a Halo appeared on Lu Ming’s body. It was the light of chaos!</p><p>“This … This is the light of law!”</p><p>“Light of chaos, this person is the son of chaos! The son of chaos!”</p><p>Many people shouted in fear. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The young man they had randomly met here was actually the son of chaos and had even refined the light of chaos.</p><p>Lu Ming’s chaotic light surrounded him. The attacks around him had no effect on him as they were all blocked by the chaotic light.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and rushed toward the two Emperor-to-be, pointing two fingers in succession.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>These two Emperor-to-be followed in the footsteps of the previous emperor-to-be, being pierced by the finger force and dying here.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>“Young master, run!”</p><p>The rest of the people shouted in fear. They did not dare to continue fighting with Lu Ming.</p><p>The son of chaos, who had refined the light of laws, was too terrifying. It was impossible for them to be a match for him. If they stayed, they would only be met with death.</p><p>At this moment, the young master was already scared out of his wits. He was being pulled by an Emperor-to-be and was running away.</p><p>“All of you, stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. As his body flashed, he pointed his finger again and another Emperor-to-be was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was as fast as lightning. He could kill an Emperor-to-be with each attack.</p><p>An ordinary Emperor-to-be would be killed by Lu Ming in seconds.</p><p>The young master had brought a total of eight Emperor-to-be with him. In an instant, Lu Ming had killed seven of them. Only one was left, and he was running away with the young master.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming pointed dozens of fingers in an instant.</p><p>The entire sky was filled with finger shadows and finger forces.</p><p>The finger force swept across, and the remaining people fell one by one.</p><p>Since these people wanted to kill him, he did not show any mercy.</p><p>Moreover, these people seemed to have an extraordinary background. It was Lu Ming’s first time in the land of infinite demons. If he let these people go, they would definitely take revenge. It would be extremely disadvantageous to Lu Ming’s future plans!</p><p>Therefore, he could only kill!</p><p>One by one, the figures fell to the ground. Soon, only the young master and the Emperor-to-be were left.</p><p>At this moment, the young master’s face was as white as snow, without any color.</p><p>Although the Emperor-to-be had led him out of the cave, they were still intercepted by Lu Ming in the valley.</p><p>don’t kill me! I’m from the eternal devil nation! Killing me won’t do you any good!</p><p>The young master roared.</p><p>“It’s even worse for me if 1 don’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He pointed his finger and a huge chaos finger of tribulation formed, crushing toward the young master and the last Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The young man roared and unleashed his full power. He was an absolute Saint in the upper tier, and his spiritual body was a top-tier earth spiritual body. He was a rare heaven’s favorite.</p><p>On top of that, he even took out a monarch weapon to defend himself.</p><p>It was obvious that this person’s identity was not ordinary.</p><p>Then he shouldn’t be left alive!</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger crushed over. The two’s resistance was in vain, and they were reduced to dust.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he kept everyone’s storage rings.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming also kept the young master’s sovereign weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming then waited there for half an hour.</p><p>Half an hour later, the demonic origin fruit ripened. Lu Ming plucked the demonic origin fruit and soared into the sky, leaving the place.</p><p>He couldn’t stay here for long. Who knew if the other party’s forces would come here? anyway, the demonic Qi in the demonic pool had almost been absorbed.</p><p>The energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was close to four percent, which was a great harvest.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming flew at full speed toward the nearest medium-level devil Kingdom.</p><p>There should be a teleportation formation in a middle-rank devil Kingdom.</p><p>The land of myriad demons was vast and boundless, not any smaller than the yuan mountain. If they flew there, it would take an unknown amount of time.</p><p>After flying for a few more days, Lu Ming, who was flying, suddenly stopped.</p><p>That was because there was a purple-black Red light flying toward them at high speed.</p><p>Even from a distance, Lu Ming could see that it was a beautiful lady. She was wearing a tight-fitting purple dress, which revealed her hot figure.</p><p>She was a woman full of temptation.</p><p>But at this moment, this woman was a little panicked and was flying at high speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Behind the woman, streaks of light streaked across the sky, flying towards her.</p><p>It was obvious that this woman was being pursued.</p><p>At this moment, the beautiful lady also saw Lu Ming. She continued to fly toward him and said,”If you help me block those people behind me, I won’t mistreat you!”</p><p>Although he looked a little panicked, there was a hint of cold arrogance in his voice. To Lu Ming, it sounded as if he was being ordered to do something.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. His figure drifted backward and flew in another direction, distancing himself from the absolute beauty.</p><p>He was not related to this woman and he did not want to be a busybody.</p><p>“If you help me quickly, 1’11 definitely reward you handsomely. If you need anything, just tell me!”</p><p>The young woman called out anxiously when she saw Lu Ming retreating..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
