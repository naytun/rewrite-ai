At this moment, the two large words on the two fragments were shining brightly. They burst forth with a shocking suppressive force that pressed down on the evil god tribe’s martial sovereign.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s martial sovereign roared in fear.</p><p>He was already severely injured, but he struggled to get up and use all his remaining strength to block the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s martial sovereign raised both his hands and unleashed all his power. However, when his palms came into contact with the prison suppressing stele, his body shook violently and the fear on his face grew even more intense.</p><p>His body kept on exploding. In just a few breaths, the evil god tribe s martial sovereign’s body had completely exploded and turned into ashes, leaving behind only a storage bracelet and a battle axe.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and grabbed the storage bracelet.</p><p>The others heaved a long sigh of relief. It was impossible to say that they did not feel any pressure when facing a martial Supreme.</p><p>It was a good thing that the other party had been severely injured earlier, and his combat strength had been greatly reduced. Otherwise, even if they joined forces, they might not be his match.</p><p>After all, a Martial Emperor was still a Martial Emperor. Even if he was just a void Emperor, he was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s recover here first!”</p><p>After patrolling the valley, he did not find anything unusual. Lu Ming planned to recover here first and adjust his condition to the peak before returning.</p><p>Everyone nodded and sat down cross-legged to recover.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram and came to the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>For the past two months, every time Lu Ming killed the evil god tribe and obtained their crystals, he would fuse the energy of the crystals into the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>By now, the energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s body had exceeded ten percent. Lu Ming could now fully control the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>However, unless he had no other choice, Lu Ming would not use it easily. After using it, it was too difficult to accumulate so much energy again. It would require an astonishing amount of resources.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the evil god tribe s Martial Emperor’s storage bracelet. The next moment, a huge pile of crystals appeared on the ground.</p><p>there are indeed a lot of resources for Martial Emperor powerhouses!</p><p>Looking at the large pile of crystals, Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming circulated his cultivation technique. A large pile of crystals exploded and were absorbed by the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>After all the energy from the crystals had been absorbed, the energy stored in the celestial Emperor s corporeal body had reached twelve percent.</p><p>I wonder how powerful it will be if 1 control Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body now!</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>This was the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. The power that erupted was absolutely unimaginable.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out some rough stones, devoured them, and refined them to restore his condition to its peak.</p><p>When everyone’s condition had recovered to its peak, they returned to heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>During this period of time , the evil god tribe in heaven Empyrean city had basically been wiped out. Heaven Empyrean city had started a large-scale reconstruction, and the yuan mountain sacred Academy had already convened once again.</p><p>Alliance master, the reconstruction of the Wei family has begun. I’ll return to the Wei family first. If you’re free, come to the Wei family as guests!</p><p>We i Xian smiled.</p><p>alright, I hope the Wei family can rise again!</p><p>Lu Ming patted Wei Xian’s shoulder.</p><p>The Wei clan was originally a pretty good power in heavenly Emperor City, and they had a true Emperor in charge.</p><p>However, the location of the Wei clan was very close to the original heavenly Emperor mountain. Initially, when the evil god tribe had attacked, the Wei clan had been the first to bear the brunt.</p><p>In that battle, almost all of the Wei clan’s upper echelons were killed, and all of their great emperors were killed by the evil god race. The Wei clan was almost completely destroyed.</p><p>Only a few members of the Wei family were not in the family, so they survived.</p><p>For example, Wei Xian was in the yuan mountain sacred Academy, so he was fine.</p><p>Now, the remaining members of the Wei family were rebuilding the family.</p><p>After Wei Xian left, Lu Ming and the group strolled around the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor City had suffered a great battle and was severely damaged. Various historical sites had collapsed, and it was unknown how long it would take to repair it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud boom and a few figures were blasted out of a collapsed Hall.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? This is my Liu clan’s residence!”</p><p>One of them roared at the palace.</p><p>“It belongs to the Heng family in the future!”</p><p>let s go! a cold voice sounded. More than ten figures stepped into the air and appeared.</p><p>“The Heng family!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the eyes of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>During the war, the Heng family had disappeared. Now that they had won the war and the evil god race had been annihilated, the Heng family had immediately come out.</p><p>And from the looks of it, they seemed to want to invade the territory of other forces.</p><p>your Heng clan is simply despicable and shameless. Why didn’t you do anything when we were fighting against the evil god tribe? now that the battle is over, you’ve come out and even want to take over my Liu clan’s estate. Despicable!</p><p>In the Liu family, a young man shouted in anger.</p><p>how dare you insult my Heng family! You deserve to die!</p><p>An expert from the Heng family roared. A sword light burst forth and was about to slash at the young man from the Liu family.</p><p>The person from the Heng family was a perfected absolute Saint, so the young man from the Liu family couldn’t stop him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A fist force crossed the void and destroyed the sword light of the Heng family’s expert.</p><p>It was desolate li who had made his move. His eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>Who are you? how dare you interfere in the Heng family’s business? you’re looking for death!</p><p>The Heng family’s experts swept their gaze over the desolate power and then at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Suddenly, someone’s expression changed and said, ” “Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming!” it’s true that the Heng family is despicable and shameless. Can’t you let others say it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you sure you want to interfere in the Heng family’s business?”</p><p>One of rhe Emperor-to-be from the Heng family looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly took a step forward, and a violent pressure pressed down on the Heng family. The expressions of more than ren Heng family members changed drastically, and they were forced to retreat under the pressure.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with horror in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was becoming more and more terrifying. When an ordinary Emperor-to-be faced with Lu Ming, it was as if they were facing a behemoth. They could not even summon the will to resist.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from the Heng family left with his tail between his legs.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The few people from the Liu family thanked Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and did not say much. He left the place with desolate force and the rest.</p><p>He understood that he could only help the Liu family temporarily. Since the Heng family had returned and wanted to swallow the Liu family, the Liu family would definitely not be able to survive.</p><p>They continued to stroll around, but what they saw next filled them with righteous indignation.</p><p>Not only had the Heng family returned, but the he family had also returned.</p><p>These two overlords of the heavenly Emperor City, Emperor-level forces, possessed extremely powerful combat strength.</p><p>However, the two races were nowhere to be seen in the previous battle. Once the battle ended, the people from both races appeared.</p><p>The key was that both the Heng family and the he family were taking the opportunity to swallow up the territories of other forces.</p><p>In the past, the Heng clan and the he clan were enemies. The other powerhouses in the heavenly Emperor City were also very strong. When they joined forces, they could still compete with the two clans.</p><p>However, after the battle with the evil god tribe, many forces in the heavenly Emperor City had suffered heavy losses, and they were unable to fight against the Heng clan and the he clan.</p><p>PS: after changing the cover, do you think it looks better now or in the past?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
