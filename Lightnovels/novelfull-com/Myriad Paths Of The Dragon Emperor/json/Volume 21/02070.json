You’re not willing to?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice rang in her ears again.</p><p>“Of course I’m willing!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly replied. He would be a fool if he was unwilling. He immediately took action.</p><p>Soon, the sound of heavy breathing could be heard in the valley.</p><p>At this moment, they had completely forgotten themselves and only had each other in their eyes! This battle lasted for a full hour before it stopped.</p><p>Despite their high cultivation levels, they were still drenched in sweat. Xie nianqing lay in Lu Ming’s arms, hugging him tightly. He did not say a word and was unwilling to let go.</p><p>After a long time, a wooden figure suddenly appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand. It was black all over, like a doll.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is a scapegoat demon puppet. It can die once if you are in mortal danger. Take it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing passed the doll to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Scapegoat demon puppet, is it a scapegoat?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>There was actually such a treasure in the world. Wasn’t this equivalent to having an extra life? if this were to be spread out, it would probably cause a crazy fight because it was too precious.</p><p>this depends on the cultivation level. It is useless for those above the Martial Emperor realm to use the scapegoat demon puppet. Only those below the Martial Emperor realm will use it!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Little Qing, you can keep it for yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I still have some for myself, you can keep it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing stared at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>“Mm, that’s good!”</p><p>Since Xie nianqing still had more, Lu Ming did not reject and kept the magic puppet.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s hands started to move again. He only stopped after a while.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re so beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said gently.</p><p>“Have you said this to anyone else before?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s continue!”</p><p>“Didn’t 1 already come?”</p><p>“How is giving birth once enough?”</p><p>A gentle voice rang out, and the valley was filled with warmth.</p><p>They did not know how many rounds they fought. In the end, even with Lu Ming’s cultivation, he felt exhausted. He just lay down and fell asleep.</p><p>Xie nianqing was the same. He laid down beside Lu Ming and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming suddenly woke up from his sleep.</p><p>This was because he felt a cold killing intent engulf him. This was his instinctive vigilance. He circulated his Saint power and retreated far away. He took out a piece of clothing from his storage ring and put it on.</p><p>Then, he looked forward.</p><p>In front of her, Xie nianqing was wearing a long black dress. Her beauty was unparalleled.</p><p>However, at this moment, her eyes were extremely cold. They were filled with cold killing intent as she stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He was unfamiliar with the look in Xie nianqing’s eyes. Xie nianqing had never looked at him with such a look.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but ask as he stepped forward.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said in a cold voice. A dark demonic light emanated from her body and turned into a dark demonic sword. Her figure was like a fleeting shadow as she charged at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The pitch-black sword gleam slashed toward Lu Ming, aiming for his vital points.</p><p>“Little Qing, what are you doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. At the same time, he circulated his Saint energy and controlled the Laws of Chaos to form a defensive wall in front of him.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming’s shock, Xie nianqing’s demonic sword tore apart Lu Ming’s defensive wall. The defensive wall formed by the Laws of Chaos appeared to be very fragile under Xie nianqing’s sword radiance.</p><p>Lu Ming was very shocked.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s sword did not stop and continued to slash at Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>He was not just saying it. He really wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Xie nianqing was completely different from his passionate self yesterday.</p><p>Yesterday, Xie nianqing was passionate and gentle as he wanted to bear Lu Ming’s child.</p><p>But today, he had drawn his sword to kill Lu Ming. His killing intent was as cold as a knife.</p><p>nianqing, stop. What’s the matter? speak clearly!</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted and burst out the light of chaos at the same time. With a wave of his hand, the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele emerged and blocked in front of him.</p><p>The Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele was covered with chaotic laws and chaotic light, which had amazing defensive power.</p><p>However, when Xie nianqing’s sword radiance struck, the chaotic light trembled violently and was torn apart.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“This power…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s power didn’t contain any nomological power. Instead, it contained extremely condensed demonic power and extremely powerful offensive power.</p><p>This land of power was very similar to the power cultivated by the ancient devil.</p><p>Lu Ming had fought with the ancient devil before and he could clearly feel it.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s power was purer, more condensed, and more powerful than the ancient Devil’s power.</p><p>“Lowly ant, you dare to insult me? kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted. His killing intent was at its peak. Demonic light filled the air, and the sword radiance glowed as he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. His pupils contracted and he shouted,” “Who are you? You’re not little Qing!”</p><p>Xie nianqing would never use such a tone to call him a ‘lowly ant’.</p><p>However, the aura of the person in front of him was clearly Xie nianqing.</p><p>What was going on? Could it be that Xie nianqing was possessed?</p><p>“I’m Xie nianqing, Xie nianqing is me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly. The sword light did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength and cast a fusion of chaos laws, array laws, and even death laws to fight Xie nianqing.</p><p>At the same time, all sorts of thoughts were running through his mind.</p><p>that’s not right. Looking at the situation, it doesn’t seem like he has been possessed. What’s going on? ”</p><p>After being possessed, one’s soul would be destroyed and would lose its consciousness. However, Xie nianqing had his own consciousness, so it was impossible for him to be possessed.</p><p>“Could it be related to the ancient demonic coffin? But I’ve never heard of such a thing happening when using the ancient demon coffin. Could it be related to the power in little Qing’s body?”</p><p>Lu Ming was reminded of the power in Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>In the past, he had always felt that there was a terrifying power hidden in Xie nianqing’s body. In the past, Lu Ming had thought that it was because Xie nianqing had great potential.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, the situation was not right!</p><p>There was another person in the same situation, Xie nianjun!</p><p>Lu Ming could also sense a terrifying power lurking in Xie nianjun’s body.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming also recalled that the Xie nianjun now was very different from the Xie nianjun back in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Initially, Xie nianjun wanted to kill him. However, after they arrived in the yuan continent, Xie nianjun did not seem to have this intention. Instead, he wanted to cooperate with him..</p><p>Wanna gift the story?
