However, he did not leave the residence immediately. Instead, he circled the residence a few times before coming to a secret place. He cast the divine breath technique and transformed into a middle-aged man.</p><p>This middle-aged man was a guard in the Grand princess’s Manor.</p><p>The Ji family had asked the eldest Princess to kick him out of the eldest princess’s Manor. It was very likely that there were experts stationed outside the manor. As soon as he went out, he would probably be ambushed by them.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of the younger generation, but he couldn’t guarantee that the other party would send a great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a guard and swaggered out of the princess’s Manor. When he walked out of the manor, he sensed a few spiritual senses sweeping past him.</p><p>Two of them were terrifyingly powerful, and they were obviously great emperors.</p><p>However, they could not tell that Lu Ming had the divine breath.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and glanced at the Grand princess’s residence.”Eldest Princess, we will meet again very soon. 1 hope you won’t regret it!”</p><p>A faint smile hung on the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth. He then strode away.</p><p>The Grand princess’s residence was in the Western part of the capital of the youluo devil Kingdom. Lu Ming headed straight for the eastern part of the capital.</p><p>The eastern part of the capital was the territory of the Luo family.</p><p>The you family and the Luo family were the two great families that had founded the you Luo devil Kingdom.</p><p>Since the eldest Princess could not tolerate him, he could only go to the Luo family.</p><p>“The little princess of the Luo family, Luo Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>There was a strange phenomenon among the younger generation of the you family and the Luo family. The most outstanding geniuses of the two families were all women.</p><p>The most outstanding genius of the you family was the eldest Princess, you ning. She was the representative of the you family and the leader of the younger generation.</p><p>The leader of the Luo family’s younger generation was called Luo Xuan.</p><p>She was also an unparalleled beauty, just as famous as you ning. However, she was a few years younger than you ning, so everyone else called her little princess.</p><p>Lu Ming was going to seek refuge with Luo Xuan.</p><p>If you ning could introduce him to the imperial family of the eternal devil nation, Luo Xuan could do the same.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at a grand mansion.</p><p>This mansion was the little princess, Luo Xuan’s mansion.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming had already restored his original appearance.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Two burly men stopped Lu Ming at the main door.</p><p>“You two, I’m here to pay a visit to the little princess!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>of course I know you’re here to visit the little princess. Every day, many people come to visit the little princess. Kid, I advise you to stop thinking too much and leave quickly!</p><p>One of the burly men waved his hand and asked Lu Ming to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It turned out that the other party had thought that he was deliberately trying to get close to the little princess and wanted to woo her.</p><p>I’m here to be the little princess ‘guest elder. In 20 days, I’ll help the little princess achieve victory in the battle with the you family!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The two burly men were stunned. They looked at Lu Ming as if he was an idiot.</p><p>They had seen many people who came up with all sorts of reasons to get close to the little princess. They had also heard all sorts of weird reasons. However, it was their first time seeing someone who boasted shamelessly like Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, brat, you’re really boasting shamelessly. Help the little princess obtain victory? This reason of yours is quite fresh, but if you dare to fool the little princess, be careful of your little life!”</p><p>kid, we’ll let you go this time. Hurry up and leave!</p><p>The two burly men waved their hands repeatedly, signaling for Lu Ming to leave quickly.</p><p>“The two of you, you only need to inform me. What if, what if what 1 said is true? what if I can really help the little princess win? if you stop me from going to the eldest Princess” side and help the eldest Princess win, what will happen to you if the little princess finds out about this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was not angry and spoke calmly.</p><p>The two big men’s expressions changed.</p><p>Although they were certain that Lu Ming was just boasting.</p><p>But just in case!</p><p>If Lu Ming really had the ability to do so, he would join the eldest Princess ‘side in a fit of anger after being stopped by them. By then, he would help the eldest Princess achieve victory, and they would be sinners. The Luo family would not let them off.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and nodded silently.</p><p>It wasn’t a big deal to just pass on the message.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not have the real ability and was just bragging, someone would naturally deal with him.</p><p>alright, you wait here. I’ll go pass the message!</p><p>A burly man said, and then hurriedly ran in to pass on the message.</p><p>After a while, the burly man returned and said,” “The little princess wants to see you. Come with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the depths of the mansion with the burly man.</p><p>“Brat, you better have some real skills, or you’ll be miserable!”</p><p>The burly man reminded him on the way.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He looked calm and had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>The burly man was puzzled. Could it be that this kid really had the real deal?</p><p>The mansion was huge. After making a few turns, they arrived at a large hall.</p><p>There were only three people in the hall.</p><p>At the head of the hall sat a Woman in Black. She looked to be in her twenties.</p><p>The woman was extremely beautiful. She was even more beautiful than the eldest Princess, you ning.</p><p>At this moment, the lady was blinking her big eyes and sizing Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>A young man stood on each side of the woman. His eyes were like lightning as they stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Your subordinate greets the princess!”</p><p>The burly man saluted the woman.</p><p>“Yes, stand aside!”</p><p>The beautiful lady, who was also the little princess, Luo Xuan, waved her hand, but her gaze was fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>you said that you can help me defeat you ning and the you family? ”</p><p>Luo Xuan spoke, his voice clear and melodious.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Hey, I’m telling you, you’re not allowed to lie to me. If you’re lying to me, I’ll make you miserable, you know that?”</p><p>Luo Xuan had two canine teeth, and as he spoke, his two canine teeth were exposed, making him look quite cute.</p><p>Although she wanted to say it fiercely, it was a pity that she did not look murderous at all.</p><p>little princess, we’ll know if this kid has the ability after we try him. If he’s boasting shamelessly, I’ll throw him out and feed him to the dogs!</p><p>On the left, a young man in a purple robe said coldly. At the same time, he took a step forward and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Luo Xuan didn’t stop him. Instead, he looked on curiously.</p><p>kid, show me what you got. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance!</p><p>The purple-robed young man said coldly. He turned into a purple light and charged at Lu Ming. He waved his palm and a purple sword light cut through the void, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Absolute Saint in the great circle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This purple-robed young man had the cultivation of an absolute Saint in the great circle. Lu Ming could also tell that his spiritual body was a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body, which was even stronger than Ji Peng’s.</p><p>The purple-robed young man had used 90% of his power in this attack, which was very powerful.</p><p>However, there was still a faint smile on Lu Ming’s face, as if he had not seen the purple-robed youth’s attack.</p><p>“As expected, he’s a boastful person!”</p><p>On the right, another young man sneered.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming moved.</p><p>He stretched out a finger and tapped lightly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
