Boom! Boom!</p><p>The chaos stone plate kept shaking as it pressed down on the spatial passage.</p><p>With a final boom, the chaos stone disc was completely embedded into the void passageway, as if it had fused with space!</p><p>The void passage was completely sealed.</p><p>“Damn it, all of you are going to die!”</p><p>The demon spirit religion master roared madly, and a terrifying power continued to attack Emperor formless.</p><p>The other evil god race’s great emperors also unleashed their terrifying attacks. Their attacks were frenzied, as though they had gone mad.</p><p>With the void passageway sealed, it was equivalent to cutting off their source of soldiers. The evil god race that was left in heavenly Emperor City would be wiped out sooner or later.</p><p>you’ve lost. You’re destined to fail!</p><p>The Holy Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“Failure? what a joke. So what if you seal the passage? Other than you great emperors, who else can stop us? we’ll kill everyone below the great emperor level, especially a heaven’s pride expert like you!”</p><p>The demon spirit religion Master’s Voice was incomparably cold, and it was filled with a terrifying killing intent. As he finished speaking, his cold eyes swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a slight chill in his heart.</p><p>Indeed, the other party still had seven great emperors. This was a huge disaster.</p><p>If the other party went into hiding and avoided the great emperors of the yuan mountain to hunt down those below the great emperor level, no one would be able to stop them. They would all die.</p><p>The great emperors of Mount Yuan couldn’t stay together every day. If they were separated, they would be attacked by the other party and even the great emperors would die.</p><p>It was too dangerous for the seven great emperors to attack without any hesitation.</p><p>“You don’t stand a chance!”</p><p>Huntian Emperor, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke. Then, he opened his palm and a door of light appeared.</p><p>The moment this light door appeared, it instantly enlarged into a giant door that was 10000 feet tall. A terrifying suction force erupted from the light door.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>let’s go! huntian great emperor said as he poured his power into the light door. The light door exploded with even more power, engulfing the seven great emperors of the evil god tribe and trying to devour them.</p><p>damn it, it’s the gate to the heaven realm. They want to take us to the heaven realm!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The evil god race’s Emperor Lord roared and tried his best to charge out.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>At this moment, the notionless Emperor, the Holy Emperor, the Emperor-like Emperor, and uncle Kong were all using their full battle-power to keep their opponents busy.</p><p>Lu Ming was enveloped by uncle Kong’s energy and he was behind uncle Kong.</p><p>He could not interfere in such a great battle at all.</p><p>damn it, Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is only 10% away. 1 can’t control it at all!</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with hatred and could not wait to help.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The light door trembled, and the suction force became stronger and stronger. It wanted to pull the seven great emperors of the evil god race in. However, they resisted with all their might, and they couldn’t move at all.</p><p>At this moment, the sky Fire Emperor also arrived at the light door. He poured his terrifying power into the light door, making it even more attractive.</p><p>However, he was still lacking.</p><p>The seven great emperors of the evil god tribe attacked in a frenzy, and their attacks were too terrifying.</p><p>Uncle Kong and the others only had four people. They tried their best to stop him, but the situation was very dangerous.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Emperor formless was struck. His body trembled, and blood flowed from his mouth.</p><p>But he still fought to the death and did not retreat.</p><p>At the same time, the Holy Emperor was also hit and heavily injured.</p><p>“Heavenly Fire, let’s start!”</p><p>Huntian Emperor looked at Sky Fire Emperor.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor nodded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Sky Fire Emperor and huntian Emperor’s bodies exploded with a terrifying aura. Their bodies seemed to be on fire, as if they were two men of fire.</p><p>And the attraction of the looking out world gate suddenly increased several times.</p><p>The seven people from the evil god tribe felt a terrifying suction force, and their bodies slowly moved toward the world gazing gate.</p><p>The world-gazing gate led to the heaven realm. If one was sucked in, they would enter the heaven realm directly. If they didn’t find the right void passage, they wouldn’t be able to come back.</p><p>This way, he could solve the crisis of Yuan mountain.</p><p>you’re crazy! You’re all burning!</p><p>The demon spirit religion master roared and charged forward.</p><p>The other evil god tribe’s emperors burst forth with all their might, and all sorts of astonishing powers blasted out toward uncle Kong and the others.</p><p>The power of the world looking gate was useless to uncle Kong and the others.</p><p>“Enter!”</p><p>Uncle Kong and the others blocked, not allowing the other party to charge out.</p><p>Four against seven, they were at an absolute disadvantage. At this moment, it wasn’t just the formless Emperor, the Holy Emperor, the Emperor-like emperors, and even Uncle Kong. They were all injured.</p><p>But they didn’t care about their injuries and stood there like a divine wall.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor shouted. Their bodies seemed to become transparent as they tried to merge with the world-gazing gate, and the attraction force became stronger.</p><p>“No, I’m not willing…”</p><p>Finally, one of the evil god race’s emperors couldn’t hold on any longer and was sucked into the world looking gate, disappearing from sight.</p><p>The other evil god tribe’s great emperors were alarmed as they roared out and started to fight for their lives.</p><p>However, the huntian Emperor and the sky Fire Emperor’s bodies were almost about to merge into the full view gate. The full view gate’s power was even stronger, causing great disturbance to the evil god Emperor.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and he felt his nose turning sour.</p><p>Huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor were obviously risking their lives to send the other party into the heaven realm to ensure the safety of Mount Yuan.</p><p>In the heaven realm, most of the territories had been occupied by the evil god tribe. There were countless experts from the evil god tribe gathered there, and a few more great emperors would not make much of a difference.</p><p>“Get in!”</p><p>Emperor notionless, uncle Kong, and the others continued to attack, trying to force the other party through the world viewing gate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Finally, another person was drawn into the world-gazing gate.</p><p>Every time someone was attracted in, the pressure on uncle Kong and company would decrease, and the resistance would decrease.</p><p>No matter how unwilling the other party was, there was no way to reverse the situation. One by one, they were drawn into the world-gazing gate and disappeared.</p><p>A moment later, all of the evil god tribe’s great emperors were drawn into the world gazing gate.</p><p>At this moment, Sky Fire Emperor and huntian Emperor’s bodies became almost transparent.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ll leave the houyuan mountain to you!”</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor cupped his fists.</p><p>“You two, take care!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor, uncle Kong, and the others all cupped their fists. Their faces were filled with sadness and helplessness.</p><p>Lu Ming also stepped forward, cupped his fists, and bowed to the two great emperors.</p><p>At this moment, he only had respect for the two great emperors.</p><p>“Lu Ming, with your talent, it won’t be a problem for you to surpass us old guys in the future. I look forward to your growth!”</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor said with a smile.</p><p>Huntian Emperor nodded and said nothing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the realm-gazing gate flashed and suddenly disappeared. Sky Fire Emperor and huntian Emperor also disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. The two great emperors had disappeared just like that. Could they have fallen?</p><p>It was obvious that the great emperors had planned everything.</p><p>Lu Ming first used the chaos stone plate to seal the void passageway while the huntian Emperor and the sky Fire Emperor used the world-looking gate to bring the evil god tribe’s great emperor to the heaven realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
