He was a peak true Emperor. Although the living being in the building was strong, it had definitely been suppressed for countless years and didn’t have much fighting power left.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s demonic saber slashed down, and that huge arm was chopped off.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Within the building, a living being roared. The chains clanged and the building rumbled as if a giant beast was about to charge out but in the end, it didn’t.</p><p>The ashen Demon King dashed past him, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Up ahead, Lu Ming’s expression was grave. The living beings in these buildings could not stop the Azure Demon King at all. He had to speed up.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and rushed forward at top speed.</p><p>Not long after, another creature roared from another building. This time, it was a large flame that spewed out from the building.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and rushed past it.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming came across a few buildings that had living creatures, but he used the prison-suppressing stele to charge through them.</p><p>Behind him, Cang Demon King was chasing after Lu Ming at an alarming speed. If not for the creatures that obstructed him along the way, he would have caught up to Lu Ming long ago.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming was rapidly thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>Now that Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was out of his control, with his own cultivation base, facing the Azure Demon King was a dead end.</p><p>However, other than the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, he had no other treasures on him that could resist the Cang Demon King.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming crossed a long distance. There were no buildings in front of him, only some low rocks.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He could only continue to rush forward.</p><p>Now, he could only try his luck and hope that there was something up ahead that could stop the Azure Demon King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a fleeting shadow, his speed shocking as he rushed forward.</p><p>Behind him, the Azure Demon King continued to pass through buildings and soon arrived at the low rocky area.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, who was in front, suddenly stopped.</p><p>That was because there was no road ahead!</p><p>There was a Lake that blocked their way!</p><p>This was a lava lake. It was extremely vast, completely blocking the path ahead, and exuded a terrifying temperature.</p><p>This was definitely not ordinary lava. Lu Ming felt a sense of danger.</p><p>“Haha, kid, why aren’t you running anymore?”</p><p>The Azure Demon King caught up and stopped not far away. He looked at Lu Ming with a faint teasing look.</p><p>old man, you’re too narrow-minded. You’ve lost your own face, but you want to blame it on me!</p><p>As Lu Ming spoke, he was thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>Even if he was in a desperate situation, Lu Ming would not give up.</p><p>“It’s not a good thing for young people to be in the limelight!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King said coldly as he walked towards Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming should not have made a move and sat quietly. How could he embarrass himself in public?</p><p>boy, you must have had a lot of fortuitous encounters to reach this stage. Give me everything you have, including some ancient scriptures, and I may let you Live!</p><p>The Azure Demon King laughed coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. It would be strange if this old fellow would let him go. Even if he gave him everything, the other party would still kill him and not spare him.</p><p>“What can I do to make you believe me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“In the current situation, you have to believe it even if you don’t want to!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King said coldly.</p><p>“Kill those three guys and I’ll give it to you. I’ll give you all the opportunities I’ve obtained!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked behind the ashen Demon King.</p><p>Behind him, the other three experts had followed the Azure Demon King’s path to this place.</p><p>Hearing this, the three of them couldn’t help but stop, their faces turning pale.</p><p>The Azure Demon King was cruel and merciless, he might really do so.</p><p>“Brat, you don’t have the right to bargain with me now. If you don’t hand it over, I’ll cripple you right now and then slowly interrogate you to see if you’ll hand it over or not!”</p><p>A cold killing intent burst out from the Azure Demon King’s body as terrifying demonic flames spread out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved. He took a step forward and his body leaped towards the lava lake.</p><p>Now, he could only rely on the lava lake to take a gamble.</p><p>“You want to escape? die!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King bellowed as he struck out with his palm. Demonic flames filled the sky and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The demonic flame was like a bolt of lightning. It was astonishingly fast and caught up to Lu Ming in an instant, enveloping him within.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a beast-like roar.</p><p>It was too painful!</p><p>It was too painful to be enveloped by the demonic fire. Lu Ming felt as if his body was about to be burnt.</p><p>Lu Ming manically circulated his Saint energy and covered his body. At the same time, he controlled the law of chaos and the light of chaos to cover the surface of his body and resist the attack of the demonic fire.</p><p>However, this demonic fire was released by the Azure Demon King. A peak true Emperor was too terrifying. All of Lu Ming’s defenses were burned through in an instant.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming fell into the lava lake and disappeared.</p><p>As soon as he entered the lava lake, Lu Ming mustered his remaining strength and frantically rushed down the lava lake.</p><p>“You want to leave? impossible!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s expression was extremely cold. He rushed into the lava lake and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Azure Demon King waved his palms, stirring up the surrounding lava. A few terrifying demonic flames broke through the lava and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not Dodge at all and was hit by a few more demonic flames.</p><p>The terrifying temperature of the demonic flames burned through Lu Ming’s defenses, and a heart-piercing pain spread throughout his body.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s current spirit body, he could not withstand it at all. He seemed to feel that his physical body was turning into ashes bit by bit.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still did not give up. He was charging down crazily.</p><p>The temperature at the bottom of the lava lake was shockingly high. The further down he went, the higher the temperature became. There was also a terrifying pressure that pressed on Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely unable to withstand the dual burning of the Azure Demon King’s demonic flames and the magma. His body was slowly burning to ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the flesh and blood on his body were disappearing, and even his bone armor was exposed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming continued to descend at an astonishing speed because the Azure Demon King was still in pursuit.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Cang mo struck out with his palm again. However, the pressure of the lava here was already shocking. Although Cang Demon King’s palm force had broken through the lava, it had been partially offset and only a part of it landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s hands and feet had turned into ashes in the demonic fire. Only his body was still struggling to hold on as he continued to fall.</p><p>However, the Azure Demon King didn’t give up on his pursuit. The two of them kept going down. Along the way, the Azure Demon King launched a few more attacks, but because of the lava, most of the power was blocked.</p><p>At this moment, they had already dived down a distance of several thousand meters.</p><p>At this point, the temperature was already extremely terrifying. Even the Azure Demon King felt a sense of danger.</p><p>It was as if there was something below that could threaten his safety.</p><p>“Hmph, this kid is dead for sure!”</p><p>The Azure Demon King snorted..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
