A Son of Heaven who had reached the Emperor-to-be realm could indeed fight with a one-star void Emperor and even suppress him.</p><p>The stronger Son of Heaven, after reaching the Emperor-to-be level, could even defeat a one-star void Emperor, but it would be difficult to kill him.</p><p>He had never heard of someone like Lu Ming, who could kill a one-star Emperor-to-be in a few moves.</p><p>the battle of the ten lands this time will probably be extremely intense. I wonder what kind of freaks will appear?”</p><p>Chuai Kai couldn’t help but think.</p><p>“Brother he, are you hiding something from me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he looked at the man.</p><p>He felt that something was wrong. Those sea beasts seemed to have locked onto them and were chasing after them.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why do you say that?”</p><p>Nie Kai’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>these sea beasts are obviously coming for us. I don’t have anything. You’re the only one they’re after!</p><p>“Besides, I’m really curious. You’re a heaven’s favorite of the divine destiny land. Why did you come to the yuan mountain? Now, people from all over the world are gathering toward the divine land!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I knew I couldn’t hide it from you, brother Lu. To be honest, a few months ago,</p><p>I set off from the divine fated land and entered the ring sea. I stole a treasure from the ring sea. This treasure is very useful for refining puppets!</p><p>“However, at that time, I was being chased by sea beasts and all the people who followed me died. I was lucky and escaped to Yuan mountain. This time, I was preparing to return, but I didn’t expect to be targeted by sea beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly, it seems like the sea beasts attacked the ship this time because of you! he said.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>He finally understood why there were so many sea beasts attacking the ship for no reason.</p><p>This was all because he had stolen a peerless treasure from the sea.</p><p>I didn’t expect it to turn out like this either. I’ve already laid down layers of seals on that treasure, and I thought that the sea beasts wouldn’t be able to sense it. Now, it seems like the sea beasts still have a trace of it, or they wouldn’t have attacked the ship!</p><p>“And there wouldn’t be sea beasts constantly chasing after me!”</p><p>Chao Kai smiled bitterly.</p><p>it seems like the sea beasts only sensed it a little. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a bunch of shrimp soldiers chasing after you, but a true Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you have a solution?”</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>yes, you can leave that treasure to me for safekeeping. 1 can completely isolate the aura of the treasure!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and looked at the splitting.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, nie Kai nodded and took out a storage ring, handing it to Lu Ming.</p><p>It must be known that it was definitely a peerless treasure since it could attract so many powerful sea beasts. Lu Ming had not expected it to be split open and handed over to him.</p><p>brother Lu, the treasure is in the storage ring. I’ve overlapped several storage rings and placed them in my Eden treasure, but I didn’t expect that I still couldn’t completely isolate it!</p><p>Gao Kai sighed.</p><p>With his status, he naturally did not lack Grotto-heaven treasures.</p><p>“Brother he, don’t worry. I’ll return it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the storage ring that he had split open into two into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not rely on the mountain and river diagram to isolate the aura of the treasure.</p><p>Even if he used an Eden treasure to cut it open, it would not be able to isolate it. Naturally, the mountain and river diagram would be useless as well.</p><p>Lu Ming relied on the divine breath technique!</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. Lu Ming used the divine breath technique to completely conceal the aura in his body and isolate it.</p><p>Naturally, at the same time, it also isolated the aura emitted by the sea of consciousness.</p><p>After that, the two of them continued to move forward. As expected, they did not attract any more sea beasts.</p><p>The two of them continued on their journey, and after a day, the two of them flew out of the sea.</p><p>brother Lu, we won’t be able to reach the divine land if we go like this. The ocean is constantly changing, and it’s easy to get lost. There are also many dangerous places. We need to stop a cross-sea warship to reach the divine land!</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Di Kai was a proud Son of Heaven in the land of a divine destiny. He knew more about the ring sea.</p><p>After that, he took out a puppet and suspended it in the air. The two of them sat on the puppet and waited quietly.</p><p>Now, they could only try their luck and see if there were any cross-sea warships passing by.</p><p>Fortunately, during this period of time, there were many cross-sea warships coming and going, so they might be able to encounter them.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he sat on the puppet and studied the puppet technique.</p><p>The puppet technique recorded in the Jade talisman given by Chi Kai was extremely profound.</p><p>However, Lu Ming already had the foundation of puppetry. Most importantly, he had mastered the array Dao laws.</p><p>Although the laws of array Dao didn’t match the puppetry techniques like the laws of craftsmanship, inscriptions and runes were also necessary to refine puppets.</p><p>Therefore, by controlling the array Dao laws and comprehending the puppetry technique, he could achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>Just like that, they waited here for half a month.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In front of them, a huge object was sailing over. It was the sea-crossing warship, and it was heading from the yuan mountain to the divine land.</p><p>The two of them released their auras and made a commotion, attracting the attention of the people on the cross-sea warship.</p><p>As the cross-Sea Battleship approached, one of the powerhouses stared at them and said,” “What’s wrong with you? Why did it appear in the ring sea?” my Lord, our cross-sea warship was attacked by sea beasts more than half a month ago and was blown up. We escaped!</p><p>Chi Kai replied.</p><p>so, you’re the survivors of that cross-sea warship. Come on!</p><p>That expert’s expression changed, and then he let the two of them board the ship.</p><p>The last time the cross-Sea Battleship was attacked by the sea beasts, many people had survived. This news had already spread, and the cross-sea battleships passing by had naturally heard of it.</p><p>Since they had encountered survivors, they naturally didn’t mind giving them a ride.</p><p>Of course, raw gemstones had to be paid.</p><p>The two of them boarded the cross-Sea Battleship. The cross-Sea Battleship was restarted and they headed toward the divine land.</p><p>This time, there was no more danger. After seven days, they finally crossed the ring sea and arrived at the divine fated land.</p><p>what a rich origin Qi! The origin Qi in the divine land is even richer than that in Yuan mountain!</p><p>After getting off the cross-sea warship and arriving at the shore, Lu Ming took a deep breath.</p><p>brother Lu, the shenxiao sect is a force near the sea. You can go there from the nearby teleportation array!</p><p>Richard said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was his first time in the divine land and he was unfamiliar with the people and the place. He needed to find a place to settle down and get to know the place better.</p><p>Moreover, there were still more than four months before the battle of the ten lands. It was still early, so he was not in a hurry to go to destiny city. He could take a look around.</p><p>“Brother he, this is your storage ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming returned the storage ring that he had split open.</p><p>“Many thanks, brother Lu!”</p><p>Chu Kai received it and expressed his gratitude.</p><p>When he handed the storage ring to Lu Ming previously, he was already prepared that Lu Ming would not return it. If Lu Ming did not return it, he could not do anything about it.</p><p>Lu Ming returned the storage ring to him. He was rather touched and admired</p><p>Lu Ming.</p><p>He was indeed impressed that he was unmoved by the treasure in front of him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
