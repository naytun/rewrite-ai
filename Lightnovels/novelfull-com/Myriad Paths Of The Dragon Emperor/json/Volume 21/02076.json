Countless people rushed out of the rooms on the battleship and rushed to the deck. When they saw the countless sea beasts around them, their faces turned pale.</p><p>“What’s going on? There aren’t many sea beasts in the ring sea, and they rarely gather together to attack the warships. What’s going on?”</p><p>“Why are there so many sea beasts gathering all of a sudden?”</p><p>Some of the more experienced people cried out in alarm, their expressions extremely grave.</p><p>Some people from the Chambers of Commerce often traveled between the two places and had never encountered such a situation.</p><p>“Everyone, the situation is bad. Prepare to face the enemy!”</p><p>A middle-aged man with a violent aura and a true Emperor realm cultivation said.</p><p>This man was the captain of the cross-Sea battleship, an expert from a major force in the divine land.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a giant pillar stretched out of the sea. It was hundreds of thousands of feet long and like a giant stick, it smashed toward the cross-sea warship.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ‘giant stick’ struck the light shield of rhe cross-sea warship, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>At this time, everyone realized that it was not a giant stick at all, but an octopus’s tentacle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Sure enough, rhe next moment, the sea churned, and a huge monster emerged from the sea.</p><p>Ir was a huge octopus, even bigger than a mountain and a cross-sea warship.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The eight tentacles of rhe octopus waved like eight giant whips and whipped toward the cross-sea warship.</p><p>The cross-sea warship shook violently as if it was going ro be overturned at any moment.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Countless people’s faces turned pale.</p><p>This octopus was definitely a terrifying existence. It should be a true</p><p>Emperor-level creature, and its aura was too strong.</p><p>In addition, there were many powerful existences among the sea beasts in all directions. If the cross-sea warship was destroyed, they would be in danger when facing so many sea beasts and the harsh environment around the sea.</p><p>Many people s faces turned pale!</p><p>In the past, he had heard that it was very safe ro take the cross-sea warship. There were very few accidents. Why did something happen the moment they took the warship?</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The captain of the cross-Sea Battleship, the middle-aged man, shouted and rushed out of the light shield. A saber appeared in his hand and he slashed.</p><p>A blade light, tens of thousands of feet long, cut through the void and slashed at the octopus.</p><p>Pffr!</p><p>An octopus’s tentacle was cut off by the blade light, and its blood dyed the sea red.</p><p>Gali!</p><p>The octopus let out a strange roar, as if it was enraged. The remaining tentacles attacked the burly man.</p><p>The burly man continued to slash out blade lights, fighting against the octopus.</p><p>Both of them were extremely powerful beings with monstrous strength. Ir was difficult ro determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Right at this moment, a heaven-shaking roar came from the sea. The water churned and another huge creature appeared.</p><p>“A true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes narrowed.</p><p>A huge creature appeared in the sea. It was actually a true dragon.</p><p>It was a Blue Dragon. Its entire body was blue, and it was sparkling and resplendent. Its body was over 30000 meters long.</p><p>Its two huge eyes coldly looked at the cross-sea warship, and its terrifying aura made people tremble.</p><p>He was also a powerful true Emperor.</p><p>senior, why are you attacking us? can you let us go?”</p><p>A young man stepped forward and spoke to the true dragon.</p><p>Then, the young man’s body began to change. He was also a true dragon.</p><p>in the land of Mount Yuan, there were countless spiritual elegant mountain peaks, and naturally, there were some true dragons living there.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>However, the huge true Dragon in the Sea didn’t give in. It roared and attacked the cross-sea warship.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the blue true dragon stepped forward, the sea water roared and turned into water pillars, blasting toward the sea-crossing warship.</p><p>The cross-Sea Battleship shook, and the light shield kept shaking. If this continued, it would not be able to hold for long.</p><p>However, what made them feel despair was that another giant creature appeared in another direction. It was a shark, and it was extremely huge. It was no weaker than the true dragon, and it also attacked the Trans-sea warship.</p><p>“Everyone, now, let’s all run for our lives!”</p><p>The cross-Sea Battleship was a powerful force in the divine land. Naturally, there were many people on the battleship. At this moment, an elder, who was also a powerful existence, spoke.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The cross-Sea Battleship kept shaking, and finally, with a bang, the defensive shield was broken.</p><p>The true dragon let out a long roar and stepped on rhe sea. Its mountain-like dragon claws grabbed at the cross-Sea Battleship and tore a piece of the ship.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>The old man charged at the true dragon.</p><p>However, the shark crashed into the warship, almost breaking it apart.</p><p>At the same time, countless sea beasts roared and charged over from all directions.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>On the cross-Sea Battleship, countless people rushed in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue also rushed down from the sea-crossing warship at the first moment and rushed toward the depths of rhe sea.</p><p>Roar! Gah!</p><p>The sea beasts let out all sorts of strange cries. He realized that the powerful ones among the sea beasts had their eyes on the beings on the warship at once. Many of rhe beings above the rank of martial Supreme were fighting with each other.</p><p>On the other hand, the sea beasts below the martial Supreme realm attacked the people or divine beasts below the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>A chaotic battle broke our on the sea’s surface. It was extremely tragic. People kept screaming and falling into rhe sea, dying here forever.</p><p>Of course, there were also sea beasts that were killed, and their blood stained the sea.</p><p>‘Qiuyue, you enter the mountain and river diagram first!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded. She knew that her abilities were far inferior to Lu Ming’s. It would be more convenient for Lu Ming to move alone.</p><p>After storing Qiu Yue into rhe mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming flew toward the depths of rhe ring sea.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A huge silver swordfish, like a divine sword, lulled a human absolute Saint and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and killed the swordfish. Its body was torn into pieces.</p><p>However, more sea beasts pounced at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm continuously, killing seven ro eight sea beasts.</p><p>there are too many sea beasts. If this continues, it’ll be very difficult to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He would be in danger if he was targeted by the powerful void Emperor or even rhe true Emperor.</p><p>After all, during the battle in the demonic sea, Lu Ming had controlled the celestial Thearch’s body to fight against two great emperors. There was not much energy left in rhe celestial Thearch s body. He could no longer control it if it was less than ten percent.</p><p>Without a Celestial Emperor corporeal body, he could only rely on himself to charge through.</p><p>“Into the sea!”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart skipped a beat. He plunged into the sea and swam toward the depths of the sea.</p><p>As rhe saying goes, rhe most dangerous place is the safest place.</p><p>Those sea beasts were either on rhe surface of the sea or in the air, chasing after humans and divine beasts. Their power in the sea would definitely be much weaker.</p><p>As expected, afrer Lu Ming entered the sea, he realized that there were fewer sea beasts. Mosr of the sea beasts eyes were on the surface.</p><p>Lu Ming swam forward rapidly.</p><p>However, just because there were few sea beasts did not mean that there were none. There were still sea beasts that had their eyes on Lu Ming and were charging at him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
