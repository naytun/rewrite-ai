He felt a sense of danger approaching. He turned around abruptly and pointed his finger behind him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The energy of rhe chaotic finger of tribulation burst out and hit a piece of armor.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The armor shook a little, but it was fine. It did not leave any traces behind. It swayed twice in the air and pounced directly at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming repeatedly pointed the finger of tribulation of chaos at rhe armor, but it was useless. The armor only shook a few times and continued to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming saw that there was blood flowing on the armor. It stretched out toward him like tentacles.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the chaos laws and the light of chaos to resist.</p><p>However, when the tentacle touched the chaotic laws and chaotic lights, they started to rock heavily and were torn apart in one breath.</p><p>Lu Ming s figure retreated rapidly, his hair standing on end.</p><p>This armor was extremely terrifying. It could not even block the light of chaos.</p><p>“Prison suppression!”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart skipped a beat. The prison-suppressing stele s bloodline emerged behind him, emitting a brilliant light that suppressed the armor.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>When the blood-red tentacles on the armor touched the energy of the prison-suppressing stele, they made a sizzling sound, like ice being thrown into a fire, melting quickly.</p><p>The blood-red tentacles retracted, and the armor disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“That was close!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the prison-suppressing stele and heaved a long sigh.</p><p>The armor was extremely evil. It seemed to have a spirit and was indestructible. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Lu Ming is there!”</p><p>Not far away, a loud roar came from the black-robed middle-aged man and the others, who were chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that they had discovered Lu Ming’s use of the prison-suppressing stele. The light was too strong.</p><p>“You really don’t want to give up!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes flickered and he dashed in one direction.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived in front of a Hall. The door of the hall was left ajar.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura to the extreme. He approached the door and looked inside.</p><p>In the courtyard, there had been a skeleton wearing armor. Now, there was another skeleton, but the armor was gone.</p><p>“It’s indeed this armor …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged and floated above his head. Lu Ming rushed toward the skeleton.</p><p>There was nothing unusual. Lu Ming came to the side of the skeleton.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the door flashed and the armor appeared. It twisted in a very human-like way, as if it was very nervous.</p><p>don’t come any closer. Otherwise, I’ll destroy this skeleton!</p><p>Lu Ming condensed a large hand with his holy power and grabbed the skeleton.</p><p>As expected, the armor stopped and did not dare to approach.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes lit up. It seemed that his guess was right.</p><p>The armor and the skeleton were one.</p><p>Or rather, the owner of the armor was the skeleton.</p><p>Perhaps the skeleton had been very powerful when it was alive, and the powerful energy from its death had nourished the armor, allowing it to gain sentience.</p><p>However, the armor was still restricted by the skeleton. Once the skeleton was destroyed, the armor would also be affected.</p><p>“Back off!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The armor twisted a few times, but in the end, it still retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile, follow behind me. Don’t do anything rash. 1 can destroy this skeleton with a single thought!</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming left the courtyard and headed in one direction. The armor could only follow behind Lu Ming obediently.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The prison-suppressing stele expanded rapidly and emitted a bright light that could be seen from far away.</p><p>Then, he put away the prison-suppressing stele and hid the armor in a building, waiting quietly.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long before a figure flickered in front of them. It was a black-robed middle-aged man, who was leading a group of people over at extreme speed.</p><p>However, he did not see the other two martial sovereigns.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked behind him.</p><p>Two silhouettes approached at top speed from behind. They were the two martial sovereigns who had chased after him.</p><p>Obviously, the other party was afraid that Lu Ming would run away and attacked him from both sides.</p><p>“Two one-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a cold smile and stood there without moving.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the black-robed middle-aged man, along with seven or eight Emperor-to-be and two void emperors, surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>it seems like that old fellow Gang Demon King really spent a lot of money to kill me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you’re a genius, it’s a pity that you don’t know how to conduct yourself. You even dared to offend the Azure Demon King. Only death awaits you!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless.</p><p>Speaking of which, from the beginning to the end, he had never taken the initiative to provoke the Azure Demon King. It was the other party who had been targeting him.</p><p>First, he was not allowed to participate in the competition. In the end, Lu Ming defeated the ancient devil and slapped him in the face. Did he not ask for it?</p><p>Such a person could only be described as narrow-minded.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, be careful not to lose your lives here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and cast destruction. The primal Chaos tribulation finger pointed at rhe black-robed man.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man moved as well. His palm was like a blade as he slashed out. A demonic blade light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Destruction. The finger of tribulation of chaos was shattered after only a few strikes. Lu Ming retreated hastily.</p><p>But at this moment, the armor rushed out of a building and entangled an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be let out a shrill scream and his body quickly withered.</p><p>“Kill Lu Ming first!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into a Hall at the side.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged burly man and two other martial sovereigns rushed into the hall and chased after Lu Ming. Of course, that included the Emperor-to-be.</p><p>The palace was huge, but it was empty. There was not a single living being in it.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the hall and headed deep into the hall.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Behind them, another shrill scream was heard.</p><p>The armor swallowed one emperor-to-be and then entangled another.</p><p>Moreover, as the armor devoured the Emperor-to-be, it seemed to become stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the beginning, it would take several breaths to devour an Emperor-to-be, but now, it only took one breath.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man roared. If this went on, the Emperor-to-be wTould be devoured.</p><p>you two, continue chasing. I’ll go block that armor!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man roared and turned around to attack the armor.</p><p>By the time he arrived, another Emperor-to-be had been swallowed by the armor.</p><p>In just a short while, three Emperor-to-be had already been devoured by the armor.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man was furious. He attacked with all his might.</p><p>However, the armor didn’t fight with him at all. It flickered a few times and escaped.</p><p>The remaining five Emperor-to-be’s faces were pale and bloodless.</p><p>“Next, follow me closely!”</p><p>The black-robed man said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
