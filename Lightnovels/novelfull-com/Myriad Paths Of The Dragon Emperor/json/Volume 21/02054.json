I didn’t expect that you would secretly kill the devil nation’s experts. You’re simply cruel and unscrupulous. You deserve to be killed!”</p><p>“Laughable. You want to kill me? there’s no need to make it sound so high and mighty. It was the Azure Demon King who sent you to kill me, right? you’re just a Lackey!”</p><p>Lu Ming ridiculed. At the same time, he was rapidly thinking of a way to escape.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man did not say anything more. He took action immediately. The power of the world burst forth and turned into a Saber Light, slashing at Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>A two-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming determined that this person should be a two-star illusionary Emperor. He was stronger than a one-star illusionary Emperor, but not to such an outrageous extent.</p><p>However, a two-star illusionary Emperor was far from what Lu Ming could withstand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left. He turned into a ray of light and headed in the direction of the ancient city.</p><p>If he wanted to shake off his opponent, he could only rely on the ancient city.</p><p>“You want to leave? No way!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man shouted coldly. He turned into a black light and chased after Lu Ming. At the same time, he slashed out a black demonic light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed. Dozens of absolute Saint weapons and two sovereign weapons floated in the air. The dozens of weapons gathered together, and the combat weapon Qi gathered to form a huge defensive weapon.</p><p>At the same time, the Laws of Chaos and the light of chaos were added to the combat weapon. Lu Ming did not care about it and moved forward at top speed. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s demonic light slashed at the combat weapon behind Lu Ming. The combat weapon trembled and the dozens of weapons were almost scattered.</p><p>If it weren’t for the two monarch weapons, the fact that the battle weapon Qi was perfectly fused together, and the chaotic light and chaotic laws, an ordinary absolute Saint weapon would have been shattered by this attack.</p><p>The terrifying power gushed towards Lu Ming continuously. He felt his blood churning and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>But in the end, he still managed to block it. Moreover, that force had become his driving force, allowing him to fly forward at a faster speed.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s face turned cold.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was really terrifying. He was actually blocked even with his two-star illusionary divine combat strength.</p><p>However, at the thought of the reward promised by the Azure Demon King, his heart burned with passion and he chased after Lu Ming even faster.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>In front of the ancient city, there were tens of thousands of demon spirits. They were all wearing armor and holding weapons, shouting and killing.</p><p>Lu Ming was approaching the ancient city rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man in the black robe launched another attack. A beam of demonic light slashed at the combat weapon behind Lu Ming, causing it to shake.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>With his current battle strength, he could still contend with an ordinary one-star void Emperor. However, the difference between him and a two-star void Emperor was too great.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and endured it. He rushed toward the dark mass of Mo Ling.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Some of the demon spirits discovered Lu Ming. Their killing intent was like a tide, sweeping towards Lu Ming. At the same time, various weapons were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s equivalent to the great saint realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he determined the strength of the demon spirit that was attacking him.</p><p>Therefore, he did not stop at all. He used the chaotic light to protect his body and rushed over.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The mo Ling that attacked Lu Ming exploded.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had dashed a few hundred meters.</p><p>However, more demon spirits immediately charged at Lu Ming. Their combat strength was stronger than before, reaching the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and continued to rush forward.</p><p>Behind him, the black-robed middle-aged man stopped.</p><p>He did not dare to be like Lu Ming and rush over rashly. It was a good time to observe first.</p><p>Behind them, there were more than ten figures rushing over. They were all old men in the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>It was obvious that most of them had arrived later.</p><p>“Just the few of you?”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said coldly as he swept his gaze across the crowd.</p><p>the two martial sovereigns will be here soon!</p><p>A white-haired old man said.</p><p>yes, we’ve been entrusted by the Azure Demon King to kill Lu Ming. We can’t make any mistakes. One of us will stay here and wait for the other martial Supremes. The rest of you will follow me and prepare to charge into this ancient city!</p><p>The black-robed man ordered.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had been charging forward and he had already covered more than half the distance.</p><p>Although there were many demon spirits, they were too scattered. Moreover, there were not many experts in the first section. The strongest was only a perfected absolute Saint. They could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>However, the closer they got to the ancient city, the stronger Mo Ling’s strength became.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few rusty iron swords came slashing at Lu Ming. The blades whistled as if they were going to tear Lu Ming apart.</p><p>This was the attack power of an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He threw a punch and a Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele appeared, crashing forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few demon spirits were sent flying by the prison-suppressing stele and turned into ashes in the air.</p><p>“The prison suppressing heavenly art really does have a restraining effect on this demon spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. He kept swinging his fists and the Emperor-to-be demon spirits were sent flying.</p><p>Even when facing an Emperor-to-be demon spirit, Lu Ming’s speed did not slow down. He quickly approached the ancient city.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man finally couldn’t help but roar,” “Charge with me!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man took the lead and rushed out. More than ten Emperor-to-be followed him like a long spear, stabbing toward the demon spirit Army. Only one emperor-to-be was left to meet the others.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man was, after all, a two-star illusionary Emperor. He led more than ten Emperor-to-be experts and instantly pierced through the Army of demon spirits like a long spear, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Ordinary demon spirits could not stop them at all.</p><p>When the black-robed middle-aged man was halfway through, Lu Ming was already about to break through the mo Ling’s defense.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming was in trouble.</p><p>Two terrifying demon spirits launched an attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>These two demon spirits were both wearing rusty armor. One held a sword, and the other held a spear. Their strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>These were two demon spirits that were equivalent to one-star void Emperor.</p><p>The iron sword and long spear flew towards Lu Ming, shattering his prison-suppressing stele’s illusionary shadow and blocking his path.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank slightly. Sure enough, there was a Martial Emperor in the demon spirit Army.</p><p>Fortunately, they were not too terrifying. The two demon spirits were only equivalent to one-star void Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming has been blocked. Let’s kill our way over!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s eyes lit up. He charged toward Lu Ming at an even faster speed.</p><p>With the two demon spirits blocking Lu Ming and him, Lu Ming would definitely die!</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mind moved. The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline floated out and expanded rapidly. It emitted thousands of rays of light and suppressed the two demon spirits.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele was more effective against the demon spirits. The two demon spirits were sent flying by the force of the stele.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he broke through the demon spirit Army’s encirclement, rushing towards the ancient city.</p><p>The strange thing was that when Lu Ming was within a certain range of the ancient city, the demon spirits stopped in their tracks and no longer chased after him.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and sprinted towards the city gate of the ancient city..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
