Lu Xiangxiang was so young, yet she had such a cultivation level. Furthermore, she was able to pass through the passageway in eight minutes. She was definitely very talented. The more he looked at her, the more he liked her.</p><p>“Little girl, who is your master? I’ll go talk to him!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“My master is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang’s crisp voice rang out, causing everyone’s heart to tremble.</p><p>Yuan Xin, the son of chaos, had his eyes flash with Two Bright Lights like sword lights.</p><p>The elder devil’s eyes flickered and a layer of demonic light spread out from his body.</p><p>There was also Mu yang. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent as he looked at Lu Xiangxiang with hostility.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk muttered as if he was reminiscing. He sized Lu Xiangxiang up again.</p><p>“Lu Ming? which Lu Ming?”</p><p>The old man asked again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the son of chaos of Mount Yuan!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang added.</p><p>so it’s him, Lu Ming, the son of chaos. I’m so young, but 1 have a disciple like you. Like master, like disciple!</p><p>The old man sighed and continued,” your master’s talent is indeed unrivaled. If he doesn’t die, it’s normal for him to surpass me in the future. However, he has already fallen…</p><p>“No, I believe that my master is not dead!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shook her head, her delicate little face filled with determination.</p><p>“Little girl, why don’t you reconsider?” The old man was still unwilling to give up.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior, but this junior will not change his master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang shook her head firmly.</p><p>“This girl!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>“Little fellow, what about you? do you have a master?”</p><p>At this moment, another elder stared at Ouyang Moli.</p><p>“Yes, my master is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ouyang mo said.</p><p>The scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>The eyes of Yuan Xin, Mu yang, and the others lit up.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming? Lu Ming again? which Lu Ming?”</p><p>The great emperor realm old men were all stunned.</p><p>“She’s my Senior Sister!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli pointed at Lu Xiangxiang and said.</p><p>At the scene, everyone else was stunned.</p><p>He was really Lu Ming’s disciple.</p><p>Three sons of God in one family, this made everyone speechless.</p><p>The Son of God was extremely rare.</p><p>Even in the golden age, there were only a few of them.</p><p>It was only during the battle of the ten lands where all the talents of the yuan continent gathered that they could see the Son of Heaven from time to time.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was the Son of God. His two disciples were also the sons of God. In such a situation, even heavenly Emperor powerhouses would be jealous.</p><p>“My master is definitely not dead!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli said in unison.</p><p>he’s not dead. What a joke! He’s just deceiving himself!</p><p>Mu yang said with a cold smile.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang glared at Mu yang.</p><p>I’m just telling the truth. You’re so arrogant just because you have a little cultivation. How dare you behave atrociously in the divine land? you won’t even know how you died!</p><p>Mu yang sneered.</p><p>“Hmph, if I, the Supreme martial artist, were here, what would you be? He’ll definitely be abused by my master!”</p><p>Ouyang Moli coldly replied.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>In an instant, Mu yang was enraged. His face turned red with anger.</p><p>He thought that Ouyang Moli was mocking him on purpose. He had indeed been brutally abused and trampled under Lu Ming’s feet previously. He had lost all his face.</p><p>However, in reality, Ouyang Moli did not know Muyang at all. He had no idea that he had already been ruthlessly abused by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Did 1 get it right? Have you really been tortured by my master?”</p><p>Ouyang Moli seemed to have noticed something and continued to mock.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Muyang was furious. His body was filled with cold killing intent as he walked towards Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli.</p><p>“What are you doing? Is this a place for battle?”</p><p>An old man’s cold eyes swept over to Mu yang, causing Mu yang to shiver and break out in cold sweat. He was like a deflated balloon.</p><p>In the end, the old men sighed. They knew that it was a pity that Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli would not acknowledge a master.</p><p>After that, more and more people passed through the passage.</p><p>Half an hour later, about 1000 people passed. The rest who did not pass were all eliminated.</p><p>Out of more than three thousand people, only one thousand were left, alright, there’s still the third round of screening. Follow me!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor came again and announced the result.</p><p>Everyone followed, including the great emperors. The dense crowd flew towards another mountain peak.</p><p>The peak of this mountain was extremely wide, as if it had been cut off by a sword. It looked very smooth.</p><p>In the middle of the mountain, there was a huge fighting stage. It was covered with purple-gold light, which was the power of the formation.</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor landed on the stage and said,” this round of screening is the last round. Only 80 places will be left!</p><p>Eighty spots!</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Out of more than a thousand people, only eighty remained. The probability of elimination was too high.</p><p>Moreover, this was only the selection process. What about the final battle?</p><p>the rules are the same for all four battlefields. Eighty people will be selected from each battlefield, and a total of three hundred and twenty people will be engaged in the real battle, the ultimate showdown!</p><p>however, let me tell you something. After this round of selection, all of you will be given an opportunity, a great opportunity. Many of you might even be able to use this opportunity to step into the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor announced.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>After this round of selection, one would actually be able to obtain an opportunity and even step into the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>One must know that the step from Emperor-to-be to Martial Emperor was extremely difficult to cross.</p><p>Since ancient times, countless geniuses had been stuck at this step. Some were stuck for a few years, some for a few decades, and some for thousands or tens of thousands of years.</p><p>In fact, many people could not break through in their entire lives.</p><p>This was a Ridge, a big cut.</p><p>Once one stepped into it, it meant that one’s lifespan would be endless. As long as one survived the heavenly Tribulation that occurred once every three hundred thousand years, one would be able to live forever. How carefree would that be?</p><p>Countless people’s lifelong goal in cultivation was to become a martial Supreme.</p><p>Now that there was an opportunity that could allow someone to break through to the martial Supreme realm, everyone’s hearts were burning with excitement.</p><p>Before the battle of the ten lands, there were great emperors who had revealed that this battle would be accompanied by great opportunities. It seemed like it was true.</p><p>I must enter the top 80.1 must obtain this opportunity!</p><p>Many people clenched their fists and swore to themselves that they would make it into the top 80.</p><p>Those who had already been eliminated sighed.</p><p>Especially those sons of God, their eyes were even more dazzling.</p><p>the rules for this round are very simple. Everyone will step onto the fighting ring together and engage in a free-for-all battle. The 80 people who remain in the fighting ring will be the 80 people who advance to the next round!</p><p>of course, there’s a condition. You can join forces, but the number of people joining forces can not exceed three. Exceeding three people will be considered a violation of the rules!</p><p>The middle-aged Emperor announced..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
