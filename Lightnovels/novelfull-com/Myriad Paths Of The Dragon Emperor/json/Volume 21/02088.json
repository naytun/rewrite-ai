It’s just the two of us. I’ll kill this bastard one day!</p><p>Desolate Li said, looking at Mu yang unhappily.</p><p>“Switch!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the MU family powerhouse.</p><p>“Hand over young master Muyang first, and we’ll let him go!”</p><p>One of the MU clan experts said slyly.</p><p>“Nonsense, hand him over, or I’ll cripple him right now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A long spear appeared in his hand and he pointed it at Mu Yang’s dantian.</p><p>The MU clan’s people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Mu Yang’s identity was too important. They didn’t dare to take the risk.</p><p>In their eyes, Long Chen, Huang Li, and the others only had King physiques. How could their worth be compared to Mu yang?</p><p>“Alright, we’ll let them go!”</p><p>One of the MU family experts shouted. He released Long Chen and desolate force and the two of them quickly flew to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Now, can you release young master Muyang?”</p><p>An expert of the MU clan said.</p><p>“Let him go now? Do you think I’m stupid? this is Aeon city, the MU family’s territory. If I let him go now, your Mu family’s experts will kill me with one slap.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Brat, don’t go too far …”</p><p>An expert of the MU clan roared. The other experts of the MU clan also had ugly expressions.</p><p>They had indeed hidden an expert in the dark. As long as Lu Ming released Mu yang, the expert of the MU family would make a move and kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>Only death awaited those who dared to threaten the MU family.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not fooled at all, which made them furious.</p><p>The others were also secretly amazed at Lu Ming’s courage and his meticulous mind.</p><p>“What do you mean I’m insatiable? I’m doing this to save my life. Your young master Muyang’s life is so precious. To be honest, it’s not worth it to die because of us!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and clasped Mu Yang’s neck. Mu Yang’s eyes were about to spew fire.</p><p>He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>In the end, the MU clan gave in, and an expert spoke.</p><p>“Let us leave the city. The people of your Mu family can’t follow us. I have a secret technique that can sense the presence of experts. Once we leave the city and sense the people of your Mu family following us, I’ll kill Mu yang immediately. It’s a life and death struggle!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As for what secret technique he had that could sense the aura of experts, it was pure nonsense to deceive the MU family.</p><p>He had no choice. He was facing a behemoth like the MU family, and he couldn’t use the celestial Emperor corporeal body now, so he could only use some tricks.</p><p>“How can we trust you? what if you harm young master Muyang after you leave the city?”</p><p>One of the MU clan experts said, not willing to back down.</p><p>“You can only take a gamble. You have no other choice!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice caused the MU family experts to narrow their eyes and reveal killing intent.</p><p>“Moreover, your Mu family is so powerful, and I don’t have any grudges with you. I don’t have to offend the MU family, so why would I kill Mu yang? I’m not crazy!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>The expert from the MU family muttered to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. If Lu Ming really killed Mu yang, he would have to face the MU family’s crazy revenge. It would not benefit Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Alright, we promise you. Kid, you’d better not play any tricks!”</p><p>An expert of the MU clan said.</p><p>“Of course not. Long Chen, desolate power, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming carried Mu yang and flew out, with Long Chen and desolate power following closely behind.</p><p>“It’s best if your mu clan doesn’t let anyone else follow us!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the others. Some of them wanted to join in the fun, but Lu Ming would not allow that. What if the people from the MU family were mixed in?</p><p>“Everyone, please wait!”</p><p>The people from the MU family were helpless. They knew that Lu Ming was meticulous and had no loopholes. He could only block the others.</p><p>The MU family’s power was unparalleled, so the others naturally wouldn’t go against them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two, along with Mu yang, headed out of Aeon city at top speed. Of course, Qiu Yue followed them.</p><p>As for di Kai, Lu Ming had sent him a voice transmission telling him to stay in Aeon city. As di Kai did not have much of a relationship with Lu Ming and they had just met, the MU family would not make things difficult for him.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest left Aeon city. Lu Ming did not put down Muyang immediately.</p><p>He was afraid that there would be trouble if the MU family had an expert in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming used the array Dao law to completely seal Muyang. Soon, they arrived at a huge mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group rushed into a cave and avoided all the gazes.</p><p>this kid is too meticulous at such a young age!</p><p>There were indeed two figures in the sky. They were experts from the MU family. They were both at the peak of the true Emperor realm and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>They concealed their aura and hid in the sky. As long as Lu Ming released Muyang, they would attack and kill Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was very careful and hid in the cave. They could not see him and did not dare to scan him with their spiritual senses. If Lu Ming noticed them, he might really kill Muyang.</p><p>They could only wait.</p><p>Qiu Yue, Long Chen, desolate, use your divine breath technique and hide in my mountain and river diagram!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue and the other two in the cave.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram alone wasn’t enough. A true Emperor realm expert was too powerful. They could sense the aura within the treasure.</p><p>Only by using the divine breath technique and the mountain and river diagram could he isolate the other party’s aura.</p><p>Qiu Yue and the other two had all cultivated the divine breath technique.</p><p>The three of them nodded. After using the divine breath technique, they entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming threw Muyang into the cave and looked at him coldly.’Tell yuanxin that I’ll behead him sooner or later!” He said.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s body sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed the law of chaos into the law of the earth and sank into the ground for hundreds of miles. At the same time, he cast the divine breath spell to restrain his aura to the extreme. Then, he went deep into the divine land.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill Mu yang. He knew that Mu yang would definitely seek revenge later on. However, if he killed Mu yang, he would have to face the crazy revenge of the entire Mu family. There might even be a great emperor. That would be even more dangerous for them.</p><p>In the sky, the two true emperors had been waiting for half a day. They had already lost their patience.</p><p>“It’s been so long, let’s go down and take a look!”</p><p>One of them said, and the other nodded. The two of them rushed down and arrived at the cave. They saw that Muyang was covered in dense runes.</p><p>One of the true emperors waved his hand and broke the seal on Mu yang.</p><p>As soon as he regained his freedom, Mu yang started to roar madly.</p><p>This time, he had lost a lot of face. He would become the laughingstock of everyone. His hatred for Lu Ming could not be washed away no matter what.</p><p>“Send someone and find that brat for me!”</p><p>Mu yang roared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
