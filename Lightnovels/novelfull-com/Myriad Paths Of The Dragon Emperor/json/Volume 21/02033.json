In terms of power, they were far inferior. The law of six Hells was a bit like a simplified version of the law of reincarnation.</p><p>The six worlds enveloped Ji Tian, making him look like a demonic god.</p><p>“Look at the burning laws of the six Hells!”</p><p>Longyan let our a long roar, and the flames soared into the sky like a flaming God of War. A flaming spear appeared in his hand and he charged at Ji Tian.</p><p>He thrust his long spear forward, and a terrifying spear light pierced towards Ji Tian, trying to pierce through his laws of six Hells.</p><p>“Six hell divine fist!”</p><p>Ji Tian stepped forward and threw out his fists. It was as if he was driving the six worlds. The six worlds turned into fist radiance and blasted toward the Dragon Flame.</p><p>boom!</p><p>The spear and the fist radiance collided with each other, producing a violent boom.</p><p>The destructive Heavenly Fire law of the Dragon Flame could burn everything. It had the power of destruction and was extremely terrifying. It was no weaker than the law of the six Hells. With a boom, rhe two of them retreated at the same time.</p><p>But then, the two of them charged at each other again and started to fight.</p><p>Their combat strength was almost on par. A few years ago, the two of them had fought for hundreds of moves before the victor was decided.</p><p>It was the same this time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves, but it was still a draw.</p><p>“There’s hope!”</p><p>The eyes of the powerhouses from the Luo family lit up.</p><p>If this went on, he might end up like the eldest Princess you ning and the little princess Luo Xuan, both of whom would suffer.</p><p>in the past, they were afraid of such a situation because they were no match for the you family under the king physique.</p><p>But now, they were looking forward to such a situation because of Lu Ming.</p><p>The you family’s powerhouses were the exact opposite. This was extremely disadvantageous to the you family, and their faces were all gloomy.</p><p>Ji Tian and Long Yan fought fiercely, and dozens of moves passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion, and the two of them retreated.</p><p>Ji Tian, I’ve said it before. You won’t be able to defeat me in a few years!</p><p>Long Yan opened his mouth. His voice was like a great Bell, and the terrifying flames were about to rush into the clouds.</p><p>His eyes were bright, as if he had vented his anger.</p><p>“Hehe, Long Yan, you’re really naive!”</p><p>At this moment, Ji Tian smiled faintly and his voice was filled with sarcasm.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Long Yan’s eyes narrowed. For some reason, he had a bad feeling when he saw Ji Tian’s smile.</p><p>Could it be that Ji Tian had not used his full strength?</p><p>“Then I’ll let you see my true strength!”</p><p>Ji Tian sneered and took a step forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ring of light emanated from Ji Tian’s body and surrounded him like a god descending to the mortal world.</p><p>light of law! You’ve cultivated the light of law!</p><p>Long Yan’s pupils contracted sharply as he roared in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>At that moment, rhe powerhouses of the Luo family and the you family could not help but be shocked. They stood up from their seats and emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>However, the feelings of the two families were completely different.</p><p>hahaha, nomological light. It’s the light of the king path’s nomological light. There’s no suspense in this battle!</p><p>The you family experts laughed in excitement.</p><p>As for the Luo family, they were in disbelief. In the end, they sat back in their seats heavily, as if all their strength had disappeared in an instant.</p><p>The light of law!</p><p>Ji Tian had actually refined the light of law. There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>Long Yan was definitely not Ji Tian’s match. They both had King physiques, but there was a huge difference between the light of law and the light of law without it.</p><p>If Long Yan was defeated, Lu Ming would naturally be defeated.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Luo Xuan also spoke helplessly.</p><p>At first, she seemed to have seen the light of victory. As Lu Ming also had the king physique, it was very likely that they would win this battle.</p><p>However, she had never expected Ji Tian to have cultivated the light of law.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to cultivate the light of laws with a King physique, but once it was cultivated, it would far surpass other King physiques.</p><p>Ji Tian has indeed refined the light of law!</p><p>At this moment, you ning’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>She was secretly glad that she did not offend the Ji family because of Lu Ming.</p><p>The Ji family not only had the defender-general of the state, bur Ji Tian s talent was even more amazing.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s ability was not bad, there was a huge difference between him and Ji Tian.</p><p>At this moment, she was extremely relaxed. The trace of regret she had for kicking Lu Ming out had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming could not influence the overall situation.</p><p>“The you family will definitely win! ”</p><p>The surrounding spectators also sighed.</p><p>it seemed that the you family would continue to rule the youluo demonic kingdom.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the fighting ring, Ji Tian performed the light of law. His aura became stronger and pressed toward the Dragon Flame.</p><p>“Long Yan, do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Ji Tian asked indifferently, as if he was above everyone.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Long Yan gritted his teeth and charged at Ji Tian with the flaming spear in his hand.</p><p>you overestimate yourself. Then I’ll let you see the power of the light of law. 1’11 let you see the difference between not cultivating the light of law and cultivating the light of law!</p><p>Ji Tian threw a punch, and the power of the light of law was added to the fist force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The punch collided with Long Yan’s spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Long Yan’s spear trembled and buzzed. The destructive Heavenly Fire law on it trembled. The next moment, Long Yan’s destructive Heavenly Fire law was pierced through. The terrifying power made Long Yan retreat more than a dozen steps before he could regain his balance.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Long Yan’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His eyes revealed a trace of shock.</p><p>He was no match for him at all, and was injured by his opponent in one move.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Ji Tian threw two consecutive punches. Although the Dragon Flame tried its best to resist, it was no match for him and was completely suppressed.</p><p>After two punches, Long Yan spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Long Yan shook his head with a lonely expression. He moved and rushed out of the fighting ring.</p><p>He knew that it would be useless to continue fighting. He was no match for Ji Tian and would only be humiliating himself.</p><p>“I lost again!”</p><p>The head of the Luo family and the other experts sighed helplessly.</p><p>They had been defeated again, and the you family would continue to rule rhe youluo demonic kingdom for the next ten thousand years.</p><p>They had been defeated three times in a row, and they were somewhat unwilling.</p><p>If this continued, the Luo family would disappear, and it would be even more difficult to compere with the you family.</p><p>The you family members were naturally ecstatic.</p><p>“Brother Luo, do you still want to continue?”</p><p>The you family master was all smiles as he looked at the Luo family master.</p><p>Of course, he was happy. With the you family’s victory, he would continue to be the king of the youluo devil Kingdom and dominate the region.</p><p>in his opinion, rhe Luo family only had Lu Ming left, so there was no need to compere anymore. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, could he possibly fight Ji Tian?</p><p>“Country ruler, according to rhe rules, this competition will continue until the end, until all the people on one side are defeated!”</p><p>Ji Tian cupped his fists and said to rhe you family master.</p><p>He had yet to kill Lu Ming and take revenge for Huang Song.. How could he let the competition end early?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
