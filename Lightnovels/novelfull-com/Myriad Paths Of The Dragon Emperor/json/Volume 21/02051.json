There were hundreds of Emperor-to-be who were at the end of their lifespans. The strength of this Super Devil nation in the land of myriad Devils was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>However, on second thought, Lu Ming understood.</p><p>The sage realm could live for 100000 to 200000 years, but it was too difficult for an Emperor-to-be to break through and reach the Martial Emperor realm. After so many years of accumulation, the number of Emperor-to-be was absolutely shocking.</p><p>It wasn’t just the eternal demon nation. It was the same for other powers in other places.</p><p>These people didn’t have long lifespans. If they didn’t find an opportunity to break through, they would die of old age sooner or later.</p><p>As for the martial sovereigns, they were not at the end of their lifespans. Instead, they were about to face the next Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>A martial sovereign’s Heavenly Tribulation was stronger than the previous one. If he could not keep on breaking through, he would die under the heavenly Tribulation sooner or later.</p><p>Since ancient times, countless martial sovereigns had been born. However, only a few of them could truly live on. Most of them had died under the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The Martial Emperor himself could actually sense the probability of him surviving the Great Tribulation.</p><p>For example, the people in front of him were not confident that they could survive the Great Tribulation. Therefore, they also wanted to enter the demonic sea to try their luck and see if they could make a breakthrough.</p><p>It was the same for the Azure Demon King. He was still a few thousand years away from his next great calamity.</p><p>Thousands of years might seem long, but to these ancient martial sovereigns, it was just the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, the space flickered and the ancient Emperor appeared. Everyone bowed to him.</p><p>this time, the main mission of entering the demonic sea is to take back the eternal demonic coffin. At the same time, I can try my luck!</p><p>The ancient Emperor ordered. With a wave of his hand, a black jade token appeared in the air.</p><p>carry these Jade tokens with you, and you’ll be able to roughly sense each other’s location. If we get separated in the demonic sea, we can gather according to the directions shown on them!</p><p>The ancient Emperor introduced them before waving his hand. A Jade token flew out to everyone, giving them one each.</p><p>Lu Ming also received a piece and kept it.</p><p>let’s go. You guys enter my small world first. I’ll Take You There!</p><p>The ancient Emperor said. Then, he waved his hand and Lu Ming felt a force enveloping him. In the next moment, he appeared in an unfamiliar place.</p><p>“This is the small world of the great emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the sky and looked around, exclaiming.</p><p>All he saw were vast mountains, with no end in sight.</p><p>There were still living creatures in the mountains, but Lu Ming realized that these creatures were different from those in the outside world.</p><p>There was a high chance that this was the little world of the ancient Emperor, a living being that was born on its own.</p><p>Great emperors controlled great DAOs, but there were only 3000 great DAOs. If they controlled different great DAOs, the small world would naturally be different, and the creatures would be different. It was extremely wonderful.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around curiously.</p><p>Not far away, the Azure Demon King’s eyes would sweep over Lu Ming from time to time, flashing with killing intent.</p><p>After about half a day, a force acted on their bodies and they left.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that they were standing on the peak of a mountain.</p><p>“We are already at the edge of the demonic sea!”</p><p>The voice of the ancient Emperor rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked forward.</p><p>In front of him was a pitch-black cloud, like an ocean of clouds.</p><p>There was no end in sight.</p><p>This was the demonic sea!</p><p>The devil sea was not a real ocean, but was called the sea of devil Qi.</p><p>The demonic sea was filled with endless demonic Qi. It was vast and boundless, like a vast ocean, so it was called the demonic sea.</p><p>once we enter the demonic sea, everything will become unpredictable. You all have to follow me closely!</p><p>The ancient Emperor said as he took the lead and charged towards the demonic sea.</p><p>The crowd followed closely behind the ancient Emperor.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the black mist stuck to his body as soon as they entered the demonic sea. It was highly corrosive. Lu Ming quickly circulated his Saint energy to resist.</p><p>Fortunately, the corrosion wasn’t very strong. An Emperor-to-be should be able to block it.</p><p>They flew forward for a while and then flew straight down.</p><p>The demonic sea’s terrain seemed to be very low.</p><p>They continued to descend, and they had descended tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>However, the deeper he went, the fainter the demonic Qi seemed to be. At the end, he could resist it with just a little Saint power.</p><p>At this moment, they finally saw the ground.</p><p>It was a vast gray land.</p><p>The entire land was gray, deathly silent, and devoid of life.</p><p>After they landed, they were highly focused.</p><p>This was the demonic sea, one of the three most terrifying forbidden areas in the land of ten thousand demons. If one was unlucky, even emperors would be injured if they entered.</p><p>They naturally didn’t dare to be careless and were on full alert.</p><p>The ancient Emperor spread out his consciousness as though he was sensing something. Then, he flew into the depths of the demonic sea.</p><p>The ancient Emperor’s speed was extremely slow, and everyone was still able to keep up.</p><p>This region was deathly silent, without any signs of life. They had flown for a full day, and they didn’t know how far they had flown, but they hadn’t encountered a single living creature or any danger.</p><p>look, an ancient city!</p><p>At this moment, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone looked to the side, and indeed, there was an ancient city in the mountains.</p><p>However, this was only a ruined city. It had completely collapsed, as if it had fallen from the sky.</p><p>They went to take a look, but they didn’t find anything.</p><p>Some people once speculated that the demonic sea was an ancient battlefield.</p><p>However, some people said that the things in the devil sea fell from the sky, which was why the devil sea was formed.</p><p>From the looks of this ancient city, it really did look like it had fallen from the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, the ancient Emperor turned around and looked behind him.</p><p>Everyone was shocked and quickly looked behind them, but there was nothing there.</p><p>Some of them were scared. Was there really something behind them? Otherwise, why would the great emperor be so wary?</p><p>“Great emperor, what did you find?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>The ancient Emperor frowned and shook his head. “Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>After saying that, he flew forward.</p><p>The crowd followed, but many of them had grave expressions.</p><p>Even the great emperor seemed to have some apprehensions, which made them feel scared.</p><p>They couldn’t be so unlucky as to encounter something that even great emperors were afraid of, right? if that was the case, the situation would be bad.</p><p>Very quickly, they had flown a very long distance.</p><p>Right at this moment, the ancient Emperor came to a sudden stop. Looking into the void, he hollered out,” “Get out here!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ancient Emperor then struck out with his palm.</p><p>The power of a great emperor was earth-shattering and extremely terrifying. With a single palm, the entire void was shattered.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The void exploded. At this moment, everyone saw a figure wrapped in a black robe. No one could see his face clearly.</p><p>However, this figure’s strength was extremely shocking. His body flickered non-stop, and he was so fast that not a single one of the ancient Emperor’s palm strikes could hit him.</p><p>“A great emperor realm expert!”</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed, becoming extremely unsightly.</p><p>That figure was definitely at the Emperor level. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to Dodge the palm of the ancient Emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
