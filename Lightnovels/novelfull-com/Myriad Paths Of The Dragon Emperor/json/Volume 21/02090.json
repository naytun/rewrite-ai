However, his anger and killing intent had not subsided at all.</p><p>In the past half a month, the news that Lu Ming had brutally abused Muyang had spread throughout Aeon city and the entire divine land at the speed of a hurricane.</p><p>Muyang was known as a seed expert, but he had been beaten so badly by someone. That person was a son of chaos and was only in the absolute Saint perfection. It was hard not to be noticed.</p><p>Now, many people were secretly discussing that Lu Ming had stepped on Muyang’s face in public and he was being held hostage. He had become a laughing stock.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Mu Yang’s face was twisted, filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Have you found out where that b * stard is?”</p><p>Mu yang coldly asked the person who had come to report.</p><p>“Young master, I’ve found out that Lu Ming and the others have entered destiny city!”</p><p>A burly man reported.</p><p>Hmph, you want to hide in the city of Destiny? don’t even think about it. Kill him! Send someone into the city of Destiny and kill that bastard!</p><p>Mu yang roared.</p><p>“Young master, this is not appropriate!”</p><p>A white-haired elder spoke. He was a powerful true Emperor from the MU family.</p><p>“Why is it inappropriate?”</p><p>Mu yang said coldly.</p><p>“Now, several powerful forces in destiny city have already given orders that no one is allowed to make a move in destiny city. Otherwise, we’ll be their enemies. If we send people to make a move in destiny city, I’m afraid well offend these powerful forces!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Although the MU family was the Overlord force of Aeon city and had great strength, there was still a gap between them and the other overlords in the city of Destiny.</p><p>Even the MU family didn’t dare to offend the overlords of destiny city.</p><p>Mu Yang’s face darkened.</p><p>After a while, Muyang said coldly, we don’t need to do it ourselves. Go find the people of the death god nation. These lunatics will do anything as long as you pay them!</p><p>In the main hall, the expressions of the others all changed, and a trace of fear flashed through their faces.</p><p>They seemed to be very afraid of this force called the death god nation.</p><p>The death god nation was indeed terrifying in the divine land.</p><p>This was because this was a terrifying assassin organization with all kinds of terrifying assassins. As long as they were paid, they could kill any strong person.</p><p>Furthermore, the death god nation loved to hunt and kill geniuses and experts. Their most glorious record was that a great emperor was killed by the death god nation, shocking the entire divine land.</p><p>Some people even suspected that this death god nation was created by a foreign race.</p><p>There were also powerful forces that wanted to destroy this organization, but this organization was too mysterious. No one knew where their headquarters were. At most, they could only destroy some branches, but they could always rise again.</p><p>Now, Mu yang was going to hire the assassins of the death god nation to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Other people didn’t dare to make a move in destiny city, but the death god nation did.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll only die if you offend me!”</p><p>Mu yang said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in destiny city for a month.</p><p>cultivating like this is still a little slow!</p><p>One day, Lu Ming ended his cultivation and sighed.</p><p>Now, the chaos laws had reached a bottleneck. They were only one step away from perfection. It seemed like they could cross it at any time, but this time could be a few months or a year or two. It was hard to say.</p><p>There were some people who were stuck for thousands of years.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s main focus was on the death rule and the devour rule.</p><p>With the improvement of these two laws, his combat strength would also become stronger.</p><p>However, even with the eye of death, the improvement of the death rule was still too slow. Lu Ming was not satisfied.</p><p>I’ve heard that there’s an ancient battlefield in destiny city, which contains powerful death Qi and evil Qi. Many people who cultivate the evil law practice there, and it’s the most suitable place for cultivating the death law!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He planned to head to the ancient battlefield to cultivate.</p><p>Now, there were still about two months before the battle of the ten lands. Everyone was trying to improve their cultivation.</p><p>That was because he heard that there would be great opportunities in the battle of the ten lands. Only the strong could get them.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was very powerful now, there would always be someone stronger. Who knew what other terrifying geniuses there were?</p><p>Now, had anyone broken through to the Emperor realm?</p><p>If there were powerful geniuses who had already entered the Martial Emperor realm, their abilities would definitely be terrifying. Lu Ming had a sense of urgency to improve his abilities as soon as possible.</p><p>He bade Qiu Yue, Long Chen, and Huang Li goodbye before leaving the inn and heading towards the ancient battlefield.</p><p>That ancient battlefield was located in the northern part of heaven’s will city. It was a battlefield left behind from ancient times. There was a deathly silence there, filled with the Qi of death and evil.</p><p>Lu Ming was as fast as lightning. He was very fast but it still took him half a day to reach the ancient battlefield.</p><p>This was a vast mountain range, and it was deathly silent. At a glance, it was completely bare, without any living beings.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into it.</p><p>“The aura of death is indeed dense!”</p><p>As soon as he entered the mountains, Lu Ming felt that the death energy here was very dense and very suitable for cultivating the death law.</p><p>Moreover, the deeper he went, the denser the death Qi became.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to venture deeper.</p><p>He also discovered other people on this battlefield.</p><p>They were all people who cultivated evil cultivation techniques or evil laws.</p><p>Lu Ming ventured deeper and finally came to a low peak. He sat cross-legged and quietly comprehended the death law.</p><p>As expected, the speed of comprehending the death law here was several times faster than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming had great gains every day.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s mastery of the death rule had reached about 88%.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know that there was a group of people on a tall mountain peak outside the ancient battlefield.</p><p>This group of people were all covered in black robes, and their faces could not be seen clearly.</p><p>that kid is cultivating in that ancient battlefield!</p><p>One of them reported to a man wearing a Grim Reaper’s mask.</p><p>good. I heard that the kid is the son of chaos. If we kill him this time, we’ll definitely shake the divine fate land. Hehehe!</p><p>The expert wearing the Grim Reaper’s mask sneered and ordered,” wait a minute, let’s end this quickly. Let’s quickly kill that brat and leave this place. After a while, I’m afraid that the experts from those forces will arrive!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Some of the black-robed men bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>“Go, I’ll stand guard here. If the people from those forces come, I’ll inform you to evacuate in time!”</p><p>The man wearing the Grim Reaper’s mask said.</p><p>After that, the black-robed men’s figures flashed and they left the place one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly felt his hair stand on end. He had a sense of terror.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Without thinking, he burst out with energy and his body was like a spring, bouncing from the spot..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
