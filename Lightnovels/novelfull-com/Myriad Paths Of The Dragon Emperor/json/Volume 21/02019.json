It was close to the yuan mountain and had a vast territory.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the teleportation array and first came to the teleportation area outside the ancient yang sacred land. Then, he flew to the land of infinite demons.</p><p>The ancient sun sacred land was the sacred land closest to the land of ten thousand demons out of the nine sacred lands of Mount Yuan.</p><p>After flying for more than ten days, the demonic Qi gradually became denser. Then, Lu Ming saw a large river in front of him that stretched across the land.</p><p>This was the ancient Devil River, which separated the land of myriad Devils from the yuan mountain. It was unknown how long it was, but it was 8000 miles wide. The strange thing was that the water of the ancient Devil River was black.</p><p>Only by crossing the myriad Devil River could one reach the land of myriad Devils.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He rose into the air and flew to the other side of the primeval Demon River.</p><p>The ancient Devil River was rich in devil Qi and bred some strange demonic beasts, some of which were very powerful.</p><p>These demonic beasts were filled with dense demonic Qi and were called demonic beasts in the land of ten thousand demons!</p><p>In the process of crossing the river, Lu Ming ran into some trouble. He was attacked by some demonic beasts, but he managed to get past them all. The most dangerous time was when he even encountered a huge shark at the Martial Emperor realm. Fortunately, Lu Ming used the divine breath technique to hide his aura and luckily avoided it.</p><p>It took Lu Ming three days to cross the 8000-mile distance and reach the territory of the land of myriad demons.</p><p>“Such dense demonic Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that the demonic Qi in the land of infinite demons was extremely rich.</p><p>Demonic Qi was actually a type of energy of heaven and earth. Warriors could absorb and refine it, but if they were not cultivating demonic techniques, it would be very difficult to absorb and refine it. It was much slower than absorbing the natural energy.</p><p>However, if he cultivated demonic techniques, he would be like a fish in water when he absorbed demonic Qi. His cultivation would be faster.</p><p>Therefore, the land of infinite demons was a heaven for demonic cultivators. Most of the Warriors here were demonic cultivators. No matter what laws they comprehended, their true essence and Saint power all contained demonic power.</p><p>the land of infinite demons is said to have thousands of devil nations. Among them, there are two strongest devil nations, and the ancient devil nation is one of them.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and started to plan his next itinerary.</p><p>There were countless devil nations in the land of ten thousand Devils, and they were divided into low-tier devil nations, middle-tier devil nations, high-tier devil nations, and Super Devil nations.</p><p>The ancient devil nation was a Super Devil nation. It was extremely powerful, even stronger than Emperor-level powers like the he clan and the Heng clan. It had been around for countless years.</p><p>It wasn’t going to be that easy to use the ancient devil nation’s national treasure. First, he had to get to the eternal devil nation and get to know the upper echelons of the nation. Only then would he be able to find a way to use the eternal demonic coffin.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade card and sank his spiritual sense into it. A map automatically appeared in his mind.</p><p>This was the map of the land of myriad demons.</p><p>This was the map given to Lu Ming by Emperor notionless. As a great emperor, it was not strange for him to have a map of the land of myriad demons.</p><p>On the map, the territories of tens of thousands of devil nations appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming watched for a while, then rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After flying for a short while, Lu Ming heard a roar coming from ahead. There were figures fighting.</p><p>There were more than a dozen figures fighting each other. Demonic Qi surged and saber lights flashed.</p><p>The people fighting were divided into two sides. However, it was obvious that one side was stronger. With a Flash of the Blade, someone was killed.</p><p>In a short while, all the people on one side were killed.</p><p>The rest of them were all dressed in black robes and carried demonic blades on their backs. Their eyes were fierce and filled with ruthlessness.</p><p>Demonic cultivators, due to the influence of demonic Qi, had very strange personalities.</p><p>Some people were ruthless, some were brutal, but they all had one thing in common. Those who cultivated in the demonic path would not be soft-hearted, and their attacks were decisive and ruthless.</p><p>“Collect these guys” storage rings, quick!”</p><p>One of the leaders shouted as he collected the interspatial rings of those who were killed.</p><p>“Commander, there’s a kid over there!”</p><p>Someone saw Lu Ming and cast a cold gaze at him.</p><p>hehe, I’ll just have another source of income. Kill him!</p><p>The leader of the group sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In an instant, seven to eight burly Men in Black surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, hand over your storage ring and 1’11 leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>A black-robed man said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly. He did not expect to encounter a robbery the moment he arrived at the land of myriad demons.</p><p>Before he came here, he had heard that the land of myriad demons was very chaotic and that most demonic cultivators were warlike. It was common for them to kill each other if they didn’t agree with each other. Today, he saw that it was indeed so.</p><p>However, the strongest of these people was only a bright Saint. The others were all half-Saints. It would be too overconfident to Rob him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted, and the aura of an absolute Saint exploded.</p><p>The terrifying aura caused the expressions of the seven or eight black-robed men to change drastically.</p><p>“Absolute Saint, it’s an absolute Saint!”</p><p>“Senior, please spare our lives. We have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. We will immediately get lost!”</p><p>The seven or eight burly men revealed an expression of extreme fear. They were almost scared to death.</p><p>This was only the border of the land of infinite demons. Normally, there wouldn’t be any experts here. Why were they so unlucky to meet a young-looking man who was actually an absolute Saint?</p><p>They broke into a run and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered to attack these people with their cultivation.</p><p>This was just a small interlude in Lu Ming’s journey to the land of myriad demons.</p><p>He continued to fly, but to Lu Ming’s dismay, he would encounter robbers every once in a while. Some of them were reckless and wanted to attack Lu Ming, but he killed them easily.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming’s absolute Saint stage cultivation was undoubtedly revealed as he flew. Many robbers fled as soon as they sensed Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>After flying for more than ten days, Lu Ming passed by a few low-rank devil nations and found that almost all of them were at war.</p><p>What made Lu Ming even more depressed was that these low-rank devil nations did not have teleportation arrays. They could only rely on flying.</p><p>After flying for a few more days, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he stopped when he was passing by a vast demon mountain.</p><p>He found a Valley with an astonishingly dense demonic Qi.</p><p>such dense demonic Qi is perfect for the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb some energy!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Now, the energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was almost empty, and he needed a large amount of energy to replenish it.</p><p>The dangers of this trip to the eternal demon nation were unknown. The stronger he was, the better. If the celestial Emperor’s body could recover to ten percent, then his chances would be much higher.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and headed toward the valley.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming approached the valley, the roars of beasts could be heard. A few pitch-black giant wolves pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“He has the cultivation of the great saint realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. These giant wolves had the strength of a great saint.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a few giant wolves shrieked in pain. They were sent flying and fell to the ground, unable to move.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, the valley was in an uproar as howls and roars rang out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
