However, her clenched fists showed how nervous she was.</p><p>At this moment, Ji Peng had already woken up, but he was also shocked.</p><p>“King physique, there’s nothing amazing about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that you can defeat me just because you have mastered the king path law. Without the law of light, everything is illusory. Kill!”</p><p>Ji Tian roared and charged at Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>The laws of the six Hells, the light of the laws, and the arts of divine powers were activated to the extreme by Ji Tian.</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and pointed again.</p><p>Runes filled the air, and another true dragon condensed and pounced toward Ji Tian.</p><p>This true dragon contained three of the nine scrolls of the Dao of formations.</p><p>Lu Ming had only used the illusionary spirit scroll and the sealed scroll for the previous finger attack.</p><p>Lu Ming had used the annihilation scroll, the illusionary spirit scroll, and the sealed scroll. The three scrolls were combined into one, and the power of this move was almost on par with the chaos finger tribulation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the true dragon collided with Ji Tian, a terrifying force tore apart Ji Tian’s fist radiance. Countless runes surged toward Ji Tian madly.</p><p>Ji Tian’s body trembled violently, and his body was thrown back. He was in the air and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>He tried his best to resist the seal of the runes, but Lu Ming was already approaching him at high speed.</p><p>Then, he pointed his finger again.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a true dragon that had formed, but a giant elephant.</p><p>The giant elephant’s body was like a small mountain, and its legs were like heavenly pillars. It stomped toward Ji Tian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An elephant’s leg stepped on Ji Tian’s face. Ji Tian was instantly stunned. His body was like a huge rock, smashing heavily on the fighting ring, causing the ring to rumble continuously.</p><p>Ji Tian lay on the fighting ring, twitching all over, and blood kept coming out of his mouth.</p><p>Ji Tian lost and was beaten up like a dead dog.</p><p>At the scene, everyone’s eyes were wide open, and they couldn’t react for a moment.</p><p>Ji Tian used to be known as the number one expert in the youluo devil Kingdom. Now that he had refined the light of law, his strength had become even more powerful.</p><p>However, he had lost to Lu Ming despite his strength. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was even lower.</p><p>It was truly unbelievable that he could defeat Ji Tian even though his cultivation level was even lower and he had yet to refine the light of laws.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and came to Ji Tian’s side.</p><p>Although Ji Tian was severely injured, he still glared at Lu Ming as if he could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“What are you looking at? I’ve said it before, there’s nothing amazing about the king’s body, and the light of law is also nothing amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered with a hint of disdain. He then kicked Ji Tian in the face, sending him flying off the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill Ji Tian. After all, they were in the youluo demonic kingdom. Ji Tian’s father and many experts of the you family were present. If Lu Ming killed Ji Tian, the other party would not let him off.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s physical body was running low on energy. Furthermore, his goal was to head to the eternal devil nation. There was no need for him to cause any more trouble.</p><p>“Good, good! Hahaha!”</p><p>The master of the Luo family and many masters of the Luo family stood up and laughed.</p><p>The Luo family had won!</p><p>In the next ten thousand years, the Luo family would be in charge of the youluo devil Kingdom.</p><p>Previously, when Ji Tian had displayed the light of law, they had thought that the Luo family would lose for sure. They had been in despair and planned to wait another 10000 years before making a comeback.</p><p>He had never expected Lu Ming to suddenly explode. He first revealed his powerful strength, then he revealed the kingly way law and defeated Ji Tian in one fell swoop, winning the battle.</p><p>How could they not be happy and laugh at such an unexpected event?</p><p>Luo Xuan, Wu Xi, and the others were all smiling.</p><p>On the other hand, the you family members were livid.</p><p>It was supposed to be a sure-win situation, but in the end, it was lost. It was completely lost at the hands of one person.</p><p>“That kid…”</p><p>Some of the you family’s experts and Ji Tian’s father looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>It was Lu Ming who had defeated them.</p><p>what’s the background of this kid? I’ve never heard of him before!</p><p>Someone unwillingly said.</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The veins on Princess you ning’s Jade-white hands were exposed. She had crushed the handle of her seat.</p><p>She was furious. Lu Ming was originally her guest elder, but he was personally expelled from the Grand princess’s residence.</p><p>sister you ning, I really have to thank you!</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xuan looked at you ning, and his clear voice resounded throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded, not knowing what Luo Xuan meant by this!</p><p>“Luo Xuan, shut up!”</p><p>You ning called out.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you afraid that I’ll lose face if I say it? But I have to say it!”</p><p>The corners of Luo Xuan’s lips curled up slightly. I heard that Lu Ming used to be your guest elder sister you ning. However, he was personally expelled from the Grand princess’s residence. That’s why he came to me!</p><p>What?</p><p>At the scene, all the people who had no idea what was going on were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming was originally the eldest princess’s guest elder, but he was expelled from the princess’s Manor by the eldest Princess. It was only then that Lu Ming sought refuge with the little princess.</p><p>You ning, this was equivalent to giving up the victory.</p><p>If Lu Ming was in the Grand princess’s residence, there would be no doubt that the you family would win this competition.</p><p>You ning’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>Many people from the you family also looked upset.</p><p>There was actually such a thing.</p><p>moreover, 1 heard that Lu Ming offended the Ji family. In order to stabilize the Ji family, you expelled Lu Ming from the Grand princess’s residence. Perhaps in your eyes, the Ji family, or Ji Tian’s Royal body, is more important than Lu Ming. Am 1 right, sister you ning? ”</p><p>Luo Xuan continued to speak, revealing his two tiger teeth, which were filled with slyness.</p><p>You ning’s expression made her very happy!</p><p>So that was how it was!</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming had offended the Ji family. In order to stabilize the Ji family, the eldest Princess had expelled Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, the eldest Princess had needed Ji Tian’s help to win the competition at that time.</p><p>At that time, in the eldest princess’s eyes, Ji Tian’s value was probably far above Lu Ming’s.</p><p>But the truth?</p><p>It was you ning who had personally given the victory to the Luo family. On the other hand, Ji Tian, whom she valued highly, was beaten up like a dead dog by Lu Ming. How ironic was this?</p><p>The you family’s experts, Ji Tian’s father, and Ji Tian’s uncle all had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>“Sister you ning, 1 wonder what you’re thinking now? Do you feel any regret?”</p><p>Luo Xuan’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>You ning shouted and stood up abruptly. She cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and soared into the sky.</p><p>This caused Luo Xuan to giggle.</p><p>She and you ning had been fighting each other since they were young. Seeing you ning’s expression at this moment, she was extremely happy..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
