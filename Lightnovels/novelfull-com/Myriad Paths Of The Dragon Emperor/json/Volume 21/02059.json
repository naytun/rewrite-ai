Only by rushing in would they have a chance of survival.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King bellowed as he chased after Lu Ming, but the armor had caught up to him again.</p><p>The armor was covered in rust, but it was now emitting a thick blood-red light. Tentacles stretched out and wrapped around the Azure Demon King.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Azure Demon King punched out, and the terrifying force of his fist sent the armor flying far away.</p><p>However, the material of the armor was indeed extraordinary and indestructible. It wasn’t shattered by the Azure Demon King.</p><p>After the armor was knocked away, it flew back towards the ashen Demon King.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming heading deeper into the ancient city, the Azure Demon King’s face was filled with anger.</p><p>At the same time, the other four people had also arrived.</p><p>“You guys go after Lu Ming!”</p><p>The ashen Demon King said coldly.</p><p>The other four nodded and chased into the depths of the ancient city.</p><p>The Azure Demon King’s cold eyes stared at the armor, and a layer of black flames spread out from his body.</p><p>This was a type of demonic fire. It was extremely terrifying and had an astonishingly high temperature.</p><p>He pressed down with one hand, and demonic fire surged out, enveloping the armor.</p><p>After all, Cang Demon King was a peak true Emperor expert. Although the material of his armor was sturdy and immortal, the energy it contained wasn’t high. How could he be a match for Cang Demon King?</p><p>After being enveloped by the demonic flames, the armor let out a sizzling sound. The bright red blood was quickly refined by the demonic flames.</p><p>Not long after, the armor fell to the ground with a clang, as if it had become a pile of scrap iron.</p><p>In the armor, not only was the blood refined, but everything else was also refined, including the only trace of the imprint. It disappeared without a trace, completely turning into a pile of scrap iron.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was running, was startled. The skeleton in his hand turned into ashes with a bang.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the armor would not be able to stop the Azure Demon King. He was at the peak of the true Emperor realm and was only one step away from becoming a great emperor. His combat strength was too strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Behind him, four figures were chasing after Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>They were the four Martial Emperor powerhouses. One of them was covered in world divine light. He was clearly a true Emperor.</p><p>This true Emperor was the fastest. He chased after Lu Ming as fast as lightning.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from a huge building. A huge claw reached out from the building and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to rush inside. At the same time, he controlled the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and made it float above his head.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele glowed brightly. As soon as the huge claw got close to the prison-suppressing stele, it quickly retracted as if it was burned by fire.</p><p>Lu Ming successfully rushed past the building and continued to venture deeper.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the true Emperor caught up.</p><p>The true Emperor had naturally seen the huge claw just now. At this moment, the power of the world circulated through his entire body, and he was on full alert.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as the true Emperor got close, the claw stretched out and turned into the size of a house.</p><p>“What the hell is this?”</p><p>die! the true Emperor shouted coldly. The power of his world burst forth and turned into a battle axe that slashed down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The battleaxe struck the giant palm, but the palm only trembled a little and was completely fine. It only left a shallow mark on the scales.</p><p>On the other hand, the true Emperor’s body swayed and he took a few steps back.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>There seemed to be a terrifying demon in the building. It roared continuously and clawed at the true Emperor again.</p><p>He extended his arm. It was an arm covered in black scales and wrapped in black chains. It made clanking sounds as it grabbed at the true Emperor.</p><p>It was as if a world was floating out of the true Emperor’s body. In an instant, several colors of light fused together and unleashed a terrifying attack.</p><p>This was the combined use of several laws, and its power was very terrifying.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, who was only at the initial stage of the fusion of two types of laws, it was many times stronger.</p><p>At the Martial Emperor realm, one could cultivate many types of laws. They could even merge with each other and have extremely shocking power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The true Emperor’s attack clashed with The Giant Claw.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>The sound of metal chains clashing could be heard. The Giant Claw was blocked, but the true Emperor was also blocked. He couldn’t rush over.</p><p>“This creature is locked inside and can’t come out. I’ll stop it. You guys rush over and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The true Emperor opened his mouth and launched another attack. He fought against the huge hand and entangled it.</p><p>The other three people’s faces were grave. They went around the area and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to venture deeper. He passed by more than ten huge buildings and there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming continued to run, a loud boom came from a building in front of him. A large hand grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Not only was this huge hand covered in thick scales, but it also carried a terrifying cold current as it swept towards Lu Ming. Even though he was very far away, Lu Ming felt as if he was going to be frozen.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and continued to bombard the prison-suppressing stele with his bloodline.</p><p>Fortunately, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele could still restrain the other party. The big hand reached back and Lu Ming rushed past it.</p><p>Behind him, the black-robed middle-aged man and the other two had very serious expressions.</p><p>They were not true emperors. They did not dare to charge forward. They went around the building and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they weren’t so lucky. Not long after they went around, a claw reached out from another building and grabbed them.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>One of them had a huge change in expression as he frantically retreated.</p><p>The other two’s expressions also changed, and they also retreated.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man had the weakest cultivation. He was only a two-star void Emperor, and he was immediately caught.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>He let out a shrill scream and tried to break free, but it was no use.</p><p>The big hand clenched, and the black-robed middle-aged man’s bone armor burst with a crackling sound, making him spit out a large mouthful of blood. He no longer had the strength to struggle.</p><p>His eyes were filled with unwillingness and fear.</p><p>He had come in to kill Lu Ming for the reward. The generous reward could even help him survive the next great calamity.</p><p>But now, he would die Here.</p><p>After the big hand grabbed the black-robed middle-aged man, it stretched back. Then, the building was filled with shrill screams and the sound of chewing.</p><p>The other two void thearchs felt a chill run down their spines. Even with their cultivation bases, they were breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p>It was obvious that the black-robed middle-aged man had been eaten by the creature in the building.</p><p>The two of them didn’t dare to move forward and stopped there.</p><p>“Get lost, you bunch of trash!”</p><p>At this moment, the Azure Demon King rushed over and punched out at the true Emperor’s claw. Terrifying demonic fire burned and the claw was thrown off. The scales on the claw flew and fell off.</p><p>The battle power of a peak true Emperor was not to be underestimated. It was much stronger than a normal true Emperor.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Then, the ashen Demon king’s hand slashed down like a blade. Endless demonic fire turned into a demonic blade and cut the claw off..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
