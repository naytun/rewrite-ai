He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and faced the other party.”What evil intentions? I’m only speaking the truth. If Duanmu Yunyang can’t even withstand such a small blow, then what’s the point of cultivating martial arts?”</p><p>Audacious!</p><p>These were the words that emerged in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Lu Ming was too bold. He actually dared to talk back to The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster. He was the headmaster of the hall.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster’s hair stood on end. As he roared, the clouds in the sky changed color. A 100-meter-long battle saber materialized, and its terrifying aura blotted out the sky and covered the earth, enveloping the entire area. Everyone felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Chiefs of the Azure Dragon Hall and the Onyx tortoise Hall burst with two powerful forces. The vast power spread out and covered the disciples of the two halls, blocking the powerful pressure.</p><p>“Duanmu pojun, don’t you have any sense of shame? do you want to attack a junior?”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall chief’s eyes turned cold. A hundred-meter long giant sword appeared in the sky, and an aura that was no weaker than The White Tiger Hall chief’s burst forth.</p><p>A saber and a sword shook as they faced each other. In the sky, rumbling sounds could be heard.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards all looked at the sky in shock.</p><p>Was this the strength of the four great academies ‘Deans? With a single thought, the weather changed. This kind of power had already exceeded the scope of mortals and was too terrifying.</p><p>The Xuanyuan sect leader frowned and waved his hand. A gentle force surged out. However, this force seemed gentle, but it contained incredible power. The swords formed by The White Tiger and Vermillion Bird Hall Deans were instantly destroyed, turning into energy and dissipating in the sky.</p><p>“You two are the deans of the first courtyard. How can you make a big fuss in front of the disciples? Injuries are inevitable on the fighting stage. Now, quickly get someone to carry Duanmu Yunyang down for treatment!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the sect leader of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Also, Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sect leader looked at Lu Ming and said, Dean Duanmu is the Dean of the first institution, after all. You have to respect your seniors when you speak to them in the future. Don’t go against your seniors just because you’re young, understand? ”</p><p>“I know, sect leader!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and quit while he was ahead.</p><p>The headmaster of The White Tiger Hall furrowed his brows. The sect leader was obviously trying to protect Lu Ming by directly pushing the blame of the rebuttal to Lu Ming’s young age. He was at a loss for words.</p><p>Today, Duanmu Yunyang had already lost enough face. If he wanted to pursue the matter, he would inevitably end up with a reputation of being a bully. That would be even more embarrassing.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A hint of killing intent flashed across The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster’s eyes. With a wave of his sleeve, he said, ” “Take Yunyang back for treatment.”</p><p>The disciples of The White Tiger Hall immediately carried Duanmu Yunyang away.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Duanmu Yunyang’s state of mind had already been broken. If he could not walk out of it, his martial path in this life would end here. It would be very difficult for him to continue.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the winner of this battle!”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>With the announcement of the judge, the disciples of the four halls turned their attention back to the competition.</p><p>there’s still one last round. Zhang Muyun and Lu Ming are going to face each other in this round.</p><p>“Which one of them will win?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say now. After all, the two of them have comprehended control force.”</p><p>I didn’t expect this. After Duanmu Yunyang and Zhang Muyun’s battle, I thought that there was no more suspense. I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. It’s beyond my imagination.</p><p>a battle of the peak. This is a battle of the peak. The clash of power. This year’s bronze-level competition is too exciting.</p><p>It was extremely rare for two bronze disciples to comprehend the control force.</p><p>If one appeared, another would appear every few years.</p><p>However, there might not be two at the same time even after decades.</p><p>This was a rare situation, and everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>Before this, no one thought that Lu Ming was Zhang Muyun’s match. However, after Lu Ming burst out with his aura, he was completely capable of fighting Zhang Muyun.</p><p>“The ninth round begins!”</p><p>After half an hour of rest, the judge announced the start of the ninth round.</p><p>It was unknown if the ruling was intentional or if it was a coincidence, but the battle between Zhang Muyun and Lu Ming was placed at the end.</p><p>The first four matches passed quickly.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang did not participate in the battle.</p><p>Finally, it was the last match.</p><p>the fifth match, Lu Ming versus Zhang Muyun!</p><p>With the judge’s announcement, the bottom line ignited the atmosphere of the audience.</p><p>Countless people began to shout.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can do it!</p><p>“Lu Ming, senior brother Lu Ming is invincible!”</p><p>Lu Ming is so handsome. I want to bear your children!</p><p>“Nest, will Lu Ming take a fancy to you? You’re shameless, get lost! Lu Ming is definitely interested in me!”</p><p>“You’re the shameless one. Why don’t you look in the mirror? can you compare to me?”</p><p>……</p><p>The disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall cheered for Lu Ming crazily.</p><p>There were even many young female disciples who were shouting with infatuation.</p><p>There were even some female disciples who were jealous and fought with each other.</p><p>Lu Ming was young, but his cultivation level was extremely high. There was no need to mention his talent. Moreover, he was handsome and had a great attraction to girls. It was normal.</p><p>“Go, senior brother Zhang Muyun!”</p><p>senior brother Zhang Muyun will definitely win!</p><p>……</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall’s people were also shouting. Zhang Muyun’s popularity was also extremely exuberant.</p><p>It was just that he and Zhuo yirong were already a public couple, which broke the hearts of many girls.</p><p>The two of them entered the fighting ring amidst the cheers.</p><p>After half an hour, Lu Ming had been shaken by the aura of The White Tiger Hall’s Dean. He had only suffered some minor injuries and was no longer in serious danger.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, I didn’t expect the final battle to be with you!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun smiled. His smile was gentle and comfortable.</p><p>This wasn’t an act, it was an innate ability.</p><p>In fact, Zhang Muyun was very popular in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Not only was he talented, but he was also gentle and sincere. He would not act high and mighty just because he was talented.</p><p>Therefore, Zhang Muyun’s friends were all over the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming had a good impression of Zhang Muyun. He cupped his fists and said,”Senior brother Zhang, it’s my honor to be able to fight you.”</p><p>hahaha, that’s exactly what I wanted to say. However, although Junior Brother Lu’s talent is far above mine, it won’t be that easy to defeat me today.</p><p>Zhang Muyun smiled.</p><p>“I will do my best.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s do our best.”</p><p>The two of them looked at each other, and a powerful aura burst out from their bodies at the same time.</p><p>One was extremely sharp and indestructible.</p><p>A wave of violent heat burned everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Even before he moved, the two’s momentum had already begun to clash and collide.</p><p>With a loud boom, the fighting ring was suddenly replaced by a sharp and hot aura, which spread out in all directions.</p><p>The disciples on Lu Ming’s side suddenly felt as if they were enveloped by a scorching and violent aura. It was as if they had been placed in a furnace and they felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>On Zhang Muyun’s side, everyone felt a sharp pain on their skin, as if they were being cut by sharp sword energy.</p><p>If not for the silver-robed elders ‘timely intervention, many of the weaker cultivators would have been severely injured on the spot.</p><p>“Level 4 Sword Art, scorching summer!”</p><p>“Fire gun art, mountain collapse!”</p><p>The two of them launched their attacks at the same time, rushing towards each other.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
