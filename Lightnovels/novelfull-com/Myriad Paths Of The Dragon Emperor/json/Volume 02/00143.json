They almost defeated all the geniuses on the bronze rank.</p><p>He was invincible on the bronze list, and even Zhang Muyun was defeated in the end.</p><p>Everyone thought that the bronze ranking list would lose its reputation today.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming had arrived. With his jaw-dropping strength, he crushed the geniuses of Qilin Hall and even crippled Jian wuchen, turning the situation around.</p><p>Today, not only would his honor on the bronze list not be lost, but it would be elevated to a higher level because of Lu Ming.</p><p>The disciples of the four halls would think that the mysterious Qilin Hall was just so-so, so what if he had a special bloodline? He could still win against ordinary creatures with bloodlines.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was one of them. He had suppressed the Qilin Hall and was known as the head of the four great geniuses.</p><p>Now, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>In this way, the disciples of the four halls would be more confident and their faith would naturally be firmer.</p><p>brother mu Yun, this is my gift. Are you satisfied? ”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and smiled.</p><p>hahaha, Junior Brother Lu’s gift is unprecedented. Please take a seat!</p><p>Zhang Muyun laughed and invited Lu Ming to sit with him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a seat.</p><p>At this moment, there were already people coming to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>Not long after, the battlefield was roughly tidied up, and the food and wine were served.</p><p>The banquet started and the atmosphere was lively.</p><p>senior brother Zhang, I’ll toast you!</p><p>Not long after, someone began to propose a toast.</p><p>After toasting Zhang Muyun, he started to toasting Lu Ming.</p><p>He carried the wine jar in the air and came to Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, you’ve really won the hearts of many today. I, Ling Kong, have never been convinced by anyone before. Now, I’m convinced by you. Give me three big bowls.”</p><p>After he finished speaking, Ling Kong lifted the wine jar and began to gulp down the wine.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, picked up the big bowl, and drank three bowls in a row.</p><p>alright, Junior Brother Lu Ming, you’re so generous. I’ll give you three bowls of wine too!</p><p>Duan gang stood up, also carrying a wine jar.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reject anyone and drank heartily.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not put on any airs, everyone had a better impression of him and came forward to toast him. The atmosphere was very warm.</p><p>Of course, there were also exceptions. For example, the disciples of The White Tiger Hall sat awkwardly to the side, their eyes twinkling.</p><p>There were even a few people with gloomy expressions.</p><p>They were the only ones who were unhappy that Lu Ming had defeated Jian wuchen and the rest.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the more disadvantageous it would be for the Duanmu family.</p><p>Everyone exchanged toasts, and soon, three rounds of wine had passed.</p><p>During the great competition of the four courtyards, they were opponents, but that was only on the fighting stage.</p><p>After getting off the fighting ring, they realized that they were all disciples of the mystical sword sect. There was no enmity between them, and they were all young, so their relationship quickly became closer.</p><p>For example, although Cheng Feiyan was a woman, she was extremely heroic. Taking advantage of the fact that she was a Vermillion Bird Hall disciple like Lu Ming, she forced him to drink a jar of wine. In the end, she was drunk, her eyes blurred, and her face flushed red. She was extremely beautiful.</p><p>This caused Ling Kong, Duan gang, Dong CE, and the others to howl like wolves as they surrounded Cheng Fei.</p><p>A few silver-robed elders shouted from the side. They looked at these youths with anticipation in their eyes.</p><p>This was the pugilistic world, this was the spirit of a youth, full of hot blood and passion. They competed with each other, but there was no lack of friendship.</p><p>They were the future pillars of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>They couldn’t wait to see this group of people grow up.</p><p>After three rounds of drinking, it was already late at night, and the banquet ended.</p><p>Everyone formed into groups and headed back.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cultivate that night. He had a good night’s sleep after he returned to the dormitory.</p><p>It was already noon when he woke up the next day. Lu Ming felt refreshed.</p><p>As he stretched his back, his entire body emitted a crackling sound.</p><p>He opened the door and walked out.</p><p>He saw pang Shi returning from outside the courtyard with an excited look on his face.</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, pang Shi said excitedly, ” senior brother Lu Ming, you’re amazing. Yesterday, at senior brother Zhang Muyun’s banquet, you defeated a genius from Qilin Hall with three moves. The news has spread throughout the sect.</p><p>Having said that, pang Shi looked at Lu Ming in admiration.</p><p>“The speed at which the news is spreading is really fast.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, Did you know? I’ve become a celebrity now because I’m in the same dormitory as you. As long as I go out, I’ll be surrounded by a group of female disciples.”</p><p>Pang Shi continued.</p><p>“A bunch of female disciples surrounding you? What are you doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Pang Shi grinned. of course I’m here to find out about you. I’m here to find out about your hobbies, what kind of girl you like, and if you have someone you like. And after the news about you spread yesterday, the trend has become even more terrifying.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He then smiled bitterly.</p><p>He didn’t expect such an outcome.</p><p>“AI! It seems that being too famous is not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in satisfaction.</p><p>those girls were too enthusiastic. I couldn’t hold them back and told them everything I knew. Senior brother Lu Ming, you won’t blame me, right? ”</p><p>Pang Shi looked at Lu Ming naively.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work, big rock!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted pang Shi’s shoulder and casually asked, ” “Right, what did you say?”</p><p>“I told you that you like mature women and have already found a partner. It’s elder Mu Lan!”</p><p>Pang Shi said.</p><p>“What … What?”</p><p>Lu Ming staggered and almost fell.</p><p>He looked at pang Shi in shock and said, ” “You … You really said that? Heavens, who told you that?”</p><p>the love-struck fool told me. He said that you’re always trying to take advantage of elder Mu Lan. He said that he wanted to cut off all ties with you and that you’ve forgotten about your friends when you’re with a woman. From my observations, he’s quite reasonable.</p><p>Pang Shi said, scratching his head.</p><p>“Reasonable? Reasonable, my ass!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s forehead was full of black lines. He gritted his teeth and said, ” “Love-struck fool, I’m not done with you.”</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, why are you angry? what I said was quite effective. Many girls left with a sad face, saying that they won’t bother you anymore.”</p><p>Pang Shi continued.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood.</p><p>He had been careless in making friends. How was he going to face Mu Lan if this news reached her?</p><p>Mu Lan wouldn’t misunderstand, right?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could only smile bitterly and cry without tears.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s expression, pang Shi asked with concern, ” “Senior brother Lu Ming, what’s wrong? Are you uncomfortable? Could he have been injured in yesterday’s battle?”</p><p>“No, I just want some peace and quiet!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked very tired.</p><p>“Oh, okay. I won’t disturb you then.”</p><p>Pang Shi said, then returned to his room.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to cry but had no tears. He wondered if he should look for Mu Lan to explain it to her.</p><p>“Forget it, I don’t care anymore. But come to think of it, Senior Sister Mu Lan’s beauty is on the level of a calamity. It’s normal for me to have some thoughts about her, right? hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled. He quickly adjusted himself and strolled outside.</p><p>Lu Ming did not plan to cultivate for the next few days. He wanted to relax.</p><p>It had been more than a year since he had obtained the Supreme shrine and his bloodline had begun to be reborn. Lu Ming had been cultivating arduously every second of the day. He was too tensed up. Going too far was as bad as falling short. It was time for him to relax for a few days.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
