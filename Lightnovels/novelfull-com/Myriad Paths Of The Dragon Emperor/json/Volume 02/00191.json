No matter what happened, she would always have a glimmer of hope in her heart.</p><p>As long as there was hope, it was enough.</p><p>“What news?” Li Ping asked curiously when she saw how serious Lu Ming was.</p><p>“Father, he might not be dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming said seriously.</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Li Ping’s body suddenly trembled and her pupils widened.</p><p>Then, Li Ping’s body trembled more and more violently. Her eyes shone with a strong sense of hope as she said in a trembling voice, ” “Ming Xiao, Ming ‘er, what did you say?”</p><p>“Mother, I said that father might not be dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated.</p><p>“He didn’t die? He didn’t die! Ming ‘er, is this true?”</p><p>Slowly, Li Ping’s expression became one of extreme excitement, and her tears could no longer be held back.</p><p>He then asked,”Ming ‘er, where did you get this news? is it true?” If your father isn’t dead, then where has he been all these years?”</p><p>“Mother, it is like this.”</p><p>Lu Ming then told Li Ping about his encounter with Zhou Linshan in detail.</p><p>“So it’s him. Back then, he sent me a spirit sword and a pendant. I once asked about Yun Tian’s whereabouts, but he told me that Yun Tian was already dead. So he lied back then. Does that mean that Yun Tian is really still alive?”</p><p>Li Ping said excitedly, her eyes full of hope.</p><p>yes, mother. Father might have fallen into the hands of the ten direction Sword School, so I plan to go to the imperial capital to investigate his whereabouts.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, I’ve heard that the ten direction Sword School is the strongest sect in the blazing sun Empire. You have to be careful.”</p><p>Li Ping warned, very worried.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. Ming ‘er won’t go head to head with the ten direction Sword School now. He’ll just investigate. Nothing will happen!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Only then did Li Ping feel more at ease.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. As long as father is still alive, Ming ‘er will definitely be able to save him and let our family reunite.”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, mother believes you!” Li Ping said with a smile.</p><p>“Mother, I’ll be leaving then.” Lu Ming nodded heavily.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Li Ping and headed outside.</p><p>Walking out of the Lu residence, Lu Ming looked at the back of the Lu family. After a moment of thought, he moved and headed there.</p><p>There was a fruit forest behind the Lu family, and it was filled with fruit trees.</p><p>There were also small bridges, flowing water, pavilions, and lakes. The environment was very elegant.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the fruit forest and came to a small lake. An elder was fishing by the lake.</p><p>This old man was the Golden-robed elder sent by Lin Xueyi, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, to guard the Lu family.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your senses are really sharp. I was cultivating two days ago, and you could already sense the slight fluctuations I revealed.”</p><p>The gold-robed elder smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming thanks senior for coming to guard the Lu family!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>you don’t have to thank me. I’m just following orders. You deserve it. After all, the sect has let you down!</p><p>The Golden-robed elder sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent and did not speak.</p><p>The Golden-robed elder pondered for a moment and sighed, ” “Lu Ming, I hope you don’t blame the sect leader. In fact, he’s in a very difficult position. As the sect leader, he has to put the interests of the mystical sword sect above all else.”</p><p>senior, I don’t blame anyone. In this world, the weak are prey to the strong. If I have to blame someone, I can only blame myself for being too weak. However, one day, I will rule over all forces and families. I will make sure that the heavens can no longer cover my eyes!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He seemed to be talking to the old man but also to himself.</p><p>The old man was startled and seemed to be moved.</p><p>“No matter what, Lu Ming still has to thank senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists again and bowed to the elder. He then turned around and strode away.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s back as he left, the old man was in a daze. After a long time, he let out a long sigh.”Sect leader, perhaps you’ve made the wrong choice this time!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Ming left the fruit forest but did not leave fiery wind city immediately. Instead, he found a hidden place and entered the Supreme shrine to start cultivating.</p><p>Time passed and night fell. Lu Ming then left the Supreme shrine. He put on his black robe and bamboo hat and left the city. Then, he headed in the direction of the imperial capital.</p><p>The capital of the burning sun Empire was located at the center of the Empire, to the West of fiery wind city. It was more than 100000 miles away.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s current movement technique, it would take him more than twenty days to reach the imperial capital.</p><p>In the first three days, everything was calm. However, on the evening of the fourth day, Lu Ming, who was in a hurry, suddenly stopped.</p><p>That was because he felt a few waves of killing intent surrounding him.</p><p>Someone was trying to kill him!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming stomped his foot and his figure soared into the sky.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming charged forward, a sharp and cold sword aura pierced the spot where Lu Ming had been standing.</p><p>With a clang, the sword Qi left a deep hole in the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, seven or eight figures appeared from all directions like ghosts.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across.</p><p>There were a total of eight figures, all of them wearing black robes and masks.</p><p>It was a Silver Wolf mask.</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately recalled that this was the shadow Wolf Pavilion, one of the four major assassin organizations in the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>The Silver Wolf mask represented the Silver Wolf-level assassin of the shadow Wolf Pavilion.</p><p>five sixth grade great Martial Master and three seventh grade great Martial Master. The shadow Wolf Pavilion really thinks highly of me, Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>There were eight murderous sounds and eight extremely sharp sword Qi that were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s see who kills who?”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. At this moment of life and death, Lu Ming activated his Blood Meridian and an ancient shield appeared on his body.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the attacks from the other seven people. His spear turned into a ray of light and shot toward a sixth grade great Martial Master assassin from the shadow Wolf Pavilion.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>Seven consecutive attacks landed on Lu Ming’s body. Four of them were blocked by the shield.</p><p>The shield buzzed and trembled, but in the end, it was not broken.</p><p>However, the area that the shield could cover was limited and it could only block one direction. There were still three rays of sword aura that blasted Lu Ming.</p><p>The spirit-devouring bloodline had devoured 50% of the attack, but the remaining energy still made Lu Ming’s body tremble.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s attack had also erupted. The sixth grade great Martial Master expert was killed in one shot without even being able to let out a scream.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>A powerful devouring force appeared and devoured the Assassin’s blood essence.</p><p>“Damn it, didn’t they say that Lu Ming had fused with the soul of the Demon King and was half-crippled? How can it be so terrifying!”</p><p>it seems like the information was wrong. Let’s avoid that shield and attack Lu Ming’s body directly. We can kill him once the time limit of his Blood Meridian is over!</p><p>The assassins shouted.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
