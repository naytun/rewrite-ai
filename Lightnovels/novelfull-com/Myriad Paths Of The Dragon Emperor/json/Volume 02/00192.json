They were extremely fast.</p><p>As his figure flickered, sharp and vicious sword Qi dodged Lu Ming’s ancient shield and stabbed at him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He ignored the attacks from all directions and focused on a sixth grade great Martial Master assassin. He went all out to kill him.</p><p>The other party was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was even faster. He used his midair steps to the maximum and his body seemed to be weightless.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear came from above and smashed down heavily.</p><p>A hundred-meter long spear light as thick as a water tank smashed toward the assassin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Although the assassin tried his best to block, he was still sent flying and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>With a “Chi” sound, the spear ray pierced through the opponent’s heart like lightning.</p><p>He killed another person.</p><p>However, in the process, Lu Ming was hit seven to eight times. Even though he had the spirit-devouring bloodline, his face was still pale and there was blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He was injured.</p><p>At this moment, his aura was rapidly declining.</p><p>The time for the bloodline explosion was up.</p><p>“It’s time for his bloodline to explode!”</p><p>The remaining assassins were ecstatic.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming was like an immortal Demon God. He ignored his attacks and killed two people in a row, which really made them shudder with fear.</p><p>he’s already injured. In addition to his weakened strength, he won’t be able to escape.</p><p>A seventh grade great Martial Master assassin shouted.</p><p>The other five people moved in a flash and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“You were sent by the Duanmu family, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly asked.</p><p>“Hmph! You don’t care who sent us, we’re here to take your life.”</p><p>One of the assassins sneered, his voice cold.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Although the other party did not give in, he was sure that it was the Duanmu family.</p><p>Other than the Duanmu family, who else would want to kill him?</p><p>He had probably been targeted not long after he left fiery wind city.</p><p>Moreover, when Lu Ming first went to the mystical sword sect to participate in the assessment, he was assassinated by the ShadowWolf Pavilion in the mystical sword city.</p><p>Back then, his only enemies were the Duanmu family.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe that it was not the Duanmu family.</p><p>“Tell me, what is the relationship between the Duanmu family and your Shadow Wolf Pavilion? Or rather, what is the relationship between the shadow Wolf Pavilion and the mystical sword sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>you still have a lot of questions when you’re about to die. However, you’d better go to hell and ask the king of Hell. Kill!</p><p>A seventh grade great Martial Master assassin shouted coldly and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The other five people launched their attacks as well. The sword aura was like a net that covered Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not take it head-on. Instead, he used the midair steps to Dodge it.</p><p>However, the other party was a top-notch assassin and they had good teamwork. Lu Ming could not dodge them completely. If not for the ancient shield, he would have been injured.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming was still in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation was at the peak of the third grade Grandmaster realm. Under the condition that he did not activate his Blood Meridian, he could fight with a seventh grade Grandmaster and even suppress them.</p><p>However, the other party had three seventh grade great martial masters and three sixth grade great martial masters. They worked well together and Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>The six flashes of sword Qi completely enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear was brandished as he fought with them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A sixth grade great Martial Master assassin was swept away by the spear and was sent flying a hundred meters away. His face was pale.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also paid the price. A sword wound appeared on his body and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>He had just devoured the blood essence of two sixth grade great Martial Master realm assassins, and he was refining them while fighting.</p><p>He wanted to break through.</p><p>His cultivation had always been at the peak of the third grade great Martial Master realm, only a step away from the fourth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>As long as he could break through, his combat strength would increase greatly, and he would be able to fight back.</p><p>However, it was not easy to break through to the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The true Qi in his body was rumbling, but it was difficult to break through for the time being.</p><p>not enough. I don’t have enough energy. I have to kill one more person and devour one more person’s blood essence to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>He used all his strength and pounced towards the injured killer.</p><p>But how could the other assassins let him do as he wished?</p><p>They charged at him with all their might.</p><p>Not long after, two more wounds appeared on Lu Ming’s body. If he had not dodged in time, he would have been cut in half.</p><p>However, even though he was injured, he still got the result he wanted.</p><p>The sixth grade great Martial Master killer was hit by Lu Ming’s spear again.</p><p>This spear attack was even more overbearing.</p><p>Half of the other party’s body had almost exploded and was sent flying. He was already half-dead.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward without a care.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming paid the price of another wound, but he also ended the sixth grade great Martial Master killer with one shot.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>His spirit-devouring bloodline erupted with a powerful devouring power, devouring the other party’s blood essence in an instant.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In his bloodline, waves of energy immediately emerged.</p><p>“Break! Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. At the same time, he dodged the attacks of the remaining assassins with all his might.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming’s injuries became more serious and the situation became more disadvantageous to him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a loud boom suddenly erupted from his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura instantly bloomed.</p><p>Fourth grade great master realm, breakthrough.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and collided with a seventh grade Grandmaster killer.</p><p>The long spear and sword clashed, and the other party’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The sword bent, and his body was sent flying backward.</p><p>cultivation base breakthrough? how is that possible? ”</p><p>One of the assassins shouted.</p><p>“Now, let’s see who will kill who?”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed in rage. His aura was wild and his long spear swept out. The Spear’s radiance was like a mountain.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two sixth grade great Martial Master assassins were sent flying and slid for dozens of meters on the mountain. They were already half-dead and couldn’t move.</p><p>“Monster, what a monster. Let’s go.”</p><p>The remaining three seventh grade great Martial Master realm experts ‘expressions changed drastically. Without thinking, they actually turned around and ran.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He stared at one of them and chased after him.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The assassin who was being chased by Lu Ming bellowed in shock. He realized that he was not as fast as Lu Ming.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming caught up with him.</p><p>“I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>The assassin roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the fourth grade Grandmaster realm, he could even put up a fight against an ordinary eighth grade Grandmaster, let alone him.</p><p>He was completely suppressed. The assassin could only resist a dozen moves with all his might before he was pierced by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming devoured the Assassin’s blood essence. He then turned around and killed the two sixth grade great Martial Master assassins, devouring their blood essence.</p><p>“A storage ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that each of the assassins had a storage ring.
