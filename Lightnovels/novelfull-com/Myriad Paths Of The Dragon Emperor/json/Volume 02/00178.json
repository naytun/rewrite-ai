BOOM!</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family and ning Kong made their moves. Two terrifying attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming roared and leaped forward, sweeping his long spear horizontally.</p><p>The air exploded, the space trembled, and water-like ripples appeared.</p><p>With two loud bangs, the elder from the Duanmu family and ning Kong trembled and were sent flying backward.</p><p>Ning Kong was even worse off. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? What level is that demonic beast?”</p><p>Ning Kong cried out in disbelief.</p><p>with such a powerful beast soul, he won’t be able to hold on for long. He’ll explode from the power of the beast soul. Let’s attack together and make him explode faster!</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family roared.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was indeed under great pressure. The violent energy of the beast soul was rampaging in his body. It was extremely violent.</p><p>His muscles and bones were groaning as if they were about to burst at any moment.</p><p>Even his complete grade two body could not withstand it.</p><p>At this moment, a blood-red light flashed from his spine, and a powerful devouring force came out.</p><p>The devouring power had offset most of the violent tearing force.</p><p>This greatly reduced the pressure on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and strode forward. His target was Lu yunxiong.</p><p>He had to kill Lu yunxiong.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s face turned pale with fright. His legs trembled as he retreated.</p><p>At that moment, the elder from the Duanmu family and ning Kong arrived again.</p><p>The other members of the Duanmu family also joined in the attack. Beams of sword Qi, saber radiance, and palm force tore through the air and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sky-ripping Wolf!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his long hair dancing in the wind and his aura demonic.</p><p>As the spear stabbed out, wolf howls were heard. From the spear, huge black Wolves flew out.</p><p>This was the combat skill of the beast soul of the giant black Wolf. As it had been integrated with the beast soul, Lu Ming could use it for a short period of time.</p><p>The Black Wolves pounced at the Duanmu family’s experts with their claws.</p><p>“Ah!” Ah!</p><p>Miserable shrieks rose and fell as more than a dozen Duanmu family men were torn apart.</p><p>The elder of the Duanmu family and ning Kong were forced back by seven or eight Black Wolves.</p><p>“Kill! Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his spear and charged at the remaining Duanmu family members like a tiger charging into a flock of sheep.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and the air was filled with blood. At this moment, Lu Ming had turned into a god of death, slaughtering to his heart’s content.</p><p>Every time a spear shadow flashed, a person would be killed.</p><p>In just a few breaths, more than twenty people had been killed.</p><p>“Yaomo, yaomo, go!”</p><p>The remaining ten Duanmu family members were scared out of their wits and ran for their lives.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he killed a few more people.</p><p>retreat. Lu Ming is no match for us now. Let’s retreat first.</p><p>The old man from the Duanmu family was so frightened that his face was trembling. He roared repeatedly and then let out a long howl.</p><p>Gah gah!</p><p>Then, a bird cry came from the sky.</p><p>The two eagles flew down.</p><p>“You want to retreat? Stay here!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and swept his long spear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family and ning Kong joined forces and exchanged a blow with Lu Ming. However, the result was that the two of them were forced to retreat.</p><p>Ning Kong’s face turned pale and he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The old man from the Duanmu family used the force to retreat to Lu yunxiong’s side. He grabbed Lu yunxiong and shot up a hundred meters into the sky.</p><p>Even though a ninth grade great Martial Master couldn’t fly, he could still leap a few hundred meters high.</p><p>At this time, the two eagles had also reached this distance.</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family and Lu yunxiong landed on the back of a huge Condor. The Condor screeched and soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu yunxiong was Lu Yao’s father and Duanmu Lin’s future father-in-law. He had an extraordinary status, so of course he had to save him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, ning Kong took a step forward and his body rose high into the air as well, flying towards the other large Eagle.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. His body shot up into the sky like a cannonball and charged towards ning Kong.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>The long spear was like a mountain pressing down as it charged towards ning Kong.</p><p>“Blood butcher!”</p><p>die! ning Kong roared and spat out two mouthfuls of blood. He exerted all his strength and struck out a few times with a terrifying aura.</p><p>His blood and palm energy condensed to form several blood-red palm prints that flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Ning Kong was going all out. He had even used his secret skill.</p><p>However, it still could not stop Lu Ming.</p><p>The fusion of the beast soul at the peak of the martial arts Grandmaster realm made Lu Ming’s strength infinitely close to the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He stood at the peak of the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Ning Kong was no match for him at all. As the long spear struck down, the palm prints were destroyed one by one.</p><p>Ning Kong coughed up blood and flew back. Using this self-mutilating method, he finally landed on the back of the large Eagle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was falling.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re dreaming if you think you can kill me. You’ve killed so many people from the Duanmu family. They won’t let you off no matter what,”</p><p>Ning Kong laughed.</p><p>But as he laughed, he spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned as white as a sheet.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. Just you wait for the Duanmu family’s wrath. Your Lu family will be burned to ashes in this Fury!”</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family and Lu yunxiong were riding on a huge Eagle, floating thousands of meters in the air.</p><p>The old man from the Duanmu family said coldly.</p><p>The Duanmu family had suffered heavy losses in this battle. Even he himself had been forced to flee. This was a great humiliation, and the anger in his heart burned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just wait for your death!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong roared.</p><p>“Who allowed you to leave?”</p><p>All of a sudden, a cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth as he was falling. His feet suddenly stomped in the air and his body actually stopped falling. Instead, he rushed up.</p><p>At this moment, his strength had increased dramatically, and even the power of his soaring steps had increased by a large margin.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Ning Kong was shocked. He was only a few hundred meters above the ground. It was too late for him to fly up. He could only try his best to control the Eagle and escape.</p><p>The Eagle spread its wings and flew forward rapidly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. He held the spear in one hand and bent his body into a bow shape.</p><p>Then, the spear was thrown out.</p><p>With his body as a bow and his spear as an arrow, the long spear whistled like a bolt of lightning. It was unbelievably fast.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s all-out spear attack. In an instant, it crossed a distance of hundreds of meters and stabbed ning Kong.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ning Kong wailed, but it was too late for him to Dodge due to his severe injuries.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through ning Kong’s chest, bringing out a stream of blood.</p><p>There was a big hole in ning Kong’s chest, and his eyes were filled with extreme unwillingness and fear.</p><p>As for the Eagle, it was shocked by the killing intent of the spear. It wailed repeatedly and actually stopped in the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps back and crossed hundreds of meters in an instant, landing on the back of the large Eagle.</p><p>“Lu mang, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ning Kong cried out in despair. Then, his life force dissipated and he stopped breathing.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Above, Lu yunxiong and the elder from the Duanmu family were so scared that they almost peed their pants. They quickly urged the Eagle to fly in the direction of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his head and took a look. He circulated the essential Qi in his body and burst it out. The Eagle under his feet wailed and obediently followed his orders, falling down.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, are you alright?”</p><p>Li Ping quickly walked over and asked with concern.</p><p>“Mother, I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
