There was only a stone platform that Lu Ming had been unable to climb up previously.</p><p>Now, since the chanting had disappeared, could he step onto the third platform?</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked toward the third platform.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at the 99th step.</p><p>He took a step forward and without any obstruction, Lu Ming stepped onto the third platform.</p><p>“He’s really here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The first two platforms had a box each and it was of great help to Lu Ming. However, this platform was empty. What help could it be?</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and walked around. He did not find anything and finally came to the stone platform.</p><p>It was a very ordinary stone platform, square in shape, but there was a pit in the middle of the stone platform, which made it seem rather special.</p><p>“What’s this for? Was it an array base? Or?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully but still could not guess why.</p><p>“This pit is very similar to the size of a spiritual crystal.”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought. Then, his palm glowed and a spiritual crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>He decided to give it a try by placing the crystals into the pit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he approached the pit, there was a strong suction force from the pit. The spirit crystal in Lu Ming’s hand flew out of his hand and into the pit in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the pit trembled slightly, and a hazy light was emitted.</p><p>However, the light only flashed for a moment before it went silent again.</p><p>“What’s going on? There was clearly some movement just now. Could it be that there aren’t enough spirit crystals? then continue to add more.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and took out a piece of spiritual crystal.</p><p>He was also sucked into the pit, but just like before, the stone platform flashed and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to add spirit crystals.</p><p>Three, four …</p><p>Eight, nine …</p><p>When nine stones were added, a resplendent light shot up from the stone platform. Mysterious inscriptions began to appear around the stone platform, and these inscriptions continued to spread until they covered the entire platform.</p><p>In the end, a figure condensed on one side of the platform.</p><p>The figure’s face could not be seen clearly, and he was standing there upright.</p><p>“A human figure? What’s it for?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised and walked over.</p><p>“Do it, fight me!”</p><p>The figure suddenly spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. This figure’s face could not be seen clearly. It could be said that it was only condensed from energy. It could actually speak.</p><p>“Fight you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Do it, fight me!”</p><p>The figure repeated his words without any emotion.</p><p>“So it doesn’t have any spiritual intelligence.”</p><p>Lu Ming exhaled. His eyes flickered and he pondered for a moment. Then, he suddenly threw a punch.</p><p>The Supreme shrine could be said to be incomparably wondrous. There must be a reason for him to give it a try when the other party asked for it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force howled as Lu Ming executed the flame Dragon Fist.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming’s surprise, his opponent threw a punch at the same time. He was also using the flame Dragon Fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fists collided. Lu Ming felt a wave of scorching essential Qi, condensed and strong, surging toward him. He could not help but take three steps back.</p><p>He looked again and saw that the other party had also retreated three steps.</p><p>“The true war Dragon technique! The opponent is also using the true war Dragon technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>If one could imitate a battle technique, how could one imitate a cultivation technique?</p><p>However, the other party had really used the true war Dragon technique. Lu Ming would definitely not be mistaken.</p><p>“Let’s try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few consecutive punches, but the other party did the same, all of them using the flame Dragon Fist.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few punches in a row, and then each took a few steps back.</p><p>“There’s no mistake, it really is the true war Dragon technique.”</p><p>There was a look of disbelief in Lu Ming’s eyes. He felt that fighting with the other party was like fighting with himself.</p><p>“Then, what about the sword Art?”</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and a combat sword appeared. He performed the lustrous sword technique and slashed at the other party.</p><p>But at the same time, his opponent also condensed a combat sword in his hand and performed the lustrous sword technique.</p><p>In fact, when Lu Ming used his midair step, the other party would also use midair step.</p><p>“Fire gun art-lightning chase!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept his combat sword and took out his fiery Tung spear, unleashing his strongest combat power.</p><p>However, the other party had used the fire gun controlling art and his ability was not weaker than Lu Ming’s. It could be said that they were exactly the same, exactly the same as Lu Ming.</p><p>Whatever martial arts technique Lu Ming used, that figure would also use the same martial arts technique. Even the strength of their power was exactly the same.</p><p>Lu Ming finally confirmed that the other party was himself. It was another him condensed by the inscription array.</p><p>He was fighting with him.</p><p>“What a wonderful feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered. He had always been fighting with his enemies, but he had never fought with himself.</p><p>“Then let’s have a great battle!”</p><p>Since that was the case, Lu Ming could not be bothered to think about it. He relaxed his body and mind, exploded with all his strength, and began to fight the figure.</p><p>However, no matter what techniques he used, the other party would also use them. No matter how much power he erupted with, the other party was not inferior at all. It was completely him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the battle had gone on for more than 300 moves, and there was still no clear winner.</p><p>How could he win against him?</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s face revealed a surprised smile.</p><p>wonderful, wonderful! It turns out that there is such a flaw in my martial technique. And I have a bad habit when I use my spear!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>In the battle just now, he had discovered his own shortcomings.</p><p>He had exchanged more than 300 moves in a row, and he had tried his best to find the opponent’s weakness in each move so that he could defeat him.</p><p>Looking for the other’s weakness, wasn’t it the same as looking for his own weakness?</p><p>He realized that the spear technique that he had thought was perfect actually had a flaw. Furthermore, he had a bad habit when he attacked.</p><p>These were all very subtle places that were normally impossible to discover.</p><p>He could only discover it when he was fully focused on fighting him.</p><p>However, how could an ordinary person possibly fight against him?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that the figure condensed by the inscription array was more useful than the chanting of the Scriptures.</p><p>If he were to fight with him all the time, how much could he learn and comprehend martial arts techniques?</p><p>Lu Ming felt excited at the thought of it.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming recovered for a moment and continued to fight the figure.</p><p>Every time, Lu Ming would go all out and Exchange hundreds of moves with his opponent. He would only stop when his essential Qi was exhausted.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after three consecutive times.</p><p>That was because the figure had suddenly disappeared.</p><p>he’s gone. What happened? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He had just tasted the sweetness and he did not want to lose it just like that.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
