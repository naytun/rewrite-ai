You’ll create a miracle and flatten the Duanmu family in the future!”</p><p>Mu Lan said softly.</p><p>As for Feng Wu, she looked at Lu Ming’s back view with mixed feelings. This young man, who was about the same age as him, had joined the mystical sword sect and participated in the assessment together with her. However, he had created too many miracles.</p><p>In the past, she had a special feeling for Lu Ming. However, she suppressed that feeling after Lu Ming burst out with a dazzling light.</p><p>She knew that the gap between them was too big, and it would only get bigger in the future.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pang Shi’s fists were clenched tightly, and his eyes were filled with tears. His body was trembling non-stop.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the world is unfair, but I believe that you can overcome all obstacles and overcome all obstacles. In the future, I’ll wait for you to drink and discuss Dao with me!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun muttered to himself.</p><p>Beside him, Zhuo yirong grabbed Zhang Muyun’s hands tightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Yao stared at Lu Ming’s back in a daze. At this moment, she did not know why, but her heart was filled with complicated feelings.</p><p>On one hand, she hated Lu Ming. He was just a piece of trash that she had abandoned. How could he have such high talent?</p><p>He had even killed his father and crippled his big brother.</p><p>On the other hand, she was afraid. She was afraid that Lu Ming would really kill his way into the Duanmu family one day and destroy everything she had.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you should just go to hell!”</p><p>Finally, Lu Yao growled.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>The sect leader of the mystical sword sect, Lin Xueyi, let out a long sigh. She turned around, took a step forward, and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>Duanmu canghai looked in the direction where Lu Ming had disappeared, his murky old eyes glimmering.</p><p>pojun, this man is too extraordinary. He’s a rare genius. We can’t let him live. I can’t rest easy if he’s not dead!</p><p>Duanmu canghai solemnly said to Duanmu pojun.</p><p>Duanmu pojun’s heart trembled. His father actually regarded Lu Ming so highly. Was Lu Ming really such a big threat?</p><p>“Don’t worry, father. I’ll make the necessary arrangements.”</p><p>Duanmu pojun said as he bowed.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai nodded and took a step forward, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The crowd slowly dispersed. However, Lu Ming’s name was destined to shock every single person in the mystical sword sect after today’s incident. His name would be engraved in the history of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming left the mystical sword sect and flew into the distance at high speed.</p><p>Not long after, he charged into a mountain forest. At this time, the aura on his body was rapidly declining.</p><p>Although the Demon King’s soul was powerful, it had been holding on for so long that its power was exhausted.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>the backlash from the Demon King’s soul was too strong. Even with the spirit-devouring bloodline, my body almost couldn’t take it and was heavily injured.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>At this moment, his bones were slightly cracked, his muscles were torn by the powerful force, and a thick layer of blood scabs formed on his skin.</p><p>However, it was not as serious as Duanmu pojun and the rest had imagined. They thought that Lu Ming was already crippled.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming focused on healing his injuries, he would be fully recovered in a few days.</p><p>This was the uniqueness of the spirit-devouring bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the mystical sword sect, his eyes glimmering. at the end of the day, it’s all because I’m too weak. The Duanmu family is using their entire family to suppress the sect leader of the mystical sword sect. I’m no match for the entire Duanmu family.</p><p>but that’s only for now. It won’t be long before I prove that I, alone, can suppress an entire family and an entire force!</p><p>I want to become stronger. With a spear in hand, I want to dominate the world. That is my goal!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>“There’s also Qiu Yue. I can’t say goodbye to her this time. If she finds out that I’ve left the mystical sword sect, I wonder what she’ll do. That girl will probably cause a huge ruckus!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>“Forget it. We’ll meet again eventually. The most important thing now is to heal.”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine. He took out a healing pill and swallowed it, then began to channel his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming’s injuries had recovered by 80%.</p><p>“Mother must be worried about me coming out this time. I should go home now and see mother so that she can be at ease. After that, I’ll head to the imperial capital and try to think of a way to save father while I cultivate.”</p><p>After planning his journey, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and found a small river in the forest. He washed the blood off his body and changed into a black robe and a bamboo hat. He left the forest and headed towards fiery wind city.</p><p>The black robe and bamboo hat were the ones he had used in the past, and they had been kept in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>The Duanmu family would not let him off so easily, so he had to be careful when he moved.</p><p>He changed directions several times on his way to fiery wind city. He only returned to the Lu family after seven days.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’re fine. That’s great!”</p><p>At the first sight of Lu Ming, Li Ping’s tears flowed down and she hugged him tightly.</p><p>Lu Ming had gone after Lu yunxiong. During this period of time, she had been on tenterhooks every day, afraid that something had happened to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Mother, I’m fine. Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re alright, it’s good!”</p><p>Li Ping kept nodding her head and looked at Lu Ming carefully.</p><p>After that, he started talking to Li Ping about the Lu family’s situation over the past few days.</p><p>Previously, the 2nd to 6th branches of the Lu family had all surrendered to Lu yunxiong.</p><p>However, he did not expect Lu Ming to return. Not only did he kill almost all of the people that Lu yunxiong had brought, he even went after Lu yunxiong.</p><p>The people from the Lu clan’s branch were terrified when they saw the invincible experts lying dead in the courtyard.</p><p>It was unbelievable that Lu Ming was so powerful.</p><p>For the past few days, she had been trembling in fear, waiting for Lu Ming’s return and his judgment.</p><p>After chatting with Li Ping for a while, the remaining three core elders of the Lu clan came to pay their respects.</p><p>“The three of us pay our respects to the young master!”</p><p>The three core elders bowed and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three elders, there’s no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly helped the three core elders up.</p><p>The core elders still stood by the Lu family and Li Ping’s side at the moment of life and death. This made him very touched and respectful.</p><p>The three core elders looked at Lu Ming with undisguised joy in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had such powerful combat strength and was able to come back alive after chasing after Lu yunxiong. This meant that the Lu family was about to rise.</p><p>They were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>“Young master, the branch leaders of the second to sixth branches are waiting outside!”</p><p>One of the core elders said.</p><p>“Oh? Then let them wait. Come, three elders, let’s have some tea and chat.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and invited the three core elders to take a seat.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming asked about the Lu family’s situation and the details of Lu yunxiong’s visit.</p><p>Time flew by and two hours passed.</p><p>“Go, let them in!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed a maidservant.</p><p>The servant girl responded and went out. Not long after, five middle-aged men came in.</p><p>The five middle-aged men were the branch Masters of the second to sixth branches. They were also the elders of the Lu clan.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the young master!”</p><p>The five branch Masters hurriedly knelt down when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
