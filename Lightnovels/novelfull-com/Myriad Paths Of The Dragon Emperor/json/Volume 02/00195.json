This is good. You saved little Shan once, and I saved you once. We don’t owe each other anything.”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This woman was too arrogant and cold. At the same time, Lu Ming understood that the reason why she had saved him was that the lightning Leopard had discovered him.</p><p>“No matter what? This time, it’s you who saved me. Lu Ming is grateful. I’ll take my leave.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the young woman called out.</p><p>“What’s the matter, miss?” Lu Ming turned around.</p><p>“I heard you call me Xie nianqing. You’re his friend, right?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>“Friend?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but recall his relationship with Xie nianqing.</p><p>When Xie nianqing saw him, he would be considered lucky if he didn’t attack him. How could he be a friend?</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. I’ve only met Xie nianqing once. We can’t be considered friends.</p><p>I don’t care if you’re her friend or not. The next time you see her, help me tell her not to keep thinking about surpassing me, because that’s just a waste of time. It’s impossible.</p><p>The young woman said. Her voice was filled with confidence and a sense of superiority.</p><p>At the sight of this expression, Lu Ming did not know why but he felt uncomfortable.</p><p>“May I know your relationship with Xie nianqing? If I see her, I’ll definitely tell her. ”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his voice turning cold.</p><p>“I’m Xie nianjun, her sister!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“As expected, no wonder they look exactly the same!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, apart from their looks, the two sisters were very different in other aspects.</p><p>alright, the shadow Wolf Pavilion will definitely send more people to this place. I’m leaving, so you should leave too!</p><p>Xie nianjun said indifferently.</p><p>“Young lady, why don’t you go first? I’ll leave in a while.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Do as you please!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said indifferently. From the beginning to the end, he did not even look at the two silver Wolf killer’s bodies.</p><p>She turned around and left, her white dress fluttering like a fairy from the nine Heavens.</p><p>“Is something left behind by a seventh grade great Martial Master not worth mentioning in her eyes? But I’m not going to miss this.”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the two silver Wolf killers ‘corpses.</p><p>He devoured the blood essence of the two and took off their storage rings.</p><p>With a swift movement, Lu Ming left the place and headed deep into the forest.</p><p>In the mountain forest, ancient trees towered into the sky. Lu Ming walked for more than a hundred miles, then with a thought, he entered the Supreme shrine and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>Not long after, the two seventh grade Grandmaster’s blood meridians were refined by Lu Ming. His cultivation had also reached the middle stage of the seventh grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>After refining the blood essence, Lu Ming began to organize the storage rings that he had obtained from the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins.</p><p>There were a total of eight.</p><p>In the end, he received more than sixty million taels of silver.</p><p>Silver was only a small number. The most important thing was the spiritual crystals. After sorting them out, there were more than 23000 pieces. In addition to the previous ones, Lu Ming had nearly 40000 pieces of spiritual crystals.</p><p>Other than silver and spirit crystals, the rest were miscellaneous items that were not of much help to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eh? Is this a disguise?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming found a disguise among the clothes and other miscellaneous items.</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion was an assassin organization, and they often had to disguise themselves to assassinate people. It was normal for them to have a disguise on them.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that the disguise was of very good quality. It should be made from the skin of a demon beast.</p><p>Lu Ming put on his disguise.</p><p>There was no feeling at all, as if he was not wearing it, because it was very light.</p><p>“I wonder how the effect is? Let’s go out and take a look.”</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the Supreme shrine and found a pool in the forest. He shone his light on the pool and saw a dark-skinned, cold-looking young man in his twenties.</p><p>what an amazing disguise. He’s a completely different person.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that the disguise was tightly stuck to his face. He could not tell that he was wearing a disguise.</p><p>“Then, change it again.”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s body crackled and his bone armor wriggled. In the end, Lu Ming’s height actually increased by a little and his figure became a little burlier.</p><p>This was something that could only be done when Lu Ming’s physical body had reached complete second grade. It could cause slight changes to his physical body.</p><p>Although the change was not huge, with the help of the disguise, Lu Ming seemed to have completely changed into a different person. Even his closest people would not be able to recognize him.</p><p>good. This way, I won’t have to worry about the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s pursuit. Moreover, no one will recognize me if I go to the imperial capital. It’ll be more convenient for me to investigate my father’s matter.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming continued to head deep into the mountains.</p><p>According to his previous plan, he would cultivate while heading to the imperial capital.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had three main directions.</p><p>One was the comprehension of the force of fire, the other was the soaring steps, and the last was the ancient shield art.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Seven days later, a class 6 Lv 3 demonic beast covered in scales was pierced through the throat by Lu Ming’s spear. It fell to the ground with a roar.</p><p>His spirit-devouring bloodline activated and devoured the demonic beast’s blood essence. At the same time, the demonic pill appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming used all the blood essence to increase the level of his blood vessels, while the demonic core was used to increase his cultivation.</p><p>Just like that, he hunted demonic beasts as he made his way to the imperial capital.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>A Gale Sparrow flapped its wings in the air and fled frantically. Behind it, Lu Ming stepped on the void and followed closely behind it like lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be weightless as he floated in the air. After flying for a few hundred meters, Lu Ming’s figure slowly descended. After landing, Lu Ming stepped on the tip of a big tree and his body shot up into the sky like an arrow, chasing after the gale Sparrow.</p><p>The gale Sparrow was so frightened that it screeched and flew around desperately. However, no matter what it did, it could not get rid of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha …”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. After flying for a few miles, he landed on the peak of a mountain and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>After more than a month of hard work, Lu Ming’s midair steps had reached the peak of the fifth level. He was only a step away from the sixth level.</p><p>Just now, when he was chasing the gale Sparrow, he suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p>“The wind is invisible, but it is everywhere!”</p><p>“Wind, light and agile, erratic yet swift as lightning!”</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and started to comprehend quietly.</p><p>The principle of air walk was to use the genuine Qi in one’s body to resonate with the wind and air to achieve the purpose of riding the wind for a short time.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as he felt the breeze from the top of the mountain. A Green Breeze surrounded his body, spinning slowly. Lu Ming’s body was as light as a feather, as if he would be blown away by the wind at any time.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and took a step forward.</p><p>There was a cliff in front of him, but Lu Ming seemed to be walking on the ground. He walked forward step by step.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
