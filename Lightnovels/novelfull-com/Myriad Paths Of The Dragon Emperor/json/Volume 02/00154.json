It was covered with strange rocks, and among them, there were nine huge rocks, each of which was 50 to 60 meters high and shaped like a demon beast. That was why it was called the nine demon mountain.</p><p>At this moment, under a huge rock shaped like a tiger, there were more than two hundred people gathered.</p><p>There were both men and women, most of them middle-aged men or women.</p><p>The man was bare-chested and the woman was wrapped in animal skin. One look and one could tell they were from the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>A few Dongyi elders were surrounding the Tiger-shaped stone and smearing blood on it.</p><p>it’s the Dongyi people. They are inscribing inscriptions!</p><p>Chen Kuan shouted.</p><p>“Charge down and stop them!”</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The gale Eagle let out a long cry and rushed towards the Dongyi people.</p><p>“It’s the disciples of the mystical sword sect. Kill them! We can’t let them ruin our grand plan to open the ancestral ruins!”</p><p>kill! We, the Dongyi tribe, once ruled the burning sun Empire. We were extremely powerful. As long as we get the treasures in the ancestral relic, we will rise again and rule the burning sun Empire!</p><p>Loud roars were accompanied by sharp arrows.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh …</p><p>Hundreds of arrows streaked across the sky, flying towards the five windwalk Eagles.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s disciples slashed out sword Qi, saber radiance, and fist force to block the incoming arrows.</p><p>However, these arrows were shot by martial arts masters, and most of them were Grandmaster realm Masters. They were imbued with powerful true Qi, and although everyone tried their best to block them, many arrows still pierced through their defenses.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Many arrows hit the windwalk Eagle.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The mystical sword sect disciple’s expression changed drastically. He could only jump off the windwalk Eagle and use the light body technique to descend.</p><p>However, this would make him a target for the other party.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Dongyi people roared out and sent out another wave of arrows.</p><p>The mystical sword sect disciples bellowed as they resisted with all their might.</p><p>However, he was in the air and could not borrow any strength. He could only explode his true Qi and block it head-on.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>arghh! Arghh! Arghh! screams rang out. Five or six disciples with weaker cultivation were shot through the body, heart, and other parts of their bodies. They fell to the ground while screaming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s high-Air Step revealed its mysterious power. His feet stepped on the air as if he was stepping on a physical object. A force was produced and Lu Ming’s figure fluttered, dodging several arrows.</p><p>However, he had only cultivated it to the third level and could not last long.</p><p>But it was enough.</p><p>With a few leaps, Lu Ming charged straight at the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Another wave of arrows shot over like meteors chasing after the moon. The arrows pierced through the air with a sharp and terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and more than ten arrows in front of him were swept away.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt a slight numbness in his wrist.</p><p>A few more screams came from the sky. A few more people from the mystical sword sect had been shot.</p><p>However, they were already close to the Dongyi people.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill all these Eastern wasteland barbarians!”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect bellowed and launched powerful attacks.</p><p>The Dongyi people put away their bows and arrows, pulled out their sabers, and slashed out a pale blade light.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a series of explosions, the disciples of the mystical sword sect used the force of their fall to offset the force of their fall. They landed on the ground and began to fight with the Dongyi experts.</p><p>He had to admit that the Dongyi tribe had sent quite a number of powerful cultivators this time. At least a hundred of them were at the level of great martial masters.</p><p>The others were also high-level martial masters.</p><p>However, the disciples of the mystical sword sect were disciples of a large sect, after all. Their combat strength was still higher than ordinary people. For a moment, the battle was in a stalemate.</p><p>“You guys hold on, the ancestral ruins are about to open.”</p><p>An Eastern Barbarian old man shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The battle between the two sides was extremely intense.</p><p>There were six or seven fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts in the Dongyi tribe. Chen Kuan and the others were completely entangled.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and three Dongyi men, who were seventh grade master realm and above, were sent flying. Their bones were broken and they were no longer breathing.</p><p>“Little bastard, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A Dongyi man in his fifties slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear out and exchanged a blow with the other party.</p><p>The two of them were forced to retreat.</p><p>“Fourth grade great master realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The other party was even more shocked. He saw that Lu Ming was only a first grade great Martial Master and thought that he would be able to deal with him with one slash. He did not expect that they would be evenly matched with one move.</p><p>“Genius, the mystical sword sect’s peerless genius. Good, killing such a genius is enough to make the mystical sword sect’s heart ache.”</p><p>The burly man licked his lips as a brutal look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The Dongyi man slashed more than ten times in a row. The pale blade light covered Lu Ming’s vital parts.</p><p>“Fire dance!”</p><p>With a flash of the spear, flame flowers appeared, beautiful yet dangerous.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of rapid explosions rang out, and the flower of flames dissipated. The opponent’s blade light was also destroyed.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming’s long spear was like lightning, piercing towards the other party’s throat.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The saber in his opponent’s hand began to spin, turning into a snow-white full moon formed by the saber Light. Lu Ming’s long spear was thrust forward, but it was blocked with a clang.</p><p>“Hunter’s eighteen strikes!”</p><p>The Dongyi tribe man charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming also charged forward with his spear. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Gradually, Lu Ming gained the upper hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had the momentum of fire. With the addition of the flaming gun technique, his attacks were like volcanic eruptions. Coupled with his extremely condensed essential Qi, he was extremely violent. His opponent was only at the early stage of the fourth grade Grandmaster realm and he was gradually losing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the giant stone in the shape of a Tiger suddenly emitted a bright light.</p><p>haha, the ancestral ruins have opened!</p><p>An old man laughed.</p><p>The Tiger-shaped stone glowed brightly and slowly formed a huge light door that was ten meters tall and three meters wide.</p><p>“Kill them all, then we’ll head to the ruins!”</p><p>The Dongyi elders, who had been smearing the blood of demonic beasts, roared. They released powerful auras and pounced on the disciples of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Among the five people, two of them were actually fifth grade great martial masters, while the other three were fourth grade great martial masters.</p><p>Once they joined the battle, the mystical sword sect was immediately at a disadvantage. In just a few breaths, five to six mystical sword sect disciples had been killed.</p><p>“Charge, charge towards that light!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted.</p><p>Since he couldn’t beat them, he might as well rush towards the things that the other party valued. Perhaps there might be a chance for a turnaround.</p><p>“Right, charge!”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect roared as they charged toward the door of light.</p><p>“Damn it, stop them!”</p><p>As expected, the Dongyi people were panicking. They shouted and tried their best to stop the disciples of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming also abandoned his opponent and rushed toward the light door.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
