It’s really him.”</p><p>this is going to be interesting. He tie’s body is extremely tough and his close combat ability is extremely strong. Lu Ming seems to have cultivated the body-tempering path as well. Between the two of them, who do you think will win? ”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. It’s been a few months since he tie won eight consecutive victories. He must be stronger now. However, Lu Ming, this year’s newcomer King, has risen too quickly. It’s really shocking. No one knows if he has any trump cards. Therefore, it’s hard to say for sure what will happen in this battle.”</p><p>“Yup! I didn’t come here in vain.”</p><p>Everyone was staring at the fighting ring with great interest.</p><p>Lu Ming had exceeded everyone’s expectations. He was just a new disciple this year, but he had won eight consecutive battles.</p><p>As long as he won two more matches, he would be able to enter the bronze ranking. This was a rare sight in the history of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>What everyone was concerned about was whether he could win or not. Would he tie be able to stop him?</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming and he tie stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you were saved by Mu Lan last time. Let’s see who can save you this time.”</p><p>He tie revealed a cruel smile.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his forehead speechlessly and said, ” “Look, here you go again. I said birds of a feather flock together. Did Yao Tianyu teach you this? Let me teach you. It’s the right of the strong to say such words. The weak have no right to say such things.”</p><p>Hahaha …</p><p>There was a burst of laughter from the surroundings. Lu Ming’s words were obviously mocking Yao Tianyu. This was too interesting.</p><p>“You’ll soon understand who’s the strong one!”</p><p>He tie’s expression was extremely dark as he spoke.</p><p>“Oh, really? What you’re good at is nothing more than your body and your fists. Then I’ll use my fists to compete with you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Then, he waved his hand and the giant sword disappeared.</p><p>He was facing he tie with his bare hands.</p><p>This action caused the scene to fall into a clamor again.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming isn’t using any weapons. He wants to fight he tie with his fists?”</p><p>that’s not wise. That’s not wise. Lu Ming has underestimated his enemy. Isn’t he using his own weakness against the enemy’s strength? ”</p><p>“He’s still young, so he’s still too careless.”</p><p>“I don’t think so. Lu Ming doesn’t seem like an unwise person.”</p><p>……</p><p>On the East grandstand.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming is really courting death. I didn’t expect him to be so stupid to compete with he tie in fist combat.</p><p>“Stupid, I thought he was a big Shot.”</p><p>Beside Yao Tianyu, the red-robed young man and the others laughed mockingly.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s eyes flickered, and his brows furrowed slightly, but he did not say anything.</p><p>On the fighting ring, he tie was ecstatic when he saw that Lu Ming had put away his sword. He shouted,”Lu Ming, you said it yourself. Don’t go back on your word later.”</p><p>Initially, he was only sixty to seventy percent confident that he could defeat Lu Ming. However, now that Lu Ming had abandoned his combat sword, he immediately felt that he had a hundred percent confidence that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>How could he not be happy?</p><p>Lu Ming, this was the typical rhythm of seeking death.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I, Lu Ming, never go back on my word. But don’t admit defeat later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with an inexplicable smile on his lips.</p><p>“Don’t worry. If I admit defeat today, I’ll roll down from here.”</p><p>He tie said immediately, as if he was afraid that Lu Ming would go back on his words.</p><p>However, in the stands, Yao Tianyu’s brows furrowed even more. He did not know why, but when he saw Lu Ming’s calm and composed expression, the bad feeling in his heart grew stronger.</p><p>The judge announced the start of the match.</p><p>“Haha, take this!”</p><p>He tie roared, his muscles bulging. There was a layer of faint black light on his skin, making his muscles look like pieces of black iron. He tie looked like a steel monster.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>He tie strode forward, each step covering a distance of 10 meters. Every step he took on the fighting ring made a violent boom.</p><p>Within a few breaths, he tie was in front of Lu Ming. His huge fist was aimed at Lu Ming’s head, and a cold smile hung on his face.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw a punch at he tie’s fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their fists collided with each other, creating a loud boom.</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat as they stared at the two of them.”Can Lu Ming withstand it?”</p><p>However, they immediately knew the answer.</p><p>A muscular figure was forced back five to six steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>The figure was he tie while Lu Ming’s body did not even shake.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>The air seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>Almost everyone’s mouths were wide open, big enough to stuff a duck egg in. Their eyes were so wide that they almost burst.</p><p>This was too unbelievable. Lu Ming had abandoned his weapon and used his fist against he tie’s fist. He had actually forced he tie to retreat five to six steps with one punch?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming also cultivated fist techniques? could it be that Lu Ming’s physical body was stronger than he tie’s?</p><p>However, that was impossible. He had never heard of Lu Ming cultivating the path of body tempering. Otherwise, he would not have been in such a sorry state more than three months ago.</p><p>However, how could his physical body be cultivated to such a level in just over three months?</p><p>Unless they had obtained some heavenly treasure.</p><p>“Argh! Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>He tie was knocked back by Lu Ming’s punch. Looking at the shocked gazes around him, he felt extremely humiliated and hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>He let out an angry roar, put his hands on his waist, and put on a pair of metal boxing gloves. Then, he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of charging out, his bloodline burst out.</p><p>The Level 4 giant bear bloodline had increased his strength by another 40%.</p><p>“Then I’ll play with you.”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips had been curled into an apathetic smile the entire time. With a single thought, his strength increased by a few points and he threw a punch at he tie.</p><p>Using his bare hands against he tie’s spirit weapon gloves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their fists collided for the second time.</p><p>An even more violent explosion was heard. Then, a powerful force burst out from the place where the two fists hit. The force was like a Gale, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>Some of the disciples who were closer were almost swept up by the wind.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>It was noisy. The disciples all used their cultivation to block the wind.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming and he tie’s bodies swayed slightly.</p><p>They were equally matched.</p><p>“He blocked it. Lu Ming blocked it again.”</p><p>“Unbelievable. Lu Ming didn’t even activate his Blood Meridian and he’s empty-handed, while he tie has already activated his Blood Meridian and is wearing a spirit weapon glove.”</p><p>“He’s too powerful. Lu Ming is too powerful. As long as he can hold on for two minutes and wait for he tie’s Blood Meridian power to be exhausted, he’ll definitely win.”</p><p>……</p><p>“Not bad, let’s do it again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>“Violent bear fist, go to hell!”</p><p>He tie roared and punched out again.</p><p>The shock in his heart was stronger than anyone else’s. He knew that he had to end the battle as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would really be defeated in two minutes.</p><p>He tie exploded with all his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch. This time, he used another portion of his strength.</p><p>In the end, he tiechan staggered backward.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
