This old man’s head was already kicked by a donkey!</p><p>Yan LAN laughed.</p><p>sect leader, you’ve seen it for yourself. This kid has no respect for his elders. It’s clear how low his character is. If he’s allowed to live in this world, he’ll be a scourge. We must kill him today!</p><p>Duanmu pojun said to the sect leader.</p><p>The sect leader of the mystical sword sect frowned. Lu Ming was, without a doubt, a top genius. How could he ask to kill him?</p><p>However, if he didn’t kill them, how would he answer to the Duanmu family?</p><p>“Sect leader, Lu Ming killed thirty-five master realm experts, fifteen Grandmaster realm experts, and even the chief elder of the ninth grade Grandmaster realm. These people were all elites of the mystical sword sect and had given their all for the sect. Yet, they died at the hands of a junior disciple. If we don’t kill Lu Ming, I’m afraid our hearts will turn cold!”</p><p>“That’s right, sect leader. Even if those people from before were at fault, the dozen or so martial grandmasters behind them were only there to guard The White Tiger Hall and the sect. He was killed mercilessly. Lu Ming must be killed!”</p><p>A few silver-robed elders from The White Tiger Hall also stepped forward.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes could not help but look at the square.</p><p>There were more than a dozen corpses lying there, and the blood had not dried yet.</p><p>Yan LAN furrowed his brows. It was reasonable for Lu Ming to kill those people who had barged into the Lu family previously. However, it was hard to explain the situation with these ten over people.</p><p>“They stopped me from killing the real murderer. I warned them, but they asked for it.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. Lu Ming, according to what you’ve said, if the sect leader stops you, you’ll kill him too, right?”</p><p>Duanmu pojun laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and did not say anything. He could not refute this.</p><p>“This matter was caused by your Duanmu family. Lu Ming was also trying to protect his family and his mother. In a moment of desperation, he used more force. This is human nature. It’s excusable. He doesn’t deserve to die!”</p><p>Yan LAN said.</p><p>“Yan LAN, you’re determined to protect Lu Ming, right?”</p><p>Duanmu pojun said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Yan LAN said firmly.</p><p>“Then Let’s Have a Battle today. Let’s see how long you can cover for Lu Ming.”</p><p>Duanmu pojun roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu pojun and Yan Lan’s auras exploded forth as they clashed in the air.</p><p>The sect leader frowned.</p><p>“Jun po, stop!”</p><p>An old voice sounded. Then, with a flash of golden light, a white-haired old man appeared in the air with a walking stick.</p><p>This old man was wearing a golden robe. It was obvious that he was a golden-robed elder.</p><p>“Father, why have you come out of seclusion?”</p><p>Duanmu pojun cried out in surprise when he saw the old man.</p><p>When the others heard this, they were all shocked.</p><p>This person was actually Duanmu pojun’s father?</p><p>“This is troublesome!”</p><p>Yan LAN muttered as he furrowed his brows.</p><p>Below, Mu Lan’s eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>Duanmu pojun’s father, Duanmu canghai, was the previous patriarch of the Duanmu family and the previous headmaster of The White Tiger Hall. Although he was now a golden-robed elder of the mystical sword sect, his cultivation was extremely terrifying and unfathomable, surpassing the average golden-robed elder.</p><p>It was said that in recent years, he had been cultivating in seclusion in order to break through the Supreme King’s realm.</p><p>“Greetings, old chief!”</p><p>Everyone from the Duanmu family stepped forward and saluted.</p><p>“Old hai, why have you come out of seclusion? is there a need to alarm you about this matter?”</p><p>The sect leader’s expression changed slightly before he smiled.</p><p>Duanmu canghai let out a dry smile and said, ” sect leader, if I don’t come out and take a walk, the people of my Duanmu family will all be killed!</p><p>The sect leader’s expression changed slightly. He smiled and said, ” “Old Hai’s words are too serious, there’s no need for this!”</p><p>“I’ve already heard about this. First of all, the Duanmu family is at fault for being bewitched. However, Lu Ming was too ruthless. Not only did he kill all of them, but he also went to The White Tiger Hall and killed more than ten martial grandmasters. This matter can not be forgiven. He may be spared from death, but he can not escape punishment. I suggest that we expel him from the sect.”</p><p>Duanmu canghai said.</p><p>“No!” Yan LAN took a step forward and firmly objected.</p><p>this old man is so scheming. After kicking Lu Ming out of the sect, without the protection of the sect, they will definitely send people to hunt Lu Ming down!</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>“Old hai, Lu Ming has the heart of a teenager. He’ll be able to make it easily, but he shouldn’t be expelled from the sect!”</p><p>The sect leader said.</p><p>“Haha, sect leader, it seems like you still value talents. However, as you can see, Lu Ming has forcefully fused with the soul of the Demon King. Even if he temporarily gains power, his Foundation is crippled. He will no longer be a genius but a cripple.”</p><p>Duanmu canghai laughed.</p><p>The sect leader frowned and pondered.</p><p>After all, the Duanmu family was at fault in this matter. Lu Ming was only avenging his family. Many young disciples would definitely be on Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>If they were to expel Lu Ming from the sect like this, many disciples would be bitterly disappointed.</p><p>Seeing the sect leader’s hesitation, Duanmu canghai’s face turned cold and he said slowly, ” “Sect leader, the Duanmu family has done our best for the mystical sword sect for thousands of years, and we’ve made countless contributions. Today, so many of our people have been killed by a junior. If you don’t expel him from the sect, then let the Duanmu family leave!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This sentence was like a Thunderbolt, exploding in everyone’s mind and causing a shock.</p><p>This was a threat. Duanmu canghai was threatening the sect leader with the entire Duanmu family.</p><p>“Despicable, shameless!”</p><p>Pang Shi, Mu Lan, and the others growled.</p><p>The sect leader’s expression also changed greatly. He became extremely serious and said, ” “Old hai, your words are too much!”</p><p>Even though he said that, the sect leader had to take it seriously.</p><p>Over the years, the Duanmu family had grown stronger and stronger. Almost the entire White Tiger Hall had become their territory.</p><p>If they lost the Duanmu family, the mystical sword sect would definitely suffer a huge blow and its strength would be greatly reduced.</p><p>As the sect leader, he had to treat this seriously.</p><p>“Damn it, this old man!”</p><p>Yan LAN clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Duanmu pojun and the other disciples of the Duanmu family sneered in their hearts. They would like to see how Lu Ming could avoid this calamity.</p><p>Duanmu canghai’s lips curled into a cunning smile as he waited for the sect leader’s answer.</p><p>After pondering for a while, the sect leader took a deep breath. His eyes flashed as he looked at Lu Ming and said slowly,”Lu Ming, even though there’s a reason for this, you’ve gone too far by killing dozens of people from The White Tiger Hall. They were all from the same sect. This is a grave crime.”</p><p>The sect leader’s dignified voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Sect leader, you can’t!”</p><p>Yan LAN roared.</p><p>“Sect leader, what’s wrong with Lu Ming avenging his family? What crime?”</p><p>Mu Lan also shouted.</p><p>if that’s the case, doesn’t that mean that the Duanmu family can kill our family in the future and we can’t take revenge? what kind of logic is that? ”</p><p>Pang Shi also roared, his voice shaking the entire scene.</p><p>The eyes of many disciples flickered. Clearly, they agreed with pang Shi’s statement.</p><p>impudent! You dare to question the sect leader’s will? you’ll be punished as well!</p><p>Duanmu pojun roared. His voice was so loud that Mu Lan, pang Shi, and the others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
