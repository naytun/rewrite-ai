Yet, he had already cultivated a black grade high level martial arts technique to the state of being one with martial arts. If this news were to spread, many people’s jaws would drop.</p><p>“It seems that I’m indeed a peerless genius!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed smugly.</p><p>In the past, he had the sound of chanting, which allowed him to cultivate his martial arts techniques at a rapid speed. However, the sound of chanting had disappeared. Lu Ming only fought with him every day, and his cultivation speed did not slow down. It was clear that Lu Ming’s own talent was extremely shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took one step at a time. His figure was like a bolt of lightning, crossing the void. In the blink of an eye, he was a few hundred meters away.</p><p>However, there was no sign of him falling. Lu Ming continued to walk in the air. There was a faint feeling of lightness and uncertainty about his body.</p><p>“Wind force, is this the wind force?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Previously, when he had comprehended and broken through the sky steps, he had taken advantage of the situation and comprehended a little bit of wind force.</p><p>Although it was only a superficial one, Lu Ming was already ecstatic.</p><p>Normal people only had the right to comprehend it at the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Fire Force had already reached the initial success stage and he had even comprehended the second kind of energy.</p><p>Wind force.</p><p>In the future, when Wind and Fire were combined, the power would definitely be even more shocking.</p><p>He circulated the force of the wind and combined it with the soaring steps, causing the power of the soaring steps to reach an astonishing level.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and walked for a full two kilometers before he slowly landed.</p><p>Originally, even if he had cultivated his sky steps to the sixth level, it would be considered good if he could walk a thousand meters in the air.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>All of a sudden, a screech came from below. Then, a golden Goshawk soared up. With a flap of its wings, golden feathers shot toward Lu Ming like golden divine swords.</p><p>a class 7 Lv 3 demonic beast, the Golden-feathered Goshawk. Finally, I’ve encountered a decent demonic beast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The next moment, two ancient shields appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The Golden feathers hit the shield, making a sound of metal hitting metal and sparks flying in the air.</p><p>However, the shield in front of Lu Ming did not move.</p><p>“Kill! Wind and Fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The spear carried a scorching aura. At the same time, with the help of the momentum of the wind, the wind helped the fire, causing Lu Ming’s long spear to completely turn into a flaming long spear.</p><p>The spear broke through all obstacles and pierced into the Golden-feathered Goshawk’s chest.</p><p>The violent energy instantly tore the Golden feather Goshawk’s internal organs apart. The Golden feather Goshawk let out a sharp cry and stopped breathing.</p><p>He had killed a class 7 Lv 3 demonic beast with one spear strike.</p><p>“The power of the combination of Wind and Fire is actually so shocking?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with surprise.</p><p>Right now, wind force was only at the beginning, and he had only comprehended a tiny bit of it. It could be imagined that if his comprehension of wind force became more and more profound, when combined with Fire Force, the power it displayed would definitely be greater.</p><p>“However, Wind and Fire are supposed to complement each other, which is why they can be combined so easily. If they were two opposing forces, it would not be so easy to combine them.”</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear.</p><p>Moreover, this was only a preliminary combination. They were only supporting each other and not a true fusion.</p><p>now, I finally have some ability to protect myself when facing a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>In the past, when he faced a martial arts Grandmaster, he would not be able to escape even if he used all his strength. However, Lu Ming had more confidence now.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate as he made his way to the imperial capital.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry. Hence, he spent another half a month before he arrived at the imperial capital.</p><p>In front of them, a huge object appeared. It was boundless and stretched across the world as if it had existed since ancient times.</p><p>When he walked in, he realized that it was even bigger.</p><p>The Black City wall was 100 meters tall and extended into the sky.</p><p>He couldn’t even see how long the city wall was. It seemed to be endless.</p><p>It was said that the capital of the blazing sun Kingdom was a hundred miles long in the East, West, South, and North. It was extremely majestic.</p><p>On the city wall stood rows of soldiers in armor.</p><p>Every soldier exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>The capital of the burning sun Empire was the largest city in the Empire. It was the core of the imperial family’s power.</p><p>It was said that 800 years ago, the burning sun royal family was the most powerful force in the sun Empire. All the major sects had to bow down to the royal family.</p><p>At that time, the burning sun royal family ruled the world. The burning sun Empire ruled over ten thousand cities, and their strength was at its peak.</p><p>Unfortunately, the burning sun Empire’s royal family had internal strife and endless wars.</p><p>Later on, their strength weakened, and the sect rose.</p><p>Especially the ten direction Sword School, they had taken control of the royal family and their strength had increased to a terrifying level. The burning sun royal family would not be able to make a comeback.</p><p>Right now, the people of the blazing sun Empire only cared about the five great sects. The influence of the imperial family was already very weak.</p><p>Lu Ming walked along the main road and entered the imperial capital.</p><p>The streets of the imperial capital were extremely wide, and even if ten carriages were to travel side by side, it would not be a problem.</p><p>On both sides of the street, there were shops.</p><p>Elixir stores, weapon refining pavilions, and so on.</p><p>It was not something that fiery wind city could compare to. Even profound sword city could not compare to it. The streets were bustling with people.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around curiously as he walked forward.</p><p>the capital of the burning sun Kingdom is so big. How should I investigate my father’s news? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>For a moment, he had no clue at all.</p><p>“Hua Chi said that he’s in the imperial capital, so perhaps he’s someone from the imperial capital. If I can find him and ask him about the specific situation in the imperial capital and the division of power, it’ll be of great help to my next operation.”</p><p>However, what made Lu Ming dumbfounded was that he had no idea how to find Hua Chi.</p><p>forget it. There’s a lot of information in the restaurant. Let’s go to the restaurant first. We’ll find out more information while we eat.</p><p>Lu Ming was planning to look for a restaurant when the streets were in chaos.</p><p>“Not good, Hua Jie is here to walk his Warbeast again.”</p><p>“What? Hurry up and run!”</p><p>On the streets, the crowd was in chaos. The crowd ran away, all of them with fear on their faces.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening beast’s roar was heard.</p><p>Then, at the end of the street, a huge creature was running towards them.</p><p>It was a demonic beast, three meters tall and six to seven meters long. Its body was covered in fiery red scales, and it was running wildly on the street with a murderous aura.</p><p>first class third level, armor-breaking beast!</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the demonic beast’s origin and level at one glance.</p><p>“Haha, charge, hurry up and charge!”</p><p>Behind the armor-breaking beasts, there was a group of people on horses, shouting loudly.</p><p>As the armor-breaking beast ran, the pedestrians on the street retreated at the sight of it. Even some experts at the Grandmaster realm and above had their expressions change and quickly retreated to the side.</p><p>“Mother, mother, where are you? Ling ‘er is scared!”</p><p>Suddenly, in the middle of the street, a little girl’s cry rang out.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
