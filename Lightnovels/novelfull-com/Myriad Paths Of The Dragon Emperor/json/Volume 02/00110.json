I’ve heard this little girl LAN ‘er mention you so many times, and I’ve long wanted to come and see you. En, en, now that I’ve seen you, you’re indeed not bad, you can be called a Dragon among men.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall’s Dean sized Lu Ming up carefully, stroking his white beard and nodding his head.</p><p>“You’re too kind, director!”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>However, he was still a 16-year-old teenager after all. To be praised by such a Big Shot, he was still happy in his heart, and his face could not help but reveal a smile.</p><p>“Grandpa, don’t praise him. Look at how proud he is!”</p><p>Mu Lan glanced at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, are you jealous? haha!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s jealous. Boy, now that you’re on the bronze list, you’re getting bolder, aren’t you?”</p><p>Mu Lan gritted her teeth and glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>On the side, Feng Wu, pang Shi, Hua Chi, and the others couldn’t help but burst out laughing, their faces turning red.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, what’s wrong with me being proud of the Dean’s praise? This is the principal. Shouldn’t I be proud to be able to get the principal’s approval? Isn’t that right, director?”</p><p>Lu Ming said and looked at the Dean.</p><p>hahaha, little guy, I like your true nature. You should be proud of yourself, but you can’t underestimate your enemy later.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall chief laughed.</p><p>“Thank you for your reminder, headmaster.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists again.</p><p>“Detestable!” Mu Lan gritted her teeth and left with the Vermillion Bird Hall chief. They returned to their seats.</p><p>Puchi …</p><p>After Mu Lan left, Feng Wu and the others couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out laughing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me tell you. Sister Mu Lan is very vengeful. You have to be careful in the future.”</p><p>Feng Wu said, laughing.</p><p>All of a sudden, she saw Mu Lan’s fierce gaze from not far away. Her expression immediately turned serious and her smile disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked by the speed of the change.</p><p>The other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples cast envious looks at Lu Ming.</p><p>The head of the Vermillion Bird Hall had come to see him in person and even praised him in public. What an honor!</p><p>This meant that the Vermillion Bird Hall’s Dean admired Lu Ming. This was a treatment that even Cheng Feiyu, who was ranked in the top ten of the Vermillion Bird Hall’s bronze ranking, did not have.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Bzzzz …</p><p>At this moment, a few rays of light suddenly flew out from the depths of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The dazzling light pierced through the void and arrived above the fighting ring in an instant.</p><p>“Welcome, sect leader!”</p><p>As soon as they arrived, the deans of the four halls and the silver-robed elders got up and packed their bags.</p><p>“Sect master?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked that the sect master had arrived. They quickly stood up and said,”Welcome, sect leader!”</p><p>More than 50000 disciples shouted in unison, their voices shaking the world.</p><p>“No need to be so polite, sit down!”</p><p>A calm and clear voice sounded.</p><p>The voice seemed to come from the sky, but it also seemed to have come from everyone’s ears. It was very strange.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and saw seven figures in the sky.</p><p>The person in the lead looked to be in his forties. He had a handsome face and long black hair. He was dressed in a snow-white robe as he stood in the air. It was as if he was the center of the entire world.</p><p>He did not emit any aura, but in Lu Ming’s eyes, he was like an endless ocean, unfathomable and giving off a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“Is this the sect master of the mystical sword sect? One of the overlords of the burning sun Empire, flying snow God sword, Lin Xueyi.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Behind the sect leader of the mystical sword sect were two gold-robed elders and four silver-robed elders.</p><p>Then, the sect leader and the six elders of the mystical sword sect flew down and landed on the highest point of the northern stands. That place was specially prepared for the sect leader and the others.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, right? let’s start!”</p><p>The sect leader of the mystical sword sect announced with a wave of his hand.</p><p>As soon as the sect leader finished speaking, a silver-robed elder flew up to the fighting ring and began to introduce the rules of the competition.</p><p>The rules were simple. There were 60 people in total, and they would be Assigned Numbers according to their previous ranking.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had killed Yao Tianyu and naturally replaced his ranking. He was ranked 51st and his number was 51.</p><p>The sixty people would fight in pairs and draw lots to decide their opponents.</p><p>The winner would enter the top 30, and the loser would be eliminated.</p><p>However, after the top 30 were decided, there would be another challenge.</p><p>The elders of the four halls and the elders of the sect would discuss together and choose ten powerful geniuses to challenge the thirty geniuses who had advanced earlier.</p><p>As long as they won, they would be able to replace the other party and enter the top 30.</p><p>This was for the sake of fairness, because some people might be very strong, but their luck was bad at the beginning, and they would draw the geniuses in the top few places, so they would lose somewhat unjustly.</p><p>This way, they could avoid the stronger geniuses from being eliminated early due to bad luck.</p><p>This was related to the interests of the four halls, so it was natural to be fair.</p><p>The rules were the same for the top 15 from the top 30. The top 10 would be chosen and the final ranking would be decided by a round of battles.</p><p>There were many rewards for entering the top ten. Other things aside, Lu Ming was very envious of the contribution points.</p><p>all right, I’m sure everyone knows the rules. Now, the disciples on the bronze rank can come up to draw lots.</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked onto the fighting ring.</p><p>People from the four great academies walked up to the fighting ring. In the end, there were 60 people in total.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on these sixty people.</p><p>They would be the main characters for the next few days.</p><p>look, that’s Zhang Muyun. He’s ranked first on the Azure Dragon Hall’s bronze ranking. He’s so handsome, talented, and handsome. I wish I could marry him.</p><p>stop dreaming. I heard that Zhang Muyun and the seventh-ranked Zhuo yirong are a couple. You can stop dreaming.</p><p>“Ah? Look, that’s Lu Ming, this year’s newcomer King. He rushed into the bronze rank in his first year. It’s too shocking and he’s so handsome. He doesn’t have a girlfriend, right? I’ve decided, I’m going to chase him.”</p><p>“You? Why would Lu Ming be interested in you?”</p><p>……</p><p>On the field, the female disciples of the four halls were chattering and discussing with great interest.</p><p>Instantly, some of the male disciples were displeased.</p><p>Hmph, although Lu Ming is talented, it’s not his time yet. I don’t think he will pass the first round.</p><p>that’s for sure. It’s impossible for him to pass the first round and enter the top 30. Even if he’s lucky enough to pass, he’ll still be replaced by others.</p><p>The male disciples said unhappily.</p><p>In The White Tiger Hall’s area, there were two people who were staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>One of them was a young lady in a white dress, and her beauty was unparalleled. She was Lu Yao, who had disappeared the moment she joined the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Her father, Lu yunxiong, was sitting beside her.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Yao’s face darkened as she looked at Lu Ming’s tall and straight figure on the fighting ring.</p><p>She had been humiliated during the Lu family’s grand competition and hated Lu Ming to the core. She wanted to take revenge on Lu Ming, so she had been cultivating in seclusion ever since she entered the mystical sword sect.</p><p>This cultivation took almost nine months. Moreover, he was the fiancée of the peerless genius Duanmu Lin, so the Duanmu family was naturally not stingy with their resources.</p><p>With the help of a large amount of resources, Lu Yao’s cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds. She had broken through all the barriers and when she came out a few days ago, she had already reached the sixth grade master realm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
