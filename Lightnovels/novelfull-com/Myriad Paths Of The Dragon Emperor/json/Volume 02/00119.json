It’s best if you can cripple him!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang coldly spoke.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang, are you giving me orders? I’m telling you, I, Ling Kong, am not your Duanmu family’s dog. Don’t talk to me with that tone.”</p><p>Ling Kong grinned, his face filled with arrogance.</p><p>“Ling Kong, you … What did that mean? Lu Ming is The White Tiger Hall’s enemy.”</p><p>Another youth from the Duanmu family said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“He is the enemy of the Duanmu family, not mine.”</p><p>“However, I will give it my all. It’s not because of the Duanmu family, but because Lu Ming is a good opponent!” Ling Kong pouted and continued.</p><p>With that, his figure flashed in the air and he rushed towards the fighting ring.</p><p>this Ling Kong, relying on the grandfather of a gold-robed elder, is simply unruly. He’s a scourge!</p><p>A young man from the Duanmu family said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he’ll have to submit to us sooner or later.”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang sneered.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming and Ling Kong stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, good luck!”</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming is invincible!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples shouted and cheered for Lu Ming.</p><p>Ling Kong, invincible, go Ling Kong!</p><p>senior brother Ling Kong beat Lu Ming up! He will definitely win!</p><p>The disciples of The White Tiger Hall were not to be outdone, and they also shouted.</p><p>After that, the disciples from both sides began to glower at each other. The competition had not even started, but the disciples from both courtyards were already at daggers drawn.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know you’re still hiding your strength. Your blood has never erupted before. Show me all your strength. I won’t show you any mercy.”</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming from above, his eyes filled with wildness.</p><p>“I can’t ask for more!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>Ling Kong laughed.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them moved at the same time. The fighting ring rumbled and the two figures rushed at each other.</p><p>“Demonic wind staff technique-mountain split!”</p><p>“Fire gun art-mountain crash!”</p><p>The iron rod in the air and Lu Ming’s long spear collided heavily.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>As if two ancient demons had collided, an earth-shaking boom was heard. At the point where the spear and the iron rod met, two rays of light, one red and one yellow, exploded violently, forming a huge storm that swept in all directions.</p><p>The surrounding grandstands, even if they were a few hundred meters away, still felt like a strong wind was blowing, and people were almost blown away.</p><p>“This … Wasn’t he too strong? What kind of power was this? Is this still the strength of a master realm?”</p><p>Some of the disciples were horrified.</p><p>It was just a single move, but the power was terrifying.</p><p>In the fighting ring, the two exchanged a blow and both retreated seven or eight steps.</p><p>what a powerful force. Ling Kong’s body is even stronger than mine. It has already reached the second grade upper tier, and his profound level martial skill has also reached the peak of the fourth stage, no weaker than mine. It seems that I can’t win against him with only sixty percent of my strength.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>The strength of Lu Ming’s essential Qi far exceeded that of an average peak ninth grade master. In the previous confrontation, he had only used sixty percent of it at most.</p><p>“Alright, again!”</p><p>It roared in the air and its muscles squirmed. Like pieces of iron, it rushed toward Lu Ming at high speed.</p><p>“Then 70%!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He stepped on the ground with the tip of his foot and his body dashed out like a gust of wind.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was another violent explosion.</p><p>This time, he retreated in the air, but Lu Ming only swayed a little.</p><p>Lu Ming has the upper hand. Is he going to win? ”</p><p>“It’s not that easy, just wait and see!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After retreating in the air, he charged at Lu Ming like a wild beast that had gone mad.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them continued to exchange blows. Ling Kong was forced back each time, but he would charge forward again in the next moment.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Everyone present held their breath and watched without blinking.</p><p>Some of the younger ones were even more excited.</p><p>It was too exciting and violent. The two of them directly met force with force. It was simple and violent, but it was the most shocking.</p><p>In the area of the four courtyards, there were some people who had extremely grave expressions.</p><p>For example, Su Song who was ranked eighth, Dong CE who was ranked ninth, and Lei Dong who was ranked tenth.</p><p>This was because the strength that the two of them had displayed was already close to their own.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With another move, he was forced to retreat seven or eight steps. This time, he did not continue to attack.</p><p>“Haha, awesome, awesome, this is too awesome. Lu Ming, you’re not like those sissies who wield an embroidered sword and learn some slimy body techniques. You’re not like a man at all. I must treat you to a drink after this competition.”</p><p>Ling Kong laughed.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be waiting for your wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his eyes burning with fighting spirit.</p><p>Such a direct collision also made Lu Ming’s blood boil.</p><p>“However, Lu Ming, if this is all you have, I’ll be the winner of this round.”</p><p>Ling Kong said as he licked his lips.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Soon after, Ling Kong’s body flashed with a blood-red light as his bloodline exploded.</p><p>His bloodline was a sixth level bloodline.</p><p>In the mystical sword sect, most of the top geniuses had a fifth-grade bloodline.</p><p>Only an extremely small number of people had bloodlines of the sixth rank.</p><p>It was as fierce as the wind, as high as the sky.</p><p>There was not a single person with a rank 6 bloodline in this batch of newcomers.</p><p>Before Lu Ming rose to power, many people said that this year’s batch was the weakest in recent years.</p><p>Of course, everyone who said that now kept their mouths shut.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>At the same time as Ling Kong’s blood vessels burst out, his body actually let out a sound like beans being fried. Soon after, Ling Kong’s muscles wriggled, his bones shifted, and he actually began to swell.</p><p>In just a few breaths ‘time, Ling Kong’s body had grown several times in size. He was like a giant ape, and a violent and fiendish aura emanated from him.</p><p>“Mad beast technique, secret technique, mad beast technique, Ling Kong actually mastered the Mad beast technique!”</p><p>“With Ling Kong’s strength and the Mad beast technique, how terrifying would he be?”</p><p>“This is the strength of the top five!”</p><p>A series of exclamations came from the stands.</p><p>“It’s actually the Mad beast technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This was something that Hua Chi had not recorded.</p><p>The Mad beast technique was a secret technique that allowed one to transform into a beast and increase one’s strength by a large margin.</p><p>However, its weakness was that it didn’t last long and placed a huge burden on the body. After using it, the body would be weak for a period of time.</p><p>“Receive my attack!”</p><p>He roared in the air and charged at Lu Ming like a giant ape. His speed was much faster than before.</p><p>The eruption of his bloodline and the Mad beast technique had more than doubled Ling Kong’s combat strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The thick iron rod smashed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The metal cudgel smashed through the air, producing a rumbling sound. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“In that case, I’ll use 100% of my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and the essential Qi in his body suddenly burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body exploded with a terrifying aura. Streams of extremely powerful essential Qi wrapped around him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Zhang Muyun, Duanmu Yunyang, bu xingkai, and Duan gang all stood up from their seats.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
