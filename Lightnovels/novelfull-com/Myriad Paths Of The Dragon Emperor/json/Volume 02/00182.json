Lu Ming’s aura was demonic, and the more he fought, the braver and stronger he became.</p><p>The more he fought, the more he was able to use the power of the beast soul.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As he pulled out his spear, one of The White Tiger Hall’s chief elders was sent flying while coughing up blood.</p><p>“Those who block me shall die!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and shot out several spear rays. The spear rays were shocking and seemed to be able to pierce through space.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>The remaining three were sent flying back, spitting out blood.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, it’s your turn,”</p><p>Lu Ming strode out and charged at Lu yunxiong.</p><p>His target had been Lu yunxiong from the beginning.</p><p>“Don’t! Save me!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s expression changed drastically. He ran back frantically while screaming.</p><p>“Stop him. Lu yunxiong is young master Lin’s father-in-law. We can’t let him die!”</p><p>Duanmu Chao and the other three roared and pounced on Lu Ming. The violent attacks enveloped Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>If Lu Ming killed Lu yunxiong, he would be killed as well.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed fiercely and he roared, ” “Then I’ll kill you guys first!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and thrust his spear behind him.</p><p>The spear was as fast as lightning.</p><p>Everyone could only see a flash of light in the sky.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, accompanied by a roar of anger and despair.</p><p>The spear had pierced through Duanmu Chao’s abdomen.</p><p>Duanmu Chao’s abdomen was not a vital part, so he was still alive.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me. If you kill me, you’ll die too.”</p><p>Duanmu Chao cried out in shock.</p><p>“Even now, you’re still saying such things. How laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He shook his long spear and a powerful essential Qi burst out. Duanmu Chao let out a shrill scream. Then, his body was torn into pieces. Blood, internal organs, and bones were scattered on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the spear light exploded and clashed with the other three chief elders.</p><p>Amidst the violent explosion, Lu Ming and the three chief elders retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the direction in which Lu Ming retreated was the direction that Lu yunxiong was running in.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong saw that Duanmu Chao had been torn into pieces by the spear and Lu Ming was charging at him. He was even more frightened and screamed repeatedly.</p><p>“Evil creature! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar came from the sky. It was an old man in a silver robe. His killing intent was extremely sharp as he flew over from the distance.</p><p>“A silver-robed elder! The silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family is here! Haha! Lu Ming is dead meat!”</p><p>Lu Ming is an animal. He fused a powerful beast soul into his body just now. Otherwise, there’s no way he could have such powerful combat strength. However, no matter how strong he is, he’ll be killed by a single slap from the silver-robed elder!</p><p>The White Tiger Hall disciple shouted.</p><p>The silver-robed elder was a position that only martial arts grandmasters could take up.</p><p>A martial arts Grandmaster was also known as a Grandmaster. A martial arts Grandmaster could already establish a sect and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Before he even reached Lu Ming, a terrifying pressure was already pressing down on him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the silver-robed elder struck out a palm across the air. A powerful and terrifying palm print was blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The wind whistled and the palm print was shocking. The pressure was as strong as a mountain, and Lu Ming could not move at all.</p><p>“Is this a martial arts Grandmaster? It’s much stronger than a ninth grade great master realm! Block it, I’m going to block it! Ancient shield!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. The power of the beast soul in his body circulated wildly. An ancient shield condensed and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The shield condensed by the power of beast souls was more solid and ancient than before.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s long spear stabbed out madly. In an instant, hundreds of powerful spearlights were shot forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The silver-robed elder’s palm finally arrived.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s spear radiance was shattered into pieces and exploded in the air like fireworks.</p><p>The hundreds of spearlights were swept away and the palm print continued to move forward. Lu Ming used the high-altitude step and retreated quickly.</p><p>However, he was still hit by the palm print.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The ancient shield let out a melodious vibration sound. The shield shook violently, and the next moment, it exploded.</p><p>However, it was an earth level martial skill after all, and it was operated by the power of the beast soul, which was much stronger than the shield condensed by his own Zhen Qi. Although it was broken, it still offset most of the palm Power.</p><p>However, the remaining force of the palm was still very strong. Lu Ming blocked it with his spear. With a loud bang, his body was pushed back hundreds of meters and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>A long ravine appeared under his feet.</p><p>However, he still managed to block it.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Gasps could be heard from the audience.</p><p>Lu Ming had managed to block a palm strike from a silver-robed elder and was not dead. How was this possible?</p><p>This was a Grandmaster, a ninth grade great Martial Master. Even if there were a hundred of them, they would not be a match for a first grade martial Grandmaster.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had blocked it.</p><p>It was unbelievable!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the silver-robed elder jumped down from the sky and stomped heavily on the ground. The ground exploded with a loud bang, and a huge pit appeared.</p><p>He was an old man in his sixties with white hair and a beard. At this moment, his eyes were full of killing intent and a faint surprise.</p><p>He took a closer look at Lu Ming and sneered. it turns out that he has integrated a powerful beast soul into it. No wonder he has such combat power and can block my palm!</p><p>get out of my way. I want Lu yunxiong. I must kill him today.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The surrounding people were shocked again. What did he mean by audacious? this was how he dared to say such words to a Grandmaster.</p><p>“Foolish!”</p><p>Someone coldly rebuked.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The Duanmu family’s Silver-robed elder laughed out loud before berating, ” “Now, why don’t you kneel down, destroy your cultivation, and wait for your punishment!”</p><p>The silver-robed elder stood between Lu Ming and Lu yunxiong. His aura was as imposing as a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming was under great pressure.</p><p>“It seems like I have to use my last move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with madness.</p><p>If he wanted to be crazy, he would be crazy to the end.</p><p>He decided to merge with the half of the Demon King’s soul.</p><p>However, the energy contained in the soul of a Demon King was absolutely terrifying. With his current cultivation, he would probably explode.</p><p>Even if he had the soul-devouring bloodline, which had already advanced to rank 6, he was not confident.</p><p>However, there was no turning back now.</p><p>Even if he retreated, the Duanmu family would not let him off. Only by fighting could he carve out a path for himself.</p><p>“It seems like you’re not willing? If you’re so stubborn, then let me deal with you, you rebellious little bastard.”</p><p>The silver-robed elder bellowed and sent another palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this palm was stronger and more terrifying than the previous one.</p><p>It was obvious that he had not used his full strength in the previous palm.</p><p>come on then. Let me see how strong a martial arts Grandmaster is.</p><p>The madness in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger, and there was a strong sense of persistence in his madness.</p><p>“Beast soul, fuse!”</p><p>OWW!</p><p>A giant Silver Wolf appeared and howled at the sky. Like the king of ten thousand demons, a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>“Demon King, the soul of the Demon King!”</p><p>The silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family roared madly.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
