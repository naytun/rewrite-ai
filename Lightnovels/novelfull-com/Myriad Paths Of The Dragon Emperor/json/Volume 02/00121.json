You must enter the top three this time, or else my Onyx tortoise Hall will be at the bottom.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Dean. Duan gang will definitely do his best.”</p><p>Zhang Muyun and Zhuo yirong stood side by side in a courtyard of the Azure Dragon Hall.</p><p>“Big brother mu Yun, this time, Duanmu Yunyang will definitely want to obtain the first place. Are you confident?”</p><p>Zhuo yirong asked.</p><p>“In another year, Lu Ming can be my opponent. No one else.”</p><p>Zhang Muyun let out a long sigh. His sigh seemed a little lonely, but it also showed his strong self-confidence.</p><p>This night was destined to be a sleepless one.</p><p>Countless people were looking forward to tomorrow’s battle.</p><p>At first, everyone thought that there were two main points to watch in this competition.</p><p>The first was to see which rank he could get in the air.</p><p>Second, who would emerge as the champion in the battle between Duanmu Yunyang and Zhang Muyun?</p><p>After all, Duanmu Yunyang was the newcomer King of that generation. However, he was suppressed by another person. He wanted to defeat Zhang Muyun at all times.</p><p>But now, there was one more thing to watch.</p><p>How high would Lu Ming, the newcomer King, rank this year?</p><p>Therefore, it was even more exciting.</p><p>Under everyone’s anticipation, the night passed. The sky had just turned bright when Feng Wu and Mu Lan arrived at Lu Ming’s dormitory.</p><p>After that, everyone had their breakfast and walked towards the competition ground together.</p><p>When they arrived, they were shocked. There was already a sea of people here, and the number of people was much more than yesterday.</p><p>The silver disciples who did not come yesterday put down their work and rushed over. In addition, some silver-robed elders had also arrived.</p><p>The ten people today were all true geniuses. They weren’t the kind of old disciples who were stuck at the peak of the ninth grade master realm and couldn’t break through. They were all young and were just suppressing their own cultivation.</p><p>As long as they broke through to the great Martial Master realm, they would be considered geniuses among the great martial masters. They could even fight above their level. In the future, they might be able to enter the silver ranking. Therefore, silver disciples also attached great importance to them.</p><p>Not long after, the deans of the four schools and the sect Masters all arrived.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>With the nine melodious bell chimes, the exciting battle between the top ten had just begun.</p><p>alright, the battles of the top ten will begin now. This battle will be divided into nine rounds.</p><p>“The first match of the first round, Ling Kong versus Duanmu Chen.”</p><p>On the fighting ring, a silver-robed elder announced the verdict.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were suddenly lifted. They didn’t expect that the first round would be such a big show.</p><p>Duanmu Chen, who was ranked fifth on the bronze ranking list, was going to be the winner.</p><p>On the platform, the two of them stood facing each other.</p><p>Duanmu Chen was a rare genius of the Duanmu family. His sword technique was unparalleled, second only to Zhang Muyun on the bronze ranking.</p><p>“Duanmu Chen, you’re no match for me!”</p><p>Ling Kong was still confident, wild, and filled with fiendish Qi.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Duanmu Chen said coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time.</p><p>Duanmu Chen’s sword Qi was incomparably sharp. It tore through the air and the sword broke through the firmament. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Unfortunately, he encountered Ling Kong.</p><p>Ling Kong didn’t care what kind of sword Qi it was. He smashed it with his iron rod. When Ling Kong unleashed his mad beast technique, Duanmu Chen was completely outmatched and was completely suppressed by Ling Kong’s violent attacks.</p><p>This round, Ling Kong won.</p><p>“Ling Kong won, and Duanmu Chen is no match for him. Lu Ming, who’s even more powerful, is definitely stronger than Duanmu Chen.”</p><p>“Indeed, Lu Ming and Ling Kong are both capable of making it to the top five.”</p><p>The victory in the air inevitably reminded people of Lu Ming.</p><p>“The second match, Zhang Muyun versus Dong CE!”</p><p>The judge announced the start of the second round.</p><p>There was no suspense in this match. Dong CE had admitted defeat directly before he even made a move.</p><p>It was unwise to attack when he knew he was no match for them.</p><p>There was more than one battle today. There were still many more to come. If he used up too much energy, it would be disadvantageous for the later battles. He might as well admit defeat.</p><p>the third round, Lu Ming versus Cheng Fei!</p><p>“It’s actually Cheng Feicheng?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The Vermillion Bird Hall only had the two of them in the top ten. He did not expect them to face each other in the first round.</p><p>The two of them ascended the fighting ring from the same area.</p><p>Cheng feichen, around 17 or 18 years old, was dressed in a red dress and looked extremely beautiful.</p><p>There were only two women in the top ten.</p><p>Cheng Feicheng and Zhuo yirong were both famous beauties in the mystical sword sect, and were known as the sect’s top ten beauties.</p><p>At this moment, Cheng Feiyan’s beautiful eyes were bright. She looked at Lu Ming. Junior Brother Lu Ming, I didn’t expect that we would meet in the first round. This is such a coincidence.</p><p>“What a coincidence. Senior Sister, please enlighten me,” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“It’s fine if you want to teach me, but how can I be your opponent? I admit defeat for this round.”</p><p>Cheng Feicheng’s beautiful eyes flickered as he smiled.</p><p>“Ah? Admit defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>“That’s right, Junior Brother Lu Ming. You’re the hope of the Vermillion Bird Hall. We’re counting on you this time!”</p><p>Cheng Feicheng’s eyes narrowed as he smiled and walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s first round ended easily.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards were not too surprised. After all, Cheng Feiyan and Lu Ming were both disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall. There was no reason for them to compete with each other and waste their combat strength.</p><p>“The fourth match, Duanmu Yunyang versus Zhuo yirong!”</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang and Zhuo yirong also had no suspense.</p><p>Zhuo yirong had only made a few symbolic moves, and seeing that she was no match for him, she simply admitted defeat.</p><p>Then came the fifth match, which was also the match that everyone paid more attention to in the first round.</p><p>“Bu xingkai versus Duan gang!”</p><p>Bu xingkai, ranked third on the bronze list, was known as the No. 1 spear user. His attack power was extremely strong.</p><p>As for Duan gang, he ranked fourth on the bronze ranking list and was known as the number one defensive master. His defensive ability was unparalleled among the bronze disciples. On the other hand, his close-combat ability was also very strong.</p><p>This was a battle between the strong.</p><p>“Duan gang, let me pierce through your turtle shell today!”</p><p>Bu xingkai held a black spear and pointed it at Duan gang. It was sharp and overbearing.</p><p>“If you have the ability, try it!”</p><p>Duan gang’s figure was burly and strong. His muscles were bulging, and one could tell at a glance that he was a body-tempering expert.</p><p>“Kill! Formation-breaking spear art!”</p><p>Bu xingkai rushed toward Duan gang and thrust his long spear. The sky was filled with spear shadows, and he attacked Duan gang.</p><p>“Black turtle protection.”</p><p>Duan gang let out a soft cry, and his body began to glow. Five shields that looked like turtle shells condensed around his body.</p><p>At the same time, he put on his spirit weapon gloves and clawed at bu xingkai. His sharp claw radiance was like a blade.</p><p>As soon as they exchanged blows, the two of them began an intense battle.</p><p>Bu xingkai’s attacks were like a storm, continuous.</p><p>However, Duan gang’s defense was impenetrable. Every time bu xingkai’s spear radiance stabbed at Duan gang, it was blocked by the turtle-Shell Shield around his body.</p><p>For a moment, it was difficult to determine who was better.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards were all watching intently.</p><p>that’s amazing! So, that’s the power of the top four on the bronze list? ”</p><p>Pang Shi was dumbfounded as he muttered to himself.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, who do you think will win?”</p><p>Pang Shi suddenly asked.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
