He sneered and said, ” you lost to Zhang Muyun, and your martial heart almost collapsed. I wonder what will happen after you lose to me? ”</p><p>“Lost to you? How could I, Duanmu Yunyang, lose to a newbie? this is the funniest joke in the world. Lu Ming, don’t think that you can disturb my state of mind by using this method. What a joke!”</p><p>“Your path ends here.”</p><p>“Destruction blade art, spirit destruction!”</p><p>Amidst his laughter, Duanmu Yunyang unsheathed his saber. An overbearing saber radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The moment he slashed out, he had already activated his bloodline.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique to the extreme. A majestic dragon-shaped vital energy surged in his strong body and poured into the long spear. Along the long spear, a powerful spinning cutting force erupted.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>The long spear accurately pierced the edge of the blade. A loud boom rang out. Duanmu Yunyang’s body did not move an inch, but Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly and he took a step back.</p><p>“He blocked it. Senior brother Lu Ming blocked Duanmu Yunyang’s attack.”</p><p>Pang Shi cried out in excitement.</p><p>Beside them, Mu Lan, Feng Wu, Hua Chi, and the other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, including the Vermillion Bird Hall’s Dean, were all overjoyed as they stared unblinkingly at the arena.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, he was only at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>At this point, it would be a lie if they did not want Lu Ming to win.</p><p>Although he knew that the possibility was low, he still had a glimmer of hope that Lu Ming could create a miracle.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had blocked Duanmu Yunyang’s attack, he was overjoyed.</p><p>“This Duanmu Yunyang is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his palm was a little numb and he pondered in his heart.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s physical body had already achieved complete second-grade, two levels higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Furthermore, the black grade low level martial arts technique had already been cultivated to the sixth stage, the realm of man and martial arts as one.</p><p>Furthermore, he had a level six bloodline.</p><p>When combined, the explosive power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body and martial arts techniques were at a disadvantage. The only thing he could rely on was the true war Dragon technique’s rich and condensed essential Qi.</p><p>But it was still not enough.</p><p>“You’re quite capable to be able to block an attack with 80% of my power. However, that’s all. Kill!”</p><p>When Duanmu Yunyang saw that he had only gained a slight upper hand in this attack, the killing intent in his eyes became even more intense. He burst out with all his strength and circulated his true Qi to the extreme. His aura instantly became a bit stronger.</p><p>A ray of Saber Light, which was stronger than the previous one, slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to block it!”</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and the others clenched their fists tightly. Their palms were covered in cold sweat as they stared at the battlefield.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and clashed with the saber again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming kept retreating seven to eight steps, his blood and Qi in his body churning.</p><p>“Lu Ming is no match for them!”</p><p>“From the looks of it, Lu Ming will definitely lose within ten moves!”</p><p>“It seems that Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian has not erupted yet!”</p><p>“Indeed. It’s strange. However, under such circumstances, even if he were to activate his bloodline, he would still not be able to escape defeat. Don’t forget that Duanmu Yunyang still has a secret technique that he has yet to use.”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Seeing this situation, sighs could be heard from all around.</p><p>“Should I use Qishi?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. Then, he rejected the idea.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to defeat Duanmu Yunyang if he were to use the ‘force of fire’.</p><p>But this was not the result he wanted.</p><p>He had an idea, a crazy idea. He wanted to make use of Duanmu Yunyang’s pressure to break through his cultivation.</p><p>Otherwise, with his current cultivation base, even if he could defeat Duanmu Yunyang, it would be difficult to defeat Zhang Muyun, who had also comprehended the control force.</p><p>Only with great pressure could he break through his limits and break through his cultivation. Only then could he fight Zhang Muyun.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to take my third saber, world annihilation!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang roared as eighteen blade lights were released from his battle blade.</p><p>Each of the 18 blade lights was ever-changing and unpredictable. Each of them was extremely powerful, as if they could kill everything.</p><p>It was known as the world-destroying one. Although it was an exaggeration, one could still see its power.</p><p>“It seems like I can only activate my bloodline.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he activated his Blood Meridian without hesitation.</p><p>There was a flash of blood-red light and Lu Ming’s aura grew.</p><p>A surge of devouring power covered his entire body. Lu Ming’s strength increased by 40% and he charged directly at the saber ray.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was drowned by the eighteen sword gleams. On the fighting ring, there were only pale sword gleams and fiery red spear gleams, as well as a series of booming sounds.</p><p>“Can Lu Ming block it?”</p><p>At the scene, everyone’s eyes were fixed on the fighting ring for fear of missing out on the important scene.</p><p>After eighteen consecutive explosions, a figure rushed out. His long spear turned into a half-moon and swept toward Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>It was Lu Ming. He was not injured at all.</p><p>Although Duanmu Yunyang’s blade radiance was powerful, half of the attack had been devoured by Lu Ming’s spirit-devouring bloodline. The remaining attacks could no longer harm Lu Ming.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s expression changed when he saw that Lu Ming was not injured and was even charging at him with an attack that was stronger than before.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>In a hurry, he slashed out with his saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s body trembled and he couldn’t help but slide back more than ten meters.</p><p>Unfortunately, the aura on Lu Ming’s body had weakened greatly.</p><p>The burst of his bloodline could only last for five breaths, which was too short.</p><p>“Lu Ming, damn it, go to hell! Blood exterminating slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang flew into a rage after being forced back by Lu Ming’s spear. He slashed his arm with his saber and a stream of blood spurted out. It formed a blood-red saber in the air and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he retreated quickly. However, the blood-red saber seemed to have a mind of its own as it chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>The spear struck the blood-red saber. The saber was crushed by the spear and turned into a blood mist. Then, it condensed into blood leopards that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was enveloped by the blood leopards.</p><p>“Lu Ming, enjoy it. It’s not bad that you can force me to use this move, but that’s all there is to it. Haha!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang laughed wildly.</p><p>“Stop! Stop! Duanmu Yunyang, you’ve won this battle. Stop your secret technique!”</p><p>Mu Lan cried out with an unsightly expression.</p><p>“Stop? Mu Lan, Lu Ming didn’t admit defeat himself. The battle is still in progress. How can he stop?”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang sneered.</p><p>Mu Lan’s expression was ugly. Lu Ming, ” she called out, ” the battle ends here. Admit defeat!</p><p>However, Lu Ming turned a deaf ear to it and focused all his energy on fighting the blood leopards that were pouncing at him from all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s energy, Qi, and spirit were highly concentrated. He circulated the true war Dragon technique to the extreme and fought the blood leopards that pounced at him from all directions.</p><p>The long spear swept out, and the blood leopards were destroyed. However, they immediately condensed again and continued to attack endlessly.</p><p>Lu Ming fought with all his might and raised his potential to the maximum.</p><p>“Ninth grade master realm, break!”</p><p>His potential was stimulated in the great battle. Lu Ming fought as he broke through.</p><p>After countless attacks, the barrier to the ninth grade master realm finally loosened.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, there was a loud boom as the barrier was broken. The spiritual energy between heaven and earth gathered toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be breathing. The essential Qi in his body was getting stronger and thicker.</p><p>breakthrough! Lu Ming is breaking through!</p><p>A silver-robed elder shouted madly.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
