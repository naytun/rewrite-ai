I still need to develop more.</p><p>Lu Ming was prepared to experiment more.</p><p>Immediately, his figure flickered and he left the place to look for other demonic beasts.</p><p>Not long after, he discovered another use for the bloodline.</p><p>When Lu Ming was devouring the blood essence of a demonic beast, he focused his mind and intentionally allowed the blood Meridian to devour the energy of the blood essence completely. As expected, the spirit-devouring Blood Meridian had completely absorbed the blood essence and did not give Lu Ming any energy.</p><p>On the contrary, Lu Ming wanted to use all the energy in the blood essence to increase his cultivation but he could not do it. Half of it would be absorbed by the spirit-devouring bloodline.</p><p>In other words, he could use a portion of blood essence to increase the grade of his bloodline, but not all of it to increase his cultivation.</p><p>This was even better. In the future, he would use the monster core to improve his cultivation level and the blood essence to improve his bloodline level. This way, the level of his bloodline could be upgraded faster.</p><p>However, there were very few level three demonic beasts in this area. Most of them were level two demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to go deeper.</p><p>A day later, in a Valley, Lu Ming saw a giant ape that was ten meters tall. Its roar was like thunder and its aura was like a mountain. Lu Ming was so frightened that he ran away.</p><p>This giant ape was at least fourth grade third level and above. It was extremely powerful, and Lu Ming was no match for it.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after more than ten miles.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to find a suitable demonic beast. It was either too low level or too high level.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming hunted demonic beasts in the mountains by the sea while cultivating his martial arts techniques.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not stop cultivating the body-tempering technique, the flaming Vajra art. He would take some time to cultivate it every day. However, the path of body-tempering was a cultivation technique that required constant grinding and progress was extremely slow.</p><p>Just like that, a month passed.</p><p>Finally, his midair step had broken through to the second level.</p><p>Within a month, Lu Ming had killed eight first grade third level demonic beasts, and his cultivation had broken through to the late ninth grade master realm.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating the ‘air walk’.</p><p>The elevation of the midair step to the second level was even more mysterious. Lu Ming’s body seemed to be weightless, but he could walk on the branches and jump a distance of fifty meters before landing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a few leaps, Lu Ming had reached a mountain peak that was a few hundred meters high.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed. He heard the sound of fighting.</p><p>It was not a battle between demonic beasts, but a battle between humans and demonic beasts.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming leaped down from the mountain peak. His body was as light as a swallow, and he rushed toward the source of the sound like a big Bird.</p><p>After a thousand meters, the sound gradually became clear.</p><p>The roars of demonic beasts and the shrieks of humans could be clearly heard.</p><p>After turning into a dense forest, the scene in front of them came into view.</p><p>Eight young men and women stood in the forest. They were not very old, the oldest only seventeen or eighteen years old. However, each of them had an imposing appearance and a dense and condensed aura. They were all experts.</p><p>A little further in front, a young man holding a spear was fighting with a demonic beast.</p><p>That demonic beast was already riddled with injuries. It was only a matter of time before it was killed.</p><p>Class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly focused and he was somewhat shocked.</p><p>He could clearly see that the young man was only a peak ninth grade Martial Master. For a peak ninth grade Martial Master to be able to fight a first grade third level demonic beast and completely suppress it, such combat strength would rank him in the top three of the bronze list.</p><p>However, Lu Ming definitely did not know the teenager.</p><p>Who were these youths? How could he have such battle prowess?</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a familiar figure in the crowd.</p><p>It was Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s long dress fluttered in the wind, her black hair reached her waist, her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, her skin was like jade, and her figure was graceful. She was even more beautiful than before.</p><p>Junior Brother Wang has improved a lot recently. He can now kill a class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast on his own.</p><p>A young man laughed.</p><p>as a disciple of the Qilin Hall, it’s a basic requirement for a peak ninth grade master realm to kill a class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast. Don’t compare us to the trash from the four halls.</p><p>A cold and arrogant voice sounded.</p><p>“You’re right, senior brother Jian,”</p><p>The other young men quickly said.</p><p>“Who’s sneaky over there? get out here!”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man turned around and shouted in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>The others all looked over.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It seemed that he had been discovered.</p><p>He immediately stepped out.</p><p>“Where did this piece of sh * t come from? You actually peeked at us while we were cultivating. Do you know that this is a serious crime?”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. A young man in a silver outfit looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>From the voice, it was the cold and arrogant young man from before.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. This person really made him speechless. He had only taken a few glances.</p><p>“Piece of sh * t, are you deaf? Didn’t you hear me talking to you?”</p><p>The cold-looking young man said coldly.</p><p>“Young master, young master, why are you here?”</p><p>Suddenly, a surprised voice was heard. Qiu Yue looked at Lu Ming in surprise, then took a few steps forward and appeared beside him.</p><p>“Qiuyue, long time no see.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Young master, it has been a long time. I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s beautiful eyes were filled with joy and a deep sense of longing.</p><p>On the other side, the other young men were stunned.</p><p>Young master?</p><p>Qiu Yue actually called this young man young master?</p><p>The cold-looking young man’s face was extremely gloomy as he asked, ” “Qiuyue, what did you call him? Young master?”</p><p>that’s right. He’s my young master. Jian wuchen, you’d better be more respectful when you speak.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s voice turned cold and her eyes were filled with disgust.</p><p>“Show respect? Hahaha, kid, are you a disciple of one of the four great academies?”</p><p>Jian wuchen asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, did you hear that? he’s just a piece of trash from the four great academies. How could he be qualified to be your young master? Qiuyue, we are all martial artists with special bloodlines. How noble are we? this lowly piece of trash isn’t even worthy of carrying your shoes. Qiuyue, you should just tell him to get lost!”</p><p>Jian wuchen’s eyes were cold and arrogant. He looked down at Lu Ming with disdain.</p><p>It was like a high and mighty Emperor looking at a beggar.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This guy was too full of himself!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A white light flashed in Qiu Yue’s hand and a scimitar as cold as ice appeared. She pointed it at Jian wuchen and said coldly, ” Jian wuchen, if you insult the young master again, I will fight you.</p><p>The cold killing intent gushed out, and the temperature within a radius of dozens of meters dropped sharply, as if winter had come.</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. It seemed that Qiu Yue’s cultivation had reached an extremely high level after not seeing her for a while.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you actually drew your sword against me for a lowly bastard? Hateful? You should die!”</p><p>Jian wuchen roared. He could not bear it.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shook his head.</p><p>Jian wuchen was stunned for a moment, then he burst out with cold killing intent. He gritted his teeth and said, ” “Little bastard, what did you say?”</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
