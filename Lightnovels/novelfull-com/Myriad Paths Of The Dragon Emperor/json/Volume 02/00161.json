As expected, the stone platform had dimmed and returned to its original state.</p><p>it seems like it really needs spiritual crystals to operate.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered the problem and felt at ease.</p><p>However, now was not the time to continue cultivating. He was still in the small plane.</p><p>This was a small dimension left behind by the ancestors of the Dongyi tribe. It might contain great opportunities and Lu Ming did not want to miss it.</p><p>“I’ll study it in the future.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, with a thought, he left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>in this place, other than that Hall, there are still other places that I haven’t explored. I’ll continue to explore before going to other places!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and began to explore the dilapidated Hall.</p><p>Most of the palace was in ruins and had collapsed. Only a few places looked fine.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming had searched more than ten rooms, side halls, and main halls but found nothing. It was empty.</p><p>it seems like there’s nothing left in this place. There’s also the backyard. If I don’t find anything, I’ll leave.</p><p>Lu Ming ran towards the backyard.</p><p>The backyard was very wide, but it was desolate and overgrown with weeds.</p><p>Lu Ming looked disappointed. He shook his head and was about to leave.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. There was a very special place in the middle of the backyard.</p><p>That area was ten meters in radius, and not a single blade of grass grew there. It was completely bare.</p><p>And in the middle, there was a rusty iron rod stuck there.</p><p>The other places were overgrown with weeds, but this area was bare. It was too special. Lu Ming was very curious. He walked over and took a closer look.</p><p>The ground turned out to be a kind of grayish-brown rock that was very hard. Lu Ming stepped on it and it did not move at all. There were no signs of it breaking.</p><p>No wonder not even a blade of grass grew.</p><p>As for the iron rod, it was covered in rust. No one knew how long it had been through the wind and rain.</p><p>“This isn’t an iron rod, it’s a spear!”</p><p>After taking a closer look, Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>It turned out that it was a long spear. However, the spearhead was inserted into the ground, causing Lu Ming to mistakenly think that it was an iron rod.</p><p>this spear must be extraordinary since it’s stuck here. I can’t miss this!</p><p>There was a flash of fire in Lu Ming’s eyes. He held the spear with both hands and pulled it out.</p><p>The spear swayed slightly, but it was not pulled out.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Although he did not use his full strength just now, the strength he used to pull the spear out was enough to lift a huge rock weighing 100000 catties. However, he could not even pull out a spear that was stuck in the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The more this was the case, the more it showed that the spear was extraordinary.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming held the long spear with both hands and stood in a horse stance. He exhaled and said, ” “Rise!”</p><p>With a loud shout, Lu Ming exerted all his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His essential Qi was boiling and the ground rumbled. The muscles all over Lu Ming’s body bulged, and his strength was unrivaled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a clang, Lu Ming finally pulled out the long spear that was stuck in the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, a beast’s roar suddenly sounded from the spot where the spear was pulled out. Then, a black shadow condensed from the ground. It was a huge black Lizard.</p><p>However, it wasn’t a physical body, but an illusionary body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The huge lizard roared and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is a demonic beast’s soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>However, the Black Lizard suddenly exploded and turned into wisps of black gas before it disappeared.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming exhaled.</p><p>It seemed that it was only the remnant soul of a demonic beast. After being suppressed for an unknown amount of time, it was extremely weak and had automatically dissipated.</p><p>The scene returned to normal.</p><p>Lu Ming relaxed and immediately sized up the long spear in his hands.</p><p>The spear was eight feet long and the tip was eight inches long. However, it was rusty and one could hardly tell what it looked like.</p><p>However, the weight of the spear was shocking. Lu Ming estimated that it was at least ten thousand catties.</p><p>“This weight is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and casually waved it a few times. The long spear swept through the air and let out a loud buzzing sound. It was as if muffled Thunder had sounded in the nine Heavens. The momentum was shocking.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was very satisfied with the Spear’s flexibility and elasticity. It was much better than the fiery Tung spear.</p><p>Although he could not tell what level the long spear was, Lu Ming liked it very much based on its weight and flexibility.</p><p>“There are more words!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed two small words on the spear.</p><p>Demon subduing!</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he found that they were the two words ‘demon subduing’.</p><p>“Demon subduing? Demon subduing spear, what a domineering name. Could it be that the lizard’s demonic beast remnant soul was the demonic beast that was suppressed by the demon subduing spear?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>After that, he waved it a few more times and felt that it was very suitable.</p><p>The only bad thing about it was that the spear was covered in rust. It was extremely ugly, like a worn-out piece.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to look for an inscriber to re-forge it after he returned to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>After keeping the demon subduing spear, Lu Ming looked around and did not find anything else. In a flash, he left the place and headed to other places.</p><p>……</p><p>At that moment, there was a majestic mountain peak hundreds of miles away from Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the mountain peak was surrounded by thick fog. The fog was so thick that it was almost impossible to disperse. Even if a martial artist’s vision was far better than ordinary people’s, they could not see their fingers in this fog.</p><p>On the outermost edge of the fog, there were hundreds of stone pillars. In front of the stone pillars, there were dozens of figures.</p><p>They were all Dongyi experts.</p><p>At the very front, there were three figures.</p><p>Two of them were fifth grade great master realm experts from the Dongyi tribe. The other one was a thin figure wrapped in a black robe and a bamboo hat. His face couldn’t be seen clearly.</p><p>However, the two fifth grade great master realm elders seemed to be respectful to the man in the black robe and bamboo hat.</p><p>if I’m not wrong, this mountain is the cave dwelling left behind by your King. Follow my method and carve inscriptions on the stone pillar. Soon, the formation will be broken and the mist will be gone.</p><p>The bamboo hat man ordered in a low and hoarse voice.</p><p>“Yes, if we can get the inheritance of our ancestor, we will never forget your great kindness!”</p><p>A fifth grade great Martial Master elder clasped his fist respectfully.</p><p>Then, the two old men walked up and started to carve inscriptions on the stone pillars.</p><p>Half an hour later, the 100 stone pillars suddenly gave off a dazzling light, and the fog in the surroundings slowly dissipated.</p><p>All the eastern Barbarian people were overjoyed. Their eyes were burning with excitement.</p><p>Not long after, the fog completely dispersed, and the mountain peak that was previously faintly discernible in the fog finally revealed its true appearance.</p><p>This was actually a Wolf-shaped mountain peak. The entire mountain peak was barren. It was as if an incomparably huge rock had been sculpted into a giant wolf.</p><p>The giant wolf lowered its head and opened its mouth, revealing a dark hole.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
