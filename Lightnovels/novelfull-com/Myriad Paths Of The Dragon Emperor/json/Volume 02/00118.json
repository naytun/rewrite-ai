The fire-patterned spear in Lu Ming’s hands seemed to have turned into a fire Dragon.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Then, a shocking scene appeared. The surrounding flames rose and fell with the movement of Lu Ming’s long spear. In the end, they were driven by the long spear and turned into a huge fire Dragon, dancing around Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the sea of fire with fire dragons dancing around him. He was like a god of fire who had descended to the world.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming thrust his spear at the sky. A fire Dragon soared into the sky, spiraling up and soaring into the clouds.</p><p>After reaching a height of a hundred meters, the fire Dragon slowly dissipated and turned into energy, returning to the heaven and earth. On the fighting ring, where Lu Ming stood, there was no longer any flame.</p><p>The flame cage was broken!</p><p>Gu Qing was dumbfounded. He only reacted after a while and forced a smile,”Junior Brother Lu Ming is a genius, I can’t compare to him! Thank you for showing mercy, Junior Brother Lu Ming. I admit defeat.”</p><p>If Lu Ming had aimed his spear at him just now, he would have been seriously injured, if not dead, given the weakened state he was in after casting the secret skill.</p><p>“I was lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“I look forward to Junior Brother Lu Ming entering the top ten!”</p><p>Gu Qing cupped his fists and left the fighting ring.</p><p>He won! Lu Ming had won again!</p><p>The disciples of the four halls were already too weak to exclaim. They could only feel their lips trembling.</p><p>In particular, those who had repeatedly thought that Lu Ming was going to stop and lose felt their faces burning hot as if they had been slapped dozens of times.</p><p>In the area of The White Tiger Hall, Lu Yao and Lu yunxiong’s faces were so dark that they looked like they were about to drip water. In the depths of their eyes, there was even a flash of fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent and speed of improvement had already made them a little frightened.</p><p>“No, he’s still far from Duanmu Lin’s level.”</p><p>Lu Yao clenched her fists tightly as she warned herself over and over again.</p><p>It seemed that this was the only way she could feel better.</p><p>“Lu Ming wins!”</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced on the fighting ring.</p><p>Naturally, the entire arena was in an uproar. Lu Ming smiled, walked down the Coliseum, and returned to his seat.</p><p>“How is it? Senior Sister Mu Lan, I’ve told you that you should believe me. You’re the one who recommended me to come here. If you believe me, it means that you believe in your own judgment.”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Mu Lan triumphantly when they returned to their seats.</p><p>“You … You brat, it’s still early. You can come and show off after you enter the top ten!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s smug look, Mu Lan gritted her teeth in anger. Of course, there was a flash of admiration in the depths of her eyes.</p><p>“Enter the top ten? What’s the reward?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Reward? What kind of reward do you want?”</p><p>Mu Lan smiled.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, I’ll give you whatever reward I want. Will you be satisfied with it?” Lu Ming said with a faint smile.</p><p>Mu Lan pouted her lips and rolled her eyes. She said,”Lu Ming, you can satisfy any condition you want. Sure, unless you can come in first in this competition.”</p><p>“First place? Senior Sister Mu Lan, didn’t you say that?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Mu Lan with a faint smile.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s eyes, Mu Lan’s heart skipped a beat. could it be that Lu Ming can still get first place? ”</p><p>Then, she shook her head.</p><p>First place? It was impossible. The abilities of the top few students were terrifying. She was very clear that it was impossible for Lu Ming to get first place.</p><p>Thinking of this, he felt at ease and smiled, ” “Alright, then it’s a deal.”</p><p>First place?</p><p>The others had similar thoughts as Mu Lan.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, it was very possible for him to enter the top ten. However, it was impossible for him to be in the first place.</p><p>The competition continued, and it didn’t take long for the rest of the competition to end.</p><p>However, the top 15 had not been decided yet.</p><p>Because there was still a challenge.</p><p>This time, the elders would choose the one they thought was the strongest to fill in the sixteenth place.</p><p>After that, they would choose five people to challenge. The winner would enter the top 16.</p><p>Not long after, the spots were selected, and the challenge began.</p><p>This time, no one challenged Lu Ming as he had displayed too powerful an ability.</p><p>It was already evening when all the challenges ended.</p><p>As for the top 16, they had already been announced.</p><p>The White Tiger Hall was still in the lead, occupying seven spots.</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall had four, the Vermillion Bird Hall had three, and the Onyx tortoise Hall had it the worst with only two in the top 16.</p><p>As expected, Gu Qing of the Azure Dragon Hall had fought his way back to the top 16, proving his strength.</p><p>The top ten geniuses all made it into the top sixteen.</p><p>Today’s competition had ended. The next morning, the competition continued.</p><p>This time, it was still decided by drawing lots.</p><p>This time, after the lots were drawn, the silver-robed elder announced the name list for the duel.</p><p>Among them, the most eye-catching one was Lu Ming against Ling Kong.</p><p>That’s right, it was a battle between the two newcomer Kings.</p><p>For example, the other powerhouses who were ranked higher didn’t fight against each other.</p><p>Naturally, the battle between Lu Ming and Ling Kong attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>The entire audience was discussing the battle between Lu Ming and Ling Kong. They were all guessing who would win.</p><p>Lu Ming’s performance was too amazing. They did not dare to say that they would definitely win in the air.</p><p>Under everyone’s anticipation, the match began.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was the first to go up, and his opponent was actually Gu Qing.</p><p>This was a one-sided battle. Gu Qing had used all of his strength to cast the blazing cage, but it had been split apart by Duanmu Yunyang’s blade. Duanmu Yunyang had won with an overwhelming force.</p><p>Then, Zhang Muyun, bu xingkai, Duan gang, and the others also went up one by one. They won without any suspense.</p><p>On the other hand, Cheng feichen had only managed to defeat his opponent after a bitter battle.</p><p>Finally, it was Lu Ming and Ling Kong’s turn in the seventh round.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
