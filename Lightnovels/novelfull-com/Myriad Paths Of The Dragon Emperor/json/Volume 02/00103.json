In addition to the power of the true war Dragon technique, his true Qi cultivation had already surpassed that of a peak ninth grade master.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s physical body had reached lower-tier rank-2, while he tie’s was only at complete rank-1.</p><p>Lu Ming had surpassed he tie in both aspects. Therefore, Lu Ming did not even use his full strength and he could easily suppress he tie.</p><p>“He tie, with your strength, you still have the nerve to call yourself an expert? I’ve said it before, you and Jiang Hao are no different.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out, causing he tie to roar even more furiously. He charged at Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>“I’m done playing with you, it’s almost time to end.”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly and then increased his strength by a few points.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept casting the flame Dragon Fist. His fists were wrapped in a ball of Red Essential Qi. With every punch, a faint Dragon’s Roar could be heard.</p><p>He tie could not block it at all, and his figure kept retreating.</p><p>After a dozen or so punches, he tie felt something sweet in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He tie was going to be defeated!</p><p>Everyone in the audience watched this scene in silence. They knew that he tie’s defeat was already set in stone and there was nothing he could do to reverse the situation.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few more punches, he tie’s body trembled continuously, and blood flowed out of his body.</p><p>At this moment, he really wanted to admit defeat, but when he thought of what he had just said, he forced himself to swallow the words ‘admit defeat’.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and suddenly added another force.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking came from he tie’s arm as he retreated. Lu Ming rushed forward and punched he tie in the stomach.</p><p>He tie let out a blood-curdling screech as his sturdy body was sent flying more than ten meters away. He fell heavily on the fighting ring, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and came to he tie’s side. He looked down at he tie and smiled faintly.”Did you just say that you want to break my bone armor?”</p><p>“I’m not … No, there’s no such thing as Zhang. I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>He tie looked at Lu Ming’s cold gaze and felt a chill in his heart. He was so shocked that he quickly shouted,’I admit defeat’.</p><p>He knew that if he did not admit defeat, Lu Ming would really break his bones.</p><p>“Oh? He admitted defeat? Then get off the stage, you said it yourself, if you break the contract, I don’t mind breaking it too.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He tie’s expression was extremely unsightly. He had indeed said that if he admitted defeat, he would roll down the fighting ring.</p><p>But at that time, he thought that he would definitely win. He had never thought that he would lose, so he said that.</p><p>Now that he had really lost, how could he tell him to get out of the fighting stage in front of so many people?</p><p>However, if he did not do it, Lu Ming could totally use this as an excuse to continue attacking him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t go too far. It’s better to leave some room for others.”</p><p>In the stands, Yao Tianyu stood up and said coldly.</p><p>“Leave a way out? Yao Tianyu, why haven’t I seen you show mercy in the past? Now, your people are lying at my feet like dogs, and I’m standing up and saying that you should leave a way out. What kind of Bullsh * t logic are you talking about?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Yao Tianyu and shouted.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s face instantly turned extremely ugly and gloomy.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, you don’t have to waste your breath. It’s your turn soon.”</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, he turned his gaze away from Yao Tianyu and continued to look at he tie.”Are you going to get lost or not? If you don’t, I’ll personally make you get lost.”</p><p>After saying that, he raised his foot and was about to step on he tie.</p><p>The middle-aged judge didn’t say a word during the process.</p><p>He had to uphold any agreement made on the fighting stage.</p><p>“Wait, wait, I’ll get lost! I’ll get lost!”</p><p>He tie suddenly shouted.</p><p>Compared to having all the bones in his body broken by Lu Ming, he ultimately chose to ‘roll’.</p><p>Immediately, he rolled around on the fighting ring in humiliation. His movements were clumsy and ridiculous. He rolled dozens of times before falling off the fighting ring with a plop.</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded. After a long while, they burst into laughter.</p><p>He tie’s face was completely red, and he was so embarrassed that he could no longer stay there. He ran out of the bronze platform.</p><p>After today, he tie would become a laughingstock.</p><p>On the grandstand, Yao Tianyu’s killing intent was so thick that it could not be dispersed.</p><p>He tie was his man. If he tie lost face, he would lose face as well.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, Lu Ming, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu roared in his heart, his killing intent incomparably sharp.</p><p>At that moment, the judge announced that Lu Ming had won.</p><p>Nine consecutive wins. Lu Ming had already achieved nine consecutive wins and was only one step away from ten consecutive wins.</p><p>Countless people revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>In the history of the mystical sword sect, there were not many people who could enter the bronze ranking in their first year.</p><p>In the past ten years, there was only one.</p><p>He was one of the gold disciples of the mystical sword sect, the strongest among all the disciples, one of the scorching sun’s six heroes, Feng Wuji.</p><p>Feng Wuji was a true peerless genius.</p><p>Could Lu Ming achieve that?</p><p>in the next round, Lu Ming will be fighting against an expert with nine consecutive wins. Who among you with nine consecutive wins will come up for a fight? ”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced.</p><p>For a long time, no one spoke.</p><p>Nine consecutive wins was only one match away from ten consecutive wins. Of course, he had to be extremely cautious. Otherwise, all his previous efforts would be in vain if he lost.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were unfathomable. The disciples who had won nine times in a row would not go up easily if they were not confident.</p><p>After waiting for a while, seeing that no one came forward, the judge said, ” alright, since no one has taken the initiative to come up, I’ll draw lots. Whoever I draw will have to come up.</p><p>This was also one of the rules of the bronze platform, which was to force people to fight. Otherwise, if some people were too strong to fight, they wouldn’t be able to enter the bronze ranking.</p><p>After the judge finished speaking, someone immediately went up the stage and handed him a box.</p><p>Inside the box were the names of all the disciples who had won nine consecutive victories.</p><p>The judge fumbled around randomly. After a while, he took out a bamboo stick with a name on it.</p><p>“Wu Hao, you go up and fight.”</p><p>The judge’s voice echoed throughout the entire arena.</p><p>On the west side of the stands, a young man stood up with a helpless look on his face.</p><p>Since he had been chosen, he could only fight.</p><p>With a few leaps, Wu Hao reached the fighting ring.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, please!”</p><p>Wu Hao cupped his fists, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily suppress he tie and this made him feel very pressured.</p><p>“Please!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>When the judge announced the start of the match, the two of them began to fight.</p><p>For Wu Hao to be able to obtain nine consecutive wins, he naturally had real ability.</p><p>His movement technique and sword technique were both of the upper yellow level, and he had already cultivated them to the sixth level. His talent could not be said to be lacking.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had encountered Lu Ming and was destined to lose.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his full strength. He used the huge sword in his hand to display the lustrous sword technique. He fought with Wu Hao for dozens of moves before he defeated him.</p><p>Ten consecutive wins. After defeating Wu Hao, it meant ten consecutive wins.</p><p>Ten consecutive wins meant that one would be on the bronze list.</p><p>The crowd was boiling.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
