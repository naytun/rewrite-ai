It’s more than ten times stronger than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>He had just entered the cave, but there was already such a rich amount of heaven and earth ling qi. If he cultivated here for a long time, his cultivation speed would definitely be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was impossible, because the speed at which spiritual energy was produced was limited.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to walk in. After a few dozen meters, he saw that there were stone rooms on both sides of the cave. They were probably for people who came in to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to walk in. The spiritual energy in the air was getting thicker.</p><p>After going a hundred meters deep, the heaven and earth ling qi was already more than ten times that of the outside.</p><p>This was the place with the densest spiritual energy in the clam cave. Lu Ming did not continue forward. He walked into a stone room at the side and closed the stone door. He then sat down cross-legged.</p><p>With a flash of Crimson light, the spirit-devouring bloodline emerged.</p><p>After his bloodline advanced to rank 5, his soul-devouring bloodline had grown a little more, and it was no different from a small snake.</p><p>The spirit devouring bloodline appeared. He opened his mouth and inhaled. The surrounding heaven and earth Spirit Qi rolled and gathered towards Lu Ming. It was absorbed by the bloodline and transformed into energy, surging into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and continuously refined the energy that surged into his body into essential Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation continued to condense and was infinitely close to the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to break through. Instead, he continued to Polish his realm and strengthen his Foundation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 20 days had passed.</p><p>“It’s time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and the Qi cyclone in his dantian started to spin rapidly. The essential Qi in his meridians surged like the water of a River. Each stream of essential Qi was like a small true dragon.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming could even hear the roar of a Dragon.</p><p>All of his true Qi gathered together and began to break through the great Martial Master bottleneck.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of explosions sounded like thunder.</p><p>Of course, the outside world could not hear it. All of this was happening inside Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The spirit Qi in the world continued to gather and flow into Lu Ming’s body, replenishing his essential Qi.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming’s body suddenly trembled and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>The strength of this aura was ten times stronger than before.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was like a black hole. The spirit Qi in the world was frantically gathering towards Lu Ming. He absorbed all of it and transformed it into more majestic essential Qi.</p><p>“So strong, is this the martial Grandmaster realm? His true Qi is ten times stronger than that of a peak ninth grade master realm.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He waved his right hand and a fiery-red spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>Condensing Qi into weapons was a technique that only great martial masters could use.</p><p>True Qi condensed into a weapon, and it was as solid as a real spirit weapon. Although it couldn’t be compared to a real spirit weapon, it wasn’t too far off. The key was that as long as one’s true Qi wasn’t exhausted, it could be endless.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the long spear in his hand shot out like lightning. With a swish, it pierced more than half of the wall of the stone room.</p><p>However, the moment the spear left his hand, it instantly turned into energy and disappeared.</p><p>It was said that when one reached the advanced great Martial Master realm, the weapon they condensed would not dissipate, and after a few days, they could even lend it to others for battle, similar to a real weapon.</p><p>After breaking through to the martial Grandmaster realm, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased tremendously. However, he did not leave immediately. Instead, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>He only had a month to cultivate in the Luan Qi cave. He still needed a few days to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>A few days passed in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming got up and walked out of the clam cave, heading to the dormitory.</p><p>When he returned to the dormitory, he saw Hua Chi sitting alone in the courtyard in a daze. He did not know what he was thinking about.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re back. I’ve been waiting for you for a few days.”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes lit up when he saw Lu Ming entering the room.</p><p>“Wait for me? What’s the matter?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ll be leaving the mystical sword sect for a while, so I wanted to bid you farewell.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Leave the mystical sword sect? Where are you going?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Hua Chi sighed as if he had a lot on his mind. After a while, he said,”Something has happened at home, so I have to rush back. I’m afraid I won’t be back at the mystical sword sect for a long time.”</p><p>“You haven’t been back to the mystical sword sect for a long time?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>In truth, Hua Chi had always been a very mysterious person in his eyes.</p><p>Hua Chi had never mentioned his background. Lu Ming and pang Shi did not even know what level Hua Chi’s bloodline was. They only knew that Hua Chi’s talent was astonishing.</p><p>When he had first entered the sect, Hua Chi’s cultivation had been at the first grade master realm. After a year, his cultivation had risen to the sixth grade master realm.</p><p>This was already very shocking for an Ordinary Genius. It was definitely a top-notch talent.</p><p>In addition, they only knew that Hua Chi was very rich.</p><p>Previously, they were all friends and Lu Ming and pang Shi did not probe further. After all, everyone had their own secrets. Now, Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>However, since Hua Chi did not say anything, Lu Ming would not ask.</p><p>“Then we’ll meet again if there’s a chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Lu Ming, big rock accepted the mission to exterminate the Dongyi tribe seven days ago and is heading to dongque city. When you see him, please say goodbye to him for me.” He said.</p><p>Hua Chi continued.</p><p>“Alright, no problem. Wait, destroy the Dongyi? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to nod but he suddenly thought of something and asked in surprise.</p><p>The eastern Barbarian tribe was a tribe that lived in the mountains by the sea. There were millions of them, and they could communicate with demon beasts. They were a major threat to the East of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>The East of the burning sun was under the protection of the mystical sword sect, so the eastern Barbarian tribe couldn’t do anything but hide in the mountains by the sea.</p><p>Did the Dongyi people make a move?</p><p>yes. Hua Chi nodded. a dozen days ago, the Dongyi tribe sent out a 100000-strong Army to attack the region around dongque city. They took down six cities in a row and were finally stopped at dongque city.</p><p>the sect has issued a mission for the disciples of the four courtyards to exterminate the Dongyi race. They will be rewarded with contribution points for killing the Dongyi race and the demonic beasts led by the Dongyi race. Now, many disciples from the four courtyards are heading to East que city.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He roughly knew what was going on.</p><p>The mountain range by the sea stretched on endlessly, covering the entire Eastern Region of the blazing sun Empire. The location of the mystical sword sect was only near the middle of the mountain range by the sea. There was still a long distance between the North and the South.</p><p>East lacking city was located about 20000 miles South of the mystical sword sect, close to the coastal mountains.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely tell big rock.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be going then.”</p><p>After Hua Chi finished speaking, he walked out. After a few steps, he stopped and muttered to himself,”Lu Ming, if there’s a chance, you and big rock can come to the imperial capital to look for me.”</p><p>“The imperial capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Could it be that Hua Chi’s home was in the imperial capital?</p><p>Hua Chi said no more and strode out, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“The imperial capital? I’ll make a trip there sooner or later.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
