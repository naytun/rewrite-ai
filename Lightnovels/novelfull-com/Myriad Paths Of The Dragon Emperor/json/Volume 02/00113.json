Lu Ming’s abilities are probably in the top thirty.</p><p>that’s right. I really didn’t expect him to improve at such a terrifying speed.</p><p>Discussions could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>“Hahaha, senior brother Lu Ming, you’re the best.”</p><p>Pang Shi shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, good luck!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the most handsome!”</p><p>The other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples finally couldn’t help but shout out in excitement.</p><p>With the abilities that Lu Ming had displayed, they could finally cheer for him without worry.</p><p>“This kid is not bad. LAN ‘er, you have good eyes.”</p><p>The head of the Vermillion Bird Hall stroked his beard and revealed a satisfied expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, maybe he can enter that place in the future?”</p><p>Mu Lan sighed.</p><p>The head of the Vermillion Bird Hall’s expression changed slightly. “LAN ‘er, do you really want Lu Ming to go there? Lu Ming is still too far away from it. ”</p><p>I know that Lu Ming is still far from it. But I believe that he will be able to do it in the near future. He has given me too many surprises.</p><p>Mu Lan’s limpid eyes flickered with hope as she looked at the slender figure standing with a spear in the fighting ring.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall principal sighed and did not say anything.</p><p>In the area of The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Damn it, how can this little bastard be so strong?” Lu yunxiong was furious.</p><p>Lu Yao’s face was extremely cold, and her eyes flickered with madness and a sinister light. She glared at Lu Ming on the fighting ring and bellowed in her heart, ” “Lu Ming, Lu Ming, that damned Lu Ming. You’re just a bastard that I abandoned, a piece of trash. How can you be so strong? The trash that I abandoned should be trash, trash for the rest of my life. I will not allow a trash to become stronger than me. I will not allow it. ”</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were shining with all kinds of light as they looked at the figure on the fighting ring.</p><p>Other than the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, his eyes were calm and aloof, as if he was not affected by anything.</p><p>But in the next moment, the sect leader’s indifferent and aloof expression disappeared, and was replaced with shock.</p><p>Because a voice came from the fighting ring.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The entire place quieted down, so much so that even a pin drop could be heard.</p><p>No matter what kind of expression they had on their faces before, they all turned into one expression in an instant-a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming was the one who had said ‘I admit defeat’.</p><p>It was not Yun Feng but Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming admitted defeat?</p><p>What was happening? How did this happen?</p><p>The deans of the four campuses were all dumbfounded. Lu Yao and Lu yunxiong were dumbfounded, and so were pang Shi, Feng Wu, Hua Chi and Mu Lan.</p><p>The other silver-robed elders and gold-robed elders were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ What is Lu Ming trying to do?”</p><p>Pang Shi was tongue-tied.</p><p>Lu Ming has clearly revealed his ability and he can enter the top thirty. Why did he suddenly surrender? what the hell is he doing? ”</p><p>Feng Wu frowned.</p><p>that’s right. His strength can easily enter the top thirty. He’s …</p><p>Hua Chi also frowned and mumbled. He suddenly stopped and his eyes lit up. He smiled and said, I know what Lu Ming is going to play. Haha, I like it.</p><p>“You know? Why is that?”</p><p>Pang Shi asked in surprise.</p><p>“I can’t tell you now, just wait and see.”</p><p>Hua Chi smiled mysteriously.</p><p>Pang Shi, Feng Wu, and the others all looked down on her.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the silver-robed elder’s eyes were wide open. He was stunned for a long time before he asked, ” “Lu Ming, what did you say? You admit defeat?”</p><p>“Yes, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you mean by this? Are you looking down on me?”</p><p>In front, Yun Feng stood up and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m not looking down on you. Don’t misunderstand, I’m just admitting defeat.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Yun Feng was at a loss for words.</p><p>The silver-robed elder confirmed once again before helplessly announcing that Yun Feng had won this round.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked back to the Vermillion Bird hall area.</p><p>f * ck, Lu Ming, What are you playing at? hurry up and tell me. Otherwise, I’m not done with you.</p><p>Feng Wu glared at Lu Ming, gritting her teeth.</p><p>“You’ll know in a while.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>senior brother Lu Ming, why are you saying the same thing as the love-struck fool? I really don’t understand you guys.</p><p>Pang Shi scratched his head.</p><p>Lu Ming and Hua Chi looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>Then, the competition continued.</p><p>In less than an hour, all 30 matches had ended.</p><p>Among them, the four most popular newcomer Kings.</p><p>One of them was Feng xinglie. He had not trained for long enough and met an expert who was ranked 21st. He failed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he admitted defeat.</p><p>The other two were extremely powerful, so they naturally advanced easily.</p><p>The top 30 had already been decided, but it was not over yet. There were still challenges.</p><p>The silver-robed elders from the four courtyards, the silver-robed elders from the sect leader’s side, and the two gold-robed elders discussed and decided to select ten powerful challengers.</p><p>This was because there were indeed some powerful geniuses among them. If they were unlucky, they would encounter those ranked in the top ten or those ranked in the top ten. Naturally, they were no match for them. Now, they had to give them a chance.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the ten challengers to be announced.</p><p>I now announce the candidates for the challenge. They are Wu Jin, Huang Fei, Lu Ming …</p><p>The hosting silver gowned elder announced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name was among them.</p><p>haha, I knew it. Senior brother Lu Ming will definitely have another chance to challenge him. The abilities that he displayed just now are very powerful.</p><p>Pang Shi said with a smile.</p><p>At this moment, the names had been announced. The silver-robed elder said, ” alright, you can choose your target now.</p><p>As soon as the silver-robed elder finished speaking, a figure quickly leaped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The figure was Lu Ming.</p><p>The crowd was stunned again. Lu Ming had just admitted defeat and was the first one to step onto the fighting ring to issue a challenge. What was he trying to do?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He turned around and looked at The White Tiger Hall. He pointed the spear in his hand and said coldly,”Duanmu yunchong, get your ass up here.”</p><p>The cold voice spread throughout the area, causing many people to be shocked. Then, some of them had a look of realization.</p><p>“I know. I know why Lu Ming admitted defeat earlier. His goal was to obtain the right to challenge Duanmu yunchong.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>that’s right. Before Lu Ming admitted defeat, he deliberately displayed his powerful combat strength and defeated Yun Feng in one move. He knew that even if he admitted defeat, he would still be given the right to challenge Yun Feng. He’s trying to take revenge for Vermillion Bird Hall’s Liu Hui.</p><p>“I see, I see!”</p><p>This time, everyone on the field understood.</p><p>On the highest grandstand, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect looked at Lu Ming curiously and muttered,”This Lu Ming is indeed not bad!”</p><p>“It’s not easy to attract the sect leader’s attention.”</p><p>A golden-robed elder smiled and said.</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was in an uproar as they entered into a heated discussion.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
