Look, who’s that?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s the Lu family’s young master, Lu Ming. I heard that he’s already dead, right?”</p><p>“So he didn’t die. Something big is going to happen.”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked into fiery wind city, the crowd around him looked at him and started to discuss.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He felt that the people around him were looking at him strangely. Other than surprise, there was also a trace of pity.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled but he did not stop. He went straight to the Lu family.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at the Lu family’s Gate.</p><p>“Who’s there? Stop right there, huh? You … Young master? Lu Ming!”</p><p>A burly man guarding the door shouted. Then, he saw that it was Lu Ming and let out a surprised cry.</p><p>The other guards were also shocked.</p><p>“It’s me. I’m not dead. Move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was about to walk inside.</p><p>However, a few burly men guarding the door pulled out their sabers and stood in front of Lu Ming. “Lu Ming, you can’t go in.”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and his brows furrowed even more.</p><p>The guards of the Lu family had actually called him by his name and even pulled out their knives to stop him.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was angry, the few burly guards turned pale. Clearly, they were afraid.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re just following orders. No one is allowed to enter!” One of them gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Orders? Whose orders?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated him but the bad premonition in his heart grew stronger.</p><p>“Young master, young master, leave quickly, leave quickly, don’t come back.”</p><p>Suddenly, a white-haired old man rushed out and shouted.</p><p>“Uncle Chong, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>This old man was an old servant of the Lu clan. He did not have much cultivation, but he had always been loyal to the Lu clan.</p><p>young master, it’s the first patriarch. He’s back with many powerful warriors. He wants to take over the Lu family. Several core patriarchs have been killed. The other branches of the Lu family have all turned to the first patriarch. You’d better leave!</p><p>Uncle Chong shouted.</p><p>“What? Lu yunxiong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>“Where’s my mother? How’s my mother?”</p><p>The first person that Lu Ming thought of was Li Ping.</p><p>“Madam has been locked up in the courtyard of the main hall and interrogated by them for two days. This old servant also does not know what the situation is like. Young master, the great elder has brought many experts with him this time. You’re not his match, so you’d better leave first. As long as you’re alive, you’ll have hope.”</p><p>Uncle Chong tried to persuade him, his old face full of worry.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Uncle Chong’s words were like bolts of lightning that exploded in Lu Ming’s heart. In an instant, an indescribable cold killing intent emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Lu-Yun-Xiong!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>At the same time, he was extremely afraid that something had happened to Li Ping.</p><p>The few burly guards and uncle Chong shivered and a chill ran up to their heads.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a cold beam of light shot out from behind the door. It was too sudden. Lu Ming was shocked and wanted to save her but it was too late.</p><p>A sword light pierced through Chong Bo’s back.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as Chong Bo fell to the ground.</p><p>“Young master, run, run!”</p><p>Uncle Chong shouted and gradually lost his breath.</p><p>A young man in his twenties walked out from behind the gate and said coldly, ” old man, you actually dared to disclose information. You’re courting death!</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming with a slightly surprised expression. “Lu Ming, you’re really lucky. You landed in the ruins of the Dongyi tribe and you’re still alive. But you shouldn’t have come back. Since you’re back, I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression was calm, but the killing intent in his eyes was colder than ten-thousand-year-old profound ice.</p><p>This young man had a green wood embroidered on his sleeve. He was obviously a young expert from the Duanmu family.</p><p>“What? You want to kill me? I know that your combat strength is comparable to an ordinary fifth grade great Martial Master, but I’m also a fifth grade great Martial Master. Do you think that I’m just an ordinary fifth grade great Martial Master?”</p><p>The young man from the Duanmu family sneered.</p><p>“Nonsense, die!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming erupted with all his might.</p><p>The powerful genuine Qi, coupled with the power of fire, was like a volcanic eruption.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear swept towards the youth from the Duanmu family.</p><p>The youth from the Duanmu family’s expression changed drastically as he raised his sword to block.</p><p>But-</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear collided with his long sword. It was as if he had been hit by a volcano. His body was like a cannonball, flying backward. He crashed into two walls in a row and was finally embedded in the third wall.</p><p>“What … How is that possible?”</p><p>His eyes were filled with disbelief and fear.</p><p>One move, with just one move, all the bones in his body were broken, and he was embedded in the wall like a pool of mud.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful? He was a genius, and his combat strength was not comparable to an average fifth grade Grandmaster. Yet, he could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in his hand and walked towards the youth from the Duanmu family.</p><p>The few burly men guarding the door were so scared that their souls almost left their bodies and they were trembling all over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t … Don’t kill me! The Duanmu family has a ninth grade Grandmaster here. If you kill me, your entire family will die, and your mother will be in a miserable state!”</p><p>The youth from the Duanmu family cried out in shock.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands turned into a ray of light and shot out, piercing through the young man’s heart and nailing him to the wall.</p><p>Lu Ming leaped over two walls, pulled out his long spear, and headed toward the Lu family’s courtyard.</p><p>The Lu clan’s courtyard was outside the Lu clan’s conference hall. It occupied a large area.</p><p>At this moment, an old man was sitting on an armchair at the entrance of the conference hall, resting with his eyes closed.</p><p>There were more than ten people standing around the old man. One of them was Lu yunxiong, who was staring at the courtyard with a cold expression.</p><p>In the courtyard, Li Ping and the four core elders of the Lu clan stood together. They were surrounded by more than 30 burly men.</p><p>These people were basically from the Duanmu family.</p><p>However, there was an exception, and that was ning Kong.</p><p>Yes, it was Ning Feng’s father, one of the chief elders of the Vermillion Bird, ning Kong.</p><p>Li Ping, have you thought it through? announce to the entire Lu family that you’ll pass the position of the Lu family’s patriarch to me. Then, kneel down in front of everyone and apologize to me. Admit that you’ve let me down.</p><p>Lu yunxiong coldly looked at Li Ping and said.</p><p>“You wish! You’re dreaming!”</p><p>Li Ping rejected him directly.</p><p>“Don’t even think? I’ve starved you for two days, but it seems that it’s not enough. Then continue to starve and stand here. I’ll see how long you can hold on!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong said gloomily.</p><p>Li Ping’s face was pale, and her body was trembling. She looked extremely weak.</p><p>It had been two days. It had already been two days. She had been forced to stand in the courtyard by Lu yunxiong. She had no food, no water, and had to endure the scorching sun.</p><p>Li Ping was only an ordinary person and did not practice martial arts, so she could not protect herself with true Qi. At this time, she was extremely weak and could collapse at any time.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
