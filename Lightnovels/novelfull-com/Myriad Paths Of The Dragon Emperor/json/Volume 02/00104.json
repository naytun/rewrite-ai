This had never happened in the history of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Many people cheered that they had not come in vain.</p><p>They had come today to see if Feng xinglie could make it onto the bronze rank. In the end, Feng xinglie lived up to expectations and successfully made it onto the bronze rank. He even defeated Duanmu Hu, who was ranked 55th.</p><p>Originally, they had thought that it would end like this. However, the truth was that it had not ended.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming had stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>In the beginning, no one was optimistic about Lu Ming’s chances. They thought that Lu Ming had stepped onto the fighting ring on impulse after seeing Feng xinglie’s glory.</p><p>However, it turned out that they were all wrong. Lu Ming had displayed his superb combat abilities and swept through the crowd. He had made it to the bronze rank directly, shocking everyone.</p><p>Many of them had said with certainty that Lu Ming was arrogant, overconfident, and that it was impossible for him to succeed. Now, they had been slapped in the face by the facts. However, they did not care anymore. They were all excitedly releasing the excitement in their hearts.</p><p>WOWO, this is too strong. He managed to enter the bronze ranking in his first year. In the past ten years, only senior brother Feng Wuji has managed to do it.</p><p>“Who is senior brother Feng Wuji? He’s a peerless genius, one of the six heroes of the scorching sun sect. I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be able to do it. Could he be a genius on the same level as senior brother Feng Wuji?”</p><p>“That’s not necessarily true. Some people are powerful in the early stages but may not have such strong potential in the later stages. However, Lu Ming’s current performance is indeed very strong.”</p><p>actually, other than senior brother Feng Wuji, Duanmu Lin from The White Tiger Hall can do it as well. However, his bloodline was awakened too early and he was promoted to a silver disciple. That’s why he didn’t try for the bronze rank.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard of this before.”</p><p>As the newcomer King this year, Lu Ming had won ten consecutive matches. Many disciples had already begun to compare him with the strongest geniuses in the past.</p><p>senior brother Lu Ming is mighty. He’s invincible.</p><p>In the southern grandstand, pang Shi roared excitedly, his face flushed with excitement.</p><p>“Brother, do you know senior brother Lu Ming?”</p><p>Someone nearby asked pang Shi. When he addressed Lu Ming, he had already added the word ‘senior brother’.</p><p>of course. Senior brother Lu Ming and I live in the same courtyard. We’re roommates.</p><p>Pang Shi said proudly.</p><p>“He’s actually senior brother Lu Ming’s roommate? Junior Brother pang, if there’s a chance in the future, please introduce us to senior brother Lu Ming.”</p><p>The other disciples said immediately.</p><p>In the mystical sword sect, many things would be much easier if he had a backer.</p><p>Lu Ming, a disciple who had just joined the sect this year, had displayed shocking talent. Given time, no one knew what level he would reach. Many smart people were already thinking of ways to get closer to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, haha, I can try, but I can’t guarantee that senior Lu Ming won’t have the time.”</p><p>Pang Shi said as he touched his head.</p><p>“That’s for sure.”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>Beside pang Shi, Hua Chi’s eyes were also filled with shock. At the same time, there was also a deep admiration.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze ranking all had different expressions on their faces.</p><p>For example, Yan Xu, who was ranked 50th, and Jidong, who was ranked 48th, both had extremely serious expressions.</p><p>On the other hand, Feng xinglie’s eyes were glistening as he looked at Lu Ming with surprise and admiration, as well as a strong desire to fight.</p><p>As for Yao Tianyu, his face was extremely gloomy, and at the same time, killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>As for the geniuses who were ranked higher on the bronze list, their eyes lit up. No one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>“Do you think Lu Ming will continue to challenge?”</p><p>“I think so. Didn’t you see? He had previously provoked Yao Tianyu by name. I guess he will definitely challenge Yao Tianyu.”</p><p>if he really challenges Yao Tianyu, that would be interesting.</p><p>actually, I think it would be more interesting if he were to challenge Feng xinglie. Both of them would be the new generation King.</p><p>“Yes, yes.”</p><p>Around them, the disciples of the four courtyards began to guess whether Lu Ming would continue to challenge them.</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced, ” Lu Ming, you’ve won ten battles in a row and have made it onto the bronze ranking. According to the rules, you’re now ranked fifty-eight. I’ll report this to the sect.</p><p>“Now, do you still want to continue the challenge?” The middle-aged judge looked at Lu Ming and asked. His eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>He had hosted the bronze platform for many years and had seen all kinds of geniuses. However, people like Lu Ming were extremely rare.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming. They wanted to know who Lu Ming would challenge. Could it be Yao Tianyu?</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Yao Tianyu.</p><p>Yao Tianyu looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Yao Tianyu, three months ago, I said that I wanted to fight you. However, at that time, you were high and mighty, saying that I was not qualified to fight you. Now, do I have the right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yao Tianyu and said word by word.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I admit that you’re quite talented. You’re indeed qualified to challenge me now. But do you think …” Yao Tianyu said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Then why are you still talking nonsense? Come down and fight me!”</p><p>Lu Ming interrupted Yao Tianyu’s words and shouted loudly in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>When Had Yao Tianyu ever ‘enjoyed’ such treatment? he was interrupted by Lu Ming halfway through his sentence and was even told to get lost for a fight. He felt a towering anger suffocating his chest and almost caused internal injuries. He clenched his fists tightly, making cracking sounds.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you dare to fight to the death?”</p><p>Yao Tianyu let out a furious roar.</p><p>“Just what I want, get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was strong and he was not afraid at all.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s figure flickered and he appeared on the fighting ring, standing opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you really want to have a life-and-death battle?”</p><p>The middle-aged judge asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“I’ll kill Lu Ming in a battle of life and death!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu said coldly.</p><p>alright, then let’s have a life-and-death battle. We won’t stop until one of us is dead!</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced.</p><p>In a life-and-death battle, one person would definitely die. No matter who died, it would be a great loss to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>However, the path of martial arts was full of thorns and difficulties. Every peak expert was tempered through life and death. The middle-aged judge and the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect knew this very well, so they would not stop the death duel between the disciples.</p><p>No matter how much of a genius he was, as long as it was a fair fight, they would not stop him.</p><p>If ten geniuses died in battle and a peerless expert was born, it would be worth it.</p><p>As the judge’s voice fell, the atmosphere in the stadium was once again ignited and boiling.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yao Tianyu were going to have a life-and-death battle. This meant that only one of them could leave the fighting ring today.</p><p>Between the two of them, who would win?</p><p>Yao Tianyu himself was a super genius. Two years ago in the newcomer’s trial, he was one of the popular candidates to compete for the newcomer King.</p><p>Now, he was only seventeen years old, but he had already reached this level of cultivation, which was extremely rare.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was a super genius among super geniuses. He was this year’s newcomer King. In his first year, he had already made it to the bronze rank.</p><p>In the clash between the two, who would have the last laugh?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
