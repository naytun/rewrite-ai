It seems that the Dongyi people have all rushed in.”</p><p>this must be an important place left behind by the ancestors of the Dongyi tribe. There must be some great treasures in there. Let’s go in too!</p><p>A few mystical sword sect disciples also rushed in.</p><p>Of course, some of the weaker ones, such as the first and second grade Grandmaster realm, didn’t rush out rashly when they saw the crazily dancing vampiric vines.</p><p>The ones who rushed out were all third grade great martial masters and above, and there were more than a dozen of them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he rushed out as well.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh …</p><p>At once, blood-colored vines shot toward Lu Ming like bolts of blood-colored lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and struck the blood-colored vines away.</p><p>Although these blood-colored vines posed a fatal threat to first and second grade Grandmaster realm martial artists, they posed no threat to him at all. Lu Ming made it through very quickly and ran towards the mouth of the wolf-shaped mountain peak.</p><p>However, he stopped not long after.</p><p>In front of them, demonic beasts roared, and a fiendish aura filled the air.</p><p>There were at least 50 demonic corpses and demonic puppets fighting against the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>These Dongyi people were, of course, experts of the third grade great Martial Master realm and above. They had broken through the blood-snake vines, but they had not expected to be besieged by a large number of demonic corpses and puppets.</p><p>Moreover, these demonic corpses and demonic insects were unusually powerful. Lu Ming even found demonic corpses and demonic insects with combat strength equivalent to a fourth grade great Martial Master among them. There were more than a dozen of them.</p><p>On the ground, several Dongyi Masters had been torn apart. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind them, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Chen Kuan and the others had also rushed through the blood snake vines and were rushing over. However, when they saw the demonic beasts and demonic puppets in front of them, their faces turned green.</p><p>“There are so many demonic corpses and demonic puppets. How do we fight them?”</p><p>Chen Kuan said with an ugly expression.</p><p>In front of them, the Dongyi people had clearly seen Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“You guys can leave first. The two of us will be enough to barge in. Those Little Rascals from the mystical sword sect won’t be able to.”</p><p>A fifth grade great master realm elder from the Dongyi tribe called out.</p><p>Then, the other Dongyi people retreated as they fought, out of the encirclement of the demonic corpses.</p><p>The strange thing was that the demonic corpse didn’t chase after the Dongyi people when they had retreated to a certain distance. It only pounced on the two fifth grade great Martial Master elders as if it wanted to stop them from rushing in.</p><p>However, the two fifth grade great Martial Master realm elders joined forces and slowly made their way in.</p><p>“What do we do? There are so many powerful demonic corpses and demonic puppets. We can’t break in at all.”</p><p>A young man from the Azure Dragon Hall shouted.</p><p>“No matter what, let’s give it a try!”</p><p>The remaining fourth grade great Martial Master realm young man from The White Tiger Hall was unwilling to give up, and he charged forward.</p><p>But in an instant, three or four demonic corpses equivalent to fourth grade great Martial Master realm pounced at him.</p><p>He had to use all his strength to escape and retreat. He was almost seriously injured, and his face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>There were too many demonic corpses and demonic puppets that were equivalent to fourth grade great Martial Master realm, and it was impossible to break through them.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, do you want to try?”</p><p>Chen Kuan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His figure suddenly dashed out and rushed into the demonic corpse and the demonic armor.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Instantly, four fourth grade great Martial Master realm demonic corpses and demonic puppets pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed and he swept his long spear horizontally.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, three or four demonic corpses and puppets were blown away.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Chen Kuan and the other mystical sword sect disciples, including the Dongyi tribe, were all shocked.</p><p>‘He swept away three or four fourth grade great Martial Master realm demonic corpses with a single spear strike. Isn’t he too strong? does he need to have the combat strength of a fifth grade great Martial Master?’</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming already had the combat strength of a fifth grade Grandmaster? This was too unbelievable, right?</p><p>It had only been a few months since the great competition of the four courtyards. Lu Ming’s improvement speed was too terrifying!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and was invincible. He swept away the demonic corpses and demonic puppets one by one and quickly pushed forward.</p><p>At this moment, the two fifth grade great Martial Master realm elders had already broken through the encirclement of the demonic corpses and appeared a hundred meters away. It seemed that the area was the forbidden area of the demonic corpses and demonic insects. Once they arrived there, not a single demonic corpse or demonic insect would chase them.</p><p>They had planned to rush in directly. After all, the thin black-robed man had disappeared without a trace. He might have already rushed into the cave of the Dongyi ancestors.</p><p>However, they saw Lu Ming rushing over at high speed.</p><p>“Damn it, we can’t let him pass. The two of us will stop him here!”</p><p>An old man who was a little cowardly said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Good! They would kill him here and then go in to kill that guy. The things left by the Dongyi ancestors could not fall into the hands of outsiders.”</p><p>A chubby old man nodded, his face filled with killing intent.</p><p>The two of them stood side by side, staring at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and the demonic corpses and demonic puppets were sent flying. He rushed over quickly.</p><p>A few minutes later, he neared the two Eastern Barbarian elders.</p><p>At this moment, the demonic corpses and demonic puppets roared and stopped chasing Lu Ming. They returned to their original places and glared at Chen Kuan and the rest.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At the same time, the two elders from the Dongyi tribe charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not take the attack head-on. Instead, he used the midair step and soared into the sky, avoiding the attacks of the two elders.</p><p>Then, he stomped in the air as if he was walking in the void. He moved forward for dozens of meters and jumped over the two elders.</p><p>“Haha, I’ll take my leave first!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He moved and dashed toward the wolf-shaped mountain peak.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The two elders from the eastern Barbarian tribe bellowed and chased after Lu Ming. In the blink of an eye, they had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Lu Ming actually rushed in.”</p><p>The other mystical sword sect disciples were envious, especially The White Tiger Hall disciples.</p><p>Lu Ming sprinted at high speed, getting closer and closer to the black Mouth of the wolf-shaped mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and rushed in directly.</p><p>The two elders of the Dongyi tribe followed closely behind.</p><p>“We’ll find an opportunity to break them one by one!”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>His cultivation had just broken through to the second grade great Martial Master realm, so he was confident that he could deal with a fifth grade great Martial Master, but he wasn’t sure if he could deal with two at the same time.</p><p>The dark cave was extremely deep. Lu Ming ran for thousands of meters before he reached the end.</p><p>In front of him, a huge stone room appeared.</p><p>In the stone room, there were six stone pillars. Above each stone pillar, there was a secret manual floating. Above the secret manual, there was a layer of light.</p><p>At this moment, two of the secret manuals on the stone pillars had disappeared. On the other stone pillar, a thin figure in a black robe was constantly bombarding the Halo of a secret manual.</p><p>At this moment, the skinny black-robed man seemed to have noticed Lu Ming and his gaze swept over him.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect that someone had already entered in advance.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
