Instead, they stopped a few thousand meters away from dongque city.</p><p>That place was beyond the range of the crossbows.</p><p>On the city wall, the crowd looked at each other, not knowing what the Dongyi tribe was up to.</p><p>At this moment, a young man from the Dongyi tribe rode on a Tiger and charged forward for a hundred meters. He looked at dongque city and shouted, ” “There must be many mystical sword sect disciples among you, right? I’ve heard that the mystical sword sect is one of the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire, with countless experts and geniuses. I’d like to see it for myself today.”</p><p>I, BA he, am nineteen years old. Now, I officially challenge the geniuses of the mystical sword sect who are under the age of twenty. Who wants to fight me? ”</p><p>His voice rolled and spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>On dongque city, tens of thousands of soldiers were stunned.</p><p>Instead of attacking the city, the Dongyi tribe sent a young man to challenge the genius of the mystical sword sect. What was the meaning of this?</p><p>do they want to use this to attack our morale? ”</p><p>Fu Liang frowned and pondered.</p><p>However, he had no choice but to take the Dongyi tribe’s attack.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe was only a small tribe with a population of a few million. Compared to the burning sun Empire, they were many times worse.</p><p>A small clan had sent a young man to challenge a genius from the mystical sword sect, one of the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire. If the eastern Barbarian tribe refused to accept the challenge, they would definitely say that the mystical sword sect was afraid of them.</p><p>This would definitely affect their morale.</p><p>“Young heroes, does anyone of you want to fight?”</p><p>Fu Liang said to the mystical sword sect disciples.</p><p>“You can fight, but be careful of traps!”</p><p>Many of the mystical sword sect disciples hesitated. If they left the city and the other party attacked them, wouldn’t they die an unjust death?</p><p>The Dongyi tribe seemed to have guessed what they were thinking. The Army of demonic beasts retreated slowly. They didn’t stop until they were ten miles away.</p><p>With such a long distance, even if they were to attack, it would be enough for the disciples of the mystical sword sect to escape back to East lacking city.</p><p>“Fellow junior brothers, which one of you will go up to fight?”</p><p>A young man in his twenties from the mystical sword sect asked.</p><p>The other party had clearly stated that he wanted to challenge those below the age of 20, but he had already exceeded his age.</p><p>since the other party dares to fight, they must be quite strong. We can’t be careless.</p><p>Some people were more cautious.</p><p>what kind of genius can the Dongyi tribe have? it’s already impressive that he’s reached the ninth grade master realm at the age of nineteen.</p><p>Some people were disdainful.</p><p>A nineteen-year-old who had reached the ninth grade master realm could be considered a genius even in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Most of the people on the bronze ranking were already eighteen or nineteen years old. Some of the older disciples were even in their twenties.</p><p>“I think it’s better to be cautious. What if the other party is a great Martial Master?”</p><p>Someone cautiously said.</p><p>I’m at the first grade great Martial Master realm at most. I’ll go and fight!</p><p>In The White Tiger Hall, a tall young man shouted coldly. He jumped down from the city wall and strode towards the Dongyi youth BA he.</p><p>it’s Duanmu Yunfei. With him, we will most likely win!</p><p>that’s right. I heard that Duanmu Yunfei almost entered the bronze rank. He is very talented. He is now 20 years old and is already a first level great Martial Master.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect were rather confident in Duanmu Yunfei.</p><p>Duanmu Yunfei’s speed was extremely fast. It did not take long for him to arrive in front of BA he.</p><p>“Come down and fight!” Duanmu Yunfei coldly shouted.</p><p>BA he laughed as he jumped down from the Tiger and stood opposite to Duanmu Yunfei.</p><p>“You go first. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance.”</p><p>Bach was very confident.</p><p>you’re just a barbarian. You’re like a bug. How dare you be so arrogant in front of me? you’re looking for death!</p><p>Duanmu Yunfei’s killing intent flashed. He unsheathed his long sword and instantly stabbed out three times. Three sword lights flashed and disappeared at an astonishing speed.</p><p>An ordinary ninth grade master realm martial artist would not be able to Dodge it and would be killed in an instant.</p><p>The power of the great Martial Master realm was fully displayed in one move.</p><p>However, BA he’s body arched slightly like a fierce tiger. With a step, his body was like lightning and he easily avoided Duanmu Yunfei’s sword light.</p><p>he’s so strong! He’s definitely reached the great Martial Master realm!</p><p>The people who were watching the battle on the city wall were shocked.</p><p>It seemed that although the Dongyi tribe was small in number, they still had geniuses.</p><p>Duanmu Yunfei’s eyes glinted when his attack missed. He immediately activated his bloodline power and used his most powerful combat strength.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Nine consecutive sword strikes, the sword Qi was endless as it headed towards BA he.</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>BA he’s eyes flashed with a fierce light and a thick murderous aura was emitted from his body, like a fierce beast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of white light flashed out, like a bright moonlight.</p><p>That was BA he’s blade light, but it was unbelievably fast. Duanmu Yunfei didn’t even see it clearly before he felt a cold sensation at his throat. Following that, it was an endless darkness.</p><p>“One blade, he killed Duanmu Yunfei with one blade. How is this possible?”</p><p>On the city wall, everyone was extremely shocked as they saw Duanmu Yunfei’s head fly high into the air.</p><p>“I didn’t even see clearly when he drew his blade.”</p><p>“I didn’t see it clearly either. It was too fast. I only saw a flash of light and Duanmu Yunfei was killed.”</p><p>this BA he is too strong. I can’t believe the Dongyi tribe has such a genius.</p><p>The mystical sword sect disciples discussed among themselves.</p><p>in my opinion, the Dongyi tribe came prepared this time. They have sent their top geniuses.</p><p>Fu Liang frowned and said.</p><p>damn it, if it wasn’t for the rule that he’s under twenty years old, I’d go and kill him right now.</p><p>A third grade great Martial Master realm young man in his twenties said.</p><p>“I’ll go kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, another young man walked out and jumped down the city wall.</p><p>it’s Liu Cheng. He’s already reached the peak of the first grade great Martial Master realm. It’s said that he’s been bitterly cultivating a black grade low level martial arts technique during this period of time, and I reckon that he’s already somewhat proficient in it. I wonder if he’ll be able to put up a fight with the other party? ”</p><p>“If his black grade low level martial arts skill is cultivated to the second stage or above, he should be able to fight.”</p><p>Below, Liu Cheng quickly arrived in front of Bahe.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>BA he still had that calm and composed expression, and in his eyes, there was even a touch of contempt.</p><p>To be looked down upon by a barbarian of the eastern Barbarian race, Liu Cheng’s eyes flashed with killing intent. He unsheathed his sword and turned into a shooting star, striking BA he.</p><p>there’s definitely a second level to the meteor sword technique, or even more.</p><p>“There’s hope.”</p><p>However, before the disciple of the mystical sword sect could finish his sentence, he stopped abruptly.</p><p>Because BA he had struck out with his blade, and with a single strike, his head fell to the ground.</p><p>Liu Cheng was still killed by a single slash.</p><p>The sound of gasps rang out.</p><p>“How is that possible? How could the Dongyi tribe have such a powerful genius?”</p><p>to be able to kill Liu Cheng, who cultivated a profound grade martial skill and was at the peak of the first grade great Martial Master realm, with a single Saber Strike, how strong is his battle prowess? ”</p><p>“What’s his cultivation level?”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect were all shocked. They could no longer remain calm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
