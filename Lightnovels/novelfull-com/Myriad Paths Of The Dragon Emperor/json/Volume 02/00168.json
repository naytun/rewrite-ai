Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a few runs, he crossed the last few dozen meters and rushed into the cave.</p><p>After the two of them entered the cave, the flame spirit and the flames behind them slowly disappeared.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The two of them let out a long breath and then looked around.</p><p>This was an underground cave. It was very large, with a height of more than a hundred meters and a radius of more than a hundred meters.</p><p>The two of them glanced around and fixed their eyes on the center of the underground cave.</p><p>There was a human skeleton sitting cross-legged on the ground. The bones were as clear as Jade.</p><p>There was an altar behind the skeleton. It was made of stone and carved with patterns. It was filled with an ancient charm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the beautiful young lady only took a casual glance at these and ignored them. Their eyes were fixed on the two arms of the skeleton.</p><p>The skeleton’s right hand was holding a green jade sword. The Jade sword was very small, not much bigger than a finger.</p><p>On the left finger of the skeleton, there was a ring.</p><p>A storage ring. Lu Ming could tell at a glance that it was a storage ring.</p><p>This skeleton must have been an expert when it was alive, so its storage ring must be worth a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming and the girl in his character moved at the same time. The two of them turned into two rays of light and dashed toward the skeleton.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them arrived in front of the skeleton.</p><p>Lu Ming clawed at the storage ring on the skeleton’s finger, while the stunning young lady went for the Jade sword in the skeleton’s right hand.</p><p>Gathering his zhenqi, he formed a claw and grabbed the storage ring off the skeleton’s hand.</p><p>“It’s in my hands!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>At this moment, the beautiful young lady was also holding the Jade sword in her hand. The joy on her face was difficult to suppress.</p><p>Then, the beautiful young lady moved her hand and kept the Jade sword. She looked at Lu Ming and said,”Hey, kid, hand over your storage ring. We’ll split the things inside.”</p><p>“Half each? Are you kidding me? you take that Jade sword and I take the storage ring, so we each have one. What right do you have to split my storage ring?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Naturally, he would not give it up.</p><p>“Your appetite is too big. This is an interspatial ring left behind by a King. Its value is shocking, but I only took a Jade sword. It’s not fair. I don’t care, I want to split the things in the interspatial ring equally.”</p><p>The stunning young lady glared at him and said arrogantly.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He rolled his eyes and said,”How about this, how about we exchange? I’ll use my storage ring to exchange for that Jade sword so that you won’t say that I’ve taken advantage of you.”</p><p>“Why should I exchange with you? I won’t.”</p><p>The stunning young lady didn’t even think about it and directly rejected him.</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he laughed. He could tell that the value of the Jade sword was higher than that of the storage ring. This young girl had gotten a bargain, but she was still thinking about the storage ring.</p><p>“Then let’s have one each.”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with her and kept the storage ring.</p><p>What was there to say to this unreasonable woman?</p><p>“Hmph, if you don’t give it to me, then I’ll take it myself!”</p><p>The stunning young lady rolled her eyes and suddenly rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>hey, you swore before that you wouldn’t fight me. You’re going against your oath now.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he retreated quickly with his spear in hand.</p><p>“Hmph, I said before that I wouldn’t do anything when I get those secret manuals, but I didn’t say that I wouldn’t do anything here.”</p><p>The young girl coldly snorted as she quibbled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young lady waved her hand and unleashed the demonic palm imprint.</p><p>Three huge palm prints as black as ink struck toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear to block it.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s power of fire had increased, he was still not a match for the young lady. He was forced to retreat by the strong palm force.</p><p>“Let’s go to the fire formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he sprinted towards the passage from before.</p><p>When Lu Ming dashed into the passage, the surroundings shone with bright runes again. Then, flames and flame spirits appeared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>When the beautiful girl rushed in, many other flame spirits also rushed toward her.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The young girl shouted and struck out a few times in a row. She defeated five to six flame spirits and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming was really angry. He roared and waved his long spear. The surrounding flames were driven by him and followed the momentum of the spear. They condensed into a fire Dragon and blasted toward the young girl.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fire Dragon and the girl’s demonic palm collided.</p><p>The black genuine Qi and the fiery red flames exploded, sweeping in all directions. A few fire spirits nearby were directly blown away.</p><p>Lu Ming and the young girl swayed at the same time and they were equally matched.</p><p>In the fire formation, Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger while the young lady was suppressed. Lu Ming was completely able to fight her.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to take my storage ring! Now, I’m going to hit you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, waving his long spear and lashing it at the young girl.</p><p>“You …!”</p><p>The young girl gritted her teeth, and her pair of beautiful palms continuously struck out with dense palm energy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued as Lu Ming and the young girl exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>However, Lu Ming became more and more courageous as the battle progressed, while the young girl’s essential Qi was slowly depleting.</p><p>Previously, he had already expended a lot of energy to clear this passage. Now that he was fighting with Lu Ming, he naturally expended even more energy.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had the advantage of the environment. He did not consume much energy in the fire array.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After exchanging another blow with Lu Ming, the young girl retreated and left the passage.</p><p>Hmph, you win. I’m not going to fight with you anymore. I’m so tired!</p><p>The young girl retreated a distance and sat on the ground. She was drenched in sweat and panting.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward cautiously and finally left the range of the large array in the passage. As soon as he left, the flames in the passage disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not go too far away from the passageway. He sat cross-legged at the entrance so that if the young lady attacked, he could escape into the passageway at once.</p><p>alright, I won’t fight with you anymore. You’re lucky to have obtained such a great opportunity this time!</p><p>The young girl gritted her teeth and said, as if she was very unwilling to accept this.</p><p>“You should have gained more than me, right? We’re the same!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>I spent a lot of effort to get in here. You’ve gained a lot. Hmph, that’s it. I see you’re tired. Let’s adjust our breathing together. Don’t sneak an attack!</p><p>The young girl said unhappily.</p><p>“I’m afraid you’ll sneak attack me!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>After that, the two of them began to regulate their breathing. Of course, they both kept a part of their attention on each other, afraid that the other would suddenly attack.</p><p>Three hours later, the two of them stood up at the same time.</p><p>you’ve taken advantage of me before. Let’s see how you’re going to take advantage of me later.</p><p>The girl snorted coldly and walked toward the altar behind the skeleton.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
