You’re still as naive as ever!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you barged into the White Tiger Hall and killed The White Tiger Hall’s disciples for no reason. Now, you’re trying to kill my father. Do you know how serious of a crime you’ve committed? Quickly release my father!”</p><p>Lu Yao called out.</p><p>“Sin? What a joke! Lu yunxiong colluded with the Duanmu family to kill a member of the Lu family for no reason. He even tried to kill my mother. Now, I want to kill him. What crime is there to be guilty of?”</p><p>Lu Ming refuted loudly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Yao was shocked. Clearly, she did not know that Lu yunxiong had gone to the Lu family.</p><p>However, she was only slightly surprised before she returned to her original expression and said coldly, ” “I don’t care. Lu Ming, let go of my father!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’m begging you. I’m begging you to let me go. I’m in the wrong. Please show mercy.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong shouted. Clearly, he was really afraid.</p><p>“Show mercy? Haha, Lu yunxiong, it’s ridiculous for you to say something like that. Did you show any mercy to the core elder of the Lu family? If I hadn’t arrived in time, would you have shown mercy to my mother?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was getting colder and colder.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me give you a piece of advice. You’d better let him go, then kneel down and admit your guilt. This is your best choice. Otherwise, I, Duanmu Lin, will say that no one in the world can save you.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s hands were behind his back. His aura was extremely shocking as he spoke with a cold expression.</p><p>A haughty expression was revealed between his brows.</p><p>“No one in the world can save me? Who Do You Think You Are? The world was so big, and there were so many geniuses. Did he think that he was the number one in the world just because he had a little cultivation? You’re just a frog in a well.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Duanmu Lin and berated him.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was dumbstruck.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that Duanmu Lin was a frog at the bottom of a well? They were already in a mess.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s expression darkened.</p><p>“Nonsense! I’m going to kill Lu yunxiong right now. Let’s see what you can do to me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming berated. He then looked at Lu yunxiong and sneered,”Alright, Lu yunxiong, I’ll send you on your way now!”</p><p>“No, no, don’t. Lu Ming, don’t! I don’t want to die, help!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong screamed crazily. His eyes were filled with fear and hesitation.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Yao shouted.</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin berated.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He clenched his fist and the silver Palm suddenly closed. With a bang, Lu yunxiong was bombarded by a huge force and exploded.</p><p>Lu yunxiong was dead!</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Lu Yao shrieked. She then looked at Lu Ming and shouted madly, ” “Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I want you to die a horrible death!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s aura became even more violent. His face was extremely gloomy, and the killing intent that emanated from his body seemed to be tangible.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve made a very foolish choice.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s voice was cold. He waved his hand and Lu Yao landed on the ground.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Then, Duanmu Lin shouted and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as well and charged toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“They’ve made their move! Duanmu Lin and Lu Ming have made their move!”</p><p>Someone shouted in excitement.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was a peerless genius with extraordinary talent. He had awakened his bloodline at a very young age and had been unrivaled throughout his journey. No one in his age group was his match. He had suppressed geniuses with special bloodlines and was known as one of the four great geniuses of the mystical sword sect. Moreover, he was ranked first among the four great geniuses.</p><p>He had too many honors in the mystical sword sect and was believed to be a genius who would surpass Feng Wuji in the near future.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had only joined the mystical sword sect for slightly more than a year, but he had created many miracles.</p><p>The newcomer King had won first place on the bronze ranking in his first year and had comprehended force when he was in the master warrior realm.</p><p>Now, he had even charged into the White Tiger Hall for his family.</p><p>He was a lawless person.</p><p>The two of them were now facing off against each other, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>Which of them would win?</p><p>Everyone was staring at it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the two of them collided in the air.</p><p>Two rays of light, one silver and one black, glowed in the sky, occupying the entire sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the two voices flew back hundreds of meters.</p><p>“He’s much stronger than that silver-robed elder.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Duanmu Lin had just broken through to the martial ancestor realm not long ago, but his combat strength was not something that an ordinary 1-stage martial ancestor realm expert could compare to.</p><p>He was far more powerful than ordinary experts of the same level.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was also shocked.</p><p>After that-</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two of them charged forward at the same time.</p><p>Terrifying attacks poured towards the other party in a frenzy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a black leopard appeared. It was covered in lightning and had a horn on its head.</p><p>bloodline! That’s Duanmu Lin’s bloodline! The Azure flood Dragon Lightning Leopard is a seventh-grade bloodline. It’s said that it possesses the bloodline of a flood Dragon and is extremely powerful!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Great sun Thunder Blade slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin activated his bloodline power and roared. He slashed out with his saber, and endless saber radiance appeared and condensed into a huge sun.</p><p>The huge sun hung in the air with boundless power. It carried a terrifying and shocking saber radiance as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Earth rank martial skill, this is an earth rank martial skill!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Silver Wolf Moon howl!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, then he let out a loud roar, like a Wolf King.</p><p>Then, a huge Silver Wolf appeared.</p><p>This giant wolf was as large as a mountain. It howled at the sky and then a full moon appeared above its mouth.</p><p>The full moon emitted boundless radiance that blasted toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>This was the Silver Wolf daemon King’s abhijna. It was contained in the beast soul and Lu Ming could use it for a short time.</p><p>A sun and a full moon met in the sky, erupting with endless waves of air.</p><p>&Nbsp; the world was in chaos as energy shot out in all directions.</p><p>Between the sun and the moon, a beam of light shot up into the sky, creating a huge hole in the White clouds.</p><p>Everyone looked at the sky, dumbfounded. They looked at the sun, the moon, and the two young men.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared.</p><p>“You’re still far from it. I’ll break you!”</p><p>OWW!</p><p>Lu Ming howled like a Wolf. The silver glow on his body was so thick that it seemed to be tangible.</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>The pressure on Lu Ming’s body grew stronger and stronger, and he began to let out sizzling sounds. His entire body was in excruciating pain as if it was being torn apart. Fine beads of blood even seeped out of his pores.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care at all. He manically activated the power of the beast soul.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>In the sky, the mountain-like silver Wolf howled, and the full moon became even more resplendent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sun was suppressed. Its light quickly dimmed and it was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Then, with a loud boom, the sun trembled rapidly and exploded.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s body trembled and he fell to the ground like a cannonball.</p><p>At the same time, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Duanmu Lin had been injured and defeated.</p><p>There was an uproar.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
