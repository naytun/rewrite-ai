Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming stabbed two times in a row.</p><p>The two spears were as fast as lightning, like two meteors streaking across the sky. They were accompanied by scorching flames that illuminated the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, the two meteors suddenly exploded, and a terrifying and violent force instantly erupted.</p><p>From the place where the three of them clashed, waves of sword Qi, saber radiance, and scorching spear radiance swept outward.</p><p>Several silver-robed elders set up layers of defense, protecting the tables, chairs, and the other disciples of the four courtyards behind them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, a saber and a sword flew far away. At the same time, two screams were heard. Two figures were sent flying, and blood splattered in the sky.</p><p>It was Jian wuchen and the saber-hugging youth.</p><p>When the light dissipated, Lu Ming stood in the middle of the field with his spear in hand, not moving an inch.</p><p>He had won. Lu Ming had won.</p><p>He’d fought two geniuses from the Qilin Hall all by himself, and he’d still defeated them with just one move.</p><p>It was too tyrannical.</p><p>I don’t care what kind of genius you are, I don’t care what kind of special bloodline you have. One man, one spear, I can sweep the world.</p><p>Everyone seemed to see such a scene.</p><p>Both Jian wuchen and the saber-wielding youth’s clothes were torn and wounds appeared on their bodies. They were in a sorry state.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Jian wuchen step by step. He looked down at him and said indifferently, ” I’ve said before that I’ll definitely defeat you within three moves. Now, it’s exactly three moves!</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait. I’ll kill you one day.”</p><p>Jian wuchen glared at Lu Ming with a ferocious look in his eyes.</p><p>“Look, you’re here again. Didn’t you just say it? It’s a joke for people without ability to talk big. Now, you can’t even be considered a joke.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>tell me, just tell me. I, Jian wuchen, swear that I will return today’s humiliation to you ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times in the future. I will torture you. I will humiliate Qiu Yue in front of you. I will make you suffer so much that you wish you were dead. I will make you regret what you have done today.</p><p>Jian wuchen roared like a Mad Dog, and the killing intent in his eyes was so strong that it seemed to be tangible.</p><p>He already hated Lu Ming to the core. This b * stard, a piece of trash. He actually dared to injure and defeat him in front of so many people. In his opinion, this was a great humiliation.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t even think about humiliating others. In his opinion, it was only right.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, but there was a cold murderous intent in his smile.</p><p>I, Lu Ming, hate it when people threaten me. You shouldn’t have threatened me.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold. He did not hide the killing intent in his body at all.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s heart couldn’t help but turn cold as he cried out, ” “What do you want to do?”</p><p>“What are you doing? Didn’t you say you wanted to cripple me? Now, you’re threatening me. In order to avoid future trouble, I’ll naturally have to cripple you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Cripple me? You dare? Lu Ming, you piece of trash. Do you know who I am? I have a special bloodline, a disciple of Qilin Hall, the future Overlord of mystical sword sect, the future pillar of the sect. You dare to cripple me?”</p><p>Jian wuchen laughed as if he had heard a joke.</p><p>However, he could no longer continue laughing.</p><p>This was because he realized that Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and determined. He was unshakeable.</p><p>He felt a chill in his heart. A bone-piercing chill rose from his tailbone and went straight to the top of his head. He hurriedly shouted, ” “No, don’t …”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Lu Ming’s long spear had already pierced through his dantian, shattering the cyclone in his dantian.</p><p>Jian wuchen was stunned. After a while, he let out a heart-wrenching scream, ” ”</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had really crippled Jian wuchen’s cultivation.</p><p>Such a decisive character, such a ruthless method, and such great courage.</p><p>Jian wuchen was the peerless genius of Qilin Hall. He had a special bloodline and was the focus of the mystical sword sect’s cultivation. They had hidden him in secret for fear of being assassinated by other sects.</p><p>But now, his cultivation had been crippled by someone from his own sect.</p><p>“Good job. If it were me, I wouldn’t hesitate either.”</p><p>Ling Kong’s eyes flashed with ferocity as he coldly said.</p><p>The others were speechless. Who would be like you, a demonic beast that didn’t care about the consequences?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finished. You’ve crippled my cultivation, so you can’t escape. I’m a genius of Qilin Hall. The sect will definitely stand up for me. You’re dead.”</p><p>Jian wuchen was still shouting.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was extremely calm. He looked at Jian wuchen indifferently and said, ” “Idiot!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Jian wuchen was stunned.</p><p>“Let me ask you, what are you relying on?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly asked.</p><p>Jian wuchen clutched his dantian with all his might and was a little dazed.</p><p>It was the same for the others. They did not know why Lu Ming was asking this question.</p><p>what you’re relying on is nothing more than your special bloodline and your talent. You think you’re high and mighty because of your special bloodline, looking down on others and treating them like trash.</p><p>with your special bloodline, the sect has to protect you and spend a lot of resources to cultivate you. All of this is because of your bloodline and talent.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. I was born noble. Do you think I’m someone you can be envious of? ” Jian wuchen said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently and looked down at Jian wuchen. He said word by word, ” but now, your self-righteous talent is worse than trash in front of me. Your so-called talent is nothing in front of me.</p><p>“Do you think the sect will punish me, a person whose talent is far above yours, for a piece of trash like you whose cultivation has been crippled? Is that even possible?”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s every word was like a Thunderbolt, exploding in Jian wuchen’s mind.</p><p>That was right. Lu Ming’s talent was far above his. His value to the mystical sword sect was also far above his. Why would he punish Lu Ming for a good-for-nothing like him?</p><p>It was impossible. The higher-ups of the sect might even put in a lot of effort to nurture Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, no, it’s not like that. It can’t be, it can’t be.”</p><p>Jian wuchen roared in despair. He could not accept this.</p><p>He knew that if he was crippled, he would only be crippled for nothing. The sect would definitely not stand up for him.</p><p>At the scene, everyone else also came to a realization. That was indeed the case.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent could already be compared to geniuses like Duanmu Lin and Feng Wuji. Ordinary special bloodlines were no match for him, so why would he punish him severely?</p><p>today is brother mu Yun’s big day. Take him and get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming no longer looked at Jian wuchen, who was like a pile of mud. He turned his gaze to the saber-hugging youth.</p><p>At this moment, the saber-hugging youth and the burly youth were already scared out of their wits. They didn’t dare to say anything and quickly dragged the still-shouting Jian wuchen out of the sword-dance courtyard.</p><p>The storm that threatened the honor of the bronze rank ended in a hurry because of Lu Ming’s arrival.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
