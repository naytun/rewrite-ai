His tall body was like a chariot, charging toward Lu Ming in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Duan gang was a close-combat expert, so he had to close the distance.</p><p>“Fire gun art-broken armor!”</p><p>As soon as he made his move, Lu Ming used the armor fragment. The penetrative power of this move was extremely strong, second only to the last move,’explosion’.</p><p>“Black turtle protection!”</p><p>Duan gang didn’t hesitate and executed his defensive martial skill, and five tortoiseshell-shaped shields appeared.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear struck one of the shields, and it actually made a sound of metal clashing.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if the long spear had stabbed into an Iron Mountain. The long spear bent into a bow shape. Lu Ming borrowed the rebound of the long spear and drifted backward.</p><p>“What a strong defense!”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of admiration.</p><p>However, he did not know that Duan gang’s shock was even greater than his.</p><p>He felt that his defense was almost penetrated by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>“Is this Lu Ming’s ultimate move? If he isn’t, then he’s too powerful. He’s even stronger than bu xingkai.”</p><p>Duan gang was shocked but he did not stop and continued to rush toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His hand was like an eagle’s claw, and he struck out a dozen sharp claw lights.</p><p>“Fire dance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear trembled and flames appeared one after another, destroying Duan gang’s claw radiance. Then, more than ten flame flowers landed on Duan gang’s protective shield, causing ripples.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming took advantage of the momentum and jumped up, his long spear smashing down on Duan gang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear smashed into Duan gang’s protective shield, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Duan gang’s expression changed drastically, and his body staggered backward. He took five or six steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>he’s retreating. Duan gang has retreated. He’s so strong. I feel that Lu Ming’s attack is even stronger than when he was fighting Ling Kong yesterday.</p><p>that’s right. Did he hide his strength yesterday? ”</p><p>“This is unbelievable!”</p><p>On the viewing platform, Ling Kong’s eyes revealed a beastly glint as he muttered,”This guy was clearly at the fourth level yesterday, but he’s already at the fifth level today. Could it be that he broke through last night? That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>As soon as Duan gang retreated, Lu Ming cast the attack with the largest area of effect, moon canvass.</p><p>A crescent moon formed and heavily struck Duan gang’s protective shield.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Duan gang retreated again.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>Then, he became one with the spear and arrived as fast as lightning.</p><p>This spear attack once again caused Duan gang’s protective shield to tremble.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Duan gang roared and threw a few punches in succession. He charged at Lu Ming without a care and shouted,”Lu Ming, if you have a unique skill, you should use it as soon as possible. You can’t break my defense like this.”</p><p>From the start of the competition, he had been suppressed by Lu Ming. He was really aggrieved. In this case, he could not get close to Lu Ming at all. It was impossible for him to win. If he wanted to lose, he might as well lose in a straightforward manner.</p><p>“Alright, as you wish!”</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>All the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body surged out and rushed toward the long spear, gathering at the tip of the spear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, the spear streaked across the sky and once again stabbed into Duan gang’s protective shield.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the genuine Qi at the tip of the spear suddenly erupted like a volcano that had been accumulating for thousands of years, erupting with a powerful and shocking destructive power.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Duan gang’s protective shield cracked and then exploded with a bang.</p><p>Then, Duan gang let out a blood-curdling screech, and his body flew far away. His entire body was covered in blood.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>As Duan gang flew out, all the disciples of the four courtyards let out a long breath.</p><p>Lu Ming has won. He’s in the top five. It’s a sure thing.</p><p>“I wonder who’s stronger, him or bu xingkai?”</p><p>“It seems to be Lu Ming.”</p><p>In the area of The White Tiger Hall, everyone from the Duanmu family had ugly expressions on their faces. Lu Yao and Lu yunxiong were even more so. They were gritting their teeth so hard that they were about to shatter.</p><p>However, the Vermillion Bird hall area was filled with cheers.</p><p>This was because after Lu Ming defeated Duan gang, the Vermillion Bird Hall would not be last in this year’s competition no matter what. In the fighting ring, Duan gang got up and said with a bitter smile, ” Junior Brother Lu Ming is indeed powerful. I’m sincerely convinced of my defeat.</p><p>His physical body was extremely strong, so he didn’t suffer too serious of an injury and could recover very quickly.</p><p>“Senior brother Duan is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the winner of this round. The second round is over. We’ll move on to the third round later.”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Soon, the third round began.</p><p>In this round, Lu Ming’s opponent was Duanmu Chen.</p><p>There was no suspense in the battle between Lu Ming and Duanmu Chen. Lu Ming had suppressed Duanmu Chen throughout the entire battle and won in just a dozen moves.</p><p>As for the others, those who had encountered Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang had all admitted defeat.</p><p>Because there was no need to fight, it was better to save strength for the later matches.</p><p>In the fourth round, Lu Ming versus Dong CE. Without a doubt, he won easily.</p><p>In this round, he was up against bu xingkai.</p><p>The battle between the two of them was extremely intense. They fought for more than a hundred moves. In the end, bu xingkai was the one who won and defeated Ling Kong.</p><p>In the fifth round, Lu Ming was up against bu xingkai.</p><p>This competition caused the entire place to boil with excitement.</p><p>Because this battle could be said to be a battle for the third place.</p><p>If Lu Ming won, there would be no problem for him to get third place.</p><p>If bu xingkai won, the third place would be his.</p><p>Moreover, both of them used guns, so it was more meaningful.</p><p>In the fighting ring, the two of them stood opposite each other, each holding a spear.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s decide the winner with one move. How about it?”</p><p>Bu xingkai said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Good, that’s just what I want.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>One shot to decide the outcome?</p><p>Everyone was stunned for a moment, then they watched with even more excitement.</p><p>A single shot to decide the outcome was more dangerous, but also more exciting.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura suddenly burst out from the two of them. Their auras collided and the two of them rushed out at the same time.</p><p>“Toxic Dragon drill!”</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>The two of them executed their ultimate moves almost at the same time.</p><p>The two spear shadows instantly cut through the void and collided together.</p><p>It was as if two stars had collided. On the fighting stage, with the point of intersection of the two spears as the core, two colors emerged.</p><p>One was fiery red and the other was black. The two colors were clearly separated and did not give in to each other.</p><p>However, the stalemate only lasted for a moment. Suddenly, the fiery red side erupted like a volcano. A powerful force gushed out and instantly suppressed the black side.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A figure flew far away and fell heavily on the ground. Without a doubt, it was bu xingkai.</p><p>Bu xingkai had lost, and his injuries were much more serious than Duan gang’s.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster smacked his seat, his face dark.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall’s head burst into laughter.</p><p>“Lu Ming wins!”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>there’s no doubt that Lu Ming will be third!</p><p>“Oh my God! Didn’t that mean that Lu Ming has broken senior brother Feng Wuji’s record? that’s terrifying!” Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“In that case, wouldn’t there be a genius even stronger than senior brother Feng Wuji in the mystical sword sect?”</p><p>that’s hard to say. Being strong now doesn’t mean that you’ll be strong in the future. There will be many difficulties in the future. In history, there have been many people who were amazing in their youth, but when they grow up, their achievements are only average.</p><p>that’s true, but breaking senior brother Feng Wuji’s record is already shocking enough.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
