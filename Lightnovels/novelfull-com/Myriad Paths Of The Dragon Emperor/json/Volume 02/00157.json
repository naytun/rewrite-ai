They are not afraid of death and only know how to attack. Their bodies are as hard as iron and invulnerable. Their eyes are their only weakness. Attack their eyes!</p><p>An elder of the Dongyi tribe shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Under the lead of two fourth grade great Martial Master realm elders, a dozen Dongyi experts attacked the eyes of the eight demonic corpses with all their might.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not long after, a demonic beast’s eyes were shattered. It let out a loud roar and fell down.</p><p>They found a way. The dozen Dongyi Warriors worked together and soon defeated the eight beasts one by one.</p><p>let’s go in. If I’m not wrong, this must be an important place!</p><p>An Eastern Barbarian old man shouted excitedly.</p><p>Over ten Dongyi people rushed into the cave excitedly.</p><p>After the Dongyi tribe left, Lu Ming appeared and followed them into the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps landed on the ground without a sound. He followed more than ten meters behind the Dongyi people and held his breath. The other party did not notice him at all.</p><p>After passing through numerous courtyards, they arrived at a large hall in the middle.</p><p>From afar, he could see the door of the hall open, revealing the bookshelves in the hall.</p><p>haha, this is the library. There must be some secret books here. This is great. There is hope for the revival of the Dongyi tribe!</p><p>An Eastern Barbarian old man shouted excitedly.</p><p>Over a dozen Eastern wasteland people were all excited.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>With two roars, two huge demonic beasts rushed out of the hall. They were as fast as lightning and were filled with a murderous aura.</p><p>Two shrieks rang out as the two Dongyi men were torn in half by the two beasts. Blood and internal organs flew everywhere.</p><p>“It’s another demonic corpse and demonic puppet. Be careful!”</p><p>With a furious roar, the two fourth grade great Martial Master realm elders pounced toward the two demon beasts.</p><p>These two demonic beasts were also hairless, but their muscles were firm as if they were cast from gold and iron.</p><p>“Evil creature, die!”</p><p>The two old men roared and slashed their sabers at the eyes of the two demonic beasts.</p><p>However, these two demonic corpses and demonic puppets were obviously stronger than the previous two. They extended their claws and blocked the two men’s sabers.</p><p>The demonic corpse and the puppet kept roaring. The evil Qi on their bodies was extremely strong. They didn’t fear death at all. They rushed toward the Dongyi people.</p><p>Bang! Bang …</p><p>Several first and second grade Grandmaster realm Warriors were sent flying by the demonic beast. Only Warriors above the third grade Grandmaster realm could fight it head-on.</p><p>For a moment, the Dongyi people were locked in a fierce battle with the two demonic beasts.</p><p>At this moment, a figure silently passed through the crowd like a gust of wind and rushed into the hall.</p><p>“Who is it? Damn it! Stop right there!”</p><p>A fourth grade great Martial Master elder bellowed, and a sharp blade-light slashed toward the figure.</p><p>This figure was, of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, he would not let go of such an opportunity.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear swept out and blocked the old man’s saber. Lu Ming borrowed the force and rushed into the hall at an even faster speed.</p><p>“You guys have fun, I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long laugh and leaped into the hall.</p><p>The Dongyi people roared in anger.</p><p>“You guys charge in and kill that little brat. We’ll hold off the two demonic corpses and demonic puppets!”</p><p>The two fourth grade great Martial Master realm elders bellowed and unleashed their bloodline power to block the two demonic corpses.</p><p>The others took the opportunity to rush into the hall.</p><p>“Little bastard, go to hell!”</p><p>A third grade great Martial Master burly man bellowed. His killing intent surged like the tide, and his saber swept toward Lu Ming with a rolling saber radiance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, what welcomed him was a lightning-like spear radiance.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Lu Ming’s spear had pierced through the strong man’s heart.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily kill a third grade Grandmaster.</p><p>After that, he swept the long spear horizontally, and the two second grade great Martial Master realm men were also sent flying. They were no longer breathing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had killed three great experts.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The others turned pale with fright and hurriedly retreated.</p><p>“Let’s kill these two demonic beasts together and then go kill that little bastard. He won’t be able to escape.”</p><p>A fourth grade great Martial Master elder shouted.</p><p>The Dongyi people were fighting the two beasts with all their might.</p><p>In the hall, Lu Ming’s eyes were glowing as he sized up his surroundings.</p><p>There were more than a dozen bookshelves in the hall. Lu Ming glanced at them and was disappointed.</p><p>Most of the bookshelves were empty. How could there be any secret manuals?</p><p>He had probably been taken away by the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>“Hey, there’s a box over there!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a black box in an unremarkable corner of the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he hurried over.</p><p>It was unknown what metal the box was made of. It was black and rusty. Lu Ming released his essential Qi and opened the box.</p><p>Immediately, stacks of books were revealed to Lu Ming. There were dozens of books.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he quickly picked up a book.</p><p>These secret manuals were naturally not made of ordinary paper, but from an unknown material that was extremely tough. Even after so many years, they were still in perfect condition.</p><p>He opened it and saw that it was a sword technique.</p><p>“Tiger roar sword technique, yellow grade upper class martial arts technique!”</p><p>It revealed the words inside.</p><p>“It’s only a yellow grade upper level martial arts technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly disappointed. He then looked at the other secret manuals.</p><p>Most of these secret manuals were yellow grade martial skills.</p><p>There were 32 books in total.</p><p>Among them, there were twenty yellow grade low level martial arts techniques and ten yellow grade high level martial arts techniques.</p><p>There were only two black level low level martial arts techniques and they were all sword techniques. Lu Ming could not use them at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly disappointed.</p><p>no wonder they were piled up in a box and placed in this corner. They were not taken away. They were thrown here like garbage.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p><p>“Am I being too greedy? Although these secret manuals are low-level, they can be sold for at least tens of millions of silver taels.”</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a burning light.</p><p>If these manuals were to be exchanged for contribution points in the contribution Hall, they would be worth at least a few hundred thousand contribution points. This was already a huge harvest.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming kept all these secret manuals in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“Little bastard, hand over the secret manual, or else, die!”</p><p>At this moment, the Dongyi people had finally finished off the two demonic corpses and rushed into the hall.</p><p>When they saw the empty book shelf, their eyes turned red and they looked at Lu Ming with great enthusiasm.</p><p>The bookshelf was empty. Lu Ming must have taken it.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to explain. He sneered and said,”I didn’t want to fight you just now. Do you really think I’m afraid of you?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed toward the Dongyi people like the wind.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The Dongyi tribe roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>With two fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts as the leaders, the ten of them joined forces and their power was astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and he dodged to the front. In a flash, he appeared at the side.</p><p>“Fire dance!”</p><p>Flowers of fire appeared. By the time the flowers of fire dissipated, three Dongyi Warriors had already fallen. Their throats had been pierced by the spear.</p><p>“Argh! Kill!”</p><p>The two fourth grade great Martial Master elders ‘roars shook the sky. Their blade gleams soared into the sky and directly swept the roof of the main hall away. Debris flew everywhere and all of them were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
