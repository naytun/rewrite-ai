The other party is a martial Grandmaster. Even if we work together, we’re no match for him!</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed softly.</p><p>“I’m not Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Suddenly, the young lady cast a glance at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Not Xie nianqing? How was that possible?</p><p>He looked exactly like Xie nianqing, how could he not be?</p><p>What was this girl up to this time?</p><p>wait a minute. That’s not right. This woman is different from Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look. Indeed, although this woman looked exactly the same as Xie nianqing, there were still some differences.</p><p>First of all, this woman should be older than Xie nianqing by a year or two.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked younger than Lu Ming, while this woman was about the same age as Lu Ming.</p><p>Also, the temperament was completely different.</p><p>Xie nianqing was like a little devil.</p><p>This woman, on the other hand, had a calm expression, like a fairy who was above the common populace.</p><p>“How can there be two people so similar in this world!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. The Golden Wolf killer flew to the sky above the purple bamboo forest.</p><p>Behind him, two silver Wolf killers also rushed over.</p><p>haha, it turns out that she’s such a beautiful lady. Good, good. It’s a good time to kill this Lu Ming kid and have a good time!</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer’s eyes lit up when he saw the young woman’s face, and then revealed a burning light.</p><p>He secretly exclaimed that he was really lucky to be able to meet such a peerless beauty when he was chasing after Lu Ming. This trip was not a waste.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer’s words made the young woman’s eyes flash with cold killing intent. Her originally cold face became even colder.</p><p>“Demon slaughtering array, rise!”</p><p>Suddenly, the young woman shouted and formed a seal with her hands. Runes appeared out of thin air and flew into the purple bamboo forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the purple bamboo forest, there was a soft cry. Then, rays of white light shot into the sky.</p><p>The white light gathered in the air and formed a white sword Qi.</p><p>As the sword Qi moved, a shocking killing intent filled the air.</p><p>“Inscription formation, so you set up an inscription formation here, but so what if there is an inscription formation? You’re just a Grandmaster realm martial artist, what can you do to me?”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer sneered.</p><p>“Demon slaying formation, slay the demons!”</p><p>The young woman shouted and waved her hands. In the air, three white sword Qi danced and made a terrible whistling sound, heading towards the Golden Wolf killer.</p><p>“Demon slaughtering array? let’s see who you can kill! Break!”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer swung his sword, and three bright sword Qi shot toward the White sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The explosion sounded, but it did not break the young woman’s inscription formation as the Golden Wolf killer had expected.</p><p>The sword Qi collided and disappeared together.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer was shocked.</p><p>However, the young woman waved her hand again, and the white light in the purple bamboo forest grew brighter. In an instant, more than ten white sword Qi condensed in the air.</p><p>“Not good, you guys quickly retreat!”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer’s face changed and he shouted at the two silver Wolf killers.</p><p>“It’s too late!”</p><p>The young woman’s voice seemed to be emotionless and cold.</p><p>As the voice fell, the White sword Qi in the air also crossed the void.</p><p>Two shrieks were heard as the two seventh grade great Martial Master Silver Wolf assassins were pierced by the sword Qi and died in the forest.</p><p>At the same time, more sword Qi rushed towards the Golden Wolf killer.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer roared in anger. With a flash of blood-red light, a giant black Wolf appeared.</p><p>There were eight blood-red chakras on the huge Wolf’s body.</p><p>This was the second bloodline awakening of the Golden Wolf killer.</p><p>The second bloodline was a level eight ordinary bloodline.</p><p>With the eruption of his bloodline, the Golden Wolf killer’s combat strength increased greatly, and he slashed out a dozen times in an instant.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>In the sky, sword Qi crisscrossed. Streaks of black sword Qi and white sword Qi clashed, and terrifying sword Qi shot out in all directions.</p><p>“Demon slaughtering array, God slaying!”</p><p>go! the young woman shouted. Dazzling white light spread out from her body, making her look extremely Holy. In the purple bamboo forest, the inscription formation was even more powerful.</p><p>The sword Qi seemed to appear endlessly, bombarding the Golden Wolf killer.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a scream.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as one of the Golden Wolf killer’s arms was cut off.</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer howled and became one with his sword. He turned into a bright sword light and shot up into the sky, out of the attack range of the inscription formation.</p><p>damn it! I’ll remember today’s great enmity. The two of you will face the endless pursuit of my Shadow Wolf Pavilion!</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer roared, filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>Then, it turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>The young woman sighed softly, as if it was a pity that she couldn’t make him stay.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>This woman’s methods were truly astonishing.</p><p>He had actually used an inscription formation to cut off one of the Golden Wolf killer’s arms.</p><p>Although the Golden Wolf killer’s cultivation was at the first level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, this woman’s cultivation was only at the sixth grade great master realm.</p><p>The gap between a martial Grandmaster and a martial Grandmaster was huge and difficult to cross.</p><p>what a terrifying formation. Who is this woman? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>alright, the other party has already left. You should leave too!</p><p>The young woman looked at Lu Ming with her beautiful eyes.</p><p>Her voice was still cold, like an unapproachable fairy.</p><p>“May I know why you saved me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He was a little curious. He had never met this woman before, so why did she spend so much effort to save him and even fight with a martial arts Grandmaster?</p><p>He didn’t think that he had such great charm, and from the young woman’s expression, it didn’t seem to be because of his charm.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>At this moment, a bolt of lightning flashed from the depths of the purple bamboo forest.</p><p>No, that wasn’t lightning. It was a leopard, a Lightning Leopard.</p><p>“Lightning Leopard!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He remembered that when he had just joined the mystical sword sect, he had let go of a Lightning Leopard cub and obtained a little lightning Leopard blood during the assessment.</p><p>Although the lightning Leopard in front of him wasn’t a Cub, it was still very young and similar to the lightning Leopard cub from before.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>When the lightning Leopard appeared, it glared at Lu Ming and barked a few times. Then, it moved closer to Lu Ming and rubbed its head against his thigh.</p><p>“You, are you the one from back then?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The lightning Leopard nodded.</p><p>It really was the lightning Leopard cub from back then. What a coincidence!</p><p>“If you hadn’t saved little Shan once, would I have saved you this time?”</p><p>The young woman’s voice sounded.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
