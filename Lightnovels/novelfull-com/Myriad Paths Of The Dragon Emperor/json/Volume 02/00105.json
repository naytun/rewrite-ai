Although he’s only ranked 51st, no one knows if he has any trump cards. But I guess that even if he does, he won’t be much stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Why?” Pang Shi asked.</p><p>“Because Yao Tianyu was afraid.”</p><p>“Are you afraid? He’s going to have a life-and-death battle with Lu Ming. Why would he be afraid?”</p><p>Pang Shi asked in surprise.</p><p>“It’s precisely because he wants to have a life-and-death battle that he is afraid. Lu Ming is too talented. Yao Tianyu knows that if he doesn’t get rid of Lu Ming now, he will not have a chance in the future. He is afraid of Lu Ming’s talent. That’s why he wants to get rid of Lu Ming now.”</p><p>Hua Chi analyzed.</p><p>“Isn’t lu Ming in danger?” Pang Shi’s expression changed.</p><p>“Not necessarily, Lu Ming. I’ve seen through him from the beginning.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>Just then, a few graceful figures appeared in the southern stands. It was Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and the others.</p><p>It was obvious that they had rushed over after receiving the news that Lu Ming was challenging the bronze platform.</p><p>Elder Mu Lan, Senior Sister Feng Wu.</p><p>Pang Shi immediately greeted him when he saw him.</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and the others went up to pang Shi and the others, and the others made way for them.</p><p>Lu Ming has really made it onto the bronze ranking. But isn’t it a little too hasty to have a life-and-death battle with Yao Tianyu now? ”</p><p>Feng Wu was both amazed and worried.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Lu Ming is very meticulous and not so impulsive. Moreover, since the first day I met him, he has repeatedly exceeded my understanding. I believe that he will not disappoint me today.”</p><p>Mu Lan smiled.</p><p>Her smile was incomparably charming, causing some of the hot-blooded male disciples to stare with their mouths agape. Some of them even drooled.</p><p>It was too alluring.</p><p>At this moment, not only Mu Lan and the others, but some other people had also come to the stands. Even a few more geniuses on the bronze rank had come.</p><p>Clearly, they had all rushed over after hearing the news.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, on the fighting ring, Lu Ming and Yao Tianyu both released a powerful aura.</p><p>Their auras collided in the air, forming a strong wind that swept through the surroundings.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll let you see my true abilities now.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu howled and a saber appeared in his hand. He took a step forward and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A ray of saber radiance burst out. The pale-white saber radiance was more than ten meters long. It cut through the air and the space, slashing toward Lu Ming’s head with a terrifying aura.</p><p>“The martial technique that made Yao Tianyu famous, black grade low level saber technique, wind-breaking eight slashes.”</p><p>As soon as Yao Tianyu made his move, someone cried out in surprise.</p><p>“As expected, I’ve successfully cultivated a profound rank martial skill. Let me test its power.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He stomped on the ground heavily and shot forward, his sword slashing at Yao Tianyu’s saber.</p><p>For the time being, he didn’t need to use his spear technique.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely strong. The huge sword in his hand was as light as a feather.</p><p>The giant sword slashed out and destroyed Yao Tianyu’s blade light. The giant sword then heavily hit Yao Tianyu’s saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out, and sparks flew in all directions. The two of them quickly retreated at the same time.</p><p>The first move was a tie.</p><p>“He blocked it. Lu Ming actually blocked Yao Tianyu’s Black level saber technique.”</p><p>Lu Ming must have cultivated the path of body-tempering. With his strong physical body and the integration of martial arts, he was able to unleash a powerful combat power. That’s how he managed to block Yao Tianyu’s Black level saber technique.</p><p>physical body against black level saber techniques. Who is stronger? ”</p><p>The disciples of the four halls were all staring at the scene.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how many of my attacks you can block?”</p><p>Yao Tianyu let out a long howl and attacked like a tidal wave. Saber radiance burst forth and tore through the air, aiming for Lu Ming once again.</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his huge sword and engaged Yao Tianyu in a fierce battle.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Violent collisions kept happening, and the sound of explosions continued. The powerful saber radiance and sword Qi surged out, forming a powerful storm that swept in all directions.</p><p>At the same time, sword Qi and saber radiance slashed the fighting ring.</p><p>However, the fighting stage was extremely hard, and there were even inscriptions on it. Even martial grandmasters couldn’t break it. Sword Qi and Saber Light didn’t leave a mark on it.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than thirty moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, it seems that you’ve only cultivated the black level saber technique to the second stage. If that’s all you’ve got, then you should just die.”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl as his essential Qi surged. He exerted all his strength, and the strength of his essential Qi and physical body exploded.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not display the blood Meridian and the ‘fire’ force.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The combat sword cut through the void, making a terrifying buzzing sound. This sword was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>“Lu Ming did not use his full strength just now.”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s eyes narrowed. Then, a blood-red light flashed on his body, and a huge Mantis with five blood-red chakras appeared.</p><p>Then, the Mantis burrowed itself into Yao Tianyu’s body, and the aura on Yao Tianyu’s body intensified.</p><p>Bloodline explosion!</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s bloodline was that of the dual-blade Mantis, which greatly enhanced his blade techniques. With the activation of his bloodline, Yao Tianyu’s blade techniques became even sharper and more powerful.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was another explosion, and the two of them retreated again.</p><p>After Lu Ming took a step back, he stomped on the ground and charged forward again. Yao Tianyu did the same.</p><p>The two of them were like two cannonballs, heavily crashing together.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In just a few breaths, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>At the scene, everyone held their breath as they watched unblinkingly. It was too intense and exciting.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With another move, the two of them trembled and slid back a dozen meters before they could stabilize themselves.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, is this your full strength? I’m really disappointed. As soon as two minutes are up, your bloodline power will disappear, and you won’t be able to fight me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, the entire venue was filled with whispers.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. Once the time for Yao Tianyu’s Blood Meridian outbreak was over, how was he going to fight Lu Ming?</p><p>how can this be? how can Lu Ming be so powerful? ”</p><p>The few young men who followed Yao Tianyu shouted in disbelief.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, I admit that you’re very strong. It’s not bad that you can force me to this point. Now, I’ll show you my true strength. I was planning to use it in the great competition of the four courtyards in two months. It’s your honor to use it on you.</p><p>At this moment, Yao Tianyu was not afraid. Instead, he laughed out loud.</p><p>Then, Yao Tianyu took a step forward, and the fighting ring rumbled. Yao Tianyu’s muscles quickly bulged, and a faint black light appeared on his skin, making him look like a black iron.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
