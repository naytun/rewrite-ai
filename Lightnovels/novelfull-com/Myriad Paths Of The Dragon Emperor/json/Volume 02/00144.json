He strolled around the various scenic spots on Vermilion Bird Peak.</p><p>He would only take two hours a day to cultivate the true war Dragon technique and temper his true Qi.</p><p>After seven days of rest, Lu Ming was full of energy. He emptied his mind and body, casting all negative emotions, stress, and worries aside.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, do you want to attend the class? there will be an elder giving a lecture on the basic knowledge of Alchemy today.”</p><p>Pang Shi asked Lu Ming in the courtyard.</p><p>basic knowledge of alchemy? ”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed an interested look.</p><p>Even if a martial artist was not an Alchemist and did not know how to refine pills, it would still be of great help to him if he could understand some basic medicinal knowledge.</p><p>For example, it would be awkward if you encountered a precious spirit herb in the wild but didn’t recognize it.</p><p>In addition, there were some spiritual herbs that needed to be picked carefully. If you picked them randomly, you would lose their medicinal properties.</p><p>On the other hand, the true war Dragon technique that Lu Ming cultivated often required many ingredients to be mixed together. Although there was a secret recipe in the true war Dragon technique, it would be much easier to concoct it if one knew some medicinal knowledge.</p><p>Lu Ming had long wanted to learn some basic medicinal knowledge.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked out with pang Shi.</p><p>It was still the square where he had attended the last class. At this time, there were already hundreds of people here.</p><p>“It’s senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Hello, senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Those who came to listen to the basic pharmacology course were all new disciples. They greeted Lu Ming respectfully when they saw him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was their idol.</p><p>He was in the same batch as them, but his achievements were worlds apart. Many of them had yet to break through to the Martial Master realm.</p><p>There were even many young female disciples who would glance at Lu Ming with their big, watery eyes from time to time.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and pretended not to know.</p><p>“Eh? How come it’s elder Mu Lan?”</p><p>Beside him, pang Shi exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He lifted his head and saw a figure slowly walking toward him from the square. It was Mu Lan.</p><p>Mu Lan’s gaze swept across the entire scene. When she saw Lu Ming, she was slightly stunned. Her eyes flickered for a moment before she returned to normal and said, today, I’ll teach you some basic knowledge of alchemy. Most of you may not be able to become alchemists, but it’s good to know more. Now, I’ll start with the basic preparation and identification of medicinal herbs.</p><p>Then, Mu Lan went on and on, talking about some basic knowledge of alchemy. Lu Ming listened attentively.</p><p>Mu Lan’s lecture went on for a few hours. Lu Ming was mesmerized and felt that he had learned a lot.</p><p>“Could it be that Senior Sister Mu Lan is also an inscriber?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>alright, that’s all for today. You can go back!</p><p>Mu Lan announced. Then, she looked at Lu Ming and her eyes flickered.”Lu Ming, you stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The others cast their gazes on Lu Ming. Then, they thought of the rumors they had heard recently.</p><p>“Elder Mu Lan asked Lu Ming to stay behind again. Could it be that the rumors I heard are true?”</p><p>“No way. Lu Ming really likes elder Mu Lan?”</p><p>that’s normal. Any man would like it. I like it too.</p><p>Instantly, the entire place broke out into a wave of whispers.</p><p>“Still not retreating!”</p><p>Mu Lan frowned and shouted.</p><p>The others were shocked and quickly left.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, good luck!”</p><p>Before pang Shi left, he even gave Lu Ming an encouraging look. Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched and he was speechless.</p><p>Soon, only Lu Ming and Mu Lan were left in the square.</p><p>“Cough, cough!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard that you defeated a genius from Qilin Hall in three moves. That’s beyond my expectations,” Mu Lan coughed dryly.</p><p>thank you for your praise, Senior Sister Mu Lan. I was just lucky!</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>but I have to tell you that the divine wilderness continent is vast and boundless. There are countless empires. The blazing sun Empire is just a drop in the ocean in front of the entire divine wilderness continent. Naturally, there are countless geniuses. Although you have made some achievements now, compared to those true monsters, there is still a huge gap.</p><p>that’s why you can’t slack off. At your age, you have to focus on cultivation. You can’t think about anything else.</p><p>Mu Lan warned him seriously.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Mu Lan had finally reached the main point.</p><p>“I’ve been working hard on my cultivation. I wonder what other matters Senior Sister Mu Lan is referring to?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked despite knowing the answer.</p><p>“This … You don’t know?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes flickered as she said.</p><p>“Of course I don’t know. I’ve been in closed-door cultivation all this time, so I don’t know what happened.” Lu Ming continued to play dumb.</p><p>“That … This …”</p><p>Mu Lan’s face was. little red. Her beautiful eyes were misty. She hesitated for. long time before she gritted her teeth and said, ” during this period of time, there have been rumors outside that you … The person you like is … It’s me, is that true?”</p><p>“Ah? There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately got a shock. He then held his chin with one hand and sized Mu Lan up.</p><p>Mu Lan felt uneasy. She glared at him and said,”Lu Ming, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, you’re so devastatingly beautiful, which man wouldn’t be moved by your beauty?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer the question. There was an inexplicable smile on his lips.</p><p>“Could it be that the rumors are true?” Mu Lan’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and slowly approached Mu Lan, his eyes looking straight into her eyes.</p><p>Mu Lan’s face was flushed red and her heart was beating like thunder. Her beautiful eyes were filled with tears and she looked flustered.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly smiled and said,”Fake!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned around and left while laughing, leaving Mu Lan with a dazed expression.</p><p>After a long while, Mu Lan’s clenched teeth and shouted, ” “Lu Ming …”</p><p>Lu Ming, who had already walked far away, suddenly shivered inexplicably.</p><p>“Did you play it just now?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. However, at the thought of Mu Lan’s embarrassed look just now, he was in a good mood and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, did you succeed?”</p><p>A figure suddenly jumped out from a pile of grass at the side. Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Nest, big rock, what are you hiding here for?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless when he saw that it was pang Shi.</p><p>“Of course, I’m waiting for your good news, senior brother Lu Ming. I saw senior brother Lu Ming smiling foolishly the entire way. Did you succeed in your confession?”</p><p>Pang Shi’s eyes glowed.</p><p>“What confession? Big rock, don’t talk nonsense. I think you’ve been led astray by that boy-crazy guy.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>“Isn’t that the case?”</p><p>Pang Shi scratched his head.</p><p>of course not. Big rock, I’m telling you, don’t talk nonsense when you go out. Also, don’t listen to the nonsense of that love-struck fool.</p><p>Lu Ming reminded him solemnly and seriously.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
