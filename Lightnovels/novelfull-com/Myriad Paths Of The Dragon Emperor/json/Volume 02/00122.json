Duan gang’s physical body should have reached the amazing complete grade two, while bu xingkai’s is in the upper tier of grade two.</p><p>but Duan gang is focused on defense. Although he has also cultivated an offensive dark level martial skill, he has only cultivated it to the third level. On the other hand, bu xingkai’s spear technique has already reached the fifth level. As time goes on, bu xingkai will definitely win. Or, if bu xingkai has a killing move, he will win soon.</p><p>Mu Lan looked at Lu Ming in surprise and said,”Lu Ming, you have good taste. Look, bu xingkai is about to use his ultimate move.”</p><p>At this moment, bu xingkai leaped up from the fighting ring. His body was more than 20 meters high. Then, he pointed his long spear downward and stabbed toward Duan gang.</p><p>“Toxic Dragon drill!”</p><p>go! bu xingkai shouted. As he descended, the spear started to spin rapidly with the tip of the spear as the center.</p><p>Indistinctly, a black evil Dragon could be seen emerging with astonishing might.</p><p>“Black turtle protection, indestructible!”</p><p>shield! Duan gang roared as he circulated his protective Divine Art with all his might. A total of five tortoiseshell-shaped shields completely covered his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard. The black and yellow lights almost flooded the fighting ring. After a while, a figure slid back quickly and coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>It was Duan gang!</p><p>Bu xingkai, on the other hand, stood proudly with a long spear in his hand. Other than his heavy breathing, he was completely fine.</p><p>Bu xingkai had won.</p><p>The crowd sighed, especially the disciples of the Onyx tortoise Hall. Duan gang had been defeated by bu xingkai. It seemed impossible for him to enter the top three.</p><p>bu xingkai is the winner of this round. Alright, the first round is over for today. Take a break. Those who have just unleashed their bloodline power will be given a blood-clotting pill to recover as soon as possible. Then, we’ll proceed to the second round.</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The mystical sword sect was really generous for this competition. They had even taken out blood-clotting pills.</p><p>The blood-clotting pill could restore the power of one’s bloodline for a short period of time after consumption, allowing one’s bloodline to erupt again. It was extremely precious.</p><p>Even the lowest grade that could restore the bloodline of a master realm martial artist was frighteningly expensive and extremely difficult to refine, so it was naturally extremely rare.</p><p>About half an hour later, the second round of the competition began.</p><p>“The first match, Cheng Feicheng versus Zhuo yirong!”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>Among the top ten, there were only two women. He didn’t expect to meet them now.</p><p>Two graceful figures floated up and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Both of them were extremely beautiful and were known as one of the ten beauties of the mystical sword sect. Standing on the same stage, it was like a beautiful scene.</p><p>“Senior Sister desk, please!”</p><p>“Junior Sister Cheng, please!”</p><p>The two of them cupped their fists at each other and started fighting.</p><p>Cheng feichen’s weapon was a sword, and his bloodline was a fire spirit Bird, so her sword technique was of the fire attribute. Sword Qi burst forth, and it was extremely hot.</p><p>Zhuo yirong was using a three-meter long soft whip. With the addition of her plant-type thousand fate vine, they complemented each other well. The soft whip in her hands was ever-changing, dazzling the eyes of the onlookers.</p><p>Two graceful figures even shuttled back and forth on the fighting ring like two dancing butterflies, which was pleasing to the eye.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>In the end, Zhuo yirong still lost because Cheng feimo’s flames were effective against her.</p><p>There was not much change in his ranking on the bronze list.</p><p>The ranking on the bronze ranking list was determined by the elder of the mystical sword sect based on the battle records, the combat strength of the participants, and the battle techniques they were good at.</p><p>It had to be said that it was really accurate.</p><p>“The second match, Duanmu Chen versus Dong CE.”</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle. Dong CE tenaciously resisted more than a dozen moves and was still defeated.</p><p>the third match, Zhang Muyun versus bu xingkai!</p><p>This was the highlight of the show.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, ranked first, versus bu xingkai, ranked third.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was wearing a white robe and had a warm smile on his face.</p><p>However, the moment he attacked, his sword Qi was shocking and his sword light illuminated the 90 States. He was like a sword immortal.</p><p>Although bu xingkai was powerful, he couldn’t last more than ten moves even with all his strength.</p><p>Eight moves, he was defeated in just eight moves.</p><p>And Zhang Muyun didn’t even activate his bloodline.</p><p>Strong, too strong, Zhang Muyun was almost invincible.</p><p>Now, everyone was looking forward to Duanmu Yunyang and Zhang Muyun’s battle. Perhaps only Duanmu Yunyang could compete with Zhang Muyun.</p><p>“The fourth match, Duanmu Yunyang versus Ling Kong!”</p><p>It was another highlight, and the atmosphere was even more lively.</p><p>This was another battle between two new generation Kings from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Ling Kong, do you still want to fight me? You should know that you’re no match for me. ”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang said indifferently as he held his battle blade.</p><p>“Ha ha ha! Duanmu Yunyang, when did you see me surrender without a fight? let’s cut the crap and fight!”</p><p>He laughed loudly in the air. Then, he directly used the Mad beast technique and burst out with his most powerful combat strength as he charged towards Duanmu Yun.</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang said coldly. As soon as he finished speaking, he unsheathed his battle blade.</p><p>As the Battle Sword was unsheathed, the surging blade energy came out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blade energy, more than ten meters long, slashed down from the sky.</p><p>Ling Kong roared like a mad beast. The iron rod brought about a loud rumbling sound as it smashed toward the blade light.</p><p>With a loud bang, the fighting ring shook. Ling Kong’s figure shook slightly, and his attack was blocked.</p><p>However, Duanmu Yunyang’s attacks were like water that had opened the floodgates. They surged and surged towards the sky in an endless stream.</p><p>The domineering blade rays shot out one after another, as if they would never stop.</p><p>Eight moves, just like how Zhang Muyun defeated bu xingkai, he was defeated in eight moves and was cut off the fighting ring.</p><p>that’s amazing. Duanmu Yunyang and Zhang Muyun are far ahead of the top ten. It’s hard for the others to compete with them.</p><p>it’s all up to the two of them. Perhaps they’ll be able to put on an earth-shattering battle.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards discussed excitedly.</p><p>“The fifth round, Lu Ming versus Duan gang!”</p><p>At this moment, the judge announced the fifth match.</p><p>it’s here. The battle between Lu Ming and Duan gang will determine who the top five will be!</p><p>if Lu Ming can defeat Duan gang, he’ll definitely make it into the top five and compete with bu xingkai for the third place to determine who’s the bronze first spear user.</p><p>“That’s right. However, according to my speculation, if Lu Ming only has the combat strength that he had when he fought with Ling Kong, it would be very difficult for him to break Duan gang’s defense unless he has other unique skills!”</p><p>“That’s hard to say. Can’t you see that Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian didn’t erupt?”</p><p>“This … This was really the case! I almost forgot.”</p><p>Amidst the discussions, Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Duan gang stood in front of Lu Ming like an iron tower. At this moment, Duan gang’s expression was a little grave.</p><p>At this point, he no longer dared to underestimate Lu Ming. He knew that he had to fight with all his might. Otherwise, he might very well be defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
