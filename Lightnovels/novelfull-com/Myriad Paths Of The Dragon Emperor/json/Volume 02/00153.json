He’s only at the first grade great Martial Master realm, and even if he comprehended the stellar energy, he’s still no match for me. ”</p><p>BA he’s eyes flashed with a trace of ruthlessness.</p><p>He was also a genius, and he could even cross a realm and kill a third grade great Martial Master. His combat strength was infinitely close to a fourth grade great Martial Master, and he didn’t believe that he wasn’t a match for a first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>The saber slashed out even more fiercely.</p><p>this is a good time to test my current combat strength. Mountain crash!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and swept his long spear from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The saber and spear clashed, creating a deafening roar.</p><p>The terrifying force surged and swept in all directions. One could see that the ground under Lu Ming and BA he’s feet exploded, creating a huge pit with a radius of ten meters and a depth of two meters.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a figure quickly retreated.</p><p>It was BA he!</p><p>He staggered back more than 20 meters, his face full of shock.</p><p>One move. With just one move, he felt that the essential Qi on Lu Ming’s body was like a storm. It was endless, indestructible, and extremely condensed.</p><p>He was cultivating a black grade upper level cultivation technique. The density and density of his essential Qi far exceeded that of yellow grade cultivation techniques. However, compared to Lu Ming’s essential Qi, it was trash. He was completely crushed.</p><p>“How can he be this strong? This kind of strength is already comparable to a fourth grade great master realm.”</p><p>BA he roared in his heart.</p><p>There was a small divide between the third and fourth grade great Martial Master realm, and the difference was huge.</p><p>BA he was shocked, but the people on the city wall were even more shocked. Their mouths were so wide open that a duck’s egg could be stuffed in.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ This young hero Lu Ming? Was he really only sixteen years old? Is he really only a first grade great Martial Master?”</p><p>Fu Liang’s determined old face was filled with shock.</p><p>He had experienced countless life and death battles in his life, but he had never been so shocked.</p><p>“City Lord Fu, Speaking of which, isn’t our Junior Brother Lu Ming a legendary figure in the mystical sword sect? He entered the school last year, and in his first year, he already ranked first on the bronze list.”</p><p>An older Vermillion Bird Hall disciple explained with a proud expression.</p><p>“He joined last year? He’s ranked first on the bronze rank in his first year?”</p><p>Fu Liang repeated, even more shocked.</p><p>At the side, Du Feng and the triangular-eyed young man’s eyes almost popped out. They stared at the city wall and thought that their eyes were playing tricks on them.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Pang Shi grinned.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed lightly and rushed towards BA he.</p><p>“Purgatory blade technique, purgatory on earth!”</p><p>BA he bellowed in rage and exploded with all his strength. Whatever bloodline, potential, all of them exploded and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>The long spear stabbed out like lightning.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>BA he retreated again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After that, the two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves, leaving more than a dozen large pits in the open space.</p><p>BA he was completely at a disadvantage, his face was pale, his body was trembling, and blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“It’s time to end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>He already had a rough idea of his current combat power.</p><p>If he didn’t activate his bloodline, he could probably fight with an ordinary fourth grade great Martial Master. If he activated his bloodline, killing him shouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>At the great Martial Master realm, it was absolutely shocking to be able to cross three levels and kill an opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a flash of blood-red light and his Blood Meridian exploded. Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear turned into a ray of light, and it was much faster than before.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Bach’s heart.</p><p>“I … The small burning sun Empire …”</p><p>BA he’s eyes were wide open in disbelief, then he stopped breathing.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>He pulled out the long spear. The body of the spear shook and blood spurted out. Not a single drop of blood was left on the tip of the spear.</p><p>The devouring power emerged from his palm and BA he’s blood essence was devoured by him. Then, he began to refine it.</p><p>As he was refining, he looked at the Dongyi Army.</p><p>He pointed his spear at the Dongyi Army, and his voice could be heard from afar, ” “Who else wants to fight?”</p><p>“Mighty, mighty!”</p><p>On the city walls, the tens of thousands of soldiers roared, their voices shaking the heavens.</p><p>In the distance, the Dongyi Army was in a panic. Then they turned around and retreated.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe retreated and Lu Ming returned to the city wall.</p><p>“Haha, hero Lu Ming is really a peerless genius. I’ve never seen him before.”</p><p>Fu Liang sighed.</p><p>“Many thanks for the city Lord’s praise, I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly and said,”Let’s organize our men and head to the nine demon mountain!”</p><p>“That’s right. Young heroes, who is willing to go? There are a few soaring eagles in the camp that can take you there quickly.”</p><p>Fu Liang asked.</p><p>“This time, those above the great Martial Master realm will go, and those below the great Martial Master realm will stay here to guard.”</p><p>A fourth grade great master realm expert said.</p><p>Everyone nodded, no one had any objections.</p><p>Very quickly, five gigantic soaring eagles took to the skies from dongque city and headed towards nine demon mountain.</p><p>Most of the mystical sword sect’s one hundred or so great Martial Master disciples had gone. Lu Ming was naturally among them.</p><p>Five fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts were gathered on the largest Soaring Eagle in the middle.</p><p>They were all fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The White Tiger Hall had two while the other three halls had one each.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was one of them.</p><p>After this battle, they had already regarded Lu Ming as a fourth grade Grandmaster.</p><p>The five fourth grade Grandmaster realm cultivators, including Lu Ming, gathered together to discuss.</p><p>“Everyone, I suggest that we should all be United against the external forces. Let’s put aside the grudges between the four great academies for the time being. What do you think?”</p><p>The fourth grade Grandmaster realm expert from the Vermillion Bird Hall, who was about 25 years old, suggested.</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>“I don’t have any either!”</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall and the Onyx tortoise Hall’s fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts nodded.</p><p>The two fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts from The White Tiger Hall glanced at Lu Ming and exchanged a glance. They then nodded and said,”We have no objections either!”</p><p>“I don’t have any either!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded with a smile. He did not mind. If the people from The White Tiger Hall wanted to target him, he would not mind teaching them a painful lesson.</p><p>that’s good. This time, the Dongyi tribe and people who are suspected to be not from the Dongyi tribe are involved in this matter. In my opinion, the nine demons mountain must be up to something. No matter what, we must stop it. The Dongyi tribe has limited Masters. Our strength should be enough.</p><p>Chen Kuan analyzed.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>The soaring Eagle whistled through the air and soon arrived at the destination.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
