Even for a large sect like the mystical sword sect, 41 martial Grandmaster experts was a huge loss.</p><p>Everyone’s faces were unusually serious. No one said a word. After waiting for more than ten minutes and seeing that the Dongyi people didn’t chase after them, Chen Kuan and the others were relieved. They each found a place to heal.</p><p>Lu Ming also flew up to a big tree and circulated the true war Dragon technique. He put all his effort into refining the blood essence that he had just devoured.</p><p>He had devoured the blood essence of two fourth grade great Martial Master realm martial artists in a row. The blood essence of two fourth grade great Martial Master realm martial artists was unimaginably rich in energy, equivalent to the blood essence of 150 first grade great Martial Master realm martial artists.</p><p>Such a huge amount of blood essence was not something that could be refined in a short time.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The spirit-devouring bloodline seemed to be breathing. Every time it breathed, a huge amount of energy would surge into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was increasing rapidly.</p><p>Peak of the middle stage of the first grade great Martial Master realm, late stage of the first grade great Martial Master realm …</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had refined all the blood essence and converted it into his essential Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>This made Lu Ming smile bitterly.</p><p>This was equivalent to the blood essence of 150 first grade great martial masters. In other words, 150 blood essences of the same level as him wouldn’t allow him to break through a level, but only reach the peak of the first grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>The third stage of the true war Dragon technique required far too much energy to raise one’s cultivation base. It was dozens of times more than an ordinary person.</p><p>He really did not know how much energy would be needed to increase his cultivation level after he cultivated to the fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth levels. At the thought of this, Lu Ming could only smile bitterly.</p><p>He shook his head and cast these thoughts aside. It was useless to think so far now.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and jumped down from the big tree.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming.”</p><p>Chen Kuan called out to Lu Ming when he saw him.</p><p>His complexion was better than before. It was obvious that he was much better after some treatment.</p><p>Beside him were the fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts from the other three courtyards.</p><p>The few of them gathered together and seemed to be discussing something.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over.</p><p>“What is this place? I heard the Dongyi people shouting about the relic of their ancestors.”</p><p>Sun RUO, a fourth grade great Martial Master from the Onyx tortoise Hall, said with a frown.</p><p>I’ve read about it in an ancient book. It’s said that at least 10000 years ago, the burning sun Empire was ruled by the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Chen Kuan said after thinking for a while.</p><p>“What? The burning sun Empire was once ruled by the Dongyi tribe?”</p><p>The others were all shocked.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe was only a small tribe in the mountains by the sea. Their population was only a few million. How could they rule the vast territory of the burning sun Empire?</p><p>Chen Kuan thought for a moment. that’s what the ancient records say. It’s said that the Dongyi tribe was very powerful back then. They ruled over not only the burning sun Empire but also several other nearby empires. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>The few of them were very shocked. It was obvious that this was the first time they had heard of such a story.</p><p>unfortunately, they fell apart in the end. After ten thousand years, the Dongyi tribe declined completely and became a small tribe.</p><p>Chen Kuan sighed.</p><p>No matter how powerful a force was, it could not withstand The Invasion of Time and would decline sooner or later.</p><p>“This must be the ruins left behind by the Dongyi tribe.”</p><p>The eyes of a young man from The White Tiger Hall lit up.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>This place was full of mountains, rivers, and forests. It was very likely to be a small plane. It was not difficult to guess that it was probably left behind by the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Since the Dongyi tribe was so powerful, what kind of treasures would be left in the small plane?</p><p>A fortuitous encounter, a fortuitous encounter!</p><p>The few of them roared in their hearts as their eyes flickered.</p><p>my fellow brothers, since the Dongyi tribe has not come after us, we are safe for now. I think we should split up!</p><p>A young man from The White Tiger Hall suggested.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall’s young expert also agreed.</p><p>If everyone acted together, how would they split the opportunities and treasures they encountered?</p><p>Everyone naturally had their own plans.</p><p>“Alright, then it’s decided.”</p><p>In the end, they made up their minds to part ways and look for their own opportunities.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Soon, the disciples of the four halls chose their own directions and disappeared into the forest.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, do you want to join us?”</p><p>Chen Kuan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. it’s alright. I’ll go alone!</p><p>“Then take care, Junior Brother Lu!”</p><p>Chen Kuan cupped his fists and left with a few people.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was the only one left.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. He moved and headed out of the forest. Soon, he was out of the forest. He glanced at the footprints on the ground and went in the direction that the Dongyi tribe had left in.</p><p>Since it was a relic left behind by the ancestors of the Dongyi tribe, they must know a lot about it. Instead of looking around like a headless fly, it was better to follow the Dongyi people and Rob them halfway.</p><p>Lu Ming used the high-air steps and his figure flashed past like a gust of wind, his speed was unparalleled.</p><p>A plane was actually a world, but the laws of heaven and earth in this world were incomplete and imperfect. It had all kinds of flaws, and its area was not very large, so it was called a plane.</p><p>A plane was divided into small, medium, and large planes according to the size of its area.</p><p>Right now, this dimension was only a small dimension.</p><p>However, the small size was only relative to the divine wilderness continent. In fact, this plane was no less than a few thousand miles wide.</p><p>Lu Ming ran for thousands of miles before he finally heard some movement.</p><p>The sounds of battle could be heard from ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop at all. He headed in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Not long after, a dilapidated Palace appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It could be seen that the palace was very large and occupied a large area. However, it had been through too much time and was no longer very dilapidated. Many places had collapsed.</p><p>At this moment, there was an intense battle at the palace’s entrance.</p><p>A dozen Dongyi people were fighting against eight beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the Dongyi people were all martial Grandmaster experts. Two of them were fourth grade and four were third grade Grandmaster.</p><p>However, even with so many experts, they only had a slight advantage against the eight demonic beasts.</p><p>That was because the eight demonic beasts were not normal.</p><p>The eight demonic beasts ‘fur had fallen off, revealing their skinny but metallic muscles.</p><p>Every demonic beast’s eyes were bloodshot. They growled in a low voice and pounced on the Dongyi experts without a care for their lives.</p><p>Sometimes, when the blades of the Dongyi people cut on the bodies of the beasts, they would make metal-clanging sounds.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
