Aren’t you going to show me some respect?”</p><p>As soon as he returned, Feng Wu stared at him with her big eyes.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve made some contributions to collecting information on the geniuses on the bronze list. Don’t I get any reward? ”</p><p>Hua Chi also said with a smile.</p><p>Pang Shi scratched his head. I don’t think that’s a good idea. After all, senior brother Lu Ming won it with his own strength …</p><p>“Idiot, shut up!”</p><p>Feng Wu and Hua Chi spoke in unison, and pang Shi immediately shut his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He then smiled and waved his hand. let’s go to the contribution Hall. Just tell me what you want.</p><p>This time, he was rewarded with one hundred thousand contribution points. In addition to the remaining contribution points from before, Lu Ming had a shocking number of more than one hundred and ten thousand contribution points. Naturally, he was very generous.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you said it yourself. Let’s go.”</p><p>Feng Wu said with a smile, leading the way to the contribution Hall.</p><p>“This isn’t very good!”</p><p>Pang Shi muttered non-stop as Hua Chi dragged him toward the contribution points.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>When they arrived at the contribution Hall, Hua Chi and Feng Wu quickly listed out a bunch of items. It seemed that they had long planned to rip Lu Ming off.</p><p>However, the items they reported weren’t very high-grade, so the prices weren’t very high.</p><p>The beautifying pill and skin nourishing pill that Feng Wu had listed were very low in price, leaving Lu Ming speechless.</p><p>Hua Chi chose some medicinal pills for cultivation and a spirit weapon.</p><p>Pang Shi was left to ponder for a long time, but he was too embarrassed to speak.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately exchanged for some pills that could increase his cultivation. He dragged him to the library and asked him to choose a yellow level upper level martial arts technique.</p><p>He had spent a total of 20000 contribution points.</p><p>Since they were all friends, Lu Ming did not feel any heartache.</p><p>Holding the items she had exchanged for, Feng Wu was smiling so hard that she couldn’t keep her eyes open.</p><p>Hua Chi and pang Shi were also smiling.</p><p>After sending Feng Wu and the other two back, Lu Ming returned to the contribution Hall and began to pick out the items for himself.</p><p>With so many contribution points, it was only natural that they had to be converted into strength.</p><p>First, Lu Ming had to choose a long spear.</p><p>The fire-patterned spear from before was not of much use anymore, especially during the battle with Zhang Muyun. The explosion at the end had caused the spearhead to crack.</p><p>Now, he wanted to choose a spear of higher quality. It had to be at least a third-grade spirit weapon.</p><p>However, there were not many spear-type spirit weapons in the mystical sword sect. After a long time, Lu Ming only picked one.</p><p>The fiery Tung spear was a spiritual weapon of lower Lv 3.</p><p>The spear body was eight feet long and made of fiery Tung iron, which had excellent flexibility and toughness.</p><p>The tip of the spear was eight inches long and made of runic gold steel. It was extremely hard.</p><p>The long spear weighed 3600 catties. Lu Ming held it in his hands and shook it gently.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The long spear swayed and pierced through the air, emitting a whistling sound.</p><p>Such a heavy long spear could blow a person apart with a casual sweep.</p><p>Lu Ming was quite satisfied. At least it was much stronger than the fire pattern gun.</p><p>Just this spear alone cost him 10000 contribution points.</p><p>Lu Ming then exchanged for a thousand-year-old blood ginseng and a section of the red-horned Tiger’s horn. He spent a total of 50000 contribution points on these two items.</p><p>This was because these two items were the materials required to cultivate the third level of the true war Dragon technique. They were extremely precious and their prices were astonishingly high.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already overjoyed that he could exchange for it.</p><p>This was because he had now gathered all four of the main ingredients required to cultivate the third stage of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Dark Bloodstone, flame crystal grass, thousand-year blood ginseng, red-horned Tiger’s horn.</p><p>Then, he exchanged for the remaining supplementary materials and ten portions of Class 9 second level demonic beast blood essence. Lu Ming immediately became a pauper again. He was only left with a few hundred contribution points.</p><p>If others were to find out about this rate of spending, they would probably be scared to death.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care at all. After returning to the dormitory and entering the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming could not wait to open the ” high-altitude steps ” and started to watch it.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming closed the secret manual and began to comprehend it.</p><p>The chanting of Sutras could be heard from the highest point of the Supreme shrine. Lu Ming’s mind was extremely clear, and his understanding of the soaring steps was slowly deepening.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming moved. His body was as light as a feather as he flickered on the platform.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>“A black grade high level martial arts technique is indeed difficult to cultivate. Previously, I still had the soaring cloud steps as a Foundation, but if I want to cultivate it to the first stage, I will still need some time.”</p><p>Black grade high level martial arts techniques were extremely difficult to cultivate. According to common sense, only high level great martial masters were qualified to cultivate them.</p><p>Correspondingly, it was also very powerful.</p><p>As long as one cultivated the first stage, its power would far exceed the sixth stage of the yellow rank upper grade movement technique “soaring cloud steps.”</p><p>As long as it was cultivated to the third level, its power would be comparable to the sixth level of a black grade low level martial arts technique.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming began to cultivate again.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming mainly cultivated the ‘high-air steps’ and the ‘fire controlling gun technique’. He spent the rest of his time devouring demonic beasts’ blood essence to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>The competition between the silver disciples in the great competition of the four courtyards had also ended.</p><p>The battles on the silver list were completely different from those on the bronze list.</p><p>On the silver ranking, Duanmu Lin had an absolute advantage. He had swept away all his opponents and was ranked first.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was known as one of the four geniuses of the mystical sword sect. He was so powerful that no one could compare to him because the other three geniuses were all disciples of the Qilin Hall.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was the only one who was ranked among the four great geniuses.</p><p>Of course, the gold disciples here were not included.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he continued to cultivate.</p><p>Ten days later, Lu Ming finally succeeded in cultivating the air walk. He had entered the first level and had a basic understanding of it.</p><p>The ten portions of demonic beast blood essence were also completely devoured. However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation was at ninth grade master realm. Devouring ninth grade second level demonic beast blood essence would increase his cultivation very slowly. The ten portions of demonic beast blood essence had only increased Lu Ming’s cultivation by a small step, not even reaching the peak of the early ninth grade master realm.</p><p>cultivation can’t be rushed, especially after reaching the ninth grade master realm. You need to accumulate. For example, Zhang Muyun and the others have been stuck at this realm for a few years.</p><p>“Now, I’ll begin cultivating the third stage of the true war Dragon technique.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then took out the dark Bloodstone and other materials.</p><p>According to the true war Dragon technique’s record, after it was done, he swallowed it in one gulp and began to break through to the third stage of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>At the third stage of the true war Dragon technique, the density and density of his essential Qi was four times that of ordinary essential Qi. As long as he could break through, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase by a large margin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body seemed to be about to explode. The power was shocking.</p><p>One could vaguely hear roars coming out.</p><p>Half a day later, the sound disappeared and everything calmed down. Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“Is this the third stage of the true war Dragon technique? It is indeed powerful!”</p><p>A glint of joy flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes as he felt the rich and condensed essential Qi in his body.</p><p>If he were to fight Zhang Muyun again, he was confident that he could defeat him without using his bloodline.</p><p>It wasn’t just one move, it was a complete victory.</p><p>now I can go to the mountain range by the sea to cultivate. I can practice my martial skills and kill demonic beasts to improve my cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind. He packed his things and headed to the mountain range by the sea.</p><p>The last time Lu Ming went to the coastal mountain range to practice his spear Arts, he had only gone two hundred miles deep and there were not many powerful demonic beasts.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming decided to go deeper.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming was five hundred miles into the mountain range by the sea.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
