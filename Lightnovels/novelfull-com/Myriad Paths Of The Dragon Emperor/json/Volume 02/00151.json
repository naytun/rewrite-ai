They only felt that he was unfathomable.</p><p>Fu Liang frowned. After a while, he said,”If I’m not wrong, he has already reached the peak of the second grade great master realm.”</p><p>“What? A peak second grade great master?”</p><p>Gasps were heard once again.</p><p>To be able to reach the peak of the second grade great Martial Master realm at the age of nineteen, he was far stronger than anyone had imagined. In the mystical sword sect, such a cultivation was already considered to be at the peak.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, Duanmu Yunyang, and the others were already 18 years old when the great competition of the four courtyards took place. This could be considered as the reason why they had deliberately stopped to accumulate their strength.</p><p>BA he’s cultivation speed alone was not much slower than Zhang Muyun and the others.</p><p>However, Zhang Muyun and the others were the top geniuses of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Damn it, the top genius of the mystical sword sect isn’t here today. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have the right to be so arrogant.”</p><p>“Yeah, we were caught off guard.”</p><p>Although some people looked at Lu Ming, they shook their heads.</p><p>Lu Ming was still in the master realm some time ago. Even if he had broken through to the Grandmaster realm now, he had just broken through. He was most likely not a match for the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. Just as he was about to make a move, BA he spoke.</p><p>“What’s wrong? No one else? The mystical sword sect is nothing more than this. How about this, I’ll raise the age by two years. Anyone below the age of 22 can come and fight me. ”</p><p>BA he laughed, full of contempt.</p><p>alright, twenty-two years old. That’s what you said.</p><p>The young man who was over 20 years old shouted and jumped down, rushing toward the other party.</p><p>haha, senior brother Lu Tian has made his move. This time, the other party is dead for sure.</p><p>he’s overconfident. He actually raised his age by two years. Senior brother Lu Tian just so happens to be 22 years old, and his cultivation has already reached the third grade great Martial Master realm. He’s more than enough to crush him. Moreover, senior brother Lu Tian was once on the bronze ranking.</p><p>the other party is courting death. He killed two of our people in a row and is already cocky.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect all smiled.</p><p>However, Lu Ming frowned. He did not know why but he felt that it was not that simple.</p><p>Lu Tian quickly arrived in front of BA he.</p><p>you’re just a mere barbarian. You’ve killed two of my mystical sword sect’s disciples. You deserve to die. I’ll send you on your way now.</p><p>Lu Tian’s eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>BA he smiled faintly and said in a disdainful tone: ” the two people before me said the same thing. But they couldn’t even block one of my blades.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to them!”</p><p>die! Lu Tian shouted coldly, and his aura burst forth. His third grade great Martial Master aura formed a powerful pressure that crushed toward his opponent.</p><p>However, BA he just smiled faintly, with a trace of ridicule on the corner of his mouth, as if there was no pressure at all.</p><p>“Headwind triple slash!”</p><p>Lu Tian suddenly shouted as he unsheathed his battle saber. A terrifying Saber Light soared into the sky, forming a battle saber that was dozens of meters long. It slashed towards BA he.</p><p>“Good, black grade low level martial arts technique’s fourth stage!”</p><p>Fu Liang cheered loudly and thought to himself,’as expected of a genius from the mystical sword sect. A third grade great Martial Master can cultivate a black grade low level martial arts technique to the fourth stage.’</p><p>An ordinary martial artist, at the third grade great Martial Master realm, might not even be able to cultivate a black grade low level martial arts technique!</p><p>Even he, who had bitterly cultivated a black grade low level martial arts technique for several decades, was only at the fourth stage.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>BA he smiled slightly, and the blade was unsheathed again.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The saber Light tore through the air and slashed toward Lu Tian’s head.</p><p>“This move is useless Against Me!”</p><p>Lu Tian let out a long howl. His true Qi burst forth, forming two battle sabers in front of him. He then slashed forward.</p><p>Bang Bang!</p><p>The battle saber condensed from true Qi was shattered, but Lu Tian managed to buy himself some time. The battle saber in his hand cut through the air and slashed at his opponent’s head.</p><p>BA he stomped his feet and his figure retreated dozens of meters.</p><p>“Good! Senior brother Lu Tian is mighty!”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect shouted.</p><p>They were naturally excited that a mystical sword sect disciple had finally gained the upper hand.</p><p>haha, it seems like you have some ability, unlike those trash just now. In that case, I’ll be more serious too.</p><p>BA he suddenly laughed.</p><p>be more serious and arrogant. You’re clearly at a disadvantage, but you want to save your face.</p><p>“Hmph, I was just too full of myself earlier.”</p><p>senior brother Lu Tian, kill him. Let these eastern barbarians see the power of our mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Tian couldn’t smile at all. This was because the moment BA he spoke seriously, he felt a powerful and sinister aura enveloping him. As soon as he was enveloped by this aura, Lu Tian felt his entire body turn cold, a chill rising from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“To be able to force me to use my true abilities, you can die without regrets.”</p><p>BA he licked his lips, and a blood-red light flashed in his eyes. Then, a thick black true energy emerged from his body.</p><p>“Purgatory blade technique!”</p><p>BA he shouted loudly and slashed out with his blade. At this moment, the wind and clouds gathered and the black true Qi on his body gathered together with the blade light, vaguely forming an evil ghost.</p><p>It was as if an evil ghost had slashed out with a blade.</p><p>you … Lu Tian was shocked. With an angry roar, he activated his bloodline and used his strongest combat strength.</p><p>“Meteor destruction!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two blade lights met in the air, and with a loud bang, the blade light shot out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A figure retreated quickly. It was Lu Tian.</p><p>His face was pale and he coughed up a large amount of blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock. After he retreated, he turned around and ran. He didn’t dare to fight.</p><p>“It’s too late for you to leave.”</p><p>A cold voice rang out, and a black Saber Light streaked across the void, slashing toward Lu Tian.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Lu Tian shouted, but it was to no avail.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>His head fell to the ground, and blood splattered.</p><p>Lu Tian, a third grade great Martial Master and once on the bronze ranking, had been killed by someone with a lower cultivation base, and by a small clan like the Dongyi.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect found it hard to accept this fact.</p><p>How could the Dongyi tribe have such a powerful genius?</p><p>This wasn’t a simple battle of surpassing one’s level. One had to know that Lu Tian himself was a genius, an expert of the same level, not an ordinary third grade great Martial Master.</p><p>But he was killed by the other party.</p><p>the opponent’s cultivation method is very special. It doesn’t seem to be the cultivation method of the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Fu Liang suddenly said.</p><p>“Are you saying that he is not from the Dongyi tribe?”</p><p>A mystical sword sect disciple asked.</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe the Dongyi people have had some fortuitous encounter.</p><p>Fu Liang said.</p><p>haha, what genius? they’re all trash. Is there anyone else who wants to fight me? ”</p><p>BA he’s entire body was filled with black Zhen Qi, his eyes were like lightning, and his aura was like a rainbow.</p><p>No one made a sound.</p><p>“At first, I thought that the mystical sword sect would have some amazing genius. That was why he set the age limit. Now, it seemed that there was no need for that. A little blazing sun Emperor … No, the mystical sword sect doesn’t have any geniuses.”</p><p>BA he said disdainfully.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
