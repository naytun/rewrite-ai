He continued to bombard the Halo that enveloped the secret manual.</p><p>I don’t care who he is. To think that these secret manuals are protected by inscriptions. Given that so many years have passed, the power of the inscriptions still hasn’t dissipated yet. I’ll think about it later! zhang xuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind raced. In a flash, he flew to another stone pillar and thrust his long spear at lightning speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the long spear stabbed into the Halos covering the secret manual, it caused a boom while the Halos started to shake like water waves.</p><p>However, it did not shatter.</p><p>“What a powerful inscription defense. I don’t know how many years have passed, but it still has such a strong defense?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>the scroll, it’s a scroll left by the ancestors of my Dongyi people! Stop!</p><p>damn it! How dare you touch the secret manual of the Dongyi tribe! You’re looking for death!</p><p>At this moment, two elders from the Dongyi tribe came in. They roared in anger when they saw what was happening.</p><p>Then the two elders of the Dongyi tribe pounced on the skinny black-robed man.</p><p>Two snow-white blade lights cut through the air and slashed at the thin black-robed man.</p><p>you guys are really ungrateful. I guided you guys here, and you guys actually attacked me first? ”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man abandoned the manual and dodged the attack.</p><p>“Hmph, if you didn’t play tricks, how could the little b * stard from the mystical sword sect have entered? Then all the treasures here will be ours. It won’t be too late to kill him after I’ve dealt with you!”</p><p>The slimmer old man said coldly.</p><p>“Ridiculous, do you really think you can kill me?”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man said in a hoarse voice. At the same time, his aura grew stronger. A black sword appeared in his hand. He swung the sword, sending out sharp sword Qi toward the two elders.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The three of them exchanged a few blows. The skinny black-robed man was at a disadvantage and he quickly retreated.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was frantically attacking a light circle. After dozens of consecutive shots, the light circle finally exploded with a bang, like a ball of fireworks.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the secret manual.</p><p>The secret manual was very soft and was neither gold nor Jade. He did not have time to look at it carefully. With a thought, he kept the secret manual in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, he pounced on another stone pillar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. The thin black-robed man actually ran towards Lu Ming, with the two elders of the Dongyi tribe chasing after him.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but curse. The skinny black-robed man was obviously diverting the trouble to himself.</p><p>“Little brother, why don’t we join forces and kill these two old men? we’ll split the items here equally. What do you think?”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man called out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. sure! he said. we’ll take one each!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming rushed toward the old man.</p><p>He would have to deal with the two elders sooner or later. Otherwise, the other party would not let him go. He might as well join hands with the skinny black-robed man and deal with the two elders first.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man was overjoyed. He turned around and charged at the fat old man.</p><p>“Damn it, do you think that joining hands will be of any use?”</p><p>The skinny elder roared and slashed his saber at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled. The Spear’s gleam pierced through the air and he was engaged in a great battle with his opponent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the stone chamber, there were loud rumbles. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged more than twenty moves with his opponent.</p><p>Lu Ming became stronger as he fought and gradually suppressed his opponent.</p><p>On the other side, the skinny man with the black plate also displayed his powerful combat strength, suppressing the fat elder to the point where he could not fight back.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s retreat!”</p><p>The two elders of the Dongyi tribe roared in their hearts, but they had already decided to retreat.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now.”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man shouted coldly and waved his hands. A black light flashed rapidly and the air was filled with a ‘Chi Chi’ sound.</p><p>The fat old man’s expression changed drastically, and he waved his saber rapidly, making a series of “ding ding ding” sounds.</p><p>However, they did not know what the sound was. It was too dense and fast, and it was difficult to completely block it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the end, the fat old man’s body was hit by something, and a long wound was cut open.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The skinny black-robed man continued to wave his hands, and the air-piercing sounds became more intense.</p><p>The fat old man roared repeatedly, but it was useless.</p><p>With a pfft sound, blood splattered everywhere. The fat old man’s throat was pierced through, and he fell down screaming.</p><p>The thin elder was shocked and did not dare to continue fighting. He slashed a few times in an attempt to force Lu Ming to retreat and escape.</p><p>“You’re underestimating me too much. I’ll send you to accompany your companions!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and thrust his long spear rapidly.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; a terrifying energy exploded from the tip of the spear and shot toward elder Xi.</p><p>The old man’s body trembled violently and he coughed out a large mouthful of blood. He was almost blown apart.</p><p>However, he was greeted by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The fiery-red spear pierced through the old man’s chest.</p><p>The old man was dead!</p><p>The two Eastern Barbarian elders were both killed.</p><p>amazing, amazing. Little brother is so young, but your strength is so terrifying. I really admire you.</p><p>The skinny black-robed man laughed in a hoarse and low voice as he slowly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his spear and controlled his blood vessels to silently devour the elder’s blood essence.</p><p>Instantly, the blood essence of a fifth grade Grandmaster martial artist began to be refined. It turned into waves of energy that surged into Lu Ming’s body to replenish his true Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be panting heavily and said, ” you are the mysterious one. You actually led the Dongyi tribe to find their ancestral relic. It seems that you were the one who instigated the Dongyi tribe to attack the burning sun Empire? ”</p><p>haha, that’s because we have no choice. We have to use the Dongyi tribe to open their ancestral relic. Now, we’ve solved everything. It’s just you and me. We’ll split the treasures equally. What do you think? ”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man laughed in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>At this moment, the thin black-robed man suddenly launched an attack. He pounced at Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning and waved his hands, causing the air to crack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was very calm, as if he had expected the skinny black-robed man’s sneak attack. The moment the skinny black-robed man attacked, Lu Ming’s body floated backward. He waved his long spear, and the tip of the spear trembled, turning into rays of spear light.</p><p>Ding ding!</p><p>A series of concentrated clashing sounds rang out. The skinny black-robed man’s attacks were all blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You knew I was going to ambush you?”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man seemed to be surprised.</p><p>“One must always be on guard against others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You’re quite young, but you’re quite vigilant. But do you think you can stop me just because you’re on guard? You’re so naive!”</p><p>In the next moment, the thin black-robed man disappeared and suddenly appeared behind Lu Ming, stabbing his sword at Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming swept his long spear to the back.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear and the sword clashed. Lu Ming’s body trembled, but he stomped on the ground and continued to attack the skinny black-robed man.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and launched a storm-like attack.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
