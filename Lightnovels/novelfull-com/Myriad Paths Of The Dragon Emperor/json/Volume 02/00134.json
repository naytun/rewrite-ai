He then looked at Jian wuchen and said, ” “Can’t you see that Qiu Yue cares a lot about me? you’re scolding me like this in front of the person she cares about. If you’re not an idiot, then what are you?”</p><p>“Bastard, let go of your dog paws!”</p><p>Jian wuchen’s eyes turned red when he saw Lu Ming holding Qiu Yue’s hand.</p><p>From the first time he saw Qiu Yue, he had already made her his woman. Now, Lu Ming actually dared to hold Qiu Yue’s hand. Even he had never touched Qiu Yue’s hand. How dare this b * stard? How was he worthy?</p><p>The fire of jealousy in his heart was about to burn the nine Heavens.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a step forward and closed in on Lu Ming in an instant. He swung his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was only a palm, but it gave off the feeling of a peerless divine sword being unsheathed.</p><p>“Jian wuchen, what are you doing?”</p><p>Qiu Yue was shocked and wanted to stand in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch.</p><p>His fist and Jian wuchen’s palm collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, the force spread in all directions. The mountain under Lu Ming and Jian wuchen’s feet seemed to have been plowed, and deep ravines appeared.</p><p>With a slight sway, the two of them each took two steps back.</p><p>“Jian wuchen, stop!”</p><p>Qiu Yue stood in front of Lu Ming and glared at Jian wuchen.</p><p>Seeing Qiu Yue’s expression, Jian wuchen stopped. However, his expression turned even uglier. He stared at Lu Ming and said, you little bastard, you’re actually capable enough to receive 30% of my power. It seems that you’re on the so-called bronze list of the four great courtyards, right? ”</p><p>“You’re not bad to be able to force me to use 20% of my power!” Lu Ming smiled indifferently.</p><p>“20% of my power? Hahaha, you’re really good at talking without thinking, aren’t you afraid of people laughing at you?”</p><p>Jian wuchen laughed with a mocking expression.</p><p>The other young men also showed a mocking smile.</p><p>Lu Ming said that he had only used 20% of his strength? Who would believe that?</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and could not be bothered to explain.</p><p>“Since you said you only used 20% of your power, then I’d like to see how strong you are at 100%.”</p><p>Jian wuchen sneered. With a sword cry, an ancient combat sword appeared above his head.</p><p>This combat sword looked like it was full of the marks of time. It was very ancient, as if it had been passed down from ancient times.</p><p>It was Jian wuchen’s bloodline.</p><p>Weapon-type bloodlines were all special bloodlines that were extremely mysterious and difficult to fathom.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. This was the first time he had seen a special bloodline.</p><p>As soon as the sword-shaped bloodline appeared, Jian wuchen’s body was surrounded by sharp sword Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. What did he have to fear with a special bloodline?</p><p>He could tell that Jian wuchen was also a peak ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to unleash his cultivation to fight Jian wuchen, Qiu Yue shouted angrily, ” Jian wuchen, if you dare to attack me today, you and I will be mortal enemies from now on!</p><p>Qiu Yue’s words were firm and unquestionable.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Jian wuchen was furious, but he couldn’t do anything. The sword-shaped bloodline disappeared, and his aura weakened.</p><p>“Young master, let’s go!”</p><p>Qiu Yue grabbed Lu Ming’s hand and dragged him outside.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and allowed Qiu Yue to pull him forward, disappearing from the scene.</p><p>senior brother Jian, a mere piece of trash from the four great academies dares to talk back to you and be so close to Junior Sister Qiuyue. He really deserves to die!</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s eyes burned with jealousy and killing intent as he looked in the direction where Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had disappeared.</p><p>that kid can take a strike with thirty percent of senior brother Jian’s strength. He must be on the so-called bronze ranking. Hehe, if our Qilin Hall doesn’t come out, these people on the bronze ranking will really think that they are geniuses. What a joke.</p><p>A young man in a blue robe laughed.</p><p>“It’s time for our Qilin Hall to go out for a walk. Otherwise, the other four halls will forget about us and look down on us.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said coldly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The next moment, he turned into a sword light and dashed toward the class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast.</p><p>The demonic beast was directly cut in half, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>……</p><p>Qiu Yue pulled Lu Ming along and walked for a few miles before stopping.</p><p>young master, although Jian wuchen is detestable and annoying, his talent is terrifyingly high. His combat strength is extremely powerful. It’s not suitable for you to fight him now.</p><p>Qiu Yue explained to Lu Ming, afraid that he would feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and reached out to scratch the tip of Qiu Yue’s nose.”If you didn’t pull me away, I would have beaten him to the ground.”</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her eyes and blushed. She didn’t take it seriously and said, ” “Young master, this … During this period of time, Qiuyue missed you very much. You … Did you …”</p><p>At this point, Qiu Yue’s face turned red and she lowered her head shyly. She could not continue.</p><p>“Our Qiu Yue is so beautiful, how can young master not miss you? I’ve been thinking about you all this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming leaned over and whispered into Qiu Yue’s ear.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face turned even redder, and even her neck was completely red. “Really … Really?”</p><p>of course it’s true. When has young master ever lied to you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a serious look.</p><p>A happy smile appeared on Qiu Yue’s face, but the next moment, a worried expression appeared on her face. it’s a pity that master doesn’t allow me to go out for now. Unless I’m a fourth grade great Martial Master or above, Qiu Yue can stay by young master’s side.</p><p>“Eh? Qiuyue, have you awakened your bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, feeling curious.</p><p>“It’s awakened! Young master, look!”</p><p>As she said that, a blood-red light flashed on Qiu Yue’s back and a snow-white ball of air appeared. At the same time, a cold air filled the air. Even with Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he felt cold all over.</p><p>What shocked Lu Ming even more was the eight blood-red chakra on the snow-white mass.</p><p>Eight Meridian cycles, level eight Blood Meridian. Lu Ming was shocked beyond words.</p><p>The next moment, Qiu Yue retracted her bloodline, and the temperature of the arena rose again.</p><p>“Qiuyue, could this be the ice bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yup!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded.</p><p>“It’s indeed the ice bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he was overjoyed.</p><p>There were several types of special bloodlines.</p><p>The most common bloodlines were weapon-type bloodlines, and there was also a natural-type bloodline.</p><p>For example, ice, fire, wind, blood, lightning, and so on.</p><p>This type of bloodline was born from nature and was naturally compatible with these elements. It was extremely wondrous and powerful.</p><p>Cultivating related martial skills and even understanding their corresponding aura gave him a unique advantage.</p><p>However, natural-type bloodlines were too rare. There was only one in a billion people.</p><p>Furthermore, the grade of his bloodline was as high as rank 8, which made it even rarer.</p><p>One had to know that even though Duanmu Lin was known as a peerless genius, his bloodline was only at rank 7.</p><p>Most of the mystical sword sect’s newcomer kings only had sixth level bloodlines.</p><p>It was no wonder that Qiu Yue’s master wanted her to reach the fourth grade great Martial Master realm before letting her go out and explore.</p><p>If the other sects were to find out about his talent, they would most likely send people to assassinate him.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
