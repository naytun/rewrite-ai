Are you going to attack the juniors?”</p><p>Yan LAN glared at Duanmu pojun.</p><p>“Principal!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted.</p><p>Yan LAN looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed to Yan LAN, ” “Thank you for your help, Dean!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked at Mu Lan and the rest.”Senior Sister Mu Lan, Boulder, fengwu, you don’t have to say anything. I already understand this.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently.</p><p>The sect leader’s meaning was already very clear.</p><p>What he meant next was that he would definitely be expelled from the sect.</p><p>“It’s still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>Strength. It was all a matter of strength.</p><p>He was too weak. If he was so strong that he could surpass the Duanmu family, why would the sect leader of the mystical sword sect have such intentions? Why would he be punished?</p><p>Even if the Duanmu family was destroyed, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect would not say a word.</p><p>Even though he had displayed unparalleled talent during this period of time.</p><p>However, that was only for now. He was still young after all. Who knew what would happen in the future? Would it be like a shooting star, flashing and disappearing?</p><p>There were too many such examples in the world.</p><p>Moreover, Duanmu Lin was also a peerless genius. He had awakened a second rank King bloodline and had broken through to the martial ancestor realm at the age of 18. He could expect to become a martial King in the future.</p><p>In many people’s eyes, Duanmu Lin’s future would definitely be stronger than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>All in all, Lu Ming’s value and weight paled in comparison to the Duanmu family. That was why the sect leader had chosen the Duanmu family in the end.</p><p>This was the reality.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart, then smiled faintly. He looked at the sect leader of the mystical sword sect and said in a clear voice, ” “Sect leader Lin, today, I, Lu Ming, will leave the mystical sword sect!”</p><p>The voice was calm and indifferent, causing everyone’s heart to tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to withdraw from the mystical sword sect!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t!”</p><p>Mu Lan shouted.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pang Shi gritted his teeth, his eyes wide open.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun, Duan gang, and the others sighed.</p><p>Many of the Duanmu family’s disciples laughed.</p><p>Duanmu canghai and Duanmu pojun’s faces revealed a cold smile.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, big rock, you don’t have to say anything. I’ve made up my mind!”</p><p>Rather than waiting to be expelled from the sect, it would be better to withdraw himself.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>The sect leader Lin Xueyi let out a long sigh and said, ” “Lu Ming, I, Lin Xue, guarantee that no one will dare to touch your family again. I will guarantee their safety for ten years.”</p><p>“Elder Yue!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted.</p><p>“This old man is here!”</p><p>Behind Lin Xueyi, a gold-robed elder cupped his fists and said.</p><p>set off immediately and guard the Lu family of fiery wind city for ten years. Ensure the Lu family’s safety for ten years. Kill anyone who dares to touch the Lu family!</p><p>Lin Xueyi ordered.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The Golden-robed elder cupped his fists and turned into a stream of light, disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Duanmu canghai’s old eyes squinted and a glint flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Duanmu pojun’s expression was somewhat unsightly.</p><p>It was obvious that Xue Lin’s actions were to guard against the Duanmu family.</p><p>“Thank you, sect leader Lin!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and cupped his fists to express his gratitude.</p><p>He was thanking her from the bottom of his heart. He had been worried about the Lu family and his mother, but now there was no need to.</p><p>With a gold-robed elder guarding the place, the Lu family would be safe for the next ten years.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve let you down. As the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, I have to think for the sake of the mystical sword sect!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi sighed and it rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Of course, it was a voice transmission, so no one else could hear it.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and did not say much.</p><p>Then, it flew towards Yan LAN.</p><p>“Dean, Lu Ming thanks you for your help.” He bowed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to do this. Even if I have to risk my life, I can still protect you.”</p><p>Yan LAN said.</p><p>“Lu Ming will always remember the Dean’s kindness.”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted again and moved to Mu Lan’s side.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>…</p><p>Mu Lan and the others called out one by one. Their eyes were filled with anger and reluctance.</p><p>“Everyone, please take care of yourself in the future. I will come back to see you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, since you’re leaving the sect, I’ll leave with you. I’m not staying here any longer.”</p><p>Pang Shi roared.</p><p>big rock, what are you talking about? just focus on your cultivation in the mystical sword sect. With your talent, you’ll definitely be successful in the future. Don’t let your parents down.</p><p>Lu Ming said, feeling very warm in his heart.</p><p>In the mystical sword sect, the best thing he had gained was making a few true friends.</p><p>“But, but Yan!”</p><p>Pang Shi’s eyes were bloodshot, and his fists were clenched so tightly that they made cracking sounds.</p><p>“But what? Cultivate well, we’ll definitely meet again in the future and have a drink together.”</p><p>Lu Ming patted pang Shi’s shoulder and said sternly.</p><p>Pang Shi gritted his teeth, then nodded solemnly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful when you leave the mystical sword sect. The Duanmu family will not let you off so easily.”</p><p>Mu Lan warned. Her eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was very clear about this.</p><p>He and the Duanmu family had long been at each other’s throats.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming smiled and whispered into Mu Lan’s ear, ” “Senior Sister Mu Lan, don’t forget that you still owe me a reward. I’ll be asking for it the next time we meet.”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he even sniffed it heavily.</p><p>“As long as you’re alive, everything can be discussed!” Mu Lan’s face reddened.</p><p>Everything can be discussed?</p><p>Was he hinting at something? Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Then, he smiled and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun strode out and cupped his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care!”</p><p>After that, Ling Kong, Duan gang, Zhuo yirong, Cheng Feicheng, and the rest walked out and cupped their fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, everyone, take care! Let’s have a drink together next time!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“There’s still a next time when we drink? Lu Ming, I will kill you!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s eyes were cold and his voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Duanmu Lin with a cold smile.”Duanmu Lin, do you really think you’re a genius? I, Lu Ming, swear today that I will take your head with my own strength within two years.”</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. With your own strength? You won’t be my match for the rest of your life!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin sneered. His smile was full of disdain.</p><p>“Also, we’ll see if you’re still alive!”</p><p>“Lin ‘er, he’s just talking for fun. He’s forcefully fused with the Demon King’s soul and will soon become a cripple. He’s already at the end of his road.”</p><p>Duanmu pojun sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? Just you wait, old man. I’ve killed dozens of people from your Duanmu family today, but I’ll definitely use my spear to wipe out the Duanmu family in the future.”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming leaped forward and laughed. Step by step, he walked in the air and headed out of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Under the sunlight, Lu Ming’s young back was filled with confidence, determination, unyielding, and a heroic spirit as if he had vowed to break through the heavens.</p><p>This scene, this moment, this back view, was deeply imprinted in the minds of everyone present.</p><p>He would never forget it for the next ten, twenty, or even his entire life.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
