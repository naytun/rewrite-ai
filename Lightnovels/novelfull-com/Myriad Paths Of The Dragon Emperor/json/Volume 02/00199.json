However, he was like a little chick in Lu Ming’s hands. He could not put up any resistance.</p><p>Silence! At this moment, the air between heaven and earth seemed to have frozen. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Even after knowing Hua Jie’s identity, Lu Ming was still so bold that he dared to hold Hua Jie’s throat.</p><p>Even the elites of the five sects didn’t have the guts to do so.</p><p>This was because this was the imperial capital after all, the imperial family’s genius.</p><p>“Let go of the young prince!”</p><p>The six burly men rushed over, not caring about their injuries.</p><p>“If you don’t want him to die, then go ahead and attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The six burly men immediately stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared in front of the armor-breaking beast.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast seemed to be very afraid of Lu Ming as it slowly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his finger and a ray of spear light pierced through the scales on the armor-breaking beast’s body, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast was injured and let out an angry roar. Its eyes were red and it was filled with a murderous aura.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sent Hua Jie to the mouth of the armor-breaking beast.</p><p>However, the armor-breaking beast looked at Hua Jie hesitantly. It seemed to be afraid of Hua Jie.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and cut Hua Jie’s arm with his hand. A stream of blood flew into the armor-breaking beast’s mouth.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast went crazy after being injured and now, with blood in its mouth, it opened its mouth and roared. It was filled with bloodlust and its eyes were filled with greed as it stared at Hua Jie.</p><p>“No, don’t!”</p><p>Hua Jie screamed desperately. He was almost scared out of his wits, and his whole body was trembling.</p><p>I believe many people have been eaten by your demonic beasts. Now, your armor-breaking beast has eaten you. You deserve it!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings was extremely shocked as they looked at this scene with their mouths agape.</p><p>Lu Ming was too bold. He actually wanted the armor-breaking beast to devour Hua Jie.</p><p>There were also many people who were cheering in their hearts. Hua Jie had used his status to commit all sorts of evil in the Imperial City. It could be said that he had angered the heavens and resented the people, but no one dared to say anything.</p><p>This was because his father was the Heavenly King of suppression.</p><p>It was known as heaven suppressing, so one could imagine how powerful it was.</p><p>Most importantly, the Heavenly King and the ten direction Sword School had a very close relationship.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast roared and pounced forward, biting at Hua Jie.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>The six middle-aged men roared.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Hua Jie let out an extremely miserable shriek. He was extremely resentful and miserable.</p><p>After that, a foul stench came out. Hua Jie was so scared that he peed his pants.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and took a step back. The armor-breaking beast missed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Hua Jie continued to scream. After a while, he realized that everything was fine and stopped.</p><p>Then, he realized that the people around him were looking at him strangely. Their faces were all red, and they obviously wanted to laugh but didn’t dare to.</p><p>At the same time, a foul smell entered Hua Jie’s nose. In an instant, his face changed from pale to green, and then to red.</p><p>At this moment, he wished he could find a hole in the ground to hide in.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Hua Jie roared in his heart.</p><p>“A young prince who would let a demonic beast eat others for no reason. It turns out that he only has this much courage. He was so scared that he peed his pants. Today, I’ve learned something new, hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming casually threw Hua Jie aside. He did not even look at Hua Jie and left laughing.</p><p>In fact, he had no intention of killing Hua Jie from the very beginning.</p><p>The main reason he came to the Imperial City was to investigate his father. If he killed Hua Jie, the Heavenly King would definitely go crazy, and it would be difficult for him to stay in the Imperial City.</p><p>Now, he was only teaching Hua Jie a lesson. The enmity he had created was only between Hua Jie and the younger generation. The Heavenly King was too embarrassed to interfere.</p><p>At least on the surface, she was embarrassed.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of the younger generation.</p><p>“Damn it, I swear I’ll kill you no matter who you are!”</p><p>Hua Jie was roaring in his heart but he did not dare to voice it out for fear that Lu Ming would come back.</p><p>“Whoever dares to spread the word about what happened today, I will kill his entire family!”</p><p>After Lu Ming had gone far away, Hua Jie looked at the crowd around him and shouted angrily.</p><p>The crowd was disdainful. This Hua Jie was really a bully. He peed his pants in front of Lu Ming. After Lu Ming left, he started to show off his might again. However, they were not as bold as Lu Ming and could only nod their heads.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Hua Jie called out and left in a hurry.</p><p>He needed to find a place to change his pants.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look for a restaurant in this area. He planned to walk further and find a place to rest.</p><p>“Brother, please wait!”</p><p>After walking for a while, he suddenly heard a shout from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. He stopped and turned around. Behind him, two people were striding toward him.</p><p>There were two young people and a woman. She was about eighteen or nineteen years old and was slightly older than Lu Ming. She was very beautiful.</p><p>There was also a young man around 15 or 16 years old. He looked similar to the woman, with red lips and white teeth. He was very handsome.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows moved slightly. He did not know these two people. He did not know why they were looking for him.</p><p>Could they be Hua Jie’s men?</p><p>“Are you two looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. I’m Mingzhu, and I admire you for teaching Hua Jie a lesson earlier. That’s why I’d like to get to know you!</p><p>The young woman cupped her fists.</p><p>“My name is Ming Feng, my name is Ming Feng. What’s your name, brother? It was so satisfying just now. I wanted to help, but my sister stopped me. ”</p><p>The youth called out, appearing very lively.</p><p>Their eyes were pure and they had no ill intentions. What they wanted to say was true.</p><p>“I’m tianyun!” Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Tianyun was the reverse of Lu Yuntian’s name.</p><p>Since he had changed his appearance, he naturally had to change his name as well.</p><p>so it’s brother Tian. Brother Tian, you look young, but your cultivation is so profound that it’s truly admirable. You’re not afraid of Hua Jie at all, and you even attacked him. I’m ashamed of you!</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>“You’re too polite. It was just a small effort just now. It’s nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, you’re too humble. I don’t have that kind of cultivation. Otherwise, I would have taught that Hua Jie a lesson. Hahaha, he actually peed his pants just now. That was really fun. It will definitely cause a sensation in the imperial capital in the future!”</p><p>Ming Feng laughed loudly. He was really good at pulling strings and directly called him big brother tianyun.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind. He just smiled.</p><p>“Brother Tian, this should be your first time coming to the Imperial City, right?”</p><p>Mingzhu asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Ming Zhu nodded her head, and with an expression that said “as expected,” she continued,”Brother Tian, even though that Hua Jie is a good-for-nothing rich kid and is not worth mentioning, his father is the heavenly suppression King. You must be careful.”</p><p>“Heavenly King Zhen? Is he very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. To be honest, he had not heard of the heavenly suppression King before.</p><p>“Strong, of course he’s strong!”</p><p>A hint of fear flashed in Mingzhu’s eyes, and she said, ” heavenly suppression King is the elder brother of the current Emperor. His cultivation is extremely profound, and he is in charge of more than half of the world’s military power. He has never been defeated. It is said that his relationship with the ten direction Sword School is also extraordinary.</p><p>“Oh, he’s really an important person!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly, showing no fear.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
