He flew more than ten meters and stood still with his sword in hand.</p><p>There was a bloody gash on his shoulder, and blood was seeping out.</p><p>Did Zhang Muyun lose?</p><p>Everyone’s heart turned cold.</p><p>“I lost! Qilin Hall’s geniuses truly live up to their reputation!”</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Muyun sighed.</p><p>you’re not bad. You can exchange so many moves with me, but that’s all. You can’t make me use my full strength. Four great academies and the bronze rank. What a disappointment.</p><p>Jian wuchen held his long sword and laughed in disdain.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned ugly, but they couldn’t refute it, because the truth was right in front of them. The more they refuted, the more disgraceful it would be.</p><p>Jian wuchen, I’m no match for you, but I’m not the strongest on the bronze list. There’s someone else who’s above me. It’s too early for you to insult the entire bronze list.</p><p>Zhang Muyun frowned.</p><p>Everyone was moved.</p><p>That’s right, there was another person above Zhang Muyun.</p><p>He was a peerless genius who had made it to the top of the bronze ranking in his first year in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>Everyone thought of Lu Ming.</p><p>More than two months ago, Lu Ming had only gained a slight upper hand in his battle with Zhang Muyun.</p><p>However, given Lu Ming’s amazing speed of improvement, would he be stronger after two months? Would he be able to fight with Jian wuchen?</p><p>“I know that you’re only ranked second on the bronze ranking. I heard that the person who ranked first is a guy named Lu Ming. Tell him to come out and fight with me. I want to crush him completely, so that you won’t have any fantasies.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said arrogantly.</p><p>Although he had met Lu Ming at the mountain range by the sea, he did not know his name. Of course, he did not know that he had already met Lu Ming, who was ranked first on the bronze list.</p><p>“Lu Ming isn’t here today. Otherwise, I’ll definitely be able to fight you!”</p><p>Ling Kong said in a deep voice.</p><p>“You can fight me? You guys really know how to console yourselves. Then, get him out here. He’s not here, is he? Send someone to call him over so that I won’t have to look for him in the future. We’ll settle this today.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, Duan gang, Ling Kong, and the rest were silent. They did not know where Lu Ming was. Moreover, they were not sure if Lu Ming could really fight against Jian wuchen.</p><p>“Haha, why don’t you send someone to look for him? Did he know that he was no match for me? “I don’t care if he’s the first on the bronze ranking. He’s the same as me. Lu Ming? if I use all my strength, I’ll finish him in three moves.”</p><p>Jian wuchen sneered.</p><p>The other two geniuses from Qilin Hall also laughed.</p><p>it’s a pity that guy isn’t here. Otherwise, I would have been able to beat him up.</p><p>Jian wuchen scanned the crowd and was a little disappointed. He was looking for Lu Ming, of course.</p><p>“Which son of a b * tch is looking for me?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard from afar.</p><p>This voice was very familiar to many people. As soon as the voice rang out, most of their hearts skipped a beat. A name jumped into their minds: Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming was here!</p><p>Their eyes quickly looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Sure enough, he saw a young man in a black robe. He was tall and had a faint smile on his face. He walked over step by step with his hands behind his back.</p><p>If it was not Lu Ming, who else could it be?</p><p>Lu Ming was really here!</p><p>For some reason, most of them couldn’t help but Show hope and joy in their hearts.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, Ling Kong, Duan gang, bu xingkai, Zhuo yirong, Cheng Feicheng …</p><p>They were all the same. They subconsciously thought that as long as Lu Ming was here, he would be able to defeat the other party.</p><p>When they came back to their senses, they were shocked. They did not know why they had such a feeling. Perhaps it was because Lu Ming had created too many miracles in the great competition of the four courtyards.</p><p>Jian wuchen also turned his head to take a look. With one look, a strong killing intent spread out from his body.</p><p>“Little bastard, it’s you?”</p><p>Jian wuchen shouted angrily.</p><p>“Son of a b * tch, weren’t you looking for me just now? Why did you get so angry when you saw me?”</p><p>There was still a faint smile on Lu Ming’s face. He walked slowly with his hands behind his back. He was taking a stroll in the courtyard, looking very relaxed.</p><p>“Kid, Who are you? How dare you speak to senior brother Jian like that? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The strong young man shouted coldly. His body was like a wild ox as he charged towards Lu Ming. His huge fist was black and shiny, like metal.</p><p>The strong young man was not there that day at the mountain range by the sea. Hence, he did not recognize Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The well-built young man closed in on Lu Ming in an instant and his huge fist was aimed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips were still curled into a faint smile as he threw a punch as well.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two fists collided, and everyone heard the sound of bones breaking. Then, a tall figure flew back at a speed faster than he had pounced, and fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>“My hand!”</p><p>The strong young man bellowed. One of his arms was bent and deformed. It was obvious that Lu Ming had broken it with one punch.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The eyes of the people from the four courtyards lit up.</p><p>Just now, the strong young man’s strength was obvious to all. He had defeated all the Masters below the top ten of the bronze rank.</p><p>However, his arm was broken by Lu Ming’s casual punch.</p><p>The difference was too great, and everyone couldn’t help but feel hope rise in their hearts.</p><p>“Little b * stard, so you’re Lu Ming!”</p><p>Jian wuchen roared with an extremely cold voice.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and ignored Jian wuchen. He walked toward Zhang Muyun and cupped his fists.”Brother mu Yun, congratulations, congratulations. Congratulations on bringing home a beauty.”</p><p>“Thank you, Junior Brother Lu, for coming to congratulate me personally!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun also cupped his fists.</p><p>“Thank you, Junior Brother Lu!”</p><p>Beside Zhang Muyun, Zhuo yirong also bowed.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I came in a hurry today and didn’t have time to prepare a gift!”</p><p>Lu Ming spread his hands and smiled.</p><p>it’s good enough that Junior Brother Lu can come, ” Zhang Muyun said. there’s no need for any gifts. The two of them chatted, completely ignoring Jian wuchen.</p><p>This made the killing intent in Jian wuchen’s eyes grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to ignore me? Don’t think that you can be arrogant in front of me just because you’re the No. 1 on the bronze list. Today, I’ll let you clearly realize the gap between you and me. ”</p><p>Jian wuchen’s voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming turned to look at Jian wuchen. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said with a smile,”Brother mu Yun, I have a gift.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and walked toward Jian wuchen.”Didn’t you want me to know the difference between us? Make your move? I will defeat you in three moves!”</p><p>The surrounding people were dumbfounded.</p><p>What did Lu Ming say?</p><p>He defeated Jian wuchen in three moves?</p><p>How was that possible? It was impossible!</p><p>Could Lu Ming have broken through to the martial Grandmaster realm? It shouldn’t be that fast, right? Moreover, Lu Ming was really a martial Grandmaster. What was the point of defeating Jian wuchen?</p><p>Jian wuchen was mad, but Lu Ming was even more mad than Jian wuchen!</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
