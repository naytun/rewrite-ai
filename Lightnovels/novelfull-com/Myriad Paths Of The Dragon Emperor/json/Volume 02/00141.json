Defeat me in three moves? Defeat me in three moves?”</p><p>Jian wuchen laughed crazily as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.</p><p>Earlier on, he had said that he would use all his strength and defeat Lu Ming in three moves.</p><p>However, Lu Ming actually said that he would defeat him in three moves? Wasn’t that the funniest joke in the world?</p><p>“Lu Ming, anyone can boast, but it’s just a joke if you don’t have the ability.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said coldly.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it made sense. He pondered for a moment and nodded. that’s right. Without strength, it’s just a joke. You’ll soon find out that you’re the joke.</p><p>“It’s useless to have a sharp tongue. Lu Ming, let me tell you, Qiu Yue is the woman that I, Jian wuchen, have set my heart on. You dared to hold her hand that day. This is your fate. Ever since you held her hand, your fate has been decided. Today, I will cripple your hand, break your limbs, cripple your cultivation, and throw you out of the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>don’t think that the sect will stand up for you just because you’re the No. 1 on the bronze list. Let me tell you, your so-called No. 1 on the bronze list is nothing but trash compared to me.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s voice was cold. Of course, this sentence was transmitted, so no one else heard it.</p><p>“Qiuyue? Don’t even think about it, Qiu Yue. She’s already my woman.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What … What?”</p><p>Jian wuchen was stunned, as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>After a long while, he finally reacted. His eyes were red, and his handsome face was completely twisted. He became extremely ferocious as he shouted hysterically, ” Lu Ming, you deserve to die. You lowly bastard. How dare you touch the woman I, Jian wuchen, have set my heart on? if I don’t cripple you today, my name isn’t Jian wuchen!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Jian wuchen unsheathed his sword and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>kill! Kill! Ancient jade eight kills!</p><p>Jian wuchen roared. His killing intent was like a tide. The sword Qi that was as crystal clear as Jade surged towards Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>With a flash of light, the fire Tung spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>The long spear swept out, and the red moonlight appeared. All of Jian wuchen’s sword Qi was instantly destroyed. The long spear did not stop, and it went straight for Jian wuchen’s face.</p><p>At that moment, the anger in Jian wuchen’s heart seemed to have been doused by a plate of cold water. He shuddered.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>He retreated quickly and blocked the attack with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear swept against Jian wuchen’s long sword, and the fierce fire of ruin slapped Jian wuchen’s face, causing him to feel a burning pain.</p><p>He retreated dozens of meters rapidly and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>The power of Lu Ming’s spear was extremely terrifying. It was beyond his imagination.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? He must’ve used some sort of secret technique. He won’t be able to last long.”</p><p>Jian wuchen couldn’t accept it and roared in his heart.</p><p>The Bronze, Silver, and silver-robed disciples were all stunned.</p><p>He sent Jian wuchen flying with a single strike?</p><p>How was this possible? Jian wuchen was stronger than Zhang Muyun, but Lu Ming had sent him flying with one strike. Wasn’t this too exaggerated?</p><p>Lu Ming had improved so much in the past two months?</p><p>It was too unbelievable.</p><p>Compared to the Grand competition of the four courtyards, Lu Ming’s cultivation had increased to the peak of the ninth grade master realm, his true war Dragon technique had reached the third level, and his fire controlling gun technique had also achieved a breakthrough. His combat strength had increased by several times.</p><p>It was normal for him to send Jian wuchen flying with a single strike.</p><p>“Back in the mountain range by the sea, I told you I only used twenty percent of my power, but you didn’t believe me. Hehe.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jian wuchen with a mocking smile.</p><p>let’s see how many moves you can unleash. Eight kills of ancient jade, soul kill!</p><p>Jian wuchen roared and once again exploded with a strong murderous aura. He became one with his sword and turned into a brilliant sword Qi, charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword aura had yet to reach him, but the glow on it was enough to make Lu Ming feel slightly dizzy.</p><p>what a powerful sword technique. This sword technique can even affect the soul.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered and he fired another shot.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming put in more effort in this shot.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just like before, the long spear swept across and the sword Qi was destroyed. This time, Jian wuchen could no longer withstand it and was sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>In the air, Jian wuchen coughed up a large amount of blood and smashed into a fake mountain, causing it to explode.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The crowd cheered and were extremely excited.</p><p>If they didn’t hold it in, they would have jumped up.</p><p>It was too strong, too cool, they were not on the same level at all.</p><p>They could only shout and vent the pent-up anger in their hearts.</p><p>Previously, he was too aggrieved and couldn’t stand up.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had completely suppressed Jian wuchen the moment he arrived. How could he not be happy?</p><p>Not far away, Zhang Muyun smiled bitterly. He could already feel that Lu Ming was so strong that he would never forget him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you piece of trash. How dare you hurt me? I’ll skin you alive.”</p><p>Jian wuchen roared hysterically.</p><p>At this moment, his hair was disheveled and his clothes were torn and tattered. He was in a sorry state.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. you keep calling him trash. Yet, you were sent flying by my spear. I really don’t know where you get your confidence from.</p><p>trash, trash, you’re all trash. I have a special bloodline that is incomparably noble. How can you trash compare to me? ”</p><p>Jian wuchen shouted.</p><p>Everyone was speechless. Lu Ming shook his head and said, don’t talk nonsense. There’s still one more move. I can’t be bothered to make another move. You, come at me together.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the saber-hugging youth.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Lu Ming was challenging the saber-hugging youth and Jian wuchen?</p><p>One against two!</p><p>Jian wuchen’s face twisted crazily. He was being looked down upon.</p><p>“Junior Brother Liu, since this b * stard is looking for death, let’s attack together and cripple him!”</p><p>Jian wuchen shouted.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The blade Qi whistled as the young man brandished his battle blade. An extremely overbearing blade Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Then, there was a flash of blood.</p><p>An ancient battle saber appeared above the saber-hugging youth’s head, causing the saber Qi to become even more intense.</p><p>The saber-hugging young man was at the peak ninth grade master realm, but he had yet to comprehend the controlling force.</p><p>On the other side, an ancient combat sword appeared above Jian wuchen’s head.</p><p>As soon as the bloodline appeared, Jian wuchen’s sword Qi and metal force exploded to the peak.</p><p>Their bloodlines erupted, and the two of them unleashed their full power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man and Jian wuchen unleashed their strongest combat power and performed their strongest moves, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The saber radiance and sword Qi filled Half the Sky.</p><p>This power made many silver disciples “faces change.</p><p>It was too powerful. A special bloodline was too terrifying. Fighting above one’s level was a common occurrence for them.</p><p>This was something that was brought about by the upper Sky Realm, and there was nothing to be envious of.</p><p>Could Lu Ming block it?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura rose from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The power of fire erupted.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
