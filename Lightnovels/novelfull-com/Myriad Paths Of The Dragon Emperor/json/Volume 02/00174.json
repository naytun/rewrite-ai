After refining the essence of more than ten hundred-year prawns, Lu Ming’s physical body was getting closer and closer to the upper tier of the second stage.</p><p>“It tastes really good, but it should be better if I change the taste!”</p><p>Lu Ming clicked his tongue. Then, his eyes lit up. He got up and walked out, coming to the flaming passageway.</p><p>As soon as he entered the passage, flames and flame spirits emerged from the passage.</p><p>“Roast it for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than ten centuries-old prawns appeared. They were controlled by Lu Ming’s essential Qi and floated in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually used the flames here to roast the prawns. If the Dongyi ancestors who had set up the inscriptions were to see this, they would be so angry that they would climb out of their coffins.</p><p>Zzzzzzzz</p><p>The centuries-old prawns emitted a sizzling sound, and soon, the fragrance assailed his nose.</p><p>As for the flame spirits, they were all blasted away by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>As time passed, the fragrance became stronger and stronger. In the end, the fragrance filled the entire underground cave.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure appeared at the entrance of a cave and looked over curiously.</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming looking at her, she could not help but let out a cold snort and returned to the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with her. At that moment, the century shrimp had been roasted and its entire body had turned red. He moved his index finger and went out of the passage. He picked up one and peeled it. The aroma was several times stronger after he peeled the shell.</p><p>He couldn’t wait to take a bite. It was soft and tender, and the fragrance was incomparably rich. It was several times more delicious than when it wasn’t roasted.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming finished the dozen or so roasted prawns like a tornado. He then returned to the cave in satisfaction to refine the essence of the roasted prawns.</p><p>His physical body was constantly improving.</p><p>Not long after, the essence of the dozen or so roasted prawns was refined. At this time, a strong fragrance came from outside.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the cave and saw Xie nianqing copying him. He was roasting prawns in the passageway!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red when he saw Lu Ming. He glared at Lu Ming and snorted coldly before continuing to roast the prawns.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He returned to the cave and continued cultivating.</p><p>Five days later, Lu Ming finished his hundred-year prawns and went to the underground river to catch more. Xie nianqing was helpless. Lu Ming had cultivated the ancient shield technique and she could not break it for the time being. She could only let Lu Ming catch more.</p><p>To break through an earth rank defensive martial skill, only a similar earth rank offensive martial skill could have a possibility.</p><p>Or perhaps his cultivation was too much stronger.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation technique was special. She hadn’t started to cultivate earth level martial skills yet.</p><p>“Hmph, just wait until I cultivate an earth grade martial skill, I’ll make you suffer!”</p><p>Xie nianqing could only comfort himself in this way.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming would go to catch the century shrimp every few days.</p><p>Time flew by, and three months had passed since the collapse of the small plane.</p><p>In the last period of time, with the help of the centenarian shrimp, Lu Ming’s physical body directly rushed to complete second-grade. The progress was so fast that Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Therefore, in the last few days, Lu Ming was hunting for century prawns crazily and storing them.</p><p>Of course, Xie nianqing was the same. Almost all the hundred-year prawns in that section of the river were caught.</p><p>Once the three months were up, the place where the stone altar had exploded began to emit rays of light.</p><p>On the ground, inscriptions glowed and covered the ground like a net.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood at the side and waited.</p><p>A few hours later, the inscriptions glowed and finally condensed into a door of light.</p><p>Spatial path, teleportation gate.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He could finally get out after being trapped here for three months.</p><p>He had gained a lot in the past three months.</p><p>Although the cultivation environment here was much better than the outside world, if he stayed here all the time, his family and friends outside would definitely be worried.</p><p>Moreover, cultivating arduously might not necessarily be more effective. A martial artist needed to train in the world of mortals, go through all kinds of things, and temper their mental state in order to keep improving.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the portal appeared, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing moved at the same time and rushed into the door of light.</p><p>After a moment of dizziness, Lu Ming realized that he was back on the nine demons mountain when he calmed down.</p><p>He and Xie nianqing were standing on a huge stone statue of a demonic beast. Under their feet, there was a bright light. Then, the light dimmed and everything returned to normal.</p><p>one-way teleportation. It seems like it’s impossible to enter in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll settle the score with you sooner or later. Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll play with you anytime, but don’t get beaten up by me the next time you see me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You beat me up? How was that possible? Next time, I’ll definitely break your turtle shell and trample you under my feet!”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and disappeared from the nine demon mountain like a Black Butterfly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind.</p><p>“I wonder how the war in East lacking city is going?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts returned to the war in East lacking city.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming’s figure moved. He stepped on the tip of a tree and rushed toward dongque city.</p><p>After half a day, dongque city was already in sight.</p><p>But now, the situation in dongque city was completely different from three months ago.</p><p>Three months ago, dongque city was on high alert. But now, the city gates were open, and people were coming in and out.</p><p>It seemed that the war in dongque city had ended.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered the city, he went straight to the city Lord’s residence. He wanted to find Fu Liang to find out more about the situation.</p><p>When he revealed his identity as a mystical sword sect disciple, he naturally met Fu Liang without any obstructions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not dead?”</p><p>Fu Liang was shocked to see Lu Ming.</p><p>“City Lord Fu, I’m fine!” Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Young hero Lu Ming, it’s great that you’re not dead. The disciples of the mystical sword sect came back that day and said that you died in the ruins of the Dongyi tribe.”</p><p>Fu Liang explained the situation during this period.</p><p>Three months ago, the mystical sword sect disciples had returned. There were only about 50 of them left, and they said that the rest had died in the Dongyi tribe’s ruins.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe also retreated to the mountains by the sea a day later.</p><p>This incident shook the mystical sword sect. Many people came to look for Lu Ming but they all returned empty-handed.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that those people should be pang Shi, Feng Wu, Mu Lan, and the others.</p><p>I heard that the mystical sword sect has confirmed your death in battle and has even informed your family.</p><p>Fu Liang said.</p><p>“What? I’ve already informed my family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart tightened.</p><p>How sad would Li Ping be if she knew that he was already ‘dead’?</p><p>In Li Ping’s heart, Lu Yuntian was already dead. Lu Ming was her only hope. If she knew that Lu Ming was ‘dead’, how desperate would she be?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart was set on returning home.</p><p>city Lord Fu, thank you very much. I have to make a trip home now. Goodbye!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left the castellan’s residence without a moment’s delay. He rushed towards fiery wind city.</p><p>Fortunately, dongque city was not too far away from fiery wind city. Lu Ming used his midair steps and rushed at full speed. He was like a gust of wind, rushing towards fiery wind city.</p><p>When his genuine Qi was exhausted, he would use spiritual crystals to recover it.</p><p>Lu Ming finally returned to fiery wind city three days later.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
