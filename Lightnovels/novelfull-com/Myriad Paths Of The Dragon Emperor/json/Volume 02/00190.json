Your master is Lu yunxiong, right?”</p><p>The five branch heads turned pale, and one of them said, ” young master, you’ve misunderstood. The force that Lu yunxiong brought with him that day was too strong. If we were to resist, we would definitely be annihilated. If that were to happen, the Lu family would really be finished!</p><p>that’s right, young master. We surrendered to Lu yunxiong only because we wanted to save our lives. We’ll wait for you to return.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the few of them with a faint smile. He did not say anything but picked up the teacup and slowly sipped the tea.</p><p>The five branch Masters looked at each other. They did not know what Lu Ming was thinking, and they felt uneasy.</p><p>“At that time, the mystical sword sect seemed to have already informed me of my death, right? You’re still waiting for my return? Could it be that you already knew that I wasn’t dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>The five of them began to sweat. They looked at each other and then said, ” the young master is so talented. How could he die so easily? we guessed that the young master was not dead, so we used that plan.</p><p>“Oh? So that’s how it is, you’re all so resourceful that you can even help people read their fortunes!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently and continued to drink his tea.</p><p>The five branch Masters ‘faces turned red, but they could only grit their teeth and remain silent.</p><p>The atmosphere seemed to have frozen at once. Lu Ming sipped his tea, the three core elders and Li Ping did not speak, and the five branch Masters could only stand there, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>The current Lu Ming was no longer the useless young master from back then. His combat strength was unparalleled, and his cultivation had reached an unbelievable realm. Crushing them to death was as easy as crushing an ant. He had formed a very powerful aura without them knowing.</p><p>They did not even dare to breathe loudly in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ve already killed Lu yunxiong!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Not only the five branch Masters, but the three core elders were also shocked.</p><p>“I’ve already killed Lu yunxiong in The White Tiger Hall. So, don’t even think that you’ll be lucky. This is the fate of those who betray the Lu family.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed Lu yunxiong at The White Tiger Hall and returned alive. How capable was he?</p><p>They could not imagine it.</p><p>At the same time, the five branch Masters were terrified. They looked at each other and knelt down together. young master, we were really foolish that day. Please forgive us. We will wholeheartedly assist you in the future and revitalize the Lu family. If we disobey, we will die a horrible death!</p><p>“Why do I not believe it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the five branch Masters with a faint smile.</p><p>The cold sweat on the faces of the five branch Masters became even more concentrated, and it kept dripping down.</p><p>“How about this? all of you swear an oath to the inner demons, and I’ll believe you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“An oath of inner demons!”</p><p>The five branch Masters ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The so-called oath of the heart demon was an oath to one’s heart, using one’s blood essence as a step.</p><p>Once a martial artist made a mental demon oath, if he were to go against it in the future, it would be very easy for his mental demons to act up during cultivation, and he would die from Qi deviation.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If you don’t want to make an oath, I won’t be at ease leaving you behind.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold.</p><p>The five branch heads ‘expressions changed drastically, and they hurriedly said, ” “We swear an oath!”</p><p>After that, the five of them made the oath of inner demons.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled and said, ” “In the future, you will know that your choice is correct. Now, go down!”</p><p>The five branch Masters quickly took their leave.</p><p>three elders, the Lu family’s strength has been greatly reduced after going through so many twists and turns. However, the quality of the people is more important than the quantity. I have some secret cultivation techniques here. You can take them and cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming’s phone glowed. A stack of books appeared on the table.</p><p>a cultivation technique or martial skill manual? ”</p><p>The three core elders were a little puzzled. They each picked up a book and flipped through it.</p><p>As soon as they opened it, the three of them widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“A yellow grade upper level martial arts technique!”</p><p>“Mine is also a yellow grade upper level!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>The three core elders exclaimed in unison.</p><p>“Three elders, here are five sets of yellow grade upper level martial arts techniques and ten sets of yellow grade lower level martial arts techniques. You can take them to cultivate, or you can choose the best seedlings in the family and pass them on to them.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Five yellow tier upper level and ten yellow tier lower level?”</p><p>The three core elders gasped.</p><p>The Lu family only had one upper yellow level cultivation skill, which was regarded as the clan’s most important cultivation skill. Ordinary people were not qualified to cultivate it.</p><p>The Lu clan did not have many yellow level lower class martial arts techniques, only six or seven of them.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had actually taken out so many cultivation technique secret manuals in one go. If the Lu family’s disciples cultivated them, their abilities would increase by a large margin very quickly.</p><p>“Many thanks, young master!”</p><p>The three core elders thanked Lu Ming, their bodies trembling with excitement.</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me, elders. Since I’m the Lu family’s young master, this is what I should do.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the ruins of the Dongyi tribe, Lu Ming had obtained more than 30 yellow grade cultivation methods and martial arts techniques. These martial arts techniques were not of much use to him and could only be sold. He might as well keep them with the Lu family and increase their strength.</p><p>“There’s more!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and some Jade bottles appeared on the table.</p><p>These Jade bottles contained some medicinal pills.</p><p>Some could heal injuries, some could dispel poison, and some could raise the cultivation of martial artists in the warrior realm and even the master realm.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained them from the enemies he had killed. They were not of much use to him, but they were very useful to the majority of the Lu clan’s invigorated Meridian realm and warrior realm martial artists.</p><p>take all these pills. As for how to split them, you guys decide!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Young master, you’ve given everything to the family. What about you?”</p><p>One of the core elders said.</p><p>“Take it. I have no use for these.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>alright, that’s good. We’ll take it. We’ll definitely select disciples who are loyal to the Lu family and distribute it to them to improve the Lu family’s strength.</p><p>Another core elder said excitedly.</p><p>The three of them carefully put away the pills.</p><p>Li Ping was so happy that she could not close her mouth when she saw Lu Ming taking out so many treasures.</p><p>After the three core elders kept the items, they bade Lu Ming farewell. They were in a hurry to go back and discuss how to make good use of these treasures. They could not let the Lu family improve their strength as soon as possible.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed at the Lu family for seven days.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming decided to bid farewell to Li Ping.</p><p>He could not hide in the Lu clan forever. There were some things that he had to face. Moreover, he had to investigate Lu Yuntian’s whereabouts as soon as possible.</p><p>In the main manor’s courtyard.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, be careful when you go out!”</p><p>Li Ping did not ask Lu Ming to stay. She only reminded him to be careful.</p><p>A man’s ambition was to travel far and wide. Moreover, a genius like Lu Ming would not be trapped in one place. That would only restrict him.</p><p>Li Ping was well aware of this, so she did not try to persuade him to stay.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. Ming ‘er will be fine.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming pondered and hesitated. After a while, he said,”Mother, Ming ‘er has something to tell you!”</p><p>Lu Ming intended to tell Li Ping that Lu Yuntian might still be alive.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
