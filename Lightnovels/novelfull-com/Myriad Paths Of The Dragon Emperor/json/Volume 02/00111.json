However, she did not expect that after she came out of seclusion, Lu yunxiong would tell her that Lu Ming had killed Yao Tianyu, made it to the bronze rank, and was going to participate in the great competition of the four courtyards.</p><p>The moment she heard it, she was stunned. It was simply unbelievable and unacceptable. She thought that she had heard wrong.</p><p>She could not bear it. She was full of confidence and thought that she could trample on Lu Ming. However, the truth was the opposite. She had spent a lot of resources but she was getting further and further away from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that little bastard. How did he improve so quickly? God is really unfair to let this little bastard have such strong talent.”</p><p>On the side, Lu yunxiong gritted his teeth, his voice extremely gloomy.</p><p>“No matter how strong Lu Ming is, he’s just trash in front of brother Lin.”</p><p>Lu Yao said in a deep voice.</p><p>haha, miss Lu is right. How can Lu Ming, that little b * stard, compare to young master Lin? he’s worlds apart.</p><p>Many young men from the Duanmu family sat beside Lu Yao and the others. One of them sneered.</p><p>“That’s right. Moreover, Lu Ming won’t be able to go far in this competition. If he meets a genius from the Duanmu family, he’ll definitely be crippled. Even if he’s lucky enough to make it into the top 30, the geniuses from the Duanmu family will definitely challenge him at the first opportunity,”</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>“That’s good. With the heroes of the Duanmu family here, I can rest assured.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about this.</p><p>In the fighting ring, tens of thousands of eyes were looking at them. Among the sixty people, some were so excited that their faces turned red. Some were rubbing their fists and wiping their palms. They glanced at the others with hostility.</p><p>There were also some who were calm and composed, with all kinds of expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>First, the silver-robed elders would draw 30 people, and then these 30 people would draw the remaining 30 people. Whoever was drawn would be their opponent in the first round.</p><p>Lu Ming was one of the first thirty people to be drawn.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the other thirty people went up to draw lots.</p><p>Very soon, the drawing of lots was completed. Lu Ming had drawn number 46.</p><p>“Number 46? I’m quite lucky!” Lu Ming smiled and registered the silver-robed elder with it. Then, he returned to his seat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what number did you draw?”</p><p>Feng Wu hurriedly asked.</p><p>“Number 46!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Number 46, Yun Feng from the Onyx tortoise Hall. Lu Ming, you’re in luck.”</p><p>Hua Chi asked in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was not too bothered. To him, it was just a battle no matter who he drew.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A melodious Bell rang, indicating that the exciting great competition of the four courtyards was about to begin.</p><p>now, the great competition of the four courtyards officially begins. Before it begins, you must pay attention to one of the most basic rules. In this competition, you can’t harm your life. You can do whatever you want with other things. Also, you can’t use any medicinal pills to improve your combat strength, except for secret skills.</p><p>now, let’s officially begin. The first battle, No. 60 versus No. 23!</p><p>On the fighting ring, the silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>“Number 60? Isn’t that the genius from the Vermillion Bird Hall, Liu Hui, who just entered the bronze ranking?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>In the Vermillion Bird hall area, an ordinary-looking, thin young man walked out of the crowd and went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Haha, I’m so lucky to have met the trash from the Vermillion Bird Hall.”</p><p>From The White Tiger Hall’s area, a loud laugh was heard. Then, a young man appeared on the fighting ring with a few leaps.</p><p>“Number 23, Duanmu yunchong of the Duanmu family.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“The Duanmu family has indeed produced many talents in recent years.”</p><p>Feng Wu said with a grim look in her eyes.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Duanmu yunchong looked at Liu Hui with a mocking expression and said, ” “Trash from the Vermillion Bird Hall, kneel down and admit defeat now! Otherwise, you’ll be in for it. ”</p><p>Liu Hui’s expression was unsightly as he stared at Duanmu yunchong without saying a word. His eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>trash, it seems like you really want to fight me. Don’t worry, I can defeat you with one move. I’ll let you know that it was only luck that you managed to get into the bronze rank. Also, let me tell you, your Vermillion Bird Hall is destined to be swept away this time. Don’t even think about getting into the top ten.</p><p>Duanmu yunchong sneered. He was extremely arrogant and haughty.</p><p>“Damn it, the Duanmu family is really f * cking despicable.”</p><p>you still want to sweep us aside? dream on! Senior Sister Cheng feichen will definitely be in the top ten.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were all furious as they cursed.</p><p>“A bunch of nonsense, you only know how to talk.”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Duanmu yunchong said with a disdainful expression.</p><p>Liu Hui’s face was gloomy. He tightly held the hilt of his sword with one hand and stared at Duanmu yunchong. Suddenly, Liu Hui rushed out. His long sword was unsheathed and turned into a ray of silver light, piercing toward Duanmu yunchong.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Liu Hui was performing a black level low-rank sword technique. However, he had only just reached the second level.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong coldly sneered. His body moved and he dodged Liu Hui’s attack.</p><p>Black grade low level movement technique.</p><p>At the same time, Duanmu yunchong struck out with his palm. The wind from his palm whistled like thunder.</p><p>A black grade low level palm technique, another black grade martial arts technique.</p><p>It was obvious that Duanmu yunchong had mastered two profound grade martial skills. When they were used in pairs, they were as fast as lightning and as fast as Thunder, increasing their battle strength by a large margin.</p><p>Liu Hui’s sword had missed. He wanted to Dodge, but it was too late. He could only use his other hand to block the palm.</p><p>However, Liu Hui’s palm strike was only launched out of desperation. How could it withstand Duanmu yunchong’s Black level palm energy?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Liu Hui’s body flew out and he retreated more than ten meters. His face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Damn it, you actually dared to block my palm. You asked for it!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong bellowed in his heart. His expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p>He had said that he would deal with Liu Hui in one move, but now Liu Hui had actually blocked one move. He felt that he had lost a lot of face.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Duanmu yunchong’s figure moved. He used his black grade movement technique and moved as fast as a ghost. He instantly appeared behind Liu Hui and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Although Liu Hui was on full alert and quickly slashed his sword behind him, he was still a step too slow due to his injuries.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The palm hit Liu Hui’s chest.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Liu Hui spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>Duanmu yunchong followed closely behind. Without giving Liu Hui the chance to catch his breath, he struck out another palm.</p><p>However, this palm was aimed at Liu Hui’s face.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A clear sound of a slap was heard. Duanmu yunchong had ruthlessly slapped Liu Hui’s face.</p><p>Liu Hui’s entire body was sent flying.</p><p>However, Duanmu yunchong did not have the intention to let go. His body moved and caught up with Liu Hui. Another slap landed on Liu Hui’s face.</p><p>Liu Hui was sent flying and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Trash, I told you to admit defeat a long time ago. What now? I’ve beaten you like a dog.”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong looked down at Liu Hui and said in disdain.</p><p>“Damn it, Duanmu yunchong, don’t go too far. A warrior can be killed but not humiliated.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were filled with righteous indignation. Someone shouted.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
