It’s so complicated. No wonder I didn’t think of it. Love-struck fool, you’ve thought of it before, haven’t you?”</p><p>Pang Shi laughed and asked.</p><p>that’s right. Hua Chi smiled and nodded. when Lu Ming fought, there were only six or seven matches left. He only admitted defeat after displaying his powerful abilities. Isn’t that strange? I also deduced from this that he was absolutely confident that he would be selected to challenge. That’s why he did that.”</p><p>“This guy’s way of doing things is really evil and unexpected.”</p><p>Feng Wu said, pouting.</p><p>Not far away, Liu Hui’s injuries had already stabilized. He muttered, ” “Lu Ming!”</p><p>His eyes were filled with gratitude.</p><p>The other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples ‘gazes changed as well. They looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>However, it was different for the disciples of The White Tiger Hall, especially those from the Duanmu family. They were all furious.</p><p>“Damn this Lu Ming. He’s trying to go against the Duanmu family.”</p><p>“That’s right. We haven’t even settled all the scores from before. Now, he dares to provoke us again. Duanmu yunchong, go. Let him know that challenging you was a mistake.”</p><p>Some of the Duanmu family’s young men shouted.</p><p>don’t worry. He admitted defeat on purpose and challenged me to stand up for Liu Hui. I will let him know how stupid his actions are.</p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Duanmu yunchong’s face. He then stepped forward and appeared on the fighting ring like a ghost.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you want to stand up for Liu Hui. Later on, I will make you suffer ten times more than Liu Hui.”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong said in a malevolent manner.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently. I’ve seen a lot of trash like you. Every one of them was very arrogant at the beginning. Just like Yao Tianyu and his gang. In the end, they all became dead dogs.</p><p>that’s right. All the best, senior brother Lu Ming. Beat him up until he’s a dead dog!</p><p>beat him up! Avenge senior brother Liu Hui!</p><p>all hail senior brother Lu Ming! All the best, senior brother Lu Ming!</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples shouted.</p><p>Previously, Duanmu yunchong had been too despicable. He had humiliated Liu Hui. The Vermillion Bird Hall’s disciples were united against the common enemy. Naturally, they would stand on Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Hmph, a bunch of trash. They only know how to Shout!</p><p>Hmph! Duanmu yunchong snorted coldly. His face was extremely gloomy. When he looked at Lu Ming, his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Duanmu Yun became impulsive and he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A black grade low level movement technique that was as fast as lightning.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood there without moving. He had no intention of dodging.</p><p>Just as Duanmu was about to reach Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s long spear swept out.</p><p>The half-moon appeared and swept across the land three meters ahead.</p><p>Duanmu yunchong was greatly shocked. His figure rapidly retreated and dodged this attack by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you think that it’s useful to rely on the length of your weapon? In your dreams!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong roared loudly. His figure flickered rapidly. In an instant, there seemed to be three Duanmu yunchongs ‘figures on the field, and they rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is the illusionary technique. Duanmu yunchong has cultivated it to the second level. It is said that if he were to cultivate it to the sixth level, he would be able to create seven figures.”</p><p>illusionary technique. It’s both real and fake. Let’s see how Lu Ming will break it!</p><p>Some senior disciples discussed.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. He swept his long spear across the two figures in front of him while his other hand blasted the figure behind him.</p><p>In the next moment, the two figures in front of him disappeared. Behind him, Duanmu yunchong’s palm collided with Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A loud boom resounded. Duanmu yunchong’s expression changed greatly and his body rapidly retreated.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong roared. It was simply unacceptable.</p><p>He was already close to Lu Ming, but he was still knocked back by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>How could they fight this?</p><p>He cultivated movement and palm techniques. He was definitely not Lu Ming’s match at a long distance, but he was not Lu Ming’s match at a close distance.</p><p>He was a little confused.</p><p>“Duanmu yunchong, you are too naïve if you think that you can be my opponent in close combat!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>His physical body was in the second grade lower tier, and his cultivation had reached the peak of the eighth grade master realm. He was much stronger than he was two months ago when he fought Yao Tianyu. Duanmu yunchong did not train his body and only relied on black grade palm techniques. How could he be Lu Ming’s opponent?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear in Lu Ming’s hands shook and vibrated violently. The Spear’s shaft vibrated the air and burst out with powerful air waves that charged toward Duanmu Yun.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Duanmu yunchong sent out powerful palm strikes, shattering the air waves created by the spear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear violently whipped toward Duanmu yunchong.</p><p>It was already too late for Duanmu yunchong to retreat from this spear.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong roared. His bloodline burst out and his palms turned red. The faint sound of a Tiger and leopard could be heard.</p><p>Then, he pushed his palms out and hit Lu Ming’s long spear with an overwhelming force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A muffled sound resounded. Then, the sound of bones breaking and Duanmu yunchong’s miserable shrieks could be heard.</p><p>Like a kite with a broken string, Duanmu yunchong’s figure was sent flying far away.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop there. His body moved and he took a few steps forward. It was as if he was riding on the clouds as he rapidly charged towards Duanmu Yun.</p><p>It was a yellow grade high level martial arts technique, soaring cloud steps.</p><p>Although it was not as good as a black grade movement technique, it was still much more powerful than the Dragon serpent steps from before.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had caught up with Duanmu yunchong who was still floating in the air.</p><p>At this moment, Duanmu yunchong’s facial features were all scrunched up due to the pain. When he saw Lu Ming chasing after him, his eyes were filled with horror and he shouted in a hoarse voice,”No, I …”</p><p>He was about to say ‘I admit defeat’, but before he could say it, Lu Ming’s long spear was pulled out from the bottom.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Duanmu yunchong’s ‘I admit defeat’ was forced back and turned into a mournful scream. His body was like a broken sack as he flew into the sky.</p><p>He flew up more than ten meters and landed heavily. Lu Ming pulled out his spear again and he flew up again.</p><p>At this moment, Duanmu yunchong was completely dumbfounded and muddleheaded. He had completely forgotten about the matter of him admitting defeat.</p><p>Everyone present was stunned. This was Lu Ming’s combat strength. He was too powerful. Duanmu yunchong would be completely abused.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Black level spear technique has already reached the peak of the third level and is about to break through the fourth level. In addition to his strong physical body, which is suspected to be of the second stage, his combat strength is very terrifying.</p><p>“Can’t you guys see? His body technique is at the yellow level upper rank, but he has already cultivated it to the sixth level.”</p><p>“Not bad, it’s really terrifying. How long has he been in the sect? how did he cultivate in such a short time? Could this be a peerless genius?”</p><p>his battle strength can’t have already entered the top fifteen, right? ”</p><p>“It’s hard to say!”</p><p>Some of the silver disciples around them looked at Lu Ming in shock and discussed among themselves.</p><p>However, they did not know that Lu Ming had not exerted his full strength. He had already cultivated the fire gun control art to the peak of the fourth level and had other means. If they knew, they would be shocked to the extreme.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
