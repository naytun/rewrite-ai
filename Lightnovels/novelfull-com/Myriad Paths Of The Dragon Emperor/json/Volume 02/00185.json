However, he was still defeated by Lu Ming. He was beaten to the point where he vomited blood.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had fused with the soul of a Demon King and it was not his own strength, this was still shocking enough.</p><p>This was because being able to fuse with and use the soul of a Demon King was a miracle in itself. It was impossible for ordinary people to do so.</p><p>what peerless genius? you’re just a short-sighted brat with a little bit of achievement. I’ll kill you now.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His body was wrapped in a thick silver light as he charged toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Audacious. He was truly audacious. Lu Ming actually wanted to kill Duanmu Lin.</p><p>One had to know that Duanmu Lin was the hope of the Duanmu family. He was the hope for the rise of the Duanmu family.</p><p>If he killed someone else, there would still be a buffer, but if he killed Duanmu Lin, the Duanmu family would definitely not rest until one of them was dead.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. He really wanted to kill Duanmu Lin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The silver full moon emitted endless radiance. Every ray of radiance was like a spear light that shot toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare?”</p><p>The silver-robed elder from the Duanmu family disregarded his injuries and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>The dazzling saber radiance was unleashed, but it dissipated as soon as it came into contact with the radiance of the full moon.</p><p>The silver-robed elder could not even withstand a single blow from this move. He spat out blood and was sent flying backward.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to charge toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Evil beast, How dare you!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout suddenly rang out in the heavens and earth.</p><p>With this shout, the world rumbled as an extremely powerful pressure exploded in the sky.</p><p>Many disciples of the four courtyards with weaker cultivation vomited blood. Their faces turned pale and they fell to the ground on their butts.</p><p>Then, the clouds in the sky rolled and a huge hand reached out from the clouds, grabbing at Lu Ming.</p><p>“The headmaster of The White Tiger Hall! It’s the headmaster of The White Tiger Hall!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster was too powerful. Although he was also a martial Grandmaster, he was much more powerful than the silver-robed elder or Duanmu Lin.</p><p>The huge hand was still in the sky. It shook slightly and an unbelievably strong force appeared and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The silver full moon was like a bubble, dissipating without a sound.</p><p>The giant Silver Wolf roared angrily, but it also collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. He spat out blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the giant palm did not stop. It continued to press toward Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely enveloped by the huge palm and it was difficult for him to Dodge.</p><p>“Duanmu pojun, you’re the headmaster of a school, but you’re actually attacking a junior disciple. Do you have any f * cking shame?”</p><p>At this moment, a furious roar came from the South. At the same time, a sword light crossed the void and slashed at the huge hand.</p><p>The sword light collided with the giant hand with irresistible force, directly crushing the giant hand into pieces. Then, it continued to fly out and cut into the clouds in the sky.</p><p>“Yan LAN!”</p><p>An angry roar came from the clouds, and then a terrifying blade light flashed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The energy swept through and the clouds dissipated, revealing a figure inside.</p><p>It was the headmaster of The White Tiger Hall, Duanmu pojun.</p><p>From the South, a figure appeared. It was the Vermillion Bird Hall’s head, Yan LAN.</p><p>The Headmasters of the two academies faced each other from a distance. Their auras intersected, and between heaven and earth, a huge pressure spread out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you b * stard, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Below, Duanmu Lin roared. His long hair fluttered in the wind, and his aura was demonic. His killing intent was so dense that it was almost tangible.</p><p>He had been injured by Lu Ming in front of everyone. To him, this was a great humiliation. He must kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An earth-shaking roar was heard. An extremely dense blood-red light was emitted from Duanmu Lin’s body. Then, a flood Dragon rushed out from his body.</p><p>This flood Dragon was more than ten meters long. It had a slender body, four claws on its abdomen, and black scales all over its body. Lightning constantly swam on the scales, and a King-like aura spread out.</p><p>The most eye-catching part was that there were two Meridian cycles on the black water Dragon’s body. These Meridian cycles were not blood-red in color, but silver.</p><p>Two silver chakra.</p><p>At the scene, almost everyone was stunned. Then, they shouted, ” King level bloodline, this is a King level bloodline!</p><p>and it’s a second rank royal bloodline! The bloodline that Duanmu Lin awakened for the second time is actually a second rank royal bloodline! This is too shocking!</p><p>what a monster! He has a chance to become a martial King!</p><p>Most of them couldn’t help but roar.</p><p>In the process of a warrior breaking through from the ninth grade great Martial Master realm to the martial ancestor realm, there would be a process of Nirvana.</p><p>During this process, one could awaken a second bloodline and a second type of bloodline.</p><p>Generally speaking, the bloodline level of the second awakening would be higher than the first.</p><p>As for whether the score would be higher or lower, it was completely uncertain. It depended on the individual’s potential and accumulation.</p><p>This was a true Nirvana. Some Warriors ‘first awakening of the bloodline was not high enough, but the second level could awaken an extremely high-level bloodline, and thus soar to the sky and become a world-famous expert.</p><p>For some martial artists, the first bloodline they awakened was of a very high level, but the second bloodline they awakened might only be one level higher than the first. In that case, they would slowly be caught up by others, even surpassed.</p><p>Generally speaking, there was another name for a level nine bloodline. It was called a common bloodline.</p><p>The chakra of a mortal-level bloodline was blood-red.</p><p>Above the ordinary bloodline, there was another level of bloodline, known as the king bloodline.</p><p>The king level bloodline was also divided into nine levels. Its Meridian cycle was silver, and it was unknown how much stronger it was compared to the ordinary Level bloodline.</p><p>No matter if it was the speed of cultivation or the increase in combat power, it was not something that ordinary bloodlines could compare to.</p><p>It was said that there was another kind of bloodline above the king bloodline, known as the divine bloodline.</p><p>However, a bloodline of this level was only a legend and was rarely seen in the world.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s second bloodline awakening was actually a second rank King bloodline. It was truly shocking.</p><p>It should be known that most people’s second bloodline awakening was only a ninth level ordinary bloodline at most. There were very few who could reach the king bloodline, one in ten thousand.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s King-level bloodline power rose his aura to the peak.</p><p>“Great sun Thunder Blade slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared as his saber cut through the air. Boundless saber radiance condensed into a sun.</p><p>This sun was twice as strong as the previous one.</p><p>“Silver Wolf Moon howl!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, pushing the power of the beast soul in his body to its limit. Another giant Silver Wolf appeared, howling at the sky. A silver full moon appeared, brighter than before.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, the sun and moon collided in the sky.</p><p>Boundless radiance filled the Air and Space trembled non-stop as if it was about to explode.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared crazily as his violent true Qi gushed out continuously.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also circulated the power of the beast soul to the extreme.</p><p>Kachakachachi</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was constantly emitting the sound of beans being fried.</p><p>His bones were trembling, his muscles were squirming, and blood was seeping out of his pores.</p><p>He was under too much pressure.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
