Unfortunately, one side of his face was swollen like a pig’s head. Blood was flowing from his mouth, and a few of his teeth had fallen out. He couldn’t speak properly.</p><p>Senior brother DU’s expression turned even uglier. Beside him, a few other silver-ranked disciples of The White Tiger Hall also walked over with unkind looks on their faces. However, they were all first grade great martial masters.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is still as overbearing as ever!”</p><p>At the side, some disciples from the other courtyards were watching and someone spoke up.</p><p>geniuses are all like this, but I think that going too far is as bad as falling short. Even if you are a genius, you should still be patient when you should, because a genius who has not grown up is just an ordinary warrior. If you are overbearing and act according to your own temperament, you will definitely suffer.</p><p>“You’re right. Lu Ming’s combat strength is indeed very strong. Even a first grade great Martial Master would be at a disadvantage against him. However, he can’t be a match for a second grade great Martial Master. He’s about to suffer.”</p><p>The people at the side were whispering.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you know why so many geniuses die so early? Because they didn’t know how to restrain themselves, they still acted high and mighty when facing an invincible opponent, so they died before they could grow.”</p><p>Senior brother du said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. nonsense. When facing an invincible opponent, of course I have to restrain myself. I’m looking for death in vain. Do I need you to tell me? ” But why should I restrain myself when I’m facing an opponent who can suppress me with a flip of his palm?”</p><p>The people in the surroundings were stunned. Lu Ming’s intention was clear. He could suppress Du Feng with a flip of his palm.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“I’d like to see how you’re going to suppress me with a flip of your palm!” Du Feng laughed from extreme anger.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Du Feng took a step forward and slammed into the ground like a heavy hammer. A violent boom was heard and the aura from his body burst out. It was heavy and powerful, like a mountain.</p><p>He was much stronger than a ninth grade master realm martial artist.</p><p>It could be said that a second grade great Martial Master could kill a group of ninth grade martial masters with a flip of his hand.</p><p>Du Feng’s hand glowed and a green long sword formed. It looked like it was made of green jade.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Du Feng’s sword slashed down at Lu Ming. The sword Qi whistled and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>he’s stronger than Jian wuchen!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>As expected of a second grade great Martial Master realm expert. Jian wuchen should be able to kill a first grade great Martial Master easily, but he was still not a match for a second grade great Martial Master.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not a ninth grade master now.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without even looking, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>His fist was wrapped in a layer of fiery red light, making it look like a ball of fire.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was unstoppable. Lu Ming’s punch directly destroyed Du Feng’s sword Qi and the combat sword condensed from essential Qi. He did not stop his fist and continued to attack.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>In an instant, Du Feng’s eyes widened and a look of disbelief flashed across his face. He then roared and exploded with all his strength. His figure rapidly retreated and his hand shone. A true spirit weapon sword appeared and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Tang Feng’s fist landed on the spirit weapon sword, and a violent force burst forth. Du Feng’s body was sent flying like a cannonball, smashing into a wall over thirty meters away. The wall was shattered, and a cloud of dust filled the air.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>The disciples of the four halls were so shocked that their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>One punch, just one punch and Du Feng was sent flying. He was no match for Du Feng at all. He was as weak as a little chick.</p><p>“This … How is this possible?”</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming has already broken through to the martial Grandmaster realm?”</p><p>“How can it be so fast? But that’s the only possibility, or else they wouldn’t be this strong. Geniuses like them can easily fight above their level after entering the martial Grandmaster realm.”</p><p>They had never heard of a ninth grade Martial Master sending a second grade great Martial Master flying with a single punch. They speculated that Lu Ming had entered the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Triangular-eyes was also dumbfounded. When he came to his senses, he was so scared that he was trembling.</p><p>In the shattered wall, Du Feng struggled to get up. His entire body was covered in dust and he looked as pathetic as he could be.</p><p>“Just you wait, Lu Ming. The White Tiger Hall has third grade or even fourth grade great martial masters coming. We’ll see,”</p><p>Du Feng threw out a vicious sentence and then left dejectedly.</p><p>It was too embarrassing, and he couldn’t stay for another second.</p><p>Triangular eyes also hurriedly followed Du Feng.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’ve become more powerful.”</p><p>Pang Shi walked over and said.</p><p>“Big rock, how many days have you been here? Let’s go, tell me about the situation.”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic.</p><p>“I’ve only been here for two days,”</p><p>The two of them arrived at a military camp. Pang Shi introduced the camp to Lu Ming.</p><p>According to pang Shi, the Dongyi tribe had attacked dongque city three days ago but retreated not long after. They had not continued their attack for the past two days.</p><p>“Big rock, when the battle starts, he can’t be impulsive.”</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>During the battle, tens of thousands of soldiers had charged at him. Pang Shi’s cultivation was indeed a little low. He was only a second grade master realm now.</p><p>“I know that. I just want to train myself. I won’t die in vain.”</p><p>Pang Shi said, scratching his head.</p><p>After that, he and pang Shi walked around the area.</p><p>In the military camp, the Army had already gone out to guard the place, so only the mystical sword sect disciples were left.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect had a special status. When there were no major battles, they were more casual and did whatever they wanted.</p><p>On the first day, everything was calm.</p><p>The next day, it was still calm. The Dongyi tribe didn’t make any moves.</p><p>In the past two days, the disciples of The White Tiger Hall did not come to cause Lu Ming any trouble.</p><p>On the third day of Lu Ming’s arrival.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Suddenly, the war drums sounded like Rolling Thunder that resounded throughout the camp.</p><p>“The Dongyi tribe is attacking. Let’s go and kill them.”</p><p>haha, my contribution points are here.</p><p>There were more than two thousand mystical sword sect disciples who had come over the past few days.</p><p>Most of them were bronze disciples, and a small number of them were silver disciples, about a hundred of them.</p><p>These few days, they had been holding it in for a long time. When they heard the war drums, they were all in high spirits and rushed in the direction of the city wall.</p><p>Lu Ming, pang Shi, and the rest also rushed towards the city wall. When they arrived at the city wall, the Army of dongque city was already fully armed. The bows and crossbows were already ready.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, in the distance, in the direction of the mountain range by the sea, a series of rumbling sounds suddenly came from the end of the earth, and the earth began to tremble.</p><p>Then, at the end of the earth, a dark cloud appeared.</p><p>No, those were not dark clouds, but demonic beasts.</p><p>There were countless demonic beasts. There were Tiger-shaped ones, Wolf-shaped ones, leopard-shaped ones, and all kinds of types. There were even flying-type ones.</p><p>On each demonic beast, there was one or two human figures.</p><p>They were from the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>There were at least tens of thousands of demonic beasts.</p><p>OWW! “Roar!”</p><p>Tens of thousands of demonic beasts gathered together, their roars shaking the sky. They galloped on the ground, and their murderous aura soared into the sky. They rushed towards East lacking city like a mountain.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
