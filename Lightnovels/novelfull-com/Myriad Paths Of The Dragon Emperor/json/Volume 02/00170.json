Boom! Boom!</p><p>In some places, there were even huge cracks on the ground.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Something’s not right!”</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect and the Dongyi people were all shocked.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>In the sky, wind and clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and Thunder rumbled. It was a scene of doomsday.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>Bolts of lightning that were thicker than one’s thigh lit up the sky.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a shocking scene. The space actually cracked open, and a hole appeared. It was pitch black inside, as if it led to the abyss of hell.</p><p>not good! This dimension is about to collapse!</p><p>go, go quickly, get out of this dimension. Otherwise, we’ll all die!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Everyone let out a cry of shock and rushed towards the door of light.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming has yet to come out. What should we do? ”</p><p>Chen Kuan shouted.</p><p>if he doesn’t come out in time, he’s dead. Who cares about him? go, go, go!</p><p>The leader of The White Tiger Hall’s young men shouted.</p><p>Everyone used all their strength and ran at high speed, wishing they had two more legs.</p><p>As they ran, the world trembled even more violently. The earth cracked and the space crumbled.</p><p>In the cave, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>this altar is the core of this plane. Now that the altar has collapsed, this small plane will also collapse.</p><p>The young girl said indifferently.</p><p>“What? Then let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically and he was about to rush out.</p><p>it’s too late to leave now. This cave mansion was built by a martial King realm expert. It’s covered with a large number of profound inscriptions. When the realm collapses, the inscription formation will automatically activate to protect it. People from the outside can’t enter, and people from inside can’t leave either.</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>“Can’t get out? Then aren’t we going to be trapped here until we die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was a little ugly.</p><p>The young girl smiled and squinted her eyes,”Yeah, I’m going to be trapped here for the rest of my life. Humph, I can’t get out now. It’s useless for you to take the beast soul. Give it back to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he fell into deep thought. After a long while, a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>It seemed that the girl had known in advance that the plane would collapse. Since she knew, she still dared to collect the beast soul in the altar and was so calm, she must have a way to get out.</p><p>At this thought, Lu Ming’s heart was set. He smiled and heaved a long sigh.”AI! There’s nothing I can do. If I’m really trapped here, it’s destined that I’ll have to face this calamity. I can only accept it!”</p><p>As he said that, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the young girl’s body and he praised, besides, it’s not bad to have such a beauty as a companion. If you feel bored, we can have a bunch of children to keep us company. What do you think? ”</p><p>Have a child? A pile?</p><p>The veins on the young girl’s forehead were already throbbing.</p><p>you’re despicable and shameless. In your dreams. Let me tell you, this plane won’t collapse completely. There’s a teleportation formation under the altar. Three months later, when the plane stabilizes, we can teleport out.</p><p>“You still want to have a child with me? bah! Bah! You’re dreaming!”</p><p>The young girl shrieked as she pointed at Lu Ming with a trembling finger.</p><p>“Oh? I can go out?”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The young girl realized that she had fallen into Lu Ming’s trap. She snorted coldly and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“AI! It’s a pity, a pity. Actually, if we really can’t get out, it’s not bad according to my idea.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Not bad, your head!”</p><p>The young girl gritted her teeth.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming could make use of the flame array in the passageway to greatly increase his combat strength, she would have taken him down and let him know the consequences of offending her.</p><p>However, she was not confident now. She could only tell herself that if there was a chance, she would teach Lu Ming a lesson in the future.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Heaven and earth continued to shake, and it was becoming more and more intense.</p><p>Outside the cave, the disciples of the mystical sword sect and the Dongyi tribe were running for their lives.</p><p>An hour later, everyone finally returned to the door of light that they had come in from.</p><p>Without any hesitation, everyone rushed into the light door.</p><p>When they reappeared, they had already returned to the nine demon mountain.</p><p>After returning to the nine demons mountain, everyone let out a long breath.</p><p>“I’m finally safe!”</p><p>A Dongyi man laughed.</p><p>“The two patriarchs haven’t come out yet!”</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>The Dongyi people fell silent and waited.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect did not leave either. They stood nearby, waiting to know the result.</p><p>Half an hour later, the door of light exploded with a bang.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>Someone from the Dongyi tribe shouted sorrowfully.</p><p>The light door had exploded, and the plane had collapsed. Under such circumstances, only a martial King could survive. Even a martial Grandmaster would die, let alone a Grandmaster realm warrior.</p><p>Those who didn’t come out were dead.</p><p>The atmosphere among the Dongyi people was heavy.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Chen Kuan sighed.</p><p>The other disciples of the mystical sword sect sighed as well.</p><p>Lu Ming, a genius who had created miracles time and time again ever since he entered the mystical sword sect, had fallen in this plane just like that.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>However, this was how the path of martial arts was. No matter how talented one was, if they didn’t grow up, they could fall in the future.</p><p>On the continent, there were countless peerless geniuses who died every year.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming is dead!”</p><p>The disciples of The White Tiger Hall laughed in their hearts, especially those from the Duanmu family.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>In the end, the mystical sword sect disciples and the Dongyi tribe didn’t continue their battle. Instead, they all rushed towards dongque city.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s death also spread like wildfire.</p><p>In the underground cave of the Dongyi ruins.</p><p>Lu Ming and the young lady waited quietly for an hour and a half. The tremors outside finally died down.</p><p>hey, how about this? you name a price, and I’ll buy those beast souls. What do you think? ”</p><p>The young girl looked at Lu Ming again, still thinking about the beast souls.</p><p>“I’m not selling!” Lu Ming still refused very straightforwardly.</p><p>These beast souls had been refined by a secret skill. At a critical moment, they could be fused with him and burst out with a powerful force. This was a life-saving item. How could Lu Ming be willing to sell it?</p><p>let me tell you, although this beast soul can increase your combat strength for a short time, you can’t use it with your current cultivation and physical body. If you fuse it with your body, you’ll definitely explode and die!</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about this.” Lu Ming was stubborn.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The young girl gritted her teeth.</p><p>In the end, he snorted coldly and turned around to leave.</p><p>hey, we’re going to spend so much time together. I can’t keep calling you ‘hey’, right? my name is Lu Ming. What’s your name? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The young girl stopped and turned around. remember, my name is Xie nianqing. This name will be your nightmare from now on.</p><p>With that, he turned around and left in a Huff.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
