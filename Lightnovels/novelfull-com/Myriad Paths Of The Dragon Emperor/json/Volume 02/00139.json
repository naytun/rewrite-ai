Eight kills of ancient jade-human kill!”</p><p>kill! Jian wuchen shouted. A terrifying killing intent spread out, accompanied by a terrifying sword light.</p><p>The sword light hit bu xingkai’s poisonous Dragon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The energy shot out in all directions, and the ground was hit by the powerful energy, creating a large pit. If the tables and chairs not far away were not blocked by some silver disciples and even the elders, they would have been smashed into dust.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a loud noise, bu xingkai’s spear flew out of his hand and into a fake mountain. He was forced to retreat more than 20 steps. Before he could stand still, a silver rank disciple from The White Tiger Hall appeared behind bu xingkai and blocked his way.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Bu xingkai’s expression changed rapidly. Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood and his hand trembled.</p><p>Everyone could see that his right sleeve was already tattered and his arm was covered in blood. Those blood marks were like tiny swords.</p><p>“What a domineering swordsmanship, what a domineering strength.”</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun, don’t let these soldiers do it. It’s a waste of my time. Let me see your strength.”</p><p>Jian wuchen asked Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Now, they could only rely on Zhang Muyun. Lu Ming, who was ranked first, was not here.</p><p>good. I’ve heard that the Qilin Hall recruits peerless geniuses, and most of them have special bloodlines. It’s true. I’ve always wanted to find a disciple of the Qilin Hall, but I couldn’t. Now, it’s time for me to have a taste of it.</p><p>Zhang Muyun stepped out, his eyes like lightning.</p><p>“Big brother mu Yun, be careful!”</p><p>Zhuo yirong said worriedly.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun smiled and walked to Jian wuchen.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun, make your move. Let’s see if you have the right to make me draw my sword.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said indifferently and confidently.</p><p>how arrogant! How can you not draw your sword when you’re facing Zhang Muyun? ”</p><p>“Zhang Muyun’s strength isn’t something others can compare to.”</p><p>Some of the disciples on the bronze rank were whispering to each other. They looked at Zhang Muyun with hope in their eyes.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was the only one who could save his honor on the bronze list.</p><p>Zhang Muyun smiled and didn’t care. However, the next moment, a sharp, overbearing, and all-conquering aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s expression changed for the first time. He muttered in disbelief,”This is …” Force, the force of gold!”</p><p>Behind them, the saber-wielding youth and the muscular youth’s expressions also changed.</p><p>“How is that possible? The trash of the four schools can actually comprehend control force at the master realm. Damn it, how is this possible?”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Even with his special bloodline, he hadn’t comprehended control force yet. It was hard for him to accept that a trash with a normal bloodline could.</p><p>Hmph, so what if he has a special bloodline? there are peerless geniuses with ordinary bloodlines. Some of them can even awaken the bloodline of an ancient divine beast, which is far beyond special bloodlines. What’s there to be arrogant about? ”</p><p>A genius on the bronze list said.</p><p>Seeing the shocked expressions on the faces of the Qilin Hall’s members, the surrounding spectators felt very pleased.</p><p>He finally had a chance to retort.</p><p>The knife-hugging youth and the strong youth’s faces turned gloomy.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think that just because you’ve comprehended the control force, you’re a match for senior brother Jian? You’re really naive.”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man snorted.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s expression changed a little, but he recovered and regained his confidence. He said, ” Zhang Muyun, you’ve exceeded my expectations. You’re qualified to make me draw my sword and you’re qualified to know my name. Remember, my name is Jian wuchen. You’ll never be able to surpass me in your life.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Jian wuchen finished speaking, a sharp and invincible aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Force, the force of metal!</p><p>Jian wuchen had also comprehended the force of gold.</p><p>“He … He had also comprehended the force of gold? How is that possible?”</p><p>“Is Qilin Hall all so strong?”</p><p>During the competition of the four courtyards, both Lu Ming and Zhang Muyun had displayed their dominance and shocked the four courtyards. Both of them were known as the mystical sword sect’s geniuses that only appeared once in a few years.</p><p>But now, a random young man from Qilin Hall had actually comprehended control force, which was quite a blow to them.</p><p>“I know, he must have a special sword bloodline. I heard that special bloodlines have all sorts of magical abilities. Some people can comprehend control force faster through their bloodline.”</p><p>A silver-robed elder said.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. A special bloodline was actually so miraculous?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two forces met in the air, and there was a sound of gold and iron hitting each other, and even sparks.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two sword hums resounded. Almost at the same time, the two of them pulled out their swords. Two resplendent sword Qi shot up into the sky. The cold and powerful sword Qi filled the entire sword dance courtyard.</p><p>The two figures turned into two sword lights and pounced at each other.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a loud boom, the sword Qi burst out wantonly. The ground was swept by the sword Qi, leaving a dense sword mark.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash, a few silver-robed elders appeared in front of him. An invisible force spread out and blocked the dense sword Qi.</p><p>“Four Seasons sword technique, the autumn wind blows!”</p><p>“Eight kills of ancient jade, heavenly kill!”</p><p>Two destructive sword lights met in the air. The two sword Qi merged into one and shot up into the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ground under their feet was hit by the sword Qi, and it sank deeply.</p><p>Clang! Clang! ‘Dang …’</p><p>What followed was a series of intense exchanges, and the two of them began an intense battle.</p><p>Everyone stared at the sky.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun, you’re going to win the moment you move.”</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to Zhang Muyun turning the tables.</p><p>not good. Zhang Muyun has already activated his bloodline, but Jian wuchen hasn’t.</p><p>Suddenly, a low voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Zhang Muyun had already activated his bloodline, which could be said to be his full strength, but Jian wuchen had not.</p><p>Even without the eruption of his bloodline, he was able to tie with Zhang Muyun. Jian wuchen gave people the feeling that he was unfathomable.</p><p>No one knew how much strength he had used.</p><p>Jian wuchen’s cultivation technique is definitely not yellow grade. It should be black grade. The genuine Qi cultivated by black grade cultivation techniques is more dense and condensed than yellow grade cultivation techniques.</p><p>A silver-robed elder explained to everyone.</p><p>moreover, his genuine Qi contains a very strong sword force. It’s like a sword, which should be an advantage of his bloodline.</p><p>The other silver-robed elder explained.</p><p>It was no wonder that Jian wuchen was so strong. His true Qi was stronger than Zhang Muyun’s.</p><p>Then, he felt a chill in his heart. How could he win against someone of the same level when he was so powerful?</p><p>Were the bronze ranking and the four great academies going to lose their reputation today?</p><p>it’s over. Ancient jade eight kills, godly kill!</p><p>Jian wuchen’s cold voice was heard. A ray of sword light was like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens, killing gods and demons.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
