Young master!”</p><p>The three core elders of the Lu clan were shocked.</p><p>Their young master had actually grown to this stage?</p><p>In their eyes, the Duanmu family’s expert was so powerful that he was invincible. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he was like a baby who could not fight back at all.</p><p>In their hearts, other than shock, there was still shock. They were unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p>“Three elders, please take care of my mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the three core elders.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three core elders said subconsciously.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Li Ping’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong must die. Mother, don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was condensed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not avoid it. He opened his mouth and sucked. The blood essence of the Duanmu family’s experts who had died in the courtyard flew out and gathered toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a few fifth and fourth grade Grandmaster realm martial artists among them. They were of great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Mother, I’m leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and leaped onto the big Eagle.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, be careful!”</p><p>Li Ping shouted.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head solemnly. He then stepped on the Condor. The Condor screeched and flew into the sky.</p><p>The Condor soared into the sky and the Lu clan disappeared in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming controlled the Condor and chased after Lu yunxiong and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura was rapidly declining.</p><p>The power of the beast soul was finally exhausted. Lu Ming had returned to his original level, but he felt a sharp pain all over his body.</p><p>This was caused by the impact of the beast soul’s power on his body.</p><p>“It’s a good thing I have the spirit-devouring bloodline, which devoured most of the power. Otherwise, with my current cultivation and physical body, I really wouldn’t be able to withstand it.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>After that, he continued to refine the power of his blood essence and started to recover his genuine Qi and repair his body.</p><p>Not long after, the blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>Among them, the blood essence of a few fifth grade Grandmaster experts was of great help to Lu Ming. His cultivation broke through to the peak of the second grade Grandmaster realm in one go.</p><p>As for his physical injuries, they had almost recovered.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on ning Kong’s corpse on the back of the Condor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Ning Kong was a ninth grade Grandmaster expert. His blood essence was definitely terrifying. Lu Ming did not want to miss it, but he did not dare to devour it rashly.</p><p>the blood essence of a ninth grade great Martial Master isn’t something I can devour and refine right now. I’m afraid my bloodline will explode if I devour it.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>There was a limit to how much blood a bloodline could devour.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that devouring experts who were three to four levels higher than him was already a little strenuous. His blood vessels would expand.</p><p>The blood essence of a ninth grade great Martial Master was equivalent to the blood essence of more than 60000 second grade great martial masters.</p><p>There were more than sixty thousand of them. It was too terrifying. Lu Ming guessed that if he devoured them, his blood vessels would explode from the violent energy.</p><p>forget it. I can’t be too greedy. I’ll just swallow a drop and see.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind. He then controlled his Blood Meridian and carefully devoured a drop of blood essence.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, it was as if a volcano had erupted in his Blood Meridian. Violent energy wreaked havoc. Lu Ming’s spirit-devouring Blood Meridian, which was originally in the shape of a small snake less than a meter long, swelled up at this moment.</p><p>Its length had increased by several times, and its thickness had also increased by ten times.</p><p>The energy was too terrifying.</p><p>Even if it was just a drop of blood essence, its energy was equivalent to the blood essence of more than 7000 second grade Grandmaster realm martial artists.</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. He controlled his Blood Meridian with all his might and started refining it crazily.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Streams of pure energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body. He circulated the true war Dragon technique continuously to absorb the energy and convert it into essential Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming controlled the blood Meridian and most of the energy essence was absorbed by the blood Meridian itself to improve the level of the blood Meridian.</p><p>Otherwise, the energy was too huge and Lu Ming would not be able to absorb it.</p><p>Only about 20% of the energy was converted into genuine Qi. The other 80% was used to upgrade the level of the bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was rapidly approaching the third grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming’s body shook. He had broken through to the third grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>After breaking through to the third grade Grandmaster realm, Lu Ming’s refining speed had increased greatly. There was a constant flow of energy being converted into essential Qi.</p><p>Early third grade great master realm, middle third grade great master realm …</p><p>When he reached the mid third grade great Martial Master realm, his soul-devouring bloodline let out a roar. Immediately after, the sixth blood-red chakra shone brightly.</p><p>His bloodline had advanced to the sixth level.</p><p>With a sixth-level bloodline, the devouring power was greatly enhanced, and the speed of refining blood essence was also greatly increased. The body of the spirit-devouring bloodline was slowly shrinking.</p><p>18 hours later, ning Kong’s drop of blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the third grade Grandmaster realm in one fell swoop. He was only one step away from the fourth grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Of course, this was because most of the essence had been used to improve the level of his bloodline.</p><p>This also caused Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian to rise to the peak of level six. His six Meridian cycles were bright and full, as if a new Meridian cycle could be born at any time.</p><p>The higher one’s bloodline level was, the more blood essence one would need to advance. However, Lu Ming’s bloodline had advanced by an entire level this time. One could only imagine how terrifying the blood essence of a ninth grade Grandmaster was.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at ning Kong’s corpse. He felt that it was a pity.</p><p>Half a day had passed, and the essence of ning Kong’s blood essence had dissipated.</p><p>The higher a martial artist’s cultivation, the slower the dissipation of their blood essence after death. However, for a ninth grade great Martial Master, the essence of their blood essence would dissipate in three hours at most.</p><p>Genuine Qi burst out, and ning Kong’s corpse fell down.</p><p>With one less person, the Condor’s speed increased greatly, and it quickly chased forward.</p><p>A few hours later, he could see a black dot in the distance.</p><p>It was Lu yunxiong and the others.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming has caught up with us.</p><p>Clearly, Lu yunxiong had also noticed Lu Ming and was so shocked that he cried out.</p><p>“This little b * stard still dares to chase after me? is his beast soul power still there? How is that possible?”</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family had a dark expression.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, I’ve told you that you’re going to die. You can’t escape.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his voice was extremely cold.</p><p>“What do we do? Elder Chao, what do we do?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong mumbled, frightened out of his wits.</p><p>could it be that the power of this little bastard’s beast soul really hasn’t dissipated? or, he still has another beast soul? ”</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family was called Duanmu Chao. He was deep in thought as he looked at Lu Ming behind him with fear in his eyes.</p><p>“There’s no need to rush. We’re almost at the mystical sword sect. Once we reach the sect, Lu Ming, that little bastard, won’t be able to do anything to us. At that time, he’ll be the one to die instead of us!”</p><p>Duanmu Chao said with a dark expression.</p><p>It would take about ten days to get from fiery wind city to the mystical sword sect on a green scale horse, but it would only take about a day to get there by riding the Condor.</p><p>And now, they were only a few hours away from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
