After walking in, they found that it was a small cave, which should have been excavated by someone.</p><p>Inside, there was a stone bed, a stone table, and a few stone stools. Other than that, there was nothing else.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and was a little disappointed. He walked out of the cave and went to another cave.</p><p>There was still nothing to be found in the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and walked out.</p><p>He saw Xie nianqing walking out from another cave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you. From today onwards, half of it belongs to me and the other half belongs to you. You’re not allowed to step into the caves I’m in. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite. Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hand and drew a line in the middle.</p><p>“Fine, I won’t go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eccentric temper was something he had learned from experience.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, Xie nianqing turned around and walked into a cave in a Huff.</p><p>“Take a look at that storage ring and those two secret manuals.”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion. He could not be bothered with Xie nianqing. He turned around and walked into a cave. He sat cross-legged on a stone bed.</p><p>With a single thought, he appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He moved his hand and the storage ring appeared in his hand.</p><p>this is a storage ring left behind by a martial King. What’s inside? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation. He had an idea to enter the storage ring to take a look.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>His mind couldn’t enter because it was blocked by a layer of inscriptions.</p><p>There were inscriptions on the storage ring that were extremely powerful and prevented others from peeking.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Then, he wailed in his heart, this can’t be played like this, right? It was not easy to get a martial King realm storage ring, but he could not open it.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and held the storage ring in his hand. He circulated his essential Qi and wisps of essential Qi gushed toward the inscription on the storage ring like a dragon.</p><p>With a swish, the genuine Qi dissipated, but the inscriptions did not move at all.</p><p>“It’s been so many years, but the inscriptions are still so strong,”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Then, he continued to channel his true Qi.</p><p>Similarly, the genuine Qi dissipated, but the inscriptions remained.</p><p>“My cultivation is too weak, I can’t open it at all. Eh, no, the inscription is slightly weakened.”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He sensed it carefully and found that the inscriptions on the storage ring had weakened a little.</p><p>Although it was only a trace and could be ignored, it showed that Lu Ming’s essential Qi had some effect on the storage ring.</p><p>As long as there was an effect and he persevered, he would be able to open it sooner or later.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming roused his spirits and continued to channel essential Qi.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming was sweating profusely and panting heavily.</p><p>However, the inscriptions on the storage ring had only been weakened by a tiny bit, probably only one-ten-thousandth.</p><p>sigh, it seems like I can only grind it slowly in the future. As my cultivation improves, I will weaken the inscription and speed up the process. This is the storage ring of a martial King. It is worth the effort.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Now, let’s take a look at the two secret manuals.”</p><p>He took out two secret manuals and started reading.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed when he opened it.</p><p>The first book was called ancient shield technique, and it was a low level earth grade defensive martial skill.</p><p>It was actually an earth level martial arts technique, and it was a rare defensive martial arts technique. Lu Ming could not help but be delighted.</p><p>One had to know that in the mystical sword sect, an earth grade high level martial skill was the most top-notch martial skill. It was the sect’s most important martial skill, and ordinary people had no right to cultivate it.</p><p>&Lt; ancient shield technique &gt;, earth grade low level. After successfully cultivating it, one would be able to form an ancient shield to protect themselves.</p><p>At the first stage, one could form an ancient shield.</p><p>At the second level, one could form two ancient shields.</p><p>And so on, when one cultivated to the sixth level, they would be able to condense six ancient shields.</p><p>Moreover, the ancient shield could be controlled and stacked on defense at will.</p><p>Even though it was similar to the defensive martial skill that Duan gang cultivated, its might and profoundness were many times stronger.</p><p>“If I can cultivate this martial technique, how strong will my defense be?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning.</p><p>This was an earth grade martial skill, and its power was much greater than a profound grade martial skill.</p><p>As long as one cultivated the first stage of an earth grade low level martial arts technique, its power would be comparable to the sixth stage of a black grade high level martial arts technique.</p><p>Its power was simply unimaginable.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current black level low grade martial arts technique had not even been cultivated to the sixth stage of the fire gun technique, let alone the sixth stage of the black level high grade martial arts technique.</p><p>After finishing the ancient shield technique, Lu Ming started to read another book.</p><p>[ Three Palms ], a low Earth grade martial skill.</p><p>It was another low level earth level martial arts technique. Lu Ming’s heart was beating wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and was envious of the power of the three Palms.</p><p>Which one should he cultivate?</p><p>Although the power of a low Earth level martial skill was extremely strong, the difficulty of cultivating it was equally terrifying.</p><p>Now that there was no chanting, Lu Ming’s speed of understanding the martial arts technique would definitely slow down. It was impossible for him to cultivate two books at the same time. He could only choose one to try.</p><p>“Let’s train the” ancient shield technique “first. In terms of attack, I have the” fire gun technique,”and I haven’t trained it to the highest level yet, so there’s no rush.”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind to cultivate the ancient shield technique first.</p><p>After that, he put away the manual and started to study the in detail.</p><p>The earth level martial arts technique was extremely mysterious. Lu Ming had spent a few hours but still could not figure out the way.</p><p>“No rush, no rush. An earth rank martial skill is definitely not that easy to cultivate. I just need to spend some time every day to slowly comprehend it.”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly warned himself.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s essential Qi had almost fully recovered.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked to the third platform. He placed nine spiritual crystals on the stone platform.</p><p>Soon, a figure was formed.</p><p>“Let the training begin!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and rushed toward the figure.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two figures continued to bombard each other.</p><p>In the process of the battle, Lu Ming constantly looked for the shortcomings in his martial arts techniques and made up for his weaknesses.</p><p>Such a battle made rapid progress.</p><p>When his essential Qi was exhausted, Lu Ming stopped. He pondered on the ancient shield technique while he recovered his essential Qi.</p><p>A few days passed by in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that every time he put in nine spiritual crystals, the figure could only last for six hours before it disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming had made great progress in the continuous fierce battles. His martial arts technique had improved significantly.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and came to the passage. He fought with the flame spirit and comprehended the force of fire.</p><p>Every day, Lu Ming had a full schedule and strived to improve his ability as soon as possible.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also hiding in the opposite cave, probably cultivating.</p><p>Just like that, a month passed.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>In that passage, Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and more than ten flame spirits were swept away and exploded in the air.</p><p>the fire gun controlling art has finally reached perfection. I’ve reached the sixth level, human and martial arts as one!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened and his lips curled into a smile.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
