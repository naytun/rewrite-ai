Even if I die, I won’t let you have your way!</p><p>Li Ping berated.</p><p>“B * tch, what’s the use of you hanging on? Your husband is dead. Now, that little b * stard Lu Ming is dead too. I want all of you to die for opposing me!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong berated.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense. My son, Lu Ming, will never die!”</p><p>Li Ping shouted.</p><p>“Won’t die? Don’t lie to yourself, he’s already dead, you have no one to rely on. ”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed coldly as he attacked Li Ping.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>Li Ping’s body trembled, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>Although she did not admit it, she knew very well that Lu Ming had really met with an accident.</p><p>The mystical sword sect had specially sent someone to announce it, so how could it be wrong?</p><p>She was in despair.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, aren’t you afraid of being punished by the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect for what you’ve done?”</p><p>One of the core elders shouted.</p><p>“Haha, punishment? When Lu Ming was alive, he was indeed a peerless genius and was valued by the mystical sword sect. But now that he’s dead, who would punish me for a dead person?”</p><p>besides, you should’ve seen that everyone here is from the Duanmu family. Why would the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect punish the Duanmu family? what a joke!</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed maniacally.</p><p>The other men from the Duanmu family also laughed out loud.</p><p>“What a pity, what a pity. It’s a pity that Lu Ming the little bastard is dead. Otherwise, I’ll kill his mother in front of him and let him have a taste of losing a loved one.”</p><p>Ning Kong said coldly.</p><p>bah, shameless man. Like Father Like Son. Look at you. No wonder your son died at Ming ‘er’s hands!</p><p>Li Ping glared at ning Kong and said in disdain.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Ning Kong was furious. He said to Lu yunxiong, ” brother Lu, I don’t think we should wait any longer. Let me do it now and torture this b * tch. I want her to suffer a fate worse than death. At that time, she will agree to whatever conditions you have.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, let’s do this! We don’t have that much time to waste here.”</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family who was sitting on the armchair opened his eyes.</p><p>“Good! I’ll leave this person to you, brother ning. You can do whatever you want with him, and use whatever methods you have.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong sneered.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, what are you guys doing? Are you even human to treat the Lu family like this?”</p><p>A core elder of the Lu family bellowed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, ning Kong moved and struck the core elder with his palm.</p><p>Ning Kong was a ninth grade Grandmaster realm expert and a core elder of the Lu family. How could he withstand the attack? his body was pierced through by the powerful palm force and he flew out. He stopped breathing.</p><p>“You old fogeys, you’re looking for death by chirping here!”</p><p>Ning Kong said coldly.</p><p>“You guys … You’ll all die a horrible death. Lu yunxiong, you’ll receive your retribution.”</p><p>The other three core elders shouted.</p><p>Now, only three of the seven core elders of the Lu family were left. The rest had been killed by the Duanmu family two days ago.</p><p>“Shut up, you old fogeys. I wanted to spare your lives, but it seems like there’s no need for that now. Attack and kill them all.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Around them, a few of the Duanmu family’s men unsheathed their sabers and were about to attack.</p><p>At this moment, a bloodied man ran in.</p><p>“It’s bad, it’s bad!”</p><p>The burly man shouted.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The burly man exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by his words.</p><p>“What Lu Ming? Lu Ming is already dead.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong said.</p><p>no, he’s not dead. He’s not dead. He’s entered the place.</p><p>The burly man shouted, his eyes flashing with fear.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong and the others were shocked.</p><p>As for Li Ping, the three core elders were stunned for a moment before they were overjoyed.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, Ming’ er didn’t die! Ming ‘er didn’t die!”</p><p>Li Ping mumbled to herself and cried tears of joy. Her tears kept falling and she was so excited that her entire body was trembling.</p><p>haha, the young master didn’t die. I knew it. The young master is a genius. How could he die? ”</p><p>The core elder of the Lu clan laughed.</p><p>“Impossible, how is that possible?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong roared.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible.”</p><p>A cold shout came from the sky, and a young figure stepped on the void. His body was as light as nothing, and he actually floated in just like that.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>it’s really him! He really didn’t die!</p><p>Exclamations of shock came from the crowd.</p><p>“Haha, it’s really the young master!”</p><p>The three core elders laughed.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>Li Ping was extremely excited.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really him!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong and ning Kong growled in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look at the others. He took a few steps forward and landed in front of Li Ping like the wind.</p><p>Looking at Li Ping’s pale and weak face, Lu Ming’s heart throbbed with pain. His eyes reddened as he said,”Mother, your son has come late, and has made you suffer.”</p><p>“Ming ‘er, Ming’ er, is that really you? Mother thought that she would never see you again.”</p><p>Li Ping touched Lu Ming’s face, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Initially, she really thought that Lu Ming had died and her heart was filled with despair. Now, Lu Ming was standing in front of her alive and well. This kind of joy was indescribable. She seemed to have recovered a lot of energy.</p><p>“Mother, take this pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pill that could replenish blood and Qi and let Li Ping consume it.</p><p>Li Ping took the medicinal pill, but her expression changed drastically as if she had recalled something. She said,”Ming ‘er, leave quickly. Don’t worry about mother, leave quickly!”</p><p>“Leave? Since you’re already here, you still want to leave? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s voice was cold.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around slowly. His expression was cold and his eyes were icy. His gaze swept across Lu yunxiong, ning Kong, and the other members of the Duanmu family. He said coldly,”All of you will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was extremely strong. He had never felt such strong killing intent towards a person.</p><p>A Dragon had a reverse scale, and anyone who touched it would be killed!</p><p>To Lu Ming, his family was his weak spot.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you still want to kill us? what a joke!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed.</p><p>kill him! Lu Ming must be killed. Kill him and we’ll pretend that he didn’t appear today and died in the Dongyi ruins.</p><p>The old man sitting on the armchair stood up and coldly said.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to return to the mystical sword sect, it would be difficult for them to take action.</p><p>He might as well kill Lu Ming today and pretend that he had not appeared and died in the Dongyi ruins. This way, the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect would not find out as long as they did not send anyone to investigate.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s good that you’re not dead. Today, I’ll kill the person closest to you in front of you and let you have a taste of the pain of losing a loved one. Haha!”</p><p>Ning Kong laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really stupid. If I were you, I’d run back to the mystical sword sect. How dare you show up here so openly? You’re the one who’s looking for death.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
