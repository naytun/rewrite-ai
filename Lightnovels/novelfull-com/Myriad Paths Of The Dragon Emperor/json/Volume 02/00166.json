They could smell each other’s breath.</p><p>A delicate fragrance wafted into Lu Ming’s nose. He could not help but Twitch his nose and take a few deep breaths.</p><p>The girl’s face turned red, and her eyes were filled with anger and killing intent. She said coldly, ” “If you don’t want to die, quickly let go!”</p><p>How could Lu Ming agree? “Unless you put away your dagger, don’t think I’ll let you go!” He pouted.</p><p>“I’ll keep the dagger first? Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The young girl shouted angrily.</p><p>“Oh? Forget it then, it’s pretty good like this anyway, soft jade and fragrant, not bad, not bad, it’s also pretty good to stay like this.”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“You’re shameless!” The young girl was embarrassed and furious.</p><p>“You still dare to scold me? do you believe that I will bite you? You.”</p><p>Lu Ming grimaced in pain.</p><p>no, wait, wait!</p><p>The young girl finally couldn’t take it anymore and screamed.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>“How about this, we both let go. I will put away the dagger and he will let go of your hand. How about it?”</p><p>The young girl said helplessly, her heart clenched.</p><p>Lu Ming was really despicable.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement. After all, it was not a solution to go on like this.</p><p>“I’ll count to three, two, one, and we’ll both let go!”</p><p>The young girl was overjoyed to see Lu Ming nodding.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>When the young lady shouted ‘one’, the dagger in her hand disappeared and Lu Ming released her throat.</p><p>At this moment, a cold glint flashed in the young girl’s eyes. The muscles all over her body trembled. Her seemingly petite body burst out with an unparalleled power. At the same time, she clasped her arms and grabbed Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“I knew you would be like this!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted. The muscles in his body bulged, and at the same time, the essential Qi in his body burst out. He grabbed the young girl’s hands with both hands.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s legs clamped around the young girl’s waist.</p><p>Instantly, the two of them fell to the ground and wrestled with each other. They were competing in the burst of their physical strength and true Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the young lady’s physical strength was extremely strong, far exceeding his. Moreover, the cultivation technique that the young lady cultivated was also extraordinary. The condensation and richness of her essential Qi were far beyond that of an ordinary martial artist. However, there was still a gap between her and Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>Therefore, the combination of physical strength and essential Qi made Lu Ming and the young girl almost on par. It was difficult to tell who was superior.</p><p>However, after a long time, Lu Ming still had the upper hand.</p><p>In the end, the young girl finally admitted defeat. She was completely defeated as she shouted, ” “Let go of me. I swear I won’t do anything to you. We’ll each take half of the secret manuals here. If I go back on my words, I’ll never improve my martial arts again. I’ll die of Qi deviation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. To a martial artist, this oath was heavy enough. Moreover, martial artists valued oaths very much. This was because if one did not abide by the oath they had made, it was very likely that it would leave a knot in one’s heart, which would be very disadvantageous to their future cultivation.</p><p>“This is more like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming then let go of his hand. The young girl also let go of her hand and let go of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming crawled a few meters away and lay on the ground, panting heavily.</p><p>The battle just now was even more tiring than an intense battle of life and death.</p><p>The young girl was the same. She panted heavily, but her beautiful eyes glared at Lu Ming fiercely, as if she wanted to bite him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He shouted, ” Hey! You swore it yourself. Don’t forget it.</p><p>The young lady’s combat strength was indeed above his. Furthermore, his bloodline had already erupted. If they were to fight again, he would not have the ability to create the situation he had just created.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The young girl’s eyes flickered. In the end, she gritted her teeth and let out a cold Humph. She did not continue to attack.</p><p>The two of them glared at each other while circulating their cultivation techniques to recover their true Qi.</p><p>Two hours later, both of them had recovered their physical strength and true Qi at the same time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them flashed at the same time and rushed towards a stone pillar, beginning to bombard the light rings on the stone pillar.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>The young girl seemed to have released all her anger onto the light ring, erupting with a powerful attack. The light ring in her hand exploded in no time.</p><p>The young girl collected the secret manual in the ring of light and threw it at the next ring of light.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached terribly. There were six stone pillars in total. The young girl had already destroyed the Halos on two of them, and Lu Ming had obtained a secret manual.</p><p>There were only three books left. Now, there was one less book. Lu Ming could only get two books at most.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming bombarded the ring of light with his long spear. After dozens of shots, the ring of light shattered and Lu Ming kept the secret manual inside the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He looked over at the young lady and saw that she had just shattered another light ring and obtained the secret manual inside.</p><p>There were six stone pillars and six secret manuals. The young girl took four of them and Lu Ming got two.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
