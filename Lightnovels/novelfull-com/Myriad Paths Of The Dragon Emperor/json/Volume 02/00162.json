The heavens are helping us.</p><p>The Dongyi people shouted in excitement.</p><p>alright, now that the formation at the entrance has been broken, let’s go in together!</p><p>The skinny black-robed man said in a low voice.</p><p>The two fifth grade great master realm elders looked at each other. Their eyes flashed and they nodded.</p><p>“Senior, please leave the ruins and return to the Army of the East lacking city.”</p><p>One of the old men said.</p><p>The skinny black-robed man seemed to be stunned for a moment, then he said, ” “What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>senior, this is the ancestral land of the Dongyi tribe. You are an outsider. It is not good for you to go in!</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>“I understand, you guys are burning the bridge after crossing it!” The skinny black-robed man’s voice became even more hoarse and low.</p><p>“That’s wrong. How can you say that I’m burning the bridge after crossing it? We just need you to return first. Once we obtain the treasures left behind by our ancestors, you’ll naturally be rewarded.”</p><p>An old man from the eastern wasteland sneered.</p><p>haha, you’re right. I’ve realized that you Dongyi people are really despicable. This time, if I didn’t provide you with the clues and the formation patterns to break the formation, how could you have known where the entrance to your ancestral remains was? How can you break this formation?”</p><p>also, I left some men behind to help you block the geniuses of the mystical sword sect. I’ve done my best, but you’re going back on your word just as I’m about to succeed. I must be blind.</p><p>The skinny black-robed man laughed in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>An Eastern Barbarian old man shouted coldly. His face darkened. you did make a contribution this time. I’ve already said that you’ll get something out of it. Besides, the people you sent to stop the mystical sword sect disciples were useless. The mystical sword sect still caught up and caused great losses to the Dongyi tribe. I haven’t settled this with you yet.</p><p>also, don’t think that I don’t know your cultivation level. I’m just being polite by calling you senior. Don’t be insensible. Otherwise, let’s not talk about benefits. You might not even be able to leave.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the other Dongyi Masters stepped forward and surrounded the thin black-robed man. They looked at him with hostility.</p><p>what an ungrateful bunch. No wonder the Dongyi tribe declined. But do you think I didn’t have a backup plan? ”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man sneered. The next moment, he suddenly moved. He was as fast as lightning and pounced on a first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>This time, it was so fast that the man’s throat was grabbed by the thin black-robed man before he could react.</p><p>With the influx of genuine Qi, the Dongyi man’s body became soft and powerless. The skinny black-robed man grabbed his throat. The skinny black-robed man dodged several times and broke out of the encirclement, retreating to the center of the stone pillar.</p><p>“What are you doing? If you don’t want to die, let him go.”</p><p>A fifth grade great master realm Eastern wasteland elder roared and pounced on the skinny black-robed man.</p><p>But at this moment, the skinny black-robed man condensed a black long sword in his hand. He swung the long sword and the head of the Dongyi man fell to the ground, blood splashing everywhere.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man’s genuine Qi gushed out. The blood was driven by his genuine Qi and formed into strands of blood, falling on the stone pillars and the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than 100 stone pillars suddenly began to shake, emitting a bright light.</p><p>Then, the light from the 100 stone pillars gathered together, forming a light pillar as large as a mountain that shot into the sky.</p><p>The light beam was so bright that it could be seen from hundreds of miles away.</p><p>At this moment, hundreds of miles away, Lu Ming was running through a mountain forest when he suddenly saw a light pillar soaring into the sky in the distance.</p><p>“What’s that? Could it be that some rare treasure has appeared? let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and dashed in the direction of the light pillar.</p><p>At the same time, the other mystical sword sect disciples also saw the pillar of light from different places, and they also made their way toward it.</p><p>In the light pillar area.</p><p>“Haha, if you want to leave me behind and take everything for yourself, then let the disciples of the mystical sword sect come as well. Let’s see if you can kill all of them.”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man let out a hoarse laugh.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Dongyi people were furious.</p><p>“I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>A fifth grade great Martial Master elder roared and continued to pounce on the skinny black-robed man.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground began to shake. Then, beams of blood-red light shot out from the ground and headed toward the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Someone from the Dongyi tribe screamed as he was pierced by the blood light.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was shocked to find that the blood light was actually blood-colored vines.</p><p>The vine was as thick as a finger. It rushed out of the ground and wriggled crazily, trying to wrap around the Dongyi experts.</p><p>The burly man who was pierced by the vine let out a shrill scream. He used his genuine Qi and tried to break free, but the blood-colored vine was so hard that he couldn’t break free. It kept wriggling as if it was sucking the Dongyi man’s blood.</p><p>The Dongyi man’s body shriveled up at a visible speed.</p><p>The blood-snake vines absorbed the blood and became even crazier. They kept twisting and attacking the others.</p><p>There were a few hundred of them, a huge number.</p><p>“Hahaha, you guys enjoy it!”</p><p>The skinny black-robed man was extremely fast. His skinny figure flickered and dodged the blood-colored vines as he rushed toward the wolf-like mountain peak.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s kill our way over!”</p><p>An Eastern Barbarian old man roared.</p><p>But then, a few more Dongyi men were wrapped by the blood-red Vines. The vines pierced their skin and devoured their blood.</p><p>those below the third grade great Martial Master realm, retreat. Those above the third grade great Martial Master realm, charge with us!</p><p>A fifth grade great Martial Master elder shouted.</p><p>Immediately, the Dongyi tribe split into two groups. The ones with lower cultivation levels left the stone pillar while the ones with higher cultivation levels charged in together.</p><p>……</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming was running at high speed. He covered a distance of hundreds of miles in just half an hour.</p><p>“What a strange mountain!”</p><p>As he neared, Lu Ming saw the wolf-shaped mountain peak at first glance.</p><p>It was the first time he had seen such a strange mountain peak.</p><p>Intense battle cries could be heard from the front. When Lu Ming arrived, he saw two groups of people fighting.</p><p>One group was the mystical sword sect’s disciples, such as Chen Kuan, and the other disciples from the other halls. It seemed that they were closer to this place and had arrived earlier than Lu Ming.</p><p>The other group was of course the Dongyi tribe, but they didn’t have many masters. They were all below the third grade of the great Martial Master realm and were no match for the disciples of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The Dongyi people who were third grade great Martial Master and above were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Let’s retreat first!”</p><p>The Dongyi tribe saw that they were no match for the enemy and retreated, leaving behind a few corpses.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
