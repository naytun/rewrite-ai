His body was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He was the Golden Wolf killer of the shadow Wolf Pavilion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, two figures, as fast as lightning, sprinted towards the mountain peak.</p><p>When he arrived in front of the man with the Golden Wolf mask, he knelt down.</p><p>“What’s going on? Where are the others?” The man with the Golden Wolf mask said coldly.</p><p>“Sir, the rest of them are dead. They were killed by Lu Ming. The information we received is wrong. Lu Ming is not half crippled!”</p><p>One of the Silver Wolf assassins said.</p><p>“Not crippled? Then, can he still use beast souls?”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer asked.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Although he killed so many of our people, Lu Ming’s injuries are definitely not light. Under such circumstances, he did not use his beast soul. I think he must have used up all his beast souls.”</p><p>One of the Silver Wolf killers speculated.</p><p>good, there’s no beast soul. That’s good. Lu Ming is dead for sure. The two of you, come with me to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer ordered.</p><p>Previously, he did not attack together with Lu Ming as he was afraid that Lu Ming still had beast souls on him. Hence, he sent someone to test him first.</p><p>Now that it was confirmed that Lu Ming did not have a beast soul, he was about to make his move.</p><p>“Yes!” The two silver Wolf killers responded.</p><p>The three figures disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming was refining the blood essence with all his might.</p><p>Fortunately, most of the injuries he had suffered were external injuries, so they were relatively easy to treat.</p><p>When the blood essence turned into rolling energy and was refined by Lu Ming, his injuries healed rapidly. His muscles squirmed and the wound began to heal. Soon, Lu Ming’s wound had begun to scab.</p><p>This was also because Lu Ming’s physical body had reached complete grade two, which was why he could be so fast. Ordinary people would definitely not be able to be so fast.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered and his cultivation level had improved.</p><p>I’m afraid the shadow Wolf Pavilion won’t give up so easily. They’ll definitely send more people to hunt me down. I can’t take the main road to the imperial capital. I’ll travel along the barbaric mountains, where I can kill demonic beasts and improve my cultivation. I can also practice my martial arts.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>After that, he left the Supreme shrine, concealed his aura, and walked along the forest towards the imperial capital.</p><p>However, not long after, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure coming from afar.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of light shot through the air.</p><p>Within the light was a man wearing a Golden Wolf mask and a black robe.</p><p>a martial Grandmaster powerhouse, the Golden Wolf killer of the shadow Wolf Pavilion!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The Golden Wolf killers of the shadow Wolf Pavilion were all powerhouses above the martial arts Grandmaster level. Lu Ming could not defeat them at all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Lu Ming used his midair steps to its maximum and ran madly into the depths of the forest.</p><p>“Hehehe, Lu Ming, I don’t know what method you’ve used, but you’ve been hiding for two days. Now, you finally can’t hide anymore and have appeared. Let’s see where you can run to this time!”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer let out an ear-piercing sneer.</p><p>Lu Ming ran wildly. He stepped on the trees and his body shot forward like a bolt of lightning. He was as fast as a Phantom.</p><p>However, the Golden Wolf killer was a martial arts Grandmaster powerhouse. He could walk in the air at a speed that was beyond the scope of mortals. Lu Ming could not shake him off at all.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi pierced through the void and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>It was fast, ruthless, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>“Dodge, I have to Dodge!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. His body kept changing and he barely dodged the sword.</p><p>However, he was also hit by the sword edge, and a part of his sleeve disappeared.</p><p>“You actually dodged my sword. What about now?”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer sneered and waved his sword.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>There were more than a dozen sword Qi, and each of them was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and an ancient shield appeared.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword Qi struck the shield, causing it to shake violently before exploding.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was also sent flying back dozens of meters, crashing into a big tree that was large enough for a person to wrap his arms around.</p><p>At this moment, the sound of air being torn could be heard. Two figures were approaching at extreme speed. They were the two silver Wolf killers.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you won’t be able to escape this time!”</p><p>One of the Silver Wolf killers laughed.</p><p>Shadow Wolf Pavilion, I don’t care who you are. As long as I, Lu Ming, am alive, I’ll destroy the shadow Wolf Pavilion!</p><p>Lu Ming growled, turned around, and continued to run into the depths of the forest.</p><p>“You still want to destroy my Shadow Wolf Pavilion? How naive.”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer sneered and continued his pursuit in the sky.</p><p>Behind the Golden Mask, a cold gaze was revealed. He was looking for an opportunity to kill in one strike.</p><p>For a genius like Lu Ming, even someone as powerful as him did not dare to show the slightest neglect. Otherwise, he would most likely be the one who suffered.</p><p>“It’s at this moment …”</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer’s eyes suddenly lit up. The sword in his hand glowed, and a bright and sharp sword Qi pierced out.</p><p>The Golden Wolf killer had used all his strength in this strike, and it was unbelievably fast.</p><p>Moreover, it seemed that he had already calculated Lu Ming’s running route. It was as if Lu Ming was going to crash into the sword aura directly.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating rapidly and the hair on his body stood on end. At this moment, he could feel the aura of death. It was as if the Grim Reaper was pointing a sickle at him.</p><p>“I can’t Dodge it. Block it. I must block this sword. I can’t die yet!” He thought.</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His eyes were bloodshot. In an instant, the power of his Blood Meridian burst out. At the same time, an ancient shield appeared.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear forward. The tip of the spear emitted a bright light, as if there was a bright star at the tip of Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>A terrifying fluctuation burst out. This was the strongest move that Lu Ming could cast at the moment, and it blasted toward the sword Qi above his head.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a ray of white light flew out from the depths of the forest. Like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens, it also blasted towards the Golden Wolf killer’s sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack combined with the white light and collided with the Golden Wolf killer’s sword aura.</p><p>Violent energy shot out in all directions, and the trees, flowers, and grass in the mountain forest were instantly crushed to pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a strong surge of energy and his body flew back dozens of meters.</p><p>However, it had also blocked the Golden Wolf killer’s attack.</p><p>“Who helped me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Who is it? You dare to block me, are you looking for death?” The Golden Wolf killer roared.</p><p>In the depths of the mountain forest, a white figure flashed out.</p><p>The person who came was actually a young woman in a white dress. Her skin was like jade, and she was extremely beautiful.</p><p>Seeing this woman, Lu Ming was shocked. He could not help but blurt out, ” “Xie nianqing, it’s you!”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes flickered as she looked at Lu Ming and shouted, ” “Come with me!”</p><p>With that, her figure flickered, like a fairy from the nine Heavens, and she ran into the depths of the forest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he quickly followed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
