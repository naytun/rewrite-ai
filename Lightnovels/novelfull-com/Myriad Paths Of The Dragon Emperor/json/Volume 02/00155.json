The other party initially thought that Lu Ming wanted to rush towards the light door with all his might. He did not expect that he would turn around and attack.</p><p>In a hurry, he slashed out with his saber in an attempt to block.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered coldly. He was pretending to run forward just now. What he really wanted to do was to take the opportunity to accumulate power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent energy exploded from the tip of the spear and blasted towards the other party.</p><p>In his haste, the other party was unable to block it at all and was sent flying backward, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the lightning pursuit technique and was even faster when he used it with the midair steps. It pierced through the Dongyi man’s throat.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his Blood Meridian and devoured the middle-aged man’s blood essence in an instant.</p><p>The other party was a fourth grade great Martial Master, and the essence in his blood essence was extremely rich. It was constantly refined by the spirit-devouring bloodline to replenish the true Qi that he had lost from using the explosion technique.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He ran towards the door of light. At that moment, many mystical sword sect disciples had already rushed in.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>A few first and second grade Grandmaster realm Dongyi experts wanted to stop him, but Lu Ming swept his long spear and they coughed up blood as they were sent flying.</p><p>After a few breaths, Lu Ming was close to the door of light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, save me!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry for help came from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around. It was Du Feng. He was surrounded by a few Dongyi tribe Masters.</p><p>“You’d better solve it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, turned around and walked towards the light door. Du Feng’s desperate roar could be heard from behind.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the light door, he felt the world spin around him. When he recovered, Lu Ming found that he was standing on a rocky ground. Behind him was a stone wall. On the stone wall, there was another light door, exactly the same as the previous one. However, the surrounding environment had changed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A saber ray was aimed at Lu Ming. Lu Ming waved his long spear and blocked the saber ray.</p><p>All around, there was still the sound of fighting.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect rushed in, but so did the Masters of the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>charge forward! We’ll charge into the forest in front of us. As long as we can get into the forest, we won’t have to be afraid of them.</p><p>A fourth grade great Martial Master disciple of the mystical sword sect shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll cover the rear!”</p><p>Chen Kuan shouted.</p><p>“You want to leave? All of you, stay!”</p><p>The two fifth grade great Martial Master realm elders attacked with full force.</p><p>The five fourth grade great Martial Master realm young men from the mystical sword sect resisted with all their might to buy time for the others.</p><p>Although the competition between the four halls was usually intense, and it was normal for them to fight with each other, they were still disciples of the mystical sword sect. At this moment of life and death, they knew very well that only by working together could they survive. If they fought on their own, they would only die.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body was surging. The blood essence of the fourth grade great Martial Master was being refined continuously, turning into turbulent energy that surged into Lu Ming’s body and was constantly transformed into essential Qi.</p><p>The essential Qi that Lu Ming had expended when he cast the explosion earlier was recovered in a few breaths. The remaining majestic energy was helping Lu Ming to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Lu Ming fought while he tried to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A second grade Grandmaster from the eastern wasteland was so shocked by Lu Ming that he coughed out blood and almost exploded.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s body trembled, and his cultivation broke through to the middle of the first grade great master realm.</p><p>The blood essence of a fourth grade great Martial Master was too thick. It was equivalent to the blood essence of at least seventy to eighty first grade great martial masters. Lu Ming’s cultivation was still rising rapidly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear, and no one was his match. He rushed toward Chen Kuan and the others.</p><p>“Little bastard, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>An elder from the Dongyi tribe charged at Lu Ming. He was also a fourth grade Grandmaster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, after exchanging a blow with Lu Ming, he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>The Dongyi elder was shocked.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Since he had a lot of essential Qi in his body, Lu Ming was not afraid of wasting it. He cast another explosion.</p><p>With the breakthrough of his cultivation, this move was even more powerful. One of the elder’s arms was blown off and he was almost killed.</p><p>He wanted to retreat in fear, but Lu Ming was faster. He stabbed him with his spear and at the same time, he controlled his Blood Meridian to devour his blood essence.</p><p>“Kill him first!”</p><p>A fifth grade Grandmaster elder from the eastern wasteland was shocked and furious. He charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming used his midair step and did not bother with him. In a few flashes, he had rushed to Chen Kuan and the rest.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Lu Ming leaped high into the air and smashed his spear at the other fifth grade Grandmaster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was an earth-shattering explosion. Lu Ming’s body was hit and he flew backward.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After being blocked by Lu Ming, Chen Kuan and the rest finally managed to free themselves and ran wildly toward the forest in front of them.</p><p>Lu Ming did not linger in the battle either. He ran towards the forest.</p><p>“Chase, chase!”</p><p>The Dongyi people roared.</p><p>More than a hundred people continued to chase after Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>In just over five minutes, Lu Ming and the rest had arrived at the mountain forest.</p><p>In the mountain forest, ancient trees towered into the sky, and old vines curled around them. It was incomparably dense, and it was a scene of a primeval forest.</p><p>The rest of the mystical sword sect disciples had already rushed in. Lu Ming and the rest did not hesitate at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Running in the dense forest would allow them to hide well, and at the same time, the other party would not be able to form a good encirclement.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The Dongyi people stopped in front of the forest.</p><p>The combat strength of the mystical sword sect’s disciples was extremely shocking, and they had many tricks up their sleeves. Just now, the two fifth grade great Martial Master realm experts had joined forces with a few other fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts, but they were actually unable to stop the five fourth grade great Martial Master realm young men. They had only managed to injure a few of them.</p><p>In the end, a first grade great Martial Master had even killed a fourth grade great Martial Master. This had frightened them greatly. It could be said that the strength of the mystical sword sect wasn’t much weaker than theirs. If they rushed into the forest, they would most likely be ambushed.</p><p>let’s not care about them for now. Let’s find the treasures left behind by our ancestors and leave this place as soon as possible. We’ll hide in the depths of the coastal mountains. Even the mystical sword sect won’t be able to do anything to us.</p><p>A fifth grade great Martial Master elder suggested.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that.”</p><p>After their discussion, they left and headed deeper into the forest.</p><p>In the forest, Lu Ming and the rest were running at high speed. They stopped after running for about ten miles.</p><p>“It seems that the Dongyi people didn’t come after us.”</p><p>Chen Kuan said.</p><p>His face was a little pale. Clearly, he had been injured in the battle just now.</p><p>The others were not in a good state either. They had also suffered some injuries.</p><p>After all, the other party had two fifth grade great Martial Master realm experts. It was already good enough that they could hold them back for a short time.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding mystical sword sect disciples slowly gathered around.</p><p>In the end, only 61 people were left.</p><p>When they arrived, there were 102 people.</p><p>Now, there were a total of 41 people missing.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
