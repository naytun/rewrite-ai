Lu Ming, you bastard! Why aren’t you stopping? Duanmu yunchong has already been defeated. Why are you still not stopping? ”</p><p>“That’s right. If you don’t stop, you’ll be breaking the rules.”</p><p>“Breaking the rules?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Duanmu yunchong did not die. He did not admit defeat. How am I breaking the rules? ”</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The people from the Duanmu family were furious, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Next, he sent Duanmu yunchong flying with another spear strike.</p><p>At this moment, the four principals had different expressions.</p><p>The deans of the Black Tortoise Hall and the Azure Dragon Hall gloated and watched the show.</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster’s expression was extremely dark, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The happiest person was, of course, the Vermillion Bird Hall’s director. He scratched his beard with all his might and grinned.</p><p>Carefree, this was too carefree.</p><p>“Admit defeat! Duanmu yunchong, quickly admit defeat!”</p><p>“Admit defeat!”</p><p>The disciples of The White Tiger Hall shouted.</p><p>However, Duanmu yunchong was already in a daze. How could he call out?</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the trigger a few more times before Duanmu yunchong fell heavily to the ground. His entire body was convulsing. White foam and blood were mixed in his mouth and kept flowing out.</p><p>His skin and flesh were split open, and more than a dozen bones were broken.</p><p>Of course, this was the result of Lu Ming deliberately controlling his strength. Otherwise, he would have been whipped to death with one shot.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on Duanmu yunchong’s body and looked down at him.</p><p>Duanmu Yun only regained his senses after rushing for a long time. He was scared out of his wits when he saw Lu Ming in front of him. Like a young girl who had been defiled, he shrunk his body and shrieked,”Don’t, don’t, don’t hit me!”</p><p>As he shouted, snot and tears flowed down his face. He was really scared of being slapped.</p><p>When the spear hit his body, the pain was simply soul-deep.</p><p>“Didn’t you want me to suffer ten times worse than Liu Hui? What, where did the awe-inspiring presence from before go?”</p><p>Lu Chang looked at Duanmu yunchong and said indifferently.</p><p>“No, no, I won’t dare to do it again! Just take it as I’m farting!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong shouted.</p><p>“Hahaha …”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong’s appearance made everyone burst into laughter.</p><p>The Duanmu family’s disciple’s face was extremely dark. This was too embarrassing.</p><p>“Duanmu yunchong, hurry up and admit defeat!”</p><p>Someone from the Duanmu family shouted.</p><p>“I admit defeat, yes, I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong shouted.</p><p>It inevitably caused another round of laughter.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Duanmu yunchong has already admitted defeat. Why don’t you move your foot away?”</p><p>Someone from the Duanmu family called out.</p><p>“Oh? Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, moved his leg, and suddenly kicked.</p><p>Duanmu yunchong let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying dozens of meters away. He rolled dozens of times on the fighting ring before coming to a stop.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? Duanmu yunchong has already admitted defeat, yet you still attacked. You have already broken the rules. We must capture you and punish you according to the sect’s rules.”</p><p>A silver rank disciple of the Duanmu family roared.</p><p>“Foul? You must have misunderstood. Just now, it was Duanmu yunchong who was blocking my feet. When I lifted my foot, he was sent flying. It’s all his fault. Why did he lie by my feet for no reason?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>The disciple of the Duanmu family trembled in anger. He felt as if he was suffocating and almost spat out blood.</p><p>Previously, Duanmu yunchong had treated Liu Hui in the same way. Now, Lu Ming had used it all on Duanmu yunchong. It was really difficult for them to refute him.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re really too much. You’re not even careful when you walk. You must be more careful next time! Ahaha!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall principal stroked his beard and laughed heartily.</p><p>The disciples from the other halls were speechless when they saw the Vermillion Bird Hall chief laughing. Wasn’t your carefreeness too obvious?</p><p>“This battle, Lu Mingsheng!”</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Mighty senior brother Lu!”</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu is invincible!”</p><p>At this moment, the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were so excited that they were trembling. They could not hold it in any longer and started screaming madly.</p><p>It felt good, too good.</p><p>It was like drinking a glass of cold beer in the middle of the summer. It felt so good that it went straight to the bone.</p><p>Previously, Duanmu yunchong had been so arrogant. But now, he was like a dead dog.</p><p>It was simply too satisfying.</p><p>In particular, pang Shi, Hua Chi, Feng Wu, and the others were flushed with excitement.</p><p>At this moment, the people from The White Tiger Hall had already carried Duanmu yunchong away.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to turn and leave, a deafening roar rang out from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw a young man in a fiery red robe looking at him with a cold expression.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang, that’s Duanmu Yunyang. He was the newcomer King three years ago. What is he doing?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Information about Duanmu Yunyang appeared in his mind.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang, the new disciple King three years ago, was now ranked second on the bronze ranking.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was being suppressed by Zhang Muyun, who was in the same batch as him. It was difficult for him to get first place.</p><p>Some people said that Zhang Muyun was the true king in that episode. Duanmu Yunyang had only won the title because of the number of members in the Duanmu family.</p><p>“Why? Is there anything I can help you with?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really bold. Perhaps you don’t know how big of a mistake you’ve made!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you better pray that you don’t meet me later on. Otherwise, I’ll make you lose very badly! It’s very ugly!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang coldly said. He especially emphasized the words ‘very ugly’.</p><p>The disciples of the Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, and Vermillion Bird halls were all shocked.</p><p>Especially the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, their faces were even uglier.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang had his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Duanmu Yunyang was being suppressed by Zhang Muyun, it was undeniable that his combat strength was extremely powerful. He was almost invincible among his peers.</p><p>There were even rumors that Duanmu Yunyang had once defeated a first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>This was crossing a major realm, not a small level. The strength of his battle prowess could be said to be terrifying.</p><p>No one would think that Lu Ming was Duanmu Yunyang’s match.</p><p>Perhaps it would only be possible after a year or two.</p><p>But now, it was impossible.</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and Hua Chi were all worried.</p><p>Pang Shi was the only one who was waving his arms and shouting that he believed in Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? I wish I could meet you. I want to see how you’re going to make me lose so badly. Don’t be like Duanmu yunchong, who only knows how to clamor.”</p><p>yes, ” Lu Ming replied indifferently and domineeringly.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Lu Ming wanted to challenge Duanmu Yunyang. Where did he get the guts to do so?</p><p>In the Azure Dragon Hall area, a man and a woman stood side by side.</p><p>Among them, the man was wearing a blue robe. He had a slender figure, black hair hanging down loosely, sword-like eyebrows, and Eyes Like Stars.</p><p>He was just casually standing there, but he had an extraordinary aura, like a king on patrol.</p><p>He was Zhang Muyun, ranked first on the bronze rank.</p><p>Next to him was an extremely beautiful woman. She was Zhuo yirong, who was ranked seventh on the bronze rank.</p><p>brother mu Yun, what do you think of Lu Ming? ”</p><p>Zhuo yirong asked.</p><p>he’s extremely talented and a Dragon among men. However, he’s still young and full of youthful vigor. In two years, he’ll be a great opponent for me!</p><p>Zhang Muyun smiled.</p><p>“It’s rare for you to think so highly of me, big brother mu Yun, but isn’t it great to have a worthy opponent in life?” Zhuo yirong asked, a little surprised.</p><p>“Yi Rong, you know me best.”</p><p>Zhang Muyun said with a smile.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
