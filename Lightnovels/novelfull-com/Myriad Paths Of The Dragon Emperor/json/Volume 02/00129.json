There was nothing that it couldn’t break.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s spear technique combined with the force of fire. It was overbearing and destructive.</p><p>Both of them were the representatives of attacks and had extremely strong offensive power. Naturally, there was nothing fancy about the battle. They fought openly and wildly like a storm.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards and the elders in the stands stared at the arena without blinking, staring at the two figures in the fierce battle on the fighting ring.</p><p>For those who were not strong enough, they could only see two figures fighting on the fighting ring. They could not see the exact situation of the battle.</p><p>Ding, ding, ding, ding …</p><p>In a few breaths, the two had exchanged dozens of moves, and the hot sparks flew everywhere. This kind of soul-shaking battle made everyone forget to breathe, and their faces were red.</p><p>The explosions became more and more frequent, and the two of them fought faster and faster, their battle more and more intense.</p><p>wonderful, this is simply wonderful.</p><p>“You saw the details of their fight?”</p><p>“It’s exciting because I can’t see it clearly.”</p><p>The insiders looked at the tricks, while the outsiders watched the fun.</p><p>Some of the disciples with lower cultivation bases watched with great interest, while some of the disciples with higher cultivation bases watched with a serious expression.</p><p>“Sect leader, who do you think will win?”</p><p>A golden-robed elder asked the sect leader of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The mystical sword sect leader smiled and said, ” both of them have just comprehended their Shi not long ago. They’re both at the beginner level, so it’s hard to tell who’s stronger. Zhang Muyun’s physical body and martial arts technique are stronger than Lu Ming’s, but Lu Ming’s cultivation technique is no small matter. His essential Qi is rich and condensed, which is stronger than Zhang Muyun’S.</p><p>“But from what I understand, Zhang Muyun has more than one black level martial arts technique, and Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian has not erupted either. However, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian is very peculiar, and it seems like it can only erupt for a few breaths. Hence, it’s hard to predict the outcome of this battle.”</p><p>“The two of them are both people with profound fortune, each with their own opportunities.”</p><p>A gold-robed elder sighed.</p><p>After so many battles, the unique characteristics of Lu Ming’s essential qi and blood could not be hidden from the eyes of the sect leader and the Golden-robed elder of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>However, in the world of martial Dao, everyone had their own opportunities. This was very normal. With their status, they naturally would not covet the opportunities of a few juniors.</p><p>They were even happier when their disciples had opportunities. This way, the sect would become even stronger in the future.</p><p>I can’t win. Lu Ming must not win!</p><p>Lu Yao and Lu yunxiong’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. They kept screaming in their hearts, hoping that Zhang Muyun would win.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Zhang Muyun had exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>more than a minute has passed. There’s less than a minute left before Zhang Muyun’s bloodline power burst.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Two-handed sword doctrine!”</p><p>At that moment, a long sword appeared in Zhang Muyun’s other hand.</p><p>He held a long sword in each hand and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Two-handed sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Not only him, but everyone else was also shocked.</p><p>Two-handed swords were not something that just anyone could master. It could be said that only those with extraordinary talent could master it. Two-handed swords. The power of two swords working together was even stronger.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh …</p><p>The entire sky was filled with sword shadows that were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>there’s actually such a move. Let’s decide the winner.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. Then, there was a flash of blood and his Blood Meridian exploded.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Taking advantage of his Blood Meridian eruption, Lu Ming cast his strongest move.</p><p>The true Qi in his body rushed toward the long spear and gathered at the tip of the spear. It condensed into a point and then exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>There was a violent explosion, followed by the rapid sound of metal clashing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure flew out. It was Zhang Muyun. He was panting heavily, and a part of his sleeve had disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming stood where he was, panting heavily. Using the explosion consumed a lot of essential Qi. However, he was unscathed.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Everyone in the audience stared at the fighting ring with their hearts in their mouths.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Muyun sighed.</p><p>“What? Zhang Muyun admitted defeat? Could it be that the victor had already been decided? I think they’re both fine.”</p><p>are you blind? didn’t you see that part of Zhang Muyun’s sleeve was shattered? geniuses like them don’t need to be injured to determine the winner. One move, or even half a move, would be enough to determine the winner.</p><p>I see. Oh my God, isn’t lu Ming the first place this time? ”</p><p>that’s right. He’s a Dark Horse, but he’s a Dark Horse too. He’s a Dark Horse all the way to the end.</p><p>Before the start of the competition, no one had expected that Lu Ming would come in first.</p><p>Most of the people felt that it was already very shocking that Lu Ming could enter the top thirty.</p><p>No one would think that Lu Ming would get first place, not even in their dreams. Almost everyone thought that the first place would be between Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>But the truth made everyone’s jaws drop.</p><p>impossible, impossible!</p><p>Lu Yao and Lu yunxiong were dumbfounded.</p><p>I can’t let this go on. I can’t let Lu Ming continue to develop. If this goes on, there will be no place for me in the future. I must think of a way to kill him!</p><p>After recovering from his shock, Lu yunxiong’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the winner of this battle.”</p><p>The judge announced loudly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The crowd instantly boiled over, especially the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, who were screaming madly.</p><p>“Lu Ming is invincible!”</p><p>“Long live Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, I love you!”</p><p>……</p><p>All the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, regardless of gender, started to scream.</p><p>It was no wonder they were so crazy.</p><p>All these years, the Vermillion Bird Hall had always been at the bottom of the four halls and had been ridiculed by the other halls. It was impossible to say that they didn’t feel sullen.</p><p>But now, a new disciple from the Vermillion Bird Hall had won the bronze level competition. This was an honor for the entire Vermillion Bird Hall. They felt like they had won and could hold their heads up high. Naturally, they went crazy.</p><p>Among them, pang Shi, Feng Wu, and the others were the loudest.</p><p>Lu Ming walked down the Coliseum with a smile.</p><p>Naturally, he was surrounded by a group of Vermillion Bird Hall disciples. Some female disciples, in particular, were trying their best to squeeze themselves onto Lu Ming. Although Lu Ming was not a gentleman, he was still embarrassed.</p><p>It took her a lot of effort to squeeze to Mu Lan’s side.</p><p>hey, you guys are too disloyal. Why didn’t you come and help me!</p><p>Lu Ming was sweating profusely. It was more tiring than having a big battle.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the most popular person in the Vermillion Bird Hall now. It feels good, right?”</p><p>Mu Lan seemed to be smiling yet not.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
