Hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Duanmu Chao’s zhenqi burst out and surged into the Condor’s body. The Condor shrieked as if it had been stimulated by something. It sped up and rushed forward.</p><p>The two eagles, one in front and one behind, were about ten thousand meters apart as they quickly flew towards the mystical sword sect.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, as there was one less person, their speed was faster. The distance between them was slowly closing.</p><p>However, it was still impossible to catch up to him in a short time.</p><p>Soon, three hours had passed.</p><p>The distance between them was only about two thousand meters. However, they were already close to the mystical sword sect’s territory.</p><p>“Haha, we’re almost there. We’re finally almost there. Lu Ming, you still want to kill me? dream on!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed hysterically.</p><p>However, the killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes did not diminish and was still extremely strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Soon, the mountain Gate of the mystical sword sect was in sight.</p><p>The Eagle screeched and flew over the mystical sword sect’s Mountain Gate, heading toward The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not show any signs of stopping. He continued to give chase.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why hasn’t lu Ming stopped?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong was a little confused.</p><p>it’s fine. He’s just bluffing. Lu Ming won’t dare to mess around when we get to The White Tiger Hall!</p><p>Duanmu Chao said confidently.</p><p>One after the other, the two eagles flew past the mountain Gate of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Then who’s on the Eagle?”</p><p>“The one in front seems to be the chief elder of The White Tiger Hall.”</p><p>the one behind him looks familiar. Wait, Lu Ming. It’s Lu Ming!</p><p>“Lu Ming? What? Lu Ming! It’s really Lu Ming. Oh my God, Lu Ming is not dead!”</p><p>“It’s really him. Lu Ming is not dead!”</p><p>Instantly, the entire mystical sword sect was in an uproar, and the news spread like wildfire.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, I don’t care where you run to. I’ll kill you today.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice, filled with killing intent, reverberated throughout the front mountain of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“This is bad. Senior brother Lu Ming is going to kill the people of The White Tiger Hall. By the looks of it, he’s going to kill all the way to The White Tiger Hall. No, I have to tell pang Shi, Feng Wu, and the others about this. I’ll have them inform elder Mu Lan.”</p><p>A few of the Vermilion bird’s disciples ‘expressions changed drastically as they rushed toward the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>In front of them, Lu yunxiong and Duanmu Chao were riding on a huge Condor, quickly heading towards The White Tiger Hall. They were about to arrive.</p><p>Lu Ming was in hot pursuit a thousand meters behind.</p><p>The sight of two huge eagles flying above the mystical sword sect without restraint naturally caused a commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming isn’t dead. He’s in hot pursuit of the chief elder of The White Tiger Hall and threatened to kill Lu yunxiong. Who’s Lu yunxiong? ”</p><p>“You’re so ignorant, right? Duanmu Lin’s fiancée, Lu Yao, you should know her, right? Lu yunxiong is Lu Yao’s father, and I’ve also heard that Lu Yao and Lu Ming are from the same clan.”</p><p>I see. But how is it possible that Lu Ming is chasing after a chief elder? ”</p><p>I don’t know, but something big is definitely going to happen. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Below the mystical sword sect, a large group of people gathered and headed towards The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu yunxiong and Duanmu Chao arrived at The White Tiger Hall first. The huge Eagle landed on a huge square in The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>As soon as it landed, the Condor began to foam at the mouth and twitched on the ground.</p><p>Along the way, this large Eagle had burned its potential and finally could not hold on any longer.</p><p>Lu yunxiong and Duanmu Chao jumped down and stood on the square.</p><p>The two of them felt much more at ease when they arrived.</p><p>“Haha, we’re finally safe.”</p><p>Lu yunxiong was overjoyed. He looked like he had not recovered from the shock. He had really been scared out of his wits by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Lu Ming won’t dare to make a move here even if he has ten more guts. I’ll report this to The Dean and I’ll personally bring people to take Lu Ming down. He’s killed so many people from the Duanmu family. No one can save him.”</p><p>Duanmu Chao put his hands behind his back and returned to his calm expression.</p><p>The White Tiger Hall was the Duanmu family’s headquarters. Who would dare to come here and kill?</p><p>Unless he didn’t want to live.</p><p>He was certain that Lu Ming was about to stop.</p><p>Lu Ming really stopped. He drove the big Eagle and floated in the air above the square.</p><p>“Impudent! Lu Ming, you’ve killed dozens of my Duanmu family’s men, and now you’re driving a Condor into the White Tiger Hall? you’re so audacious and sinful! Get down on your knees and beg for mercy right now, and I might leave you with an intact corpse.”</p><p>Duanmu Chao chided with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, come on. Didn’t you want to kill me? If you have the ability, come down and kill me, haha!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong laughed out loud and looked at Lu Ming with contempt.</p><p>But the next moment, the smile on his face froze.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had jumped down from the Condor and landed heavily on the square with a loud boom. He stomped on the stone slabs on the square and crushed them, sending gravel flying.</p><p>you don’t have to shout. I’ve said it before, I’ll definitely kill you. It’s useless no matter where you hide.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Lu yunxiong, step by step.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, what are you doing? How dare you! This is The White Tiger Hall!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s expression changed drastically. He couldn’t help but take a few steps back as he shrieked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely cold. He only said one word,”Kill!”</p><p>how arrogant! Men, Lu Ming has killed dozens of people from the Duanmu family. He’s gone mad and has lost his mind. Let’s attack together and kill him!</p><p>Duanmu Chao could no longer remain calm as he roared.</p><p>There were many people from The White Tiger Hall in the square. At that moment, one of them rushed over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming! He’s not dead!”</p><p>“I don’t care if he’s dead or not. How dare he kill so many of my Duanmu family’s people? he didn’t die before, but he’s dead now.”</p><p>“Attack and kill him!”</p><p>Some of them were silver-rank disciples of The White Tiger Hall, while some were middle-aged men. They had been cultivating for many years, and most of them were at the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Those in the master realm didn’t dare to rush over.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the demon subduing spear in his hand. His aura was wild, and his long hair fluttered in the wind. He shouted coldly,”My target is Lu yunxiong and the other man. If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</p><p>“Arrogant! Let’s see what you can do!”</p><p>“He’s just a bronze disciple. In my eyes, he’s nothing.”</p><p>A few silver rank disciples shouted.</p><p>These people were all fifth grade great martial masters, and some of them were even sixth grade great martial masters.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent exploded. He shook the demon subduing spear and a beast soul fused into his body.</p><p>The second beast soul at the peak of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s aura increased crazily, like a demon.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The long spear swept out, and a spear light as thick as a water bucket and as long as 100 meters appeared, sweeping away thousands of soldiers.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Dozens of White Tiger Hall disciples were sent flying. A dozen of the weaker ones had their bodies blasted apart.</p><p>In an instant, more than a dozen great martial masters were killed.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Some of The White Tiger disciples who did not rush forward gasped, their eyes almost popping out.</p><p>One spear, just one spear, killed more than a dozen martial Grandmaster realm experts, and more than a dozen were seriously injured. It was too powerful.</p><p>how audacious! How audacious! Lu Ming massacred his fellow disciples. He’s going to rebel.</p><p>A disciple from The White Tiger Hall shouted.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, it’s none of your business. If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his aura was wild.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
