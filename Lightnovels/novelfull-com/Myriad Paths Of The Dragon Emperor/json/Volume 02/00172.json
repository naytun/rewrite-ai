He had reached the sixth level, human and martial arts as one. Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by another level.</p><p>As for his Fire Force, it had also improved a lot, and he was getting closer and closer to small success.</p><p>Unfortunately, the progress of the ancient shield technique was still quite slow. There was still a big gap to the first level.</p><p>However, he was still improving in all aspects.</p><p>Lu Ming roused his spirits and continued cultivating.</p><p>The fire gun control technique had been perfected. Next, Lu Ming put more energy into the ” ancient shield technique ” and the force of fire.</p><p>He spent most of the day fighting the flame spirit in this tunnel.</p><p>His comprehension of the force of fire was advancing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>On the third platform of the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming was engaged in a fierce battle with a blurry figure.</p><p>That figure had completely replicated Lu Ming’s combat strength. No matter how much Lu Ming improved, the other party would improve as well.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, the fiery Tung spear was like a fire Dragon. It danced in the air and exploded with great power.</p><p>The space kept exploding.</p><p>“There’s a flaw!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. His long spear was as fast as lightning, piercing towards the other party’s right shoulder.</p><p>Just as the tip of the spear was about to Pierce into the man’s shoulder, a light suddenly flashed on the man’s body. A 1.5-meter long and one-meter wide shield was formed. The shield looked very ancient and was bronze in color. It looked like the shield used by the ancient ancestors in the War.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear struck the shield, creating a loud boom.</p><p>Lu Ming shot with all his might, but the shield did not move at all. The huge force caused Lu Ming’s long spear to bend.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, the other party also thrust his spear at Lu Ming. It was as fast as lightning and it was too late to Dodge.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>With a single thought, an ancient shield that looked exactly the same as the other party appeared in front of Lu Ming. The other party’s spear stabbed into the shield but it did not move at all.</p><p>This was the ancient shield technique. After two months of hard work, Lu Ming had finally succeeded in cultivating it two days ago. He had reached the first level and could condense an ancient shield to protect himself.</p><p>The earth level martial arts technique was indeed an earth level martial arts technique. Its power was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations. Even if he used all his strength, he could not break through it at all.</p><p>With the ancient shield technique, as long as there was someone with similar battle strength to him, he could simply stand in an undefeatable position.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the figure both cast the ancient shield technique. They completely ignored each other’s attacks and attacked each other wildly.</p><p>“Even if it’s an earth rank martial skill, it should have its weakness, it’s impossible for it to be without any flaws. What I need to do is to find the flaws of the ancient shield technique in the battle with myself. This way, my comprehension of the ancient shield technique will be greatly accelerated.”</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear that the figure condensed on the third platform had the same combat strength as him. As long as he kept trying to defeat him, his martial arts technique would continue to improve.</p><p>“The force of fire is just a little bit away from the initial success. I feel that it won’t be long.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright.</p><p>Lu Ming felt extremely refreshed as he was improving in all aspects.</p><p>What could be more satisfying than watching yourself get stronger and stronger?</p><p>The battle continued. Lu Ming only stopped when the six hours were up and the spiritual energy of the spirit crystal was almost exhausted.</p><p>Holding a piece of spiritual crystal in both hands, Lu Ming started to recover.</p><p>With the appearance of the spirit devouring bloodline, the spirit energy in the spirit crystal was devoured and refined by the bloodline in the blink of an eye, turning into Lu Ming’s essential Qi. Not long after, Lu Ming’s essential Qi was restored and even improved.</p><p>A few days ago, Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved and he had reached the middle of the second grade Grandmaster realm.</p><p>After his essential Qi had recovered, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine. He planned to take a stroll in the cave and relax.</p><p>When they arrived at the cave, Lu Ming could not help but look at the cave where Xie nianqing was.</p><p>It had been two months. Xie nianqing had been hiding in the cave and had not come out. Moreover, Lu Ming could vaguely hear the sound of running water.</p><p>“What’s in that cave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s curiosity was overflowing and he decided to take a look.</p><p>He retracted his aura and approached carefully.</p><p>When they arrived at the entrance of the cave, the sound of running water became even clearer.</p><p>great, so there really is water. I haven’t had a drop of water for a month.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes emitted a burning glow.</p><p>Even though he had brought some water with him in his storage ring, he had already used it up a month ago.</p><p>In this one month, he hadn’t had enough water.</p><p>With his cultivation, it would be fine even if he didn’t drink water for half a year because he could absorb the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth to replenish his energy. However, it was still very uncomfortable.</p><p>He tiptoed in and a River came into view.</p><p>Yes, a River. There was actually an underground river here. It was five to six meters wide, and the river water was trickling. No one knew where it flowed to.</p><p>How was this a cave? it was clearly another huge underground cave.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Strange, where did Xie nianqing go?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the underground river and looked around curiously.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>who cares? she might be cultivating in another cave. I’ll take a shower first!</p><p>Lu Ming had not taken a bath for two months and he felt that his body was going to stink. At this time, he saw an underground river and suddenly felt itchy all over.</p><p>Lu Ming took off his clothes in no time.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, the water in the river in front of Lu Ming splashed and a figure emerged from the water.</p><p>Wasn’t that Xie nianqing?</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing came out of the water, she saw a man standing in front of her. She was stunned as well. Her eyes widened and she stared at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A moment later, a deafening scream came from the cave.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming also came to his senses. He picked up his clothes and put them on in no time.</p><p>Xie nianqing, on the other hand, sank to the bottom of the river. After a few breaths, she came back up again. The difference was that she was wearing a long dress.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>Xie nianqing shrieked and charged at Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>While in the air, he struck out a few palm strikes in succession. A few strong palm prints blasted towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Third grade great master realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Obviously, Xie nianqing had made a breakthrough in his cultivation in the past two months.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take it head-on. Instead, he used his midair step and dodged Xie nianqing’s palm.</p><p>After two months of cultivation, his midair steps had also improved to the fourth level.</p><p>“Don’t even think about dodging!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and struck out six palm strikes in a row. All at once, six demonic palm prints flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“So strong, he’s become stronger again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised.</p><p>In the past two months, he had been improving, and so had Xie nianqing.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
