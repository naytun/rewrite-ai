He did not know why the young lady was walking toward the altar.</p><p>The young girl walked to the side of the altar and circled around it, carefully sizing it up.</p><p>Sometimes he observed carefully, sometimes he frowned in thought, and then he smiled.</p><p>Just like that, after half an hour, the girl began to inscribe the inscription.</p><p>The young lady’s slender fingers began to move in the air. Her fingertips contained true Qi, and as she moved them in the air, a strange pattern appeared.</p><p>This was an inscription, and the girl was inscribing an inscription.</p><p>“Carving runes in the air, what a brilliant technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>Even though he didn’t know much about the Dao of inscription, he still had some basic knowledge.</p><p>Generally speaking, it was not possible for a martial Grandmaster to carve an inscription in the air.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared in the air and flew toward the altar.</p><p>On the stone altar, the ancient patterns seemed to come to life, emitting a faint Halo.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>A moment later, the young girl shouted and waved her hands, sending inscriptions into the altar.</p><p>Soon after, the sacrificial altar buzzed and emitted rays of light that were extremely bright.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, the roar of a beast came from the altar. A fierce tiger rushed out of the altar and leaped into the air.</p><p>The Tiger was three meters tall and six meters long. It stood in the air and roared into the sky. It was majestic and a powerful aura spread out.</p><p>“A beast soul, what a complete beast soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to see this.</p><p>This fierce tiger didn’t have a physical body, but it looked like it had a physical body. This was definitely a beast soul left behind by an extremely powerful demonic beast, and it was very complete.</p><p>“Heavenly demonic soul condensing technique, take it!”</p><p>The girl shouted, and her whole body emitted a black light. Her hands formed a series of strange seals, and then, a black light shrouded the Tiger beast soul.</p><p>The Tiger beast soul roared continuously. A strong pressure filled the cave, pressing down on Lu Ming’s heart like a mountain.</p><p>“What a powerful beast soul! This beast soul was extremely powerful when it was alive. It must be a rank 4 demonic beast, and not an ordinary one at that.”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Tiger beast soul roared, but it was useless. It turned into a ray of light and was put away by the girl.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>After the Tiger beast soul was put away, the altar roared again, and a giant black Wolf appeared in the air.</p><p>Just like the Tiger beast soul from before, this giant wolf was also a beast soul. Judging from its aura, it was not any weaker than the Tiger beast soul from before.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>As soon as the beast soul of the giant wolf appeared, another cry was heard, and a giant snake more than 30 meters long appeared in the air.</p><p>Another beast soul.</p><p>There were so many powerful beast souls sealed in this stone altar.</p><p>hehehe, the real treasures are here. These are all beast souls of half-step King realm. They were refined by the ancestors of the Dongyi tribe with a secret technique. They are complete. If you merge them with your body, you can burst out with great power. It’s a pity that you can’t take them. Only I can.</p><p>The young girl glanced at Lu Ming and laughed heartily. She was extremely pleased with herself.</p><p>Then, the girl formed a seal and began to collect the beast souls.</p><p>Soon, the girl put away the beast soul of the giant snake.</p><p>At this moment, a bird-type beast soul with flames all over its body appeared.</p><p>It screeched continuously and danced in the air.</p><p>However, the altar seemed to have a force that restrained them, making it difficult for them to escape.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>This was because he felt that the demon subduing spear in the Supreme shrine was buzzing and vibrating, as if it was particularly excited.</p><p>“Don’t tell me …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. With a thought, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>The moment the demon subduing spear appeared, it trembled violently and flew out with a whoosh. The spear emitted a bright light that enveloped the two beast souls.</p><p>OWW! Gah!</p><p>With two roars, the two beast souls turned into two beams of light and were absorbed by the demon subduing spear. Then, the demon subduing spear flew back to Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Not far away, the beautiful girl was dumbfounded.</p><p>She opened her cherry-like mouth and stared at the altar with her big, watery eyes. Then, she stared at Lu Ming. To be more precise, she stared at the demon subduing spear in Lu Ming’s hand. After a long while, she let out an earth-shattering scream.</p><p>“Demon subduing spear, how did you get a demon subduing spear?”</p><p>The young girl shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the altar trembled violently. It was ten times, dozens of times stronger than before.</p><p>Thump thump …</p><p>A rumbling sound came from the altar, as if some great demon was about to step out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent vibration, a giant Silver Wolf rushed out of the altar.</p><p>The giant wolf was covered in silver-white fur that flickered with a crystal-like luster. It stood in the air, and its height was five meters and its length was more than ten meters.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>&Nbsp; the giant Silver Wolf appeared and howled at the sky, releasing an unbelievably powerful pressure.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. It was as if he had been hit by a huge mountain. He retreated a few steps and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The young girl was not much better off. She was also retreating, her face pale.</p><p>terrifying, it’s too terrifying. What level is this beast soul of? it’s only a beast soul, but it can emit such a terrifying pressure. How powerful must it have been when it was alive? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Silver Wolf beast soul in the air, shocked beyond words.</p><p>“Beast King, this is the soul of the beast King, haha!”</p><p>The girl laughed and quickly formed a seal with her hands. A black light enveloped the Silver Wolf.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the demon subduing spear trembled violently and also emitted a ray of light that shot toward the giant Silver Wolf.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant Silver Wolf howled at the sky.</p><p>However, he was only a beast soul, not a physical body. His aura was powerful, but he did not have much combat power.</p><p>“Kid, what are you doing? Why aren’t you putting away your demon subduing spear?”</p><p>The young girl shrieked.</p><p>“Put it away? Why should I keep it? Didn’t you say I can’t accept it?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … Detestable!”</p><p>The young girl was helpless. She could only frantically form hand seals and snatch the beast soul from the demon subduing spear.</p><p>The two rays of light covered the giant Silver Wolf Soul and started to tear it apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, the soul of the giant Silver Wolf actually split into two. Half was taken away by the girl, and the other half was taken away by the demon subduing spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The demon-subduing spear flew back into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“You … You actually stole half of my beast King Soul. Return it to me!”</p><p>The young girl glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>“I won’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming refused decisively and kept the demon subduing spear.</p><p>beast King Soul, this is a beast King Soul. With your current cultivation and physical strength, you can’t use it at all. You should return it to me!</p><p>The young girl glared at Lu Ming resentfully. Her large eyes were misty as if she was about to cry. She looked very pitiful.</p><p>“I won’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved and firmly refused.</p><p>What a joke. This was the soul of a beast King, and it had been preserved by the Dongyi tribe with a secret technique. Even the outside world couldn’t buy it. It was so precious that it was impossible to return it.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
