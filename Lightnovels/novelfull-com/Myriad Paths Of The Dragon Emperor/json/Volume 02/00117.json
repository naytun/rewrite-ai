His strength was even stronger than PU sichong’s.</p><p>However, the difference between him and Duanmu Yunyang was too great.</p><p>One blade. With just one blade, du he had been defeated. He had been completely defeated. He did not even have the power to fight back.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s blade was extremely terrifying. It seemed as if it could split the heavens and earth.</p><p>No one knew how much of Duanmu Yunyang’s strength he had used in this attack. However, there was no doubt that it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>It was even more intense than before. Those who could enter the top 30 were all extremely strong.</p><p>Some two people with similar strength clashed, and the battle was extremely fierce. There was even a battle that took nearly a thousand moves before the victor was decided.</p><p>But there were also some battles that were completely one-sided.</p><p>For example, Zhang Muyun had casually dealt with his opponent with a single palm.</p><p>Bu xingkai, who was ranked third on the bronze list, and Duan gang, who was ranked fourth, had also defeated their opponents with one move.</p><p>What caught Lu Ming’s attention was bu xingkai, as he was also a spear user. Moreover, he was a genius from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Although the mystical sword sect was known as the sword sect, and there were many who used swords, there were also many who used other weapons.</p><p>That was why there were so many first places.</p><p>For example, Zhang Muyun was known as the number one sword among the bronze disciples.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was known as the first blade.</p><p>Bu xingkai was called the first spear.</p><p>No. 51, Lu Ming, versus No. 12, Gu Qing.</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>“Gu Qing, Lu Ming’s opponent this time is Gu Qing?”</p><p>it seems that this is the end for Lu Ming. However, as a new disciple, it’s already amazing that he can reach this stage.</p><p>if Lu Ming is defeated, he will definitely be defeated. But how many moves Can Lu Ming take from Gu Qing? ”</p><p>“A few moves? In my opinion, ten moves shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p>it’s hard to say. I’m guessing it’ll be within ten moves.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the discussions around him. He stood up and walked towards the fighting ring.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, I believe in you. You will definitely win.”</p><p>Pang Shi shouted. He had blind trust in Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned to pang Shi and smiled. “Big rock, with your words, I’m sure I’ll win.”</p><p>After saying that, he laughed and walked forward.</p><p>“Where does this guy’s confidence come from?” Mu Lan pouted.</p><p>“This guy has always been overconfident.”</p><p>Feng Wu said.</p><p>Although they said that, there was a flash of anticipation in the depths of their eyes. They were also looking forward to Lu Ming breaking their understanding again.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring, Gu Qing also stepped onto the fighting ring. The two of them stood opposite each other.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but size Gu Qing up. Gu Qing was dressed in a long purple robe and carried a long sword on his back. He had an ordinary appearance, but there was a burning aura emanating from his body.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, although you’re ranked at the bottom, I won’t show any mercy to any opponent. You have to be careful,”</p><p>Gu Qing cupped his fists and was very polite.</p><p>“Senior brother Gu, feel free to use all your strength. If I can’t withstand it and get injured, it’s my fault for not being good enough.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, since that’s the case, take this. Starfire Prairie Fire.</p><p>Gu Qing unsheathed the longsword on his back. With a flick of his wrist, the longsword burst out with hundreds of sword Qi. Each sword Qi was fiery red and filled with a scorching intent, sealing off the space where Lu Ming was.</p><p>it’s here! It’s Gu Qing’s famous martial art, Starfire Prairie Sword Art!</p><p>“Black grade low level martial arts technique, Starfire Prairie Fire, sword Qi is like a Prairie Fire, covering an extremely large area, and it’s almost impossible to avoid it with movement techniques. Once you can’t avoid it, you’ll have to face wave after wave of continuous attacks, without end.”</p><p>I heard that Gu Qing specializes in one type of martial arts technique. He has already cultivated it to an astonishing fourth stage and has reached the point of perfection. Lu Ming, how many moves can you take? ”</p><p>The disciples who were watching the battle stared at the fighting ring without blinking.</p><p>the genius ranked 12th is indeed powerful. A black grade low level martial arts technique has actually been cultivated to the fourth stage. Gu Qing’s body is definitely not weak either, at least reaching complete grade one. Otherwise, he would not be able to strike so quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not stop and swept the long spear horizontally.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>The crescent-shaped spear radiance flashed and produced a powerful force that destroyed the surrounding sword Qi.</p><p>However, a single spark could set a Prairie on fire. Once the sword Qi was extinguished, even more sword Qi emerged and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>since I can’t destroy it, I’ll use a powerful force to break this sword technique!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He leaped up and pulled his long spear from the bottom to the top. Wherever the long spear passed, the sword Qi was destroyed, revealing an empty area.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming executed the mountain crash from above. At the same time, the essential Qi in his body gushed into the long spear wildly. The long spear trembled and was filled with an immense force.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the peak of the eighth grade master realm. In addition, his essential Qi was three times stronger and more condensed than other essential Qi. In addition, his physical body was at the second stage lower tier. Although Lu Ming did not unleash his full power, his strength was still extremely shocking.</p><p>Even if it was a small hill, Lu Ming would have destroyed it with this shot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear smashed down, and the sword Qi was swept away.</p><p>The violent Qi smashed onto Gu Qing’s sword, causing his body to shake violently, and he was forced to take more than ten steps back.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around.</p><p>Everyone looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually broken Gu Qing’s Starfire Prairie sword technique with one shot. The method was brutal and direct, but it was also the most effective.</p><p>“Lu Ming is too powerful. How does he have such great power?”</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming can win? Isn’t this too unbelievable?”</p><p>The disciples of the four halls found it hard to remain calm.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Qing’s face was extremely serious, and his eyes were filled with surprise, ” “Junior Brother Lu Ming, your talent is really beyond my expectations. However, it’s not that easy to defeat me. I can only use that move. I was planning to save it for the top ten, but it’s not a waste to use it on you.”</p><p>“Flame cage!”</p><p>Gu Qing shouted, and his body suddenly shot up into the sky. Layers of red flames suddenly appeared on his body, as if his whole body was suddenly burning.</p><p>Then, the flames swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body dodged continuously to avoid the flames. However, as soon as the flames landed on the ground, they started to burn. In an instant, Lu Ming’s surroundings turned into a sea of fire.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, this is my secret skill, flame cage. If you can break this move, I’ll admit defeat.”</p><p>Gu Qing’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Secret art, what a wondrous secret art.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>A secret skill was completely different from a martial skill. There was no difference in levels.</p><p>However, each secret skill was extremely wondrous and difficult to cultivate. It also required some special conditions to successfully cultivate.</p><p>Once it was used, it could greatly increase the strength of the martial artist. However, there were always losses. Secret skills also had various restrictions. For example, once some secret skills were used, the martial artist would fall into a weak state and be at the mercy of others.</p><p>Gu Qing’s Secret skill was to burn his genuine Qi as fuel, turning it into a flame cage.</p><p>“Unfortunately, how can flames stop me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a confident smile.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
