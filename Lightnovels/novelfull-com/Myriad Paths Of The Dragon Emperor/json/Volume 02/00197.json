Who will save my Ling ‘er!”</p><p>Not far away, a woman screamed in fear and ran towards the little girl.</p><p>However, she was obviously not a martial artist, so there was no time at all.</p><p>None of the other martial artists in the surroundings made a move.</p><p>The eyes of those martial artists were filled with fear.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast clearly saw the little girl. With a roar and a bloodthirsty glint in its eyes, it ran toward the little girl.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was already close to the little girl.</p><p>The armor-breaking beast opened its mouth and bit the little girl.</p><p>Its huge mouth was big enough to swallow a little girl.</p><p>Behind them, the people on the horses laughed.</p><p>“Armor-breaker, enjoy it!”</p><p>A young man in a gold-threaded robe shouted excitedly.</p><p>At this moment, the little girl had already forgotten to cry. She was just staring blankly at him. Clearly, she was shocked.</p><p>“Ling ‘er!”</p><p>The woman let out a shrill cry.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>They actually released beasts to eat people on the streets. Was this still the Imperial City?</p><p>Just as the armor-breaking beast was about to bite the little girl, Lu Ming moved. His figure swayed slightly and he appeared beside the little girl. He reached out to hold the little girl and drifted backward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Seeing that the fat meat in its mouth had been snatched away, the armor-breaking beast roared angrily and pounced at Lu Ming with a murderous look in its eyes.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly widened and he shouted loudly. A fiendish aura that was stronger than the armor-breaking beast’s burst out.</p><p>The armor-breaking beast roared with fear in its eyes. Like a frightened puppy, it ran away.</p><p>“Who’s there? You dare to stop this young master’s war beast from eating, you’re courting death!”</p><p>A furious roar rang out.</p><p>Ta ta ta.</p><p>Seven or eight war horses galloped over.</p><p>The person in the lead was the young man in the gold-threaded robe.</p><p>The young man’s face was slightly pale. His eyes were malicious as he stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The armor-splitting beast stood in front of the Golden-robed young man. It seemed to have grown bolder and growled at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little sister, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at the other party. Instead, he smiled at the little girl in his arms.</p><p>“I’m fine, Ling ‘er is fine. Thank you, big brother!”</p><p>The little girl said obediently.</p><p>At this moment, the woman had already run over. To Lu Ming’s surprise, the woman did not look at the little girl immediately. Instead, she knelt down in front of the Golden-robed young man and shouted,”Little Prince, I beg you to let Ling ‘er go. Ling’ er is only five years old!”</p><p>“Bitch, go to the side and die!”</p><p>Beside the Golden-robed young man, a thin-faced young man shouted coldly. He pulled out the soft whip in his hand and whipped the woman’s body. Immediately, a bloody mark appeared on the woman’s body, and blood oozed out, dyeing her clothes red.</p><p>“Mother!”</p><p>The little girl shouted.</p><p>However, the woman ignored him and struggled to get up. She continued to kowtow to the young man in the Golden robe and shouted, ” “Little Prince, I beg you, please do a good deed and let Ling ‘er go!”</p><p>Thump thump thump</p><p>The woman’s forehead hit the ground. Her forehead was broken and blood flowed out.</p><p>“What’s the use of kowtowing? That little girl is dead for sure.”</p><p>“That’s right, how can the food that the Huajie Warbeast has its eyes on be settled by kowtowing?”</p><p>it’s a pity for that young man. He probably just arrived at the imperial capital, but he actually interfered in this matter. I’m afraid his end will be miserable.</p><p>“He can only blame his bad luck!”</p><p>Whispers came from the surroundings.</p><p>His voice was very soft as he was afraid that Hua Jie would hear him. However, what was Lu Ming’s cultivation level? He still heard every single word.</p><p>But he just smiled.</p><p>The woman continued to kowtow. On the warhorse, the Golden-robed young man, Hua Jie, furrowed his brows. His narrow eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“I told you to get lost, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>The thin-faced young man’s face revealed a ferocious expression as he whipped the woman again.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He reached out and grabbed the soft whip.</p><p>brat, how dare you interfere when I didn’t look for you. Now, kneel down and slap yourself a hundred times. Put down this little girl obediently and get lost!</p><p>The thin-faced young man pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened and he looked at the thin-faced young man coldly.</p><p>“Kid, why aren’t you letting go? Alright, since that’s the case, you’ll also become food for my young master’s war beast!”</p><p>The thin-faced young man pulled on the soft whip, but found that it didn’t move at all, so he immediately shouted again.</p><p>“Do you usually feed your warbeasts with humans?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“So what if I am? These lowlifes are just like ants. To be able to become the food of my young master’s war beast, it’s their good fortune that they’ve cultivated for several lifetimes.”</p><p>The thin-faced young man shouted arrogantly. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>“What are you talking about? Hurry up and kill this kid, can’t you see that armor-breaker is hungry?”</p><p>At this moment, Hua Jie said indifferently. There was a hint of impatience in his voice.</p><p>The thin-faced young man’s expression changed drastically. He looked at Lu Ming ferociously and shouted, ” “Brat, then I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>With that, he leaped off his warhorse and pounced at Lu Ming like an eagle. His momentum was not weak.</p><p>“First grade great Martial Master realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>This thin-faced young man was not even thirty years old, but his cultivation was already at the first grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>However, in front of Lu Ming, it was not enough.</p><p>He flicked the soft whip in his hand, and a powerful true Qi burst out and rushed along the soft whip.</p><p>The thin-faced young man was still holding the soft whip in one hand. He suddenly felt a surge of power from the soft whip. This power rushed into his palm and almost caused it to explode. A terrifying wound appeared.</p><p>He also let go of the soft whip.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming swung the soft whip like a snake. It rolled out and wrapped around the thin-faced young man’s neck. Then, with a swing, the thin-faced young man fell to the ground heavily, stirring up a cloud of dust.</p><p>With just one move, the thin-faced first grade great Martial Master realm young man was lying on the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around.</p><p>so powerful! He settled it in one move!</p><p>“What’s so amazing about it? He dared to beat up Hua Jie’s men, he’s finished. It seems that this young man is indeed here for the first time!”</p><p>“You’re right, Hua Jie will never let him go.”</p><p>At this moment, the thin-faced young man let out an ear-piercing scream, ”</p><p>“Oh, really? Since that’s the case, I’ll feed you to the demonic beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He flicked the soft whip in his hand and the thin-faced young man’s body flew towards the armor-breaking beast.</p><p>At the same time, the blood on the thin-faced young man’s hand also splashed into the armor-breaking beast’s mouth.</p><p>Stimulated by the blood Qi, the armor-breaking beast let out a roar, and the bloodthirsty light in its eyes became even stronger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, it opened its bloody mouth and bit at the thin-faced young man.</p><p>“No, no, don’t!”</p><p>The thin-faced young man was so scared that his soul almost flew away as he frantically shouted.</p><p>“Ling ‘er, don’t look!”</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the little girl’s eyes.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast bit off one of the thin-faced young man’s arms.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
