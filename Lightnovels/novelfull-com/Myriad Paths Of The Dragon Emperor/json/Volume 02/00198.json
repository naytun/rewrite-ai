The stimulation of its blood made it go berserk. It ignored Hua Jie’s words and continued to pounce on the thin-faced young man.</p><p>ah, ah, help! Help!</p><p>The thin-faced young man screamed and wanted to escape, but he was wrapped by the soft whip and could not escape at all.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the soft whip and the thin-faced young man flew toward him.</p><p>The armor-breaking beast roared and continued to pounce.</p><p>Lu Ming put the little girl down and took a step forward, pressing his palm on the armor-breaking beast’s head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The armor-breaking beast’s huge body was pressed down on the ground by Lu Ming, causing cracks to appear on the ground.</p><p>The armor-breaking beast roared and struggled, but it was to no avail.</p><p>The thin-faced young man shouted. He looked at Lu Ming in shock. There was some doubt in his eyes. He did not know why Lu Ming wanted to save him.</p><p>“Don’t misunderstand, I don’t mean to save you. I just want you to feel what it’s like to be eaten by a demonic beast.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his voice void of any emotion.</p><p>“No, don’t, please let me go!”</p><p>The thin-faced young man screamed.</p><p>“Let you go? No, to be able to become the food of your family’s young master’s demonic beast, it’s a blessing that you’ve cultivated for several lifetimes. I must fulfill your wish.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>This sentence was what the thin-faced young man had said just now.</p><p>“No, no, I’m just talking nonsense. Just take it as a fart and let it go!”</p><p>The thin-faced young man said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>On his warhorse, Hua Jie’s face was extremely gloomy. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, this farce ends here. Three breaths, in three breaths, destroy your own cultivation and kowtow to me eighteen times. Then, I’ll let today’s matter rest.”</p><p>His words surprised the people around him. Hua Jie was willing to let Lu Ming go?</p><p>This was a rare occurrence. It seemed that Hua Jie was a little afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>Hua Jie sat on his warhorse and looked down at Lu Ming. In his opinion, he was already doing Lu Ming a great favor by offering such a condition.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to appreciate it.</p><p>“All of you, get out of my sight now, and I’ll let this go.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>This made the surrounding people dumbfounded.</p><p>Tell Hua Jie to get lost? It seemed that he really knew nothing about Hua Jie’s identity.</p><p>At the side, the woman held Ling ‘er tightly and shivered as if she was extremely afraid.</p><p>Hua Jie was stunned for a moment. Then, as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world, he laughed and said,”Tell me to get lost? Hahaha, good. Now, you have lost your only chance to live. Kill him!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Behind Hua Jie, six figures jumped off their war horses.</p><p>The six middle-aged men’s eyes were bright, and as they rose, their auras exploded.</p><p>They were all great martial masters.</p><p>The weakest of them was at the second grade great Martial Master realm, while the strongest had reached the third grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>Three second grade great martial masters and three third grade great martial masters joined forces, and their might was astonishing.</p><p>They wanted to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only glanced at them indifferently and then waved his palm.</p><p>On his palm, there was a flash of spirit. Lu Ming had already incorporated the force of the wind into it, making his palm move at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“Pa pa pa!”</p><p>The crowd only heard six slaps and then saw the six burly men flying back at a speed faster than their pounce. They fell heavily on the ground like six broken gunny sacks.</p><p>Everyone saw that the left side of each of the six burly men’s face was swollen, and a palm print could be clearly seen.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>The sound of cold gasps rang out.</p><p>Many people’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets as they looked on in shock.</p><p>A single slap had sent six great experts flying. They were all second or third grade great martial masters!</p><p>Lu Ming looked to be in his twenties but he was so terrifying. Where did this young expert come from?</p><p>It was too shocking.</p><p>The thin-faced young man was stunned, and his eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>Even the armor-breaking beast was shocked. The bloodlust in its eyes receded and was replaced by fear as it kept retreating.</p><p>Hua Jie was also stunned. After a while, he finally reacted and shouted angrily,”Little bastard, you still dare to fight back? you’re dead! I’m going to chop you up and feed you to the demonic beasts!”</p><p>“They all want my life, and I can’t even fight back?” Lu Ming sneered. His eyes were cold as he walked toward Hua Jie.</p><p>It was ridiculous. He really did not know what Hua Jie was thinking. Did he think that he was born nobler than others, that he could insult others and take their lives at will, and others could not fight back and just wait for him to take them away?</p><p>It was laughable!</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Hua Jie’s face was extremely gloomy. The murderous intent in his eyes was so strong that it could not be dispersed. He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>“What do you want? Don’t you like to feed other people’s lives to those animals of yours? I really want to know, when you become that beast’s food, what kind of expression will you have?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Hua Jie step by step and smiled faintly.</p><p>“You dare? Do you know who I am? If you dare to do this, I’ll exterminate your entire family!”</p><p>Hua Jie shouted.</p><p>“Who are you? It’s none of my business!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“So you don’t know who I am? Let me tell you, I’m the son of the Heavenly King. Don’t you know that my father is the Heavenly King? if you kneel down and admit your mistake now, you can still live!”</p><p>Hua Jie continued to shout, his eyes flashing with ruthlessness.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming did not know his identity. Now that he had revealed his identity, he believed that Lu Ming would be scared to death.</p><p>However, he was disappointed. Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. He did not even bat an eye.</p><p>It seemed that the Heavenly king’s name had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>Hua Jie’s expression changed. It was extremely ugly and he was flustered.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Hua Jie said, ” alright, just you wait. I will not let you off. Let’s go!</p><p>“Leave? did I say you could leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. He moved and appeared in front of Hua Jie.</p><p>“Kid, don’t be so ungrateful! I swear, if you dare to touch me today, I will make sure you die without a burial place.” Hua Jie roared.</p><p>“Is that so?” Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”Then I’ll have to try even more!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed red and he grabbed at Hua Jie.</p><p>“Stop, young man. Let me give you a piece of advice. My young master is not someone you can provoke!”</p><p>The six burly men rushed over again and one of them roared.</p><p>“You don’t know your place!”</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>Lu Ming used his finger as a spear and stabbed out.</p><p>Six spear lights burst out.</p><p>Bang Bang!</p><p>The six burly men roared and tried their best to block, but it was useless. They were once again sent flying and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Hua Jie’s expression changed.</p><p>“Now, no one can stop me.”</p><p>Lu Ming clawed at Hua Jie.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Hua Jie bellowed and wanted to resist. However, all his attacks were destroyed in an instant. Lu Ming grabbed his throat.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
