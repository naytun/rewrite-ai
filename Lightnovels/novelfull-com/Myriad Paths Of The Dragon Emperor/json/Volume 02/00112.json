He’s just a piece of trash. I told him to kneel down and admit defeat, but he still wanted to fight. With this little combat strength, he’s simply asking to be humiliated.”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong looked at the Vermillion Bird Hall’s side and sneered.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“Damn it, I’m so angry.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, including pang Shi, Hua Chi, and Feng Wu, were all flushed with anger.</p><p>At the very top of the stands, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect was expressionless, as if none of this could stir his emotions.</p><p>In The White Tiger Hall’s area, The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>The head of the Vermillion Bird Hall frowned.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Duanmu yunchong curled his lips in disdain. He walked toward Liu Hui and stepped on his body. He looked down at him and sneered,”Now, are we still going to fight?”</p><p>“Admit defeat, Liu Hui. Admit defeat. Stop fighting.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciple couldn’t help but call out.</p><p>“I … I admit defeat!”</p><p>Liu Hui said unwillingly. His eyes revealed a humiliated expression as he looked at Duanmu yunchong.</p><p>“Haha, you’ve admitted defeat. What were you doing earlier? what do you mean by that look? If you’re not willing, you’re still pissing me off. Pissing me off, you’re really a piece of trash.”</p><p>After he had finished speaking, Duanmu yunchong kicked out and sent Liu Hui flying.</p><p>“Duanmu yunchong, what are you doing? Liu Hui has already admitted defeat, yet you still attack. You have broken the rules.”</p><p>A Vermillion Bird Hall disciple shouted.</p><p>who said I attacked? I didn’t use any strength at all. I only asked him to move away. He was blocking my foot. I lifted my foot and he flew out.</p><p>Duanmu yunchong indifferently said.</p><p>“Nonsense, you did it on purpose.”</p><p>One of the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples roared.</p><p>On the fighting stage, the silver-robed elder slightly frowned. Duanmu yunchong had indeed broken the rules.</p><p>“Alright, yunchong, be careful when you lift your feet next time.”</p><p>At this moment, an old and vigorous voice came from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Yes, principal!”</p><p>Duanmu yunchong immediately said respectfully.</p><p>The voice came from The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster.</p><p>On the fighting stage, the silver-robed elder frowned. However, since The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster had spoken, he had no choice but to give him some face. After a moment of silence, he announced,”Duanmu yunchong wins this battle!”</p><p>“Damn it, the Duanmu family is really shameless.”</p><p>Feng Wu said through gritted teeth.</p><p>The other Vermilion Bird disciples were the same.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He suddenly said, ” “Don’t worry. This Duanmu yunchong won’t be arrogant for long.”</p><p>Feng Wu, Hua Chi, pang Shi, and the others were taken aback, not understanding what Lu Ming meant.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciples went up to help Liu Hui down and the competition continued.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense and exciting.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list all had combat strength that far exceeded their peers of the same level, and they had all kinds of profound level martial arts techniques and secret skills, which made people feel very satisfied.</p><p>Especially the geniuses in the top ten, they were unimaginably powerful. No matter what kind of opponent they faced, they would be dealt with in one move.</p><p>A few hours later, more than 20 matches had already passed. There were only five or six more matches left before it would end.</p><p>“Next round, No. 51 versus No. 46.”</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>“Fifty-one against forty-six? Why are they so close in ranking?”</p><p>“Which two?”</p><p>“Number 51 used to be Yao Tianyu, so it’s Lu Ming now. Number 46 is Yun Feng from the Onyx tortoise Hall.”</p><p>“Lu Ming? Based on the abilities that Lu Ming displayed when he killed Yao Tianyu, he might be able to defeat Yun Feng. He’s so lucky.”</p><p>“Indeed, we’re too lucky.”</p><p>The silver-robed elder’s words caused a wave of discussion.</p><p>Back then, Yao Tianyu had not only cultivated a black grade low level martial arts technique to the second level, but his physical body had also been cultivated to complete grade one. His combat strength had already surpassed his ranking, and some people believed that Yao Tianyu could already be ranked in the fifth level.</p><p>Since Lu Ming was able to kill Yao Tianyu, his combat strength was definitely stronger than Yao Tianyu’s. Some people had speculated that with Lu Ming’s combat strength, he might be ranked around the fortieth place. They all thought that Lu Ming was too lucky to be up against Yun Feng.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, that little bastard. Why is he so lucky!</p><p>In The White Tiger hall area, Lu yunxiong gritted his teeth.</p><p>“So what if I’m lucky? Even if you’re lucky enough to make it into the top 30, you’ll still be challenged by others. That’ll be even more embarrassing.”</p><p>A young man from the Duanmu family sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the discussions around him. He got up and went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Good luck, senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pang Shi shouted.</p><p>However, other than pang Shi, no one else was cheering for Lu Ming.</p><p>The other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples had similar thoughts as the others. They all thought that even if Lu Ming made it into the top 30, he would be challenged by others. If they cheered for Lu Ming now, wouldn’t it be even more embarrassing?</p><p>A burly young man from the Black Tortoise walked up to the fighting ring. He was Yun Feng, who was ranked 46th.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you’re very strong, I’ll give it my all in this battle. I hope you won’t hold back.”</p><p>Yun Feng looked at Lu Ming and said loudly.</p><p>“I know what I’m doing, you can use your full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Yun Feng’s eyes narrowed. Lu Ming’s confidence made him not dare to be careless. He focused all his attention and exploded with all his strength.</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of Yun Feng’s body. Then, a red light flashed on his body. A black rhinoceros roared, and four chakras appeared. His bloodline burst out.</p><p>“Mad rhinoceros slash!”</p><p>Yun Feng sprinted and slashed out with the saber in his hand. A terrifying saber radiance seemed to be able to cut open the space.</p><p>At this moment, Yun Feng’s essence, energy, and spirit were highly concentrated. At this moment, he erupted with extraordinary strength.</p><p>“That’s the third stage of a black grade low level martial arts technique, and Yun Feng actually broke through. Good!”</p><p>A silver-robed elder in the Onyx tortoise Hall’s area cheered.</p><p>The other people present were also shocked. They didn’t expect that Yun Feng would surpass them when faced with pressure, causing his black rank martial skill to break through from the second level to the third level.</p><p>“Lu Ming is in danger now.”</p><p>Such a thought appeared in many people’s minds.</p><p>“It’s even better that you’ve broken through!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. Then, he suddenly took a step forward and dashed toward Yun peak.</p><p>The long spear in his hand was pulled forward, bringing out a crescent moon.</p><p>“Fire gun art-moon pulling!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear struck Yun Feng’s saber, causing a loud boom. The entire fighting ring seemed to shake.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a figure flew out like a cannonball and glided more than 30 meters on the huge fighting ring that was more than 200 meters in length and width.</p><p>Then, his body trembled and he knelt down, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded. The figure that had been sent flying was Yun Feng.</p><p>One move. With just one move, Yun Feng was sent flying by Lu Ming, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Even a blind person could tell that the difference between Yun Feng and Lu Ming was too great.</p><p>How did this happen? How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>He was simply too strong, terrifyingly strong. Was he still a newcomer this year?</p><p>Yun Feng had clearly broken through right before the battle, but he was still sent flying with a single strike.</p><p>Although some people had guessed that Lu Ming would win, they did not expect him to win so easily.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
