The sound of thunder rumbled as nine lightning swords headed toward Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>“World annihilation!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang roared. A deathly white sword-light soared into the sky as he used all his strength to resist.</p><p>After the light had dissipated, Duanmu Yunyang quickly retreated. A deep, bloody gash had appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang, I’ve said it before. You’re not my match!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s clothes were as white as snow as he stepped forward.</p><p>With every step he took, the aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>with their cultivation, as long as they want to, they can break through to the martial Grandmaster realm in the blink of an eye. There will be no bottlenecks in the martial Grandmaster realm, and they can break through all the way. After all, they have accumulated too much.</p><p>A powerful silver rank disciple exclaimed.</p><p>“Hahaha, Zhang Muyun, you think you’ve won? Take my last move! Blood exterminating slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang laughed out loud. Blood gushed out from his wound and formed a Blood Blade in the air.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang waved his hand. The blood Blade turned into a blood-red light and slashed toward Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s eyes flickered, and a sword light whizzed out, hitting the blood Blade.</p><p>However, the blood saber suddenly dissipated and turned into a blood mist. Then, the blood mist condensed and turned into blood leopards that rushed toward Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s long sword swept out, and streams of sword Qi flew out, scattering the blood leopards. However, after the blood leopards scattered, they turned into blood mist and then condensed back into blood leopards again. It seemed endless.</p><p>“What a strange secret technique. Is this Duanmu Yunyang’s trump card?”</p><p>“I have never heard of Duanmu Yunyang knowing this secret technique. It seems that he has had a fortuitous encounter during this period of time.”</p><p>“Could it be that Zhang Muyun is going to lose?”</p><p>“Hahaha! Zhang Muyun, this blood obliteration slash is meant to deal with you. Today, you’ll definitely lose.” Duanmu Yunyang laughed wildly.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang, I thought you had some capabilities. Once your cultivation level is higher, this secret skill will no longer be of any use. Let me tell you what the great Dao is. Break!”</p><p>As Zhang Muyun finished speaking, an extremely powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>An incomparably sharp, all-conquering, and all-conquering aura suddenly exploded out.</p><p>That’s right, it’s ‘Chi’.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Bzzzz …</p><p>At this moment, the big shots of the four halls, such as the four deans, the silver-robed elders, and the gold-robed elders, all stood up from their seats.</p><p>In addition to the sect leader, there were also Two Bright Lights in the sect leader’s eyes.</p><p>“Force, it’s the metal force. Zhang Muyun has actually comprehended the control force.”</p><p>“He’s a genius, a genius. He actually comprehended control force at the master realm. Incredible.”</p><p>“Haha, our mystical sword sect has another true genius.”</p><p>The silver-robed elders cried out in excitement.</p><p>Hearing the silver-robed elder’s words, the confused disciples were shocked.</p><p>The bronze disciples, including most of the silver disciples, had not yet comprehended the control force, but they had heard of it and knew its power. How could they not be shocked?</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The ‘force’ of metal was indestructible and extremely sharp.</p><p>As soon as the metal force was used, everything was broken. In an instant, the blood leopards surrounding Zhang Muyun were shattered and could no longer form again.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang let out a blood-curdling screech and retreated a dozen steps. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Hahaha, Zhang Muyun, I didn’t expect you to have comprehended control force. I lost, I didn’t lose in vain.”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang laughed miserably. A dispirited look appeared on his face. The overbearing aura that he had exuded earlier had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was right. Secret techniques were just a small path. Controlling force was the true path. The earlier one comprehended controlling force, the more useful it would be in the future.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was able to comprehend the control force at the master realm, which meant that his talent was far above his. Perhaps he would never be able to catch up to Zhang Muyun in his life.</p><p>At this moment, he had lost all fighting spirit.</p><p>“Yunyang, what are you doing? Martial artists walk against the heavens. Only with the will to fight and become more courageous can one step into the peak of martial arts. You, wake up!”</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster suddenly shouted.</p><p>The shout was like thunder, exploding in Duanmu Yunyang’s ears. Duanmu Yunyang was startled and suddenly woke up. He was instantly scared and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>He was in a very dangerous situation just now. If he didn’t wake up in time, his state of mind might be shattered, and he might lose his way on the path of martial arts, never to improve again.</p><p>This was the so-called inner demon.</p><p>“Thank you, principal!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang bowed to The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster. Then, he looked at Zhang Muyun. His eyes were filled with a domineering aura as he said,”Zhang Muyun, I will catch up to you sooner or later. I will take back the glory that belongs to me.”</p><p>Then, he turned around and left the fighting ring.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun wins this round. Let’s move on to the next round.”</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>However, after the peak battle just now, the next few matches could no longer arouse the interest of the crowd.</p><p>In most people’s eyes, the results of this competition were already out. The first place would definitely go to Zhang Muyun, and the second place would go to Duanmu Yunyang. Although there were still two more rounds, there was no suspense.</p><p>Not long after, the seventh round ended. After a short rest, the eighth round began.</p><p>There were not many changes in the first four matches, as the outcome was within everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“The fifth match, Lu Ming versus Duanmu Yunyang.”</p><p>The judge announced the names of the players in the fifth match.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were slightly lifted.</p><p>Finally, it was time for the battle between Lu Ming and Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had repeatedly slapped the Duanmu family’s people in the face. Duanmu Yunyang had said that he would make Lu Ming lose ‘unsightly’.</p><p>Lu Ming also responded strongly. The two of them had yet to fight but sparks were already flying.</p><p>Now that they had finally met, what would the result be?</p><p>How many moves could Lu Ming block? Would he be badly abused?</p><p>The two of them walked onto the fighting ring and stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s finally our turn. I still keep my word. If you don’t admit defeat quickly, you’ll be ‘defeated very badly’.”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s voice was ice-cold and still extremely overbearing.</p><p>“How could he be defeated so easily? Are you talking about yourself? Previously, you were indeed defeated very unsightly and gracelessly. Your heart of martial Dao almost collapsed.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He was referring to the battle between Duanmu Yunyang and Zhang Muyun.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you shouldn’t have brought this up. Since you’ve brought it up, it’s not something that can be resolved by a terrible defeat.”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s expression turned completely cold. It was as cold as the Arctic Ocean. Killing intent flickered in his eyes. He did not bother to hide it.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang has the intention to kill. Lu Ming is in trouble.”</p><p>“Lu Ming is acting on impulse. He shouldn’t have provoked Duanmu Yunyang.”</p><p>that’s right. Other than not being allowed to harm lives, there are no other restrictions on the fighting ring. If Lu Ming refuses to admit defeat, even the sect master will not be able to interfere. Lu Ming’s consequences are worrying.</p><p>Some disciples shook their heads. They felt that Lu Ming’s actions were unwise. This would only anger Duanmu Yunyang even more. Why bother?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
