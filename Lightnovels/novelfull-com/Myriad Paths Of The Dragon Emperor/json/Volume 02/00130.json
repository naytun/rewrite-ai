I can name the reward as I wish!</p><p>Lu Ming sized Mu Lan up and smiled.</p><p>The smile on Mu Lan’s face instantly disappeared. She became flustered and blushed as she cried out,”Lu Ming, you … You … What are you looking at? You’re so young, yet you’re always thinking of such shameless things.”</p><p>“Shameless business? Senior Sister Mu Lan, are you mistaken? I’m just thinking about what kind of reward I should get. What are you thinking!”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended not to know anything and said in surprise, especially the last sentence, which was dragged out.</p><p>“Lu Ming … You …”</p><p>Mu Lan was a little overwhelmed.</p><p>“Giggle!”</p><p>Feng Wu chuckled. She had suffered this move from Lu Ming before.</p><p>“Then tell me now, what reward do you want?”</p><p>Mu Lan forced herself to remain calm as she asked.</p><p>well, I haven’t thought about it yet. I’ll tell you when I think about it.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Cunning!”</p><p>At the side, Feng Wu and the rest gave Lu Ming a contemptuous look.</p><p>At this moment, the judge began to announce the rankings.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming was ranked first with a record of total victory.</p><p>Zhang Muyun had eight wins and one loss, so he was ranked second.</p><p>As for Duanmu Yunyang, although he was absent from the battle, his battle prowess was obvious to all. After a discussion among the elders, he was ranked third.</p><p>Bu xingkai was fourth, Duan gang was fifth, Ling Kong was sixth, Duanmu Chen was seventh, Cheng Feicheng was eighth, and Zhuo yirong ninth.</p><p>Dong CE was the most miserable. With a record of complete defeat, he was ranked tenth.</p><p>Among the top ten, The White Tiger Hall had four people. Moreover, they were all ranked very high, so their total points were first.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall had two people. However, since Lu Ming was ranked first, his total points jumped to second place.</p><p>The three from Azure Dragon Hall were ranked third.</p><p>The Onyx tortoise Hall only had Duan gang, and he was ranked fourth.</p><p>When the ranking of the four halls came out, the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples, the Vermillion Bird Hall Dean, and the elders were all ecstatic.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall was supposed to be at the bottom, but now, they had suddenly shot up to second place. In the coming year, the sect’s resources would definitely be inclined towards the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Moreover, the New Year’s recruitment was about to begin in three months. By then, Lu Ming’s reputation would definitely attract many young talents to join the Vermillion Bird Hall. This would be a virtuous cycle. In a few years ‘time, the Vermillion Bird Hall would become truly powerful and would no longer be at the bottom.</p><p>After announcing the rankings, it was time to announce the rewards.</p><p>Lu Ming was ranked first and the reward was very generous.</p><p>You can go to the book collection Hall and choose two black grade low level martial arts techniques, in addition to the reward of 100000 contribution points.</p><p>The rewards were extremely generous.</p><p>The second and third place could choose the reward of a black grade low level martial arts technique, as well as the reward of 80000 and 50000 contribution points, respectively.</p><p>The fourth to tenth place would not be rewarded with any martial arts techniques, only contribution points.</p><p>“Now, follow me to receive your reward!”</p><p>The judge said.</p><p>Today’s competition ended here. Tomorrow, the silver disciple competition would continue.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards slowly dispersed. Lu Ming followed the judge and went to the library.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was also with him.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was currently unconscious, so he could only collect it in the future.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s identity Jade card had an additional one hundred thousand contribution points.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at the entrance of the library.</p><p>“Lu Ming, according to the rules, you can choose two black grade low level martial arts techniques, but you can also combine two martial arts techniques into one. You can choose one black grade high level martial arts technique.”</p><p>The judge said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I can choose a black grade high level martial arts technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’d advise you to choose two black level low grade martial arts techniques,”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s expression, the judge warned him.</p><p>“Oh? Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Because the martial arts technique’s reward is only for you to learn and cultivate on your own, and can not be privately passed on to others, nor can it be sold. Although a black grade high level martial arts technique is more precious than two black grade low level martial arts techniques, with your current cultivation, it is too difficult to cultivate a black grade high level martial arts technique. And choosing a black grade low level martial arts technique, with your talent, you can cultivate it, this is the most cost-effective.”</p><p>The judge explained seriously.</p><p>“Thank you for your warning, elder, but I’m free to decide,” Lu Ming said after some thought.</p><p>Lu Ming still intended to choose a black level high level martial arts technique. After all, there was a wonderful chanting sound in the Supreme shrine that could help him understand martial arts techniques.</p><p>Others might not be able to cultivate it, but it did not mean that he could not.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had already made up his mind, the judge did not try to persuade him anymore. He greeted the elder who was guarding the door and Lu Ming walked into the library with Zhang Muyun.</p><p>The book collection Hall was divided into seven floors.</p><p>The first level stored some unrated cultivation methods and martial techniques.</p><p>The second floor stored yellow grade lower level martial arts techniques.</p><p>The third floor stored yellow rank upper class martial arts techniques.</p><p>…..</p><p>And so on, the seventh floor would be the upper earth level martial arts techniques.</p><p>Earth grade top level was the highest level martial skill in the mystical sword sect. It was extremely rare and precious.</p><p>Zhang Muyun came to the fourth level while Lu Ming walked towards the fifth level.</p><p>The fifth floor was filled with black grade high level cultivation methods and martial techniques.</p><p>The fifth level was not big. There were only nine shelves. Lu Ming took a glance and saw that there were only about fifty cultivation methods and martial arts techniques.</p><p>The huge mystical sword sect had been established for thousands of years, but there were only fifty or so black grade high level cultivation methods and martial arts techniques. It could be seen how precious and rare black grade high level cultivation methods and martial arts techniques were.</p><p>Lu Ming read the books one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming directly ignored the cultivation techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming had the true war Dragon technique and did not care about the other cultivation techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming also ignored the sword and knife techniques.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming finally saw the one step spear technique.</p><p>“Meteor spear technique.” The spear strikes were like meteors, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>For spear techniques, he had the fire gun art. He had not yet cultivated the fire gun art to the highest level, but it was enough for him in a short time.</p><p>Even if he chose a black grade high level spear technique, it would not increase his battle strength much in a short period of time.</p><p>He continued reading.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Soaring steps. Lu Ming saw a movement martial arts technique.</p><p>Sky steps, when cultivated to a profound level, could allow one to walk in the air and cross the void.</p><p>Lu Ming was very tempted to cross the void.</p><p>Who wouldn’t want to be like a bird, able to soar through the nine Heavens and look down at the mountains and rivers?</p><p>However, only when a warrior reached the martial arts Grandmaster realm could he truly break free from the shackles of the earth and soar above the nine Heavens.</p><p>However, it was actually possible to do it with the step in the air. Although it was noted at the back that it was only a short walk in the air and could not really cross the air like a martial arts Grandmaster powerhouse, it was still very attractive.</p><p>Lu Ming chose the ” air walk ” without any hesitation.</p><p>He came to the entrance of the library Hall and handed the secret manual to the elder of the library Hall.</p><p>“You must return it within two months.”</p><p>The elder of the book collection Hall registered and warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took the manual and bade the judge farewell before heading to the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
