She looked at Lu Ming smugly and snorted coldly.</p><p>Immediately, the young girl rolled her eyes and suddenly said, ” “Brat, your combat strength is not bad. Why don’t we join forces and break into the core of this cave? How is it?”</p><p>“The core area? Isn’t this the core?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>of course not. This is the cave abode left behind by a martial King realm master, an ancestor of the Dongyi tribe. How can it be given away with just a few manuals? ”</p><p>The young girl laughed in disdain.</p><p>he’s a peerless expert of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in his heart. At the same time, there was a burning desire in his eyes.</p><p>A martial King realm martial artist, also known as a King, was incredibly powerful. There might not even be a martial King realm expert in the burning sun Empire.</p><p>Kings had the power to destroy the heavens and earth, overturn rivers and seas, and were unimaginably powerful.</p><p>This was the cave mansion of a martial King realm expert. What kind of treasures would there be?</p><p>“How is it? Let’s join forces?”</p><p>The young lady said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He was a little puzzled. This young girl should be itching to bite him, right? Why would he be so kind to invite him to help?</p><p>who cares? let’s agree first. This is a King’s ruin!</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and said,”alright, I agree to work with you!” &Nbsp;</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>The young lady smiled, her beauty capable of causing the downfall of cities and countries.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but be stunned. this young lady is really pretty. She’s not inferior to Mu Lan and Qiu Yue at all. In fact, she’s even better than them. Unfortunately, she’s too evil.</p><p>The girl touched one of the walls of the stone room. Not long after, the stone room’s wall made a cracking sound, and a stone door appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised. He could not help but ask, ” “Who are you? Why are you so familiar with this place?”</p><p>of course I’ve investigated it thoroughly. Why else would I come to this place so easily? as for who I am, why should I tell you? ”</p><p>The young girl rolled her eyes at Lu Ming and snorted coldly. She was the first to enter the stone door.</p><p>Lu Ming followed him in.</p><p>Behind the stone door was a passage that twisted here and there. After exiting the passage, there was another stone room. However, there was nothing left in this stone room.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the young girl and passed three stone rooms.</p><p>Finally, they ran into trouble.</p><p>In the fourth stone chamber, they encountered the demonic corpse and the demonic puppet.</p><p>There were a total of six demonic corpses and demonic puppets. Each of them had the combat strength of a fifth grade great Martial Master.</p><p>The six of them joined forces, and the two of them were caught in a difficult battle.</p><p>However, the eyes of the demonic corpses and demonic puppets were their weak points. The two of them took more than ten minutes to kill all six demonic corpses and puppets.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to a stone door at the side of the stone room.</p><p>This stone door was taller and wider than the previous one.</p><p>It was more than two meters wide. When the stone door was opened, a dark passage was revealed.</p><p>if I remember correctly, we will reach the final core area after passing through this passage, but there must be inscriptions on this passage.</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the two of them walked in.</p><p>The deeper they went, the wider the cave became. In the end, it became a huge passage that was seven to eight meters high and more than ten meters wide.</p><p>Surprisingly, there was no movement for the first 1000 meters.</p><p>But after walking for about a thousand meters, inscriptions began to flash around the cave and on the ground.</p><p>Countless inscriptions glowed, and then, a scorching aura spread out. In the next moment, the entire passage turned red, as if it was in a fire domain.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>A large patch of fiery red flames appeared and filled the tunnel.</p><p>This was a real flame, not an illusion, but formed by inscriptions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a tall figure walked out of the flames. His entire body was condensed from flames, and he held a huge flame sword in his hand, slashing it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“A flame spirit condensed from runes!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He did not dare to underestimate her. The fire Tung spear appeared and he thrust it forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The powerful Spear’s gleam pierced through the flame spirit. However, after the flame spirit was dispersed, it instantly condensed again and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a few other flame spirits condensed and charged at Lu Ming with flaming sabers, flaming spears, and other weapons in hand.</p><p>On the other side, the beautiful young lady was in the same situation. She was surrounded and killed by the fire spirits.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Booms rang out continuously as the two of them engaged in a great battle with the flame spirits.</p><p>However, these fire spirits were very powerful and couldn’t be destroyed. After being scattered, they would gather again, making them very difficult to deal with.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and keep charging forward. As long as we can get past this place, we’ll reach the final core area.”</p><p>The young girl called out.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and leaned against the young girl. The two of them attacked together and rushed forward.</p><p>However, there were more and more flame spirits in front of them, and the temperature of the flames was getting higher and higher. The two of them seemed to be in a furnace.</p><p>“The flames are my battlefield!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The power of the fire erupted and formed a wonderful domain around him. When he walked past, the flames automatically retreated.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Fire ruthless waved his spear, and the flames were driven by the spear, forming a fire Dragon that blasted toward the flame spirits.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One by one, the fire spirits were blown away.</p><p>“The fire here is really magical. It’s completely different from the fire of a volcano. The fire of a volcano is about erupting and destroying everything. However, the fire here has a spirit and can form a fire spirit.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he seemed to have understood something.</p><p>His eyes were bright as he observed his surroundings while fighting.</p><p>fire is not only explosive and destructive. It also contains spirituality and vitality. Fire is the origin of human civilization!</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking in his mind. Unknowingly, the force of fire in his body became more condensed.</p><p>“My Fire Force is about to reach the small success stage.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He didn’t expect that a moment of comprehension would allow his Fire Force to improve by such a large margin.</p><p>Originally, his force of fire was only at the beginner level and could be considered as scratching the surface. Now, he had finally taken a big step forward and was approaching the small success stage.</p><p>The improvement in the force of fire made Lu Ming’s attack stronger. With one sweep of his spear, a large number of flame spirits were swept away.</p><p>At the side, the stunning young lady was secretly shocked. Lu Ming’s comprehension ability surprised her. It was only an inscription formation, but Lu Ming had actually comprehended something in such a short time.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them joined forces and advanced forward. However, there were too many flame spirits, and the battle between them was extremely difficult.</p><p>Half an hour. The two of them had been charging forward for half an hour, crossing thousands of meters. Even with their combat strength, there were still many wounds on their bodies. It could be said to be a tough battle.</p><p>“We’re almost there!”</p><p>The stunning young lady suddenly cried out in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>They had finally reached the end of the cave. In front of them, there was a huge underground cave.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
