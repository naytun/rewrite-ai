We have to take Lu Ming down and give him the harshest punishment!</p><p>The White Tiger Hall disciple roared.</p><p>However, no one was able to get close at the moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re so audacious and arrogant. You’ll die today!”</p><p>A long howl was heard, and three figures rushed over like the wind.</p><p>“Chief elder, three chief elders, Lu Ming is dead for sure.”</p><p>A disciple of the Duanmu family shouted.</p><p>“Kui Fang, you’ve come at the right time. Let’s attack together and take down Lu Ming, that evil creature.”</p><p>Duanmu Chao roared in ecstasy.</p><p>“I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged toward Duanmu Chao.</p><p>Lu yunxiong, on the other hand, was hiding behind Duanmu Chao in fear.</p><p>He had never imagined that Lu Ming would actually dare to attack The White Tiger Hall and kill more than a dozen Grandmaster realm powerhouses in one move.</p><p>How could he be so bold?</p><p>At this moment, even though he was in The White Tiger Hall, he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming charging at him, his face turned even paler and he retreated frantically.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands turned into a pillar that held up the sky and shot toward Duanmu Chao.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Since Lu yunxiong was behind him, he could not retreat. He could only brace himself to receive Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>When he clashed with Lu Ming’s long spear, his body trembled as if he had been electrocuted. He retreated more than ten steps and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>Duanmu Chao roared in shock.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Finally, the three chief elders of The White Tiger Hall arrived. Three terrifying attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, Duanmu Chao charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Four ninth grade great Martial Master realm experts surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and his aura was wild as he fought with four ninth grade great Martial Master experts. His energy swept in all directions and the entire square was in a frenzy.</p><p>Lu Ming was fighting one against four, but he was not at a disadvantage.</p><p>At this moment, even more people had arrived. Not only were there disciples from The White Tiger Hall, but there were also disciples from other halls. When they saw this scene, everyone’s mouth was wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually fight one against four and fight four ninth grade great Martial Master Chief elders. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s assault on The White Tiger Hall spread like wildfire throughout the mystical sword sect.</p><p>……</p><p>Vermillion Bird Hall, Lu Ming’s dormitory.</p><p>At this moment, pang Shi, Mu Lan, and Feng Wu were sitting together in the courtyard. All of them had serious expressions on their faces, as if they were deep in thought.</p><p>it’s all my fault. I should have followed senior brother Lu Ming and the others when they went to pursue the Dongyi tribe. It’s all my fault.</p><p>Pang Shi clenched his fists so tightly that the veins on his arms were visible as he spoke in pain.</p><p>big rock, don’t be silly. This has nothing to do with you. With your cultivation, how could you have followed them? you don’t have to blame yourself.</p><p>Feng Wu said. However, from her pained expression, one could tell that she was very upset.</p><p>“Lu Suan and Lu Ming, did he really fall just like that?”</p><p>Feng Wu sighed in her heart.</p><p>“When the plane collapses, even a martial arts Grandmaster can’t escape death, let alone Lu Ming. I don’t want to believe you either.”</p><p>Mu Lan sighed. Her eyes were filled with grief and sorrow.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is this all you’ve got? Was he just going to leave like this? Originally, I thought that you would grow into a powerful expert. Also, I still owe you a reward. How can you just leave like this!”</p><p>Mu Lan thought to herself.</p><p>“Also, f * ck!”</p><p>Mu Lan gritted her teeth, her eyes misty.</p><p>“Some time ago, the sect has informed Lu Ming’s family. From what I know, Lu Ming’s only close relative is his mother.”</p><p>it can be said that Lu Ming is his mother’s only hope and reliance.</p><p>Feng Wu said.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the atmosphere became even more solemn.</p><p>why don’t we go to senior brother Lu Ming’s house together and visit his mother? I don’t want her to be too sad.</p><p>Pang Shi suggested.</p><p>I think so too. Let’s stay at the Lu residence for a period of time and accompany Lu Ming’s mother.</p><p>Feng Wu also nodded.</p><p>“Then we’ll leave tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>At this moment, the door of the courtyard was pushed open heavily. Two young men ran in, panting heavily.</p><p>“Pang Shi, huh? Elder Mu Lan, it’s great that you’re all here. Something big has happened.”</p><p>A skinny young man with a head full of brawny men said.</p><p>“Bulls, why are you two in such a hurry? What’s the matter? why are you two so anxious?”</p><p>Feng Wu asked with a slight frown.</p><p>These two young men were the same batch of disciples as Lu Ming and were very familiar with pang Shi and the rest.</p><p>Lu Suan, Lu Ming! It’s Lu Ming! He’s back!</p><p>The Bulls panted and shouted.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Mu Lan and Feng Wu’s auras burst out uncontrollably. At the same time, they jumped up from their seats as if they had been electrocuted.</p><p>“F * ck, what did you say? Senior brother Lu Ming was back? Which Lu Ming?”</p><p>Pang Shi’s eyes were wide open, and he was practically roaring.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mu Lan and the rest were also staring at Niu Huan with their eyes wide open. Their eyes were filled with an indescribable hope.</p><p>of course it’s senior brother Lu Ming! He’s ranked first on the bronze ranking!</p><p>The Bulls seemed to be infected by their expressions and also roared.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming! Haha, it was really senior brother Lu Ming? Bulls, are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?”</p><p>Pang Shi laughed and grabbed the Bulls ‘shoulders tightly.</p><p>of course I’m not mistaken. Not only the two of us saw it, but many of our fellow disciples saw it too!</p><p>Another young man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, run!”</p><p>Mu Lan clenched her fists tightly as she muttered to herself. Her body was moving up and down as her beautiful eyes flickered with extreme surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming is not dead. This is great news. Bulls, why are you shouting that something bad has happened?”</p><p>Feng Wu asked after taking a few deep breaths to calm herself down.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming is heading for The White Tiger Hall!”</p><p>The Bulls shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Mu Lan and the other two turned pale with fright.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Mu Lan asked anxiously.</p><p>“I don’t know. We only saw senior brother Lu Ming riding on a huge Eagle and chasing after elder Duanmu Chao from The White Tiger Hall and a man called Lu yunxiong.”</p><p>“I heard senior brother Lu Ming shouting that he must kill Lu yunxiong. Duanmu Chao also shouted that senior brother Lu Ming had killed dozens of experts from the Duanmu family. After that, senior brother Lu Ming and the others went to The White Tiger Hall, and we rushed back.”</p><p>The Bulls said.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong? Oh no, did something happen to the Lu family? Lu yunxiong knows about Lu Ming’s death and he wants to take action against the Lu family?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s expression changed.</p><p>She had stayed in fiery wind city for a long time and was quite familiar with the Lu family’s Affairs, so she could guess the general situation at once.</p><p>“This is bad. Something must have happened to the Lu family. Knowing Lu Ming, he’ll definitely kill Lu yunxiong. However, if he goes to The White Tiger Hall, he’ll definitely die. I’ll get Grandpa to save him now.”</p><p>Mu Lan’s expression was extremely ugly. After saying that, she rushed out in a hurry. With a flash, her figure disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go to The White Tiger Hall!”</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and the others also hurried toward The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
