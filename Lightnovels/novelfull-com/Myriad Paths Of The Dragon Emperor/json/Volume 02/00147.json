It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>When he arrived at the mission Hall, he easily received a mission. After receiving the mission token, Lu Ming rushed towards East lacking city.</p><p>He didn’t ride on his Mount, but used his movement technique to rush over.</p><p>With his current movement technique, he was much faster than the green scale horse, and the process of rushing was also the process of cultivating his movement technique.</p><p>Using the high-air steps, Lu Ming’s body was like a breeze, light as if he was weightless. He stepped on the grass with the tips of his toes and his body flew forward dozens of meters. He was as agile as a Swan and his figure disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At such a speed, Lu Ming arrived outside of dongque city in just three days.</p><p>Dongque city was undoubtedly a big city. The city wall was more than 30 meters high, which was many times larger than fiery wind city.</p><p>At this moment, the city gate of dongque city was tightly shut. The city wall was heavily guarded by soldiers in iron armor.</p><p>“Stop! Who are you?”</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the city gate, an armored general on the city wall asked loudly.</p><p>“I am a disciple of the mystical sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his identity Jade card and waved it gently. The identity Jade card flew up to the city wall.</p><p>“It really is a disciple of the mystical sword sect. Open the gates!”</p><p>The armored general looked at the identity Jade card and threw it back to Lu Ming. Then, he gave his instructions.</p><p>Ka ka …</p><p>The city gate opened and Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered, the city gate was immediately closed.</p><p>Behind the city gate, there were many armored soldiers, more than the ones on the city wall.</p><p>Dongque city was guarded by an Army of the blazing sun Empire. They had 50000 soldiers, all of whom were elites. Their purpose was to intimidate the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Now that the royal family was on the decline and the sects were on the rise, the armies of the blazing sun Empire might still listen to the royal family on the surface, but in reality, they were more inclined to listen to a single sect.</p><p>For example, the Army of the East scarce city seemed to be under the command of the royal family, but in fact, they were under the command of the mystical sword sect. Therefore, whenever something happened, they would report it to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Young hero, the mystical sword sect’s disciples are all in the first camp. Let me take you there.”</p><p>A soldier walked to Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He followed the soldier and headed to Camp No. 1.</p><p>As soon as he entered the camp, he heard a clamor.</p><p>what a joke. You guys aren’t even fourth grade master realm, yet you dare to take on this mission? are you guys crazy for contribution points? ”</p><p>do you really want to die? let me tell you, if you embarrass the mystical sword sect on the battlefield, I won’t let you off.</p><p>“A few pieces of trash below the fourth grade master realm. Hmph, no one will save you when the time comes.”</p><p>……</p><p>A series of arrogant voices entered Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the sound and walked over.</p><p>As he walked closer, he saw a few groups of people gathered together. All of them were young, and with a single look, he could tell that they were disciples of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Stone oaf!”</p><p>Lu Ming spotted pang Shi among the small group of people at one glance.</p><p>At this moment, pang Shi’s face was flushed red. He was with three or four other people and was blocked by another group of people.</p><p>We are indeed weak, but we won’t be in the front. We can at least go and kill some scattered Dongyi people, right? ”</p><p>Pang Shi said in a low, muffled voice.</p><p>“Kill the scattered Dongyi? So, you’re here to take advantage of us. Get the hell back to the sect now. The White Tiger Hall’s benefits aren’t something you can take advantage of!”</p><p>A young man with triangular-shaped eyes shouted from across pang Shi.</p><p>“Nonsense, who said we’re taking advantage of them? I won’t take advantage of you.”</p><p>Pang Shi replied loudly.</p><p>The triangular-eyed youth’s eyes turned cold as he said, ” “How dare you talk back? are you looking for a beating?”</p><p>There were a few other mystical sword sect disciples at the side, but none of them interfered. They were all just watching the show.</p><p>“Looking for a beating? Who can you beat?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and said indifferently.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The triangular-eyed young man shouted coldly. His bright eyes turned to look at Lu Ming. However, when he saw Lu Ming’s appearance, his expression froze.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming!”</p><p>The triangular eyed youth said in a daze.</p><p>The others ‘expressions also changed slightly.</p><p>However, there were also some people who were watching with interest. This time, there were not only bronze disciples, but also many silver disciples.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’re here too.”</p><p>Pang Shi was overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stone oaf!” Lu Ming smiled and walked over.</p><p>Then, he looked at the triangular-eyed young man and said, ” “Just now, who did you say you were going to hit?”</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>The triangular-eyed young man stammered for a long time but did not say a word.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Junior Brother Ming is doing this for their own good. They’re disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall, right? Their cultivation is too low, not even a fourth grade master realm. It’s very dangerous for them to go to the battlefield with such a cultivation. Junior Brother Ming is thinking for their safety.”</p><p>At this moment, a young man walked up from behind triangle eyes.</p><p>“Yes, that’s it!”</p><p>After seeing this young man, the triangular-eyed young man’s courage grew.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lu Ming replied and then asked the triangular-eyed man, ” “What’s your cultivation level?”</p><p>“Me? A peak sixth grade master realm!”</p><p>Triangular eyes replied confidently.</p><p>“Only sixth grade master realm? It’s very dangerous to go to the battlefield with such a low cultivation. Hurry up and get lost.”</p><p>I’m doing this for your own good, ” Lu Ming said faintly. He even added at the end.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Triangular-eyes ‘face turned red.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t twist your words.”</p><p>Another young man shouted coldly.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are?” Lu Ming gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p>how dare you, Lu Ming? don’t think that you can be so arrogant just because you’re the first on the bronze rank. No matter how talented you are, you can only show off your power among the bronze rank disciples. Senior brother du is a silver rank disciple and a second grade great Martial Master. He can easily suppress you. Now that I’m talking to you nicely, don’t be ungrateful.</p><p>The triangular-eyed young man pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely powerful, he was only at the master realm after all.</p><p>Even though he had heaven-defying talent and could defeat or even kill a first grade great Martial Master, he was still a genius.</p><p>However, the first grade and second grade of the great Martial Master realm were two different concepts.</p><p>A first grade great Martial Master facing a second grade great Martial Master, he had almost no power to fight back. This was the basis of the triangular-eyed young man’s confidence. He did not believe that Lu Ming could fight a second grade great Martial Master.</p><p>“Second grade great master realm? No wonder he’s so arrogant.”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth twitched slightly. He sneered and waved his palm.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The triangular-eyed youth’s body was sent flying.</p><p>“I just don’t know how to appreciate your kindness, so what?” Lu Ming’s faint voice was heard. It was accompanied by a loud thud. The triangular-eyed young man landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re too arrogant. Do you really think that no one can stop you?”</p><p>Senior brother DU’s face was gloomy. Lu Ming did not give him any face at all. He had slapped triangle-eyes in front of him. That was an indirect slap to his face.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
