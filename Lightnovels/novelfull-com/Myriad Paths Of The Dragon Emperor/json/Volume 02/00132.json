The number of demonic beasts gradually increased here. At any time, one could see demonic beasts of Class 7,8, and even 9 of Class 2 rushing by.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A five-meter tall, majestic earth-shattering bear pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The earth-shattering bear was at Class 9 Lv 2.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The fiery Tung spear transformed into a ray of light and pierced through the earth-shattering bear’s chest.</p><p>The earth-shattering bear roared a few times before it fell heavily to the ground and stopped breathing.</p><p>He controlled his bloodline and devoured the earth-shattering bear’s blood essence. Not long after, he refined it.</p><p>Now that he had cultivated the true war Dragon technique to the third stage, the energy required to increase his cultivation was even more terrifying. The blood essence of a class 9 Lv 2 demonic beast was really insignificant.</p><p>“This earth-shattering bear’s fur is valuable, but it’s too troublesome to skin it, so I’ll pass.”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Many materials from the demonic beasts were valuable but it was troublesome to clean them up. Lu Ming usually did not care about them.</p><p>In his opinion, he would rather spend this time cultivating and killing more demonic beasts to devour their blood essence.</p><p>it’s said that when a demonic beast reaches the great Martial Master realm, a demonic core will be formed in its body. It’s a good material for alchemy and weapons. We can collect it.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>At this moment, a hissing sound was heard. At the same time, a disgusting stench was emitted.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>There was a strong gust of wind and a black shadow came crashing down on Lu Ming from the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he instantly floated back thirty meters to avoid the attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spot where Lu Ming was standing earlier was heavily hit by the black shadow. Rocks flew everywhere and a ten-meter long ravine appeared.</p><p>“What a huge snake!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>A pungent smell assailed his nostrils. A giant snake that was thicker than a water tank and more than thirty meters long appeared before Lu Ming.</p><p>Its entire body was covered in black scales, and its eyes were red. When it stood up, it was six meters tall.</p><p>It was the tail of the Python that had smashed at him.</p><p>iron-scaled giant python. It seems that it has reached the first grade of Level 3.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>The iron-scaled giant python hissed, then its strong and powerful body bounced and pounced toward Lu Ming at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“Sky step!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s toes moved and his body seemed to be weightless. He floated up and appeared on the iron-scaled giant Python’s head like a Phantom.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>The long spear smashed down on the iron-scaled giant Python’s head with a terrifying force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear landed heavily on the Python’s head.</p><p>The iron-scaled giant python hissed and its huge body was sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>It rolled dozens of meters away, and seven or eight trees that were large enough for several people to wrap their arms around were crushed by the Python.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>The iron-scaled giant python struggled to get up. There was a gash on its head, and blood was flowing out. It looked at Lu Ming with fear in its eyes.</p><p>as expected of a first tier third level iron-scaled giant python. Its defense is really strong.</p><p>Lu Ming licked his lips, feeling a little dissatisfied.</p><p>If others were to see this, they would probably die of jealousy.</p><p>This was a level-three demonic beast, which was equivalent to the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Moreover, iron-scaled pythons were known for their strong defense. To put it bluntly, if it was an ordinary ninth grade master realm martial artist, even if the iron-scaled Python didn’t resist and just lay there for them to attack, they wouldn’t be able to break its defense.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had severely injured the iron-scaled giant python with one shot and he was still not satisfied?</p><p>The iron-scaled giant python began to retreat and turned to run.</p><p>“You want to run? Leave behind the monster core and blood essence!”</p><p>It was not easy for him to encounter a first grade third level demonic beast. Naturally, Lu Ming would not let it go.</p><p>His body moved and he charged towards the iron-scaled giant python.</p><p>A few minutes later, the iron-scaled giant Python’s corpse was lying in the forest. Its head had been pierced by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>I have no problem killing a first grade great Martial Master with my current combat strength. I wonder if I can kill a second grade great Martial Master? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>After the battle with the iron-scaled giant python, Lu Ming had a clearer understanding of his own combat strength.</p><p>Even a normal first grade great Martial Master wouldn’t be able to resist him.</p><p>However, the gap between each grade of the great Martial Master realm was even greater, much greater than the gap between the first grade of the Martial Master realm. Therefore, Lu Ming would not jump to conclusions about the second grade great Martial Master realm without fighting them.</p><p>He immediately controlled his bloodline and devoured the iron-scaled giant Python’s blood essence.</p><p>as expected of a class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast. The essence of its blood is much stronger than that of a class 2 demonic beast.</p><p>Feeling the waves of energy in his blood, Lu Ming absorbed and refined it with all his might.</p><p>His cultivation base was clearly growing rapidly.</p><p>The blood essence of a class 1 Lv 3 demonic beast was a dozen times more than that of a class 9 Lv 2 demonic beast.</p><p>When all the blood essence was refined, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the peak of the early ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a burst of bloody light burst out of his spirit-devouring bloodline, and a fifth chakra emerged on top of the original four chakra.</p><p>His bloodline had advanced to the fifth level.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Ever since he had advanced to the fourth level, his Blood Meridian had not leveled up for a long time. During this period, he had devoured so much blood essence.</p><p>Finally, now that he had accumulated enough, he advanced another level.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>When the fifth level bloodline was activated, the speed at which it absorbed spiritual energy from heaven and earth was greatly increased.</p><p>Moreover, the speed of devouring and refining blood essence would be faster and stronger.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming took out a sword and dug out a Pearl the size of a longan from the Python’s body.</p><p>This was the iron-scaled giant Python’s demonic core, which contained a huge amount of energy.</p><p>Apart from the blood essence, it was the part of a demonic beast that contained the most energy.</p><p>It could be said that 80% of a demonic beast’s energy was in its blood essence and demonic core.</p><p>the demonic core contains a lot of energy. Alchemists can use it to refine pills, but it has more impurities than blood essence. Can my bloodline devour and refine it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of this problem.</p><p>His bloodline was very special. Back in the dark blood Mountain, his bloodline could even devour and refine the highly toxic red liquid. Could the monster core do the same?</p><p>If possible, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed would increase by another level.</p><p>He no longer had to worry about not having enough energy to cultivate due to his cultivation of the true war Dragon technique becoming more and more profound.</p><p>Moreover, demonic cores of the same level were much cheaper than blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming put his thoughts into action. He entered the Supreme shrine and controlled his Blood Meridian.</p><p>A powerful devouring force was produced. With a swish, the demonic core in Lu Ming’s hand was directly devoured by the soul-devouring bloodline.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>Then, his blood vessels let out a sizzling sound. After a while, a huge amount of energy essence gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“It’s really possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. He immediately circulated the true war Dragon technique and started cultivating.</p><p>Half an hour later, the demonic core had been completely refined.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the middle ninth grade master realm.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He realized that the demon core had improved his cultivation more than the blood essence.</p><p>This was because the bloodline would devour half of the energy in the blood essence, but the monster core would not. It was completely used to improve cultivation.</p><p>However, refining the demon pill was slower than refining the blood essence, but these were all small problems.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
