The power of fire exploded. Combined with the fire controlling spear art, the power was terrifying.</p><p>As he waved his spear, it was like a volcano erupting. A scorching aura filled the air and enveloped the thin black-robed man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The skinny black-robed man tried his best to resist, but he was still swept by the scorching aura. His black bamboo hat suddenly burst open, revealing the face under the black robe.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. It was a woman’s face.</p><p>She was about fifteen or sixteen years old and looked even younger than Lu Ming. She had an oval face, Willow-shaped eyebrows, round, watery almond-shaped eyes, and skin that was whiter than snow. She was actually a woman of unparalleled beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming initially thought that it would be a skinny old man. He did not expect it to be a stunning young lady. He could not help but be stunned.</p><p>“Hmph! I didn’t think that a small Empire like the burning sun Empire would have a genius like you. A second grade great Martial Master was actually able to shatter my bamboo hat. Since that’s the case, I won’t hide anymore. I’ll show you my true strength.”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s voice was clear and melodious, like beads falling onto a Jade plate. It was very pleasant to the ear, but at this time, her voice was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The beautiful woman pulled off her black robe. The black robe was torn apart, and it fluttered in the air like black butterflies, revealing the young girl’s delicate figure.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in the mood to appreciate it because the young girl had already launched a fierce attack on him.</p><p>“Heavenly demon power, chaotic dance of the demonic Lotus!”</p><p>die! the beautiful girl shouted. Black genuine Qi surged around her body, forming black lotuses around her.</p><p>Then, the young lady waved her hands and the Black Lotus flower spread out. The black petals pierced through the air and flew toward Lu Ming with an ear-piercing whistling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew what technique the young girl had used to kill the elder of the Dongyi tribe. It was these petals. However, the speed of these petals was obviously faster and there were more of them.</p><p>“Fire dance!”</p><p>The long spear swayed and flames appeared around Lu Ming.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>Rapid clashing sounds rang out, and in a few breaths, more than a hundred strikes had been made.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that every time they clashed, the power from the black flower petals was shocking. After clashing for more than a hundred times, even with Lu Ming’s cultivation, he felt his arm go numb.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>The stunning young lady shouted. She kicked her legs slightly and her body soared into the sky, striking out a few palm strikes at Lu Ming.</p><p>Three black palm prints were lined up, one in front and one behind, tearing through the air and heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear forward. The tip of the spear spun, bringing with it a powerful spinning cutting force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The first palm print was destroyed by Lu Ming, but his body swayed and he could not help but take two steps back. However, the second palm print had already arrived.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>He continued to cast the same move and destroyed the second palm print. However, Lu Ming retreated eight steps in a row, his face pale.</p><p>Immediately, the third palm print followed.</p><p>“Landslide! Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and swept his long spear. The spear body shook and collided with the third hand seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As if struck by lightning, Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he retreated more than a dozen steps. His qi and blood were in turmoil. He felt something sweet in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>he’s too strong! Where did this genius come from? ”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was shocked beyond words.</p><p>Before this, the girl’s aura was hazy. Although she looked strong, no one could see her cultivation. However, when she used the demonic palm print, she finally revealed her cultivation.</p><p>Second grade great master realm.</p><p>This stunning young lady’s cultivation was the same as Lu Ming’s, at the second grade Grandmaster realm. However, her combat strength was terrifyingly strong, and she could actually suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s true war Dragon technique had been cultivated to the third level and he had comprehended the force of fire, he was actually suppressed in a battle of the same level with such powerful combat strength?</p><p>“Force. This girl has also comprehended force, and her level of controlling force is definitely higher than mine. She’s also very powerful in other aspects. No, from her tone, she shouldn’t be from the burning sun Empire.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>not bad, kid. I didn’t expect that there would be a second grade great Martial Master in the blazing sun Empire who could block my demonic palm. I’m starting to feel pity for you. How about this? if you leave now, I’ll spare your life!</p><p>The stunning young lady looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“The victor hasn’t been decided yet? I don’t have the habit of admitting defeat easily!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Hmph! I just complimented you, and you’re so arrogant. I’ll show you the difference between us!”</p><p>The young girl snorted coldly. She moved and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“So fast, this is the force of the wind!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and he suddenly swept his long spear horizontally.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and then started fighting again.</p><p>It had to be said that the stunning young lady’s combat strength was very terrifying. Other than not using his Blood Meridian, Lu Ming had already used all his strength. However, he was still completely suppressed by the young lady.</p><p>After only seven or eight moves, Lu Ming was completely outmatched. Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>The girl’s voice was very cold as she sent out a few demonic palm imprints.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. A blood-red light flashed on his body as his Blood Meridian burst out.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming ignored the demonic palm print and dashed toward the young girl.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three black palm prints landed on Lu Ming’s body in a row. However, Lu Ming’s body only trembled. He gritted his teeth and rushed toward the young lady.</p><p>The young girl was stunned. She had never expected that Lu Ming could withstand her demonic palm imprint.</p><p>By the time she came to her senses, Lu Ming was already in front of her.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear was thrust out as fast as lightning, but the young girl’s reaction was also very fast. She waved her palm and smacked Lu Ming’s long spear to the side.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s momentum did not stop and he continued to crash into the young girl.</p><p>At the same time, his palm glowed and the long spear disappeared. Lu Ming’s claw was aimed at the young girl’s throat.</p><p>This time, the young girl could no longer Dodge and was caught in Lu Ming’s arms. At the same time, Lu Ming’s fingers grabbed her throat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s fingers did not reach for it because a dagger had appeared in the young girl’s hand out of nowhere and she was pressing it against Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming exerted force in his claws, the young girl’s dagger could instantly pierce through Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>On the other hand, the young lady did not dare to stab him with her dagger. If she exerted any force, Lu Ming’s claw would instantly break her throat.</p><p>The two of them were in a stalemate.</p><p>However, their posture was really strange.</p><p>Lu Ming clasped the young lady’s neck with one hand and hugged her slender waist with the other.</p><p>The young lady’s hands seemed to be hugging Lu Ming. She held a dagger in one hand and pointed it at Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
