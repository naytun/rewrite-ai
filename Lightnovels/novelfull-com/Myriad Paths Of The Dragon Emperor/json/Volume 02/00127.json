He’s breaking through in the middle of a great battle. This is crazy!</p><p>The crowd was already boiling.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually made a breakthrough in the middle of an intense battle. How strong and determined did he need to be to achieve this?</p><p>Ordinary people simply couldn’t do it.</p><p>“Breakthrough? No, that’s not right. In that case, Lu Ming did not reach ninth grade master realm before?”</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Many of the disciples looked at each other. It was only then that they realized that Lu Ming had not reached the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming’s performance was too strong, and his true Qi was condensed and strong. Most of the disciples of the four courtyards naturally thought that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Other than a few silver-robed elders and above who had already seen through it, most of the disciples thought so.</p><p>Now, he suddenly realized that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the eighth grade master realm. This was too unbelievable.</p><p>All of them stood there with their mouths agape.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The spirit Qi between heaven and earth continued to gather towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body rose rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s momentum was like a rainbow. He had officially stepped into the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, even if you have a breakthrough in your cultivation, what’s the use? You’re destined to lose today!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang roared after a brief moment of shock.</p><p>“Oh, really? LAN Yue!”</p><p>After stepping into the ninth grade master realm, Lu Ming’s essential Qi had doubled. The long spear swept out, and a thunderous sound was heard.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As the spear swept across, the blood leopards exploded in the air one by one, but they continued to condense, but their speed was much slower than before.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s move wasn’t unbreakable. As long as the power reached a certain level, it would also collapse.</p><p>Just like Zhang Muyun’s control force, he destroyed this move in one move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve forced me to do this. Blood exterminating slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang roared and spat out a mouthful of blood. There was even a drop of blood essence in the blood.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was going all out. He could not accept being defeated by Lu Ming. He had even forced out a drop of blood essence.</p><p>One must know that there were only nine drops of blood essence in the human body. It was extremely difficult to recover after using one drop. This was a matter that would greatly damage one’s vitality.</p><p>The blood condensed in the air and turned into blood leopards that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>These blood leopards were more solid than the previous ones and were more powerful.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to break this! Go to hell!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang laughed crazily. The killing intent in his eyes was extremely cold.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He held his spear and stood quietly on the fighting ring. He looked indifferently at the blood leopard that was pouncing at him and muttered,”Duanmu Yunyang, my cultivation base has already broken through. It’s time to end this farce!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was stunned.</p><p>The Presidents of the four great academies, the silver-robed elders, and the disciples of the four great academies were all stunned!</p><p>“A farce? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>But in the next moment, they knew what it meant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly burst out from Lu Ming’s body. The aura was brutal and powerful.</p><p>Everyone seemed to see a volcano erupting, and hot lava spewed out, wreaking havoc in the world.</p><p>Force, the force of fire!</p><p>All the disciples, silver-robed elders, and Deans of the four great academies widened their eyes and mouths in disbelief as they looked at the tall figure on the fighting ring.</p><p>The air seemed to have frozen at this moment, and the entire place was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually comprehended the control force. It was too shocking.</p><p>It was already shocking enough that Zhang Muyun could comprehend force. However, he had already been in the sect for more than three years. But he had just entered this year.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The surging aura, combined with his martial arts technique, turned into a spear ray and blasted out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blood leopards that were pouncing towards Lu Ming were instantly crushed and dissipated into the air. The Spear’s radiance continued to bombard Duanmu Yunyang’s body. Duanmu Yunyang let out a blood-curdling scream and was sent flying far away.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang has been defeated!”</p><p>It was not known who shouted, but it instantly ignited the entire scene, and the entire place fell into a clamor.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun muttered as he stood up from his seat. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>The four Chiefs and the sect leaders also stood up from their seats. Their eyes flickered, and their expressions were different.</p><p>“Impossible? Impossible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Lu yunxiong and Lu Yao kept shaking their heads, finding it hard to accept this.</p><p>“Argh! Why? Why?”</p><p>On the battle stage, Duanmu Yunyang was struggling to get up. His hair was disheveled and he was shouting hysterically. He couldn’t bear all this.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Duanmu Yunyang indifferently and said,”Duanmu Yunyang, weren’t you very confident before that you would never lose to me and that it would be the biggest joke in the world to lose to me? then, what about now?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and glared at Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>“Duanmu Yunyang, you’re arrogant and conceited. You have no regard for anyone and keep saying that you want to take back the glory that belongs to you. Other than relying on your family, what are you? Without the Duanmu family, you are nothing.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s every word was like a sharp blade, stabbing into Duanmu Yunyang’s heart.</p><p>“No, no, it’s not like that. You’re talking nonsense, you’re talking nonsense. How could this be?”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s hair was disheveled as he shouted like a mad man.</p><p>Previously, he was extremely overbearing and confident. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all and thought that he would never lose.</p><p>However, the reality was that he was defeated in front of everyone. To a proud person like him, it was a huge blow.</p><p>“Lu Ming, shut up!”</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster bellowed, his voice booming like thunder.</p><p>“Yunyang, wake up!”</p><p>The headmaster of The White Tiger Hall wanted to use the same old trick to wake Duanmu Yunyang up.</p><p>Unfortunately, Duanmu Yunyang didn’t regain his consciousness like before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He ignored The White Tiger Hall’s Dean and shouted,”Duanmu Yunyang, you will never be my opponent after today’s defeat. Furthermore, you are not worthy of being my opponent!”</p><p>You’re not worthy to be my opponent!</p><p>These words directly struck the depths of Duanmu Yunyang’s heart.</p><p>“No, I won’t. I’m invincible!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang let out a loud cry. His eyes turned red, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, he fell to the ground and fainted.</p><p>“Damn it, you little bastard, I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>The White Tiger Hall’s Dean was furious. An aura as deep as the ocean rose from his body, powerful to the extreme, and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ming felt as if he was being crushed by a huge mountain. He was unparalleled. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his figure was pushed back dozens of meters.</p><p>“Duanmu pojun, what are you doing?”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall chief was furious. He also released a powerful aura to block The White Tiger Hall chief’s aura.</p><p>“What are you doing? Lu Ming, that little b * stard, deliberately destroyed Yunyang’s state of mind and ruined his martial arts path. He deserves to be punished and killed!”</p><p>The headmaster of The White Tiger Hall roared.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
