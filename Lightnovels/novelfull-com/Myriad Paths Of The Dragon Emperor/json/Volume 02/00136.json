Just Prick Up Your Ears and listen. The three of us are all Qilin Hall’s disciples.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said arrogantly.</p><p>“What? A disciple of the Qilin Hall!”</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped in shock.</p><p>These people were actually geniuses from Qilin Hall?</p><p>Although Qilin Hall was one of the five halls of the mystical sword sect, it had always been a mysterious place. The outside world had no idea how many disciples it had or how many disciples it accepted every year. Even many silver-robed elders had no idea.</p><p>Jian wuchen and the others were enjoying the sight of everyone’s shock.</p><p>They loved to see the shocked expressions of others. They had a special bloodline and were born noble. They were born to enjoy the respect, envy, and shock of others.</p><p>This kind of feeling made them feel very comfortable.</p><p>“Oh, you’re the disciples of Qilin Palace. If you’re here to congratulate me on my engagement, please take a seat. If not, please leave. We’ll talk about it another day!”</p><p>Even in front of Qilin Hall’s disciples, Zhang Muyun’s tone was still the same, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s tone made Jian wuchen and the other two’s faces sink.</p><p>“Another day? Why did he have to do it another day? We’ve chosen the date of your engagement to come here today. I heard that most of your so-called bronze rank people are here today, so we don’t have to look for them one by one!”</p><p>recently, I heard that the people on the bronze ranking of the four great academies are known as the strongest geniuses in the master realm. I found it very funny, so I came here to show you what the true strongest master is. Your so-called strongest master is nothing but trash in front of us.</p><p>Jian wuchen laughed indifferently and his tone was filled with disdain.</p><p>Some of the geniuses on the bronze list were shocked.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list were indeed the strongest in the master realm. Each of them had strong combat strength and could defeat an ordinary ninth grade master realm expert with one move.</p><p>But now, a few people from Qilin Hall were calling them trash?</p><p>All geniuses were proud. Although the people in front of them were disciples of Qilin Hall, some of the people on the bronze list looked at them coldly.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to fight? that’s good, I want to see how much you can do.”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man sneered, then looked at Wu kui with an exaggerated expression, ” “Are you also on the bronze list?”</p><p>Wu kui’s face turned red. He had just been defeated in one move, so he found it hard to speak.</p><p>Seeing Wu kui’s expression, the saber-hugging young man laughed exaggeratedly, ” “Haha, so you’re really on the bronze list. How can trash like you be on the bronze list? Senior martial brother Jian, I’ve told you that the disciples of the four halls are all trash. What bronze ranking? I think they’re all the same. I’m not interested in them at all.”</p><p>“Detestable, arrogant!”</p><p>“You only defeated Wu kui, do you really think you’re invincible?”</p><p>The saber-wielding young man’s words caused a wave of angry roars.</p><p>Not only the geniuses on the bronze list, but many silver disciples and even the elders were also displeased.</p><p>Because of what the saber-hugging young man had said, he had scolded the four schools.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man shouted coldly. His eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings. With a mocking expression, he said,”If you want to prove that you’re not trash, then make your move. As long as you can defeat me.”</p><p>There was a sudden silence. Everyone looked at each other, but no one stepped out.</p><p>These young men were obviously at the master realm, and the silver disciples could not fight them.</p><p>Judging from the saber-wielding young man’s attack just now, he was simply unfathomable. The geniuses on the bronze list were also afraid of him. They all wanted someone else to test the saber-wielding young man’s strength first, so they didn’t make a move for a while.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother Liu, you’re too strong. How would they dare to make a move? I’m more than enough to deal with the trash from the four courtyards.”</p><p>Among the three young men, the strongest young man walked out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the young man’s aura grew and his cultivation was revealed.</p><p>The early stage of the ninth grade master realm. Everyone could tell at a glance that this well-built young man had just advanced to the early stage of the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>“I’m a new disciple this year, and I’ve just broken through to the ninth grade master realm. Geniuses on the bronze list, come and fight me. I hope you don’t even dare to fight me. ”</p><p>The well-built young man said with a mocking smile.</p><p>The people on the bronze list were even angrier.</p><p>This was an insult, a blatant insult.</p><p>He actually allowed a disciple who had just entered the sect this year, a disciple who had just broken through to the ninth grade master realm not long ago, to challenge them. This was completely disrespecting them.</p><p>“I’m here to fight you.”</p><p>A young man on the bronze ranking list walked out.</p><p>The crowd immediately recognized him as Xu Xuan, who was ranked 42nd on the bronze list.</p><p>He was one rank higher in the martial arts competition.</p><p>“What’s your rank on the bronze list?”</p><p>The well-built youth asked.</p><p>“Forty-two!” Xu Han said.</p><p>“Forty-two? Do you want to fight me and defeat you in one move?”</p><p>The well-built young man smiled faintly.</p><p>“One move?”</p><p>Xu Xuan’s face was extremely dark, this burly young man really did not put him in his eyes.</p><p>Even if he was a genius from Qilin Hall, he was only a new disciple this year. How could he claim that he could defeat him in one move? what a joke. Did he think he was Lu Ming?</p><p>“Then let’s see how you’re going to defeat me in one move?”</p><p>die! Xu Xuan roared and stepped forward with a long spear in his hand. The long spear pierced through the air and let out an ear-piercing whistle.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>“Defeat!”</p><p>Xu Xuan spat out a word and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was filled with black light. The well-built young man’s fist seemed to be made of a piece of metal or a Black Sun, emitting sharp rays of light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist landed on Xu Xuan’s spear, and a deafening boom was heard.</p><p>In the next moment, the well-built young man’s fist shot out beams of black light, destroying all of Xu Xuan’s defense and attack.</p><p>arghh! Xu Xuan cried out in pain as his body was sent flying. He crashed heavily onto the ground, his body covered in blood.</p><p>Defeated. Xu Ke had lost. He had been defeated by his opponent in one move. His outcome was exactly the same as Wu kui’s.</p><p>Gasps could be heard from the audience.</p><p>Was this the genius of Qilin Hall? Wasn’t he too strong? He actually defeated Xu Xuan in one move. Was he really a new disciple this year?</p><p>It was no wonder that three of the four great geniuses of the mystical sword sect came from Qilin Hall, and only Duanmu Lin had managed to occupy a spot with his peerless talent.</p><p>It was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Can’t even withstand a single blow, what trash.”</p><p>The well-built youth sneered.</p><p>when there are no Tigers in the mountains, the monkeys will be the Kings. What bronze ranking? what the strongest group of martial masters? they’re all trash. They’re just children playing house. They’re like mud. When they meet a real genius, they’re nothing.</p><p>Jian wuchen laughed lightly, his voice full of mockery.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
