From BA he’s words, he could tell something.</p><p>Bach had clearly said ‘a small burning sun Empire’, but before he could finish, he had moved away.</p><p>This was very strange. If he was from the Dongyi tribe, he would never say this. Could it be that BA he was not from the Dongyi tribe? He wasn’t even from the burning sun Empire?</p><p>But if he wasn’t from the burning sun Empire, what was he doing with the Dongyi tribe?</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were flying.</p><p>The people from the mystical sword sect all had unsightly expressions on their faces. For a moment, no one else stepped up to fight.</p><p>There were a few fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts present, but they were all rather old, far older than 22 years old. If they were to fight, they would become a joke.</p><p>The soldiers on the city wall were also silent.</p><p>In their eyes, the mystical sword sect was a Holy Land of martial arts where experts were as common as clouds.</p><p>But now, a genius from the mystical sword sect was being suppressed by a young man from the Dongyi tribe. This was a huge blow to their confidence, and their morale plummeted.</p><p>Fu Liang’s eyes were filled with anxiety. It would not be good if this continued.</p><p>“Report!”</p><p>Suddenly, a soldier came to report.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Fu Liang asked.</p><p>city Lord, we have made a major discovery. The Dongyi tribe has sent out a group of people. They are a thousand miles South of dongque city and are heading towards nine demon mountain.</p><p>The soldier reported.</p><p>“What? Could it be that the Dongyi people are here under false pretense and have sent an Army to attack the other cities?”</p><p>“How many people did the Dongyi tribe send?” Fu Liang was shocked and quickly asked.</p><p>“Not many, I think there are only a few hundred.”</p><p>The soldier replied.</p><p>“Hundreds of people?” Fu Liang was stunned. What was the use of hundreds of people?</p><p>city Lord, it is said that these hundreds of people are all strong, and the worst is a high-level Martial Master.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Fu Liang was shocked and frowned.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect were also puzzled.</p><p>the Dongyi tribe must have a purpose for doing this. We must stop them.</p><p>One of the mystical sword sect disciples said.</p><p>that’s right, but the other side is a master. I guess there are many great martial masters. If we want to stop them, we can only rely on you young heroes.</p><p>Fu Liang cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>The mystical sword sect disciple nodded.</p><p>however, we have to get rid of that young man. Otherwise, it will be a huge blow to our morale. If the other party attacks with all their might, we will be at a disadvantage.</p><p>Fu Liang sighed.</p><p>The people from the mystical sword sect frowned again.</p><p>“The other party is deliberately delaying our time. Something big must have happened there. We have to hurry over.”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but forget the past.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>“Lu Ming? He was going to make a move? Did he really break through to the great Martial Master realm?”</p><p>even if I’ve broken through to the great Martial Master realm, I’m still no match for him. He’s a peak second grade great Martial Master, and he’s obviously a top genius.</p><p>there might be hope. A few days ago, I saw Lu Ming send Du Feng flying with one punch.</p><p>“Just let him try.”</p><p>When the mystical sword sect disciples saw that it was Lu Ming who spoke, they could not help but whisper among themselves.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and stepped forward.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>Pang Shi called out from behind. Lu Ming smiled and leaped off the city wall.</p><p>Among the mystical sword sect disciples, there was a pair of resentful eyes glaring at Lu Ming. It was Du Feng.</p><p>That day, he was injured by a punch and became a laughing stock. He was humiliated and resented Lu Ming.</p><p>Just a moment ago, he had been mentioned by others. At this moment, he was roaring in his heart. haha, Lu Ming, go to hell. You think you’re a genius? do you think you’re more powerful than Lu Tian? it’s good that you’ve been killed, you arrogant fellow.</p><p>Beside him, the triangular-eyed young man also had a look of resentment. The few of them squeezed forward desperately, wanting to see Lu Ming being killed by BA he with their own eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was as light as a swallow. It did not take long for him to arrive in front of BA he.</p><p>haha, I beat up the older one, and now an even younger one has come. Kid, since you’re here, I won’t show any mercy with my saber.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s age, BA he was slightly stunned. Then, he revealed a mocking look.</p><p>“You’re not from the burning sun Empire, are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer the question but BA he’s expression changed.</p><p>“Speak, what are you doing here? Also, what is the purpose of the Dongyi people going to the nine demon mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>BA he’s face changed several times and he sneered: ” you don’t have to worry about that. Anyway, it’s useless even if you know, because you’re going to die soon.</p><p>“Then why aren’t you making a move? I know you’re just trying to stall for time, but I don’t have that much time to waste with you.”</p><p>With that, the storage ring on Lu Ming’s finger glowed and the fire Tung spear appeared in his hand. His aura also burst out.</p><p>“First grade great Martial Master realm? Hahaha, a first grade great Martial Master dares to come and court death? You’re too naive.”</p><p>BA he looked at Lu Ming’s cultivation and laughed hysterically. He laughed so hard that he almost cried.</p><p>On the city wall, Fu Liang kept shaking his head.</p><p>Previously, when he looked at Lu Ming’s age, he already felt that something was wrong. He was too young. Now, he saw that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the first grade great Martial Master realm. Although it was already very shocking to have such cultivation at this age, he was still a first grade great Martial Master after all. How could he be BA he’s opponent?</p><p>“Young hero, come back quickly. We’ll think of another way.”</p><p>Fu Liang shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming was so young and he had such a cultivation. He was definitely a top genius in the mystical sword sect. If he were to die Here, he was afraid that the mystical sword sect would blame him.</p><p>“City Lord Fu, don’t worry. Our Junior Brother Lu Ming is very powerful. He’s a peerless genius. Who knows, he might be able to kill BA he?”</p><p>Du Feng laughed in a strange manner. However, everyone could hear the gloating and mocking tone in his voice.</p><p>“Haha, since you’ve come down, how can you leave?”</p><p>BA he’s saber was unsheathed. A cold killing intent surged from his body and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated. He could not be bothered to say more and swept his long spear out.</p><p>“I’ll kill you with a single slash.”</p><p>BA he’s voice was cold and the gleam of the blade was even colder. It was as fast as lightning as it slashed towards Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Accurately, the saber slashed at Lu Ming’s neck. However, at this moment, BA he was shocked because it was only a shadow.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>He let out a low roar, and black true Qi burst out from his body. He pushed off with his feet and rushed forward without hesitation.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A spearlight pierced his ear, and the cold spearlight left a bloody mark on his face.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>BA he continued to run forward for dozens of meters before he dared to stop. He suddenly turned around and slashed, but it was all in vain.</p><p>Lu Ming was standing tens of meters behind him, looking at him with a smile.</p><p>“Hey, why are you slashing at the air?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>BA he’s face suddenly turned red, and his eyes burst out with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Your movement technique is not bad, but do you think you can defeat me with just one movement technique? In your dreams!”</p><p>BA he growled, the black Zhen Qi on his body became even thicker, faintly condensing into an evil ghost, and the killing intent was as cold as the glaciers of the North Pole.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
