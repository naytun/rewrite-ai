The general stars Hall is a place established by the royal family to specially gather all the geniuses in the world. It’s the place with the most geniuses in the blazing sun Empire, aside from the five great sects!</p><p>Ming Feng replied.</p><p>“There’s actually such a place?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Brother Tian, if you’ve come to the Imperial City to handle some matters, then you’ll be leaving very soon. That’s fine, but if you plan on staying permanently in the Imperial City, then I’d mind if you join the general Star Hall.”</p><p>the general stars Hall was built by the previous emperors of the blazing sun Empire. It has been used to this day. As long as you join the general stars Hall, the heavenly suppression King and the other elders will have no reason to interfere. At most, only the younger generation will be able to interfere.</p><p>Mingzhu introduced.</p><p>Mingzhu then explained what was going on with the general stars Hall.</p><p>It was very simple. It was the place where the royal family gathered all the heroes of the world and trained generals, so it was called the general Star Hall.</p><p>Many people who came out of the general Star Hall would become great generals.</p><p>Lu Ming was tempted.</p><p>Joining the general Star Hall might be a good choice.</p><p>By joining the general Star Hall, he would at least have a temporary place to stay. Moreover, the general Star Hall was considered a very important place in the imperial capital, so he might be able to obtain some important information.</p><p>“I wonder what are the conditions to join the general Star Hall?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s almost no requirement. There’s only one condition, and that’s talent!</p><p>as long as you have talent, the general stars Hall will take you in, no matter what your identity is, where you came from, what your cultivation is, whether you are the son of a King, a Minister, or a commoner.</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>“It’s so loose?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>big brother tianyun, let me tell you. There’s a saying that the burning sun royal family is not willing to be controlled by the ten direction Sword School and wants to cultivate their own power. That’s why they built the general stars Hall, and the conditions are so low.</p><p>Ming Feng whispered.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>It seemed that the relationship between the ten direction Sword School and the royal family was quite delicate.</p><p>brother Tian, the general Star Hall will open its doors to recruit a batch of people every month. The day after tomorrow is the day of the monthly recruitment. Brother Tian, you can go and give it a try!</p><p>Mingzhu said.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun, let me tell you something. My sister is also a member of the general Star Hall. As for me, I’m going to join the general Star Hall the day after tomorrow. We’ll be there together then.” Ming Feng shouted.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Then take care, brother Tian. We’ll meet the day after tomorrow!”</p><p>Mingzhu cupped her hands and left with Ming Feng.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to turn around. He turned a few streets before he found a restaurant and checked in.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>Two days passed by peacefully, and nothing happened.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>The general Star Hall was extremely famous in the imperial capital. He only needed to ask around to find out its exact location.</p><p>Lu Ming headed to the general stars Hall.</p><p>The general Star Hall was located in the northernmost part of the imperial capital. There were continuous mountains and numerous halls there, and one could not see the end of them with a glance.</p><p>The gate of the general Star Hall was very majestic. There were two bronze Qilin statues standing on both sides of the gate.</p><p>At the gate, there were more than a dozen burly men standing straight, exuding a strong and fierce aura.</p><p>Obviously, they were all experts, and they were all great Martial Master experts.</p><p>In front of the door, there was a table, and a white-haired old man was there to register.</p><p>People came and went at the main entrance. Many of them were senior students of the general Star Hall.</p><p>Those who joined the general Star Hall were all called students.</p><p>There were also some who, like Lu Ming, were newcomers who intended to join the general stars Hall.</p><p>“Big brother tianyun!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived when he heard a shout.</p><p>Ming Feng and Mingzhu walked over.</p><p>“Good Morning!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and greeted him.</p><p>“It seems that not many people have come!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and smiled.</p><p>the general stars Hall recruits a batch of people every month, so there aren’t many people. On average, there are about a hundred people every month.</p><p>Mingzhu explained.</p><p>“Show me your bloodline!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man came to the front of the old man and the old man said indifferently.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>With a flash of bloody light, a tall brown bear appeared with three blood-red chakras.</p><p>“Third level Blood Meridian, sure. What’s your name?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“Fang Wei!” The young man said.</p><p>Then, the old man took out a Jade token and wrote a few inscriptions on it. He handed the token to the young man and said, ” “Alright, this is your identity Jade card. You are now a student of the general Star Hall.”</p><p>The youth revealed a happy expression as he took the Jade token and walked into the general Star Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. isn’t this procedure too simple? ” he asked.</p><p>“It’s that simple!”</p><p>Mingzhu said with a smile.</p><p>“Then wouldn’t there be disciples from the five great sects in the general Star Hall?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>yes, of course there are disciples from the five major sects. There are quite a few of them. Some of them have come here to join the general Star Hall, some for cultivation, some for experience!</p><p>“However, after joining the general Star Hall, the general Star Hall will still have certain measures.”</p><p>Mingzhu explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>One by one, the young men went to register.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that as long as one’s Blood Meridian was above level two, they could join the general stars Hall.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice filled with killing intent was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around, the corners of his mouth could not help but reveal a cold smile.</p><p>It was Hua Jie.</p><p>At this moment, Hua Jie had changed into a long silver robe with a Jade belt around his waist. He was staring at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Beside him, a few young men followed him and walked over.</p><p>“Brat, you actually dare to stay in the imperial capital and even think of joining the general Star Hall? Just as well, don’t leave today.”</p><p>Hua Jie said gloomily.</p><p>“Haha, isn’t this the young prince? What a coincidence, eh? You’ve changed your pants, why do you still smell?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s nose twitched and he said with a smile.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Hua Jie’s face instantly turned red as he shouted with a ferocious look.</p><p>This was the greatest hatred in his heart.</p><p>Although he had warned others not to tell anyone about what had happened two days ago, there was no such thing as an impervious wall in the world. The news spread very quickly, and in two days, it had almost spread throughout the Imperial City, becoming the laughingstock of others.</p><p>Hua Jie hated Lu Ming to the core. Now, Lu Ming actually dared to mention this?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Someone couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“So he’s the young man from two days ago?”</p><p>he actually dared to treat Hua Jie like that. I guess Hua Jie must hate him to the core. This is going to be interesting.</p><p>“Beside Hua Jie is Chen Xiong. That kid is finished.”</p><p>On the side, some of the senior students of the general Star Hall started to whisper.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
