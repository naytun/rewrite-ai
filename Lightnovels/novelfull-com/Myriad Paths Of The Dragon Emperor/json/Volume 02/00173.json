Are you crazy? I didn’t do it on purpose.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly and used his midair step to Dodge with all his might.</p><p>I don’t care if it’s intentional or not. In any case, you’ve seen it. I’m going to dig your eyes out.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“F * ck, so what if I saw it? I was even seen by you? How should we settle this?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily.</p><p>“You … You … Shameless pervert, despicable, despicable scum …”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was red with anger as he cursed incoherently.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s palm was even more powerful, sealing Lu Ming from all directions. Even if Lu Ming used the midair step, it was difficult for him to Dodge.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming cast the ancient shield technique.</p><p>An ancient shield condensed and floated in front of him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s demonic palm continued to hit the ancient shield.</p><p>There was a series of violent explosions. The ancient shield in front of Lu Ming shook violently but it was not broken. It had completely blocked Xie nianqing’s demonic palm.</p><p>an earth rank martial skill, you’ve actually cultivated an earth rank martial skill? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Usually, only martial arts grandmasters were qualified to cultivate earth level martial arts techniques. Now, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated it with his second grade Grandmaster realm cultivation. It was no wonder that Xie nianqing was shocked.</p><p>“Haha, now you know how powerful I am? It’s already like this, why don’t you just follow me and follow me in the future? that, don’t fight anymore, I won’t lower myself to your level.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, very cocky.</p><p>“I’ll dig out your eyes from your big head.”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and launched a storm of attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>One had to admit that Xie nianqing was too powerful. In terms of combat strength, Lu Ming was definitely not his match.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had cultivated the ancient shield technique and all of Xie nianqing’s attacks were blocked by the ancient shield.</p><p>Xie nianqing struck dozens of times but did not manage to break Lu Ming’s defense. Instead, he was so tired that he was panting.</p><p>Xie nianqing, you’re the one who was unkind first. You monopolize such a good place and you still have the cheek to hit me. Don’t think I’m afraid of you.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>While defending, Lu Ming did not forget to attack. His long spear pierced through the air and continuously attacked Xie nianqing’s vital points, but they were all dispersed by Xie nianqing’s palm force.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves, and neither of them was able to defeat the other.</p><p>After the last exchange, both of them retreated a dozen steps and stood facing each other.</p><p>Xie nianqing was panting heavily. His face turned red at the thought of the scene just now. He glared at Lu Ming fiercely. If looks could kill, Lu Ming would have been pierced through like a hornet’s nest.</p><p>Lu Ming was also sweating and panting like a bull. He held a few spirit crystals in his hand and controlled his Blood Meridian to recover with all his might.</p><p>Although the power of an earth rank martial skill was great, the consumption of true Qi was also extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Hey, why are you staring at me so hard? Do you still want to see it?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but say.</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Lu Ming wished he could give himself a slap and secretly curse himself for having a cheap mouth.</p><p>As expected, Xie nianqing’s eyes widened even more. A sharp murderous intent emerged from his eyes. He gritted his teeth so hard that they made cracking sounds. He wished he could bite Lu Ming.</p><p>However, this time, Xie nianqing did not make a move. Instead, he glared at Lu Ming and said coldly, ” I’ll let it go this time. Now, please leave this place. I’ve already said it before, this place belongs to me.</p><p>“Belong to you? why? Can you finish using this underground river? I’m going to take a shower now.”</p><p>After a huge battle, Lu Ming felt itchy all over. He could not wait to jump into the underground river and take a bath.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>“No? I’m a man, and a man can’t say that he can’t do it. Even if he can’t, he has to do it today. Look, I’m undressing. If you like to look, you can look more.”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming began to undress.</p><p>He realized that he couldn’t use normal methods to deal with Xie nianqing. It was easier to deal with him by being a little more shameless.</p><p>As expected, Xie nianqing’s eyes burned with rage when he saw Lu Ming undressing. However, in the end, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and leave.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He took off all his clothes and jumped into the underground river.</p><p>The river water was extremely cold. Lu Ming felt every pore on his body open up and a wave of comfort spread throughout his body.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming soaked in the water leisurely.</p><p>“Eh, there are fish in the water?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt that there was something swimming around in the water.</p><p>Lu Ming dived into the water.</p><p>The underground river was quite deep, at least more than ten meters deep. When Lu Ming dived in, he saw many silver-white shrimp the size of a palm swimming around.</p><p>so it’s a shrimp. Wait, is this a hundred-year-old shrimp? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>The hundred-year shrimp was a strange species that could live for at least one hundred years. It was extremely rare, and it usually lived in some unpopulated places.</p><p>The most famous thing about the centenarian shrimp was that its meat was extremely delicious and contained a large amount of essence. If a warrior ate it, it could continuously improve his body and increase the strength of his body.</p><p>In the outside world, each of them could be sold for a sky-high price. However, Lu Ming could see a group of them at a glance.</p><p>no wonder, no wonder Xie nianqing didn’t want to leave. There are hundred-year prawns here. How cunning.</p><p>Lu Ming initially felt sorry for Xie nianqing, but now, he felt indignant.</p><p>“I’ll catch it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s claws reached out, and essential Qi gushed out, forming a net of essential Qi that enveloped the centenarian shrimp.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>There were at least twenty-odd century prawns caught by Lu Ming. He took out a Jade box, filled it with water, and placed the prawns into the jade box before storing it in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, he twisted his body and swam forward like a fish, catching a group of hundred-year prawns.</p><p>In less than half an hour, Lu Ming had caught hundreds of century prawns.</p><p>there are so many century prawns in this underground river. There should be more in other places. I’ll come back in a few days!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the water, satisfied. He put on his clothes.</p><p>When they walked out of the cave, they didn’t see Xie nianqing’s figure. He should be in another cave.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with them. He returned to the cave and sat on the stone bench. With a wave of his hand, a box of hundred-year prawns was placed on the stone table.</p><p>The centenarian shrimp was the size of a palm and was silvery-white in color. Lu Ming picked one up and shook it to death with his essential Qi. Then, he peeled off the shell.</p><p>It revealed the crystal clear and incomparably fat prawn meat.</p><p>Lu Ming took a bite. It was extremely fresh and tender in his mouth. There was no fishy taste. Instead, there was a faint fragrance.</p><p>It was indeed very delicious. Lu Ming finished a century shrimp in a few moves.</p><p>Soon after, he felt a cool energy spread throughout his body, seeping into his muscles and bones. A numbing itch spread out, and it was very comfortable.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming circulated the flaming Vajra Arts to refine this energy and increase the strength of his body.</p><p>the effects of the hundred-year prawns are indeed astonishing. It’s just as the rumors say!</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming felt that his physical body had improved. It was more effective than ten days of bitter cultivation.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
