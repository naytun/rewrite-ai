The chanting played a huge role in Lu Ming’s rapid rise to power.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not know how this chanting came about, he seemed to have gotten used to it. As long as he comprehended martial arts techniques, he would enter the Supreme shrine and comprehend the martial arts techniques through the chanting.</p><p>“When did it disappear?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Is it because I broke through to the great Martial Master realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Speaking of which, ever since Lu Ming had broken through to the martial Grandmaster realm, he had not entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>After the breakthrough, Lu Ming took on the mission to exterminate the Dongyi tribe. He hurried through the night and arrived at dongque city.</p><p>For the first few days after he arrived at dongque city, he stayed in the military camp. There were so many people, so Lu Ming naturally did not enter the Supreme shrine. After that, the Dongyi tribe attacked the city. Then, in order to pursue the Dongyi tribe, he came to this plane.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, Lu Ming did not enter the Supreme shrine even once.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, it was very likely because he had broken through to the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>“As expected, it still disappeared!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming shook his head and sighed.</p><p>He had already expected this outcome.</p><p>Since the sound of chanting had such a wonderful function and was constantly emitted without stopping, whether it was man-made or some kind of formation, it needed energy. And the energy would be exhausted eventually, and it would stop once it was exhausted.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that it would happen after he broke through to the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>“So what if there’s no such chanting? I, Lu Ming, can still rise up and comprehend martial arts techniques quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>Then, he stopped thinking and started to refine the blood essence.</p><p>This time, there were two first grade great martial masters, one second grade great Martial master’s blood essence, and two fourth grade great martial masters ‘blood essence. The blood Qi essence was extremely vast.</p><p>The huge amount of essence was converted into genuine Qi. In his dantian, the Qi cyclone spun rapidly, and the speed became faster and faster. His genuine Qi also became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming began to strive for the second grade great Martial Master.</p><p>Three hours later, a strong aura suddenly burst out from Lu Ming’s body. However, in the blink of an eye, the aura hid itself and Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>Second grade great master realm, breakthrough!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>After devouring the blood essence of four fourth grade great martial masters and a small number of second and first grade great martial masters, Lu Ming finally broke through to the second grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>The amount of energy required was truly terrifying.</p><p>However, the level of Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian did not increase. It was still at the fifth level.</p><p>It was getting harder and harder to increase the level of his bloodline.</p><p>However, as long as he could improve, no matter how difficult it was, Lu Ming was confident that he could keep on improving.</p><p>now that I’ve reached the second grade Grandmaster realm, I don’t have to fear the two fifth grade Grandmaster realm elders anymore. I can even kill them!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident smile.</p><p>“Let’s see what’s in their storage rings?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand moved and five storage rings appeared.</p><p>These were all Grandmaster realm storage rings. Lu Ming was quite looking forward to it.</p><p>First, it was the storage ring of a first grade great Martial Master.</p><p>The storage ring was very ordinary and could be considered the lowest grade of storage rings.</p><p>However, the items inside still made Lu Ming look surprised.</p><p>Spiritual crystals. There were thousands of spiritual crystals in the entire box.</p><p>Each spiritual crystal was milky white in color and exuded a dense spiritual Qi. The box was neatly arranged.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>Spiritual crystals could only be used by Warriors above the Grandmaster realm because they were filled with rich spiritual Qi.</p><p>And this kind of spiritual Qi, because it was gathered together, was extremely fierce and domineering. If a warrior below the martial Grandmaster realm used it to cultivate, it was very easy to explode and die.</p><p>Spiritual crystals were the currency used by martial grandmasters and above.</p><p>Spiritual crystals were mainly divided into four grades: lower spiritual crystal, middle spiritual crystal, upper spiritual crystal, and Supreme spiritual crystal.</p><p>A lower spiritual crystal was worth 10000 taels of silver.</p><p>The spiritual crystals of the first level Grandmaster realm warrior were all lower spiritual crystals. 1000 pieces were worth 10 million taels of silver.</p><p>This was a huge sum of money. Naturally, Lu Ming was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>the Dongyi tribe lives in the depths of the mountains by the sea. They must have found spiritual crystal mines. They are indeed rich.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He was looking forward to the remaining few storage rings.</p><p>If a first grade Grandmaster warrior had 1000 spiritual crystals, what about a second grade or even a fourth grade Grandmaster?</p><p>Other than the spiritual crystals, there were a few spiritual weapons in the storage ring. They were all second-level spiritual weapons and were not particularly valuable. After packing up, Lu Ming looked at the next storage ring.</p><p>The storage ring had been left behind by a first grade great master.</p><p>There was still a box of spiritual crystals in it. There were a total of 1200 pieces, more than the previous one. Lu Ming was even more pleased and continued to read.</p><p>The next one was left behind by a second grade Grandmaster. It did not disappoint Lu Ming.</p><p>Three thousand dollars, a whole three thousand dollars.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to tremble. He could not wait to look at the storage ring of the fourth grade great master.</p><p>This storage ring was several times larger than the previous storage rings, and there were several boxes inside.</p><p>Lu Ming opened it and his eyelids kept twitching.</p><p>Spiritual crystals. They were all spiritual crystals. They were arranged in neat rows.</p><p>Lu Ming started to count in a hurry.</p><p>There were more than 11000 pieces, all of them lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. Then, he was overjoyed.</p><p>The Dongyi people must have found a spiritual crystal mine deep in the coastal mountains. Otherwise, how could there be so many spiritual crystals?</p><p>Generally, a first, second, or even fourth grade great Martial Master realm warrior would not have so many spiritual crystals on him. This was because a great Martial master’s cultivation required spiritual crystals. If they had spiritual crystals, they would have used them up, so how could they have so many?</p><p>The four Dongyi tribe warriors had a total of more than 16200 spiritual crystals.</p><p>In terms of silver, it had already exceeded 160 million taels of silver.</p><p>What a huge fortune this was!</p><p>haha, if I exchange these spiritual crystals for contribution points, it’ll be enough for me to use for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but burst out laughing.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming looked at the storage ring of the young man from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming was very disappointed.</p><p>He was clearly a fourth grade great Martial Master, but in his storage ring, other than a few spiritual weapons and swords, some healing and cultivation pills, there were only a hundred spiritual crystals and three million taels of silver.</p><p>His wealth couldn’t even compare to that of a first grade great master realm warrior from the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Needless to say, the disciples of the mystical sword sect must have exchanged all their wealth for contribution points.</p><p>how many spiritual crystals will we get if we take all the storage rings from the Dongyi people? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining with hope.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was really tempted. He needed too many resources for his cultivation. He felt that he was lacking resources at all times.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
