It would be of great help to Lu Ming. One could only win every battle if one knew one’s enemy and oneself.</p><p>There were 60 names recorded in the book, which meant that there were 60 people on the bronze list.</p><p>Before Lu Ming entered the bronze rank, there were 56 people on the bronze rank. Yao Tianyu was killed. However, with Lu Ming and Feng xinglie, there were 57 people on the bronze rank, which meant that three more people had entered the bronze rank recently.</p><p>“As expected, the Vermillion Bird Hall has the least number of people.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall had 11 students, the Black Tortoise Hall had 12, the Azure Dragon Hall had 15, and The White Tiger Hall had 22.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall was last, while The White Tiger Hall was the strongest.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s gaze landed on the first ten names.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, Duanmu Yunyang, bu xingkai, and Duan gang …</p><p>The ten names represented the top ten of the bronze rank.</p><p>“The Vermillion Bird Hall only has one person in the top ten!” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall only had one person in the top ten, and she was ranked sixth.</p><p>Four from The White Tiger Hall, three from the Azure Dragon Hall, and two from the Onyx tortoise Hall.</p><p>There was no doubt that the Vermillion Bird Hall was the worst in terms of both the number of people and the top geniuses.</p><p>“Top ten?” A glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes, and he revealed a trace of fighting spirit.</p><p>Very quickly, two hours had passed and the sky was already bright.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out of the room, he saw pang Shi and Hua Chi already in the courtyard. Besides them, Feng Wu was also there.</p><p>Lu Ming, I heard that Hua Chi has been collecting information on the geniuses on the bronze rank. How’s it going? ”</p><p>Feng Wu asked.</p><p>“I’m done.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Yes, but I have to add a few points. Let’s talk as we walk!” Feng Wu said.</p><p>The few of them nodded and walked out.</p><p>the geniuses on the bronze list can be roughly divided into six levels and three types. Have you heard of them? ”</p><p>Feng Wu asked.</p><p>“Six levels, three types?”</p><p>Lu Ming, Hua Chi, and pang Shi were a little puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The six levels are divided according to combat strength. After all, most of the geniuses on the bronze list are at the peak of the ninth grade master realm. Although some of them are ranked first, their combat strength is very close.</p><p>the 45th to 60th ranks are in the sixth level. The 30th to 45th ranks are in the fifth level. The 20th to 30th ranks are in the fourth level. The 10th to 20th ranks are in the third level. The 4th to 10th ranks are in the second level. The top three are the strongest and are in the first level.</p><p>there are three types. The first type is like you and Feng xinglie. They just entered the school and entered the bronze rank not long ago. They are very talented, but they are not very strong because they have only been on the school for a short time!</p><p>the second type is the extremely talented geniuses who have been on the bronze list for a long time, but have deliberately stayed at the peak of the ninth grade master realm in order to build a stronger Foundation. This type of geniuses have the most terrifying combat strength, and most of the top ten on the bronze list are this type.</p><p>the third type is the senior disciples who have been in the sect for many years. They are stuck at the peak of the ninth grade master realm and have been unable to break through. These types have limited potential, but due to their many years of cultivation, they have mastered all sorts of martial arts and secret techniques, so their combat strength is also very strong.</p><p>Feng Wu explained in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two nodded after hearing that. They did not expect that there were so many tricks to it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, in the future, you just need to know what to do when you face your enemies.”</p><p>Feng Wu said.</p><p>The four of them chatted as they walked. Soon, they arrived at the place where the great competition of the four courtyards would be held.</p><p>The great competition of the four courtyards was not held in the four courtyards or in the middle of the four courtyards. Instead, it was to the North of the Onyx tortoise Hall, where the core of the mystical sword sect was.</p><p>This place was vast, with peaks towering and clouds lingering, making it hazy.</p><p>This was where the sect leader, golden-robed elders, and gold-rank disciples cultivated and lived. It was said that other than these, the true strength of the mystical sword sect was hidden here, and it was the core of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>In front of the peaks, there was a flat piece of land where a fighting stage was built. Around the fighting stage were wide stands.</p><p>The layout was very similar to the bronze platform, but it was several times wider and more majestic.</p><p>The square grandstand could hold more than 100000 people.</p><p>The disciples from the four halls continued to gather there. When Lu Ming and the others arrived, they found the Vermillion Bird Hall’s area and sat down.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard.</p><p>“That’s the headmaster of The White Tiger Hall and the silver-robed elder of The White Tiger Hall,”</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others looked up and saw dozens of figures stepping on the air. There were old men and middle-aged men. Each of them had the aura of a mountain. They were extremely dense and suffocating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of people landed in The White Tiger Hall’s area.</p><p>“The Vermillion Bird Hall’s headmaster and the silver-robed elder are here as well.”</p><p>Suddenly, a Vermillion Bird Hall disciple nearby cried out in excitement.</p><p>There were also dozens of people in the air, both men and women, and all of them had powerful auras.</p><p>The leader was an old man with white hair. He was wearing a fiery red robe with a lifelike Vermillion Bird embroidered on it. He had a kind expression and greeted the people from the Vermillion Bird Hall with a smile.</p><p>This was the head of the Vermillion Bird Hall, Yan LAN.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a familiar face beside the Vermillion Bird Hall’s Dean. It was Mu Lan.</p><p>“Fengwu, what’s mu Lanhe’s relationship with the Dean?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but ask Feng Wu.</p><p>“You don’t know? The director is big sister Mu Lan’s grandfather.”</p><p>Feng Wu said.</p><p>“Grandpa? As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but recall that Yao Tianyu had mentioned this news a few months ago. He just did not pay attention to it at that time.</p><p>As expected, Mu Lan’s identity was not simple.</p><p>On the side, pang Shi and Hua Chi were also dumbfounded.</p><p>A Dean of a large courtyard was definitely a top figure in the mystical sword sect. His status was comparable to the Golden-robed elders, and his authority was even greater than the Golden-robed elders.</p><p>In the mystical sword sect, he was a true Overlord.</p><p>At that moment, the Vermillion Bird Hall Director and the others landed in the Vermillion Bird Hall’s area. After they landed, the Vermillion Bird Hall Director and Mu Lan actually walked toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Mas … The Dean is here.” Pang Shi was so nervous that he stuttered.</p><p>Hua Chi was rather calm, but there was a hint of anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>The people nearby were even more nervous. After all, it was not easy to see the Dean.</p><p>“Who is the principal here to see? Could it be Lu Ming?”</p><p>Such a thought flashed through many people’s minds.</p><p>They had guessed correctly. The Vermillion Bird Hall Dean and Mu Lan walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets the Dean and Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
