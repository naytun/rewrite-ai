The debris exploded into pieces and flew in the air.</p><p>However, the two old men did not stop and continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in the middle and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two elders ‘sabers slashed at Lu Ming’s spear and a shocking fluctuation erupted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. His body trembled and he staggered backward.</p><p>“He’s not going to make it, kill him!”</p><p>The two elders were overjoyed when they saw that Lu Ming had been forced back. They attacked Lu Ming with even more vigor.</p><p>The remaining five Dongyi tribesmen also charged at Lu Ming with furious roars.</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was surrounded by enemies from all directions. He seemed to be completely outmatched and was at a complete disadvantage. He kept retreating.</p><p>Soon, they retreated to a corner near the exit.</p><p>kill him! All the scrolls here will be ours! The Dongyi tribe will rise again!</p><p>A fourth grade great Martial Master elder shouted excitedly.</p><p>The other Dongyi people were excited as well.</p><p>At this moment, a sharp piercing sound suddenly came from the door beam above his head. A sword light was rapidly piercing toward Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>The sword light was fast, accurate, vicious, and extremely powerful.</p><p>His master was a fourth grade great Martial Master and a genius from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>That’s right, the person who had launched the sneak attack was one of the two fourth grade great Martial Master realm experts from The White Tiger Hall. It was unknown when he had hidden himself on the door beam.</p><p>“Go to hell, Lu Ming. Don’t blame me. You can only blame yourself for offending the Duanmu family. As long as I kill you, the Duanmu family will definitely put me in an even more important position.”</p><p>A cold and vicious glint flashed in the eyes of the young expert from The White Tiger Hall. It was as if he could already see Lu Ming dying in his hands.</p><p>The Duanmu family had absolute power in The White Tiger Hall. Most of the disciples who joined The White Tiger Hall had chosen to join the Duanmu family. Only by joining the Duanmu family could they obtain better cultivation resources.</p><p>Of course, Ling Kong, that kind of freak, had a strong backing.</p><p>However, at this moment, he suddenly saw a smile at the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth. That smile was as if he had succeeded in his scheme.</p><p>as expected, they’ve made their move. Just as well, we’ll settle this together!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>He had not used his full power in the battle with the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Otherwise, with his cultivation at the peak of the first grade great Martial Master realm, he would not have been forced into such a difficult situation by two fourth grade great martial masters and five third and second grade great martial masters.</p><p>Everything that had happened just now was an act.</p><p>In fact, the young man from The White Tiger Hall had followed the Dongyi tribe in. Lu Ming had noticed him as soon as he had entered.</p><p>However, he didn’t say anything because he could feel the killing intent from the young man.</p><p>Therefore, he pretended to be at a disadvantage and even sent himself to the opponent to lure him out.</p><p>Sure enough, the young man from The White Tiger Hall had fallen into his trap. Thinking that he had seen a good opportunity, he attacked decisively, wanting to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, all of this was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian erupted, and his aura rose sharply.</p><p>At the same time, the true Qi in his body burst out.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at the young man from The White Tiger Hall. He held the end of the spear and swept it out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear swept across the blades of the Dongyi people with a terrifying power. The Dongyi people were all shocked. They groaned and quickly retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s spear did not stop. It continued to sweep toward the young man from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The young man from The White Tiger Hall narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He had pounced on Lu Ming with all his might just now. It was too late for him to retreat now. He could only grit his teeth and unleash his full power. The long sword in his hand burst forth with a powerful sword aura and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear was as easy as breaking a dead branch. It destroyed his opponent’s sword Qi. At the same time, the long spear bent into an arc and landed heavily on the body of the young man from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The sound of bones cracking could be heard as the young man from The White Tiger Hall let out a blood-curdling shriek. His body was sent flying, and he coughed up large mouthfuls of blood in the air.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stomped heavily on the ground, his body spinning rapidly as he flew backward. The long spear in his hand also spun rapidly as he stabbed at the young man from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, don’t!”</p><p>The young man from The White Tiger Hall was shocked as he screamed in the air.</p><p>However, the spear did not stop.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear pierced through The White Tiger Hall’s young man’s heart, and he was lifted into the air.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, you are so ruthless …”</p><p>The young man from The White Tiger Hall glared at him with hatred.</p><p>“If you didn’t want to kill me, I wouldn’t have killed you with one shot! This is called asking for it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>If the other party had not been bent on killing him, he would not have been killed by Lu Ming in two moves.</p><p>After all, the other party was a rather talented genius from The White Tiger Hall. His combat strength was not weak.</p><p>The young man from The White Tiger Hall revealed an expression of unwillingness, and his life force gradually faded.</p><p>not good! He was hiding his strength just now! Retreat!</p><p>The Dongyi people were terrified. An old man shouted.</p><p>He had clearly seen that the person who had launched the sneak attack was definitely a fourth grade great Martial Master. However, he was killed by Lu Ming in an instant. Lu Ming’s strength was too terrifying.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now.”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his blood and devoured the blood essence of the young man from The White Tiger Hall. Then, in a flash, he charged toward the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>“You guys go quickly, I’ll block him!”</p><p>An elder from the eastern Barbarian tribe bellowed and turned around to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast his strongest move without hesitation.</p><p>At this moment, his bloodline was at the stage of exploding. The power of this move was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>The Dongyi old man didn’t even have time to scream before half of his body was blown up.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, the aura on Lu Ming’s body dropped rapidly.</p><p>The time for the bloodline explosion was up.</p><p>The rest of the eastern wasteland people were even more terrified and ran for their lives.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and did not give chase.</p><p>The time for the bloodline explosion had already passed, and their combat strength had weakened. Even if they chased after them, they wouldn’t be able to kill them all. It was better to forget it.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately devoured all the blood essence of the eastern barbarians who had died in battle. Not only that, but he also obtained five storage rings.</p><p>As a martial Grandmaster, it was normal for him to have a storage ring.</p><p>It could be said that a storage ring was the standard of a martial Grandmaster. If a martial Grandmaster didn’t even have a storage ring, he would be too miserable.</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming moved and left the hall. After a few breaths, he appeared in a small room in the hall.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and prepared to refine the blood essence.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed at that moment.</p><p>He realized that the chanting had disappeared.</p><p>In the depths of the Supreme shrine, there was a strange chanting sound. Under this chanting sound, Lu Ming’s mind was particularly clear. He comprehended martial arts techniques and made rapid progress.</p><p>But now, it had disappeared.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
