The three people behind them looked especially serious.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and once again collided with the iron rod in the air.</p><p>The strong Qi spread out and stirred up gusts of strong wind. Some of the disciples at the front of the stands with slightly weaker cultivation were directly swept up by the strong wind. If it were not for the help of the disciples with higher cultivation, they would have been blown away.</p><p>It was too terrifying. This attack had already surpassed the realm of martial masters and reached the realm of great martial masters.</p><p>After a loud noise, the two figures separated at the same time and slid back more than ten meters.</p><p>this power is really strong. Let’s continue!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he continued to rush forward.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>He roared in the air and pounced at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them collided again.</p><p>The two of them separated after one strike and then clashed again.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>On the fighting stage, it was as if two ancient gods were bombarding each other. The terrifying collision sounds were deafening, and those with lower cultivation had to use their martial arts to resist.</p><p>“It’s too terrifying. Is this the strength of two new generation Kings? Only the top five of the bronze rank can have such combat strength, right?”</p><p>that’s right. Those who are ranked fifth on the bronze list are definitely not this powerful. The most terrifying one is still Lu Ming. He just joined this year.</p><p>it’s really shocking. I wonder if Lu Ming can break senior brother Feng Wuji’s record. Back then, senior brother Feng Wuji managed to get to the fifth place as a newbie in his first year.</p><p>“Just wait and see!”</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards were shocked by Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The explosions continued, and after exchanging hundreds of moves, the two of them separated and stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve lost!”</p><p>Ling Kong sighed.</p><p>Suddenly, his body trembled and he fell to the ground, panting heavily.</p><p>Whether it was the Mad beast technique or the bloodline explosion, they couldn’t be maintained for too long. At this moment, the time was up.</p><p>As Ling Kong admitted defeat, the crowd boiled over, especially the Vermillion Bird Hall disciples who were shouting Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>Lu Ming’s victory basically meant that he had entered the top ten.</p><p>This time, the Vermillion Bird Hall might have two people in the top ten, which was already very good. They would definitely not be at the bottom.</p><p>In the past seven to eight years, the Vermillion Bird Hall had always been at the bottom.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if there’s a chance in the future, let’s fight again!”</p><p>Ling Kong said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Hahaha!” Ling Kong laughed as he walked down the fighting ring and went back to his normal self. He might have another match next.</p><p>Lu Ming came down from the fighting ring. After that, another match continued.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the competition to end.</p><p>After the competition ended, it was the elders ‘turn to have a headache.</p><p>This time, the elders were going to choose two of the strongest to make up for the top ten.</p><p>Then, from the remaining six people, three people would be chosen as challengers to challenge the top ten experts. If they could win, they would replace them.</p><p>After an intense discussion, the candidate was finally chosen.</p><p>Without a doubt, Ling Kong’s combat strength was obvious to all. He was directly placed in the top ten as one of the first two places.</p><p>Then, the other three began to issue challenges.</p><p>Similarly, no one had challenged Lu Ming.</p><p>When the challenge ended, this year’s top 10 was finally born.</p><p>This year’s top 10 was not much different from the previous bronze list.</p><p>The previous top ten on the bronze list were:</p><p>First place, Zhang Muyun, Azure Dragon Hall.</p><p>In second place was Duanmu Yunyang from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Third place: bu xingkai from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Fourth place, Duan gang, Onyx tortoise Hall.</p><p>Fifth place: Duanmu Chen, White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Sixth place: Cheng Feicheng, Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Seventh place, Zhuo yirong, Azure Dragon Hall.</p><p>Eighth place, Su Song, Black Tortoise region.</p><p>Ninth place, Dong CE, Azure Dragon Court.</p><p>Tenth place: Lei Dong, White Tiger Hall.</p><p>Among them, there were four from The White Tiger Hall. Three of them were in the top five, and they were extremely powerful.</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall had three, the Onyx tortoise Hall had two, and the Vermillion Bird Hall had one.</p><p>This time, there was a slight change.</p><p>Ling Kong and Lu Ming had made it into the top ten. Su Song, who was originally in eighth place, and Lei Dong, who was in tenth place, were not destined to be in the top ten.</p><p>In this way, The White Tiger Hall still had four people, the Azure Dragon Hall had three, the Onyx tortoise Hall had the worst, with only Duan gang, and the Vermillion Bird Hall had two.</p><p>The top 10 would have to fight against each other. In other words, each of them would have to compete with the other nine. In the end, they would be ranked according to the number of victories they won.</p><p>Today’s competition had come to an end. The battles between the top ten would be held tomorrow.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s already very good that you can achieve this result. Don’t feel pressured in tomorrow’s competition. Just perform as you normally would.”</p><p>Mu Lan said. However, she was smiling so much that her eyes were almost squinting.</p><p>“That won’t do. I’m going to get first place. I’m still waiting for your reward, Senior Sister Mu Lan.”</p><p>Lu Ming said half-jokingly.</p><p>“Alright, then you have to work hard!”</p><p>Mu Lan’s face was slightly red. She cast a glance at Lu Ming, immediately causing Hua Chi, pang Shi, and the rest to stare at him.</p><p>Then, Mu Lan left the place with light steps.</p><p>Lu Ming, pang Shi, and Hua Chi also walked back together.</p><p>After returning to the dormitory, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and started cultivating the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>Today’s battle with Ling Kong could be said to be extremely satisfying.</p><p>Other than the last move of the fire gun technique, the explosion of his bloodline, and the fire Force, he had already used all his strength.</p><p>He had 100% of his cultivation, a second-grade lower tier body, and the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>Lu Ming had benefited a lot from this battle. He felt that the fire gun art was not far from a breakthrough.</p><p>In the midst of the wonderful chanting, Lu Ming was quietly comprehending the firearms Control art.</p><p>The fire-patterned spear in his hand started to dance unconsciously. The strong wind whistled and the long spear broke through the air.</p><p>Time passed by unknowingly.</p><p>Three hours had passed when Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>“I’ve finally reached the fifth level of the fire gun art, the perfection level.”</p><p>There was a flash in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The fire gun technique had been stuck at the peak of the fourth level for a long time. Finally, after the battle with Ling Kong, he had a breakthrough.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun, Duanmu Yunyang, how strong are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique to cultivate.</p><p>At this moment, The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster was seated in a resplendent Hall. Below him were Duanmu Yunyang, bu xingkai, and Duanmu Chen.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Lu Ming to have reached such a terrifying level. You must be careful when you meet him tomorrow.”</p><p>The headmaster of The White Tiger Hall warned.</p><p>don’t worry, Dean. Lu Ming is no match for me. I’ll definitely teach him an unforgettable lesson tomorrow. I’ll let him know who’s the one with the bronze first spear!</p><p>Bu xingkai said confidently.</p><p>“Although Lu Ming is quite powerful, he’s not a threat to me at all. My goal is to defeat Zhang Muyun and take the first place.”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang said with bright eyes.</p><p>alright, Yunyang. If you can defeat Zhang Muyun this time, the family will definitely reward you handsomely.</p><p>The White Tiger Academy President said.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
