At that time, I had already shown mercy. However, you thought that you were superior and that I must obey you. When I returned to the sect, you ordered someone to summon me and asked me to hand over the dark blood Stone.”</p><p>I didn’t agree to it, but you instigated the star Moon Tower to cause trouble for the new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples and hurt my brother pang Shi on purpose. Your purpose was to infuriate me so that you could take me down with the people of the law enforcement Hall. Then, I would be at your mercy.</p><p>“At that time, you were so arrogant and insufferably arrogant that I didn’t even have the right to challenge you. But now? Where did your arrogance and arrogance go?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked as he spoke. When he finished speaking, he had already walked to Yao Tianyu’s side. His eyes were indifferent as he looked down at him.</p><p>The surrounding disciples of the four halls suddenly came to a realization after hearing this.</p><p>So that was how the feud between Lu Ming and Yao Tianyu came about.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu is too arrogant. He actually used such a despicable method.”</p><p>“It’s not that Yao Tianyu is arrogant, but that’s how the world of martial arts should be. It’s just that Yao Tianyu chose the wrong person. If he had chosen someone else, he would have to submit to him. However, he had to meet Lu Ming, a peerless genius. Therefore, he can only fail.”</p><p>The disciples of the four halls were discussing among themselves.</p><p>“The battle of life and death ends here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>“Wait a minute, Lu Ming, wait a minute. Don’t kill me. You’re a peerless genius, and I’m not bad either. We can work together. In the future, no one in the mystical sword sect will be our match.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s body struggled madly as he shouted.</p><p>He was still young and had a bright future ahead of him. He didn’t want to die.</p><p>“Cooperation?”</p><p>“You are not qualified to work with me!” Lu Ming smiled in disdain.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the spear flashed and pierced through Yao Tianyu’s chest.</p><p>Yao Tianyu let out a blood-curdling screech as he clutched the spear shaft tightly with both hands. Blood was gushing out of his mouth, and his eyes were filled with unwillingness, hatred, and regret.</p><p>At this moment, he finally regretted. He regretted offending Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out the long spear and shook it. The blood on the long spear flew away, not leaving a single drop.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s body slowly went limp, and finally, he stopped breathing.</p><p>Yao Tianyu, a genius on the bronze list, was dead!</p><p>At this moment, the crowd was boiling.</p><p>Today, not only had Lu Ming made it onto the bronze ranking, but he had also killed Yao Tianyu. All of this was like a dream. It was so unreal.</p><p>But that was the truth.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming’s name was destined to spread throughout the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>In the southern stands, pang Shi laughed maniacally. Mu Lan and the others also smiled.</p><p>On the east side of the stands, Yao Tianyu’s lackeys were pale and weak as they sat in their seats.</p><p>Yao Tianyu was dead. They knew that their future days would not be easy.</p><p>Previously, they had been tyrannical because of Yao Tianyu, and had offended many people. Those people were afraid of Yao Tianyu, so of course, they did not dare to do anything to them.</p><p>But now that Yao Tianyu was dead, who would care about them? their future would be miserable.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list were also shocked by the scene.</p><p>“I can’t match up to Lu Ming’s talent!”</p><p>Feng xinglie let out a long sigh and turned around to leave the stands.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the winner of this battle. Lu Ming, do you still want to continue the challenge?”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced loudly.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>Killing Yao Tianyu was enough. There was no need to fight anymore.</p><p>It was better to keep some trump cards for himself.</p><p>In this battle, he had already exposed his body refinement Dao and profound level martial arts techniques.</p><p>Of course, he could only display the power of the second level of a profound rank martial skill.</p><p>Additionally, he still had control force which he had not used.</p><p>If he really used it, the disciples of the four courtyards would be shocked beyond words.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’re really amazing.”</p><p>Pang Shi, Hua Chi, Mu Lan, and the others also got down from the stands and walked toward Lu Ming. Before they even arrived, pang Shi had already started shouting excitedly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when did you manage to cultivate a black level martial arts technique? We’ve suffered so much hiding it from you.”</p><p>Feng Wu said as she walked over.</p><p>“It’s too noisy here. Let’s talk as we walk.” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of people here, and it was really inconvenient to talk in such a noisy place.</p><p>The crowd left the bronze platform and headed toward the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained his trip to the Southridge fire field to cultivate his spear technique.</p><p>As for the fact that he had comprehended control force, he didn’t mention it.</p><p>you’re saying that he’s only been cultivating in the Southridge fire field for a few months, and he’s already cultivated the profound rank spear technique to this level? ”</p><p>Feng Wu and the others all stared at him.</p><p>that’s right. The environment of that place just so happens to be compatible with my spear technique. As such, it’s much easier for me to cultivate there.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … What a pervert!”</p><p>Everyone despised Lu Ming.</p><p>How could it be so easy to cultivate a profound grade martial skill? it was very easy to find a suitable environment to cultivate in, but how many people could actually master it?</p><p>Everyone could only describe Lu Ming as abnormal.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Only he knew that he had relied on the chanting in the Supreme shrine and his tireless cultivation to achieve his current achievements.</p><p>They chatted as they walked, and soon, they arrived at the Vermillion Bird Hall where Lu Ming and pang Shi were staying.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, I still haven’t returned the 3000 contribution points I owe you from last time.”</p><p>After entering the courtyard, Lu Ming took out his identity Jade card.</p><p>Mu Lan’s beautiful eyes flickered. Her limpid eyes darted back and forth on Lu Ming’s body. After a while, she said, last time, not only did you defeat Ning Feng, but you’ve also made it onto the bronze list and killed Yao Tianyu. You’ve greatly boosted the prestige of the Vermillion Bird Hall. I can’t be stingy anymore. Take the 3000 contribution points as your reward!</p><p>“Many thanks, Senior Sister Mu Lan.”</p><p>As soon as Mu Lan finished her sentence, Lu Ming immediately thanked her without any embarrassment, as if he was afraid that Mu Lan would go back on her words.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mu Lan was speechless. Then, she shifted her gaze and said, now that you’ve made it onto the bronze ranking, you’ll be representing the Vermillion Bird Hall in the great competition of the four halls in two months.</p><p>“The great competition of the four courtyards?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>Pang Shi was confused as well, while Hua Chi and Feng Wu’s eyes flickered, as if they had heard about the competition.</p><p>Mu Lan explained, ” the great competition of the four courtyards is a competition between the four courtyards. It’s held once a year. For example, among the bronze disciples, the geniuses on the bronze ranking will directly participate. It’s because it’s meaningless for other disciples to participate.</p><p>similarly, the silver disciples will be directly participated by the geniuses on the silver ranking. In the end, they will be rewarded according to the results of the disciples of each courtyard.</p><p>not only will the individual participants be rewarded handsomely, but the sect master will also represent the sect and give more resources to the great courtyard that performs well. This is the most important thing.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
