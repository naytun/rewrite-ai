Their momentum was so strong that it covered the sky and the earth, as if it could crush everything.</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect were either cultivating or fighting alone. When had they ever seen such a scene? Now that he saw it, he was extremely frightened.</p><p>They’d been arrogant and hadn’t thought much of the Dongyi people, thinking that they’d only come to fight for contribution points. Now, they no longer had that thought.</p><p>A Great War, this was a true Great War. To be able to survive such a Great War was already not bad.</p><p>Some people felt their legs go soft and had already retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who had comprehended force.</p><p>Using the power of fire to fight against the power of thousands of troops and horses, Lu Ming was able to calm down and not be too shaken.</p><p>“Get ready!”</p><p>An armored general on the city wall shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The soldiers on the city wall moved in unison. They drew their longbows and pulled their bowstrings fully. Their eyes were fixed on the demonic beast Army that was rolling in.</p><p>Most of these soldiers were martial artists of the warrior realm. Their cultivation might not be as high as the mystical sword sect’s disciples, but they were used to great battles, so their mental fortitude was much stronger than the mystical sword sect’s disciples.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The shaking was getting more and more intense. The Army of tens of thousands of demonic beasts was slowly approaching.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>When they were within a certain range, the general in the iron armor ordered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>On the city walls, the tens of thousands of soldiers roared. Their roars shook the heavens, and their momentum was not the slightest bit weaker.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Soon after, the arrows were shot out. A black mass of arrows shot towards the demonic beast Army like a dark cloud.</p><p>Suddenly, the demonic beasts in the Army were shot by the arrows and fell to the ground. However, it was only a small portion of the demonic beasts. Many more demonic beasts continued to charge forward without fear of death.</p><p>“Continue to shoot!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Another wave of arrows was shot at the demonic beasts.</p><p>The roars shook the sky and blood Qi filled the air. It was extremely tragic.</p><p>Some of the mystical sword sect disciples broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>In such a scene, the arrows were like rain. No matter how strong one’s cultivation was or how strong one’s protective genuine Qi was, they would still be pierced through by the continuous arrows.</p><p>Aiya, my stomach hurts a little. I need to relieve myself.</p><p>A mystical sword sect disciple suddenly clutched his stomach and cried out. Then, he turned around and ran.</p><p>“Argh! My stomach hurts a little too, what a coincidence.”</p><p>When the others saw this, they also fled.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of them had left.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He was scared off just like that. Such a person would have limited achievements in the future.</p><p>young warriors, we don’t need you to do anything now. You should focus on the Dongyi Warriors and high-level demonic beasts.</p><p>An old man in iron armor walked over and said.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized him. He was the governor of dongque city, Fu Liang.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. The city walls of East que city were tall and majestic. Most of the demonic beasts below were level one demonic beasts. It would not be easy for level one demonic beasts to attack.</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s disciples were needed to deal with the LV 2 and even Lv 3 demonic beasts.</p><p>That was because there were not many martial grandmasters in the Army of dongque city. They were all generals.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Dongyi tribe began to fight back. They shot tiny arrows at the beasts.</p><p>“Defend!”</p><p>With a loud roar, shields were raised on the city wall.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>All the arrows shot by the Dongyi people hit the shields. Only a few of them hit the soldiers of dongque city.</p><p>“Return fire!”</p><p>On the city wall, another round of arrows was fired.</p><p>After a few rounds, the demonic beasts were already close to the city wall.</p><p>kill! Charge! Break into the East lacking city and take all the valuables and women!</p><p>A long howl came from the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Dongyi people roared and controlled their beasts to rush up the city wall.</p><p>On the city wall, rolling wood and burning fire tubes poured down in torrents.</p><p>Screams of pain rang out continuously.</p><p>It was a brutal and murderous battle. It was completely different from a one-on-one battle between martial artists. Many mystical sword sect disciples felt their mouths go dry.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why the mystical sword sect had allowed the disciples of the four courtyards to take on this mission. It was to temper themselves.</p><p>Only through such a bloody battle could one’s will reach a higher level.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Finally, a demon beast reached the city wall. The Dongyi people on the demon beast shot out arrows.</p><p>Most of the Dongyi people were topless and strong. They had a longbow and a scimitar on their waists.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Fu Liang roared and pulled out his battle blade. He was the first to slash at a Dongyi man.</p><p>The blade light sliced through the air and cut the Dongyi man and his beast in half.</p><p>Fu Liang’s cultivation was at least at the third grade of the great Martial Master realm, and he was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other disciples of the mystical sword sect roared and followed suit.</p><p>Instantly, sword Qi, saber radiance, and fist force glowed on the city wall.</p><p>“Big rock, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. With a move of his hand, the fire Tung spear appeared. He thrust the long spear forward and nailed a demonic beast to the city wall.</p><p>The cultivation of the mystical sword sect disciples was undisputable. As soon as they attacked, a group of demonic beasts and Dongyi people who rushed up the city walls were killed in an instant.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>Then, the horn sounded, and the endless demon beasts retreated toward the mountain range by the sea like a tide.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>They retreated just like that? Just the beginning?</p><p>haha! The Dongyi tribe is nothing more than this!</p><p>The disciples of the mystical sword sect were emboldened and laughed heartily.</p><p>Fu Liang frowned and pondered for a while before saying, something’s not right. How could the Dongyi retreat as soon as they attacked? it doesn’t make sense.</p><p>“City Lord Fu, perhaps the Dongyi tribe has seen too many of our Masters and is afraid.”</p><p>One of the mystical sword sect disciples said with a smile. Fu Liang frowned and did not say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought. He had a vague feeling that things were not that simple.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe left as quickly as they came. Soon, they were gone.</p><p>The next step was to clean up the battlefield. Lu Ming pretended to help, but his real goal was the blood essence of the demonic beasts and the Dongyi experts.</p><p>However, the blood essence of low-level demonic beasts and martial artists was of little help to Lu Ming. Lu Ming specifically chose high-level demonic beasts and martial artists, but there were very few of them. There was not a single martial Grandmaster.</p><p>He had devoured dozens of demonic beasts and blood essences of sixth grade master realm and above. Unfortunately, it did not help Lu Ming much.</p><p>After the battle ended, Lu Ming and the group went back to rest.</p><p>A day later, the war drums sounded again.</p><p>They hurried to the city wall. The Dongyi tribe had attacked again.</p><p>But this time, it was similar to the last time. The Dongyi tribe had just started their attack, but they had retreated again.</p><p>The third day was the same.</p><p>At that moment, many people felt that something was wrong.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe’s actions seemed to be to disturb the enemy instead of an official attack.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
