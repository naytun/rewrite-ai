Does he really want to fight for first place?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s face had been completely replaced by a smile.</p><p>Pang Shi and Hua Chi were so excited that they were trembling and speechless.</p><p>Then, the competition continued.</p><p>After the fifth round was the sixth round.</p><p>In the sixth round, Lu Ming was up against Ling Kong.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ling Kong had already fought yesterday. Therefore, there was no need for them to fight again. Ling Kong simply admitted defeat.</p><p>In the six rounds of competition, only three people had maintained a winning streak.</p><p>They were Zhang Muyun, Duanmu Yunyang, and Lu Ming.</p><p>By this time, the situation was slowly becoming clear.</p><p>Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang were in first and second place. Lu Ming was in third place. Bu xingkai should be in fourth place.</p><p>As for the fifth and sixth place, it should be between Ling Kong and Duan gang.</p><p>In the latter part of the sentence, Dong CE was almost in the 10th place. There was no suspense, and the difference should not be big.</p><p>There were only three rounds left.</p><p>Everyone’s focus was on Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang. They wanted to know who would be the champion.</p><p>Of course, there was still Lu Ming. Would Lu Ming be able to fight against the first two? How many moves could he block?</p><p>Everyone’s attention was on these points.</p><p>Under everyone’s anticipation, the seventh round began.</p><p>The first match of the seventh round, Ling Tian versus Duan gang.</p><p>This battle could be said to be the longest and most intense battle in the competition.</p><p>Both of them were violent and bombarding the fighting ring like two demons fighting.</p><p>After a few hundred moves, Duan gang was the one who won in the end because the duration of the art of aerial beast frenzy had passed.</p><p>The second match was Lu Ming against Zhuo yirong.</p><p>Zhuo yirong simply admitted defeat.</p><p>The third match finally ushered in the most important match, and also the match that everyone was most concerned about.</p><p>Zhang Muyun versus Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>The pinnacle battle between the two of them had started ahead of schedule, meeting in the seventh round.</p><p>Two figures, one from the East and one from the West, walked up to the fighting ring.</p><p>In an instant, the entire place boiled over.</p><p>One was the best swordsman, and the other was the best saber user. The battle between the first and second place on the bronze ranking list could stir up the blood of the young martial artists. Many people were speechless and stared at the two people in the fighting ring with wide eyes.</p><p>Zhang Muyun, I lost to you a year ago. That was a disgrace to me. Now, I will take back the glory that belongs to me and step on you.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s gaze was like a tiger’s and was extremely overbearing.</p><p>Even when facing Zhang Muyun, he was still arrogant and overbearing. This was his natural personality. He could be considered a tyrant.</p><p>However, Zhang Muyun was more like a king. He had the posture of a Dragon and a Tiger, and his eyes were like stars. He always had a gentle smile on his face.”Duanmu Yunyang, you lost to me last year. You don’t stand a chance this year, and you won’t stand a chance in the future. The gap between us will only grow further and further.”</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s voice was calm and gentle, but it was filled with unparalleled confidence.</p><p>If an ordinary person dared to say this, everyone would think that he was arrogant, arrogant, and looked down on everyone.</p><p>However, when Zhang Muyun said this, no one felt that he was arrogant or condescending. Instead, they felt that he was speaking the truth.</p><p>Because he had the right to say so.</p><p>“I told you to take back your words. Take this!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura erupted from Duanmu Yunyang’s body. He didn’t move, but a several-meter-long battle blade completely condensed from true Qi appeared above his head. It cut through the air and charged toward Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a sword cry, a giant sword formed above Zhang Muyun’s head and slashed forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber and the sword met, stirring up countless sword Qi and saber radiance that shot out in all directions.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>The blade Qi and sword Qi hit the ground. If it were not for the inscriptions on the ground, it would have been full of holes.</p><p>It was just a test, but it had already reached such a terrifying stage.</p><p>“Destruction blade art, spirit destruction!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s battle blade was unsheathed. It was as if a demon had broken through its restraints and reappeared in the world. The terrifying blade light seemed to be able to split the void as it slashed toward Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. Zhang Muyun’s body did not move, but his long sword was unsheathed.</p><p>As soon as the sword was unsheathed, a sharp and merciless will filled the air, and the entire world seemed to be enveloped by his sword Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A light sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. If one did not listen carefully, one would not be able to hear it. A sword light flashed and shot out before the sound could be heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This sword Qi wasn’t as overbearing as Duanmu Yunyang’s blade light. However, it was able to destroy Duanmu Yunyang’s blade light with a single strike.</p><p>“Obliteration blade art, exterminate the heavens!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang shouted.</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang’s entire body sank into a deathly silence as the blade was unleashed. He no longer had any feelings.</p><p>Humans were heartless, but the saber was even more heartless. There was only an endless sharpness that could kill everything in the world.</p><p>“Four Seasons sword technique, overflowing with spring, break!”</p><p>Zhang Muyun made a faint sound and thrust his sword forward. In an instant, hundreds of sword Qi appeared in the sky. The sword Qi was fine and dense, like spring rain, and enveloped Duanmu Yunyang’s blade technique.</p><p>If Duanmu Yunyang’s blade technique represented destruction, then Zhang Muyun’s sword technique represented vitality and hope.</p><p>The streaks of sword Qi were like drops of spring rain. Although each drop was not powerful, when they were combined, their power was endless.</p><p>The saber radiance and sword Qi dissipated in the air.</p><p>wonderful, this is simply too wonderful. Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang’s Black grade low level martial arts techniques have already been cultivated to the highest level, man and martial arts as one.</p><p>he’s definitely at the realm of man and martial arts merging, far surpassing the others. Moreover, their physical bodies are both complete rank-2. It’s really amazing.</p><p>both of their bloodlines are at level six. Their combat strength has completely exceeded the Martial Master realm. Killing an ordinary first grade great Martial Master won’t be a problem.</p><p>“Are they the top two geniuses on the bronze list? It’s indeed shocking.” Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and he sighed in his heart.</p><p>Beside him, Mu Lan glanced at Lu Ming and said,”How is it? This is the strength of Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang. Do you still have the confidence to obtain first place after seeing their battle strength?”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Lu Ming said, revealing a meaningful smile.</p><p>“This guy? You’re pretending to be profound, right?”</p><p>Mu Lan felt that she could not understand Lu Ming. She did not know if he was telling the truth.</p><p>“Obliteration blade art, world destruction!”</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang bellowed and instantly slashed out eighteen times.</p><p>Each of the eighteen blade lights was extremely terrifying. The key was that the trajectory of each slash was erratic, like a wild horse out of control, jumping and unpredictable.</p><p>“Four Seasons sword technique, scorching summer.”</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and a sword light appeared in the sky. It gave off a dazzling light, like a sun.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>This sun was actually continuously shooting out dense sword Qi. No matter how unpredictable Duanmu Yunyang’s blade lights were, they all crumbled under the sword Qi.</p><p>“The autumn wind is bleak!”</p><p>Then, Zhang Muyun’s next move was unleashed.</p><p>The fighting ring seemed to have fallen into a state of desolation. Everything was dead and the autumn wind was blowing.</p><p>A lonely sword-light flashed across the sky and slashed toward Duanmu Yunyang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu Yunyang was forced to retreat rapidly.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
