In two months, you’ll be representing the Vermillion Bird Hall in the tournament. You’ll have to work hard on your cultivation during this time. If you rank well, not only will you receive a generous reward, but the entire Vermillion Bird Hall will also benefit.</p><p>Mu Lan said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. don’t worry. I’ll do my best!</p><p>“Fengwu, what did you say a few months ago?” he asked. I said that if I defeat Yao Tianyu in four months, you’ll have to treat me to a big meal.”</p><p>“Hey! Why do you remember it so clearly? big sister Mu Lan has already given you three thousand contribution points as a reward, and you’re still thinking about my feast?”</p><p>Feng Wu rolled her eyes at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. that’s another matter. I’ve been thinking about your big meal for a few months.</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right, that’s not the same thing. Haha, you guys have to bring me, old pang, along.”</p><p>Pang Shi jeered from the side.</p><p>“Hey, big rock, what are you doing?”</p><p>Feng Wu said unhappily.</p><p>In the end, they couldn’t win against the few of them. The group left the Vermilion Bird Peak and arrived at xuanjian city.</p><p>Everyone ate and drank to their heart’s content. When they returned, it was already late at night.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cultivate that night. Instead, he had a good rest.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming walked towards the contribution Hall.</p><p>He was going to exchange his silver and a few martial arts techniques for contribution points, and then exchange them for some demonic beast blood essence to cultivate.</p><p>He had more than four million taels of silver on him, as well as three martial skill manuals.</p><p>They were respectively the yellow grade low rank sword technique ” wild wave slash “, the yellow grade high rank body technique ” soaring cloud steps “, and the yellow grade high rank cultivation technique ” Hunyuan technique “.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not plan to exchange for the cloud treading steps. He planned to keep it for his own cultivation.</p><p>After all, his cultivation time was too short. He could not be compared to those senior disciples who had cultivated for a few years, or even five or six years, or even seven or eight years. Those senior disciples had no lack of movement martial skills, offensive martial skills, and defensive martial skills. Their maturity was not weak.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only cultivated four types of martial arts techniques.</p><p>Flame Dragon Fist, Dragon Snake steps, lustrous sword technique, fire lance technique.</p><p>At his current realm, the flame Dragon Fist and Dragon serpent steps were no longer of much use. He had to cultivate a higher level martial art technique.</p><p>He planned to focus on practicing the ” cloud treading steps ” and ” fire controlling gun art ” before the great competition of the four courtyards. As for other martial arts techniques, he didn’t have that much energy.</p><p>And this was because of the chanting in the Supreme shrine. How long had he been cultivating? It had only been ten months or so. If it had been anyone else, they would definitely not have been able to cultivate these martial skills to such a profound level in such a short time.</p><p>After arriving at the contribution Hall, Lu Ming exchanged wild wave slash and Hunyuan technique for contribution points. He had exchanged for a total of thirty thousand contribution points.</p><p>He also exchanged two million taels of silver for contribution points, leaving him with more than two million taels of silver.</p><p>He had a total of 50000 contribution points. In addition to the remaining contribution points that Lu Ming had, he had a total of 55000 contribution points.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming started to exchange for demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>A ninth grade second level demonic beast cost 1600 contribution points each. Lu Ming exchanged for 25 of them, using up a total of 40000 contribution points.</p><p>Lu Ming also exchanged for a piece of upper Lv 2 soft armor, which cost him three thousand contribution points.</p><p>His 55,000 contribution points had been reduced to 12000 in an instant.</p><p>This rate of expenditure was truly too terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but feel his heart ache. However, it was worth it to improve his abilities.</p><p>After returning to the dormitory, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and began to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming did not consume the demonic beast’s blood essence continuously. Instead, he would consume and refine a portion every two days. This way, his Foundation would not be unstable.</p><p>For the rest of the time, Lu Ming spent most of his time on the ‘cloud treading steps’ and the ‘fire controlling gun technique’. He would also take some time to comprehend the’ force ‘of fire.</p><p>Every time he comprehended the force of fire, a volcano would appear in his mind.</p><p>The might of a volcano would spread in his heart.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, as his understanding of the force of fire deepened, the effect of cultivating the fire gun controlling art was better than usual. It was as if he was cultivating in the Lingnan fire field at all times.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and the annual great competition of the four courtyards was getting closer and closer.</p><p>During this period of time, the atmosphere in the four halls of the mystical sword sect became more and more tense. All the geniuses on the bronze list were cultivating in seclusion in order to improve themselves.</p><p>More people were stepping up to challenge the bronze platform, hoping to make it to the bronze rank and be qualified to participate in the great competition of the four courtyards.</p><p>More than a month later, the fire gun art had another breakthrough and entered the fourth level.</p><p>When the great competition of the four courtyards was about to begin, the fire gun controlling art had reached the peak of the fourth level. However, it seemed that he had encountered a bottleneck. No matter how hard Lu Ming cultivated, he could not break through.</p><p>His greatest improvement was the soaring cloud steps.</p><p>As a warrior’s martial Dao realm rose, his understanding of martial Dao would also become deeper and deeper. It would be faster for him to practice low-level martial arts techniques.</p><p>For example, if a martial King level martial artist were to practice yellow rank martial arts, he would probably be able to reach the sixth level in less than two days.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s current cultivation of the yellow level upper level soaring cloud was several times faster than when he cultivated the lustrous sword technique.</p><p>Within two months, Lu Ming had cultivated the cloud treading steps to the highest level, the sixth level, the Union of man and martial arts.</p><p>After refining twenty-five portions of ninth grade second level demonic beast blood essence, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had also risen to the peak of the eighth grade master realm. He was only one step away from the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>At this time, the mystical sword sect was welcoming the most lively and exciting moment of the year.</p><p>The great competition of the four courtyards.</p><p>At this moment, almost all the mystical sword sect disciples had returned to the sect.</p><p>Although most of the disciples were not qualified to participate, it would be very helpful for their cultivation to witness the battle between the top geniuses of different realms.</p><p>Moreover, there were actually four new disciples on the same stage in this great competition of the four courtyards. This was extremely rare even in the history of the mystical sword sect, so it was naturally even more attractive.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is for you.”</p><p>On the day of the Grand competition of the four courtyards, Hua Chi and pang Shi knocked on Lu Ming’s door before dawn. Hua Chi stuffed a small notebook into his hands.</p><p>“What is this?” Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>this is the information of all the geniuses on the bronze list. You can take a look. It might be helpful to you.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“What? The information of all the geniuses on the bronze list? How did you guys get it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, Hua Chi has spent a lot of money recently and hired many senior disciples to help collect these. I’ve realized now that the love-struck fool has nothing but money.”</p><p>Pang Shi said.</p><p>“Hey, big rock, what are you saying? What do you mean I have nothing but money? I’m telling you, I have everything.”</p><p>Hua Chi said unhappily.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart moved. He could not help but feel touched.</p><p>It was not hard to imagine that to collect such information, it was definitely not something that could be done with a little bit of money. It was definitely a huge number.</p><p>He had a feeling that Hua Chi’s identity wasn’t simple.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“I just don’t want you to lose so badly. After all, we’re from the same dormitory. If you lose so badly, I’ll lose face too.”</p><p>Hua Chi left these words before turning around and leaving.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, we’ll set off together later.”</p><p>Pang Shi said as he touched his head before leaving.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
