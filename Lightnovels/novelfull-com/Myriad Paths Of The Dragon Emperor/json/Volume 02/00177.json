His aura exploded as he swept his spear at the Duanmu family members.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One after another, sabers were unsheathed. The Duanmu family’s burly men roared in anger and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Dozens of people attacked together.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear swept past and the saber Light collapsed. Five to six burly men were swept away by Lu Ming like cannonballs. They crashed into the walls of the courtyard and slid down like mud, not breathing at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily and swept his spear again, killing another seven to eight burly men.</p><p>These were all martial artists at the master realm. They were far inferior to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Attack! Great Martial Master, attack!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong was furious.</p><p>On the stairs, more than a dozen Grandmaster realm martial artists dashed out and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>The weakest of the dozen or so great martial masters was at the first grade great Martial Master realm, and the strongest was at the fifth grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>More than a dozen people joined forces, and their power was astonishing.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming burst out with all his strength without holding back.</p><p>Bloodline, power of fire, all of them were unleashed, and his combat strength was fully unleashed.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had made great progress. Before he came out, he had finally achieved small success in the force of fire.</p><p>The force of fire was at the initial success stage and its power was extremely terrifying. It made Lu Ming look like he was filled with scorching heat, as if he was a volcano with raging flames.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the attacks. He swept his long spear with the force of a landslide.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The result was the same as before. Lu Ming crushed them like rotten wood. Four to five Grandmaster realm powerhouses were sent flying. Their bones were broken and their internal organs were shattered. They died before they even landed on the ground.</p><p>Strong, unbelievably strong.</p><p>Lu yunxiong and the others gasped in shock and anger.</p><p>Li Ping and the three core elders were shocked and overjoyed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was like the tide, his aura was like a rainbow, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He swept his spear again and killed a few more great master realm experts.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in his hand and was like an undefeatable God of War. He killed his way through as if no one was there.</p><p>The Duanmu family members were shocked and couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>“This kid can’t be left alive. He’s too terrifying.”</p><p>Ning Kong, Lu yunxiong, and the others roared in their hearts. They were extremely shocked.</p><p>Every time he saw Lu Ming, he would realize that Lu Ming’s abilities would increase by a huge margin as if it would never stop.</p><p>“I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Ning Kong bellowed and pounced at Lu Ming like an eagle.</p><p>In the air, he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Ning Kong, a ninth grade great Martial Master, struck out with an earth-shattering palm.</p><p>The space rumbled and the air exploded. A terrifying pressure surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ancient shield!”</p><p>An ancient shield appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming unleashed his most powerful move, blasting it at ning Kong’s palm force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying blast of air rolled in all directions and Lu Ming’s attack was crushed. The powerful palm force continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>Li Ping turned pale with fright.</p><p>At this moment, Li Ping was being led by three core elders and retreated to a corner of the courtyard.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The powerful palm force slammed into the shield in front of Lu Ming, causing a violent explosion.</p><p>The ancient shield trembled continuously and then exploded with a loud bang. Lu Ming’s body was thrown backward more than twenty meters and he crashed heavily into a wall before he stopped.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“A ninth grade great Martial Master is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Just now, he had already resisted with all his strength. First, he used the move of explosion to cut off a part of the palm Power of the other party, and then he used the ancient shield spell to block it. Even with his complete second-grade physical body, he was still injured by the palm.</p><p>my bloodline is indeed useless against an existence five levels higher than me.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>Just now, the time for his bloodline to burst out hadn’t ended yet. He could have devoured half of the attack, but it had failed.</p><p>Ning Kong’s cultivation was seven levels higher than his. The difference was too great.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He did not know that ning Kong and the others were even more shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had managed to block ning Kong’s palm. Although he was injured, he was not killed. This was unbelievable.</p><p>Especially ning Kong himself, who was even more shocked.</p><p>One should know that he was a ninth grade great Martial Master. Although he did not use his full strength, he was confident that even an eighth grade great Martial Master would be injured by his palm. What cultivation level was Lu Ming at?</p><p>Second grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“An earth rank martial skill, you actually cultivated an earth rank martial skill?”</p><p>The old man from the Duanmu family who had been sitting on the wooden armchair shouted madly.</p><p>“What? An earth rank martial skill?”</p><p>The others were even more shocked.</p><p>Earth rank martial arts skills were extremely rare, and the difficulty of practicing them was even more shocking. Weren’t they usually only practiced by martial arts grandmasters?</p><p>Lu Ming was only a second grade great Martial Master and he had successfully cultivated it?</p><p>“Kill, we must kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu yunxiong, ning Kong, and the elder from the Duanmu family were all screaming in their hearts. They were afraid. Lu Ming’s talent was too terrifying. If he was allowed to grow, only God knew what he would become.</p><p>That would be their disaster. Only by killing them in the cradle could they avoid this disaster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on ning Kong’s body grew.</p><p>The old man from the Duanmu family also released his aura.</p><p>He was at the peak of the ninth grade great Martial Master realm, and he was even stronger than ning Kong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going to die today!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong roared.</p><p>“Oh, really? You’re the one who will die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was very indifferent.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, hurry up and leave. You’re not their match yet. As long as you leave, they won’t dare to do anything to me!”</p><p>Li Ping shouted, extremely worried.</p><p>The few of them were too powerful. Lu Ming was obviously not their match.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. I’ll kill whoever hurts you, even if he’s at the end of the world!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>At this moment, his hand glowed, and the blazing Tung spear disappeared. In its place was the demon subduing spear.</p><p>“Beast soul, beast soul, I didn’t expect to use it so soon.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>That’s right, he planned to merge with the beast soul and fight with ning Kong and the others.</p><p>The demon subduing spear had two and a half beast souls.</p><p>Two of them were at the peak of martial ancestor realm, and were known as half-step King warrior beast souls.</p><p>The other half was a King-level beast soul.</p><p>Lu Ming intended to fuse the beast soul of a peak martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>However, there was a huge risk involved. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation and physical strength, he was not confident that he could withstand the backlash.</p><p>However, this was the only way.</p><p>“Beast soul, come out!”</p><p>The demon subduing spear shook and a beast’s roar was heard. A giant black Wolf flew into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body exploded with an extremely powerful aura. This aura was powerful, evil, brutal, and filled with bloodlust.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but roar. His voice did not sound like that of a human but like that of a Wolf.</p><p>not good! He is fusing with a beast soul. It is a powerful beast soul. Stop him!</p><p>The elder from the Duanmu family roared in shock and anger.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
