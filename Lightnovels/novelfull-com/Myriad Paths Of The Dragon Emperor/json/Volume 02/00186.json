The terrifying devouring force spread all over his body to prevent himself from exploding from the beast soul’s power.</p><p>However, after a series of battles, Lu Ming’s body was still severely injured.</p><p>The rumbling continued, and the sun and moon shone in the sky. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the two young men in the sky.</p><p>The two headmasters of The White Tiger Hall and the Vermillion Bird Hall were in a standoff, and neither of them could interfere.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, there was a continuous stream of light, and silver-robed elders appeared in the air.</p><p>At first, it was the silver-robed elders from The White Tiger Hall. Soon after, the silver-robed elders from the Vermillion Bird Hall, Azure Dragon Hall, and even the Onyx tortoise Hall appeared in the sky.</p><p>There were more than twenty silver-robed elders from the four great academies.</p><p>BOOM! At this moment, the sun and moon in the sky suddenly collapsed, turning into energy and dissipating in the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two of them roared at the same time, and their killing intent surged like a tide as they pounced toward each other.</p><p>The blade energy and the spear radiance swept across the sky, breaking through the air and killing.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight in the air, and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>Below, Lu Yao looked up at the sky in a daze, her eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming, the trash who used to be weak and sickly and could not cultivate, had actually grown to this stage?</p><p>She found it hard to accept and could not accept it.</p><p>“It’s just borrowing external power. He can’t be compared to brother Lin at all. Brother Lin is a hundred times, a thousand times stronger than him.”</p><p>Lu Yao kept warning herself in her heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, Mu Lan, Feng Wu, pang Shi, and the others had all rushed over. Soon after, even more people arrived after receiving the news.</p><p>For example, Zhang Muyun, Duan gang, and the others.</p><p>After he rushed over, he stood at the side and looked at the sky in shock.</p><p>In the air, Lu Ming and Duanmu Lin had exchanged more than a hundred moves, but it was still difficult to determine the victor.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and kill that little b * stard Lu Ming. He has killed dozens of experts from the Duanmu family!”</p><p>A silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family roared.</p><p>“Who would dare?”</p><p>Yan LAN shouted as his sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>The other silver-robed elders of the Vermillion Bird Hall also released their auras and rushed forward.</p><p>Yan LAN, Lu Ming has killed an elder of his sect. He has committed a heinous crime. How dare you protect him!</p><p>Duanmu pojun shouted.</p><p>the cause of the matter has not been clarified. I believe that Lu Ming would not do such a thing casually. There must be a reason.</p><p>Yan LAN did not give in.</p><p>“I don’t care what his reasons are. It’s a fact that Lu Ming killed his fellow disciples and killed the Duanmu family. That’s enough. He must die today!”</p><p>Duanmu pojun’s voice was extremely cold.</p><p>“Then why don’t you try?” Yan LAN coldly shouted.</p><p>The two sides were in a stalemate. It looked like an intense battle was about to break out.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, a calm voice rang out from the depths of the mystical sword sect. It was not angry, but it exuded an air of authority.</p><p>“Sect leader!”</p><p>Yan LAN, Duanmu pojun and the silver-robed elders ‘expressions changed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Four rays of light cut through the void and instantly appeared in the sky above the square. Four figures appeared.</p><p>The leader of the group was Lin Xueyi, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Behind him, there were three elders in golden robes.</p><p>The moment the sect leader of the mystical sword sect appeared, he frowned. With a wave of his hand, a gentle force was produced and gushed toward Lu Ming and Duanmu Lin, who were still fighting.</p><p>The two’s attacks disappeared, and their bodies seemed to be pushed back by something.</p><p>“Sect leader, please don’t stop me. Let me kill this bastard!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared madly. His body was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“You’re an overconfident piece of trash. Do you think I’ll be afraid of you? It’s still not certain who will kill who. Do you really think you’re a genius? in my eyes, you’re just trash.”</p><p>Lu Ming retorted coldly.</p><p>“Bastard, smash it! I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The sect leader of the mystical sword sect bellowed softly once again. It did not sound heavy, but it reverberated in Lu Ming and Duanmu Lin’s ears like thunder.</p><p>Their expressions changed and they didn’t speak.</p><p>“Sect leader, you’ve come at the right time. Lu Ming, that bastard, first killed dozens of people from the Duanmu family, then he boldly charged into the White Tiger Hall and killed a dozen of our Grandmaster realm experts in front of everyone. He even killed the chief elder!”</p><p>“Such a disgraceful and insane person must die. I beg sect leader to let me kill him with my own hands.”</p><p>Duanmu pojun bowed to the sect leader.</p><p>“Duanmu pojun, don’t try to make false accusations here. I’ve said it before, let’s figure out the reason first.”</p><p>Yan LAN cupped his fists as well before he turned to Lu Ming, ” “Lu Ming, what do you think is going on? Didn’t you kill dozens of people from the Duanmu family?”</p><p>When Yan LAN said ‘before’, he was obviously referring to the time before they arrived at The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming admitted it directly.</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the entire place was in an uproar. Duanmu pojun was overjoyed, while Yan LAN was shocked.</p><p>Mu Lan and the others looked anxious.</p><p>“Sect master, look, Lu Ming has admitted it himself,” Duanmu pojun said.</p><p>“I admit it, but aren’t you going to ask me where I killed them?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I don’t care where you did it. It’s a fact that you’ve killed my Duanmu family’s people!”</p><p>“Hehe!” Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered with Duanmu pojun and said, it’s my family. The Lu family and the Duanmu family were led by Lu yunxiong to kill my family members. They even tried to kill my mother. Do these people deserve to be killed? ”</p><p>Lu Ming did not speak to the Duanmu family. Instead, he spoke to the other people from the four campuses and the sect master.</p><p>“What? There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and turned to look at Duanmu pojun.</p><p>“Damn it, Duanmu pojun, your Duanmu family really has a lot of power. You actually dared to harm the family of your own disciples without permission. You’re worse than beasts. If it were me, I would kill you too!”</p><p>Yan Lan’s hair and beard stood on end as he glared at Duanmu pojun.</p><p>“Nonsense! Lu Ming, you’re talking nonsense. You’re slandering the Duanmu family. You deserve to die!”</p><p>Duanmu pojun shouted in anger.</p><p>“Slander? Your Duanmu disciple’s corpse is still lying in my Lu family. Do you want to go and take a look?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Duanmu pojun’s expression was somewhat unsightly as he said, ” even if there is such a thing, it is possible that they have heard the rumors and been bewitched. You should have returned to the sect to report the situation first and the sect would naturally investigate. However, you acted on your own and killed them. Your intentions are despicable.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming burst out laughing and said, ” Duanmu pojun, what you mean is that you want me to ignore the life and death of my family first and let your Duanmu family kill my Lu family’s people and my mother while I come back to report first and then make a decision. Has your head been kicked by a donkey? or is your IQ just that low? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s disdainful voice was like a storm that spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped. Lu Ming actually dared to scold Duanmu pojun?</p><p>Say that Duanmu pojun’s head was kicked by a donkey?</p><p>Isn’t he too bold?</p><p>“Little bastard, what did you say?”</p><p>Duanmu pojun was so angry that his entire body was trembling, and his old face was red.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
