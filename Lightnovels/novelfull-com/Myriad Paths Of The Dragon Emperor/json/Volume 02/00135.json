Your master is doing this for your own good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said seriously.</p><p>“I understand, young master. It’s just that I can’t be by your side to take care of you now.” Qiu Yue stuck out her tongue.</p><p>then you’ll have to work hard on your cultivation. When you reach the fourth grade great Martial Master realm or above, young master will take you to roam the world.</p><p>Lu Ming encouraged.</p><p>“Really? Young master, you’re not allowed to lie.”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>of course it’s true. When has young master ever lied to you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Time passed as the two of them chatted. Soon, more than an hour had passed.</p><p>“Young master, I’m leaving. Master should be looking for me.”</p><p>Qiu Yue said reluctantly.</p><p>go. With your talent, we’ll be able to roam the world together very soon.</p><p>Lu Ming pinched Qiu Yue’s face and smiled.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s big eyes were glistening with tears. She suddenly stood on her tiptoes and kissed Lu Ming on the cheek. Then, she turned and ran away with a flushed face. Like a Frightened Rabbit, she ran very quickly and disappeared into the forest in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Sensing the faint moisture and fragrance on his face, Lu Ming smiled and whispered, ” “This girl, I haven’t seen her for a while and she’s become a lot braver.”</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, he turned around and left.</p><p>In the following days, he continued to cultivate and hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>His martial arts and cultivation were both improving steadily.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>This month’s harvest was gratifying.</p><p>The fire gun spell finally made a breakthrough and reached the sixth level, the realm of man and martial arts as one.</p><p>However, he had only cultivated the soaring steps to the peak of the second level. He had yet to break through to the third level.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth grade master realm. The next step would be the Grandmaster realm.</p><p>“I should go back.”</p><p>Lu Ming had been in the coastal mountain range for more than two months.</p><p>The path of cultivation was one of tension and relaxation. One could not just cultivate blindly. Bitter cultivation might not necessarily have good results.</p><p>Lu Ming made his way to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the dormitory after half a day.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’re finally back. I thought you wouldn’t be able to make it in time.”</p><p>Pang Shi said anxiously as soon as he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Can’t make it? What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun and Zhuo yirong’s engagement party!”</p><p>Hua Chi walked out of the room with an invitation in his hand.</p><p>“Zhang Muyun and Zhuo yirong are engaged?” Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>seven days ago, Zhang Muyun personally came to send you an invitation. Unfortunately, you weren’t here, so he left this invitation with me.</p><p>Hua Chi passed the invitation to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the invitation card to take a look. The date was today and the address was the sword dance courtyard in xuanjian city.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard of the sword dance courtyard. It was very famous in xuanjian city for its elegant environment. Many famous people would choose to hold their happy events in the sword dance courtyard.</p><p>then I’m just in time. It’s just right to go now!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The sun had not set yet, so it was not too late to rush over.</p><p>Lu Ming had a good impression of Zhang Muyun. He was a good friend. He was engaged to Zhuo yirong and had personally come to give him an invitation. Naturally, Lu Ming had to go.</p><p>“Do you guys want to go together?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Forget it, the people going this time are all experts. We won’t join in the fun.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Hua Chi was a proud person and did not say anything more. He bade farewell and headed for xuanjian city.</p><p>……</p><p>Xuanjian city’s sword dance courtyard was unusually lively.</p><p>The red lights were lit up, and it was a festive scene.</p><p>Zhang Muyun was extremely talented. Before Lu Ming’s rise, he was ranked first on the bronze ranking. Even Duanmu Yunyang, the newcomer King, was suppressed by him.</p><p>Furthermore, he was an easy-going and benevolent person with the air of a King. He was very popular in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>This time, more than 50 out of the 60 people on the bronze rank had come to attend his engagement with Zhuo yirong.</p><p>Not only that, but there were also some silver disciples, elders, deacons, and even a few silver-robed elders.</p><p>Including Zhang Muyun and Zhuo yirong’s family, there were a few hundred people in the sword dance courtyard.</p><p>There was a small lake in the sword-dance courtyard, and there was a flat piece of empty land. In the empty land, dozens of tables were set up for the banquet.</p><p>At this time, although the banquet had not started yet, everyone was basically present.</p><p>The people who were familiar with each other sat at a table and chatted with each other.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man who looked like a guard stumbled in. There was blood at the corner of his mouth and one side of his face was swollen.</p><p>“Zhang Ji, what’s going on?”</p><p>Zhang Muyun’s father stood up and asked coldly.</p><p>This scene naturally fell into the eyes of the others, and they all looked over in surprise.</p><p>old master, young master, there are people outside the door who have come uninvited. We only asked and they attacked us. They have already barged in. We can’t stop them.</p><p>The guard shouted.</p><p>“What invitation? Do we still need an invitation to go to the place we want to go?”</p><p>A cold and arrogant voice sounded. Three young men walked over.</p><p>“Who are you people? Don’t you know that today is the day of senior brother Zhang’s engagement? You actually dare to force your way in?”</p><p>A disciple of the Azure Dragon Hall stood up and shouted.</p><p>His name was Wu kui, and he was ranked 43rd on the bronze rank.</p><p>“Yo, yo, yo, what’s the big deal about the engagement of a disciple on the Bullsh * t bronze list? What’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>A young man with a battle blade in his arms sneered.</p><p>arrogant! Let’s see what you have!</p><p>Wu kui shouted in anger. His body moved like an eagle as he pounced towards the young man and clawed at him.</p><p>“You dare to show off your skills in front of an expert with such a small skill!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man sneered and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber-hugging young man’s palm was clearly just his palm, but everyone seemed to see a peerless saber unsheathed from its sheath. The saber’s radiance soared into the sky and a bright saber radiance slashed at Wu kui’s claw.</p><p>In the next moment, Wu Hui let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew backward. He smashed two tables in a row before he could stabilize himself. However, his body kept trembling, and one of his palms was covered in blood.</p><p>The crowd was shocked and looked at the young man with the saber in shock.</p><p>To be able to injure Wu kui with just a casual slash of his palm, this level of combat strength was definitely not ordinary.</p><p>Wu kui was ranked 43rd on the bronze list, and only the top 20 geniuses on the bronze list could defeat him with one move. However, these people were very unfamiliar. They were not disciples of the four great academies.</p><p>Where did this genius come from?</p><p>Zhang Muyun stood up and cupped his fists,”Who are you?” I don’t think I’ve ever offended you.”</p><p>hehe, you’re Zhang Muyun, who’s ranked second on the bronze list, right? ”</p><p>One of the young men with a cold expression said.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize this cold-looking young man as Jian wuchen from the Qilin Hall.</p><p>The other two were Qilin Hall disciples.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
