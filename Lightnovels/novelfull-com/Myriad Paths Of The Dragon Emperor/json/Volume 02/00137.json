Xu Xuan is only ranked 42nd! Don’t think that you’re invincible! I’ll fight you!</p><p>A young man walked out.</p><p>PU sichong is about to make his move. He was ranked 19th on the bronze ranking, but he has dropped one rank and is now ranked 20th. He is much stronger than Xu Xuan.</p><p>Someone recognized the person who spoke.</p><p>PU sichong had fought with Ling Kong in the great competition of the four courtyards, and he was very powerful. Everyone was looking forward to PU sichong teaching the strong young man a lesson.</p><p>“What’s your ranking on the bronze list?”</p><p>The well-built young man asked with a smile.</p><p>“Not high, only 20th. There are still 19 people stronger than me.”</p><p>PU si said.</p><p>“20th place?”</p><p>“You’re no match for me. Let’s see who’s stronger.” The well-built youth shook his head.</p><p>“You’ll know how arrogant you are after the battle.”</p><p>PU sichong strode forward and arrived in front of the strong young man.</p><p>Junior Brother, these trash won’t shed tears until they see their coffins. Let’s end this quickly and let them know how much of a piece of trash they are.</p><p>Jian wuchen said coldly.</p><p>haha, don’t worry, senior brother Jian.</p><p>The well-built young man grinned and then shouted, ” “Brat, take this!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The well-built young man also threw a punch. His fist was black and shiny, emitting a metallic luster.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>PU sichong unsheathed his long sword, and the sword Qi soared into the sky. The green sword Qi almost turned into a solid, avoiding the fist of the strong youth and slashing toward him.</p><p>“You want to avoid my fist? dream on.”</p><p>The well-built young man sneered. He waved his fist, and it seemed to pass through space, instantly landing on PU sichong’s sword.</p><p>A loud sound rang out, and just like when he had fought with Xu Xuan, sharp black lights shot out from his fist towards PU si.</p><p>PU sichong’s expression changed. He moved his body and used the power of his opponent to retreat. He waved his long sword and slashed out a dozen sword lights, blocking the black light.</p><p>“You can block one of my moves. Not bad. But what about next?”</p><p>The strong young man laughed and rushed toward PU sichong. He punched out with both of his fists, and a terrifying fist force enveloped PU sichong, making a series of booming sounds.</p><p>PU sichong operated his sword technique and slashed out sword lights to block the attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them exchanged more than ten moves. Then, a figure flew out and coughed up blood in the air.</p><p>It was PU sichong, he had lost again.</p><p>Even if he tried his best, he could only last a dozen moves.</p><p>The hearts of everyone present sank. Was this still a disciple who had just entered this year?</p><p>Wasn’t he too strong? Everyone could see that the strong young man’s Black level low rank fist technique had reached the fourth level and was not far from the fifth level.</p><p>His body was also very strong, at least second-grade.</p><p>Most importantly, the other party’s bloodline had not even erupted yet, and he was already so strong.</p><p>It was too abnormal. If he participated in the great competition of the four courtyards, he would definitely cause a sensation.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Did they have to send out Masters from the top ten of the bronze rank to deal with a new disciple this year?</p><p>The crowd couldn’t help but look at the top ten of the bronze rank.</p><p>This time, eight of them were in the top ten of the bronze rank.</p><p>Other than Duanmu Yunyang and Lu Ming, everyone else had arrived.</p><p>Bu xingkai, Duan gang, Ling Kong, Duanmu Chen, Cheng feichen, and the others all had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>It would be embarrassing even if he won against a disciple who had just entered the sect this year. Moreover, Jian wuchen and the saber-hugging youth had not made their moves yet.</p><p>It was obvious that the young man didn’t want to give up. He wouldn’t leave until the winner was determined. If something went wrong, all the people on the bronze list would lose their face.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, a burly young man walked out.</p><p>it’s Su Song. It’s great that Su Song is here.</p><p>Everyone was slightly delighted.</p><p>Before the great competition of the four courtyards, Su Song was ranked eighth on the bronze list. However, he was pushed out of the top ten and ranked eleventh this time because of the rise of Lu Ming and Ling Kong.</p><p>However, his combat power was indeed very strong, much higher than PU sichong’s.</p><p>Junior Brother Su, be careful.</p><p>Duan gang said.</p><p>Both of them were from the Onyx tortoise Hall and had a good relationship with each other. At the same time, they were the two strongest bronze-level disciples in the Onyx tortoise Hall.</p><p>Su Song nodded and walked out.</p><p>Su Song, ranked 11th on the bronze list. Nice to meet you.</p><p>Su Song cupped his fists.</p><p>hehe, 11th place. Looks like there’s finally someone interesting.</p><p>The well-built young man licked his lips and sneered.</p><p>Battle!</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them started fighting.</p><p>The crowd stared at Su Song without blinking, hoping that he would win.</p><p>Su song’s fighting style was very similar to Duan gang’S. He cultivated his physical body and defensive martial arts techniques, which leaned toward defense and close combat.</p><p>As for the strong youth from Qilin Hall, he was more inclined towards close combat.</p><p>The two of them punched at each other and continued to bombard each other like two savage beasts colliding.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense, and fist forces shot out.</p><p>However, the strong young man was indeed very powerful. It was clearly the fourth level of the black level low rank fist technique, but when he used it, the combat power he displayed was stronger than other fist techniques of the same level.</p><p>Su Song had no choice but to activate his bloodline power and fight with him.</p><p>Fortunately, Su song’s defensive martial arts technique was very powerful and blocked the strong young man’s attack.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>damn it, you can block so many of my moves. Watch how I break your turtle shell.</p><p>The well-built youth roared.</p><p>It was as if being blocked for so many moves was a great humiliation to him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The well-built young man’s body flashed with a blood-red light. Then, an ancient boxing glove appeared above his head.</p><p>“The bloodline of the gloves? Could this be the special bloodline of the legends?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and looked on curiously.</p><p>To most people, this was the first time they had seen a special bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline of the gauntlets was jet-black and filled with an ancient aura. Everyone could even see that there were scars on the gauntlets, as if they had experienced a tragic battle. A vast fist intent spread out.</p><p>There were six Meridian cycles on the gloves. Obviously, it was a level six bloodline.</p><p>Then, the bloodline of the gauntlet flashed and disappeared, entering the body of the strong young man. The strong young man’s aura became stronger.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! the strong young man shouted and threw a punch. His fist power was at its peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying fist force hit the turtle-Shell Shield around Su Song.</p><p>Su Song staggered back with a violent explosion. His face was pale, and his defensive martial skill was almost broken.</p><p>“Again, let’s see how many punches you can take.”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The black fist force was extremely violent. Su Song was completely suppressed and could only defend with all his strength.</p><p>But even so, he only managed to block a dozen moves before his defensive martial skill was broken through by the strong young man, and a punch landed on his chest.</p><p>arghh! Su Song screamed. His body flew dozens of meters away and fell heavily on the ground. He coughed up blood and his breathing was weak.</p><p>Su Song was severely injured by one punch.</p><p>“Junior Brother Su!”</p><p>Duan gang hurriedly rushed over. After checking, his face was filled with anger. He glared at the well-built youth and said, ” “It’s just a spar. Aren’t you a little too ruthless?”</p><p>“Who told him to not admit defeat and desperately resist? he asked for it.”</p><p>The well-built young man curled his lips and did not mind.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
