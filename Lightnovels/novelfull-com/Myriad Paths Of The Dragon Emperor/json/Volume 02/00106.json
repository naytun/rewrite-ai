With a ‘bang’, Yao Tianyu’s body was like a huge piece of iron. He charged at Lu Ming and slashed at him.</p><p>The saber Light howled and shook the world.</p><p>“The Dao of body refinement!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He exploded with all his strength and blocked the attack with the giant sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the huge sword and Yao Tianyu’s saber clashed, Lu Ming felt an overwhelming force surging toward him and his body slid back by more than ten meters.</p><p>He only felt his body go numb.</p><p>the path of body cultivation. Yao Tianyu has also cultivated the path of body cultivation. He’s cultivating the same body cultivation technique as he tie. Judging from the level of control, he’s not weaker than he tie. With a strong body and black level saber techniques, Lu Ming is finished. He’s no match for him.</p><p>that’s right. With his strong body and black level saber technique, his combat power is too strong. Yao Tianyu’s ranking on the bronze rank is definitely not just 51st. In my opinion, he can be ranked in the forties. Lu Ming can’t possibly fight against him. Lu Ming is in danger. What a pity for such a genius.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Maybe Lu Ming has also cultivated a black level martial arts technique?”</p><p>“Idiot, Lu Ming has also cultivated a black level martial arts technique? How was this possible? Do you think profound grade martial arts techniques are so easy to cultivate? How long has it been since Lu Ming entered the sect?”</p><p>“One’s cultivation level can be increased rapidly by relying on rare treasures or fortuitous encounters. However, martial arts techniques rely on one’s comprehension and time. Although Lu Ming is very talented, he has too little time. I’m 100% sure that it’s impossible for him to cultivate a black level cultivation technique now.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s sudden outburst caused everyone to fall into a state of shock.</p><p>In the southern grandstand, pang Shi was extremely anxious. “What do we do? Yao Tianyu was actually this strong? What to do? Would senior brother Lu Ming be alright? This is a battle of life and death.”</p><p>“Pang Shi, calm down.”</p><p>Feng Wu called out, but there was worry in her eyes as well.</p><p>Hua Chi and Mu Lan did not say anything. However, their eyes were also filled with worry.</p><p>“Lu Ming, can you still create a miracle?” Mu Lan muttered to herself.</p><p>On the eastern grandstand, Yao Tianyu’s lackeys were ecstatic.</p><p>haha, senior brother Yao is invincible. How can a mere Lu Ming fight with senior brother Yao? he’s destined to die in senior brother Yao’s hands.</p><p>A few lackeys shouted.</p><p>In addition, Feng xinglie, Yan Xu, and the other geniuses on the bronze ranking all stared at the stage with bright eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is my strongest combat power. Do you see it? That’s the difference between us. I can kill you in one minute.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s tone was very arrogant. At the same time, he was full of disdain and mockery towards Lu Ming.</p><p>However, to everyone’s surprise, Lu Ming actually smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled confidently and calmly. His clear voice could be heard from afar, ” this giant sword is really not easy to use. I thought that this sword would be enough to defeat you, but now it seems that I have to change.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the huge sword in Lu Ming’s hand disappeared and an eight-foot long fiery-red spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>“A spear? Could it be that Lu Ming uses a long spear?”</p><p>I heard that he’s always using a sword. Could he be bluffing? ”</p><p>no matter what, in the end, we still have to rely on strength.</p><p>……</p><p>Yao Tianyu looked at the long spear in Lu Ming’s hand. His eyes flickered and he sneered.”What’s the use of changing weapons? Die!”</p><p>With a flash of Saber Light, Yao Tianyu continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fire gun art-broken armor!”</p><p>The spear thrust out, bringing with it an intense spinning cutting force.</p><p>The spear hit the blade of Yao Tianyu’s saber accurately.</p><p>A powerful force burst out from the tip of the spear, and the blade light that Yao Tianyu had condensed on the blade was instantly scattered. With a clang, the battle blade trembled, and Yao Tianyu’s figure staggered back.</p><p>black rank spear technique? impossible!</p><p>Yao Tianyu let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming must have used a black level martial arts technique to push him back with a single spear attack. Moreover, the level of mastery was definitely not weaker than his saber technique.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Three months ago, Lu Ming definitely did not manage to master the black level spear technique. Otherwise, he would have used it in that life-and-death situation.</p><p>There could only be one explanation. Within three months, not only did Lu Ming’s physical body and cultivation level improve, but he had also cultivated a black level spear technique.</p><p>At the thought of this, Yao Tianyu’s heart was filled with intense fear.</p><p>Lu Ming was too freakish and abnormal. This kind of talent was too terrifying.</p><p>“No, no, I must kill him today. Otherwise, I’ll be the one to die in the future.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu roared in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, everyone present was stunned. When Lu Ming pushed back Yao Tianyu with one shot, they were already stunned.</p><p>“Fire gun art-mountain crash!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the initiative and did not give Yao Tianyu the slightest chance. He leaped high into the air and smashed his long spear down fiercely.</p><p>The long spear whizzed through the air, emitting a terrifying Sonic Boom.</p><p>Yao Tianyu had no time to counterattack, so he could only block with his saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear smashed into Yao Tianyu’s battle blade.</p><p>This spear strike contained the power to split the earth and shatter the mountains. Yao Tianyu’s body trembled and his legs trembled. He almost knelt down. He felt something sweet in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>When Lu Ming used the black level martial arts technique, he had completely crushed him.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not show any mercy. He launched a frenzied attack. His long spear was like a dragon, constantly bombarding Yao Tianyu.</p><p>Yao Tianyu spat out a mouthful of blood. He was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>The eyes of the disciples from the four halls almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>a black level martial arts technique. Lu Ming has also cultivated a black level martial arts technique. This is incredible.</p><p>“Who’s that? Weren’t you 100% sure that Lu Ming could not cultivate a black level martial arts technique? What do you say now?”</p><p>“This … ‘This …'”</p><p>The one who was asked blushed and was completely speechless.</p><p>He was not the only one. The disciples of the four courtyards who were certain that Lu Ming could not have cultivated a black level martial arts technique all blushed. Lu Ming’s words were a harsh slap to their faces.</p><p>They did not dare to speak anymore. Lu Ming was simply beyond common sense. They were afraid that if they said too much, they would be slapped in the face again.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother Lu Ming, you’re amazing.”</p><p>Pang Shi’s body trembled with excitement.</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and Hua Chi were overjoyed as well, but they couldn’t hide the shock on their faces.</p><p>“Impossible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s lackeys roared in disbelief.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming’s spear swept across Yao Tianyu’s chest. The sound of bones breaking echoed throughout the entire arena. Yao Tianyu’s body was sent flying more than twenty meters and he fell heavily on the fighting ring.</p><p>His body twitched non-stop, and the saber in his hand flew far away.</p><p>Yao Tianyu had lost. He had been completely defeated.</p><p>He was defeated by Lu Ming, the newcomer King of the year.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards, including the geniuses on the bronze list, held their breath and looked at the two figures on the fighting ring.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
