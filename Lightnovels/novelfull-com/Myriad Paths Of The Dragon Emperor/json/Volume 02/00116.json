He turned around and walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the Vermillion Bird Hall, Liu Hui cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me. I’m not just standing up for you. I just can’t stand the Duanmu family’s attitude. Besides, the Duanmu family and I have a grudge against each other.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Look … You don’t like it?”</p><p>Liu Hui and the other Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were stunned.</p><p>Just because of this reason, he went up and ruthlessly beat up Duanmu yunchong? They felt that they could not figure out Lu Ming’s thoughts.</p><p>The challenge continued.</p><p>The competition was very intense, and everyone was fighting with all their strength.</p><p>It was already night time when all the challenges ended.</p><p>Including Lu Ming, there were a total of five people who succeeded in the challenge, replacing five of the previous thirty people.</p><p>At this time, the top 30 students from the various Academies had all been born.</p><p>Only five people from the Vermillion Bird Hall had made it into the top 30.</p><p>The Onyx tortoise Hall was just as miserable as the Vermillion Bird Hall, with only five people.</p><p>The Azure Dragon Hall had eight members, while The White Tiger Hall had twelve members.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that among the four newcomers who had received a lot of attention this time, Feng xinglie had already been eliminated. Lu Ming, on the other hand, had entered the top 30 as a Dark Horse.</p><p>As for the other two, Ling Kong, the newcomer King from two years ago, and Duanmu Yunyang, the newcomer King from three years ago, they had naturally entered the top 30 with ease.</p><p>“Feng fenglie is still too young. He’s been in the sect for less than two years. It’s normal for him to be eliminated.”</p><p>that’s right. However, if Feng fenglie doesn’t break through to the martial Grandmaster realm in a year or two, the battle of the bronze rank will be his. That’s the normal speed.</p><p>“But what about Lu Ming?”</p><p>Everyone was chatting but they all thought of a name, Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had just entered the sect this year, but he had made it into the top thirty.</p><p>“Lu Ming? He’s abnormal and can’t be calculated according to common sense.”</p><p>Everyone could only comfort themselves with this reason.</p><p>Today’s competition had ended, and it would continue on the second day.</p><p>Lu Ming, pang Shi, and the rest returned to the dormitory.</p><p>After a Night of Silence, they returned to the competition’s location the next morning.</p><p>“Now, the top 30 will come up to draw lots!”</p><p>The host was still the silver-robed elder from yesterday.</p><p>The rules were the same as yesterday. The silver-robed elders would randomly pick fifteen people, and these fifteen people would then pick the names of the other fifteen people.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming drew number 12.</p><p>“Number 12? It seems like I’ve finally met a strong opponent.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curved into a smile of anticipation.</p><p>To be honest, he didn’t even use his full strength in the previous battles.</p><p>After the registration, Lu Ming walked towards his seat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, which number did you draw?”</p><p>Mu Lan asked impatiently as soon as she returned.</p><p>Today, Mu Lan did not sit with her grandfather. Instead, she was squeezed together with Feng Wu, pang Shi, and the others. Naturally, their area was filled with the male Vermillion Bird Hall disciples.</p><p>“Number 12!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Number 12? Azure Dragon Hall’s Gu Qing!”</p><p>Feng Wu, Hua Chi, and the others ‘expressions changed upon hearing this name.</p><p>“Lu Ming, remember, you just have to do your best. Even if you lose, it’s worth it to gain something.”</p><p>Mu Lan heaved a sigh.</p><p>“Um, Senior Sister Mu Lan, from your tone, it sounds like I’m going to lose for sure?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you really think you can win against Gu Qing?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s beautiful eyes flickered as she stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Even if I can’t win, can’t you just cheer me on?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer her directly. Instead, he asked her a question and sat down. However, there was an inexplicable smile at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“This guy? What kind of trump card is he keeping?”</p><p>Mu Lan glared at Lu Ming for a while, as if she wanted to see through his secret.</p><p>the first match officially begins. Number nineteen, PU sichong, versus number fifteen, Ling Kong.</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>Following the silver-robed elder’s announcement, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar.</p><p>Ling Kong has come out. He’s actually going against PU sichong. A battle between the strong. This match is going to be interesting.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Ling Kong hasn’t fought for half a year. No one knows how strong he is now. However, there’s no doubt that Ling Kong has the chance to enter the top ten this time. It might even be possible for him to enter the top six.”</p><p>yeah, the rookie King from two years ago is about to be crowned.</p><p>Two young figures stepped onto the fighting ring under everyone’s gaze.</p><p>Ling Kong was a bald young man of seventeen or eighteen years old. His muscles were bulging, and he was filled with explosive strength. He carried an iron rod on his back, and his eyes revealed a beast-like glint.</p><p>This was Ling Kong, the newcomer King from two years ago, the peerless genius of The White Tiger Hall. However, he was not a member of the Duanmu family.</p><p>Across from Ling Kong was a handsome young man named PU sichong. He was ranked 19th on the bronze list and was definitely a master.</p><p>However, PU sichong’s expression was extremely grave.</p><p>“PU sichong, I advise you to admit defeat. You are not my match.”</p><p>Ling Kong said with a grin.</p><p>His words were arrogant, but in reality, no one felt that he was arrogant. They only felt that Ling Kong’s words were natural because he had the strength to do so.</p><p>PU sichong’s eyes flashed, and he said with determination, ” “Ling Kong, if you want me to admit defeat, let’s see if you have the ability to do so.”</p><p>“Oh? Since you’re so insistent on fighting, then you should be prepared to get injured. Sometimes, I can’t control myself.”</p><p>Ling Kong grinned, revealing a sinister smile.</p><p>“Then take this!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as Ling Kong finished speaking, a vicious light appeared in his eyes. Like a beast, he quickly pounced towards PU si.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The sharp claw light covered PU sichong’s body.</p><p>PU sichong unsheathed his long sword, and the sword Qi shot up to the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The claw radiance in the air collided with PU sichong’s sword Qi and both dissipated.</p><p>you have some skills, but that’s all. Let’s end this!</p><p>A cold voice rang out in the air, and a baleful aura spread out from his body. Like a beast in human form, he pulled out the metal rod on his back and smashed it at PU Sicong.</p><p>This strike was earth-shattering and had an imposing aura.</p><p>PU sichong exploded with all his strength, but he still couldn’t block it. He was sent flying dozens of meters, his body trembling and he spat out blood.</p><p>He was defeated in two moves. In fact, he was defeated in one move.</p><p>The difference between PU sichong’s strength and Ling Kong’s was too great.</p><p>Ling Kong is too powerful. He’ll definitely be able to get into the top ten.</p><p>“This time, there will definitely be some changes in the top ten.”</p><p>……</p><p>On the grandstand, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This Ling Kong was indeed powerful. He could not tell how strong he was.</p><p>“This is more interesting!”</p><p>Then, a trace of fighting spirit flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Ling Kong wins. Next round, number seventeen versus number two!</p><p>The silver-robed elder announced.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
