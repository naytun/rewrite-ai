The rest of the People’s faces were also extremely ugly.</p><p>damn it. Lu Ming’s cultivation has improved so much in just a few months. Senior brother Yao, you must kill him. Otherwise, he might really make it to the bronze rank after some time.</p><p>The red-robed young man said.</p><p>“Why don’t we let Jiang Hao go?”</p><p>A young man suggested.</p><p>Yao Tianyu nodded and instructed. Jiang Hao, you go up. Don’t hold back. Don’t give Lu Ming a chance to admit defeat.</p><p>On the side, a thin youth laughed coldly and said, ” “Senior brother Yao, don’t worry. I won’t give him the chance to say the words ‘I admit defeat’.”</p><p>Then, like a ghost, his body flickered a few times and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Isn’t this Jiang Hao? Jiang Hao from the Azure Dragon Hall.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s him. Why did he make a move? Lu Ming is in danger. A year ago, Jiang Hao had achieved five consecutive victories. However, for some reason, he has not participated in the bronze platform challenge this year. Hence, his results were automatically canceled. However, his ability is definitely above five consecutive victories.”</p><p>it seems like Yao Tianyu has made a move. Lu Ming has once offended Yao Tianyu.</p><p>“Let’s see how Lu Ming will deal with this.”</p><p>As soon as Jiang Hao went on stage, there was a heated discussion.</p><p>“Did Yao Tianyu ask you to come up?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jiang Hao.</p><p>Just now, he had seen Jiang Hao’s figure beside Yao Tianyu.</p><p>“Hehe! “Lu Ming, I wasn’t around when we were at the star Moon Tower the last time. Otherwise, you would have been a corpse by now. But it’s not too late now. If you want to admit defeat, do it now. Wait a moment. I won’t give you any chance.”</p><p>Jiang Hao laughed coldly.</p><p>“This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say to you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>At that moment, the judge announced the start of the match.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, Jiang Hao’s figure disappeared from the spot. When he reappeared, he was already more than twenty meters away. Then, in a flash, he was in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>His figure was as fast as a ghost.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Hao suddenly drew a long sword from his waist.</p><p>This was a soft sword, one wrapped around Jiang Hao’s waist. At this moment, it was suddenly pulled out, making it impossible to guard against.</p><p>In addition, Jiang Hao’s movement technique was extremely fast. He was like an assassin walking in the dark. Generally, even if one’s cultivation was higher than his, they would still fall for his tricks.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming was not an ordinary person.</p><p>“Ultimate flowing light!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the huge sword to perform the fastest move of the lustrous sword technique.</p><p>In the past, he had used a thin sword to perform the lustrous sword technique, and the sword whistle was sharp and dense. Now, he used a giant sword. The speed was equally fast, but the sword whistle was like thunder.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A head flew high into the air and then rolled down the fighting ring, leaving a headless corpse on the fighting ring. Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>One move, one move after another, Jiang Hao, who had won five consecutive victories, was killed on the fighting ring.</p><p>This time, even some geniuses on the bronze list looked serious.</p><p>“What a fast swordsmanship, and what powerful strength.”</p><p>“This Lu Ming’s swordsmanship cultivation is actually average. However, his explosive power is too strong, causing the speed of his swordsmanship to increase by a large margin. He killed Jiang Hao with a single slash.”</p><p>could he have cultivated the body-tempering Dao? ”</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list murmured to themselves.</p><p>“Lu Ming wins!”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced. Then, he called for people to clean up the fighting ring and carry Jiang Hao’s body away.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>On the eastern stands, Yao Tianyu slammed the armrest of his seat. True energy gushed out and shattered the armrest.</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, Lu Ming should have cultivated the body-tempering path.”</p><p>He tie said.</p><p>that’s right. He must have cultivated the body-tempering path. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such explosive power. However, he didn’t cultivate the body-tempering path last time. In just three months, his body can’t be that strong.</p><p>“He tie, if Lu Ming wins eight matches in a row, go up and finish him off.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu ordered.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>He tie nodded.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming cast his gaze toward the east grandstand.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, why did you send your men to their deaths? Don’t worry, it’ll be your turn soon.”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a clear voice.</p><p>Provocation. This was a blatant provocation.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze shifted from Lu Ming to Yao Tianyu.</p><p>They could not help but recall The Grudge between Lu Ming and Yao Tianyu more than three months ago.</p><p>“This is getting interesting!”</p><p>Many people revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>This year’s newcomer King was too domineering. He actually dared to speak to Yao Tianyu like that. Who knew what the consequences would be?</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu laughed out of anger, the killing intent in his eyes unconcealed. He sneered, Lu Ming, I really hope that you can win ten matches in a row and challenge me on the bronze rank. Then, I’ll let you know what despair is.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, you and your dog are really the same. Just now, Jiang Hao told me to admit defeat as soon as possible, otherwise I wouldn’t have a chance. In the end, the facts have proven that he is just a useless person with a mouth full of nonsense. Now, you are the same. Birds of a Feather really do flock together.”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Hmph! Lu Ming, let’s see who’s the one spouting nonsense.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu snorted coldly. His face darkened, but he did not say anything more.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and looked around.”Now, who is going to fight me?”</p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p>They looked at each other, and for a moment, no one went up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was also revealed just now. Jiang Hao was killed by a single sword.</p><p>He definitely had the strength to win seven or even eight times in a row. Who would go up and look for a beating?</p><p>After a long while, a young man jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>However, the young man was very polite. He cupped his fists and said, ” “Junior Brother Lu Ming is a Dragon among men. I know that I’m no match for you, but I can’t help but want to spar with you. I hope that you’ll show mercy.”</p><p>As the saying went, one should not slap a smiling face. Since he was being polite, Lu Ming smiled and said, ” “You’re welcome. Let’s have a spar then.”</p><p>The young man was not weak either. After the start of the competition, Lu Ming deliberately went easy on him. After exchanging more than ten moves with him, the young man admitted defeat.</p><p>Following that, there were no obstacles at all.</p><p>Five wins, six wins, seven wins …</p><p>In the end, he won eight times in a row.</p><p>The people behind him had no grudges with Lu Ming and were very polite to him. Therefore, Lu Ming did not unleash much of his strength and only won by a slight advantage.</p><p>In particular, in the eighth battle, he fought against a young expert who had won seven times in a row. Lu Ming even suppressed his cultivation and exchanged more than thirty moves with him before he won by a slight margin.</p><p>This made many people think that Lu Ming’s combat strength should be around eight consecutive wins.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. If he did not do this, how could he catch a big fish?</p><p>“He tie, I have a rough idea of Lu Ming’s abilities. You can make your move!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu ordered.</p><p>“Don’t worry, senior brother Yao. I’ll break all the bones in his body.”</p><p>He tie smiled cruelly and went up the fighting ring.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
