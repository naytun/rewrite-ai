He was more comfortable in cultivating martial arts techniques.</p><p>Three days later, he made another breakthrough in his midair steps and reached the third level.</p><p>The third stage of a black grade high level martial arts technique was already equivalent to the sixth stage of a black grade low level martial arts technique.</p><p>At this stage of the air walk, Lu Ming could walk on the snow without leaving a trace and walk on the tips of grass.</p><p>This was the real verdure glider.</p><p>If he continued to break through, he would have no problem walking on water.</p><p>Since he had already cultivated the air walk to this stage, Lu Ming spent more time on the true war Dragon technique and the flaming metal technique.</p><p>The cultivation of the physical body was indeed very slow. After a few months of cultivation, Lu Ming’s physical body was still stuck at the lower tier of the second stage. He was still a distance away from the upper tier of the second stage.</p><p>As for his cultivation, Lu Ming felt that he had already reached the peak of the Martial Master realm. He was very close to the martial Grandmaster realm, only one step away.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not need to stop and accumulate as he had cultivated the true war Dragon technique and had already reached the third stage. The density and density of his essential Qi were four times that of ordinary essential Qi. His accumulation was already strong enough.</p><p>As long as he cultivated it to perfection, he would naturally be able to break through.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another twenty days had passed.</p><p>The mystical sword sect once again welcomed its annual recruitment day.</p><p>It had been a year since Lu Ming joined the mystical sword sect.</p><p>These few days, xuanjian city had been extremely lively. There were young men and women full of vitality everywhere.</p><p>On the day of the assessment, there was a long queue in front of the mountain Gate of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming walked casually and came to a square near the front mountain.</p><p>Those who passed the assessment would have to come here to choose which compound to join.</p><p>“Come, come, come. I’ve joined the Azure Dragon Hall. The Azure Dragon Hall is the oldest of the four great halls.”</p><p>“They’ve come to The White Tiger Hall. The White Tiger Hall is the strongest of the four halls.”</p><p>……</p><p>The disciples of the four halls were shouting.</p><p>On the square, the new disciples who had passed the test gathered in groups of two or three to discuss.</p><p>“Let’s join The White Tiger Hall! The White Tiger Hall is the strongest of the four halls. You’ll have a brighter future if you join The White Tiger Hall.”</p><p>“What do you know? Don’t you know that there’s a bronze ranking among the bronze disciples of the four halls? I’ve heard that The White Tiger Hall’s disciples aren’t even in the first and second place of the bronze ranking.”</p><p>I’ve heard about that too. It’s said that the first place on the bronze list is Lu Ming from the Vermillion Bird Hall. He just joined last year and rushed to the first place on the bronze list as soon as he joined. It’s said that not long ago, he even defeated a disciple from the Qilin Hall who has a special bloodline.</p><p>“What? That’s amazing, how did you know?”</p><p>“My big brother is a silver rank disciple, of course he told me.”</p><p>“Let’s join the Vermillion Bird Hall then?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A few youths discussed for a while before walking towards the entrance of the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>let’s go. I want to join the Vermillion Bird Hall. Lu Ming is my idol and my goal. I must win the title of Best Newcomer this year.</p><p>On the other side, a few people were also walking over. One of them was a young man with a heroic spirit.</p><p>“Chasing after Lu Ming? You’re thinking too much? How can ordinary people catch up to that kind of person?”</p><p>The other youth said disdainfully.</p><p>The few of them quarreled and went to the Vermillion Bird Hall to register.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall disciple in charge of registration could not stop smiling.</p><p>The disciples from the other courtyards were extremely envious.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He did not expect that he would be so famous now. Even many teenagers who had not entered the sect had heard of his name.</p><p>Furthermore, it had also helped the Vermillion Bird Hall’s recruitment drive, which was something he had not expected.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not stop and walked toward the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>A Vermillion Bird Hall disciple in charge of registration saw Lu Ming and greeted him with a smile.</p><p>All of a sudden, the disciples who had just joined the sect fixed their gazes on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Could he be Lu Ming? So young? He’s about the same as us.”</p><p>“Nonsense. Lu Ming was a disciple who joined last year. Of course, he’s about the same age as us.”</p><p>he’s Lu Ming. He’s so handsome!</p><p>The new disciples, both male and female, looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and nodded at the senior disciple. Then, he headed to the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>“It’s time to break through to the great Martial Master realm.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The main reason he came out today was to relax and adjust his state. He was going to break through to the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>He wasn’t the first one to make a breakthrough on the bronze list.</p><p>Half a month ago, he had heard that Zhang Muyun had broken through to the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>He believed that many geniuses who had been on the bronze rank for one or two years would choose to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to his dormitory. Instead, he headed to the higher part of the Vermilion Bird Peak.</p><p>The place he was going to was called the clam cave. It was a rather famous cultivation place in the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Legend had it that this place once had a real Phoenix’s dwelling, so it was called the Phoenix cave.</p><p>Of course, this was only a legend. Not many people believed it. A true hou was an immemorial divine beast. It had long since disappeared from the world. Some people speculated that in the distant past, there might have been a Supreme flying demon dwelling there.</p><p>Because the spiritual energy in the clam cave was extremely rich, and it was inclined to the fire attribute, which was very suitable for a breakthrough.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, if a Vermillion Bird Hall disciple wanted to enter the Qiqi cave to cultivate, they would need to pay contribution points. Furthermore, they could not enter just because they had contribution points. The number of places was extremely limited, and there was a fixed number of people every month.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not need any contribution points. This was the reward given to him by the Vermillion Bird Hall when he won first place in the competition between the four courtyards. He could enter the clam cave to cultivate for a month without any contribution points.</p><p>The journey was smooth and without any obstacles. Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the clam cave.</p><p>The entrance of the kun cave was sealed by a stone door. In front of the door, there was an old man guarding it. The old man’s eyes were closed and he was motionless.</p><p>“Stop, the clam cave is an important place in the Vermillion Bird Hall. No one is allowed to enter.”</p><p>Suddenly, the old man opened his eyes. Lu Ming seemed to see two sword lights shooting out. An aura as strong as a mountain was exuded from the old man’s body.</p><p>an expert. He is definitely a martial arts Grandmaster level expert.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“This junior went to the Qiqi cave to cultivate.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>“Cultivated? If I’m not mistaken, there’s no quota for this month.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Dean Yan said that I can come anytime.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his identity Jade card and passed it to the elder.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes brightened. He picked up the identity Jade card and looked at it. A smile appeared on his face as he said, that’s right. You can enter at any time. The time limit is one month. Go in.</p><p>The old man returned the identity Jade card to Lu Ming. With a wave of his hand, the stone door of the Luan Qi cave opened.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists again and strode in.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
