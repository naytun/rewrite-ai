Their eyes widened as they stared at the giant Silver Wolf above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Heavens, this was actually the soul of a Demon King?</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>A Demon King! What kind of existence was that? If he was still alive, he would be able to destroy a sect like the mystical sword sect.</p><p>It was extremely powerful. With a wave of its hand, it could cut off a Great River, split a mountain, and had the power to destroy the world.</p><p>How did Lu Ming obtain the soul of such an existence?</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to merge the Demon King’s soul? You’re crazy, you’re courting death. How can you fuse with the soul of the monster King?”</p><p>The silver-robed elder roared.</p><p>“Melt!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely firm as he softly spat out one word.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant Silver Wolf howled and charged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming let out a furious roar. The aura on his body rose sharply. A ray of light rushed out and the silver-robed elder’s palm force was destroyed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body emitted a dazzling white light. Even his hair turned silver.</p><p>His long silver hair danced in the wind. At this moment, Lu Ming looked like a demon.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and thrust his spear forward. A silver-white spear radiance burst out.</p><p>The target was the silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family. His speed was unbelievable.</p><p>“What the f * ck? why didn’t you explode?”</p><p>The silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family roared in disbelief.</p><p>How could a mere second grade great Martial Master withstand the power of the Demon King’s soul?</p><p>However, he did not know that Lu Ming was able to resist the brutal power of the Demon King’s soul because of his spirit-devouring bloodline.</p><p>However, even so, the pressure that Lu Ming was under was still unimaginably great.</p><p>The power of the soul of the daemon King was too strong. Although it was only half, it allowed Lu Ming’s strength to increase rapidly. He broke through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm in one fell swoop, giving Lu Ming the ability to fight with a martial arts Grandmaster for the time being.</p><p>However, this brutal force had caused serious injuries to Lu Ming’s body. His bones were groaning as if they would break at any time.</p><p>“If I don’t kill Lu yunxiong, I won’t explode. Since you’re trying to stop me, I’ll kill you first,”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His aura was like a rainbow. He moved and stepped on the air, charging toward the silver-robed elder.</p><p>“So what if you’ve fused with a beast soul? Do you really think you can contend with me? I will let you understand how naive you are!”</p><p>The silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family roared and exploded with all his power.</p><p>At this moment, the entire square was enveloped in an indescribable pressure.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two figures clashed in the air, creating an earth-shattering boom.</p><p>Bang! Then, a figure retreated frantically.</p><p>The silver-robed elder. It was the silver-robed elder.</p><p>“Martial ancestor 1-stage, you’re only so-so!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed loudly. His aura became more and more terrifying. He took a step forward and his body turned into a silver light, charging towards the silver-robed elder.</p><p>The silver-robed elder’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>He had only read about using one’s body to fuse with a beast’s soul in ancient books. He did not expect it to be so powerful that even with his first level martial arts Grandmaster cultivation, he was no match for it.</p><p>“Hold him off. As long as I can hold him off for a while, when the other experts from The White Tiger Hall arrive, Lu Ming, that little bastard, will be dead for sure,”</p><p>The silver-robed elder’s mind raced as he gritted his teeth and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were a few consecutive rumbles. Everyone could only see two flashes of light in the sky. They kept colliding with each other, erupting with loud rumbles and air waves.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After more than ten moves, a figure flew back hundreds of meters like a tail, leaving a long trail of light.</p><p>As the light dissipated, everyone could see the silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family standing in the air, trembling. He was spitting out blood and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>In the square, it was difficult to describe the feelings of everyone at this time.</p><p>It was too shocking. Lu Ming had actually injured a Grandmaster. It was unbelievable and too shocking.</p><p>Although all of this seemed to have happened slowly, it had actually happened in the time of a dozen breaths.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>At the edge of the square, Lu yunxiong was so scared that he was trembling and almost cried.</p><p>Initially, when he saw the silver-robed elder, he thought that he was finally safe and Lu Ming would not be able to do anything to him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming fused with the soul of a Demon King and exploded, injuring the silver-robed elder in one fell swoop. He was almost scared to death.</p><p>run. We have to run. Lu Ming, this little bastard, is too evil.</p><p>Lu yunxiong roared in his heart. He turned around and ran towards the top of The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“Lu yunxiong, you can’t run away!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He moved and turned into a stream of light, instantly appearing above Lu yunxiong’s head.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong shrieked in fear. He jumped ten meters high and turned around to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and clenched his fist in the air. A Silver Palm condensed in the air and grabbed at Lu yunxiong. Lu yunxiong could not resist at all and was caught by the silver Palm.</p><p>“Argh! Don’t, don’t kill me, help, help!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong’s old face turned red as he frantically jabbed his hands and feet with needles while he screamed madly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let go of him. Do you know who he is? He’s Duanmu Lin’s father-in-law. If you kill him, you’ll be in deep trouble, do you know that?”</p><p>The silver-robed elder of the Duanmu family flew over and shouted.</p><p>“A great disaster? Just because he was Duanmu Lin’s father-in-law? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly.</p><p>Then, he exerted force in his claw and cracking sounds came from Lu yunxiong’s body. Countless bones were crushed and Lu yunxiong started to scream in pain.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, don’t kill me. I’m your elder!”</p><p>Lu yunxiong shouted.</p><p>“Bullshit!” Lu Ming shouted coldly, his eyes were cold.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>At this moment, an anxious voice sounded from the sky. Then, a ray of light flew over from the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he looked at the stream of light.</p><p>There were two figures in the light.</p><p>One of them was Lu Yao.</p><p>The other person was a young man around 17 or 18 years old. He was dressed in black, and he was handsome and cold. A terrifying aura emanated from him.</p><p>A martial arts Grandmaster. This young man, who looked to be 17 or 18 years old, was actually a top expert in the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin! That’s Duanmu Lin!”</p><p>“My God! He’s flying in the air! He’s at the martial ancestor realm! Duanmu Lin has broken through to the martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>“It’s true. Duanmu Lin is only 18 years old. An 18-year-old Grandmaster? this is too terrifying. There are only a few of them in our mystical sword sect since ancient times!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is finished!”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle couldn’t help but shout when they saw this young man.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>Yao ‘er, save father. Save father! Lu Ming wants to kill me!</p><p>Hearing Lu Yao’s voice, Lu yunxiong seemed to have grabbed onto his last life-saving straw as he shouted with all his might.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stream of light was very fast. It arrived in a few breaths and stopped in the air not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
