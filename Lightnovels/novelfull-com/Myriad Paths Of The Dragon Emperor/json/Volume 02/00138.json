The strong young man was too strong. Even Su Song, who was ranked 11th, was defeated. Did he really have to be one of the top ten geniuses?</p><p>The other party was only a disciple who had just entered the sect this year and was only at the early ninth grade master realm. If they sent out one of the top ten geniuses, even if they won, it would be a huge loss of face.</p><p>From now on, the bronze ranking would no longer have any prestige among the four great academies.</p><p>If a genius on the bronze ranking was trampled by a new disciple of Qilin Hall, what prestige would he have left?</p><p>However, if he didn’t fight, people would think that the entire bronze rank was afraid of a new disciple from Qilin Hall.</p><p>Unless they won a big victory today, the bronze rank was destined to lose all its face.</p><p>“Ta!” &Nbsp; stomp …</p><p>A person stepped out, and everyone’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>It was Ling Kong. Was he going to make a move?</p><p>Ling Kong walked in front of the strong young man and said with a cold expression, ” “You’re no match for me, switch!”</p><p>Even when facing the disciples of Qilin Hall, Ling Kong was still overbearing.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. We’ll know after the battle!”</p><p>The well-built young man laughed, his aura overbearing.</p><p>Junior Brother, your bloodline has already erupted. You’ll be at a disadvantage if you fight him. Let me do it.</p><p>Jian wuchen smiled and took a few steps forward.</p><p>“Haha, senior martial brother Jian, you’re going to make a move? I thought senior brother Jian wasn’t interested in these pieces of trash!”</p><p>The well-built youth laughed.</p><p>Jian wuchen revealed a disdainful smile and said, ” they’re still thinking that they’re lucky. They’re still thinking that they can fight with us. I’ll completely defeat them and let them clearly recognize themselves.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother Jian is right!”</p><p>The strong youth and the saber-wielding youth both laughed.</p><p>“You’re full of bullshit. Strength isn’t something you can boast about. It’s true ability. Let me see what kind of ability you have.”</p><p>Ling Kong’s eyes were filled with killing intent. His body began to emit cracking sounds and began to expand rapidly.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Ling Kong’s originally strong body had grown even stronger, like a giant ape.</p><p>From the beginning, Ling Kong had already used the Mad beast technique.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>With a loud roar, the thick iron rod whistled and swept toward Jian wuchen.</p><p>As the metal cudgel swept past, the space seemed to tremble. Clearly, Ling Kong’s combat strength had improved again in the past few months.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Jian wuchen didn’t draw his sword. Instead, he put two fingers together to form a sword and slashed out.</p><p>A beam of sword Qi that was as solid as a real substance and as crystal clear as Jade slashed towards the sky.</p><p>“Congealing Qi into weapons? how is that possible?”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were shocked.</p><p>Condensing Qi into a weapon was a technique that only a great Martial Master could use. Jian wuchen was only a peak ninth grade master, but he could already use the technique of a great Martial Master. It was simply terrifying.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The crystal-clear sword Qi collided with the iron rod in the air, making a shocking boom.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After that, Ling Kong grunted and took seven or eight steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“What? A single sword strike sent a peak state expert flying back seven or eight steps?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They simply couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Jian wuchen didn’t even use his sword. It looked like a casual slash. Wasn’t this too powerful?</p><p>“Oh? Not bad, you managed to take a hit with 40% of my strength. It seems that not all of the bronze rank are trash.”</p><p>Jian Wushuang said indifferently.</p><p>Everyone was even more shocked. That sword just now was only 40% of his power? How was that possible?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Ling Kong roared.</p><p>The other party didn’t even pull out his sword, and his bloodline didn’t erupt. Ling Kong found it hard to accept that he had only used 40% of his strength. He thought that the other party had said that on purpose to lower their morale.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He took a heavy step in the air and his huge body pounced on Jian Wushuang like a furious demonic beast. The iron rod whistled and smashed down. Even a small hill would be smashed into pieces.</p><p>“Then 60%!”</p><p>Jian wuchen took a step forward and thrust his sword finger forward.</p><p>An emerald green sword Qi burst out, as if it had pierced through space. It flashed and disappeared. When it reappeared, it was already in front of Ling Kong.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Ling Kong’s expression changed drastically. It was too late for him to retract his cudgel to block the attack. He could only use all of his true energy to resist the attack.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as Ling Kong’s shoulder was pierced through. He was sent flying back dozens of meters, leaving behind a trail of blood.</p><p>He was defeated. Not only was Jian wuchen’s sword extremely powerful, but it was also incredibly fast.</p><p>“Brute force alone won’t do. Next!”</p><p>Jian wuchen said in a disdainful voice.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>With Ling Kong’s combat strength, he was actually defeated in two moves. Furthermore, the other party said that he had only used 60% of his strength. Although he didn’t know if this was true or not, his strength was simply unfathomable and terrifying.</p><p>Now, the only ones who were stronger than Ling Kong were Duan gang, bu xingkai, and Zhang Muyun.</p><p>Duan gang’s strength was similar to Ling Kong’s, so he was definitely not Jian wuchen’s opponent.</p><p>The remaining two people were Zhang Muyun and bu xingkai.</p><p>Today was the day of Zhang Muyun’s engagement. Did he have to make Zhang Muyun do it personally?</p><p>Bu xingkai frowned. He didn’t want to take action, but he had to.</p><p>This wasn’t just a matter of one courtyard, but the entire bronze rank. He couldn’t stay out of it.</p><p>Finally, bu xingkai walked out of the crowd.</p><p>“Bu xingkai is going to make a move?”</p><p>Everyone had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>After all, bu xingkai was ranked fourth, which was higher than Duan gang and Ling Kong. Everyone hoped that he could win. Even if he couldn’t win, he could force his opponent to use all his strength, so that Zhang Muyun would have more confidence.</p><p>“I’m bu xingkai, a disciple of The White Tiger Hall. May I know your name, senior brother?”</p><p>Bu xingkai cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Who cares what your name is? Don’t try to get close to me, and don’t think I’ll go easy on you.”</p><p>Jian wuchen waved his hand casually, disdaining bu xingkai.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Bu xingkai was at a loss for words, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen a disciple from Qilin Hall. The other party’s strength had shocked him. He had wanted to make friends with them, but he had not expected to be sneered at in public. He had lost all his face.</p><p>The storage ring on his hand glowed, and a long spear appeared in bu xingkai’s hand.</p><p>“Look at you, you can’t be that strong. Hurry up and attack. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance to attack.”</p><p>Jian wuchen said.</p><p>Bu xingkai’s eyes flashed with a cold light. Even Zhang Muyun and Duanmu Yunyang had never looked down on him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bu xingkai made his move. His long spear pierced through the air and headed toward Jian wuchen.</p><p>Jian wuchen smiled faintly. He still didn’t draw his sword, but faced the attack with his sword fingers.</p><p>He pointed out his sword finger, and with a constant “Chi Chi” sound, an endless stream of Jade-colored sword Qi burst out.</p><p>Ding ding ding …</p><p>After a series of clashing sounds, bu xingkai kept retreating. He was obviously at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Toxic Dragon drill!”</p><p>Bu xingkai shouted and used his unique skill.</p><p>The long spear spun rapidly like a poisonous Dragon and pounced toward Jian wuchen.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
