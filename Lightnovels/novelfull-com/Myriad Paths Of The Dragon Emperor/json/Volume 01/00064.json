Even if the Zhu family was wealthy, it would still be a huge expense.</p><p>“If you don’t, then forget it.”</p><p>The three ghost Masters of Mount Yin said.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll give it to you.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan gritted his teeth.</p><p>“I think we should pay half of the deposit first.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun added.</p><p>“Half of the deposit?” Zhu Chuan looked hesitant.</p><p>“Second elder, why don’t you pay first? The young miss’s safety is more important.”</p><p>Said uncle Fu.</p><p>This uncle Fu was the coachman of the Zhu family’s eldest miss.</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll pay half first.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan gritted his teeth and returned to the tent. He took out a stack of silver notes, each of which was ten thousand taels. He gave Lu Ming and the others a hundred thousand taels each.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming kept it without any hesitation.</p><p>“Haha, in that case, I think we should take turns to be on guard. This is to prevent the Zhou family from ambushing us.”</p><p>The yin mountain three ghosts all smiled after receiving the silver.</p><p>Zhu Chuan immediately ordered the guards of the Zhu family to be on full alert.</p><p>Naturally, someone would deal with Chen Xin’s corpse.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the tent of the Lu family’s eldest young lady, a strange look in his eyes.</p><p>He had always felt that this matter was very strange.</p><p>Moreover, they had not even seen the Zhu family’s eldest miss for a few days.</p><p>He had been hiding in the carriage all day, acting all mysterious.</p><p>Zhu Chuan said that the eldest daughter of the Zhu family was not in good health recently and was afraid of catching a cold.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while. He discussed with the three ghosts of the yin mountain and the rest on how to arrange for them to take turns to be on guard. Then, he returned to the tent.</p><p>In the second half of the night, Lu Ming went out to be on guard.</p><p>There was no movement throughout the night.</p><p>The next day, they continued their journey.</p><p>The next few days were peaceful.</p><p>On the eighth day, everyone was already close to the dark blood Mountain. The terrain gradually became desolate.</p><p>At this point, everyone was on full alert and on full alert.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>When they passed by a mountain path, sharp air-piercing sounds suddenly came from both sides. A dense wave of arrows was shot at them.</p><p>“Not good, enemy attack, full defense!”</p><p>Zhu Chuan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xu Feiyun, and the rest had already soared into the sky. Sword radiance flashed and the arrows were cut into two in the air.</p><p>Then, they released their true Qi and swept up the broken arrows. The arrows were reflected back at a speed faster than when they were shot.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Then, a scream was heard.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of horse hooves came from ahead, stirring up a cloud of dust.</p><p>A group of more than a hundred people were riding their war horses and rumbling over.</p><p>A group of people appeared in front of them. They were all strong and burly men, and their bodies were filled with a murderous aura. They revealed that their cultivation was not weak, and ordinary people could not compare to them.</p><p>“Hand over all your treasures and women, and you can get lost.”</p><p>The leader of the group, a burly man with a full beard, shouted.</p><p>As expected, they had encountered bandits.</p><p>“I think you’re the ones who should get lost.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun shouted loudly, and his figure pounced out like lightning.</p><p>His movement technique was very fast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a sword light cut through the air and struck at the leading Bandit.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>The expression of the leader of the bandits changed drastically. He drew out his large saber and barely managed to block a few moves before he was killed by Xu Feiyun’s sword.</p><p>the ninth leader has been killed. Retreat!</p><p>The other bandits were shocked and retreated like a swarm of bees, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Aren’t these bandits too weak?”</p><p>Xu Feiyun walked back and pouted.</p><p>“Young hero Xu, it’s not that the bandits are weak. It’s just that the stronger ones haven’t come out yet.”</p><p>The boss of the three Yin mountain ghosts.</p><p>They had been in the martial world for many years and knew that these bandits were not as simple as they seemed.</p><p>next, be on full alert. Don’t be careless.</p><p>Zhu Chuan ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The guards of the Zhu family responded one after another.</p><p>Then, everyone continued to move forward.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, the deafening sound of horse hooves rang out again.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Everyone knew that the real challenge was coming.</p><p>“These bandits are truly endless. This time, let me kill them all.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun’s expression turned stern.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the dust filled the air, a few hundred people appeared in front of them.</p><p>So many people?</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p><p>A few hundred people, densely packed, stopped in front of them.</p><p>“Who is it that dared to kill my ninth brother? come out and face your death.”</p><p>The leader of the bandits was seven feet tall and muscular. He carried a huge machete on his back, and his voice was like a great Bell. His aura was oppressive.</p><p>“Great master, it was that pretty boy who killed him.”</p><p>One of the lackeys pointed at Xu Feiyun and shouted.</p><p>“So it’s you, pretty boy. Come out and face your death!”</p><p>The great master roared.</p><p>“I think you’re the one who’s going to die.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun was proud and arrogant, and yet he was actually looked down upon by a Bandit at this moment. Killing intent flashed in his eyes, and he leaped off his green-scaled horse. He unsheathed his long sword and charged towards the great master.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! the great master shouted, and his tall figure also jumped from his War Horse. The large blade in his hand slashed out a pale blade light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blade and the sword clashed. Xu Feiyun’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?” Xu Feiyun’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Trash, kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the leader shouted and slashed out dozens of times.</p><p>The astral blade howled and enveloped Xu Feiyun’s entire body.</p><p>“Flying Cloud sword technique!”</p><p>Xu Feiyun tried his best to use the Flying Cloud sword technique, but he still couldn’t block the great master. In just ten moves, Xu Feiyun was sent flying, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The cultivation of the first master had actually reached the peak of the sixth grade master realm.</p><p>“I’ll deal with him!”</p><p>The leader of the three Yin mountain ghosts moved and rushed out.</p><p>He used an iron rod and ruthlessly smashed it at the bandit boss.</p><p>As the iron rod smashed down, it made a ‘hu hu’ sound as if the air was about to be shattered.</p><p>The leader of the three Yin mountain ghosts was also a peak sixth grade master realm.</p><p>It could be said that his cultivation was the highest among them.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The saber and the iron rod collided, and both of them took three steps back.</p><p>“I can’t believe there’s an expert like you. But do you think you can do anything by yourself? Kill them all!”</p><p>The leader of the bandits waved his hand, and hundreds of bandits immediately rushed over.</p><p>“Protect the young miss.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan shouted. Dozens of guards from the Zhu family surrounded the carriage of the Zhu family’s eldest miss.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he rushed out.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>He performed the lustrous sword technique as fast as lightning. With each strike, several bandits had their throats cut off.</p><p>Wherever his body passed, blood would flow.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
