Stop … Ah? It’s the young master, it’s the young master.”</p><p>The guard in front of the Lu clan’s estate shouted, but he immediately reacted and shouted.</p><p>“Young master is back. Young master, please come in.”</p><p>The guard hurriedly said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded. He led the dark blood Wolf into the Lu residence.</p><p>“Good day, young master!”</p><p>“The young master is back!”</p><p>“The young master is back!”</p><p>After entering the Lu family, the people of the Lu family greeted Lu Ming respectfully when they saw him. Then, the news spread quickly throughout the Lu family.</p><p>“Young master is so powerful, he actually brought such a powerful demonic beast.”</p><p>that’s right. I feel that this demonic beast is even scarier than many of the elders. It’s actually so well-behaved in front of the young master.</p><p>of course. The young master is a disciple of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Some of the Lu family’s servants looked at Lu Ming from afar, especially at the dark blood Wolf. They were in a heated discussion, their faces full of respect.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. He had just caught a dark blood Wolf as a means of transportation. He did not expect it to cause such a big commotion.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the main residence.</p><p>At the main residence’s entrance, Li Ping was already looking forward to it. She had obviously heard the news.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, Li Ping’s face broke into a happy smile.</p><p>“Mother, I’ve come back to see you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said affectionately.</p><p>Then, he patted the dark blood Wolf’s neck and said, ” “Obediently lie down at the door and don’t move. Otherwise, I’ll kill you to go with my wine.”</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The dark blood Wolf howled pitifully a few times before lying on the ground obediently.</p><p>Li Ping and the maidservants behind her were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Mother, let’s go in and talk.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Good! Good!”</p><p>Li Ping said.</p><p>There was a stone table in the main residence’s courtyard. At this moment, Li Ping’s maidservant had already set up desserts and brewed tea.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, how have you been?”</p><p>Li Ping asked with concern.</p><p>Looking at Li Ping’s concerned eyes, Lu Ming’s heart felt warm. Do you think I’ve become stronger?”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he even gestured with his arms.</p><p>“Look at how smug you are.”</p><p>Li Ping laughed and scolded him. Then, she changed her tone and asked, ” “Ming ‘er, where’s Qiu Yue? Didn’t you come back together?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said,”mother, how’s Qiuyue doing?” She’s a genius disciple of the mystical sword sect now.”</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained what had happened to them during this period.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not mention anything that was dangerous to Li Ping so that she would not worry.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Qiu Yue to have such talent. I’m really happy for her.”</p><p>Upon hearing that Qiu Yue had joined the mystical sword sect’s most mysterious and powerful Qilin Hall, Li Ping was also very happy.</p><p>Qiu Yue had followed her for many years and she had treated Qiu Yue like her own daughter. Now that Qiu Yue had become successful, he was naturally happy.</p><p>The mother and son continued to chat.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from outside the door. It was the roar of the dark blood Wolf.</p><p>“Young master, it’s US.”</p><p>Then, an old voice was heard.</p><p>“The core elder of the elder Council.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He quickly got up and walked out of the door.</p><p>At that moment, the dark blood Wolf was standing at the door. Its red fur stood on end as it glared at the five old men.</p><p>These five old men were the core elders of the elder Council.</p><p>“What are you doing? Get down.”</p><p>Lu Ming slapped the dark blood Wolf again.</p><p>The dark blood Wolf whimpered and obediently lay on the ground again.</p><p>“Young master, is this your Warbeast? It’s so powerful. I’m afraid it’s a class 2 second level demonic beast.”</p><p>A core elder said as he looked at the dark blood Wolf with a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p>A second grade second level demonic beast was equivalent to a second grade master realm.</p><p>In the Lu clan, most of the elders were only at the first grade master realm.</p><p>Only a small number of elders, including the core elders of the elder Council, were above the second grade master realm.</p><p>This dark blood Wolf could be considered a top expert in the Lu family.</p><p>The young master actually had such a demonic beast as his Battle Beast? He was really amazing.</p><p>A few core elders thought to themselves.</p><p>“Oh? This dark blood Wolf? It’s not my war beast, it’s something I caught along the way as a means of transportation. Its speed is still alright, slightly faster than the green scale horse.”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Ah? What? A means of transportation that you randomly grabbed?”</p><p>The five core elders were stunned. Then, they looked at each other in disbelief.</p><p>“Elders, is there anything I can help you with?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing much. It’s just that the young master hasn’t returned for a long time, so I came to see him,”</p><p>The five core elders looked at each other and one of them said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. He had a feeling that the five core elders were hiding something from him.</p><p>“Elder, elder, bad news!”</p><p>At this moment, a burly man ran over in a hurry and called out anxiously.</p><p>The five core elders ‘expressions suddenly changed and they asked in unison, ” “What happened?”</p><p>The middle-aged man glanced at the five elders and then at Lu Ming. He said,”The Psammophis Pirates and the skeleton Pirates have come to attack again. This time, they’re attacking the refined iron mine in the South. The refined iron mine has been surrounded.”</p><p>“What? He actually went to sneak attack the refined iron mine, damn it. ”</p><p>One of the core elders roared.</p><p>The other core elders also looked worried.</p><p>“Elders, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Hey, young master, it’s like this …”</p><p>One of the core elders began to explain.</p><p>The demonic beast mountain range stretched for thousands of miles and crossed several cities. There were many bandits active in the demonic beast mountain range.</p><p>Near fiery wind city were the Psammophis Pirates.</p><p>As for the dry bone bandits, they were a group of bandits that were active near another big city. They were many times stronger than the Psammophis Pirates.</p><p>About half a month ago, for some reason, the Psammophis Pirates suddenly colluded with the dry bone Pirates and started to attack some of the Lu family’s mines and trade caravans.</p><p>The Lu clan had naturally organized experts to encircle and annihilate them, but there were many experts among the dry bone bandits.</p><p>The leader of the dry bone bandits was a fifth grade master realm expert. A few days ago, the Lu family’s core elders had been dispatched. However, the strongest core elder of the Lu family, who was a fourth grade master realm expert, had been injured by the dry bone bandits ‘leader and was still unable to get out of bed.</p><p>“Psammophis Pirates, skeleton Pirates?”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>He was very familiar with the Psammophis Pirates. His first start-up capital had been stolen from their lair.</p><p>how dare they attack the Lu family. Let’s go. I’ll destroy them.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>young lord, don’t act rashly. The leader of the dry bone bandits is a fifth grade master realm expert. I know that you’re talented, but you’ve only joined the mystical sword sect not long ago. We can’t defend ourselves for now. The Psammophis Pirates and the dry bone bandits are small in numbers, so it’s impossible to break through.</p><p>Hearing that Lu Ming was about to charge over, the five core elders ‘expressions changed and they hurriedly advised him.</p><p>“That’s right, Ming ‘er, don’t act rashly,”</p><p>Li Ping also advised.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
