He even asked Lu Ming to kneel down and apologize. If he was not an idiot, what was he?</p><p>With a sway of his body, Lu Ming left the pile of rubble.</p><p>At this moment, a few figures rushed over.</p><p>They were all young people. Further away, there were five young men who surrounded more than a dozen secret practitioners and ordinary people who were picking up Firestones.</p><p>“Junior Brother Zhao, what’s going on?”</p><p>One of the men who was running over asked.</p><p>“Senior brother, this little bastard, he actually dared to sneak attack me. If you move, you have to cripple him for me.”</p><p>The young man from before shouted.</p><p>brat, how dare you hurt a disciple of my ten directions Sword School. Now, I’ll cripple your cultivation and then obediently help us scout the way inside. Perhaps we can still keep our lives.</p><p>One of the chubby disciples from the ten directions Sword School said.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming coldly with an arrogant expression.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose speechlessly. This was a disciple of the omnipresent sword sect? Why did they all have the same behavior and look like they were superior?</p><p>The ten direction Sword School was indeed the number one sect in the burning sun Empire, but there was no need for everyone to put on such a high and mighty expression, right?</p><p>“Kid, I’m talking to you. Are you deaf?”</p><p>The chubby young man shouted coldly.</p><p>“You asked me to Scout the way in and even captured so many ordinary people. What do you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer. Instead, he asked curiously.</p><p>“Nonsense, is this something you can ask? Obediently go and Scout the way!”</p><p>The chubby young man said coldly, then he threw a punch at Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>The chubby young man had the cultivation of a seventh grade master realm. His punch was extremely powerful. If it landed, it would definitely destroy Lu Ming’s cyclone and cripple his cultivation.</p><p>This was the Shi Fang sword sect, extremely domineering. If they didn’t agree, they would destroy your cultivation.</p><p>the ten direction Sword School, hehe. We’ll have to fight them sooner or later, so I’ll collect some interest first.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>Lu Yuntian might have fallen into the hands of the ten direction sword sect. Lu Ming did not have a good impression of the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>Now, it was even worse.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Flame Dragon Fist blasted out, and his fist force was faster and more ruthless.</p><p>A punch accurately hit the fat young man’s stomach. The fat young man’s eyes instantly bulged out. Immediately, he let out a shrill scream. His fat body flew out like a ball, flying nearly 20 meters away before falling to the ground. He rolled a few times before stopping.</p><p>“Ah, ah, you destroyed my cultivation? You actually destroyed my cultivation, bastard, bastard.”</p><p>The chubby young man let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“You’re the only one allowed to cripple my cultivation, but I’m not allowed to cripple yours?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The remaining two young men roared and unsheathed their long swords. Two sharp sword lights burst out and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them were both seventh grade master realm.</p><p>“Fire gun art-moon pulling!”</p><p>With a move of his hand, the fire vein spear appeared. He swept the spear across. In the sky, a fiery red light flashed like a moon.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two young men from the ten directions sword sect were unable to resist at all. They were sent flying by the long spear, and they vomited blood in the air. When they fell, they were no longer breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s shot had already broken their bones and their internal organs were shattered.</p><p>The chubby young man and the young man from before were stunned. Their faces turned pale and their bodies trembled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the young man with the broken hand.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The young man with the broken hand shouted in fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved. He raised his long spear.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, the five disciples of the ten directions Sword School who had surrounded the stone pickers all rushed over. One of them let out a loud roar and revealed his powerful cultivation at the peak of the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The young man with the broken hand cried out in fear and ran for his life toward the five disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>However-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming swung the long spear in his hand and it shot out like lightning. It caught up with the young man with the broken hand in an instant and pierced through his chest from the back, nailing him to the ground.</p><p>“Die! Die! Little bastard, not only will you die, but your family and friends will also die!”</p><p>The peak eighth grade master realm disciple let out an angry roar and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s see who dies first!”</p><p>Using the Dragon serpent steps, Lu Ming turned into a gust of wind and rushed towards the five men from the omnidirectional sword sect. When he passed by the one-armed young man, he pulled out his fire-patterned spear.</p><p>Both parties were rapidly approaching.</p><p>“Wild wave slash!”</p><p>The eighth grade master realm disciple roared. He held a huge sword that was as wide as a palm with both hands, and the sword light was like a storm, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The fire vein spear shook and swept forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear and the sword clashed, sending sparks flying in all directions and creating a massive boom.</p><p>The disciple from the omnipresent sword sect trembled and took a dozen steps back, while Lu Ming’s body trembled and swayed slightly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The next moment, the other four disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect slashed their swords at Lu Ming.</p><p>Out of the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire, only the ten direction Sword School and the mystical sword School specialized in sword techniques, and the sword techniques they specialized in were slightly different.</p><p>The sword techniques cultivated by the ten directions Sword School leaned towards being firm and fierce. They were bold and powerful.</p><p>The four disciples from the omnipresent Sword School, two eighth grade and two seventh grade master realm, joined forces. Their sword Qi was like a raging wave, sweeping toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As he attacked, he also used bloodline explosion, which was much more powerful.</p><p>However, they were facing Lu Ming, who had already cultivated the black level low level martial arts technique to the second level.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright. The essential Qi in his entire body burst out and he swept his spear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were four consecutive explosions, and at the same time, four screams.</p><p>The two seventh grade master realm disciples were instantly killed and sent flying far away.</p><p>The two eighth grade master realm young men weren’t any better off. They were sent flying for more than ten meters before crashing heavily onto the ground. They coughed up large mouthfuls of blood and were also severely injured.</p><p>One spear strike had killed two and injured two, shocking the peak eighth grade master realm disciple.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him any chance to catch his breath. He rushed forward a few steps and then jumped high up, smashing the fire-patterned gun down.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>The long spear smashed down with a shrill whistling sound. The disciple from the ten directions Sword School turned pale. He exploded with all his strength and circulated the power of his bloodline to the extreme. His combat sword slashed upwards.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear hit the combat sword, and the force whistled out, forming a gust of wind that swept in all directions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone under the disciple’s feet exploded. He couldn’t stand still and knelt down. The stone on his knee exploded.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
