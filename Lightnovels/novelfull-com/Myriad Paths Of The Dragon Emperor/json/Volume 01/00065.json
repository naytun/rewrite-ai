This burly man had a cultivation of fifth grade master realm. Among the bandits, he was definitely at the leader level.</p><p>However, a fifth grade master realm was nothing in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>With a slight shake of his body, he dodged the axe. Then, with a flash of sword light, the burly man’s throat was cut off.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>The sword Qi was unparalleled. In the blink of an eye, dozens of people had died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>The other two of the three ghosts of Mount Yin and Xu Feiyun were in a similar situation. Apart from the chief, the strongest of the other bandits was only at the peak of the fifth grade master realm. They weren’t a match for the three ghosts.</p><p>Even if there were many people, it was useless.</p><p>In just a short moment, hundreds of people were killed.</p><p>not good, the enemy is too strong. Retreat!</p><p>The great master roared. He had exchanged over a hundred moves with the three Yin mountain ghosts, yet neither of them had won. He knew that he had kicked an iron plate today, so he prepared to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, a figure leaped out like a bolt of lightning from among the bandits and pounced towards the carriage of the Zhu clan’s eldest young miss.</p><p>This figure’s speed was unbelievably fast. With a wave of his hand, his true energy burst forth. He was actually even more powerful than the first master.</p><p>“Seventh grade master realm!”</p><p>The second brother of the yin mountain three ghosts shouted.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The strongest of the Zhu family’s guards was only in the first grade master realm, and it was impossible for them to contend against such an expert. More than ten of them were killed by the powerful true Qi.</p><p>The figure was about to pounce onto the carriage of the Zhu family’s eldest miss.</p><p>At this moment, the coachman, uncle Fu, let out a long howl.</p><p>“Zhou Linshan, I knew you would come.”</p><p>Following that, uncle Fu also leaped into the air, erupting with a powerful aura as he exchanged a few palm strikes with the figure from before.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a few consecutive booms, the two of them took a few steps back after landing.</p><p>this coachman is also a seventh grade master realm!</p><p>Lu Ming, Xu Feiyun, and the rest were all shocked.</p><p>At this time, everyone could clearly see that the figure who launched the sneak attack was an old man in his sixties.</p><p>“Zhu Bing, hand over the vitality supplement pill and Luan ‘er.”</p><p>Zhou Linshan shouted.</p><p>“Hand it over, then we’ll have to see if you have the ability to do so?”</p><p>The coachman said coldly. At this time, his body was no longer hunched. He stood straight and his aura was threatening.</p><p>Ta ta ta!</p><p>The sound of horse hooves rang out continuously. Following that, a large group of people appeared on the mountain path. There were also silhouettes of people flickering in the surrounding forest. There were a few hundred people in total.</p><p>“They’re all experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He could tell that the people who appeared behind them were not bandits. They were all elites, well-trained, and had strong cultivation.</p><p>The bandits ‘faces were extremely ugly. The chief shouted, ” “Everyone, your business has nothing to do with us. Can you let us leave?”</p><p>He even wanted to cry. He was simply baffled. Wasn’t it just a robbery? Not only did he encounter a bunch of experts, but now there was even a group of them.</p><p>Zhou Linshan waved his hand and said,”let them go!”</p><p>Immediately, those people opened up a path for the bandits to escape in panic.</p><p>After the bandits fled, seven old men walked up to Zhou Shanlin and saluted, ” “Master!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest moved their eyes and retreated to the side of the carriage.</p><p>“Zhou Linshan, it seems like the Zhou family has turned out in full force this time.”</p><p>The coachman laughed without a trace of fear.</p><p>“Zhu Bing, as the Zhu clan’s old ancestor, you actually played such a trick. Truly despicable and shameless.”</p><p>Zhou Linshan said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“What? The Zhu family’s ancestor? This coachman is actually the ancestor of the Zhu family?”</p><p>Three Yin ghosts, Xu Feiyun, and the others were shocked. They looked at the coachman, Zhu Bing, who was also the ancestor of the Zhu family, with a puzzled look.</p><p>But wasn’t the Zhu family’s ancestor severely injured and waiting for rescue at the dark blood Mountain?</p><p>Could it be that everything the Zhu family had said was false?</p><p>There was a glimmer of light in Lu Ming’s eyes. Indeed, something was not right. He had been feeling strange about it all along.</p><p>“Zhu Chuan, what’s going on?”</p><p>The leader of the yin mountain three ghosts looked at Zhu Chuan gloomily.</p><p>However, Zhu Chuan sneered and stood behind Zhu Bing.</p><p>everyone, it seems that you’ve been deceived by the Zhu family. Let me tell you the truth. The person in the carriage is my granddaughter, Zhou Tong. Her father was injured and needed a vitality supplement pill to treat him. She went to buy it, but she was caught by the Zhu family when she bought the vitality supplement pill.</p><p>everyone, this matter is a grudge between the Zhou family and the Zhu family. It has nothing to do with you. I hope you won’t interfere. No matter how much the Zhu family has given you, I’m willing to compensate you double.</p><p>Zhou Linshan cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Feiyun and the others were a little stunned. The truth was actually the complete opposite of what the Zhu family had said.</p><p>“Zhu Bing, Zhu Chuan, how dare you lie to us? we, the three ghosts of Yin mountain, are not that easy to fool.”</p><p>The leader of the three Yin mountain ghosts said coldly, his expression extremely unsightly.</p><p>It was the same for the others.</p><p>“Hehe, if I don’t do this, how can I lure out the Zhou family and make them come out in full force?”</p><p>Zhu Bing sneered.</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air came from the surrounding forest. Then, a group of people appeared and surrounded the Zhou family.</p><p>Zhu Bing, you indeed have an ambush in the dark. However, your Zhu clan and my Zhou clan are on par in strength. Do you think you can destroy my Zhou clan just like that? ”</p><p>Zhou Linshan said.</p><p>Zhu Bing laughed and said, ” of course, my Zhu family alone can’t destroy your Zhou family. However, with the addition of the few of them, as long as they die together with your Zhou family’s elders, will your Zhou family still be my match? ” Hahaha!”</p><p>“What? Zhu Bing, you actually want us to die together with the Zhou clan’s elder? I think you’re crazy! Now, give us the rest of the reward, and we’ll turn around and leave. I don’t want to get involved in the mess between your two families.”</p><p>The leader of the three Yin mountain ghosts looked at Zhu Bing as if he was a lunatic.</p><p>“That’s right, give me the rest of the silver and I can let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun’s expression was also extremely ugly.</p><p>He had actually been fooled by the Zhu family. He secretly decided that when he returned, he would definitely lead the Flying Cloud sect to teach the Zhu family a lesson.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He felt that things were not that simple.</p><p>“You want to leave after giving me silver? How can I exterminate the Zhou family if you leave?”</p><p>Zhu Bing sneered.</p><p>“Old Zhu, are you f * cking dreaming? Fine, you don’t want to give me the silver, right? I’ll leave now, but I’m afraid you can’t bear the anger of my Flying Cloud sect. ”</p><p>Xu Feiyun was furious. He turned around and wanted to leave.</p><p>“Leave, can you leave? Now that you’re poisoned, you’re dreaming if you think you can escape.”</p><p>Zhu Bing sneered.</p><p>Xu Yunfei’s body suddenly trembled. He turned around and looked at Zhu Bing in disbelief, ” “You guys, you actually dare to poison me?”</p><p>As for the three ghosts of Mount Yin, including the middle-aged woman, their expressions were extremely unsightly.</p><p>Only Lu Ming remained calm. There was even an inexplicable smile on his lips.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
