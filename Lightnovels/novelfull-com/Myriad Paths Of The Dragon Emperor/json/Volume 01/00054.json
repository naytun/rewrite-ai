The Qi cyclone in his Dantian started to revolve furiously as the spiritual energy of the world converged wildly upon his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a bottomless pit that frantically consumed spiritual energy.</p><p>...</p><p>Even Hua Chi and Pang Shi in the other two rooms were startled.</p><p>“This is Lu Ming’s cultivation level. Has he broken through? Why is there such a massive reaction? The speed at which spiritual energy is being devoured is even scarier than a Fifth Level blood meridian. Did Lu Ming’s blood meridian actually surpass the Fifth Level?” Hua Chi’s eyes widened in awe.</p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p><p>The commotion only died after a while.</p><p>In the room, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“The Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique is finally cultivated. What rich and condensed Essential Qi!” Lu Ming examined the surging compact Essential Qi in his body with an expression of ecstasy.</p><p>Currently, his Essential Qi was three times that of most people. Of course, “most people” in this context meant those who cultivated the Yellow Level techniques.</p><p>This was because the higher the level of a cultivated technique was, the more sorts of mystical abilities one would have. Then, the resulting Essential Qi cultivated from certain high-level techniques would be richer and denser.</p><p>Of course, that could not possibly reach an extent as fearsome as the True War Dragon Technique.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming got up and exited the room.</p><p>Having cultivated for ten days or so, he wanted to take a stroll outside and relax.</p><p>The moment he was out of his room, he saw that Hua Chi and Pang Shi were walking out too.</p><p>When Pang Shi noticed Lu Ming, he smiled and asked, “Senior Brother Lu, are you going for the lecture as well?”</p><p>“Lecture?” Lu Ming appeared blank.</p><p>“Yup, today an elder from the Vermillion Bird Hall is giving us a lecture, covering some information on cultivation as well as things to take note of. Senior Brother Lu, didn’t you know?” Pang Shi patted his own head.</p><p>“Cough cough!” Lu Ming gave a few awkward coughs. He truly did not know. These days, he had been busy cultivating and practically did not step out at all.</p><p>“Then, let’s go together!” Lu Ming said with a grin.</p><p>He had just finished his period of seclusion, so he could go and listen. Lu Ming had only begun properly cultivating for a few months. During this time, his cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds. On the other hand, he had neglected certain basics, so attending the lecture would surely benefit him.</p><p>Lu Ming and Pang Shi walked side by side while Hua Chi trailed behind with a stony expression.</p><p>The elder’s lecture was on the other side of Vermillion Bird Peak. There was a gigantic square in which cattail hassocks were arranged.</p><p>At that moment, there were already a few hundred people sitting on the hassocks in the square. They were all newly enrolled apprentices.</p><p>“Look, Lu Ming is here.”</p><p>“I’ve heard that after Lu Ming challenged Senior Brother Ning Feng, he went into seclusion. Now, he’s finally shown up.”</p><p>When the apprentices saw Lu Ming, they could not refrain from exchanging whispers.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered about them and found a hassock to sit down on.</p><p>As time passed, the audience grew. In the end, there were around five hundred people.</p><p>Initially, the Vermillion Bird Hall had a thousand newly enrolled apprentices or so. However, during the test, about 200 of them were killed, leaving only 800 behind.</p><p>There were also some who were in seclusion or otherwise occupied. This was common enough.</p><p>Just then, a figure came flitting elegantly over the square.</p><p>When Lu Ming noticed this figure, his eyes widened. “Mu Lan?”</p><p>The figure was Mu Lan whom he had not seen for a few months. She was wearing a tight, black dress in a unique style.</p><p>“So…so beautiful!”</p><p>As expected, there was a male apprentice beside Lu Ming who stared at Mu Lan with his mouth agape. He was practically drooling.</p><p>He was not the only one. The other male apprentices in the square acted similarly. They wore dazed, lewd expressions as they stared at Mu Lan above them.</p><p>Most of these apprentices were fifteen to sixteen-year-old youths, bursting with hormones. How could they resist Mu Lan’s charm?</p><p>“Hmph, you’re all depraved! Perverts!” All the female apprentices were annoyed as they snorted coldly.</p><p>“Alright, please be seated. Let me introduce myself. I’m Mu Lan, the elder who will be giving you a lecture today!” Mu Lan’s gaze circled around and paused upon Lu Ming.</p><p>By Lu Ming’s side, Pang Shi was astounded. “What? She’s the elder? How could she be so young?”</p><p>“Don’t you know anything? Let me tell you. Elder Mu Lan has outstanding talent and unparalleled beauty. She’s only 20 years old, yet her cultivation is immeasurably profound. She’s very likely to become the next Gold-robed apprentice.”</p><p>Behind them, Hua Chi curled his lips. Still, his eyes fixed upon Mu Lan in an incomparably fervent manner.</p><p>“Is she that incredible? Then, how did she become an elder?” Pang Shi asked curiously.</p><p>In the Mystical Sword Sect, true prodigies would not become elders. The roles of elders and attendants usually fell upon those who were older, or in other words, those whose potential had been exhausted.</p><p>Mu Lan’s current age was the prime of her cultivation. Furthermore, she had such exceptional talent. It was rare for someone like her to become an elder.</p><p>“I don’t know either. There aren’t many who would know why Elder Mu Lan suddenly chose to become an elder. Elder Mu Lan is my goddess. My goal is to become a preeminent expert and succeed wooing her.” Hua Chi wore the expression of a love-struck fool.</p><p>Above them, Mu Lan sat crossed-legged on a cattail hassock and said, “Alright, let’s begin the lecture. First of all, let’s talk about the Novice Realm…”</p><p>She started to discuss some details regarding the Novice Realm, explaining the aspects to pay attention to, as well as the purpose of this realm. Her lecture was very detailed and covered all areas.</p><p>After she finished speaking about the Novice Realm, she moved on to the Warrior Realm, then the Master Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming listened very closely. There were actually many things he had not noticed before, or simply had not understood.</p><p>After the lecture, he felt that he had learned a lot. Moreover, he was secretly stunned by the depths of Mu Lan’s learning and the keenness of her understanding.</p><p>The lecture lasted for two hours before Mu Lan stopped.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all for today. You may leave!” She waved her hand, then directed her gaze at Lu Ming and called out, “Lu Ming, stay behind!”</p><p>“Very well!” Lu Ming was slightly taken aback and quickly nodded.</p><p>Even so, Mu Lan’s words had caused another stir of whispers.</p><p>“Why did Elder Mu Lan ask Lu Ming to stay? Do they know each other?”</p><p>“Surely Elder Mu Lan hasn’t taken a fancy to Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Bah, how’s that possible? Elder Mu Lan is my goddess, so it’s definitely impossible!”</p><p>“Oh, how I envy Lu Ming! He gets to be alone with Elder Mu Lan. Ah, Elder Mu Lan is really drop-dead gorgeous. If I can marry her, I’ll be willing to give up ten years of my life.”</p><p>“Stop daydreaming!”</p><p>The apprentices all around stared at Lu Ming with envy, admiration, and resentment.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Mu Lan’s charm was truly too powerful.</p><p>“How could this be? Why would Elder Mu Lan ask Lu Ming alone to stay back? Lu Ming, you’d better behave honorably. Otherwise, I’ll have to deal with you!” Hua Chi glowered at Lu Ming in anguish, wishing desperately that it was he who got to stay behind.</p><p>Lu Ming scratched his nose somewhat speechlessly and went towards Mu Lan.</p><p>After a moment, everyone dispersed from the square, leaving only Mu Lan and Lu Ming behind.</p><p>Both of them sat facing each other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
