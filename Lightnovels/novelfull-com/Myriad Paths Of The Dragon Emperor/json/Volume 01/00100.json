He’s really overestimating himself. He really came to challenge the bronze platform.”</p><p>The red-robed youth beside Yao Tianyu shouted.</p><p>“He is indeed overestimating himself, but it’s just as well. We can send people to kill him. Senior brother Yao, what do you think?”</p><p>The other young man said coldly, then looked at Yao Tianyu.</p><p>Yao Tianyu looked at Lu Ming on the platform and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.”Sure!”</p><p>He had been looking for an opportunity to kill Lu Ming. Since Lu Ming had come up to the bronze platform on his own, he would not let this opportunity go.</p><p>In the stands in other directions, some geniuses on the bronze ranking also looked at Lu Ming with curious expressions.</p><p>On the bronze platform.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you really going to challenge the bronze platform?”</p><p>The middle-aged judge asked in surprise.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded again.</p><p>“Alright, since you’ve decided, I won’t stop you. Let the challenge begin.”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced in a straightforward manner.</p><p>At the side of the fighting ring, Feng xinglie cast a curious glance at Lu Ming. His eyes glimmered and he flew to the northern stands to watch with great interest.</p><p>At this moment, the judge had already made the announcement, and the entire venue quieted down instead. Everyone began to watch seriously.</p><p>The last newcomer King had just made it to the bronze rank, and now this year’s newcomer King was challenging him again. It was really interesting. This had never happened before in the history of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>How far could Lu Ming go?</p><p>Many people were curious.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me first?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and said in a clear voice.</p><p>The first five matches on the bronze stage were more casual, and anyone could go up and challenge them.</p><p>However, after five rounds, it would be necessary for people with the same winning streak to fight each other. Otherwise, it would not be able to show their strength at all.</p><p>The people below the ninth grade master realm fell silent.</p><p>Although they felt that Lu Ming could not win more than a few rounds, Lu Ming’s abilities were still there. A few months ago, he already had the combat strength of a ninth grade master.</p><p>“I’ll fight you.”</p><p>A figure quickly jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>it’s Duanmu Jinming from The White Tiger Hall. It’s said that his cultivation has already reached the mid-stage of the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>As soon as this person went up the stage, there were cries around him.</p><p>Duanmu Jinming was in his twenties. His face was pale and his eyes were malicious. He stared at Lu Ming and sneered.”Lu Ming, you really don’t know how to hold back. You actually came to challenge the bronze platform now. Haha, I’ll make you stop in the first round. The newcomer King is going to challenge the bronze platform and stop in the first round. This will definitely create a record in the mystical sword sect and will be remembered for centuries.”</p><p>Duanmu Jinming’s tone was filled with mockery and mockery.</p><p>“Your Duanmu family is indeed the first to come. However, I’ve discovered that your Duanmu family has a common trait. You have no skills at all, but you’re very good at boasting.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The Duanmu family members were furious.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, how dare you look down on my Duanmu family.”</p><p>“Duanmu Jinming, cripple him! Let him know the power of the Duanmu family!”</p><p>“Cripple him!”</p><p>……</p><p>Duanmu Jinming’s eyes were also extremely gloomy. He said coldly,”Lu Ming, you’ll pay a painful price for what you said.”</p><p>Duanmu Jinming unsheathed his long sword, and a white sword light shot out from it. It was extremely sharp.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a huge sword that was as wide as a palm and 1.5 meters long appeared in his hand.</p><p>Zheng had left this greatsword behind.</p><p>There was no need to use the fire-patterned gun to deal with such a small fry.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming wanted to test if he could exert the power of the lustrous sword technique with such a huge sword after his physical body had improved.</p><p>“Alright, I don’t need to say more about the rules. Let the battle begin.”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced.</p><p>“Hurry up, I don’t have that much time. There are still more than ten matches to go.”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>His tone was full of disdain, as if he didn’t take Duanmu Jinming seriously at all. He even said that there were more than ten matches to go, as if he could really win ten times in a row.</p><p>“Nest, you’re really arrogant.”</p><p>that’s right. He’s too arrogant. However, the more arrogant he is, the more embarrassed he will be when he is defeated later.</p><p>The surroundings were filled with discussions.</p><p>“Damn it, I’ll cripple you.”</p><p>Duanmu Jinming roared in anger. He moved and continued to charge toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fierce tiger sword technique!”</p><p>Duanmu Jinming let out a long howl and swung his combat sword. The illusionary image of a ferocious Tiger could be vaguely seen on the combat sword. It was extremely ferocious as it slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>a middle ninth grade master realm cultivator only has this much strength? ”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth twitched slightly and he swung his sword.</p><p>This strike was very direct. It was not a sword technique, but a casual slash. It was completely a brute force slash.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>This sword directly hit Duanmu Jinming’s combat sword. Then, everyone saw that Duanmu Jinming’s combat sword was bent and deformed, and the blade heavily hit Duanmu Jinming’s own chest.</p><p>Duanmu Jinming’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Duanmu Jinming’s body flew backward like a cannonball. He flew more than 20 meters and then slid more than 10 meters on the fighting ring before falling off.</p><p>The entire place suddenly fell into a deathly silence, and the atmosphere seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>Many people were even loudly criticizing Lu Ming’s arrogant words. However, at this moment, their expressions froze.</p><p>One sword. He had only used one sword. It was an ordinary sword, but Duanmu Jinming had been blown out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Wasn’t he too strong?</p><p>Wasn’t the difference too great?</p><p>“Alright, senior brother Lu Ming is the best.”</p><p>Pang Shi reacted and shouted in excitement.</p><p>At this moment, the others also reacted.</p><p>“This … Isn’t he too powerful? Finishing Duanmu Jinming with one move?”</p><p>indeed. It seems like I’ve underestimated Lu Ming. In my opinion, Lu Ming should be at the late stage of the ninth grade master realm, or even the peak of the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>“With this strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to win five times in a row.”</p><p>the newcomer King is the newcomer King. We’ve underestimated him.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned grave. Those who had belittled Lu Ming earlier felt their faces turn red.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to come up and fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at Duanmu Jinming, who had just left the fighting ring. He continued to look around.</p><p>“i’ll do it!”</p><p>Then, a young man jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, please guide me along.”</p><p>The young man was at the late ninth grade master realm, but he did not dare to look down on Lu Ming anymore. He cupped his fists and said politely.</p><p>“Sure, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This young man was using an iron rod, and when he waved it, it whistled through the air with extraordinary power.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly more polite to this young man. He used ten moves before he blasted him off the fighting ring.</p><p>Two consecutive wins.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
