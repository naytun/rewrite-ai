He thought to himself, ” no, Lu Ming will definitely be at a disadvantage if he goes like this. I heard that the star Moon Tower is backed by Yao Tianyu, a genius on the bronze ranking. No matter how strong Lu Ming is, he can’t be a match for him.</p><p>“I’m going to look for Feng Wu. I’ll ask her to look for elder Mu Lan. Otherwise, Lu Ming will be in danger,”</p><p>Hua Chi warned the others before hurriedly leaving.</p><p>…..</p><p>Speaking of the star Moon Tower, there was probably no one in the entire trading District who did not know of it. It was extremely famous.</p><p>This was because the star Moon Tower had the support of Yao Tianyu, a genius on the bronze ranking.</p><p>Therefore, the star Moon Tower’s strength was one of the top in the entire trading District.</p><p>This was because silver disciples would not interfere with such ordinary Trading Places.</p><p>They had a higher class venue.</p><p>The star Moon Tower was a three-story building that occupied a large area.</p><p>Liu Wei was a small leader in the star Moon Tower. He had joined the star Moon Tower for more than a year. Due to his quick-witted mind, good management skills, and ruthless methods, he had become a small leader in just over a year.</p><p>At this moment, he was lazily sitting on an armchair in front of the star Moon Tower’s main entrance and looking forward.</p><p>This was because there were still some people surrounding the front of the star Moon Tower. These people were the new disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>These people were the same as pang Shi and the others. They had all been scammed by the star Moon Tower.</p><p>At that moment, they were all glaring at Liu Wei, but they did not dare to say anything.</p><p>This was because they had just seen with their own eyes how one of the disciples had been beaten up by the members of the star Moon Alliance. He had almost been beaten to death.</p><p>Liu Wei held a cup of tea and sipped it slowly. Looking at the newbies below, who were angry but dared not say anything, he felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart.</p><p>damn it, my materials are worth three thousand taels of silver, and they only gave me three taels of silver. What’s the difference between this and robbery? ”</p><p>The disciples clenched their fists tightly and roared in their hearts.</p><p>“What are you all looking at? Asking for a beating, right? Hurry up and get lost.”</p><p>Liu Wei chided him from above.</p><p>“You … I’ll leave if you return the materials to me. ”</p><p>Finally, a thin teenager around the age of fifteen could not help but call out.</p><p>“Oh, you still dare to ask for the materials back? Are you dreaming? get this straight, we’ve already bought your materials, and we’ve already given you the silver. This is a fair trade, understand?”</p><p>Before Liu Wei could say anything, a Lackey with a big mouth jumped out next to him and shouted.</p><p>After scolding him, he sneaked a glance at Liu Wei and saw Liu Wei nodding his head secretly. He was overjoyed. It seemed that Liu Wei was very satisfied with his performance.</p><p>Below, the thin young man’s face was red. He clenched his fist and said, ” “Fair? My materials are worth more than five thousand taels of silver, and you’re only giving me five taels of silver. I risked my life to get them, you can’t do this.”</p><p>“Oh! You still dare to talk back? I think your bones are itching. Do you want to be like that big guy from before and have all your bones broken? our Alliance master personally dealt with that one, so it’ll be the same if I do it now.”</p><p>The minion with a big mouth sneered and walked down step by step.</p><p>The skinny young man gritted his teeth and shouted, ” “What you’re doing is against the sect’s rules. I’m going to lodge a complaint against you at the law enforcement Hall,”</p><p>“Oh, you still want to complain about us to the law enforcement Hall? I think your bones are really itching.”</p><p>The big-mouthed minion’s face was gloomy as he walked towards the thin youth.</p><p>The skinny boy’s face turned pale.</p><p>The other new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples gritted their teeth, but none of them dared to say a word.</p><p>In the distance, many disciples from other courtyards were watching the show. They were all very interested as if they were watching a good show.</p><p>“Don’t come over.”</p><p>The skinny youth roared and struck out with his palm.</p><p>However, he was only in the ninth grade warrior realm, while the big-mouthed Lackey was an old disciple who had already reached the third grade master realm. He was no match for him.</p><p>With one move, the skinny young man was hit and spat out blood. He retreated continuously, but the big-mouthed minion quickly caught up and grabbed the skinny young man’s neck.</p><p>“You still dare to attack? You’re looking for a beating!”</p><p>The big-mouthed minion shouted coldly, then raised his other hand high and slapped the thin youth’s face.</p><p>“He’s in trouble!”</p><p>The new Vermillion Bird Hall disciple sighed and closed his eyes.</p><p>However, the expected slap didn’t sound out. The crowd fell into silence.</p><p>They opened their eyes in curiosity and saw that the big-mouthed Lackey’s arm was being held by someone.</p><p>It was a youth of about fifteen years old, about the same age as them, but he was dressed in a blue robe and had a slender figure. Just by standing there, he gave off the feeling of being as unmoving as a mountain.</p><p>The thin teenager was prepared to be beaten up, but he suddenly realized that the big-mouthed minion’s arm was held by someone.</p><p>He turned his head and saw a delicate and pretty face. However, this face was extremely cold.</p><p>“Lu … Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>The thin teenager could not help but think.</p><p>“Who are you? You dare to block me, are you looking for death?”</p><p>The minion with the big mouth shouted.</p><p>“Me? She’s just a new disciple of the Vermillion Bird Hall.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“A new disciple of the Vermillion Bird Hall?”</p><p>When he heard that Lu Ming was just a new disciple of the Vermillion Bird Hall, the big-mouthed Lackey’s courage was boosted. He shouted,”You’re just a new disciple, and you dare to grab my hand? If you don’t let go, then kneel down and admit your mistake, I might spare you.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”Trash like you, what are you still doing here?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming exerted force in his palm.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bone bones cracking was heard.</p><p>Then, there was the shrill scream of the big-mouthed minion.</p><p>“My hand, my hand is broken, let go of my hand!”</p><p>The big-mouthed minion cried out in pain. He loosened his grip on the skinny teenager and desperately tried to break Lu Ming’s arm.</p><p>“I can let you go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he raised his arm high and slapped it down hard.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>It was an extremely loud slap.</p><p>With the sound of the slap, the big-mouthed young man’s body was like a broken garbage bag being rolled up by the wind. He flew out with a whoosh, sticking to the ground.</p><p>Everyone could also see that as he flew out, teeth mixed with blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>The big-mouthed face collapsed and deformed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The big-mouthed minion fell heavily on the wall beside the stairs. He screamed and fainted.</p><p>Cool! It felt so good!</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Hall’s new apprentices roared in their hearts.</p><p>This slap was simply too satisfying, too satisfying.</p><p>The big-mouthed minions were arrogant and despotic just now, but now they were slapped so badly. It was so satisfying, so satisfying that it seeped into their bones. They wished that they could transform into Lu Ming and give the big-mouthed young man a few tight slaps.</p><p>At that moment, Liu Wei and the other members of the star Moon Alliance, who were standing at the entrance of the star Moon Tower, had their faces turn gloomy.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
