With a sword cry, he unsheathed his sword.</p><p>Not many people clearly saw how he pulled out the sword. Most people only heard the sound of the sword, and then saw a white sword light flash in the air.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the dense sword Qi that sun Guang had slashed out disappear without a trace. Then, sun Guang grunted and his body flew far away, falling on the fighting ring.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Many people looked at each other, not knowing what had happened, because it had happened too quickly.</p><p>Many people only saw sun Guang launch an attack, and then saw a flash of sword light, and sun Guang flew out.</p><p>“This … What was happening? Did sun Guang lose?”</p><p>On the side, pang Shi was tongue-tied.</p><p>Hua Chi was also puzzled.</p><p>that’s right, sun Guang lost. He was defeated by Feng xinglie with one strike. Look at sun Guang’s chest, there’s a wound.</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>The person beside Lu Ming quickly looked over. Indeed, he saw a deep sword wound on sun Guang’s chest. Blood was flowing out continuously.</p><p>Others might not have seen it clearly, but Lu Ming saw it clearly. Just now, Feng xinglie pulled out his sword and attacked. With one strike, he destroyed all of sun Guang’s attacks and left a wound on sun Guang’s chest.</p><p>“What a fast sword, and what a powerful attack.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he was somewhat amazed.</p><p>He concluded that the sword technique that Feng xinglie used was definitely a black grade martial skill.</p><p>In the fighting ring, sun Guang struggled to get up. His face was still filled with shock. He cupped his fists and said, ” “I’ve lost. Thank you for showing mercy, Junior Brother Feng.”</p><p>He knew that if Feng xinglie didn’t retract a part of his power, he would have been dead.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!” Feng xinglie cupped his fists.</p><p>Sun Guang did not say anything more. He turned around and left the fighting ring, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>If he was defeated, his past achievements would be cancelled and he would have to accumulate them again.</p><p>The middle-aged judge stepped forward and announced, ” Feng xinglie is the winner of this battle. He’s on the bronze list.</p><p>Following the referee’s announcement, the entire venue erupted into an uproar.</p><p>he did it. Feng fenglie did it. As a new disciple in the last two years, he was the first one to make it to the bronze rank. He’s the representative of all the new disciples in the last two years.</p><p>amazing! Feng xinglie is so amazing! He has entered the bronze rank in less than two years. He is indeed the king of the new disciples. Other than him, the others who have entered the sect in the past two years will need at least half a year to enter the bronze rank.</p><p>“That’s right, the previous new generation King, Feng xinglie is considered extremely powerful.”</p><p>do you guys think he’ll continue to challenge? ”</p><p>I really hope he continues to challenge. Did you see that more than half of the geniuses ranked below 30th on the bronze rank are here? ”</p><p>Gasps of admiration could be heard all around. Pang Shi, who was standing beside Lu Ming, was also very excited.</p><p>one day, I’ll also be on the bronze list!</p><p>Hua Chi clenched his fists and said confidently.</p><p>love-struck fool, I believe you can do it. Both you and senior brother Lu will be fine. I don’t know if I will have a chance in this life.</p><p>Pang Shi said longingly.</p><p>Lu Ming patted pang Shi’s shoulder and said with a smile, ” “Big rock, you’re working so hard. You can definitely do it.”</p><p>When pang Shi had first joined the sect, he had been in the ninth grade warrior realm. After half a year of cultivation, he had broken through to the peak of the first grade master realm.</p><p>Although his cultivation speed was not fast, he took it one step at a time and his Foundation was very solid.</p><p>Fengxing lie, you are now ranked 57th on the bronze list. You are qualified to challenge the geniuses on the bronze list. Do you still want to challenge them? ” the middle-aged judge asked.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on Feng xinglie. They were all very curious. Would he continue to challenge?</p><p>Feng xinglie didn’t reply. He seemed to be thinking.</p><p>“Who do you think Feng xinglie will challenge if he continues?”</p><p>it’s hard to say, but he’ll definitely challenge those who are ranked 45th and above on the bronze rank, because they’re in the same class.</p><p>that’s right. If he wants to fight today, he can only challenge the geniuses on the bronze list. Look, Duanmu Hu who is ranked 55th, Yao Tianyu who is ranked 51st, Yan Xu who is ranked 50th, and Ji Dong who is ranked 48th are all here. He is most likely to challenge them.</p><p>Sounds of discussion and speculation rang out in the surroundings.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted. He followed the others ‘gazes and saw Yao Tianyu on the eastern grandstand.</p><p>Yao Tianyu crossed his arms and sat there calmly.</p><p>Beside him, there were more than a dozen minions.</p><p>He tie, the red-robed youth, and the others were all familiar faces.</p><p>“Senior brother Yao, do you think Feng xinglie will challenge you?”</p><p>A young man asked.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu replied indifferently.</p><p>“Then, if Feng xinglie challenges you, are you confident?”</p><p>The young man asked again.</p><p>“Although Feng xinglie’s sword of essence restoring is powerful, it’s not enough to challenge me!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu replied confidently.</p><p>“That’s for sure. How can this Feng xinglie be a match for senior brother Yao? if he overestimates himself and challenges senior brother Yao, he’s just looking for trouble.”</p><p>The red-robed young man immediately began to flatter him.</p><p>Yao Tianyu smiled as he looked down at the fighting ring.</p><p>……</p><p>On the fighting ring, Feng xinglie pondered for a while and replied, ” “I choose to continue the challenge.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the atmosphere in the hall exploded. Everyone stared at Feng xinglie, waiting to see who he would challenge.</p><p>Feng fenglie’s eyes scanned the stands and then landed on the west side.</p><p>“Duanmu Hu, come down and fight!”</p><p>Feng xinglie said loudly.</p><p>On the west side of the stands, a burly young man stood up with a gloomy expression,”Feng xinglie, are you sure you want to challenge me?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Feng xinglie said.</p><p>“Haha, good. Feng xinglie, I will make you regret your choice!”</p><p>Duanmu Hu laughed in anger.</p><p>It was not a glorious thing to be challenged by someone who had just entered the bronze rank. On the contrary, it was an embarrassing thing.</p><p>It was simple. Being challenged meant that you were weak and looked down on.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>Duanmu Hu jumped down from the stands. With a few leaps, he crossed a distance of more than 100 meters and arrived on the fighting ring.</p><p>The speed of his movement technique was no weaker than sun Guang’s.</p><p>The two of them stood facing each other.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Feng fenglie to challenge Duanmu Hu. This is going to be interesting.”</p><p>Said an old disciple in his twenties not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh? How is it interesting?”</p><p>The others asked.</p><p>Even Lu Ming, pang Shi, and the others looked at him.</p><p>The senior disciple felt proud that he had attracted so many people all of a sudden.</p><p>Letting out a dry cough, he said, ” you guys should have seen it just now. Feng xinglie’s sword technique is extremely fast, and the power that burst out in an instant is extremely powerful. This sword technique is a black grade low level martial skill, ” origin sword “.</p><p>this sword technique is extremely powerful, but it has a weakness. It consumes a lot of true Qi. If I can’t defeat the enemy with one strike, I’ll be in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in his heart. This sword of returning to origin was quite similar to the ‘explosion’ of the fire gun technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
