The life essence contained in the blood essence is even denser than the demonic beasts outside?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Then, they continued to move forward. Along the way, they encountered many demonic beasts, all of which were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>As expected, the demonic beasts here, regardless of their species, contained a much richer essence.</p><p>However, most of them were Class 1 or Class 2 demonic beasts.</p><p>A small number of them had only reached the fourth or fifth grade of the second level. The improvement Lu Ming could make was very limited.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming hunted demonic beasts in the dark blood Mountain while searching for the blood Reiki flower.</p><p>However, three days had passed and Lu Ming did not even find a single blood Reiki flower.</p><p>The efficiency was really bad. As for the dark blood Stone that Lu Ming needed the most, there was no trace of it.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to continue searching and treat it as cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed. In total, Lu Ming had been in the dark blood Mountain for ten days.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally found a blood Reiki flower.</p><p>On the other hand, his cultivation had already reached the fifth grade master realm advanced stage, and he wasn’t far from reaching the pinnacle.</p><p>Hiss … Hiss …</p><p>A dark red python slithered quickly with Lu Ming hot on its heels.</p><p>This giant python was a demonic beast at the peak of sixth grade second level. It was rare to encounter such a high-level demonic beast in the dark blood Mountain, so Lu Ming did not want to let it go.</p><p>However, the giant python was extremely fast. With a twist of its body, it covered a distance of tens of meters. Lu Ming could not catch up to it in a short time even with his Dragon serpent steps.</p><p>The snake and the human kept running forward.</p><p>Before he knew it, he had run for dozens of miles and arrived at a dense forest.</p><p>At this time, the giant Python’s speed gradually slowed down.</p><p>“Let’s see where you can run to now.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and the sword gleam slashed at the giant python.</p><p>Sisi!</p><p>The giant python hissed and spat out wisps of poisonous gas at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged it in a flash. Then, he took a step forward and rushed toward the Python. A sword light flashed and left a long wound on the Python’s body. Fresh blood flowed out.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He felt a burning pain on his skin, as if he was being corroded by something.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>I clearly avoided the Python’s poisonous gas. How did this happen? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings. At this moment, he realized that there was a faint dark red blood aura in the air. If one did not pay attention, one would not be able to tell.</p><p>“Could it be that this blood Qi is poisonous?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He immediately circulated his essential Qi and spread it throughout his body to resist the blood Qi.</p><p>??…</p><p>When the blood Qi collided with the genuine Qi, it actually made a sizzling sound, as if it was corroding the genuine Qi.</p><p>What a powerful poisonous gas.</p><p>At this moment, the giant python was dragging its injured body and slithering forward.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and cut off the giant Python’s head.</p><p>Then, with a thought, the small snake-like bloodline appeared and opened its mouth. Nine drops of blood essence flew out of the giant Python’s body and were swallowed by the small snake.</p><p>However, it was not over yet. The small snake opened its mouth again and sucked in the red blood Qi beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, a sizzling sound could be heard as if the blood Qi was being refined.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. This worked too?</p><p>However, in this way, there was no blood Qi around Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The feeling of corrosion on his skin had also disappeared.</p><p>“That’s good too. I can see what this place is.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>He continued to move forward. The further he went, the thicker the red blood Qi became. However, the small snake kept absorbing it. There was always a vacuum around Lu Ming’s body that prevented the blood Qi from entering.</p><p>When this blood Qi was devoured and refined by the spirit-devouring bloodline, it would also be transformed into wisps of energy. However, this energy was not very strong and was not of much use to the improvement of cultivation.</p><p>After walking for a few thousand meters, he smelled a faint scent of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. After walking another hundred meters, a pool of water appeared in front of him.</p><p>The pool wasn’t big, about ten meters in length and width. However, it wasn’t water in the pool, but a dark red liquid.</p><p>The pool was filled with a dark red liquid that looked like blood. The faint smell of blood was obviously coming from the pool.</p><p>The blood Qi in the air was also emitted from this pool.</p><p>By the side of the pool, there were many small red flowers.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed at the sight of the flowers.</p><p>blood Reiki flowers, these are all blood Reiki flowers. Hahaha, I’ve really worn out my iron shoes and searched high and low for them, but I found them without any effort.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming walked to the side of the pond and picked the fruits carefully.</p><p>The liquid in the pool was obviously poisonous. Lu Ming did not want to come into contact with it.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming had picked all the blood spirit flowers by the pond. There were a total of fifty-four of them. In addition to the one he had found earlier, there were fifty-five of them.</p><p>This was a huge harvest.</p><p>One herb was 100 contribution points, so 55 of them would be 5500 contribution points.</p><p>After picking them, Lu Ming looked at the liquid in the pool.</p><p>Although the liquid was highly toxic, it obviously contained a powerful energy essence. Otherwise, it would not have been able to produce so many blood Reiki flowers.</p><p>“Can the spirit-devouring bloodline devour and refine this liquid?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>“Let’s try devouring a drop first.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>It was impossible to improve his cultivation quickly and walk the path of a martial arts powerhouse without taking some risks.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately circulated his essential Qi and scooped up a drop of red liquid. He then controlled his Blood Meridian and swallowed the drop of liquid.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be able to feel a sizzling sound in his blood vessels. Then, a wave of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“It really works!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming sat cross-legged by the pool and controlled his spirit-devouring bloodline to devour and refine the liquid.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not dare to devour too much at once. He would only devour them in small amounts.</p><p>It was true that the spirit-devouring bloodline devoured and refined this liquid much slower than the blood essence of demonic beasts. However, it was still many times faster than directly absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth for cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level began to increase rapidly again.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had reached the peak of the fifth grade master realm.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming broke through in one go and reached the sixth grade master realm. It was not over yet. Lu Ming continued to cultivate.</p><p>He cultivated for more than twenty days. In total, Lu Ming had been cultivating here for a month.</p><p>In a month’s time, all the liquid in the pool had been devoured and refined by Lu Ming, leaving only a pit. Lu Ming’s cultivation had also reached the early seventh grade master realm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
