She looked absolutely beautiful and charming.</p><p>She appeared graceful and pleasant and was certainly born to be a beauty.</p><p>“What’s the good news?” Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>“Young Master, you’ve only been focusing on your cultivation, without ever bothering to check on me. Allow me to tell you that I’ve opened up four meridians!”</p><p>1</p><p>Qiu Yue leaned towards Lu Ming’s ear and murmured. A faint fragrance wafted into Lu Ming’s nose. It was a pleasant smell.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in the right mood to enjoy it. His eyes nearly popped out as he spat a mouthful of tea. He looked at Qiu Yue incredulously and asked, “Qiu Yue, what did you say? You’ve already opened up four meridians?”</p><p>“Yep. Is it that weird, Young Master? It didn’t take much effort for the meridians to open up,” Qiu Yue asked curiously as she blinked her eyes.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips started to tremble ever so slightly.</p><p>He clearly remembered when Qiu Yue was nursing her health around ten days ago. It was only three days before Lu Ming passed the Qi Condensation Art down to Qiu Yue, and taught her how to open her meridians.</p><p>It had only been three days, but Qiu Yue had already opened up four meridians. Her blood meridian was not awakened yet, and she was even using the useless Qi Condensation Art. It was truly inconceivable!</p><p>4</p><p>Moreover, what did “it didn’t take much effort” even mean? Was she trying to drive him mad?</p><p>Was it possible that Qiu Yue was actually a prodigy in cultivating martial arts? Lu Ming’s heart started to burn.</p><p>“It was nothing. Can you feel the energy from your blood meridian, Qiu Yue?” Lu Ming coughed and asked.</p><p>“The power of my blood meridian… I can’t feel it. I wonder why?”</p><p>Qiu Yue was a little confused herself.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. “Qiu Yue, come to my room, I’ll check it out for you,” he said.</p><p>“Mm, sure!” Qiu Yue nodded.</p><p>The two of them entered Lu Ming’s room and sat on the bed.</p><p>“Alright, let’s start.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as he stretched out his palms and placed it on Qiu Yue’s back, then gradually infused Essential Qi into her spine.</p><p>He slowly shifted his palm up Qiu Yue’s back in order to stimulate her blood meridian and check its condition.</p><p>It was at this moment that Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt a huge resistance in Qiu Yue’s spine that was stopping him from circulating his Essential Qi.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and increased the amount of Essential Qi being infused.</p><p>Something strange occurred right at that moment.</p><p>A blinding flash of blood-red suddenly burst from Qiu Yue’s spine. A strong force came surging out from her spine, shooting towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was unable to resist this force. With a thunderous boom, he was thrown to the wall by the force.</p><p>At that instant, the red flash from Qiu Yue’s spine disappeared as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>“Young Master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue was startled, she quickly got off the bed and went to lift Lu Ming up.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up. Except for his bubbling Qi and blood, he was fine.</p><p>Although the force that surged from her spine was strong, it was not fatal.</p><p>“As long as you’re fine, Young Master. You almost scared me to death!” Qiu Yue said as she gave herself a pat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows. He was sure that there was a blood meridian present in Qiu Yue, but it was unusual that it would generate a surge of power to blast him away; definitely unheard of.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming furrowing his eyebrows, she knew that he was fretting over her blood meridian. “Young Master, if I’m unable to awaken my blood meridian, so be it. Ah, right, I’ll prepare food for you and the Lady,” Qiu Yue said gently.</p><p>Qiu Yue opened the door and left after she finished talking.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while after Qiu Yue left. He had no choice but to push it aside as he could not figure it out. He could only read up on some ancient journals to check if there were similar records when he had the time.</p><p>1</p><p>He returned to his room after the meal and returned to the Supreme Shrine once again.</p><p>There were only two days left before the House Meeting. Lu Ming planned to consume the Spirit Soul Pill to make the final push.</p><p>The Spirit Soul Pill was a Third Level medicine pill. It was impossible for a normal person to completely refine it as all medicine contained poison and impurities. It would take time to refine the toxin within one’s body. However, it was not a problem for Lu Ming.</p><p>He started circulating the True War Dragon Technique after consuming the Spirit Soul Pill.</p><p>A strong gravitation from his spine absorbed the Spirit Soul Pill’s effects and refined energy gushed out.</p><p>The Qi cyclone in his dantian started turning rapidly and absorbed the energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was increasing rapidly.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The House Meeting had finally come.</p><p>“Lu Yao, First Branch Elder, I will shock all of you.”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped cultivating and opened his eyes. He felt the Essential Qi surging within his body as he sneered ever so slightly.</p><p>He left the Supreme Shrine and headed towards the courtyard.</p><p>“Eh? Why aren’t Mother and Qiu Yue around?”</p><p>He looked around and realized Li Ping and Qiu Yue were not there.</p><p>It was impossible. Today was the House Meeting, Li Ping and Qiu Yue would definitely have been waiting for him there.</p><p>“Hurry up! Wash quickly! Clean the toilet too after you finished washing all these clothes!”</p><p>At that moment, a sharp sound that sounded like a duck sounded from next door.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current residence was originally for servants. Hence, it was natural that the next room was where servants lived and worked.</p><p>“You guys are stepping over the line! It’s one thing for you to make us wash clothes, but for you to ask to clean the toilets! My Lady is the spouse of the Lord! This is too much, I’m reporting you guys to the Elder Council!”</p><p>At that moment, a yell rang out.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The yell sounded like a thunder crash right next to Lu Ming’s ears. His eyes instantly went red as anger shot to the top of his head.</p><p>As the scream was from Qiu Yue, then the Lady that she referred to must have been his mother, Li Ping.</p><p>These servants dared to make Li Ping and Qiu Yue wash their clothes, and to make it worse, clean the toilet! They deserved to die!</p><p>Lu Ming twisted his body and rushed towards the next door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
