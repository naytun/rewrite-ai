He looked like a man made of blood.</p><p>Hua Chi, in particular, had a complicated look in his eyes besides shock. He was touched and admired.</p><p>“By the way, how’s Pang Shi?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with some worry.</p><p>he’s fine. The Alchemist has already set his bones back and fed him some healing pills. He should be fine.</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Suddenly, his body swayed and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and Hua Chi were all shocked.</p><p>“It seems that I have to recuperate on the spot,” Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique to begin healing.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Hua Chi growled.</p><p>Lu Ming could not even go back to recuperate, which showed the severity of his injuries.</p><p>After that, Hua Chi, Feng Wu, and Mu Lan all stood close to Lu Ming to protect him.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers watched for a while before leaving.</p><p>The news of this battle spread like wildfire throughout the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>After hearing this news, everyone had different reactions.</p><p>Some people scoffed and thought that Lu Ming was a reckless man who did things impulsively and did not care about the consequences. It was unwise to fight even though he knew that he was no match.</p><p>However, some people were full of praise for Lu Ming. They felt that Lu Ming was loyal, had a firm path of martial arts, and had an indomitable will to advance bravely.</p><p>On the path of martial arts, one should be fearless and attack when needed. If one had to look around, even be afraid of the slightest thing, and swallow one’s anger, then what was the point of practicing martial arts and cultivation?</p><p>Anyway, there were all kinds of theories.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was unaware of this. He was fully focused on healing his injuries.</p><p>The healing process took six hours.</p><p>When Lu Ming opened his eyes, it was already evening.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you feeling better?”</p><p>Mu Lan was the first to notice that Lu Ming had woken up. She asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Much better!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After 12 hours of healing, his injuries had basically stabilized. As long as he could hold on for a while, he would be completely healed.</p><p>Feng Wu and Hua Chi hurried to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with warmth. He knew that while he was recuperating, the few of them had been by his side.</p><p>However, there was a skinny youth who didn’t leave either. He was watching from a distance.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, he walked to the skinny youth and asked, ” “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Lu … Senior brother Lu, I’m Li Yi.”</p><p>The skinny youth said excitedly.</p><p>“Li Yi! Thank you for this.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“No, no, senior brother Lu Ming, I should be the one thanking you.”</p><p>Li Yi said hurriedly.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the Vermillion Bird Hall together!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The few of them headed toward the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest had returned to the dormitory.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned, he did not return to his room. Instead, he walked into pang Shi’s room.</p><p>Pang Shi was lying on the bed, his entire body wrapped in bandages. His legs and arms were also in casts.</p><p>At this moment, pang Shi had already woken up. When he saw Lu Ming entering, he struggled to get up and shouted, ” “Senior brother Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>“Don’t move, just lie down and rest!”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly stopped pang Shi from moving and smiled. “Don’t worry, I’m fine!”</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault that you’re so badly injured.”</p><p>Pang Shi said with tears in his eyes.</p><p>He had heard about Lu Ming’s battle.</p><p>After all, it had been more than six hours.</p><p>“I should be the one saying sorry. Yao Tianyu and the others” target is me, but they implicated you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, no, it’s not senior Lu Ming’s fault. It’s all my fault for being too weak. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have implicated you, senior Lu Ming.”</p><p>Pang Shi said. His eyes were filled with self-blame and determination.</p><p>“Alright, big rock, don’t think too much. Have a good rest.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and patted pang Shi. He then walked out of pang Shi’s room.</p><p>After returning to his room, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“The armor of the red-scaled snake is so broken.”</p><p>He took off all his clothes and looked at the tattered red-scaled snake armor in his hands. Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>This time, if he didn’t have the red-scaled snake armor as a layer of protection, he would have been more seriously injured.</p><p>After changing into a new set of clothes, Lu Ming went out to fetch some water to wash his body clean. He then returned to the Supreme shrine and continued to channel his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>Time flew by, and seven days quickly passed.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming practiced a set of fist techniques in the courtyard and exercised his muscles and bones.</p><p>after seven days, my injuries have healed.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and thought to himself. His eyes flashed with joy.</p><p>He realized that the true Qi cultivated from the true war Dragon technique was not only rich and condensed, but it also had a very good healing effect.</p><p>An ordinary person would need at least a month to recover from such an injury. However, he only used seven days.</p><p>A God-grade cultivation technique was indeed very useful.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>Just then, the door was pushed open and Feng Wu walked in.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s your recovery? I’ve brought you some medicinal wine, do you want to try it?”</p><p>Feng Wu smiled brightly.</p><p>“I’ve already recovered.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The smile froze on Feng Wu’s face. She looked at Lu Ming as if he was a monster. “It’s only been seven days, and you’ve already recovered?”</p><p>“Yeah, what’s so strange about that? Don’t you know that I’m a genius?”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and it cut through the air with a loud whistling sound. He then looked at Feng Wu with a smug face.</p><p>“Genius? How can a genius be beaten up like this?”</p><p>Feng Wu pursed her lips in disdain, but there was still shock in her eyes.</p><p>He recovered in seven days, what a monster.</p><p>“By the way, Feng Wu, can you tell me more about the bronze list? How strong are the geniuses on the bronze list?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The bronze ranking? He’s very strong!”</p><p>Feng Wu’s face turned grim at the mention of the bronze list. as you know, you have to win ten matches in a row on the bronze platform before you can be ranked on the bronze list. It’s not easy to win ten matches in a row. The higher you go, the more difficult it will be.</p><p>for example, after you win eight matches in a row, you will have to face an opponent who has also won eight matches in a row in the ninth match. After winning nine matches in a row, you will have to face an opponent who has also won nine matches in a row. Therefore, it is really difficult to win ten matches in a row.</p><p>that’s why the geniuses on the bronze list are all extremely powerful. They can defeat Warriors of the same level with one move as easily as eating and drinking. I heard that most of the geniuses on the bronze list have successfully cultivated at least one black level low-rank martial technique.</p><p>“Even if they didn’t successfully cultivate a black level martial arts technique, they would have mastered some secret technique, and some might even have cultivated the path of body refinement.”</p><p>Feng Wu explained in detail.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
