Shatter his mouth!” Lu Bing howled furiously.</p><p>“Yes, Young Master Bing!”</p><p>The two men behind Lu Bing were young and fit, around sixteen years of age, and like Lu Bing, were from the Fifth Branch.</p><p>As they draw nearer to Lu Ming, one of them jeered, “Lu Ming, do you still think that you’re the heir of the Blood Meridian of the Lu Family? the young master of the Lu’s? You’re nothing but a piece of trash, trash that’s not even fit enough to be considered a servant. We’ll help wake you up so you can see yourself clearly. You cannot afford to bark up the wrong tree.”</p><p>“Young Master!” Qiu Yue’s petite face whitened with fear, holding Lu Ming’s sleeves tightly in her hands.</p><p>“Fear not, nothing but two dogs and you think your young master wouldn’t be able to handle it?” answered Lu Ming with a smile as he nuzzled Qiu Yue’s head.</p><p>Without a doubt, the two young men heard these words too.</p><p>There and then…</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>“You want to die?”</p><p>The two of them roared and leaped towards Lu Ming, with their punches aimed towards Lu Ming’s face with such force it carried a whistle like the wind.</p><p>They may be Ordinary Martial Artists, but one of them had unlocked seven meridians, and the other, eight. As they joined forces, it was enough to be a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>The two men, along with Lu Bing, had a smirk on their faces, as though they could already see Lu Ming’s face bruised and swollen like a pig’s head.</p><p>“Piss back to where you came from!”</p><p>Right before the punches landed, Lu Ming bellowed and he delivered a slap.</p><p>That slap was as fast as lightning, and before they knew it, “Pa Pa”, two cries were heard as two silhouettes, along with a bunch of teeth and blood, flew a distance and crashed heavily on the ground.</p><p>“My face, my teeth!” The two men wailed as they were on the ground, with cheeks that swelled as high as a building, teeth from their mouth half missing , and blood flowing out non-stop.</p><p>Lu Bing was stunned and looked at Lu Ming, flabbergasted.</p><p>Lu Ming, that trash, defeated his mighty men with a slap? How was that possible?</p><p>“Lu Bing, you would not stop calling me trash, and you threatened to destroy my mouth. Now, two of your dogs are done with their mouth redecoration, you’re up next,” said Lu Ming icily as he stared at Li Bing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I don’t know what type of blind luck you have in obtaining some treasures and gifts, enabling you to cultivate with such progress. But surely you don’t think that since you’ve defeated these two pieces of trash, you’ll have a chance against me? How naive, I AM a Blood Meridian Martial Artist.”</p><p>Lu Bing took a deep breath to calm himself down.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming was able to cultivate? Lu Ming was nothing but an Ordinary Martial Artist who cannot awaken their blood meridians, while he was a Blood Meridian Martial Artist with an awakened Second Level blood meridian.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now I shall show you what it means to be a Blood Meridian Martial Artist.”</p><p>Lu Bing let out a roar and behind him, red lights flashed and instantly a majestic, gigantic wolf as red as fire appeared above his head.</p><p>“Flaming Wolf Fist!”</p><p>Lu Bing took a step forward as he howled, and pounced towards Lu Ming like a wolf.</p><p>“Peak of top Novice Realm, Second Level blood meridian? I’d like to see how strong it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed brightly.</p><p>On his toes, Lu Ming twisted his torso and used the Flaming Dragon Fist.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lu Ming’s and Lu Bing’s fists collided.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>After the commotion, the sound of bones snapping could be heard clearly.</p><p>Right after, Lu Bing flew backward at a speed faster than he came and fell heavily to the ground, clutching his right arm and yelling in pain.</p><p>“Is this all a Blood Meridian Martial Artist is capable of?”</p><p>Lu Ming smirked in disdain, and inched towards Lu Bing with an icy gaze.</p><p>Lu Bing was horrified. As he was squirming backward he yelled, “What do you want, Lu Ming? Don’t fool around, I warn you!”</p><p>“Nothing much, just robbing you. Now, give me all the valuable things you have on you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed as he said it.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!” howled Lu Bing.</p><p>“Oh, if that’s the case, I have no choice but to ruin your mouth then,” taunted Lu Ming as he raised his foot, about to stomp on Lu Bing’s face.</p><p>Seeing how Lu Ming was not joking, Lu Bing was finally afraid. He yelled, “wait, I will, I’ll give you all my valuables.”</p><p>Honestly, Lu Bing had quite a lot of money on him. He totaled up about three thousand taels and painfully gave it up to Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s it?!”</p><p>Lu Ming sulked and kept the money with a look of distaste.</p><p>Lu Bing nearly vomited blood upon hearing it. Three thousand taels and Lu Ming thought it was little? As a descendent of the Lu Family, it was quite an achievement to have three thousand taels with him.</p><p>“I’ll let you go this time, but if there’s a next time, it’s not something a few taels of silver can settle.” Lu Ming glared coldly and left Lu BIng with those words, bringing a stunned Qiu Yue with him.</p><p>Lu Bing was, after all, the son of the Fifth Branch leader, and if Lu Ming truly did something to him, the Fifth Branch leader would not let it go.</p><p>Lu Ming was unafraid, but he could not help but to think of Li Ping and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Damn it, Young Master Bing, that little Lu Ming was so arrogant! Let’s go back and tell the branch leader, and ask him to give Lu Ming a lesson.”</p><p>One of the young men, who was missing a few teeth, hobbled to Lu Bing’s side and heatedly suggested.</p><p>“You idiot, isn’t this humiliating enough? If anyone else were to know that I was defeated by Lu Ming the trash, would I still have my reputation? I warn you two, what happened here today stays here,” chided Lu Bing.</p><p>“Yes, yes, Young Master Bing, we won’t say a word. The two men nodded furiously.</p><p>“Huff!”</p><p>Lu Bing huffed indifferently and said, “The House Meeting is in exactly one month. Now that the little Lu Ming can cultivate, he will, without a doubt, go up against Lu Yao for a fight. Then, First Elder and his men will simply take action against Lu Ming. Why do we need to dirty our hands?”</p><p>“Great idea, Young Master Bing,” flattered the two sidekicks.</p><p>Right then, they left the scene quietly.</p><p>Just as they left, an attractively slender body appeared suddenly in the alley.</p><p>If it was not Mu Lan, who else could it be?</p><p>“Heh heh, interesting, now I know it’s the Lu Family’s infamous Young Lord trash. Looks like you’ve deceived everyone!”</p><p>A hushed voice rang and in a blip, Mu Lan disappeared without a trace.</p><p>….</p><p>Back at home, after giving Qiu Yue the Health-replenishing Pills, Lu Ming went back to his room and entered the Supreme Shrine.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming started swallowing Dragon Tiger Pills and began his unlocking of the second divine meridian.</p><p>It was way more difficult to unlock the second divine meridian than the first.</p><p>This time, it took Lu Ming forty-five Mediocre First Level Dragon Tiger Pills and a total of five days to unlock the second divine meridian.</p><p>Once the second divine meridian was unlocked, the Essential Qi within Lu Ming swelled up another notch.</p><p>“I should now pack a bull’s strength with the explosion of my Essential Qi alone, I guess!”</p><p>At First Grade Warrior Realm, Ordinary Martial Artists will achieve up to a bull’s strength of power with the explosion of their Essential Qi, and the power of Essential Qi explosion that Lu Ming now wielded was no less than that of a First Grade Warrior Realm martial artist.</p><p>“Now, to continue.”</p><p>Lu Ming went on to unlock the third divine meridian.</p><p>The third divine meridian was also the hardest.</p><p>It took Lu Ming a whole ten days, and he consumed seventy Dragon Tiger Pill to finally unlock the third divine meridian.</p><p>When the third divine meridian was opened up, the light spots on Lu Ming’s body lit up one by one, and when all a hundred and eight acupuncture points were lit up, it was like the stars in the sky, shining, and shimmering brightly.</p><p>A hundred and eight big acupuncture points and the twelve meridians formed a perfect loop. Continuous waves of thickened, elevated Essential Qi soared within Lu Ming’s meridians.</p><p>“So powerful, three unlocked divine meridian is so much more powerful when compared to two unlocked divine meridians?”</p><p>Analyzing the energy coursing within him, Lu Ming was delighted.</p><p>Three unlocked divine meridians and two unlocked divine meridians, even if it was just one meridian apart, the vast difference between the two was as different as Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Three divine meridians represented perfection, two divine meridians would still be flawed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he could currently gather an Essential Qi whirl in his dantian and leap into the Warrior’s Realm at any given time.</p><p>“Not yet, I’ve not gotten the Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming forcefully suppressed his desire to leap into Warrior Realm, set his gaze upon the second platform beyond the ninety-nine steps.</p><p>“This time, I should be able to go up now, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked towards the second platform.</p><p>Instantaneously, he was on the ninety-ninth step. He was hindered here the last time.</p><p>This time, there was no hindrance at all. In a step, Lu Ming ascended onto the second platform.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
