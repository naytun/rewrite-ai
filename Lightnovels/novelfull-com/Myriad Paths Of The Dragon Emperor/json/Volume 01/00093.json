He used the Dragon serpent steps to its maximum. Although it was only a yellow rank lower level movement technique, Lu Ming’s speed was still extremely fast under the explosion of his powerful essential Qi.</p><p>In just a few minutes, he saw the flat-nosed young man’s figure.</p><p>Hearing the sound of the wind, the flat-nosed young man turned around and was almost scared out of his wits.</p><p>How could he be so fast? Could Zheng have been killed? He had originally thought that Zheng could at least block another hundred moves.</p><p>“Argh! “Ah!” Don’t come over!”</p><p>The flat-nosed youngster ran frantically, shouting wildly.</p><p>However, the distance between him and Lu Ming continued to close.</p><p>The flat-nosed youngster simply couldn’t escape.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>At this time, the flat-nosed young man suddenly stopped, turned around, and knelt down with a plop. His actions were done in one go.</p><p>“Please, please, please don’t kill me. As long as you let me go, I won’t say a word about what happened today.”</p><p>The flat-nosed young man kept kowtowing and shouting.</p><p>“Why should I believe you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a cold smile.</p><p>“I can swear, I swear, I will never tell anyone. If I tell anyone, I will die a horrible death!”</p><p>The flat-nosed young man pointed to the sky and swore.</p><p>“Sure, I can give you a chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly smiled coldly and kicked him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This kick landed directly on the flat-nosed young man’s dantian, scattering his Qi current.</p><p>“Argh! Didn’t you say that you would give me a chance after you destroyed my cultivation?”</p><p>The flat-nosed young man let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the flat-nosed young man’s neck and walked toward the extinct volcano as if he was carrying a little chick.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the place where the battle had taken place.</p><p>At that moment, the stone hunters had all escaped.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>The flat-nosed young man asked in a trembling voice.</p><p>it’s very simple. Walk forward and explore the path. However, you’re not allowed to take the path that has already been explored. Walk on the other side.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed in the direction of the extinct volcano and said indifferently.</p><p>In an instant, the flat-nosed young man’s face turned pale. His voice trembled as he said, ” “Haven’t we already found the path to the extinct volcano? Why do you still want me to Scout the way? No, I’m not going.”</p><p>“Don’t you like to ask others to help you find the way? Now, I want you to try it yourself. It’s fine if you don’t want to go, but I’ll send you to reunite with your senior and junior brothers now.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear. The spear glowed and a cold killing intent enveloped the flat-nosed young man.</p><p>no, no, you can’t do this to me. There are dangers everywhere. I’ll die if I go. I’m begging you, let me go.</p><p>The flat-nosed young man was covered in cold sweat and his body was trembling non-stop.</p><p>Especially when he thought of how the stone hunters had been burned to death, he shuddered.</p><p>Before, when he had watched others go to explore the way, he had gloated and acted arrogantly, as if he was watching ants struggling on their deathbeds. He had no pity at all.</p><p>But now, when it was his turn, he was more afraid than anyone.</p><p>“This is your only chance. My patience is limited. I’ll count to three. If you don’t go after three, then you don’t have to go.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was extremely cold.</p><p>To deal with such a person, what could be more satisfying than giving him a taste of his own medicine?</p><p>“One!”</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“I’ll go, I’ll go!”</p><p>When Lu Ming was about to say three, the flat-nosed young man finally could not take the pressure and shouted. Then, his body trembled and he walked forward step by step.</p><p>The further he walked, the more his body trembled. When he had walked more than a hundred meters, a foul smell came out, and he was so scared that he peed himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a gas burst out from under his feet.</p><p>The flat-nosed young man was so frightened that his soul flew out of his body. He screamed and fell straight down.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He walked up to take a look and was instantly speechless.</p><p>The flat-nosed young man’s face was ashen. He was not breathing at all. He was actually scared to death by a stream of hot air.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and walked back to collect his spoils.</p><p>These were the disciples of the omnipresent Sword School. They must have many valuable things on them. Lu Ming would not miss this opportunity.</p><p>As he searched for the spoils of war, he devoured their blood essence one by one.</p><p>After the search, Lu Ming left the place and returned to the outer area. He then entered the Supreme shrine and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the eighth grade master realm, the blood essence of martial artists below the eighth grade master realm was of little use to him.</p><p>Only those above the eighth grade master realm would be of some help.</p><p>After refining all the blood essence of the omnidirectional Sword School disciple, Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved to a certain extent. However, it was not by much. He was still a distance away from the middle eighth grade master realm. After refining the blood essence, Lu Ming began to check his spoils of war.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, two storage rings appeared.</p><p>It was a pleasant surprise that two of the disciples from the ten directions Sword School had storage rings.</p><p>One was from Zheng Zha, and the other was from the ninth grade master realm youth.</p><p>Then, with a thought, a pile of items appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Lu Ming started to count the silver notes.</p><p>“Why is there only so little?”</p><p>After counting, Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>The silver notes of the twenty or so disciples of the ten directions Sword School only added up to four million taels.</p><p>More than four million taels of silver seemed like a lot, but it depended on where he had gotten it.</p><p>The ten or so disciples of the Shi Fang Sword School were at least at the sixth grade master realm. On average, each of them only had less than two hundred thousand taels of silver. This was considered very little.</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming felt at ease.</p><p>It was very normal. Just like him, the extra silver was exchanged for contribution points, which were then used to exchange for resources that were useful to him to improve his strength.</p><p>Most of the disciples of the ten directions Sword School were the same. They kept some silver on them and exchanged the rest.</p><p>After keeping the silver notes, Lu Ming looked at the other items.</p><p>There were some scattered pills that were not worth much money. Lu Ming put them aside. In the end, his gaze fell on a few books.</p><p>Wild wave slash, a yellow grade low level sword technique.</p><p>[ soaring cloud steps ], a yellow grade high level movement technique.</p><p>Hunyuan technique, a yellow grade upper level cultivation skill.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to learn three cultivation methods and martial arts techniques in a row.</p><p>Generally speaking, sect disciples like them would rarely have cultivation methods and martial skill secret books on them, because most cultivation methods and martial skill secret books were rented from the sect’s Library Hall to cultivate.</p><p>There was a time limit, and when the time was up, they would have to return it.</p><p>Of course, there were also exceptions. Some people had a fortuitous encounter and obtained some cultivation methods and martial skill secret books. These cultivation methods and secret books were for their own private use.</p><p>For example, these books were mostly privately owned by the disciples of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>He had obtained the cloud treading steps from the ninth grade master realm youth.</p><p>If he were to sell these three cultivation methods and martial skill manuals, they would be worth at least five to six million silver.</p><p>He had really profited.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s gaze landed on the fourth book, he was greatly shocked.</p><p>Flaming Vajra Arts, a body-tempering technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
