I’ve checked every meal we ate. There’s no poison at all.</p><p>The second brother of the yin mountain three ghosts called out.</p><p>“Second brother Yin, I know you’re an expert in using poison. Moreover, you three ghosts of Mount Yin have roamed the martial world for many years, so you’re extremely vigilant. You’re not as gullible as these young boys. Soul devouring banner, I wonder if you’ve heard of it?”</p><p>Zhu Bing smiled faintly.</p><p>“What? Gu poison, could it be the southern wasteland Gu poison?”</p><p>Second brother Yin cried out in alarm.</p><p>haha, that’s right. I’ve paid a huge price for this soul devouring banner. The soul devouring banner is just an extremely tiny worm. It’s impossible to distinguish it from food. Moreover, the usual poison testing methods are ineffective.</p><p>Zhu Bing smiled proudly.</p><p>damn it, old man. Hand over the antidote, or I’ll exterminate your entire Zhu family.</p><p>Xu Feiyun roared in anger.</p><p>“It’s a pity that there’s no cure for the soul devouring banner,” Zhu Bing said lightly.</p><p>“What? There’s no cure?”</p><p>The faces of the three ghosts of Mount Yin, Xu Feiyun, and the woman were as pale as paper, without a trace of blood.</p><p>“Old man, I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>Xu Feiyun revealed a look of despair as he roared and pounced towards Zhu Bing.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Bing suddenly let out a strange sound.</p><p>As soon as this sound came out, Xu Feiyun’s body suddenly froze. Then, he held his head with both hands and let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“Argh! “Ah!” It hurts!”</p><p>Xu Feiyun roared loudly. His long sword danced wildly as he slashed. He kept letting out shrill screams.</p><p>In just a few breaths, when Zhu Bing’s voice stopped, Xu Feiyun also stopped. However, his eyes were dull, as if he had lost his soul, and he stood there in a daze.</p><p>haha, now that you’ve been poisoned by the soul devouring banner, you’re my puppet. You still want to resist? ”</p><p>Zhu Bing sneered.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>The three Yin mountain ghosts could not believe their eyes.</p><p>“Zhu Bing, there are disciples of the mystical sword sect here, yet you dare to lay your hands on them. If this gets out, your entire Zhu family will be exterminated.”</p><p>Big Boss Yin called out unwillingly.</p><p>“So what if it’s the mystical sword sect? As long as he was dead, who would know that the Zhou family was destroyed? Alright, now you guys can go together.”</p><p>Zhu Bing said, and then made a squeaking sound.</p><p>”</p><p>The yin mountain three ghosts and the others let out shrill screams.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Zhou Linshan shouted. He wanted to rush over and stop them, but the three ghosts of Mount Yin had all gone mad. They were incomparably terrifying. They exchanged a few blows with the Zhou clan’s people, and the Zhou clan’s people were forced back.</p><p>After being poisoned by the Gu, he was not afraid of death, and even his battle strength had increased by a level.</p><p>However, at this moment, Zhu Bing let out a cry of disbelief, ” “Lu Ming, why are you fine?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood there with an indifferent expression, watching everything.</p><p>“What’s up? Why am I in trouble? I’m not poisoned.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You’re not poisoned? It’s impossible. I’ve checked every time, and you’ve eaten every single meal. How can you not be poisoned?”</p><p>Zhu Bing cried out in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had their own tents. Every meal was delivered by Zhu Bing’s men. He would check it every time to ensure that nothing would go wrong.</p><p>He clearly remembered that Lu Ming would eat it all up every time.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten that there are things like storage rings in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“A storage ring? No wonder, no wonder. The mystical sword sect’s disciples are indeed extraordinary. At such a young age, you even have a treasure like a storage ring. It seems like your status in the mystical sword sect is not ordinary.”</p><p>Zhu Bing came to a realization.</p><p>Despite all his calculations, he had missed out on the storage ring.</p><p>Storage rings were not common goods. On the contrary, they were extremely rare and were basically monopolized by the major forces. Even if one had money, one could not buy one.</p><p>For people like the three ghosts of Mount Yin, they could still take out a few hundred thousand taels of silver, but they did not have a storage ring, because there was no place to buy it.</p><p>There was a price but no market.</p><p>but why are you so careful? even if you have a storage ring, you can’t possibly not eat it, right? ”</p><p>Zhu Bing asked curiously.</p><p>because you guys have a problem.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. from the first day we set off, I already felt that something was wrong. The dignified lady of the Zhu family actually did not dare to let others meet her. Although you said that it was because she was not feeling well, I had no choice. I am a very careful person, so I could only eat the rations that I brought.</p><p>after that, Chen Xin was killed, which made him even more suspicious. I observed on the way that Chen Xin kept looking at the carriage. I guess that this old man is a lecher and has seen the Zhu family’s eldest daughter before. So that night, Chen Xin probably couldn’t control his lust and wanted to touch the Zhu family’s eldest daughter.</p><p>he must have found out that the Zhu family’s young miss was a fake, so he was killed to silence her. How could an ordinary person kill him so easily? now that I think about it, the one who killed him was you.</p><p>also, as far as I know, your Zhu family is not weak, but you only sent a few guards to escort me, and they are all so weak. This is even more suspicious. With so many suspicious points, how would I dare to eat the food you send? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s analysis was clear and logical.</p><p>“Sigh, it’s not easy to earn some money these days.”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Haha, I didn’t think that you would be so meticulous at such a young age. But so what if you weren’t poisoned? Today, you’ll still die.”</p><p>Zhu Bing’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>With a move of his hand, a long spear appeared in Zhu Bing’s hand.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Under Zhu Bing’s command, the experts of the Zhu clan took action one after another, fighting with the people of the Zhou clan.</p><p>At the same time, he made a squeaking sound. The three ghosts of Mount Yin roared like wild beasts and pounced on Zhou Linshan and the seven elders of the Zhou family.</p><p>A chaotic battle began.</p><p>The moment they made a move, the Zhou family was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>The three ghosts of Mount Yin were not afraid of death. They exploded with terrifying combat strength and entangled Zhou Linshan and the Zhou family elder.</p><p>However, the Zhu clan elder was able to free up his hands and kill the other Zhou clan experts as easily as taking something from his pocket.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll personally send you on your way.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhu Bing stomped his feet and dashed towards Lu Ming like a cannonball. The long spear in his hand was like a bolt of lightning, aiming straight for Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword was unsheathed, and the sword light burst out, clashing with the spear.</p><p>With a clang, Lu Ming did not move, but Zhu Bing took three steps back.</p><p>Zhu Bing’s eyes revealed a look of disbelief as he roared, ” “How is that possible? How can a mere fifth grade master realm cultivator be this strong?”</p><p>He was at the early phase of the seventh grade master realm, two levels higher than Lu Ming. It was simply unbelievable that he was forced to retreat by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Even a disciple of the mystical sword sect couldn’t possibly be this powerful, right?</p><p>“Compared to Ning Feng, I’m still a little lacking.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Although Zhu Bing’s cultivation was the same as Ning Feng’s, his combat strength was definitely not on par with Ning Feng’s. The disciples of the mystical sword sect were naturally not something that these small families could compare to.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
