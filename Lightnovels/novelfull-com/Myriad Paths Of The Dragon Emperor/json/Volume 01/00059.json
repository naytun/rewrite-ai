How despicable! Looks like Lu Ming’s gonna lose.”</p><p>Amongst those who were watching, some shook their heads and sighed while some smirked icily.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming was forced to a corner after a few moves. It was getting more and more dangerous for him.</p><p>At the viewing platform, Mu Lan barked as she threw a punch at Ning Kong, “Scram, Ning Kong!”</p><p>“Mu Lan, are you gonna break the sect rules as a chief elder?” Ning Kong matched Mu Lan’s palm technique as he snapped.</p><p>Fortunately, both Mu Lan and Ning Kong were extremely careful with their strength. If not, the viewing platform would have crumbled to pieces.</p><p>“Disgusting!”</p><p>Feng Wu, Yuan Hui, and their group shrieked, but they were blocked by the troop that Ning Kong brought with him.</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Ning Feng’s attacks swept through like a tornado. They were vicious and brutal.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated as he fought, but his gleaming eyes were clear as day as he stared intently at Ning Feng. He was looking for an opportunity.</p><p>“Die! Haha, die!” Ning Feng cackled. He was oppressing Lu Ming, and he had never felt better.</p><p>“How dare you go against me, you filthy imbecile? How dare you embarrass me by challenging me to a duel? Now, tremble before me and regret!” he laughed hysterically.</p><p>“Now!” Lu Ming’s eyes shone like the sun. He stopped retreating and leaped towards Ning Feng.</p><p>As he leaped, a blood-red light flashed on Lu Ming as he exploded his blood meridians. This would be his strongest moment.</p><p>Now that his blood meridians had risen to the Fourth Level, he could shield him from the attacks he received and increase his strength by 40%.</p><p>Lu Ming’s actions shocked everyone to the edge of their seats.</p><p>What was Lu Ming doing? Was he that eager to die?</p><p>Ning Feng was slightly taken aback. He laughed nastily and said, “No matter what you’re planning, you’re dead meat.”</p><p>Screeching Sword Qi merged to form a Sword Qi storm that quickly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>However, when the Sword Qi landed on Lu Ming, he all but shuddered slightly, and continued to bulldoze towards Ning Feng. Lu Ming raised his right hand and blocked Ning Feng’s long sword with his battle sword. Meanwhile, his left hand threw a heavy punch.</p><p>It all happened so quickly that Ning Feng had no time to react.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As Lu Ming’s punch landed sturdily on Ning Feng’s Dantian, the force of the punch violently tore through Ning Feng’s Dantian.</p><p>Instantly, Ning Feng’s Qi cyclone vibrated vigorously and was on the verge of exploding. Ning Feng’s aura dropped drastically like a punctured balloon and returned to the Seventh Grade Master Realm in a heartbeat.</p><p>It did not stop there as it continued dropping to stop at the top of Sixth Grade Master Realm.</p><p>Ning Feng’s cultivation was far from stable since he had just broken through to the Seventh Grade Master Realm. Lu Ming’s punch severely destroyed the berserk Essential Qi from his consumption of the Spirit-exploding Pill and he returned to his Sixth Grade Master Realm cultivation level.</p><p>If it were not for the berserk Essential Qi from consuming the Spirit-exploding Pill, Lu Ming’s punch would have destroyed Ning Feng’s cultivation.</p><p>“Ah!” Ning Feng flew backward upon impact as he cried out in despair, landing heavily ten meters away. Blood spewed out from his mouth.</p><p>Mu Lan, Feng Wu, Yuan Hui, and Ning Kong were flabbergasted.</p><p>Everyone present was confounded.</p><p>What just happened?</p><p>All they saw was Lu Ming advancing towards Ning Feng instead of retreating. They were just thinking to themselves if Lu Ming had a strong death wish when they saw Ning Feng flying backward with a cry of despair and was now vomiting blood on stage.</p><p>“Feng’er!” Ning Kong was first to react as he bellowed.</p><p>Astonished, Ning Feng struggled to pick himself up as he yelled, “How…how are you still alive?”</p><p>He knew his attacks had landed on Lu Ming, but the latter seemed fine like nothing had happened to him.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn.” Lu Ming stepped out. His eyes were steely cold as his sword swung toward Ning Feng.</p><p>Ning Feng was paralyzed with fear as he robotically raised his sword in the attempt to shield himself from the attack. He was injured, and he only had a Sixth Grade Master Realm cultivation, thus he was no match for Lu Ming at all.</p><p>All it took was one attack for Ning Feng to retreat quickly and fearfully while vomiting blood.</p><p>“All you had was a few more years of cultivation, Ning Feng, and you thought that was enough to make me regret my decision and shake me to the core? You are so far off. Now, let’s send you on your way.”</p><p>While Lu Ming slowly sauntered towards Ning Feng, a cold smile hung on his lips as ice-cold killing intent shimmered in his eyes.</p><p>On the viewing platform, Ning Kong bellowed, “How dare you? Stop right there, Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Stop?” Lu Ming threw a glance at Ning Kong as he replied unemotionally, “When Ning Feng had the upper hand, why didn’t you ask him to stop? What’s wrong with your brain for you to be ordering me to stop now?”</p><p>When Lu Ming was done, he hacked his sword towards Ning Feng again, ignoring Ning Kong in the process.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Ning Feng could hardly block Lu Ming’s attacks. When his body gave way, he violently shuddered as his sword fell out of his hands.</p><p>“Dad, Dad! Save me!” Ning Feng shrieked as he scrambled to save himself from the impending doom.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you continue attacking? Die!” Ning Kong roared with rage as he swooped in like an eagle, making his way to the Vermillion Bird Stage.</p><p>Mu Lan moved and followed closely behind him. She threw a palm attack towards Ning Kong.</p><p>However, Ning Kong turned behind and retaliated with a thrust-out palm.</p><p>Both palms collided while they fought in the air.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A resounding boom followed by a strong gust of force that came from both Mu Lan and Ning Kong’s attacks broke out. Both of them landed on the ground in a swing.</p><p>Right after landing, Mu Lan stood in Ning Kong’s way.</p><p>“Piss off, Mu Lan!” Ning Kong roared.</p><p>Mu Lan smiled coyly and said, ” Ning Kong, duels on the Vermillion Bird Stage are battles to the death with no external interruption allowed. Are you gonna go against sect rules?”</p><p>Ning Kong’s face twisted and contorted with rage. He was so angry that he nearly vomited blood. That was exactly what he told Mu Lan a while ago, and she just dished it all back to him word for word.</p><p>“I don’t care. Piss off!” yelled Ning Kong.</p><p>“What thick skin you have on this old, wrinkly face of yours, Ning Kong. Do you wanna go there? No way!” Mu Lan’s aura locked him firmly in place.</p><p>Mu Lan was so pleased when she saw how contorted Ning Kong’s face was.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Ning Feng let out an anguished cry yet again on the Vermillion Bird Stage.</p><p>Lu Ming punched him squarely on his stomach and broke a few ribs. Ning Feng lay limply on the ground, heaving blood.</p><p>With one foot firmly on Ning Feng’s torso, Lu Ming leered coldly at Ning Feng.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, Lu Ming. I beg you. Don’t kill me please!” Ning Feng cowered in fear as he begged loudly for his life.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you dare kill my son, I will destroy you!” Ning Kong burned with anger. He wanted so badly to rush up to the stage, but Mu Lan would not leave him alone.</p><p>“I’m waiting, old man!” Lu Ming smiled mirthlessly and swung his sword without hesitation.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ning Feng and Ning Kong shouted in unison.</p><p>Slash!</p><p>Blood spattered all over the Vermillion Bird Stage.</p><p>Ning Feng held his severed neck tightly with regret, fear, and anger in his eyes, and plopped on stage with the life draining out of him.</p><p>CREATORS’ THOUGHTS</p><p>Riise</p><p>From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren’t selected will be refunded within 30 days.
