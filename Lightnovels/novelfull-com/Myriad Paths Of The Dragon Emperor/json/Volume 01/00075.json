However, he managed to hold himself back in the end.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming bade Li Ping farewell and rode the dark blood Wolf back to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>After five days, the mystical sword sect was already within sight.</p><p>“Go. Since you’ve ferried me for so long, I’ll set you free.”</p><p>Lu Ming patted the dark blood Wolf’s neck.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The dark blood Wolf cried out excitedly and ran away, as if it was afraid that Lu Ming would go back on his words. It disappeared into the forest in the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked towards the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>However, he didn’t return to the dormitory first. Instead, he went to the hall of missions.</p><p>He had to hand in the mission first.</p><p>He walked into the mission Palace Hall and came to a counter.</p><p>“Junior Brother, are you here to accept the mission or to submit it?”</p><p>A pretty young woman asked from behind the counter.</p><p>“I’m here to hand in my mission.”</p><p>Lu Ming passed a mission card to the young lady. It was the blood Reiki flower’s mission.</p><p>As for the Zhu family’s escort mission, since the Zhu family had already been destroyed, there was naturally no need to hand it in.</p><p>“Blood flower mission? I wonder how many blood Reiki flowers you’ve collected?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>She knew that this task was not easy to do. It was not easy to collect the blood Reiki flowers. Not only did they have to go to the dark blood Mountain, but they also only needed 100 contribution points to collect one. It would take too long to go back and forth. It was not worth it at all. Therefore, not many people accepted it.</p><p>She was rather curious about how many flowers Lu Ming could collect.</p><p>“Senior Sister, please check.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a huge pile of blood Reiki flowers appeared on the counter.</p><p>“This … So many?”</p><p>The young woman looked at the blood Reiki flower on the counter and was stunned. Her small mouth was wide open.</p><p>She had never expected that Lu Ming would be able to collect so many blood Reiki flowers.</p><p>The pile of blood Reiki flowers also attracted the attention of a large number of people nearby.</p><p>“So many blood Reiki flowers. Who is this person?”</p><p>“You don’t even know this year’s rookie King?”</p><p>so it’s him. He’s so lucky to have found so many blood Reiki flowers.</p><p>“You’re indeed very lucky!”</p><p>Envious voices could be heard from all around.</p><p>“That … Can you help me check?”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and waved it in front of the young woman’s eyes.</p><p>“Ah, Ah, okay.”</p><p>The young woman came to her senses and quickly helped Lu Ming to count.</p><p>there are 55 blood Reiki flowers in total. Each one costs 100 contribution points. That’s 5500 contribution points in total.</p><p>The young woman said, her eyes revealing a light of envy.</p><p>5,500 contribution points! She didn’t know how long it would take for her to earn that much.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and passed his identity Jade card to the young lady. After a while, Lu Ming’s identity Jade card had an additional 5500 contribution points.</p><p>After handing in the mission, Lu Ming did not stop and went straight to his dormitory.</p><p>Lu Ming did not notice that there were two young men outside the missions Hall who had been watching him leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back. Hurry back and report to senior brother Yao Tianyu.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>……</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming returned to the dormitory.</p><p>He realized that pang Shi and Hua Chi were not around.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that pang Shi and Hua Chi were most likely cultivating somewhere else or doing missions.</p><p>Lu Ming did not think much of it. He walked into the room, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>After a few days of cultivation, Lu Ming’s cultivation had already been completely consolidated. He was now fully focused on advancing towards the middle stage of the seventh grade master realm.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, there was a loud crash from the door of the courtyard outside. It seemed to have been kicked open.</p><p>“It’s not pang Shi or Hua Chi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>If it were pang Shi or Hua Chi, they would not have kicked the door in like this.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked out of the room. He saw two young men walking in from outside.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s good that you’re here.”</p><p>A young man in a red robe sneered when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>“We are the Azure Dragon Hall’s disciples. Senior brother Yao Tianyu is summoning you. Hurry up and bring the dark Bloodstone to the Azure Dragon Hall and meet him.”</p><p>The red-robed young man said coldly. His tone was filled with arrogance and a commanding tone.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He suddenly remembered.</p><p>Wasn’t he the Yao Tianyu on the bronze list that the Azure Dragon Hall disciples had mentioned on the dark blood Mountain?</p><p>He was really in a hurry. Lu Ming had just returned and he was already here.</p><p>And it was a summon? She wanted him to meet her?</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He replied indifferently with two words, ” “I’m not free!”</p><p>“What? Not free? Senior brother Yao Tianyu has summoned you. Even if you have a serious matter to deal with, you have to put it down. Quickly take the dark blood Stone and come with us.”</p><p>The red-robed youth berated.</p><p>He still had a haughty expression.</p><p>Yao Tianyu, what the hell are you talking about? I told you, I’m not free. Get lost.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and he said coldly.</p><p>“What? You’re courting death, you …”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Before the red-robed young man could say anything else, Lu Ming let out a furious roar and charged forward, his fists blasting out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two young men were also seventh grade master realm, but they were no match for Lu Ming. They were sent flying out of the door and landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at the two of them and said coldly, ” I told you to get lost. If you don’t, I don’t mind throwing the two of you off the Vermilion Bird Peak.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, don’t be so arrogant. Just you wait. You won’t have a good end for offending senior brother Yao Tianyu.”</p><p>The red-robed young man shouted loudly, and then fled with the other man.</p><p>“The bronze ranking?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He didn’t know much about the bronze list, but he knew that anyone who could be on the bronze list was a super genius.</p><p>The highest cultivation level of a bronze disciple was the ninth grade master realm. Once they broke through to the great Martial Master realm, as long as they were not too old, they would be promoted to a silver disciple.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list were all at the peak of the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Moreover, they weren’t ordinary peak ninth grade master realm experts. They were all geniuses with extremely powerful combat strength.</p><p>It was said that an ordinary ninth grade master couldn’t even last one move against a genius on the bronze list.</p><p>The geniuses on the bronze list were all unrivaled in the same realm, and they could even fight against those of a higher realm.</p><p>To the current Lu Ming, he was undefeatable.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his room and started to think.</p><p>my martial arts skills are too weak now. I have to practice the fire gun chant as soon as possible. But before that, I need to practice the basic gun skills.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>No matter what weapon one cultivated, one would need a Foundation. Lu Ming had never cultivated a spear technique before. Without a Foundation, it was impossible for him to cultivate a black level low quality spear technique the moment he started.</p><p>One had to have a solid foundation for the spear technique in order to cultivate a profound spear technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
