There was none of the solemnity from her lecture just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was pounding erratically from being at such a close distance to her. “Elder Mu Lan, why did you ask me to stay behind?”</p><p>...</p><p>Mu Lan grinned. “There’s no need to be so formal. Treat me as your senior sister!”</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu!” Lu Ming performed a fist salute.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve caused quite an uproar indeed. You’ve become the Apprentice Champion just after enrolling. To be honest, it’s beyond my expectations!” Mu Lan scrutinized him carefully for a moment, then asked in a curious manner, “During the test, you’re the one who killed Duanmu Jue, weren’t you?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide the truth. In fact, something like this would be easily surmised, so there was no need to cover it up.</p><p>“I knew it. Still, you must be careful. Duanmu Jue was a rare genius of the Duanmu family. They won’t let you get away with it so easily. Plus, you’ve challenged Ning Feng. Are you sure about victory?” Mu Lan asked rather worriedly.</p><p>“I’m about 60, 70% sure!” Lu Ming declared.</p><p>“60 to 70%? Looks like you’re very confident!” Mu Lan stared at Lu Ming, flabbergasted.</p><p>He just smiled faintly.</p><p>“You should know a little about Ning Feng’s strength, but did you know that his father is the Chief Elder of the Vermillion Bird Hall?” Mu Lan asked.</p><p>“I do.” Lu Ming nodded. He had learned about this from Hua Chi.</p><p>The elders of Mystical Sword Sect were divided into Ordinary Elders, Silver-robed Elders, and Gold-robed Elders.</p><p>Silver-robed Elders and Gold-robed Elders had substantial authority as their position held great weight.</p><p>As for Ordinary Elders, most of them held hollow titles and they did not have much power.</p><p>Even so, amongst the Ordinary Elders, there was a type of elder who had immense authority, and that was the Chief Elder.</p><p>The Chief Elder was the highest rank among the Ordinary Elders, second only to Silver-robed Elders. Of course, his cultivation was formidable as well.</p><p>Lu Ming had once heard Feng Wu mention that Mu Lan was a Chief Elder in the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>“However, there’s one thing you’re definitely unaware of. Ning Feng’s father has pledged allegiance to the Duanmu family. Therefore, this time around, the Duanmu family will surely support Ning Feng with all they have. Ning Feng is already a top Sixth Grade Master in the first place. What I’m most afraid of is that he’ll achieve a breakthrough in this period.” Mu Lan’s expression was serious.</p><p>“Hmph, the Duanmu family again.” Lu Ming’s eyes flashed icily.</p><p>“Therefore, Lu Ming, if you need any help from me, please ask,” Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Really? In that case, Senior Sister Mu Lan, can you lend me 3,000 contribution points?” Lu Ming stared at Mu Lan anxiously. He only had 700 contribution points now. It was hardly empowering, so it would be better to borrow some as a reserve.</p><p>“3,000 contribution points? Why do you need so many contribution points? Your newbies’ test awarded you with 7,000 contribution points, didn’t it?”</p><p>“I’ve used them up!”</p><p>“Used…used up?” Mu Lan was rather speechless. He used 7,000 contribution points up in such a short time. Did Lu Ming eat his contribution points or something?</p><p>“That’s right, they’re used up. Senior Sister Mu Lan, could you lend me some?” He pouted at Mu Lan pitifully.</p><p>“Alright, give me your identity jade piece,” she said.</p><p>Lu Ming took out his identity jade piece and handed it to her.</p><p>After she took it and then took out her own identity jade piece. She placed the two identity jade pieces together, then channeled her Essential Qi. The light of the jade pieces started to twinkle.</p><p>Mu Lan’s soft, smooth finger swiped over her identity jade piece a few times, following which the glow of the identity jade pieces slowly dimmed.</p><p>When Lu Ming took back his identity jade piece and looked, he had an additional 3,000 contribution points.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when you’ve earned some contribution points, you must pay me back. You know very well that women have huge expenses.” Mu Lan fixed Lu Ming with her unwavering stare with distress plain on her face.</p><p>“How petty of you when you were just proudly announcing that I should ask you if I need any help!” Lu Ming muttered to himself darkly.</p><p>“What did you say?” Mu Lan gave him a sudden glare that pinned him down viciously.</p><p>“Nothing, I didn’t say anything. Senior Sister Mu Lan, I’m going back to cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming tore off in a hurry.</p><p>As she stared into the direction where Lu Ming had left, Mu Lan’s face broke into a smile again, and she said softly, “How interesting. Lu Ming, I hope you don’t disappoint me. Although it’s still a long way from now, one day you just might have a chance to enter that place!”</p><p>1</p><p>With that, she got up and left as well.</p><p>…</p><p>Upon returning to his residence, Lu Ming went into the Supreme Shrine, then sat down cross-legged. He took out a jade box and opened it. Ten crystal pieces were nestled inside.</p><p>Each of these crystals was sealed in nine blood-red drops of blood essence. These ten crystals contained Fourth Grade Second Level demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a piece and pinched it forcefully. Inscriptions flickered upon the surface of the Spirit-sealing Crystal.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Following that, the Spirit-sealing Crystal shattered into a pile of fragments. Nine drops of demonic beast blood essence floated up.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately controlled his blood meridian to create a powerful suction, consuming the nine drops of blood essence. In a short while, they were transformed into energy that surged throughout his body.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the True War Dragon Technique, starting to absorb and cultivate this energy.</p><p>His cultivation level swiftly advanced.</p><p>Soon enough, the blood essence of a single demonic beast was fully processed.</p><p>“The vital energy contained within the blood essence is less potent than that from a fresh kill,” Lu Ming was carefully evaluating the situation.</p><p>This was to be expected. Although the Spirit-sealing Crystal could seal off energy loss, it was not 100% effective. Some of it would still be lost regardless.</p><p>“Let’s go on!”</p><p>Lu Ming shattered a second Spirit-sealing Crystal and began cultivating.</p><p>In a flash, a whole day passed. The ten portions of Fourth Grade Second Level demonic beast blood essence had been completely cultivated.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming’s cultivation did not progress to the Fourth Grade Master Realm. He was still at the top of the Third Grade Master Realm.</p><p>‘As expected, after honing the Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, it takes up even more energy.’ Lu Ming pondered hopelessly.</p><p>Before this, at the First Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, the density of his Essential Qi was two times greater than ordinary Essential Qi.</p><p>At that time, the energy required to advance his cultivation was three times more than other Essential Qi.</p><p>Now that the density of his Essential Qi was three times greater than usual, the required energy was nine times more than other Essential Qi.</p><p>It was a terrifying nine-fold increase.</p><p>Another aspect was that his blood meridian still had not leveled up. It was still a Third Level blood meridian.</p><p>He had consumed the blood essence of ten Fourth Grade Second Level demonic beasts, yet he still had not leveled up. Logically, his blood meridian should have increased in level.</p><p>Was a Third Level blood meridian really his limit?</p><p>Lu Ming would not accept that.</p><p>“I don’t care. You reap what you sow, after all. I’ll go on cultivating.”</p><p>He took out another jade box. This one contained ten portions of Fifth Grade Second Level demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>Following that, he began to devour and refine the Fifth Grade Second Level demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>As expected of a Fifth Grade Second Level demonic beast blood essence, the vital energy it contained was many times more than that of a Fourth Grade Second Level.</p><p>After Lu Ming had processed the blood essence of six Fifth Grade Second Level demonic beasts, his cultivation finally experienced a breakthrough, reaching the Fourth Grade Master Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
