His blood meridian erupted as he turned around and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>He understood that begging for his life or even throwing threats was useless. He could tell that Lu Ming’s moves were cruel, firm, and concise from the way he made a move just now.</p><p>Even a talented disciple from the Duanmu Family had been killed just like that. He was unbelievably bold and would definitely not fear the Wei Family.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Their blades clashed against each other as they faced each other in a magnificent battle.</p><p>The eruption of Lu Ming’s blood meridian had ended well before that moment. However, with the help of the True War Dragon Technique and the Fourth Stage of the Lustrous Sword Art, he towered over Wei Ziyou.</p><p>Wei Ziyou’s sword technique was merely an Inferior Yellow Level sword technique that was in the Fourth Stage.</p><p>Their blades clashed as they waged war for over tens of moves. Lu Ming’s sword technique grew in speed until he finally pierced Wei Ziyou’s heart with a stab.</p><p>Wei Ziyou lost in a head-on battle and losing spelled his death.</p><p>1</p><p>Lu Ming then looked somewhere else with a sneer and went in pursuit of that direction.</p><p>Fleeing for his life, Wei Ziming wanted nothing more than to grow another pair of legs at that moment.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How?! He even butchered Master Realm martial artists. Little brother is no match for him even if he was stronger! I must flee and ask Father to send powerhouses to kill Lu Ming,” Wei Ziming growled as he was making a run for it.</p><p>“Are you still thinking about killing me at a time like this?” Suddenly, a voice rang out beside Wei Ziming.</p><p>“Ah!” Wei Ziming screamed in fright. He turned his head around to see Lu Ming leering at him, and he felt chilled to the bone.</p><p>Wei Ziming dared not continue his escape. He stopped in his tracks and kneeled in a heartbeat as he began to plead, “Lu Ming, spare me! I’m begging you!”</p><p>This gave Lu Ming a slight surprise. It turned out that Wei Ziming was weak-willed, a completely different person from Wei Ziyou.</p><p>“I’ve already killed Wei Ziyou. Do you think I’ll let you off?” Lu Ming smiled feebly.</p><p>“Lu Ming-no, Brother Ming, don’t worry. I won’t utter a word about what happened today. Also, you’ve killed Wei Ziyou, so that’s great! He was more talented than I am. I lived in his shadow and always wanted him dead. Now that he’s gone, nobody will contest my position as the Lord of the Guardian Fire City,” Wei Ziming begged pleadingly as tears and snot slid down his face.</p><p>2</p><p>However, his mind was a howling fury. If he lived to tell the tale, he would definitely return Lu Ming the favor back by tenfold or even a hundredfold.</p><p>“If I don’t kill you, aren’t I just waiting for your revenge? Do you think I’m that stupid?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“No…” Wei Ziming yelped. He tried to get up and take off, but his head flew into the distance at the flash of a blade.</p><p>“One of them got away. What a pity!” Lu Ming murmured.</p><p>There was still a youth from the Duanmu Family who was in the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm. He turned around with all his might and was so quick that it was impossible to catch up with him.</p><p>Pfff!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed as a mouthful of fresh blood suddenly spurted out from his mouth.</p><p>‘The attacks of Martial Realm are really strong!’ He sighed.</p><p>He had erupted his blood meridian and blocked the attacks of Duanmu Fei and others just now. Although he was protected from half the power of those attacks, and another portion with the protection from the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm, he was still injured.</p><p>However, it was worth the injury in exchange for the lives of three Master Realm experts.</p><p>From the perspective of combat power, Lu Ming might not have been able to handle three of them, even if he had the Spirit-Devouring Worm.</p><p>Lu Ming had used the peculiar skill of the Spirit-Devouring Worm to surprise them just now and defeat them in one go, so Duanmu Fei and the youth in the brocade garb did not even get the chance to erupt their blood meridians.</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his lips and returned to the battlefield. He consumed the blood essence of Wei Ziyou, Duanmu Fei, and the youth in the brocade garb.</p><p>After that, he left the area and found himself a secluded spot to begin refining the blood essence.</p><p>The blood essences of the three Master Realm experts held immeasurable energy. Even if only half of it was converted into Essential Qi, it would significantly accelerate Lu Ming’s journey in his cultivation.</p><p>At the same time, the injuries that he sustained were rapidly recovering.</p><p>After the blood essences of the three Master Realm martial artists were fully refined, another pale red meridian focal point appeared beside the two red meridian focal points on the Spirit-Devouring Worm.</p><p>It was a Third Level blood meridian. Lu Ming’s blood meridian had ascended to another level, reaching the Third Level.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak top of Ninth Grade Warrior Realm. He was just shy of breaking into Master Realm.</p><p>However, it was that small gap that was blocking Lu Ming’s journey.</p><p>‘I’ve been improving too rapidly in this period of time. My Essential Qi is too impure and my foundation isn’t solid enough. It’s no wonder I can’t make the breakthrough.’</p><p>With the increased amount of blood essence devoured came the drawbacks. After all, the improvement did not come from his own cultivation, so his foundation was not solid and his Essential Qi was impure.</p><p>Were it not for that, he would have been able to step into Master Realm with the blood essence from the three Master Realm experts.</p><p>‘I’ll have to stop devouring blood essences and spend some time consolidating my foundation.’</p><p>Lu Ming believed that his Essential Qi would once again be pure and viscous after spending some time consolidating his foundation which would naturally lead to him breaking through the Master Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming then found another spot to move to. He did not continue to hunt for demonic beasts but concentrated on cultivating the True War Dragon Technique and other martial arts skills instead. He spent a total of nine days cultivating.</p><p>After nine days of grueling cultivation, Lu Ming’s Essential Qi was no longer impure. It had returned to being pure and viscous while his foundation was solid.</p><p>Naturally, it led to Lu Ming’s cultivation breaking through into the Master Realm.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A black Sword Qi shot out when Lu Ming slashed his sword, chopping a tree that was as thick as a human waist.</p><p>Essential Qi was able to physically manifest in the Master Realm. It was unbelievably strong and was able to form Sword Qi and Qi strikes.</p><p>“My Essential Qi is several times thicker now! If I were to battle against Master Realm martial artists like Wei Ziyou and Duanmu Fei, I’d be able to end them in one move.” Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered brightly. “Let’s try out the Dragon Serpent Steps.”</p><p>Over that period of time, his other martial arts skills did not improve. However, the Dragon Serpent Steps made another breakthrough, reaching the Sixth Stage called the “One with Martial Arts” stage. It was the highest stage of a martial arts skill.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>In an explosion of Essential Qi and the vibrations of his muscles, Lu Ming’s figure darted around like the wind. The leaves that had fallen onto the ground were dancing in the air while his figure was already 23 meters away.</p><p>Make no mistake, it was 23 meters. The supposed distance traversed in the “One with Martial Arts” stage was a little over 12 meters. However, his breakthrough to the Master Realm allowed him to achieve his current distance.</p><p>A higher level of cultivation would naturally lead to a greater effect when using the same martial arts skill.</p><p>‘There are still four days left from the end of the trial. I’ll have to do my best to find those point-worthy metal pieces.’</p><p>Lu Ming darted away and disappeared into the woods.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
