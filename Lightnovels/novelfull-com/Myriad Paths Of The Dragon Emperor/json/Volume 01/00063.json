You are a disciple of the Flying Cloud sect. Stop!</p><p>Blood hand Wu mo cried out in alarm.</p><p>“You think I’ll stop just because you say so?”</p><p>The noble young master sneered. His sword light did not stop, forcing Wu mo to retreat.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>In the end, the noble son’s sword light left a long wound on Wu Mo’s arm, and blood flowed out.</p><p>At this moment, the noble young master sheathed his sword and stood up. He said proudly, ” “This time, I’m just teaching you a lesson. Next time, you’ll die! Remember, I’m the core disciple of the Flying Cloud sect, Xu Feiyun. What bloody hand? You’re just trash in the eyes of the Flying Cloud sect. ”</p><p>so he’s a core disciple of the Flying Cloud sect. No wonder he’s so strong. This Wu mo is just asking for it.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. He shook his head and smiled.</p><p>In the eastern part of the blazing sun Empire, the mystical sword sect was naturally the Supreme Overlord.</p><p>However, there were a few other sects besides the mystical sword sect. These sects were naturally much weaker than the mystical sword sect, but they were much stronger than some itinerant cultivators or small clans.</p><p>The Flying Cloud sect was such a sect.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Wu Mo’s face turned pale after being berated by a young man in his 20s. However, he didn’t dare to lose his temper at Xu Feiyun.</p><p>He suddenly looked at Lu Ming and said coldly, ” “Kid, why did you shake your head and laugh just now? Are you laughing at me? A little bastard like you dares to laugh at me? I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Then, he struck his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Since he had lost face in front of Xu Feiyun, he would get it back from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold. A sneer hung at the corners of his lips. He looked at Wu Mo’s palm and did not move.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Wu Mo’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“This kid is scared silly.”</p><p>One of the three Yin mountain ghosts shook his head.</p><p>At this moment, a sword light burst out. The snow-white sword light cut through the air. It was faster and colder than Xu Feiyun’s sword light.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A flash of blood appeared, followed by Wu Mo’s shrill scream.</p><p>“Ah, my hand!”</p><p>Wu mo screamed as he retreated. One of his hands had already disappeared.</p><p>His palm was, of course, cut off by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>Such a fast sword, such a ruthless method.</p><p>The hearts of the people in the hall trembled. They all looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>He looked like he was only 15 or 16 years old, but he was able to cut off Wu Mo’s palm with a single strike. What a terrifying strength.</p><p>“Ah, Who are you? Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Wu mo cried out mournfully.</p><p>“Mystical sword sect, Lu Ming. If you want to take revenge, you can find me at the mystical sword sect. Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“What? The mystical sword sect!”</p><p>The others were all shocked, and then they came to a realization.</p><p>So he was a disciple of the mystical sword sect. No wonder he was so powerful.</p><p>Even Xu Feiyun, who had a proud expression, became honest at this time.</p><p>“A disciple of the mystical sword sect? haha, I admit defeat.”</p><p>Wu mo laughed bitterly.</p><p>To him, the mystical sword sect was a giant. If he did not want to die, he would not be able to seek revenge from Lu Ming in this lifetime.</p><p>Wu mo picked up his broken hand and rushed out of the hall, disappearing from sight.</p><p>“The mystical sword sect?”</p><p>Above the hall, the second elder’s eyes flickered. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>“Haha, so it’s the young hero of the mystical sword sect. I’ve been disrespectful.”</p><p>The white-haired old man cupped his hands and said courteously.</p><p>After that, the others also stood up and cupped their fists.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, returned the greeting, and sat down.</p><p>“Haha, I didn’t think that there would be a hero from the mystical sword sect this time. I didn’t even know that the mystical sword sect had collected the Zhu family’s mission token. But this is even better. We’re even more confident this time. Alright, let’s go.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan laughed.</p><p>The crowd nodded and followed Zhu Chuan out of the Zhu family’s residence.</p><p>Outside, the Zhu family was ready.</p><p>A carriage, dozens of Zhu family guards, and more than ten green scale horses.</p><p>“The one in this carriage is our Zhu family’s eldest miss.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan said.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads and mounted their green scale horses. With Zhu Chuan’s command, the dozens of green scale horses let out a ‘rumble’ and the group headed towards dark blood Mountain.</p><p>Zhu Chuan was with them.</p><p>It was more than ten days ‘journey from the skycrossing city to the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>Everyone hurried during the day and rested at night.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>These three days were very peaceful, because being close to the dark blood Mountain was the most dangerous.</p><p>Because it was close to the dark blood Mountain and the terrain was desolate, there were all kinds of bandits and horse thieves in hiding.</p><p>On the fourth day, late at night.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in a temporary tent, meditating and cultivating.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream was heard. In the quiet night, it was particularly abrupt.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes instantly and dashed out like a gust of wind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>It was obvious that he was not the only one. The others were alarmed as well, and they all rushed towards the source of the sound.</p><p>It was a huge tent, and the carriage of the Zhu family’s eldest miss was parked here.</p><p>Lu Ming, the yin mountain’s three ghosts, Xu Feiyun, and the rest had reached it almost at the same time.</p><p>Outside the tent, a figure was lying on the ground.</p><p>It was the white-haired old man. However, his heart had been pierced by a short spear, and he was no longer breathing.</p><p>Everyone frowned.</p><p>These days, everyone had gotten to know each other. This old man was called Chen Xin, and he used a short spear.</p><p>And now, this old man’s heart had been pierced by his own short spear.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Zhu Chuan rushed over and his expression changed when he saw this.</p><p>“Uncle Fu, what’s going on?”</p><p>Zhu Chuan shouted.</p><p>An old man with a hunched back walked out of the tent. He was trembling as he said, ” “Second elder, I don’t know what’s going on. Just now, I suddenly heard a scream and was so scared that I didn’t dare to come out to check. Then, you came.”</p><p>there are almost no traces of a fight here. Although Chen Xin’s cultivation isn’t very high, he is at the peak of the fifth grade master realm. Who could make Chen Xin so defenseless that he could kill him with his own short spear? ”</p><p>The leader of the yin mountain three ghosts said with a grave expression.</p><p>The others were also frowning and thinking.</p><p>“Could it be the Zhou family?”</p><p>Zhu Chuan’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>“Zhou family? what Zhou family?”</p><p>Xu Feiyun asked.</p><p>“This … “I won’t hide it from you all. Our Zhu family has an arch-enemy, the Zhou family. The Zhou family and the Zhu family have been fighting openly and secretly for decades. Both of them want to destroy each other. This time, if the Zhou family knows that the ancestor of our Zhu family is seriously injured, they might send someone to stop us from escorting the pills.”</p><p>Zhu Chuan explained.</p><p>“There’s such a thing? Second elder Zhu, your Zhu family didn’t mention this when you issued the mission, and now you’ve added a week out of nowhere? No, I think this mission still needs to be discussed.”</p><p>The leader of the yin mountain three ghosts said with a changed expression.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Xu Feiyun also nodded.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
