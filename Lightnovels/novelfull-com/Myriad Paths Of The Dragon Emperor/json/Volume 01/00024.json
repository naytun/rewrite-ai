It had the blood meridian of a demonic beast and was undoubtedly strong as it was able to travel 1,500 kilometers in a single day.</p><p>More than ten days later, the weary Lu Ming and Qiu Yue arrived at the Mystical Sword City which was only 25 kilometers away from the Mystical Sword Sect. It was the nearest city to the school and was unbelievably bustling with activity.</p><p>...</p><p>Both its population and size were over ten times larger than that of the Fiery Wind City.</p><p>With merchant groups coming and going from various places in the Blazing Sun Empire, it was a busy area. The main streets were wide enough to fit ten beast carriages in a row while the side of the streets was lined with shops. Indeed, it was a lively scene.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s and Qiu Yue’s first time in such a large city. They were scanning all around them with burning curiosity like two villagers who had just entered the city.</p><p>After strolling around for half a day, their stomachs started to rumble. The duo found themselves a restaurant and entered the building.</p><p>The restaurant was three stories tall with an elegantly decorated interior. They proceeded to the third floor where almost half of the tables were already occupied. Everyone’s eyes sparkled the moment Lu Ming and Qiu Yue arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming had a slender build with distinct features. He donned a fitting garb that accentuated his heroic figure. On the other hand, Qiu Yue had a graceful body and a youthful face. They seemed like a perfect couple when walking together.</p><p>Two young men were seated at one of the tables. Out of the two, one of them wore a brocade garb with a jade belt hanging at his waist. He looked like he was around eighteen years old, and he carried the air of a young prince.</p><p>The other person was around the same age, but he was skinny and was dressed like a servant.</p><p>The moment the youth in the brocade garb laid his eyes on Lu Ming and Qiu Yue, his eyes lit up. To be more precise, he was staring at Qiu Yue with shining eyes.</p><p>However, his eyes flashed with murderous intent when his eyes shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>“A fresh flower on a heap of sh*t!” the young man murmured.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue did not pay any attention to the gazes of the people around them. After they found themselves a table beside a window, they ordered a few dishes as well as a jar of wine and started to chow down.</p><p>“Young Master, the Mystical Sword City sure is crowded!” said Qiu Yue as she looked at Lu Ming’s misty eyes. Her cheeks were pink as she lifted her cup and took a sip from it.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his drink and downed it too. “That’s right. There are only two days left before the Mystical Sword Sect’s annual recruitment day. Every young talent in almost 2,000 cities from the eastern side of the Blazing Sun City has come.”</p><p>At that moment, the young man in the brocade garb lifted his cup and approached them with the thin youth behind him.</p><p>“Young lady, my name is Wei Ziming. May I have the honor of knowing your name? I hope that you’ll grant me the privilege of drinking with me,” he said, raising his cup. However, he did not bother to conceal his gleaming eyes that were scanning every inch of Qiu Yue’s body while completely ignoring Yu Ming.</p><p>Qiu Yue instantly felt slightly uncomfortable with the way Wei Ziming was staring at her. She felt a tinge of disgust as she said, “I’m sorry. I just drank a moment ago, so I don’t feel like it now!”</p><p>Rejected by Qiu Yue right off the bat, Wei Ziming’s face immediately darkened.</p><p>“Wretched girl, what do you mean? My young lord asked you to drink with him because he thinks highly of you. Don’t throw away the privilege that’s been given to you!” the thin youth beside Wei Ziming shouted before he snapped his head towards Lu Ming. “Why are you still sitting there, kid? You’d best scram now. My young master wants that seat.”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. The two men were really on their high horses. He had not even uttered a word, yet they already wanted him gone.</p><p>“Where did these yapping mutts come from?” Lu Ming said in an icy tone as he lifted his cup and took another sip.</p><p>“How dare you speak to me like that, brat!? You’re courting death!” the thin youth yelled with a nasty expression on his face. He lunged towards Lu Ming’s throat with his fingers curled like an eagle’s claw.</p><p>His incomparably sharp fingers whistled through the air as he went for a killer move instantly. If he managed to grab Lu Ming’s throat, it would definitely be crushed.</p><p>He was overbearingly high-handed. Despite being merely a servant, he wanted someone dead just because of a single disagreement.</p><p>“You’re merely a Second Grade Warrior Realm. Scram!” Lu Ming shouted with a simple lash of his palm.</p><p>The palm advanced later than the claws, but it was the first move to connect. It landed squarely on the thin youth’s face, and he yelped in pain as he was blasted away. Soon, he landed heavily on the floor.</p><p>Startled, the other people in the restaurant started to whisper to themselves.</p><p>“Who’s this kid? He has the guts to hit Wei Ziming’s henchman. How daring!”</p><p>“Wei Ziming is the eldest son of the superior city, the Guardian Flame City’s Lord. This kid is done for.”</p><p>“I bet that the kid doesn’t even know where Wei Ziming comes from, or he wouldn’t have dared to hit Wei Ziming’s servant. After all, you have to check it before you wreck it.”</p><p>1</p><p>The discussion around Lu Ming drifted into his ears.</p><p>He suddenly came to see the light. The duo was from the Guardian Flame City. It was no wonder that they were so arrogant.</p><p>There were over 10,000 cities in the Blazing Sun Empire that had different levels based on their respective levels of power. The levels were mainly categorized as Inferior, Mediocre, and Superior.</p><p>The Fiery Wind City was considered as an Inferior city, one which most people had probably never heard of. However, the Guardian Fire City was a Superior city with massive power whose name was famous across all of the Blazing Sun Empire.</p><p>“Ah! How dare you hit me, brat?! You’re dead, you’re dead!” the thin youth started to yell in a frenzy.</p><p>Wei Ziming’s face turned another shade darker as his eyes glimmered with the cold intent of murder. “Brat, do you know I’m the young master of the main family in the Guardian Flame City?” he boasted as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I just found out.” Lu Ming calmly replied.</p><p>“Oh? So, you just found out, but I suppose it’s not too late. Now, kneel and apologize to me. After that, slap yourself 30 times, leave this lady behind, and scram. Then, I’ll consider letting you off,” Wei Ziming said confidently. He believed that Lu Ming would definitely agree to do this after learning who he was.</p><p>However, he was stunned at the very next moment because Lu Ming merely glanced at him and said dully, “I thought your mutt was the only dumb one. Turns out you’re even duller than he is. Get out of my sight this instant, or I’ll send you flying too.”</p><p>Everyone else in the eatery was dead silent. Wei Ziming was a wild one, but who would have thought that Lu Ming was even worse!?</p><p>“Brat! You’re courting death for challenging me!”</p><p>Furious, Wei Ziming stretched his palm out to slap Lu Ming’s face. His palm contained an immense amount of Essential Qi, unquestionably bearing the cultivation of Fifth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming caught him by the wrist even before his palm could connect.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The sound of bones cracking could then be heard followed by Wei Ziming letting out a bloodcurdling scream in pain.</p><p>“Ah! My hand! Release my hand, you good-for-nothing! I’ll make sure you have a tombless death!” Wei Ziming howled in fury.</p><p>2</p><p>Slap!</p><p>At that second, Lu Ming slapped him square in the face, halting Wei Ziming mid-howl.</p><p>Wei Ziming stared at him incredulously with wide eyes as though he had been slapped silly. He never expected that Lu Ming would actually dare to slap him.</p><p>“I said, if you don’t scram now, I’ll send you flying too!” Lu Ming’s calm voice repeated, then…</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Another slap rang out, landing on the other side of Wei Ziming’s face. By then, his face was bloated like a pig’s.</p><p>Lu Ming released a surge of Essential Qi and threw Wei Ziming towards the stairs. “Get lost or I’ll break your limbs,” he threatened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
