Everyone stared in shock as they struggled to comprehend what they had just seen.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming had killed Ning Feng in front of Ning Kong, totally disregarding Ning Feng’s threats.</p><p>He was extremely reckless and insufferably arrogant.</p><p>Many senior apprentices gazed at Lu Ming, and fear trickled down their spines.</p><p>What a savage. Lu Ming was brutally savage towards his enemies and was equally savage toward himself.</p><p>“Feng’er! Little b*stard, I’ll chop you into a thousand million pieces!” Ning Kong was red with rage as he thrashed around like a ferocious, angered beast.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>As he continued to fight Mu Lan, waves of pressure lapped everywhere. The booming sounds were so loud that they threatened to deafen the ears. Those with lower cultivation levels staggered backward. Their faces paled as the resounding booms injured them.</p><p>“He wanted to kill me, so he should’ve been prepared to be killed,” Lu Ming spoke quietly.</p><p>“You little b*stard, how could you compare to Feng’er? If Feng’er wanted to kill you, you should’ve let him! How dare you retaliate? How dare you fight back? How dare you kill Feng’er? I’ll skin you alive and break all your bones!” Ning Kong was blind with rage as he continued to fight.</p><p>“Ning Kong, how dare you disregard the sect rules?” Mu Lan seethed.</p><p>“What sect rules? What bloody sect rules? Can it compare to my Feng’er?” Rage flowed through Ning Kong’s veins like lava as it completely consumed him.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He had nothing to say to people like this. He then looked up into the skies and muttered, “It’s time to step in now, don’t you think?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming was done, a voice bellowed from above, “Are you crazy, Ning Feng? Stop this at once!”</p><p>A Silver-robed Elder appeared in the skies, pressed his hand down mid-air, and a tremendous pressure suppressed Ning Feng immediately.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ning Feng was helpless under that tremendous pressure. He was immediately pressed down flat on the ground, and no matter how he struggled, he could not move an inch.</p><p>“It’s a Silver-robed Elder!”</p><p>“A Silver-robed Elder was watching all along!”</p><p>All other apprentices yelped in surprise when they saw the elderly man.</p><p>“Elder Liu, you’ve gotta give me justice! This little b*stard Lu Ming killed Feng’er!” Ning Kong raged.</p><p>“Battles on the Vermillion Bird Stage are battles to the death. Since it’s a battle to the death, how is Lu Ming wrong? You, on the other hand, Ning Kong, how dare you openly disregard sect rules? The longer you live, the more unreasonable you become. Follow me back now, face a wall, and think of how wrong you are! If you can’t think of any faults, don’t come out.”</p><p>With a wave, a formidable force was emitted from the Silver-robed Elder and it swept Ning Kong off his feet. Both of them transformed into a shooting star, disappearing from sight.</p><p>After the Silver-robed Elder took Ning Kong with him, Lu Ming smiled. He had not exactly killed Ning Feng in front of Ning Kong recklessly and without thought.</p><p>Firstly, Ning Feng kept finding fault with him and sent people to kill him, so Ning Feng deserved to die. If Lu Ming were to spare his life, more trouble would come his way.</p><p>Secondly, Lu Ming knew that there would be Silver-robed Elders watching nearby.</p><p>He exhibited his talents, potential, and worth through this battle. As a month-old new apprentice, Lu Ming was capable of killing a Seventh Grade Master Realm senior apprentice. The higher management of the Vermillion Bird Hall would definitely appreciate such talents.</p><p>So, how would they have allowed Ning Kong to kill him? Even without Mu Lan, Ning Kong would have still failed to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Things were as Lu Ming predicted.</p><p>“Thank you for helping Lu Ming, Elder Mu Lan!” Lu Ming cupped his fist to thank Mu Lan.</p><p>“You’re not bad.” Mu Lan smiled.</p><p>“I’ll make a move now then.” Lu Ming nodded as he got down from the Vermillion Bird Hall and disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>News about Ning Feng and Lu Ming’s duel spread like wings in the Vermillion Bird Hall and across the other Halls.</p><p>Lu Ming could not care less. He went back to his dorm right away and sat in a lotus position.</p><p>Waves of pain came from his body as he smiled bitterly. He had been badly injured in the duel.</p><p>When Ning Feng’s fighting abilities increased drastically after he ate the Spirit-exploding Pill, Lu Ming was injured when he tried his best to block Ning Feng’s attacks.</p><p>Later, Lu Ming tackled Ning Feng head-on after he exploded his blood meridian. Even after devouring 50% of the attack, the remainder injured Lu Ming even more.</p><p>“I guess I’ll have to buy a defensive spiritual weapon like soft armor or something. I’ll also have to cultivate some defensive martial arts technique, or I’ll keep getting hurt like that,” Lu Ming uttered sourly.</p><p>Even if his exploded blood meridian was extremely powerful, he could still be injured by forcefully taking on attacks head-on. His body was too weak. Other than the protective Essential Qi, Lu Ming had no other way of protecting his body.</p><p>‘I’ll treat my injuries first!’</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and started cultivating the True War Dragon Technique to activate his blood meridians so that he could treat his injuries.</p><p>Whoosh…Whoosh…</p><p>Spiritual energy gathered into a vortex shape and gushed towards him at an alarming speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual energy absorption rate was at least two times faster since his blood meridian had advanced to the Fourth Level.</p><p>It was far beyond the speed of the Fifth Level Blood Meridian. It was about the speed of a Seventh Level Blood Meridian, Lu Ming reckoned.</p><p>This was an astonishing speed indeed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming needed nine times more ordinary Essential Qi to cultivate the Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, so by absorbing spiritual energy alone, his cultivation speed still could not compare to Fifth Level blood meridian geniuses.</p><p>Spiritual energy continued to gather and transformed into pure Essential Qi, trickling into Lu Ming’s muscles, bones, and intestines, nourishing and repairing him and healing his injuries.</p><p>After five hours of cultivation, Lu Ming opened his eyes. He felt a lot better and would be completely healed in two days.</p><p>“Hmm? Smells good!”</p><p>A delicious roast meat aroma wafted in from outside.</p><p>“Who’s roasting meat outside?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door curiously and made his way outside.</p><p>In the yard, Pang Shi and Hua Chi were roasting meat.</p><p>Pang Shi was overjoyed when he saw Lu Ming and said. “Senior Brother Lu Ming, you’re done cultivating! Come now, let’s eat! This is Blood Antelope meat. It’s delicious and good for injured people since it helps replenish Qi and blood.”</p><p>Lu Ming was touched. “Did you guys prepare this for me, Pang Shi? Blood Antelope meat isn’t cheap..”</p><p>“I could never afford it,” Pang Shi scratched the back of his head sheepishly and said, “Mr. Starry-eyed bought all these just for you. I used to hunt, so I’m good at roasting meat. Therefore, my task is to roast meat.”</p><p>Hua Chi commented stoically, “Don’t you misunderstand, Lu Ming. I didn’t do this just to help you heal because I’ll definitely defeat you. If you had any repercussions from your current injuries, what fun would it be for me?”</p><p>“What a sharp tongue!” Pang Shi pursed his lips.</p><p>“Hey, Big Stone, don’t call me starry-eyed! I’m warning you,” Hua Chi barked.</p><p>“But…that’s your name! How else should I address you?” Pang Shi was confused.</p><p>“You…” Hua Chi stuttered.</p><p>“Haha!” Lu Ming chuckled and bit into a gleaming golden brown piece of roast meat. It was tender and fragrant, absolutely top-notch, and very mouthwatering.</p><p>After he swallowed it, a wave of calming warmness flooded the entire body.</p><p>The Blood Antelope, which was a Fifth Grade Second Level demonic beast, was tender, juicy, and replenished one’s health, so it was extremely beneficial for the injured.</p><p>CREATORS’ THOUGHTS</p><p>Riise</p><p>From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren’t selected will be refunded within 30 days.
