Furthermore, body-tempering cultivation techniques were known for being difficult and slow to cultivate.</p><p>By cultivating a body-tempering technique, one’s body would constantly become stronger and possess all sorts of unbelievable abilities.</p><p>According to the strength of the body, the body was divided into nine grades.</p><p>Rank-1 was the weakest and rank-9 was the strongest. There were three levels: lower tier, upper tier, and peak tier.</p><p>However, the path of body refinement wasn’t a single path. It was a type of martial Dao, a supplementary type. Just like the path of inscription, it supplemented the martial Dao.</p><p>This was because if one’s physical body wasn’t combined with martial arts, one wouldn’t be able to unleash the power it should have.</p><p>For example, the first-grade physical body was not corresponding to the martial warrior realm.</p><p>Without genuine Qi and all kinds of martial arts techniques, the body alone was just an empty force. A grade one body was no match for a warrior realm martial artist.</p><p>Even if he had a second-grade body, he was no match for a martial warrior.</p><p>However, this did not mean that one’s body was weak and cultivation was useless.</p><p>Body refinement was an auxiliary to martial arts.</p><p>Once a strong body, genuine Qi, and various martial arts techniques were combined, an unimaginable power would burst out.</p><p>It wasn’t as simple as one plus one equals two, but it was an exponential increase.</p><p>For example, the stronger one’s physical body was, the more true energy one could unleash without any restraint, without having to worry about harming one’s body.</p><p>Some powerful martial skills and even secret skills were very harmful to the body. Without a strong body, one could not withstand them.</p><p>Furthermore, the stronger one’s physical body was, the more incredible one’s abilities would be.</p><p>The stronger one’s physical body was, the stronger one’s vitality and recovery rate would be. Even if one was injured, one would be able to recover very quickly.</p><p>It was said that when one’s physical body was strong enough, one could control the muscles, bones, and bones of the entire body. They could control every single strand of muscle, and they could instantly seal the wound when they were injured.</p><p>He could also control his muscles and bones to change his shape and appearance. It was extremely wonderful.</p><p>If he was stronger, he could even regrow a severed limb or even regrow a drop of blood. Of course, these were just legends.</p><p>Therefore, the path of body refinement existed to support the path of martial arts. When combined with martial arts, it could produce a powerful force.</p><p>Zheng Zha was a good example.</p><p>He did not cultivate black level martial arts techniques, but his physical body was much stronger than Lu Ming’s. With a yellow level upper level martial arts technique, he could burst out with strength that could compete with Lu Ming.</p><p>This was especially true for some close-combat martial artists who cultivated palm, fist, and claw techniques. If they combined it with a strong body, their strength would increase to a terrifying level.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly opened the flaming Vajra art and read it.</p><p>After watching it, Lu Ming fell into deep thought.</p><p>“The blaze Titan art can at most allow one to cultivate a third-grade body. From the looks of it, Zheng should have only cultivated to the great circle of first grade, not second grade.”</p><p>that’s enough. If I can cultivate a third-grade body, my strength will increase by at least a few times.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gradually lit up.</p><p>This wasn’t just for show. As a martial artist’s cultivation level increased, their true Qi would also slowly temper their physical body, making it stronger.</p><p>However, the process was too slow. It was said that once one reached the martial arts Grandmaster realm, one’s physical body would naturally improve to the first grade.</p><p>However, that was not enough to satisfy the needs of a martial artist.</p><p>The stronger one’s cultivation was, the stronger and more condensed one’s genuine Qi would be. The pressure on one’s meridians and physical body would also be stronger. Therefore, when a martial artist fought, he would subconsciously retain a part of his genuine Qi to protect his meridians and physical body.</p><p>Usually, one could unleash one hundred percent of one’s strength, but in the true sense, one couldn’t even unleash one hundred percent of one’s strength. It was already good enough to unleash eighty percent.</p><p>However, only after his body became strong could he not have any worries and be able to unleash all his true Qi.</p><p>This was especially true for Lu Ming. His essential Qi was too strong and condensed. Hence, he subconsciously left more essential Qi to protect his meridians and physical body.</p><p>Therefore, to Lu Ming, this flaming Vajra art was more important than the black level martial arts technique.</p><p>Lu Ming put down the book after carefully studying the cultivation method of the ‘flaming Vajra art’. He looked at the fifth and last book.</p><p>This book was not a cultivation technique or a battle technique, but a notebook.</p><p>It was found in Zheng’s storage ring.</p><p>After flipping through it, the first few pages were of no importance to Lu Ming. He skipped through them and flipped through more than ten pages. He found a few pages that had been marked before he saw the one that Lu Ming was interested in.</p><p>These were the records of the extinct volcano.</p><p>“So that dormant volcano contains fire spirit milk, which is extremely useful for training the flaming Vajra Arts. So the treasure Zheng is looking for is fire spirit milk.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up after reading it.</p><p>Initially, the progress of the body tempering technique was extremely slow. Lu Ming did not expect to cultivate the flaming Vajra Arts to a profound level in a short period of time. It would not be of much use in a short period of time.</p><p>However, it would be different if he had the fire spirit milk. He might be able to master the raging flame Vajra Arts in a short time.</p><p>He did not need much. As long as he could cultivate a first-grade body, it would be of great help to Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“Let’s go. Since we know, we can’t miss this!”</p><p>After tidying up his things, Lu Ming had an idea. He left the Supreme shrine and headed towards the central region, back to the vicinity of the extinct volcano.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The roars of demonic beasts rang out. Five or six demonic beasts held the corpses of the ten directions sword sect disciples in their mouths and ran away.</p><p>It must have been the smell of blood that attracted the demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and went to the path that the stone hunters the disciples of the omnipresent sword sect had asked to explore.</p><p>There was a white powder mark here, and the outline of the road could be clearly seen.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself for a moment and then stepped forward.</p><p>He didn’t walk very quickly. He circulated his true Qi throughout his body and observed the ground with all his attention.</p><p>The terrain in this area was constantly changing. Just because it was fine before didn’t mean it was fine now.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no accidents along the way. Lu Ming successfully passed this section of the road.</p><p>After walking through this path, they would reach the foot of the dead volcano.</p><p>There were thick piles of black rocks here, and they were very stable, so there was no need to worry about any flames or lava spurting out.</p><p>Lu Ming climbed up. The extinct volcano was not tall, only a few hundred meters. Very soon, Lu Ming reached the top.</p><p>In the middle of the mountain peak was a huge hole that was hundreds of meters deep. Below it was a black crystal that was as black as ink.</p><p>According to the Zheng family’s ancient records, the fire spirit milk was right below this volcano.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming climbed down slowly along the walls.</p><p>Soon, he climbed down the extinct volcano and reached the bottom.</p><p>The black crystals below were extremely hard, and inside the wall of the extinct volcano, there was a deep pit.</p><p>In the pit, Lu Ming saw a spiritual herb at a glance.</p><p>This spiritual herb was fiery red and emitted a crystal-like luster.</p><p>“Flame crystal grass!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see the spiritual herb.</p><p>This was one of the materials needed to cultivate the third level of the true war Dragon technique. Lu Ming had come to the Lingnan fire field with the intention of finding the flame crystal grass.</p><p>It was a pity that he had never found it, but he did not expect to find it here.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
