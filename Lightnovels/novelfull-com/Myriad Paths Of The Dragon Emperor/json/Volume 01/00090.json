This scene was truly terrifying.</p><p>When the other stone hunters saw this, they were so scared that they couldn’t stop trembling.</p><p>However, the disciples of the ten directions Sword School were very calm, even cold.</p><p>“Mark the places you just passed.”</p><p>Among the ten direction sword sect disciples, a dark-skinned young man with a cold expression ordered.</p><p>This cold-looking young man was the Shifang sword sect’s senior brother Zheng, Zheng ke.</p><p>He didn’t even look at the stone hunters. In his eyes, these stone hunters were just ants, tools to be used.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the extinct volcano in front of him.</p><p>according to the records left by our ancestors, this is the place. I must get the fire spirit milk. As long as I get the fire spirit milk, my physical body will definitely be able to cultivate to the second grade. In that case, my strength will increase greatly, and I will definitely be able to win ten consecutive battles on the bronze platform and enter the bronze list.</p><p>“It’s not just breaking through to the second grade, it’s even going to reach a higher level. Three hundred years ago, our ancestor got the fire spirit milk here. Now that three hundred years have passed, there must be a lot of fire spirit milk. If there is enough, it’s not entirely impossible to break through to the third grade. Haha, in that case, how much can my combat strength improve?”</p><p>Zheng Qian thought fanatically.</p><p>“Yes, senior brother Zheng!”</p><p>yes! the Shifang sword sect disciple replied. Then, he threw out balls of white powder and scattered them on the spot where the burly man had just passed, forming a safe path.</p><p>“Now, you, go and Scout the path.”</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions Sword School pointed at a young man in his twenties.</p><p>The young man’s face instantly turned pale. His face was filled with despair and cold sweat. He cried out, ” “I beg you, please let me go. I beg you.”</p><p>ah hai, young heroes, I beg you to let ah hai go. Let me take his place. He’s still young!</p><p>A white-haired old man walked out and knelt on the ground, kowtowing non-stop.</p><p>“Grandpa, don’t! You can’t go!”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>let me do it, let me do it. I beg you to let ah hai go. He’s still young!</p><p>The old man didn’t seem to hear the young man’s words and continued to kowtow.</p><p>“Oh? What a loving grandfather-grandson pair. Alright, this young master will be lenient. Old man, you go Scout the way!”</p><p>A flat-nosed disciple from the ten directions sword sect waved his hand and said.</p><p>“Grandpa, Grandpa, don’t go.”</p><p>The young man’s tears flowed down as he shouted.</p><p>ah hai, I’m already old. It doesn’t matter anymore, but you must live on.</p><p>The old man warned the young man, and then walked forward without looking back.</p><p>The young man looked on in despair.</p><p>The burly man from before had passed through the first two hundred meters. It was very safe, and the old man had passed through smoothly.</p><p>At this point, the old man carefully avoided the place where the lava had spurted out and continued forward.</p><p>However, before he had even walked 100 meters, the ground suddenly split open when the old man stomped his foot. The old man fell straight down.</p><p>Then, there was a shrill scream, and after a few breaths, there was no sound.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>The young man let out a desperate roar.</p><p>The other stone hunters were even more flustered, their faces pale.</p><p>“Make a mark!”</p><p>Zheng continued to order.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Balls of white powder were thrown out, marking the safe Routes and the dangerous places.</p><p>“You, it’s your turn, go up!”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple pointed at the young man from before.</p><p>The young man’s expression changed drastically. just now, just now, ” he cried out. my grandfather has already taken my place. You … Why are you still asking me to go?”</p><p>“Replace you? I never said that he was going in your place. He was the one who requested to go first, so of course I have to satisfy him. Now it’s your turn.”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple from the ten directions sword sect said coldly with a playful expression on his face.</p><p>The other disciples of the ten directions sword sect looked on indifferently.</p><p>“No, no, you can’t do this, you can’t do this, I won’t go, I won’t go.”</p><p>The young man kept shaking his head and shouting.</p><p>The other stone hunters kept quiet out of fear. They did not dare to say a word for fear of being noticed by the disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>“You’re not?”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple’s face turned cold, and he grinned hideously. “You don’t want to go, right? if you don’t want to go, I’ll send you on your way now to accompany your dead Grandpa.”</p><p>He waved his sword and a cold killing intent enveloped the young man’s body.</p><p>The young man’s eyes were filled with fear. In the end, he still trembled and moved forward.</p><p>After the young man walked a few dozen meters forward, he suddenly started to escape to the side.</p><p>“You want to escape? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple shouted and exhaled. He held his sword with both hands and slashed down at the young man who had escaped.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi shot out and instantly crossed dozens of meters, cutting the young man in half.</p><p>I’ve said it before. If you obediently go and explore the path, you might still have a chance to live. If you want to escape, the only path is death.</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple of the ten directions sword sect sneered. He then pointed and said,”You, go Scout the path.”</p><p>Those who were pointed at walked out in despair, trembling as they moved forward, hoping that they were lucky enough to reach the end.</p><p>But the result was still death.</p><p>Just like that, one by one, they picked up the stones and went forward to explore the way. One by one, they died in the fire and lava.</p><p>However, the safe route was slowly being discovered.</p><p>The closer one got to the extinct volcano, the more dangerous it was, and the more unstable the underground was.</p><p>More than a dozen of the thirty stone hunters had died in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, they were still about 100 meters away from the extinct volcano.</p><p>He called a few more people to investigate, and finally, a complete and safe path appeared.</p><p>“Young heroes, can we go now?”</p><p>One of the remaining stone hunters asked in a low voice.</p><p>“Leave? Where to? The information here can not be leaked out.”</p><p>Zheng, who hadn’t spoken the entire time, spoke.</p><p>“What … What? What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>The stone Hunter’s face changed.</p><p>“What do you mean? All of you will die!”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple of the ten directions sword sect laughed sinisterly.</p><p>no, no, you said that as long as you found a safe path, you would let us go. You can’t do this. You are disciples of the ten directions Sword School. You can’t go back on your word.</p><p>“I’m begging you!”</p><p>no, I don’t want to die. I curse you to die a horrible death!</p><p>More than ten stone hunters had already had hope, but at this time, their faces were filled with despair and they started to shout crazily.</p><p>“Curse us? You all know that we are disciples of the ten direction Sword School. Who would dare to kill us?”</p><p>The flat-nosed disciple of the ten directions sword sect sneered.</p><p>“Eh? There’s a person there, walking towards us.”</p><p>Suddenly, a disciple of the ten directions Sword School shouted.</p><p>The rest of the people couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>From the right, a young figure was walking towards them.</p><p>The figure was about 15 or 16 years old. He had a slender figure and a delicate face. However, his eyes were extremely cold, so cold that it was terrifying.</p><p>This young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
