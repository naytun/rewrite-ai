As long as he avoided the physical attacks of the long sword and the saber, he would be fine.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Streams of sword Qi, saber Qi, and fist force all landed on Lu Ming’s body. However, Lu Ming’s body only swayed slightly, and he continued to slash out with the star sword.</p><p>The lustrous sword technique was extremely fast, and he slashed dozens of times in an instant.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Screams rang out continuously as seven to eight figures were sent flying. All of them were heavily injured and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a frenzy. The essential Qi in his body was so condensed that it was almost tangible, and it burst out continuously.</p><p>His Blood Meridian level was currently at level four, and the time for his Blood Meridian to burst out was only five breaths.</p><p>In these five breaths, he was extremely powerful.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Heavenly Star sword kept slashing out, and the screams continued. One figure after another kept flying out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The disciples of the Tribunal Council were like sandbags as they fell to the ground one after another.</p><p>The surrounding disciples of the four courtyards were so shocked that their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“Monster, monster, isn’t lu Ming too powerful? How long has he been in the sect!”</p><p>“And did you guys see that? He actually ignored the attacks!”</p><p>he must have some kind of defensive treasure on him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to withstand so many attacks.</p><p>that’s right. There must be a defensive treasure. Lu Ming is actually not that powerful. He relied on the defensive treasure to catch the law enforcement Hall off guard. Look, he’s injured.</p><p>The senior disciples of the four courtyards were in a heated discussion. Although they felt that Lu Ming must have relied on a defensive treasure, their eyes were still filled with shock.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Five breaths had passed, and more than twenty enforcement Palace’s disciples had been severely injured by him. They were no longer able to fight.</p><p>However, he had taken so many attacks head-on. Even though he had devoured half of the attacks, he was still injured.</p><p>“He’s injured, kill him!”</p><p>The remaining enforcement Hall disciples roared and continued to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A tall and thin young man exchanged a blow with Lu Ming. Lu Ming trembled and could not help but take a step back.</p><p>Ninth grade master realm!</p><p>Finally, a ninth grade master realm expert from the Tribunal Council made his move.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, the rest of the people rushed forward.</p><p>During this entire process, Yao Tianyu had no intention of making a move. He continued to stand at the side, watching coldly.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming was not worthy of him to take action personally.</p><p>Beside Yao Tianyu, there was another young man. He was as strong as an iron tower, but he did not make a move either.</p><p>“So what if you’re a ninth grade master realm? Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming attacked more than ten times in a row, forcing the others to retreat. Then, he fought with the ninth grade master realm expert.</p><p>In an instant, the two exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Teng! “Thump!”</p><p>After a dozen moves, the ninth grade master realm youth’s expression changed drastically and he retreated a dozen steps.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed toward the red-robed young man.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and murderous.</p><p>The red-robed youth was scared out of his wits. So many Tribunal Council experts and they could not stop Lu Ming? how was this possible?</p><p>“Senior brother Yao, save me!” He couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>Yao Tianyu frowned and said, ” “He tie, attack!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Iron Tower-like young man behind him responded, and then he stomped on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground shook, and the hard floor cracked. The Iron Tower youth’s body was shot out like a cannonball.</p><p>Fast, extremely fast. He was even faster than Lu Ming when he used the Dragon serpent steps. He was near Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>He threw a punch, and the violent fist force surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. The Iron Tower young man’s punch gave him an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he used all his true Qi and slashed at the Iron Tower young man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Iron Tower young man’s fist heavily hit the star sword.</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ming felt as if he had been hit by a huge mountain. The force was unstoppable. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming flew more than ten meters before landing on the ground. Then, he took eight steps back. With each step, the floor cracked and rumbled.</p><p>After eight steps, Lu Ming finally stopped and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“He tie, it’s he tie who made a move!”</p><p>he tie is a genius expert who won eight consecutive victories on the bronze platform. He’s not far from the bronze ranking. With him, Lu Ming is doomed this time.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming and he tie are too different.”</p><p>Seeing the Iron Tower youth’s attack, someone cried out in shock.</p><p>“Eight consecutive wins on the bronze platform? It is indeed powerful.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at he tie, who was in front of him, with a grave expression.</p><p>If the disciples of the mystical sword sect wanted to enter the bronze ranking, they had to go up to the bronze platform and accept challenges.</p><p>Only those who won ten consecutive rounds could be ranked on the bronze list.</p><p>He tie, on the other hand, had already won eight matches in a row. He only needed to win two more times in a row before he could enter the bronze rank.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that easy, because the further one went, the more difficult it would be, and the stronger the people they would meet.</p><p>But eight consecutive wins, his strength was also very strong.</p><p>it’s not bad that you can take a punch from me, but I advise you to surrender. You and I are far apart.</p><p>He tie said indifferently.</p><p>haha, if you want to fight, then fight. You want me to surrender without putting up a fight? impossible!</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and laughed.</p><p>“You’re so stubborn!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He tie charged at Lu Ming and threw another punch.</p><p>This punch was even more powerful than the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He did not take the attack head-on. Instead, he used the Dragon serpent steps and dodged to the side.</p><p>“You can’t avoid it.”</p><p>He tie stomped on the ground heavily, causing the floor to crack. He was like a wild beast, charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>He threw another punch.</p><p>It was extremely fast.</p><p>He could not avoid this punch.</p><p>If he couldn’t avoid it, then he would take it head-on.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique to the extreme. His essential Qi surged wildly as he slashed out.</p><p>The Heavenly Star sword and he tie’s fist collided once again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword aura was defeated in an instant. The difference was too great. They were not even on the same level.</p><p>He tie’s combat strength was too strong. Although he was also a ninth grade master, ordinary ninth grade master realm cultivators were trash in front of him. He could defeat them with a single punch.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could definitely fight an ordinary ninth grade master realm expert without activating his Blood Meridian. However, he was still far from he tie.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was sent flying backward. He slid for dozens of meters before he stopped.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. His face was pale and his body was staggering as if he could fall down at any moment.</p><p>“Is this the strength of a true genius of the mystical sword sect? It’s really powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
