This speed was already extremely shocking.</p><p>“This liquid might be extremely poisonous to others, but to me, it’s a treasure. Unfortunately, it’s something that can only be encountered by luck.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered to himself. Then, he opened his mouth and exhaled gently. A beam of air formed and shot out a few meters away like a sharp sword.</p><p>a seventh grade master realm is indeed powerful. He’s so much stronger than a fifth grade master realm. One move is enough for me to fight Ning Feng again.</p><p>Feeling the Dragon-shaped vital energy surging in his body, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Rustle …</p><p>At this moment, a rustling sound could be heard.</p><p>The sound came from the pit, and when he looked closer, he saw a dark red worm crawling in the pit.</p><p>This worm was thicker than a thumb and more than a foot long. Its entire body was crystal clear like blood jade and it had a mouth of sharp fangs.</p><p>At this moment, when he saw Lu Ming, he seemed to be shocked. He twisted his body and quickly darted away.</p><p>“This is … Blood breath bugs!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>According to the ancient records, the blood breath bugs had dark bloodstones as their companions. In other words, the place where the blood breath bugs lived would definitely have dark bloodstones.</p><p>He had not expected that there would be a blood breath bug in the pond.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He rushed over and followed closely behind the blood breath bug.</p><p>When the blood breath bug saw Lu Ming chasing after it, it twisted its body even faster and rushed forward.</p><p>“Do you think it’s that easy to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode forward, following closely behind the blood breath bug.</p><p>After about a thousand meters, the blood breath bug suddenly burrowed into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>not good. The blood breath bugs can dig underground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He rushed over, but the blood breath bugs were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming leaped onto a big tree and scanned his surroundings.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, a hundred meters away, the blood breath bug’s figure emerged from the ground and rushed forward.</p><p>“I can’t chase it too close. This will only disturb it and prevent it from running back to its resting place.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he jumped onto another big tree. He leaped on the trunk, restrained his aura, and followed closely behind the blood breath bugs.</p><p>They crossed over mountains and ridges, and continued for dozens of miles.</p><p>At this time, the blood breath bug stopped again. It burrowed into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>“Could this be the place?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. He was not in a hurry to rush out. Instead, he began to observe.</p><p>After a while, there was still no movement. Lu Ming was certain that this should be the blood breath bugs ‘habitat.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and came to the place where the blood breath bugs disappeared.</p><p>“Looks like it’s here. The dark blood Stone should be right below.”</p><p>Then, he took out the Blackedge sword he used before and used it as a shovel to start digging.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation level and the sharpness of the Blackedge sword, he was able to dig through the Rocky ground at a very fast speed.</p><p>Soon, a pit several meters deep was dug.</p><p>At this moment, a red light shot out with a swish. It was the blood breath bug.</p><p>After the blood breath bug rushed out, it did not stop at all and ran away.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and continued digging.</p><p>Very quickly, a faint fragrance, like that of sandalwood, wafted out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirits were lifted. According to the ancient records, although the dark blood Stone was called the dark blood Stone, it did not have the slightest smell of blood. Instead, it had the fragrance of sandalwood.</p><p>Since this smell was coming out, it meant that there was definitely a dark blood Stone here.</p><p>Lu Ming dug even harder. As a piece of rock was dug up, a rich fragrance filled the air.</p><p>Below him, a stone the size of a fist with blood-red lines all over its body appeared before Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the dark blood Stone.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He took out the dark blood Stone and looked at it carefully.</p><p>This was the true war Dragon technique’s third stage, and even the fourth stage required it.</p><p>He took a look at it and then kept it in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>However, at the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed because the scent of sandalwood was still coming from below.</p><p>“Could there be dark blood stones?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and quickly dug with all his might.</p><p>Sure enough, he didn’t dig too deep before he found another dark blood Stone. It was still the size of a fist, and it emitted a strong sandalwood fragrance.</p><p>“Hahaha, what great luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and took out the dark blood Stone.</p><p>However, there was still the fragrance of sandalwood coming from below.</p><p>“Still … There are more?” This time, even Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed because he heard the sound of air breaking coming from all around.</p><p>“There’s the smell of sandalwood. It’s the dark blood Stone. Hurry up!”</p><p>There was a commotion, and then five or six figures appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the forest, six figures suddenly appeared and surrounded Lu Ming. They did not hide their auras at all. They burst out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Four of them were seventh grade master realm, and two of them were peak sixth grade master realm.</p><p>There were men and women among the six, but they were all very young, about eighteen or nineteen years old.</p><p>At this moment, the six of them were looking at the big pit that Lu Ming had dug with burning eyes.</p><p>“There is indeed a dark blood Stone. Kid, you can get lost now. The dark blood Stone here belongs to us.”</p><p>A young man with an aquiline nose looked at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>“Everyone, I was the first to discover this place.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“So what if you discovered it first? It’s ours now.”</p><p>The hook-nosed young man sneered, his expression full of pride and arrogance.</p><p>so you want to Rob me. Let’s see if you have the ability to do so.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, looking very relaxed.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The hook-nosed youth shouted coldly, then clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Five sharp claw gleams were aimed at Lu Ming’s chest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>There was a loud bang, followed by a cracking sound. Then, the hook-nosed young man let out a shrill scream and retreated a dozen steps. One of his hands trembled and blood kept flowing out.</p><p>His five fingers had been broken by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>“Brat, How dare you! Do you know who we are? We’re disciples of the Azure Dragon Hall of the mystical sword sect. You’re dead for hurting me. My hand!”</p><p>The hook-nosed youth screamed and roared.</p><p>“Azure Dragon Hall disciple? No wonder his cultivation is not weak despite his young age.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“You … I remember now. You are Lu Ming, this year’s newcomer King, Lu Ming! I saw you from afar when the last trial ended.”</p><p>Suddenly, a female disciple shouted.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>The others couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you would still recognize me.”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you’re the newcomer King, I still have to give you a piece of advice. Get out of the way and leave. We can pretend that today’s incident never happened because this dark Bloodstone is something senior brother Yao Tianyu needs. We’re also looking for it under senior brother Yao Tianyu’s orders,”</p><p>The woman said one sentence after another, her tone full of confidence.</p><p>She felt that as long as she mentioned Yao Tianyu’s name, Lu Ming could only get lost obediently.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
