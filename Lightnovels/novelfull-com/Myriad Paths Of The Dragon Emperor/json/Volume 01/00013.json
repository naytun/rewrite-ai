He fixed his gaze on Qiu Yue and Li Ping. “Oh my, you guys are thinking of reporting me to the Elder Council? Such wishful thinking! Spouse of the Lord? Bullsh*t! Once the day is over, Lady Lu Yao will succeed as the Lord. You guys will be nothing then.</p><p>1</p><p>“Let me tell you both, you’ll be soon dealing with this kind of work every day, so you’d best practice right now.”</p><p>“D-don’t even think about it! My Young Master won’t let you have your way!” Qiu Yue’s face was flushed with anger and shouted as she pointed at Duan San.</p><p>“That piece of trash, Lu Ming? Hahaha, you’re actually still expecting that trash to save both of you? Don’t even dream about it! Were it not because I couldn’t find him today, he’d be the one cleaning the toilets right now!”</p><p>Duan San let out an unpleasant sharp laugh. His beady eyes flashed lustfully as he scanned Qiu Yue’s body. “I never thought that you would become so pretty after missing you for some time. How about this, you can come to my room and serve me. If I’m satisfied with your service, I might consider letting you two off on cleaning the toilets!</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!” Qiu Yue’s face turned pale, she subconsciously took two steps back.</p><p>Duan San’s face turned cold. “Don’t even think about it? But I want to do it. Take this girl and bring her to my room.”</p><p>“Roger!” The two muscular men behind Duan San responded.</p><p>“No, don’t! I beg you, Housekeeper Duan, let Qiu Yue go, I will do any chore you ask me to, please just let Qiu Yue go!”</p><p>Li Ping stood in front of Qiu Yue to protect her as she looked at Duan San pleadingly.</p><p>“Scram!” The two muscular men shouted. One of them swung his palm towards Li Ping.</p><p>Right at that moment…</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The courtyard’s door suddenly burst open, sending wood shrapnel flying everywhere.</p><p>It happened so suddenly that the two muscular men stopped their actions. Everyone’s gaze was drawn to the door.</p><p>A young figure stepped into the courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?” You came at the right time, go clean the toilets now.”</p><p>Duan San let out a breath and sneered the moment he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>The youth was indeed Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even glance at Duan San. He walked towards Li Ping in a few steps and asked, “Mother, are you alright?”</p><p>“Mother is fine, Ming’er, why did you come? We can handle this, you should leave quickly,” Li Ping said anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and said, “Mother, I was late, I will never let you experience any unfairness from now on.”</p><p>“Lu Ming! I’m talking to you, trash! Do you hear me?” Duan San sounded behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming slowly turned and glared at Duan San with a gaze that was as cool as ice, as if his eyes were that of a demon from hell. The current situation sparked an incomparable fury inside Lu Ming. It filled his chest and was about to explode at any given time.</p><p>The burning fury turned into chilling murderous intent. An emotionless sentence parted Lu Ming’s lips. “Duan San, you deserve to die!”</p><p>The cold look in Lu Ming’s eyes chilled Duan San’s heart. However, as soon as he remembered that Lu Ming was merely trash, he picked up his courage and glared fiercely. “Lu Ming, how dare you threaten me! You’re courting death! Break his limbs!” he shouted.</p><p>“Roger!” That two muscular men glared ferociously and made a move, grabbing Lu Ming by his arms.</p><p>The two strong men were at the peak of mid Novice Realm.</p><p>“Ming’er!” Li Ping was frightened.</p><p>Duan San could not stop sneering.</p><p>Snap! Snap!</p><p>The sound of bones snapping rang out twice followed by two piercing screams. Duan San froze and it startled Li Ping.</p><p>This was because the screaming came from the muscular men.</p><p>All it took was for Lu Ming to hold on to their wrists, and the bones were ground into powder.</p><p>“Ah! Ah! My hand!” The two muscular men could not stop screaming from the pain.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Essential Qi spewed out and surged into the bodies of the two muscular men. They mumbled for a moment before being sent flying and crashing onto the ground before they even took their last breaths.</p><p>Their organs were severely damaged by Lu Ming.</p><p>Only at that moment did Duan San react to the situation. “Lu Ming, how dare you?! They were under the First Branch Elder, and you dare to kill them?! You’re courting death!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’ll die.”</p><p>Lu Ming scoffed, He took a step forward and threw a punch at Duan San.</p><p>The moment he threw the punch, a wild jet of Essential Qi spurted out and enveloped Duan San.</p><p>The Essential Qi was so strong, Duan San felt as if he was plunged into an icy chasm.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>As he finished his sentence, Lu Ming’s fist landed squarely on Duan San’s belly.</p><p>Duan San cried out in pain. His stout body landed heavily on the ground like a carcass of a pig being thrown out, forming a cloud of dust.</p><p>“Ah, Ah. Lu Ming, if you cripple my cultivation, Miss Lu Yao and the First Branch Elder will never forgive you.” Duan San yelped desperately.</p><p>1</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Duan San and violently stomped on his leg.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Duan San’s foot instantly snapped from the stomp.</p><p>He let out a miserable howl akin to the sound of a slaughtered pig, there were tears and snot flowing down his face.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he gazed at Duan San. “You said you wanted my limbs broken a moment ago. Now, I’m going to break yours.”</p><p>The moment he finished talking, he stomped on Duan San’s other foot and broke its bones as well.</p><p>“Ah! Ah! My leg! Lu Ming, no, Young Master Ming, I beg of you to spare me! The First Branch Elder and Lu Chuan ordered me to do all of this, how would I dare to disobey them!”</p><p>Duan San howled miserably.</p><p>“The First Branch Elder and Lu Chuan?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s glare was icy cold. He then consecutively stomped his foot on Duan San’s arms and instantly broke them, then turned around and walked towards Li Ping and Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Ming’er, is that your cultivation?”</p><p>Right at that moment, Li Ping stared at Lu Ming excitedly as tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>“Mother, your son has experienced a miracle in this period of time. I’ll go into details later, let’s head to the training field now,” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Li Ping’s expression changed. “Ming’er… the training field? The First Branch Elder and Lu Yao are over there, you’d best be not too impulsive!”</p><p>2</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved tremendously over this period of time, was he strong enough to go against Lu Yao?</p><p>Not only did Lu Yao awaken a Fifth Level blood meridian, but she also had marital ties with the Mystical Sword Sect’s Duanmu Family. Li Ping heard that during that period, the Duanmu Family delivered a slew of valuable pills to her while she concentrated on cultivating behind closed doors.</p><p>1</p><p>Naturally, she was worried about Lu Ming.</p><p>A gentle yet confident smile formed on Lu Ming’s lips. “Fret not, mother. Lu Yao will not take the title of Lu Family’s Lord, nor will anyone else. The title belongs to Father, if anyone tries to lay a finger on it, I’ll chop that finger off!”</p><p>“My Lady, don’t worry, Young Master can do it.”</p><p>Qiu Yue agreed.</p><p>The three of them headed towards the Lu Family’s training field.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
