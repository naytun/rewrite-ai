I figured it out by myself!</p><p>Pang Shi laughed heartily. Then, he took out a jar of wine and said, ” “Come on, Lu Ming. This is a medicinal wine bought by a love-struck fool. It’s not harmful to injuries, but you can’t have meat without wine!”</p><p>“Come, then let’s drink to our hearts” content!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>The three of them each had a jar of wine, eating meat in big mouthfuls and drinking wine in big bowls.</p><p>A few hours later, the three of them finished off the blood Antelope.</p><p>The three of them had also finished a few jars of wine.</p><p>Pang Shi and Hua Chi were both drunk.</p><p>Hua Chi’s sour face also disappeared after he got drunk. He put his arm around pang Shi’s shoulder and shouted, ” “You bunch of bastards, I will definitely return in the future. I will kill all of you bastards …”</p><p>senior brother Lu, you’re amazing! pang Shi cried out. I knew you would win. I want to become someone as amazing as senior brother Lu. That way, my parents will be proud of me …</p><p>As the two of them talked, they fell asleep in the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked unsteadily into the room. He then started to circulate the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>After a while, the effect of the alcohol completely disappeared. Lu Ming continued to channel his energy to heal himself.</p><p>The medicinal effects of the blood antelope meat and the medicinal wine circulated throughout his body and Lu Ming’s injuries recovered even faster.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed and Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>After his injuries were healed, Lu Ming did not slack off and continued to cultivate.</p><p>This was because he knew that the dangers and difficulties he would face in the future would only get bigger and bigger.</p><p>Ning Kong and the Duanmu family were mortal enemies. They would definitely not let him off.</p><p>Therefore, he had to improve his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>this way of cultivation is too slow. With my rich and condensed true Qi, it’ll take me at least a year to reach the sixth grade master realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>resources, I’m lacking resources!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Right now, he was penniless. All he had on him was the storage ring that he had obtained from Duanmu Jue.</p><p>Moreover, he still owed Mu Lan 3000 contribution points.</p><p>I have the Supreme shrine, so the storage ring is useless to me. I’ll exchange this storage ring first, then take on some missions and earn some contribution points.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and headed to the contribution Hall.</p><p>This storage ring was only the lowest grade and was worth 150000 taels of silver.</p><p>However, in the contribution Hall, it was only worth one hundred and thirty thousand silver.</p><p>After all, the mystical sword sect had so many disciples that it would require a large amount of resources to operate.</p><p>Therefore, the price of materials and items collected by the contribution Palace was lower than the market price.</p><p>This way, he could earn a difference in price.</p><p>One hundred and thirty thousand taels of silver, all exchanged for contribution points, a total of one thousand three hundred points.</p><p>“Senior, I would like to ask, how many contribution points do I need to view a yellow rank upper level defensive martial arts technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Martial arts? Martial skills can be found in the book collection Hall, but let me tell you, martial skills can only be rented. For a yellow rank upper class defensive martial skill, it would cost at least five thousand contribution points to rent it once.”</p><p>“What? Five thousand contribution points? Isn’t that too expensive?”</p><p>Lu Ming almost jumped up.</p><p>defensive martial skills are much rarer and more precious than offensive martial skills and movement martial skills, so of course they are expensive. If you were to buy them outside, you would need at least a few million taels of silver!</p><p>The old man from the contribution Hall said.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly speechless. However, on second thought, it made sense.</p><p>The Lu clan was such a large clan, but they only had one yellow grade upper level martial arts technique, which was regarded as the clan’s treasure.</p><p>One could only imagine how precious a yellow grade upper level martial arts technique was.</p><p>It seemed like he’d better put defensive martial techniques on hold for now.</p><p>“Senior, are there any defensive soft armors to exchange for?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>of course we have soft armors. However, defensive armors aren’t cheap. What grade do you want to exchange for? ”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“How many contribution points do I need to pay for lower Lv 2 and medium Lv 2 respectively?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>an ordinary lower Lv 2 soft armor costs 800 contribution points, and a medium Lv 2 one costs at least 2000 contribution points.</p><p>“Then I’ll exchange for a lower Lv 2 item!”</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to exchange for a lower second level soft armor.</p><p>However, you get what you pay for. The 800 contribution points were not wasted.</p><p>The red Kylin snake armor was made of the skin of a class 9 Lv 2 demonic beast. It was light, soft, and tough. It didn’t feel like it was inside the clothes.</p><p>After Lu Ming kept the red Kylin snake armor, he walked out of the contribution Hall and headed to the hall of missions.</p><p>He found a place with no one around and changed into a black cloak, covering everyone.</p><p>If he wanted to take on a mission, he had to be on guard against the Duanmu family. If he went out on a mission and the Duanmu family sent a few great Martial Master experts to kill him, he would not be able to fight back.</p><p>There was no harm in being careful.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the hall of missions.</p><p>The hall of missions was the place where the mystical sword sect issued and accepted missions.</p><p>The hall of mission’s missions were roughly divided into two types.</p><p>The first type was missions issued by the mystical sword sect’s disciples and elders, and each mission would give a corresponding reward.</p><p>The other type were missions that were specially collected from outside the mystical sword sect.</p><p>For example, the mystical sword sect would collect all the missions that the Lu family had issued.</p><p>The hall of missions would collect a fee for the completion of the mission.</p><p>The hall of mission was very wide, and it took up even more space than the contribution Hall.</p><p>After walking in, they found themselves in a huge Hall.</p><p>On one side of the hall, there were counters where missions were handed over.</p><p>On the other side, there were a few huge metal walls. These metal walls were made by inscription Masters.</p><p>On the metal wall, there were missions that were constantly rolling.</p><p>The details, time limits, rewards, and so on were clearly written on these missions.</p><p>Lu Ming stood under the screen and watched.</p><p>“Eh? To collect blood Reiki flowers?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a mission that he was rather interested in.</p><p>It was a mission issued by an inscription master of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>He only needed to collect the blood Reiki flowers within three months. The reward was 100 contribution points per blood Reiki flower, the more the better.</p><p>The blood flower was located in the eastern part of the blazing sun Empire and could only be found in the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>Moreover, the price of the blood flower itself was not even 100 contribution points. It seemed that the inscriber was in urgent need of it, which was why he offered such a high price.</p><p>Most importantly, there was a type of dark blood Stone on the dark blood Mountain. It was one of the main materials for cultivating the third stage of the true war Dragon technique. It was even needed for the fourth stage.</p><p>This was the reason why Lu Ming was interested.</p><p>Going to the dark blood Mountain would kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>“Let’s see if there are any other missions.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to read.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
