His Essential Qi flowed freely around him as his hair fluttered.</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s aura did not seem weaker than Ning Feng’s.</p><p>In the duel with Ning Feng just now, Lu Ming had only exerted 50% of his power.</p><p>Now, he was giving it 100%.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>As Lu Ming and Ning Feng’s swords violently collided, sparks flew everywhere. Beams of razor-sharp Sword Qi pierced through the air and shot everywhere.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Both Lu Ming and Ning Feng stumbled a few steps backward after a hit.</p><p>“Damn it! Die!” Ning Feng roared as he attacked Lu Ming once more.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze hardened. His hair was blowing frantically in the wind as a strong fighting intent erupted from his body. He stomped hard and charged towards Ning Feng.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>As Lu Ming and Ning Feng’s attacks continue to collide, there was formidable Sword Qi everywhere as a result of that show.</p><p>It was a few dozen moves in just the blink of an eye. There was no clear winner at that point.</p><p>‘How could this be? Impossible! How is Lu Ming so strong?’ Ning Feng was shocked beyond words.</p><p>He was a Seventh Grade Master Realm, and with his Fifth Stage Superior Yellow Level sword technique that emphasized speed, he could say that his sword was as fast as lightning and as swift as the wind.</p><p>Lu Ming could not only counter his attacks with a similar speed since his Essential Qi was no weaker than Ning Feng’s.</p><p>Little did he know that Lu Ming had cultivated a Divine Level martial arts technique, so his Essential Qi was three times the viscosity of normal Essential Qi.</p><p>At the First Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, Lu Ming could already kill an opponent a Grade higher than he was.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was on the Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, even if Ning Feng was two Grades higher than Lu Ming, he would have still lost to Lu Ming.</p><p>Besides Ning Feng, all the people watching the duel were stupefied.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually come to a tie with a Seventh Grade Master Realm Ning Feng. It was unimaginable.</p><p>Everyone held their breath as they watched the stage intently so as not to disturb the duo fighting on stage.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Ning Feng and Lu Ming continued to fight.</p><p>‘Seventh Grade Master Realm isn’t weak indeed. I can beat him as soon as I explode my blood meridians, but it’s not the time for that yet. Besides, the blood meridian explosion time limit for the Master Realm is two minutes. After two minutes, Ning Feng will be no match for me,’ Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>The two figures on stage intertwined constantly with Sword Qi shooting in all directions. They had exchanged about a hundred attacks by that time.</p><p>Suddenly, the blood-red light on Ning Feng dissipated rapidly. The time limit for his blood meridian explosion was up.</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>On the viewing platform, Ning Kong’s expression changed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Lu Ming and Ning Feng collided once more.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>This time, Ning Feng flew back upon impact. His face paled as blood trickled down the side of his mouth.</p><p>“Ning Feng’s injured!”</p><p>The crowd rose to a clamor as they gawked at the stage.</p><p>“Ning Feng’s blood meridian explosion time is up. It looks like he’s gonna lose.”</p><p>“Unexpectedly, Ning Feng isn’t a match for Lu Ming! How incredible!”</p><p>“Did you realize that Lu Ming’s blood meridian has still not exploded?”</p><p>“What?! I didn’t realize this! It seems like it’s true! How shocking!”</p><p>“Genius! Absolute genius! How is Lu Ming arrogant and conceited? He’s clear and proud of his abilities!”</p><p>All around the Vermillion Bird Stage, fellow elders, seniors, and new apprentices alike were all discussing what had happened chaotically.</p><p>“You can do it, Senior Brother Lu Ming! You’re the best!” Pang Shi waved his arms in the air excitedly while his face was bright red.</p><p>“Mighty Senior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Shortly after, other apprentices started shouting at the top of their lungs.</p><p>These were newly enrolled apprentices. They could not help but feel proud when they saw how strong Lu Ming, their fellow new apprentice, was.</p><p>‘So what if you’re a senior apprentice? We, the new apprentices, can still defeat you!’</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming gained many fans.</p><p>“This fella..” Hua Chi muttered as a sliver of respect crept deep within his eyes. He was usually proud, so when he first met Lu Ming, he had vowed to defeat him.</p><p>However, he realized at that moment that Lu Ming’s talents and potential were not what he could fathom.</p><p>On the viewing platform, Yuan Hui and Feng Wu gaped and gawked.</p><p>Yuan Hui was especially astonished. She had not been pleased when Lu Ming challenged Ning Feng to a duel a month ago. She thought he was being too vain. She understood now that Lu Ming was not arrogant. He was confident and clearly had boasting privileges.</p><p>“Hoho, Ning Kong, it looks like your precious son’s gonna lose.” Mu Lan had a full grin on her face while she giggled.</p><p>“Are you sure? Who’s to determine the outcome of the battle now?” Ning Kong said coldly as he clenched his fists tightly as the intent to kill flashed through his eyes.</p><p>“What…?” A bad feeling rose in Mu Lan’s heart.</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Lu Ming spoke calmly as he looked at Ning Feng, “Ning Feng, your blood meridian explosion time is up. Now, to send you on your way.”</p><p>“Hahaha, you wanna defeat me? Dream on, Lu Ming! You force me to do this!” Ning Feng let out a sinister laugh and popped a pill into his mouth.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A powerful, brutal wave of aura exploded out of Ning Feng as he swallowed the pill. He was two times more formidable than before.</p><p>“Go to hell, Lu Ming!” Ning Feng roared, his eyes turning bloodshot. He stomped so hard that the stage vibrated. Then, he transformed into a gale and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>‘I shouldn’t tackle him head-on!’ Seriousness glinted in Lu Ming’s eyes as he moved out of the way with Dragon Serpent Steps. Unfortunately, he was still too late as Ning Feng’s Sword Qi sliced towards him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked him forcefully with his sword as a gust of brutally sharp force threatened to overwhelm him, causing him to slide backward for ten meters.</p><p>On the viewing platform, Mu Lan shot up from her seat and bellowed furiously, “Spirit-exploding Pill! You’re despicable, Ning Kong! How could you use Spirit-exploding Pills? This duel is no longer just. It ends right now.”</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing, Mu Lan? It’s a battle to the death upon the Vermillion Bird Stage. No one said anything about not allowing pills!” Ning Kong stood up as well, smiling coldly.</p><p>“What battle to the death? It’s no longer fair game if pills are involved,” Mu Lan barked as she attempted to rush onto the Vermillion Bird Stage.</p><p>A great aura erupted from Ning Kong and locked onto Mu Lan. He snickered, “Mu Lan, duels on the Vermillion Bird Stage are battles to the death with no external interruption allowed. Are you gonna go against the sect rules?”</p><p>“Damn it! Despicable!” Mu Lan gritted her teeth while her eyes bulged out. Her movements were locked down by Ning Kong’s aura.</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Ning Feng attacked crazily.</p><p>“Die, Lu Ming! Demonic Wind Sword Technique-World Execution Through Wind!”</p><p>“Demonic Wind Sword Technique-Mad Hurricane Wipe Out!”</p><p>Violent winds of Sword Qi tore through all obstacles and pierced through the air, aiming to hack Lu Ming’s head off.</p><p>‘He’s twice as strong now, so all I can do is just to avoid its cutting edge and look for opportunities to kill him.’ Lu Ming moved quickly with Dragon Serpent Steps as he blocked the Sword Qi attack aimed at him.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming could not stop taking steps backward after Ning Feng’s seven to eight moves. Totally oppressed by Ning Feng, blood trickled down his mouth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
