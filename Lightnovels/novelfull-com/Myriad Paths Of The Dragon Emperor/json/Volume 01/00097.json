He only stopped after three days.</p><p>I’ve completely mastered the force of fire, but the level of fire is still very low. I’ve only just started. In the future, I’ll need to continue cultivating and comprehending it.</p><p>“It’s time to go back. I’ve been in the southern Fire field for more than forty days, and there’s less than a month left before the four-month deadline I promised Feng Wu. I can’t go back on my word. Yao Tianyu, just you wait.”</p><p>Out of habit, Lu Ming searched the surroundings and caught a demonic beast. He rode the demonic beast and quickly headed back to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the mystical sword sect five days later.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’re back.”</p><p>As soon as he entered the dormitory, he ran into pang Shi and Hua Chi, who were walking out together.</p><p>When pang Shi saw Lu Ming, he smiled happily.</p><p>“Big rock, where are you guys going?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, you’re back just in time. There’s going to be a show to watch. Feng fenglie from the Onyx tortoise Hall is going to fight his tenth battle on the bronze platform today. If he wins this battle, there’ll be one more person on the bronze ranking.”</p><p>Pang Shi said excitedly.</p><p>“Feng xinglie? Who is Feng xinglie?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look.</p><p>“No way? Lu Ming, you don’t even know Feng xinglie?”</p><p>Hua Chi looked at Lu Ming in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose with a bitter smile and nodded.</p><p>“Alright, I lose to you.”</p><p>Hua Chi was speechless. He pouted and said, ” Feng xinglie was the rookie King a year ago. Haven’t you heard of him? ”</p><p>“The rookie King from a year ago?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was immediately piqued.</p><p>that’s right. He was the newcomer King from last year. Therefore, this battle is very meaningful. Among the two batches of disciples, the first one started to enter the bronze rank. The others haven’t grown up yet, so it has attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Hua Chi explained.</p><p>After what had happened last time, Hua Chi’s attitude towards him had completely changed. He no longer had a stinky face all day long, shouting that he would defeat him in the future.</p><p>“Interesting. Let’s go together.”</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it. How strong was the newcomer King from a year ago?</p><p>Moreover, he was originally going to the bronze platform.</p><p>The three of them immediately rushed towards the bronze platform.</p><p>The bronze platform was located in the middle of the four great academies. It was a battle platform.</p><p>The bronze platform was surrounded by four huge stands that could accommodate 100000 people.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, the grandstand around the bronze platform was already packed with people. At a rough glance, there were at least tens of thousands of people.</p><p>it’s too lively. So many people have come.</p><p>Pang Shi’s eyes widened as he looked around.</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly amazed.</p><p>There were only about 50000 bronze disciples from the four great academies. This time, no less than 30000 of them had come. It was clear how sensational this was.</p><p>Other than a few who were out on missions or in seclusion, most of the people who knew about the news came.</p><p>The three of them found a place to sit down, and the surrounding people began to discuss.</p><p>“Do you think Feng xinglie will succeed in his challenge? The opponent is also a ruthless person with nine consecutive victories.”</p><p>in my opinion, Feng fenglie will definitely win. He was the new disciple King last year. He’s terrifyingly talented. As the first disciple to enter the bronze rank in the last two batches, he must be very confident.</p><p>“I also think that Feng xinglie will win. Didn’t you see that Feng xinglie had nine consecutive battles yesterday? he won all nine of them. His combat strength is terrifying. I don’t think he has even used his full strength. Ten consecutive wins will definitely not be a problem. What I am more concerned about is whether Feng xinglie will continue to challenge after he wins.”</p><p>“Continue the challenge? Then I’ll have to challenge the geniuses on the bronze rank. If that’s the case, I’ll have a good look today.”</p><p>Not only in this area, but the people around the bronze platform were also discussing this.</p><p>Feng xinglie was the first one to make it to the bronze rank, so he naturally attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Previously, the bronze ranking was filled with genius disciples who had joined the mystical sword sect two years ago.</p><p>For example, Yao Tianyu had joined two years ago.</p><p>“Feng xinglie is here.”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Following that, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>A young man in a yellow shirt was walking toward them from the northern entrance of the bronze platform.</p><p>The young man had an ordinary appearance, but he was very young. He looked to be only sixteen or seventeen years old. With a long sword on his back, he slowly ascended the bronze platform.</p><p>Then, he stood there quietly.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man walked up to the bronze platform.</p><p>This middle-aged man was the elder in charge of managing and presiding over the bronze platform. He was also the judge. He would sort out the situation of the duels on the bronze platform and report it to the sect.</p><p>“Feng xinglie, your opponent today is sun Guang. Sun Guang, please come up the stage.”</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced loudly, his voice reverberating throughout the entire court.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, the sound of air being torn could be heard. A young man of about 18 or 19 years old leaped up a few times and moved as fast as lightning. He was much faster than Lu Ming when he used the Dragon serpent steps at full force. He landed on the bronze platform in an instant, displaying his extremely brilliant movement technique.</p><p>“So fast! With this kind of movement technique, I wouldn’t even be able to react in time if I were to fight him.”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>Sun Guang leaped onto the bronze platform and stood opposite Feng xinglie.</p><p>“Feng xinglie, I didn’t expect it to be a battle between the two of us. Haha, that’s good. As long as I defeat you, I will be able to enter the bronze rank. Although you were the new generation King a year ago and have extraordinary talent, you are still too young. It’s still too early for you to fight me.”</p><p>Sun Guang laughed.</p><p>“Someone said the same thing yesterday, but he couldn’t block my sword.”</p><p>Feng xinglie’s calm voice came out of his mouth. He seemed very confident.</p><p>Sun Guang’s face suddenly darkened.</p><p>I believe that everyone is aware of the rules of the bronze platform. However, I would like to re-explain the rules here. On the bronze platform, one is responsible for one’s own life and death. However, as long as one person admits defeat, the battle will end. The other person is not allowed to continue attacking. If one violates this rule, all results will be canceled.</p><p>also, you can use any means except for pills and other drugs to increase your combat strength. Now, the battle begins.</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced loudly and then stepped aside.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, sun Guang’s body flashed and he charged towards Feng xinglie. He was even faster than when he was on the stage.</p><p>“Moon Shadow Light splitting sword, slash!”</p><p>When he was 10 meters away from Feng xinglie, sun Guang jumped up high and swung his sword. A dense, crescent-shaped sword Qi slashed towards Feng xinglie.</p><p>“What a powerful sword technique. This is definitely the sixth level of a yellow grade upper level martial arts technique.”</p><p>Someone near Lu Ming could not help but cheer.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered slightly. He could tell that sun Guang had not only cultivated the yellow level upper class sword technique to the sixth level, but his body technique was also at the sixth level of the yellow level upper class body technique.</p><p>Furthermore, his cultivation was at the peak of the ninth grade master realm. With the addition of his bloodline, his combat strength could not be said to be weak.</p><p>An existence that could obtain nine consecutive victories was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
