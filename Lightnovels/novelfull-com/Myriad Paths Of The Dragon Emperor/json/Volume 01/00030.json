Lu Ming is my friend.”</p><p>...</p><p>“Friend? Haha, we have a lot of friends, and not everyone can fit into our team. I’d just like to know what level is his cultivation on?” Yuan Chong said coldly.</p><p>“Sixth Grade Warrior Realm,” Lu Ming replied with a sardonic smile.</p><p>“Hahaha, Sixth Grade Warrior Realm? Junior Feng Wu, you’d include a Sixth Grade Warrior Realm trash into our group? Even our weakest is a Ninth Grade Warrior Realm. That piece of grade six trash will definitely hold us back.”</p><p>Yuan Chong laughed scornfully as he mocked Lu Ming.</p><p>Disdain flashed across the other two young men’s eyes, but they remained silent.</p><p>“Miss Feng, it looks like I’m not welcomed here. I’ll make a move then.” Lu Ming cupped his fists towards Feng Wu and walked away.</p><p>“Wait up, Lu Ming!” Feng Wu cried as she grasped his hand hurriedly. She glowered at Yuan Chong, her eyes filled with fury as she growled, “Yuan Chong, that’s too much. I warn you, if you ever say something like that again, we’ll go our separate ways!”</p><p>“Feng Wu, you..”</p><p>Yuan Chong’s face dripped with malice. He did not expect Feng Wu to speak to him like this because of Lu Ming.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with resentment in his eyes, but he did not say anything else.</p><p>Right after, Feng Wu looked at Lu Ming pleadingly and whispered, “Lu Ming, I promised Big Sis Mu Lan to bring you along. If you leave, how am I gonna face Big Sis Mu Lan?”</p><p>Speechless, Lu Ming looked at Miss Pretty Girl Feng Wu who wanted him to stay because she was afraid of Mu Lan.</p><p>“Let’s follow them for the time being, gather some news and we’ll look for opportunities to leave.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it, and nodded, “okay then, we’ll team up.”</p><p>“That’s great!” Happiness was evident on Feng Wu’s face.</p><p>Yuan Chong’s face darkened further as he saw Feng Wu and Lu Ming whispering amongst themselves.</p><p>There were already people who went into the Midnight Hills.</p><p>Some formed groups of threes, while some were in groups of fives. There were also some solo rangers who disappeared into the Midnight Hills.</p><p>“Let’s go too, then.” Feng Wu announced.</p><p>She was clearly the pack leader. The five of them hurried into the Midnight Hills.</p><p>The Midnight Hills had a perimeter range of thousands of kilometers. It was a forest filled with sky-high trees and demonic beasts as beastly roars could be heard regularly.</p><p>“The outer 15 kilometers of the Midnight Hills are filled with ordinary beasts instead of demonic beasts. If we want points, we’ve gotta go in beyond the 15-kilometer range,” Feng Wu said to them.</p><p>Everyone nodded and made their way fleetingly into the deeper parts of the Midnight Hills.</p><p>Yuan Chong sprinted at full speed with a taunting smile on his face as he thought, ‘Let’s see how you catch up with me, you trash!’</p><p>His smirk was wiped off his expression right away as soon as he saw Lu Ming cover a 0.6-meter distance in a single step. Lu Ming ran beside Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu without breaking a sweat.</p><p>‘This trash has pretty good techniques.’ Yuan Chong thought to himself foully.</p><p>In their pack, Yuan Chong and Feng Wu both were in First Grade Master Realm while Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu were in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>Yuan Chong could have gone faster, but Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu would have been left behind.</p><p>What he did not know was that Lu Ming was only at 50% of his speed.</p><p>At the Fifth Stage of comprehension and practice, Perfect Divine-like Usage of Dragon Serpent Steps meant that each step Lu Ming took could cover a distance of 1.5 meters.</p><p>1</p><p>After an hour, the five of them were 15 kilometers deep into the Midnight Hills and they slowed down to watch out for the appearance of demonic beasts.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A ferocious black panther leaped towards Zhou Hao from within the bushes with its claws gleamingly sharp like knives, ready to kill.</p><p>“Wrong target!” Zhou Hao bellowed as he threw a punch that collided with the black panther’s claws.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black panther flew backward and slammed heavily on the ground. It rolled for several rounds before it ran away as fast as it could.</p><p>“Metal Black Panther, a mere Sixth Grade First Level demonic beast. Let it go, Zhou Hao. It has no metal pieces on it,” Feng Wu cried.</p><p>Zhou Hao wanted to go for it but stopped after he heard what Feng Wu said.</p><p>“Our mission is to earn points, so we’ll avoid those without metal pieces to save time and energy,” Feng Wu continued.</p><p>The rest nodded and continued on their journey, only to stop after a short while.</p><p>Feng Wu frowned as her gaze swept the area and commented, “Someone’s following us.”</p><p>“I’ve realized that too,” said Yuan Chong.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned because he felt a looming intent to kill him from the beginning.</p><p>“Who is it? Come out now!” Feng Wu ordered.</p><p>“Haha, Junior Sister Feng, you have such sharp senses!”</p><p>A humorless laugh rang from the left as two young men appeared.</p><p>“Wei Ziming!”</p><p>Recognition flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he recognized Wei Ziming, the person he had slapped at the restaurant in the Mystical Sword City.</p><p>Wei Ziming stared venomously at Lu Ming, and beside him was someone that looked like Wei Ziming but younger.</p><p>“Was it you, Wei Ziyou? Why were you following us?” Feng Wu snapped.</p><p>He was Wei Ziyou, Wei Ziming’s younger brother. It was common for the more famous geniuses to know each other.</p><p>“Junior Sister Feng, Senior Brother Yuan Chong, this is none of your business. I’m only here for him, Lu Ming!” Wei Ziyou smiled and pointed.</p><p>Feng Wu’s face darkened. “What do you want with Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Nothing much. He just slapped my brother twice a few days ago, so I’m just here to destroy both his hands. You’d better not get yourself involved, Junior Feng,” Wei Ziyou replied.</p><p>1</p><p>“But I will get myself involved because Lu Ming’s my teammate now,” Feng Wu insisted.</p><p>“Feng Wu, I’d say, you’d better mind your own business!” At that moment, a voice rang from the right side, and another two young men appeared.</p><p>They did not hide their cultivation level as they both released the energy from the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm. Even if it was just the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm, it caused a drastic change in Feng Wu’s expression.</p><p>“You’re from the Duanmu Clan. What are you guys doing here?” she shrieked. It was easy to recognize people from the Duanmu clan since all of them had a tree symbol sewn on their sleeves.</p><p>“We’re here for Lu Ming, of course! His life is ours now,” one of the Duanmus replied with a faint smile.</p><p>“Are you going to kill Lu Ming?” Feng Wu’s complexion paled.</p><p>How many people had Lu Ming offended? It was no wonder that Mu Lan wanted her to protect Lu Ming.</p><p>At the side, Yuan Chong smiled gleefully. Lu Ming really had a death wish when he offended the Duanmu Clan.</p><p>‘Duanmu Clan, Wei Ziyou, you both came like the rushing wind indeed.’ Lu Ming surveyed his surroundings, looking for a place to break out. He refused to sit around and wait for them to kill him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
