It’s only been about ten days. How did Lu Ming become so strong?! How?!</p><p>‘No, I refuse to accept it! I can’t die. I must run away and report this to the Duanmu Family and their experts, so they can kill Lu Ming once and for all! Then, I’ll get my hands on Feng Wu. I still have hope!’</p><p>Various thoughts spewed out within Yuan Chong’s mind.</p><p>“You’ve run out of chances,” Lu Ming stated as the light from his sword pierced through Yuan Chong’s heart.</p><p>That was all it took to put an end to Yuan Chong’s thoughts for good.</p><p>“Curse you, Lu Ming!” Yuan Chong roared with regret. Lu Ming was so firm that he did not give him any chance at all.</p><p>Almost immediately, Yuan Chong’s life flowed out of him and Lu Ming soundlessly devoured his essence.</p><p>From the side, Feng Wu gawked at Lu Ming. She was blown away. When Lu Ming disappeared about ten days ago, she thought that something bad had happened to him. She looked for him for a few days but to no avail.</p><p>Lu Ming shockingly appeared out of thin air just moments before and displayed such an overpowering advantage over Yuan Chong and killed him in the process. This was all too bewildering for her.</p><p>Had Lu Ming been suppressing his abilities before this?</p><p>It was possible.</p><p>“Are you okay, Senior Sister Feng Wu?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Feng Wu, grabbed her, and ran as fast as he could. The wind roared in their ears as the night breeze slapped their faces continuously.</p><p>Feng Wu peeled her eyes open and found Lu Ming speeding through the woods with her in his arms.</p><p>He glanced at her and smiled. It was a genuine, pure, platonic smile with no ulterior motives.</p><p>“The smell of blood would’ve attracted beasts. We need to move!”</p><p>Lu Ming dashed through the woods.</p><p>In no time, they found a quiet cave five kilometers away. Lu Ming placed Feng Wu down and draped his coat over her. Then, he sat in Lotus Position, closed his eyes, and meditated.</p><p>Feng Wu glanced at him deeply and proceeded to forcefully expel the drug from her system.</p><p>At the break of dawn, she managed to expel all the drugs from her system and recovered from the paralysis.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“Why’d you disappear, Lu Ming?” she asked without warning.</p><p>“Yuan Chong.” There and then, Lu Ming told Feng Wu everything that happened the past ten days since Yuan Chong blocked his way. However, he kept mum about his blood meridians, of course.</p><p>“That Yuan Chong is really a monster! How could he also gang up with the Duanmu Family?” Feng Wu gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Alright, now that you have all the poison expelled, I’ll be on my way,” he said.</p><p>“Why don’t we work together, Lu Ming? Experts from different halls have started to band up. From what I know, there’s a super genius in the Duanmu Family by the name of Duanmu Jue. He’s the strongest newbie in the White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“He’s teamed up with many experts from Duanmu Family and the White Tiger Hall to scavenge for point-worthy metal pieces everywhere because he’s aiming to get first place. If you bump into them alone, it’s gonna be really dangerous, so I think it’s best that we both team-up. At least, we can watch each other’s backs,” she explained as she held him back.</p><p>“The Duanmu Family? Do you know where they are?” Lu Ming’s eyes shone as he asked.</p><p>“I do know where they are, but what are you planning?”</p><p>“To grab their point-worthy metal pieces, of course!”</p><p>A cold smile was etched on Lu Ming’s face as he added in his heart, ‘I’ll take it as a small part of their interest repayment.’</p><p>“You want to rob the Duanmu Family? It’s too dangerous!” Feng Wu paled.</p><p>“I’m not gonna face them head-on, so what’s there to fear?” he answered.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll go together then.” She swung her fists in the air, her ponytail swish-swashing as a glint of excitement grew in her eyes. Feng Wu was a mischievous one too.</p><p>“Haha, let’s team up then!” Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>“Wait!” Feng Wu yelped and scurried towards the bushes. In a short moment, when she walked out, she had changed into a different set of clothes.</p><p>‘Storage rings!’</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly moved.</p><p>Storage rings were rings made by powerful inscribers that gave its bearer space to store things. It was extremely expensive and scarce. Even families as huge as the Lu Family could not afford one.</p><p>There was more than what met the eyes when it came to Feng Wu.</p><p>“Thanks for your coat!” She tossed the coat back to Lu Ming and led the way as the pair made their way toward the deeper parts of the Midnight Hills.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
