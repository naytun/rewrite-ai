Looks like your foresight isn’t any good. Lu Ming may have some potential, but he will die prematurely due to his arrogance,” Ning Kong mocked.</p><p>Mu Lan pursed her lips and said icily, “Your son’s the one that will die a premature death.”</p><p>...</p><p>“Hmph, really? I hope you’ll still be able to say the same later.” Ning Kong waved his hand exasperatedly and sat down.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Ning Feng leaped down from the viewing platform, his figure as swift as a swallow.</p><p>In a few strides, he had covered at least 50 meters, appearing on the Vermillion Bird Stage in no time.</p><p>“What a handsome technique! All the years Ning Feng has spent practicing martial arts truly cannot be overlooked. He’s reached the Fifth Stage with this Inferior Yellow Level technique-the Swallow’s Three Dips.”</p><p>“It’s only normal for Ning Feng to reach such a level since his father’s guided him every step of the way all these years, but Lu Ming’s just a newly enrolled apprentice. At the very least, his martial arts technique is definitely no match for Ning Feng.”</p><p>“You’re right!”</p><p>Apprentices around discussed fervently.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s here!” one of the apprentices yelled.</p><p>From a mountain path, Lu Ming walked out with Pang Shi and Hua Chi by his side.</p><p>“I never thought Lu Ming would still dare to show up!”</p><p>“Hmph, he’s here to die. I reckon he won’t even survive ten hits from Senior Brother Ning.”</p><p>“Ten hits? I’d say even three hits are a miracle.”</p><p>Apprentices who sat by Ning Kong mocked as the crowd naturally parted ways for Lu Ming’s entourage.</p><p>Lu Ming then walked up calmly onto the Vermillion Bird Stage until he stood face to face with Ning Feng.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re actually here. I thought you’d hide away in your dorm like a scaredy-cat!” Ning Feng taunted.</p><p>“Did you think you’re that powerful, Ning Feng?” Lu Ming smiled nonchalantly.</p><p>“You’ll soon find out. It’s a fight to the death up here on the Vermillion Bird Stage, Lu Ming. Hehe, it’s too late for you to have regrets now.” Ning Feng smirked.</p><p>“Cut the bullsh*t and get on with it. I just hope that you don’t disappoint me,” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, disappoint you?” Ning Feng roared in laughter as if he had just heard an extremely funny joke.</p><p>He had been enrolled as a Vermillion Bird Hall apprentice for five years now. Although his talents were not exceptionally mindblowing, he was not a weakling.</p><p>Now, a month-old newbie was telling him straight to his face not to be a disappointment.</p><p>What a joke, an absolute joke.</p><p>Right then, Ning Feng’s face darkened as he said, “Since you can’t wait to die, I’ll grant your death wish. Today, I’ll be the one to trample on your confidence and destroy your dignity.”</p><p>He chuckled humorlessly as he moved quickly, striking his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>A black light shrouded his palms as Ning Feng’s Essential Qi burst forth, cutting through the air with a shrill sound.</p><p>It was the Black Lava Palm, Inferior Yellow Level martial arts technique.</p><p>“That’s all? Was that meant to crush me?” Lu Ming threw a punch with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>The Flame Dragon Fist!</p><p>Scalding hot gas filled the air as Lu Ming’s fist flew out, and a faint dragon’s cry slowly followed after.</p><p>The punch was mighty and its force was unstoppable as it collide heavily with Ning Feng’s palm.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>A resounding boom was heard as Lu Ming’s fist and Ning Feng’s palm slammed against each other. Gusts of hot air spewed outwards, spreading everywhere.</p><p>Both Lu Ming and Ning Feng parted as soon as they collided. One figure staggered backward with three consecutive thumps.</p><p>It was Ning Feng.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Was Ning Feng defeated with just one move? How was that possible?</p><p>From the aura Ning Feng exerted, it was clear that he had a top Sixth Grade Master Realm cultivation.</p><p>It was unbelievable for a top Sixth Grade Master to be defeated by Lu Ming with just one punch! How was Lu Ming so strong?</p><p>Ning Feng was stunned. He did not expect Lu Ming to really be this strong.</p><p>In the crowd, Pang Shi cheered enthusiastically, “Wow, nice one! All hail Senior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>At the viewing platform, Mu Lan’s eyes flashed. A smile appeared on her face as she turned to Ning Kong and said, “It looks like Lu Ming’s better.”</p><p>“Hmph, it’s too early to tell!” Ming Kong scoffed.</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Ning Feng roared in his heart, ‘This Lu Ming’s crazy talented! Destroy him! I must kill him today, or else, there’ll no longer be a place for me in the Vermillion Bird Hall!’</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His sword was unsheathed.</p><p>“Demonic Wind Sword Technique-Tumbling Clouds in the Wind!”</p><p>At that same moment, Ning Feng unleashed his powers and Sword Qi exploded. He swung his sword and attacked Lu Ming with all his might, intending to kill.</p><p>Lu Ming smirked coldly and unsheathed his own sword. His Sword Qi beamed like shooting stars, slicing the air with ear-piercing whistles.</p><p>This was not the Onyx Blade Sword, but the Celestial Star Sword, the sword his father had left behind. The Onyx Blade Sword was only a Superior First Level spiritual weapon and was not strong enough for the duel with Ning Feng.</p><p>On the other hand, the sword that Lu Ming’s father left him was a Superior Second Level spiritual weapon. That was sufficient enough to exhibit his strength at full power.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Both swords collided with a roaring clang. Both Lu Ming and Ning Feng shuddered. They continued fighting.</p><p>Clang! Clang!…</p><p>As the swords collided, Sword Qi spewed everywhere. The two fighting figures were visually drowned by the constant beams of sword light.</p><p>“Strong, so strong! Lu Ming can actually duel with Ning Feng.”</p><p>“Even with the Demonic Wind Sword Technique, Ning Feng’s Fifth Stage Superior Yellow Level sword technique, Lu Ming seems to be of equal fighting strength with his sword technique! Unbelievable.”</p><p>“This duel’s definitely worth watching.”</p><p>Senior apprentices could barely remain calm as they witnessed what was happening on stage.</p><p>“Demonic Wind Sword Technique-World Execution Through Wind!”</p><p>“Demonic Wind Sword Technique-Mad Hurricane Wipe Out!”</p><p>…….</p><p>Ning Feng fought constantly with powerful moves from the Demonic Wind Sword Technique.</p><p>In a flash, 50 moves were exchanged between both of them.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming and Ning Feng separated abruptly after a loud clang.</p><p>“I’ll admit that you have pretty good skills to be able to duel with me like this, Lu Ming. But today, you shall die. Now, let me show you what I’m capable of.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>There was a sudden blast that came from within Ning Feng, and his aura increased at an alarming speed as a mountain-like aura erupted from him.</p><p>“Seventh Grade Master Realm! Ning Feng’s a Seventh Grade Master.”</p><p>“Lu Ming is done for. A Seventh Grade Master Realm is incomparable with a Sixth Grade Master. Lu Ming’s gonna die now that Ning Feng’s broken through.”</p><p>“What a waste of a super genius.”</p><p>“So what if he’s a genius? There are plenty of geniuses under the sun, and only God knows how many geniuses have died every year. Geniuses who don’t live long are worth nothing.”</p><p>As soon as Ning Feng displayed his Seventh Grade Master Realm cultivation, almost everyone thought that Lu Ming was done for.</p><p>On the viewing platform, Mu Lan, Feng Wu, and the rest looked shocked and worried.</p><p>“Haha!” Ning Kong roared with laughter and said, “You didn’t expect it, didn’t you, Mu Lan?! This time, Lu Ming MUST die!”</p><p>There was a glint in Mu Lan’s eyes, but she did not respond. Deep down, she was unsure too.</p><p>Could Lu Ming withstand Ning Feng’s blows?</p><p>“I’ll show you my full strength now, Lu Ming! The only price you have to pay for witnessing this is death!” Ning Feng boasted proudly as a blood-red light flashed above him.</p><p>Blood meridian explosion!</p><p>He had a Fourth Level blood meridian, so he had a 40% increase in power after his blood meridian explosion.</p><p>“Demonic Wind Sword Technique-Tumbling Clouds in the Wind!”</p><p>Ning Feng’s sword hacked towards Lu Ming accompanied by a howling gale that turned into beams of sword light. Although it was the same move, it was much stronger when compared to the one before that.</p><p>“That’s more like it!”</p><p>On the Vermillion Bird Stage, Lu Ming squinted and stomped heavily on stage. His body shot out like lightning.</p><p>At the same time, his aura drastically increased as he shot out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
