Duanmu Jue is dead!” one of the Duanmu youths reported fearfully.</p><p>“W-what?!” Duanmu Jin froze. His eyes widened as he let out a small cry. How could he have remained calm?</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone who heard the news was startled.</p><p>The other three guidance elders had a slight change in expression. A look of joy flitted across Xie Kuang’s face.</p><p>Duanmu Jue was actually dead? How did he die?</p><p>Yin Kai, Huang Yu, and some others could not help but look pointedly at Lu Ming.</p><p>Where did Lu Ming’s points come from? Judging by the amount, it was impossible for him to have killed all those demonic beasts alone. Could it be from Duanmu Jue?</p><p>“Speak. How did Duanmu Jue die?” Duanmu Jin ordered maliciously.</p><p>“A slit across the throat with a sword,” said a young man.</p><p>“A slit across the throat with a sword?! Who did it?” Cold killing intent erupted from Duanmu Jin.</p><p>“We don’t know. When we found Duanmu Jin’s trail and followed it, he was already dead. We also found two other bodies with him. They were the White Tiger Hall’s Third Grade Master Realm apprentices.”</p><p>“What?! Don’t you know who did it?” Killing intent flickered in Duanmu Jin’s eyes. He abruptly turned to face Lu Ming as he barked, “Speak, Lu Ming! Did you kill Duanmu Jue?”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could answer, Xie Kuang retorted with a roar, “Duanmu Jin! What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>“Elder Duanmu, did you even see me kill Duanmu Jue? Also, you heard him. There were two other Third Grade Master Realm experts with him. Did you really think I could kill him?” Lu Ming answered with a faint smile.</p><p>Many pondered upon Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>‘That’s true. Does Lu Ming even have the skills to kill Duanmu Jue and the two other Third Grade Master Realm experts?’</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Duanmu Jin scoffed, “How do you explain the amount of point-worthy metal pieces in your possession? You must’ve killed Duanmu Jue with some kind of despicable trick. I’ll destroy you right now, you shameless, filthy prick!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As he took a stride, a formidable aura erupted from Duanmu Jin, pressing against Lu Ming like a lofty mountain.</p><p>The crushing weight was too strong for Lu Ming to handle. He felt like a mountain had slammed into him and his body shook as he was forced backward. Blood threatened to spew out from his mouth.</p><p>“What are you doing, Duanmu Jin!?” Xie Kuang raged as he hid Lu Ming behind him. An equally formidable aura exploded from him, shielding Lu Ming from Duanmu Jin’s aura.</p><p>“Piss off, Xie Kuang!” Duanmu Jin bellowed.</p><p>“Fatty Duanmu, do you have fats for a f*cking brain? In the Mystical Sword Sect, winners have always taken it all. Which rule calls for an explanation of the source of the point-worthy metal pieces? Did you live all these f*cking years as a dog?” Fury rose from within Lu Ming as he berated. He refused to be bullied.</p><p>“Wha-”</p><p>It was once again a jaw-dropping moment for everyone present.</p><p>How reckless of Lu Ming to dare yell at Duanmu Jin in public like that!</p><p>Sure enough, Duanmu Jin was so mad that he shook uncontrollably. He raised his arm and pointed at Lu Ming. “You little b*stard, w-what did you just say?”</p><p>“Great, you’re deaf too. Guess you really did live a f*cking dog life.” Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“I’ll kill you, you little b*stard!” Duanmu Jin’s eyes glowed a frenzy red as he threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stay where you are!” Xie Kuang’s fist collided with Duanmu Jin’s.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Both Xie Kuang and Duanmu Jin staggered backward from the blast.</p><p>“Piss off, Xie Kuang, or I’ll kill you as well!” Duanmu Jin yelled.</p><p>“I was afraid that you can’t.” Xie Kuang refused to budge.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just then, immense pressure came from the skies. The pressure was so great that it felt as if it had unfathomable depths like the ocean, paralyzing both Xie Kuang and Duanmu Jin.</p><p>“Silver-robed Elder!” Both of them gasped.</p><p>In the skies, a displeased elderly man hovered over them and rebuked, “Absurd, both of you! Shamelessly fighting to the death in front of all the apprentices as guidance elders. For what? To be ridiculed by the younger generation?”</p><p>“Elder Wang, Lu Ming used despicable methods to kill Duanmu Jue and the rest. He cannot go unpunished! I suggest stripping him of his Apprentice Champion title,” Duanmu Jin cupped his fists towards the Silver-robed Elder as he spoke.</p><p>“Hehe, I’m gonna say the same to you, Duanmu Jin. Did you see me kill Duanmu Jue and the rest in despicable ways? And you tell me that you haven’t f*cking lived as a dog.”</p><p>Since Lu Ming was already an arch-nemesis with the Duanmu Family, he said whatever he wanted and insulted Duanmu Jin without any restraint. He was sure that Xie Kuang and the Silver-robed Elder would not let anything happen to him.</p><p>“How dare you, insolent fool!? You have no respect for the elders!” Duanmu Jin howled, his prosperous body trembling with unconstrained fury.</p><p>He was outraged! All he wanted was to pound Lu Ming into a meatloaf.</p><p>“You and your yelling, Duanmu Jin! Just spit it out. You’re weaseling out! All it took was 30 spiritual crystals for you to accuse and trample over a new genius apprentice. That’s certainly a first for me!” Xie Kuang took the chance to mock him.</p><p>“You..” Furious and flustered, Duanmu Jin nearly vomited blood as his chest rose up and down rapidly.</p><p>Everyone else stared with their mouths wide open nearby.</p><p>Geniuses like Huang Yu and Xie Hong saw Lu Ming in a different light.</p><p>While they had remarkable backgrounds, even they had no courage to yell at a Duanmu elder in public like that.</p><p>Lu Ming was flaunting such lawlessness!</p><p>Duanmu Jin took a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm down as he cupped his fist towards the Silver-robed Elder once more and said, “Elder Wang, I’m sure Lu Ming used despicable methods to gather such an amount of point-worthy metal pieces. If he’s allowed to win the first prize like that, I’m afraid it’ll be hard to convince the other new apprentices. I suggest that we test his abilities. If he passes, I’ll acknowledge him as the Apprentice Champion.”</p><p>“No way, Elder Wang! The new apprentice test has always used points to determine placings, and there have never been any restrictions on how the points are obtained,” Xie Kuang objected hurriedly.</p><p>Duanmu Jin scoffed, “Don’t you forget, Xie Kuang. All the previous Apprentice Champions were publicly recognized for their abilities. Even those who were fortunate were proven to be capable. But this Lu Ming…where’s he from? What’s he capable of?”</p><p>His words were laced thick with disdain.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“How would you like to test him, Duanmu Jin?” The Silver-robed Elder pondered.</p><p>“Very simple. Come on out, Duanmu Tao,” Duanmu Jin ordered with a wave.</p><p>Immediately, a young man stepped out from where the old apprentices were.</p><p>Duanmu Jin pointed at that young man and said, “This time, the strongest cultivation level among the new apprentices is the Fourth Grade Master Realm, which is exactly Duanmu Tao’s cultivation level. If Lu Ming beats Duanmu Tao, I’ll acknowledge his Apprentice Champion title. If not, I suggest that Lu Ming be stripped of his first placing.”</p><p>Xie Kuang’s expression changed. “I object. Duanmu Tao is a third-year apprentice. Even if his cultivation’s on the Fourth Grade Master Realm, it’s not fair for a new apprentice to fight someone who’s trained for three years.”</p><p>“If you don’t have what it takes, just say it out loud. The Apprentice Champion title isn’t as attainable as you think it is,” Duanmu Jin replied coldly.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll do it,” Lu Ming agreed all of a sudden.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
