They were just too young and immature. They just hadn’t matured yet.</p><p>Perhaps in a few years, some people would also grow to be very powerful.</p><p>“Capture him!”</p><p>He tie waved his hand and said.</p><p>Lu Ming was already seriously injured. He did not need to do anything.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to resist now.”</p><p>The remaining dozen or so enforcement Hall disciples walked toward Lu Ming with ferocious looks on their faces.</p><p>Lu Ming had injured more than twenty of them. They were both fearful and hateful of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming supported himself with his long sword. He scanned his surroundings and sneered.</p><p>“What are you laughing at? you’ll get it when we get to the law enforcement Palace.”</p><p>A skinny monkey-like young man laughed hideously and clawed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>He wanted to press Lu Ming’s head to the ground and humiliate him.</p><p>But-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A sword light flashed, and a few streams of blood shot out. There were five fingers in the blood.</p><p>Skinny monkey looked at his bare palm in a daze, then let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>ah, my finger! Lu Ming, I want you to die!</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was the one who slashed her just now.</p><p>“Go, let’s attack together.”</p><p>The others roared.</p><p>There were ten of them, including a ninth grade master realm expert.</p><p>One attack after another was directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his essential Qi with great effort and waved his sword to block the attack.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a few consecutive moves, Lu Ming’s body kept retreating. With a swish, he was struck by a sword and blood immediately flowed out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, lie down and surrender!”</p><p>A young man from the Tribunal Council shouted.</p><p>“In your dreams!”</p><p>The only response they got was two simple words.</p><p>“Then I’ll beat you until you lie down.”</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The attacks continued to surge toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These Tribunal Council disciples were all experts.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming was severely injured and it was difficult for him to withstand the attacks. After a few moves, a few more wounds appeared on his body and blood flowed out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was stained red with blood. His steps were light and he seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>However, he still stood tall and straight. His eyes were still firm and persistent.</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was silent, and the air seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>No one spoke as they stared at the figure in a daze.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>The new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples clenched their fists and their eyes turned red.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with guilt.</p><p>They felt guilty for not standing up for them earlier.</p><p>They all knew that the reason why Lu Ming came here and tore down the star Moon Tower was to avenge pang Shi.</p><p>For his friends, for his brothers, to be able to do this, this was a true man, a true man.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, they felt that they were too inferior.</p><p>“Stop, stop!”</p><p>The skinny youth roared and suddenly charged forward.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The red-robed young man suddenly rushed out and slapped the thin young man, sending him flying. He said arrogantly, ” “Get lost, you’ll get it later.”</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and laughed.”Lu Ming, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Why? Now I can’t, I don’t have any strength. Come and hit me, haha!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as the red-robed young man finished speaking, he was slapped hard on the face.</p><p>This slap was extremely loud and extremely ruthless.</p><p>The red-robed young man’s body spun a few times before coming to a stop. One side of his face was almost smashed, and blood was spurting out of his teeth.</p><p>He was so stunned that he even forgot to scream.</p><p>He looked at the person who hit him in a daze.</p><p>It was a woman, an extremely alluring and sexy woman with an extremely good figure.</p><p>However, her expression was extremely cold.</p><p>“Mu … Mu Lan!”</p><p>A name flashed through the red-robed youth’s mind.</p><p>Mu Lan had finally arrived. No one could see how she had arrived.</p><p>“Since you’re asking for a beating, I’ll definitely fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Mu Lan’s cold voice was heard. She then waved her hand.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Another slap landed on the other side of the red-robed young man’s face.</p><p>Blood was still spurting out because all the teeth had been spat out.</p><p>The red-robed young man did not fly out. He was pulled by a force and spun a dozen times on the spot before he stopped. It was clear how powerful the slap was.</p><p>The moment he stopped, he saw Mu Lan’s cold face again.</p><p>His heart trembled and he almost peed his pants. He shouted, ” “Fu (not) Xiao (want) ah.”</p><p>His mouth was leaking air, and he couldn’t even speak clearly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mu Lan kicked the red-robed young man and sent him flying more than ten meters. He screamed and fainted.</p><p>Not far away, Yao Tianyu, who had been very calm all this while, was no longer calm. He looked at Mu Lan with a grave expression.</p><p>The people from the law enforcement Hall did not dare to make a move either. They looked at Mu Lan with a grave expression.</p><p>Mu Lan did not even look at the others. She walked to Lu Ming’s side and said with a concerned expression, ” “Are you alright?”</p><p>“It’s fine, I won’t die yet. I owe you another favor this time.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You can still smile? quickly take this pill.”</p><p>Mu Lan took out a pill and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony. He took it and swallowed it in one mouthful.</p><p>The pill melted in his mouth and turned into waves of energy that permeated Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>His wound quickly stopped bleeding.</p><p>Such a strong medicinal effect. This healing medicinal pill’s grade was definitely not low.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Lan turned to Yao Tianyu and said coldly, ” “You’re good, you dare to attack the Vermillion Bird Hall’s disciples!”</p><p>“Elder Mu Lan!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s expression turned ugly. He cupped his fists and said, ” “Elder Mu Lan, we’re enforcing the law impartially. Lu Ming relied on his high cultivation base to injure dozens of people from the star Moon Tower for no reason. He even forcefully demolished the star Moon Tower. Of course, the law enforcement Hall has to severely punish such an unruly and reckless disciple.”</p><p>“But Lu Ming is insane. Not only did he resist arrest, but he also injured so many people from the law enforcement Hall. Elder Mu Lan, as the chief elder of the Vermillion Bird hall, I hope you won’t shield him.”</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>The skinny youth’s face was swollen after being slapped by the red-robed youth. He walked out resolutely and said, ” “It’s obvious that the star Moon Tower forcefully bought the materials for the Vermillion Bird Hall’s new apprentices. They even beat people up. Senior brother Lu Ming is fighting for us and seeking justice. How is this against the sect rules?”</p><p>“That’s right, senior brother Lu Ming is seeking justice for us!”</p><p>A few more new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples walked out.</p><p>With Mu Lan’s arrival, they were emboldened and couldn’t hold it in any longer, so they told the truth.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>“How could the star Moon Tower do such a thing?” Yao Tianyu asked in a low voice. If they did, the Tribunal Council would have punished them long ago. Moreover, you said that you only bought the Vermillion Bird Hall by force. That’s even more ridiculous. Does the star Moon Tower have any enmity with the Vermillion Bird Hall?”</p><p>I think it’s obvious that the few of you are in cahoots with Lu Ming. You want to frame the star Moon Tower.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
