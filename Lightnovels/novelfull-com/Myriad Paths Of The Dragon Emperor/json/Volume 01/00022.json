The next day, Lu Ming, Li Ping, and Qiu Yue moved back into the Lord’s Residence once again.</p><p>As he was standing in front of the residence gates, his mind was filled with thoughts.</p><p>...</p><p>All of this was thanks to the change brought by the advancement of his power.</p><p>If he was still the piece of trash whose blood meridians had been stripped from him, he would be unable to save his own life, let alone move back into the Lord’s Residence. Besides that, Li Ping and Qiu Yue would also be unable to live a smooth life.</p><p>However, everything changed because of his sudden rise. Not only did he completely disrupt Lu Yunxiong and Lu Yao’s plans, but he also snatched back the Lord’s Residence. Li Ping was also guaranteed a comfortable life from now on.</p><p>1</p><p>As the descendant of the Lu Family’s main bloodline, Lu Ming could succeed as the Lord whenever he wanted as long as he felt like it.</p><p>However, it was far from enough as all this was merely the beginning. Lu Ming knew that there were greater challenges awaiting him in the Mystical Sword Sect. He could not slow down for a single moment.</p><p>“Ming’er, let’s go in. The room has been tidied up.” Li Ping smiled as she walked out with a sword in hand.</p><p>The Elder Council sent four young maids over specifically to serve Li Ping and Lu Ming, so the Lord’s Residence was quickly cleared of Lu Yao and the other’s possessions.</p><p>“Ming’er, now that you have a foothold in martial arts, you should use the spiritual weapon that your father sent back!” Li Ping handed the sword in her hands over to Lu Ming.</p><p>This sword, which had been taken by Lu Chuan, was once again back in their hands.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and took the sword as he walked into the residence together with Li Ping.</p><p>After he returned to his room, he started cultivating.</p><p>Having consumed the Spirit Soul Pill a few days ago, his cultivation spiked from top of First Grade Warrior Realm to beginner of Third Grade Warrior Realm. After ascending two grades in one go, it was inevitable that his foundation would be unsteady, thus he needed to consolidate it.</p><p>After cultivating the True War Dragon Technique for a few hours, Lu Ming entered the Supreme Shrine and started to cultivate his martial arts skills.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On the eighth day, Lu Ming was cultivating in the Supreme Shrine when he sensed a commotion outside, so he proceeded to exit the Supreme Shrine.</p><p>He heard Qiu Yue’s voice coming from outside his room the moment he went out. “Young Master, Lu Bing is here to pay his respects.”</p><p>“Lu Bing?” Startled, Lu Ming opened his door and walked out.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded. “Young Master, do you wish to see him?”</p><p>“Sure I do. Why not?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>When he reached the living room, he saw Lu Bing pacing anxiously.</p><p>Lu Bing smiled the second he saw Lu Ming. “Master Ming, you’ve finally come!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed the change in how Lu Bing addressed him. He smiled feebly as he sat on the main seat absentmindedly. “Why have you come to me?”</p><p>Lu Bing suddenly clasped his fist at Lu Ming. “Master Ming, I’ve come to apologize today. I was blind to your talent before and even offended you before. I hope that you’ll be gracious enough not to hold a grudge.”</p><p>“Lu Bing, the Fifth Branch Elder asked you to come, didn’t he?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You’re right. My father asked me to come, but it is aligned with my aim as well. Master Ming, there are 5,000 silver notes here which I hope you’ll graciously accept.” Lu Bing took out a stack of silver notes and handed it over to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright. Qiu Yue, help me accept it.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. To be frank, he had never once thought about Lu Bing, but since he came to apologize with money in hand, why should he not accept it?</p><p>Qiu Yue went up to take the silver notes, her small face flushed with excitement. She had never seen so many silver notes before!</p><p>Although it pained Lu Bing, he forced a smile. “Thank you, Master Ming, I shall take my leave now.”</p><p>Just after Lu Bing had left, another maid walked up to report, “Young Master, the Lord of the Li Family has come to pay his respects.”</p><p>“The Lord of the Li Family…Li Fu.” Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He had a terrible impression of Li Fu.</p><p>“Have you notified your Lady?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, I have,” the maid replied.</p><p>At that moment, Li Ping walked over and said, “Ming’er, since your uncle has arrived, let’s just meet him!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and ordered the maid to bring Li Fu in.</p><p>“Haha, lil’ sister, Ming’er, I’ve come to visit!” Li Fu guffawed the moment he came in. His face was plastered with such a wide smile that anyone unaware of the situation would assume that he had a close relationship with Lu Ming and his mother!</p><p>“Big brother,” Li Ping greeted him.</p><p>However, an icy smile hung on Lu Ming’s face as he sat absentmindedly. “Lord Li, why have you come to the Lu Residence today? It can’t be because you wanted to meet this piece of trash, right?”</p><p>“Cough! Cough!” Li Fu coughed as his elderly face turned red. He chuckled wryly and said, “Ming’er, you’re such a genius. How could you be a piece of trash? If anyone says that the next time, I’ll definitely break his leg.</p><p>“Ming’er, I believed in those rumors because I’m muddled due to my old age. I hope you won’t take it to heart.”</p><p>At that point, Lu Ming realized that yet another person had come to apologize.</p><p>Lu Ming’s outburst this time was definitely startling. Although he had offended the Duanmu Family, he had also gained the favor of Mu Lan from the Elixir Hall. It was hard to tell how successful he would be in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, it was set in stone that Lu Ming was next in line as the family Lord, so anyone who had offended him before, such as Lu Bing and Li Fu, would be in trouble. Therefore, they all stepped up to apologize and reconcile.</p><p>It was now evidently clear that the strong ruled over the weak in the martial arts world.</p><p>“Rest assured, big brother. I definitely won’t take it to heart,” Li Ping said as a joyful smile lit up her face.</p><p>“That would be great, lil’ sister! I’ve prepared ten Qi Condensation Pills as a token of gratitude. Please accept it!” Li Fu said as he produced a jade bottle.</p><p>The Qi Condensation Pills were Inferior Second Level pills. One pill was worth 2,000 silver taels, while ten would amount to 20,000 silver taels. It seemed that Li Fu had gone to the bank for this one.</p><p>It should be noted that 20,000 silver taels were equal to the Li Family’s income for half a year.</p><p>Even the Lu Family, the biggest family in the Fiery Wind City, had an annual income of approximately 200,000 silver taels.</p><p>“Thank you then!” Lu Ming quickly accepted it.</p><p>He had originally planned to ignore Li Fu, but Li Ping was from the Li Family after all. Lu Ming could tell that she still cared about the Li Family’s attitude a lot and was obviously pleased when Li Fu came to apologize.</p><p>That was why Lu Ming had to pretend for Li Ping’s sake. There was no harm in accepting the ten Qi Condensation Pills.</p><p>Li Fu finally relaxed after seeing Lu Ming accept the pills. Even though he was pained over the 20,000 silver taels, it was an investment. If Lu Ming really rose in power, the Li Family would not have a hard time.</p><p>If he had known that Lu Ming was so talented, he would have avoided offending him at all costs.</p><p>After some short banter, Li Fu bade his farewell and left.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, how many meridians have you opened?” Lu Ming quickly asked Qiu Yue after Li Fu left.</p><p>Li Ping stared at her with a curious expression as well.</p><p>“Young Master, Madam, I just opened the eighth meridian yesterday!” Qiu Yue answered cheerfully.</p><p>“What?” Lu Ming and Li Ping were shocked to their core as they stared at her incredulously.</p><p>The first few meridians were relatively easy, but it would get progressively harder.</p><p>Qiu Yue had already opened eight meridians after ten or so days. What was important was that she was cultivating with the Qi Condensation Art which was a basic art! She had not consumed a single pill at all. This kind of talent was shocking.</p><p>‘Can Qiu Yue open a divine meridian without the help of a blood meridian?’ Lu Ming could not help but wonder.</p><p>“Mother, Qiu Yue, don’t tell anyone about this for now,” Lu Ming told Li Ping and Qiu Yue who both nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
