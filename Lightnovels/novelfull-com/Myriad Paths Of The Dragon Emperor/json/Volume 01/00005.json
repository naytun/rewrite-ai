He held his breath and listened carefully.</p><p>“Haha, of course. I spent an exorbitant amount of effort to convince one of the mistresses of the Psammophis Pirate’s leader. Then, I found out about this side route through the sl*t. If I weren’t on such good terms with you, I wouldn’t even bring you here.”</p><p>...</p><p>Another voice rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that they were two young men.</p><p>“I knew it! Brother Feng is so handsome and suave, which lady in this world could possibly resist your charms?” A slew of bootlicking words came from the first voice.</p><p>“Haha!’ Brother Feng seemed to be satisfied. “There’s a cave here, let’s go in and take a break. We’ll wait for the Lord to go against the Psammophis Pirates later, and take the opportunity to sneak ourselves into their den. Their leader’s treasure will be ripe for us to reap!” he said.</p><p>With that said, two youths around the ages of seventeen and eighteen entered the cave.</p><p>They spotted Lu Ming the moment they walked into the cave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is that you? What are you doing here?”</p><p>One of the youths with a mole on his face exclaimed.</p><p>“People from the Li Family.” Lu Ming was stunned too.</p><p>He recognized these two youths from Li Ping’s old home. They were juniors from the Li Family.</p><p>One of them was Li Feng, who wore handsome features. The one with the black mole was called Li Fei.</p><p>“Lu Ming, our conversation just now, you heard it?” Li Feng’s face dimmed as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I guess you could say so!” said Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you heard it, then you can only blame yourself for being unlucky.”</p><p>Killing intent flashed across Li Feng’s eyes.</p><p>“You want to kill me?” Lu Ming’s face dimmed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, remember to be smarter in your next life. Trash like you shouldn’t be running around, or it’ll be easy to find yourself on death’s door.” Li Feng’s voice was as cool as ice, his disdain visibly present in his tone.</p><p>“Brother Feng, there’s no need for you to make a move. I’ll kill him.” Li Fei took a step forward, seemingly looking down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Although the two of them saw the tiger’s corpse in the cave, they did not think that it was Lu Ming that killed it, but rather other beasts, or even a demonic beast.</p><p>Did they not know what standard Lu Ming was at?</p><p>“Mm, make it quick. Deal with this trash, and we’ll take a quick break,” Li Feng nodded.</p><p>“Brother Feng, rest assured, it’ll be over in a flash,” Li Fei smiled savagely as his hand formed a claw that was aiming for Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Li Fei was in mid Novice Realm and had opened up five meridians. His claw had at least two hundred and fifty kilograms behind it. If it hits the mark, even if he did not die, Lu Ming would sustain heavy injuries.</p><p>“Since you want to kill me, I’ll have to kill you first.”</p><p>Lu Ming murmured, murderous intent flashing across his eyes. His body moved and a fist came flying out.</p><p>Flame Dragon Fist!</p><p>He waited for the opportunity to throw a punch, and it landed directly on Li Fei’s chest.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Li Fei flew up like a cloth sack. He hit the walls of the cave hard, spurting blood out of his mouth before he stopped breathing.</p><p>Li Fei was killed by Lu Ming in one hit.</p><p>“You… you killed Li Fei? How is that possible?”</p><p>From the sides, Li Feng was wide-eyed. “Aren’t you supposed to be trash? But you managed to kill Li Fei?” he yelled incredulously.</p><p>“Trash? Hehe, then please allow this trash to send you to your death.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Send me to my death? Hilarious. I’ve already opened up eight meridians, you think you can kill me? Do you think that I’m Li Fei? It’s time to die!”</p><p>Li Fei quickly calmed down. He unsheathed his sword and swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Li Feng was just a normal martial artist. His martial skills were inferior, and his level of attainment was even worse. How could he be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Using the Dragon Serpent Step, Li Feng’s sword was dodged with a single step. A fist flew out and landed on Li Feng’s stomach.</p><p>Li Feng cried out in pain as he was lifted off the ground. He fell onto the floor as blood spewed from his mouth.</p><p>However, Li Feng had a higher cultivation. Instead of dying, he merely sustained heavy injuries.</p><p>“You’re so bad, but you’re still calling me trash?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Li Feng, his terrifying killing intent emanating from him.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me!” Li Feng shouted, scared out of his wits.</p><p>He would have never expected that Lu Ming had grown so strong.</p><p>“How do I get to the side route to the Psammophis Pirates’ den? Spit it out.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to kill Li Feng in a single hit. The Psammophis Pirates’ den was the reason why he had not done so.</p><p>The Psammophis Pirates were a band of robbers that were active around the vicinity of the Mountain of Beasts. They robbed and killed, committing all sorts of heinous acts.</p><p>As a result of the complicated terrain in the mountain forest, they were never wiped out.</p><p>Over the years, the Psammophis Pirates had plundered countless swords and treasures. If Lu Ming could get his hands on them, then he would have the money to acquire Dragon Tiger Pills.</p><p>“I can tell you where the side route to the Psammophis Pirates’ den is, but you’ll have to let me off.”</p><p>Li Feng said with a glint in his eyes.</p><p>At the same time, he was furiously yelling in his mind. Once this was over, he would be sure to exact revenge on Lu Ming. Not only him, but his mother as well, she would have to suffer too.</p><p>“You’re in no position to ask for conditions now. I’ll immediately kill you if you don’t tell me.” Lu Ming’s eyes were like ice, filled with murderous intent as he glared at Li Feng.</p><p>Li Feng’s heart turned cold. “Alright! I’ll speak, I’ll speak…”</p><p>At that moment, Li Feng revealed the side route to the Psammophis Pirates’ den.</p><p>“I can go now, right?” Li Feng asked as he finished speaking.</p><p>“Go? Let you go so that you can seek revenge on me?” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>After saying that, he struck Li Feng’s chest with his fist, killing him.</p><p>Over the highs and lows of these recent years, Lu Ming had learned to understand the world.</p><p>In the world of martial arts, the strong preyed on the weak. Sometimes, even if you spared someone’s life, they would still take yours.</p><p>As such, Lu Ming could not be soft-hearted when facing his enemies. The moment he did that, the person who would die would be him.</p><p>After then, Lu Ming started searching through Li Feng and Li Fei’s bodies..</p><p>These two guys were really poor. Their totaled money didn’t add up to fifty taels.</p><p>But a martial arts manual was found on Li Feng’s body.</p><p>The ‘Single Stroke Lightning Sword’ was an Unqualified Level sword technique. Although its grade was not high, it was suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no other methods of attack apart from the Flame Dragon Fist. It just so happened that he could learn a sword art.</p><p>Lu Ming placed the martial arts manual, money, and silver bellflowers into the Supreme Shrine. Then, he exited the cave and followed Li Feng’s directions to the Psammophis Pirates’ den.</p><p>The Psammophis Pirates’ den was on the peak of a mountain that was fifteen kilometers away.</p><p>The peak was surrounded by sheer cliffs on three sides, even demon apes would have a hard time crossing. There was only a narrow path in one direction that ascended the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming spent up to two hours before he got close to the peak.</p><p>On the way there, there were a few times when he was close to encountering demonic beasts. It was a precarious journey.</p><p>Demonic beasts were strong and ruthless. They were categorized into nine Levels, with each Level being divided into nine Grades. As for martial artists, each Realm was also divided into nine Grades, starting from Warrior Realm.</p><p>Even if a demonic beast was the lowest Grade of the lowest Level, it would still be at the same level as a First Grade Warrior Realm martial artist. It was something that Lu Ming could not handle right now.</p><p>Lu Ming was waiting nearby. From what Li Feng said, the Li Family’s Lord, Li Fu, would lead the Li Family’s masters to eliminate the Psammophis Pirates today.</p><p>Of course, it was natural that Li Fu was not so kind-hearted as to eliminate dangers for the people. His goal was the loot plundered by the Psammophis Pirates over the years.</p><p>As expected, over a hundred silhouettes appeared in the mountain forest, charging towards the Psammophis Pirate’s den at a rapid speed.</p><p>“Enemy attack!” A loud yell rang from the peak of the mountain.</p><p>What followed was the intense shouts of conflict.</p><p>“It’s time.” Lu Ming started to move. He traversed through the mountain forest using the Dragon Serpent Steps.</p><p>He swiftly arrived at the rear end of the Psammophic Pirates’ den. There was a hidden route that allowed him to ascend to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>It was the escape route that the Psammophic Pirates left for themselves. If there was ever a day that they could not halt their enemy’s advance, they could retreat from there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
