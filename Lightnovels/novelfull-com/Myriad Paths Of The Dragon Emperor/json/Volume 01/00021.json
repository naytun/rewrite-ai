It would be a simple task to test whether Lu Yao had really supplied Lu Ming’s meridians with blood for three years, then stripped it away from him and fused it with her own blood meridians.</p><p>...</p><p>“Lu Ming, who do you think you are? Do you think we’ll carry the test out just because you say so?” the First Branch Elder quibbled grudgingly.</p><p>The bystanders were not oblivious fools. Would anyone still be ignorant even after noticing the expressions on Lu Yao and the First Branch Elder’s faces?</p><p>What Lu Ming said was more or less the truth.</p><p>At that instant, nearly everyone had a different expression in their eyes as they looked at Lu Yao and the First Branch Elder.</p><p>To supply blood to a meridian and strip it off later was a taboo in the martial arts world as it was considered completely shameless.</p><p>“Lu Yunxiong!”</p><p>At that moment, the seven Core Elders were looking at the First Branch Elder with disappointment in their eyes.</p><p>The eldest Core Elder was particularly furious. “Lu Yunxiong, as the First Branch Elder, how dare you do something so shameless?! How will you be able to face our ancestors? How can we convince the public if you are to continue to hold the position as the First Branch Elder?</p><p>“The Elder Council hereby announces that Lu Yunxiong will be stripped of his position as the First Branch Elder today! The order to name Lu Yao as the Lord of the Lu Family will be rescinded as well!”</p><p>“What? You want to revoke my position as the First Branch Elder? You’d actually strip me of my status for someone as insignificant as Lu Ming? You must remember that Lu Yao already has marital ties with the Duanmu Family!” the First Branch Elder bellowed as he mentioned the Duanmu Family.</p><p>Duanmu Qing had an unpleasant expression on his face as he looked at the seven Core Elders. “It’ll be wise for you to think this through. Since Lu Yao has marital ties with the Duanmu Family, allowing her to take over the Lu Family is the greatest honor you could ever bestow upon your own family. Your family might prosper in the future if you do that, but what you’re doing right now is nothing short of digging your own grave.”</p><p>Duanmu Qing’s words caused a change in the expressions of the seven Core Elders, as well as every other member of the Lu Family.</p><p>They could dismiss Lu Yao and the First Branch Elder, but they had to be mindful of the Duanmu Family who was supporting Lu Yao.</p><p>Since the Duanmu Family was so mighty, obliterating the Lu Family was as easy as flipping a coin for such a major family in the Mystical Sword Sect.</p><p>However, in this situation, if they allowed Lu Yao to succeed as the Family Lord, or even assist Lu Yao in dealing with Lu Ming, the Lu Family would definitely be the butt of all jokes in the Fiery Wind City, or even every city miles away.</p><p>How could they choose?</p><p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p><p>Mu Lan suddenly stood up as she applauded. “How prestigious, Duanmu Qing! Do you think that you can represent the Duanmu Family? Or perhaps that the Duanmu Family can represent the Mystical Sword Sect? Stop pretending to be something you aren’t. I’ll have you know that the Lu Family is under my watch. I’d like to see what the Duanmu Family is capable of!”</p><p>“Mu Lan, you… Are you sure you want to stick your nose into this?” Duanmu Qing’s expression changed.</p><p>“I sure am!” Mu Lan shouted powerfully.</p><p>“Senior Duanmu!”</p><p>Before Duanmu Qing could reply, Lu Yao interrupted him. “Senior Duanmu, I’m willing to join the White Tiger Hall. There’s no use staying in a family like the Lu Family!” she said.</p><p>Duanmu Qing’s eyes sparkled as he smiled. “Not bad! With a family like the Lus which is as widespread as a single palm, there’s no point in staying! With Miss Lu Yao’s talent, you should be aiming for the entire Blazing Sun Empire or an even wider stage than that!” he said.</p><p>1</p><p>Lu Yao nodded and turned to look at Lu Ming whose voice was icy cold as she said, “Lu Yao, if you have the ability to do so, you should kill me today. Otherwise, someday, I’ll return the shame you’ve brought me today by tenfold!”</p><p>2</p><p>“The shame that I’ve brought you?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to chuckle. “That’s hilarious! Everything that happened is because of your own actions. Would today have happened if you hadn’t stripped me of my blood meridians?” he said.</p><p>“Lu Yao, I won’t finish you off. I want you to witness for yourself what you said-that there’s an insurmountable difference between you and me.</p><p>1</p><p>“As for Duanmu Lin, who you call a prodigy, there’ll be a day when you’ll watch with your own eyes as I stomp him into the dirt. Now, get lost.”</p><p>Lu Ming sheathed his blade after his confident and firm voice echoed across the entire field.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s still a long time to go, wait for me. Father, you should come to the Mystical Sword Sect with me along with Brother!” Lu Yao’s cold voice rang out.</p><p>Duanmu Qing had a frosty expression as he looked at Lu Ming with hostility. “Just with you, Lu Ming? You can’t even compare to a single finger of Duanmu Lin’s. I hope that you don’t join the Mystical Sword Sect, or you’ll understand how foolish and arrogant your words were today. Let’s go!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Flame Tigers howled. Lu Yao, the First Branch Elder, and Lu Chuan followed Duanmu Qing and his posse as they mounted the Flame Tigers and left in humiliation without having even packed anything.</p><p>With the departure of Lu Yao and the others, the events of the day finally ended.</p><p>Although the youngsters from the Lu Family had not started the tournament yet, nobody was really paying attention.</p><p>Today’s incident was full of twists and turns, and things had turned out completely different from everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Most of the people originally thought that the star of the day would be Lu Yao.</p><p>They thought that as a genius, she would ascend as the Lord of the Lu Family with more than enough qualifications and bequeath tales of success.</p><p>However, things took a completely different turn because of a single person-Lu Ming-who was the actual star of the day.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming, you’re domineering and confident. Why don’t you come and join the Vermillion Bird Hall and wipe out the genius they call Duanmu Lin in the future?” Mu Lan suggested as she clapped her hands with unconcealed admiration on her face.</p><p>She then added, “However, I won’t agree to any conditions you make. As a martial artist, you have to count on yourself to earn everything.”</p><p>Everyone was speechless. Nobody invited people like that! Would anyone even accept an invitation like that?</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s response made everyone’s jaws drop even further. “Hall Master Mu, I promise to join the Vermillion Bird Hall,” he acquiesced with a nod.</p><p>3</p><p>The main reason that he promised Mu Lan was to thank her for the help.</p><p>Moreover, he wanted to join a powerful sect to cultivate since there would be even more resources in a sect.</p><p>The Mystical Sword Sect was where prodigies from around 2,000 cities in the east of the Blazing Sun Empire gathered. Only by racing against other geniuses to be on the very top of such a wide centerstage would Lu Ming be able to advance even further on the path of martial arts.</p><p>After all, hiding in a corner would never result in great achievements.</p><p>“Excellent!” Mu Lan was ecstatic. Everyone else thought that Lu Ming did not possess a blood meridian, but she had already sensed the power of one within him earlier on.</p><p>Would the Vermillion Bird Hall experience change if a prodigy like him joined the hall?</p><p>“Lu Ming, the only thing that I can assure you after you join the Mystical Sword Sect is that the elders of the Duanmu Family won’t dare to deal with you overtly. However, as for the younger generation of the Duanmu Family, you will have to rely on yourself.”</p><p>With a wave of her hand, a jade credential flew towards Lu Ming. “Lu Ming, proceed to the Vermillion Bird Hall with this jade credential in two months. You’ll be able to join the Vermillion Bird Hall immediately.”</p><p>There was a realistic vermillion bird etched in the jade plate.</p><p>“Thank you, Hall Master Mu!” Lu Ming clasped his fists and kept the jade plate.</p><p>It was enough. As long as the elders of the Duanmu Family did not make a move, it was enough.</p><p>If he could not even go against the younger bunch of the Duanmu Family, what was the point of cultivating martial arts?</p><p>“Heh heh. I’ll be waiting for you in the Mystical Sword Sect, Lu Ming!” Mu Lan smiled daintily as she rose from her seat and left the Lu Family’s training field.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we welcome you to join the Mystical Sword Sect and we hope that you will be a powerhouse of your generation.” Gao Shi and Tie Zhong rose in succession to congratulate Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you, my two seniors. I apologize for not choosing the Azure Dragon Hall and the Onyx Tortoise Hall today.” Lu Ming saluted.</p><p>“Haha, it’s fine!” Gao Shi smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attitude made them feel comfortable.</p><p>1</p><p>The two of them had the same thought in their minds. ‘Not only does Lu Ming have an exceptional latent ability, but he’s also humble and upright. He’ll definitely be successful in the future.’</p><p>“See you in the Mystical Sword Sect, Lu Ming!” Liu Qian smiled.</p><p>Gao Shi, Tie Zhong, and Liu Qian proceeded to leave the area with their respective groups as they were no longer in the mood to spectate the other youngsters of the Lu Family.</p><p>The Lu’s had lost their hype with the departure of the hall envoys, so the ending ceremony was conducted hastily as well.</p><p>However, today’s incident was fated to stir up the entire Fiery Wind City.</p><p>Lu Ming’s reputation would also cause an uproar in the Fiery Wind City. However, it would be the reputation of a prodigy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
