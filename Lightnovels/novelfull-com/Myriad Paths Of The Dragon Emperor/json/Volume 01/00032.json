Ding!</p><p>...</p><p>The blades glimmered in the air as they crossed against each other. Sparks were flying everywhere amidst the intense sounds.</p><p>Both of the youths from the Duanmu Family cultivated Inferior Yellow Level sword techniques. They had only cultivated to the Outstanding Dexterity stage and were far below Lu Ming’s proficiency in sword arts.</p><p>However, their individual cultivation was higher than Lu Ming’s by a whole three Grades. They had the upper hand for a moment as they teamed up together.</p><p>‘I’ll end the injured one first!’</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed like lightning, and an endless stream of the Lustrous Sword Technique swarmed the injured youth.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? He boasts such combat power even though he’s merely on the Sixth Grade Warrior Realm! Such a person cannot live. He must be killed!”</p><p>The two youths from the Duanmu Family were astonished as Lu Ming’s power exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The roars of two beasts rang out. A bloody red glow emanated from the backs of the Duanmu Family’s two youths as two black panthers appeared. There were three red-coloured meridian focal points on the bodies of the black panthers. It was evident that the youths’ blood meridians were Third Level blood meridians.</p><p>The two black panthers then pounced on the respective youths’ bodies. In that instant, black glows drifted out from their body as their Qi increased dramatically.</p><p>It was an eruption of the blood meridian!</p><p>The eruption of their blood meridians increased the two youths’ speed by 30%.</p><p>Blood meridians always had an affinity towards a certain attribute. Some blood meridians would have a higher affinity to defense while others would have a higher affinity to offend, as well as increase speed.</p><p>The attribute that had the affinity would get a boost when a blood meridian erupted.</p><p>Normally, a First Level blood meridian’s eruption would boost an attribute by one-tenth.</p><p>A Second Level blood meridian’s eruption would boost an attribute by two-tenths.</p><p>With that logic, an attribute would increase by 90% when a Ninth Level blood meridian erupted, which was nearly twofold.</p><p>The blood meridians of the Duanmu Family’s youth were partial to speed, which increased by three-tenths after their blood meridians erupted.</p><p>No matter which attribute was boosted, it also implied the increase in combat power.</p><p>Naturally, some higher grade blood meridians would have an affinity for several attributes, which would also mean that those attributes would be boosted in tandem with each other.</p><p>Several attributes being boosted at one time would signify an even more terrifying increase in combat power.</p><p>After their blood meridians erupted, the combat power of the Duanmu Family’s youths increased significantly as they started to crush Lu Ming.</p><p>‘That’s a pity. I can’t make my blood meridian erupt because it hasn’t completely grown yet. I guess that’s my weakness.’ Lu Ming pondered as he battled against the duo with all his might.</p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p><p>In that instant, someone arrived with a swooshing sound once again.</p><p>“Haha, time to die, Lu Ming!”</p><p>It was Wei Ziming and Wei Ziyou.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Wei Ziyou swung his sword before he even arrived. A flash of green Sword Qi burst out from his blade. It was a remote manifestation of Sword Qi which was unbelievably sharp as it was aimed at Lu Ming with the intention to maim.</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ming was enveloped with an urgent sense of danger as every strand of hair on him stood on their ends.</p><p>The Sword Qi of a Master Realm was not something that he could withstand right now.</p><p>He wanted to dodge it but was firmly stopped by the Duanmu Family’s youths.</p><p>Zing!</p><p>At that moment, a sharp sound sounded from the opposite direction. There was another slash of Sword Qi flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>There was another Master Realm martial artist who wanted Lu Ming dead.</p><p>Two Master Realm martial artists were teaming up together, and two youths in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm were blocking Lu Ming’s way. They were driving him into a corner, putting him in a precarious situation.</p><p>‘I’ll enter the Supreme Shrine!’</p><p>If he was not able to withstand it, he could only take shelter in the Supreme Shrine. Although it may ultimately result in the Supreme Shrine being exposed, it was better than getting killed.</p><p>However, his expression immediately changed as he realized that he could no longer enter the Supreme Shrine as it did not react to him in his mind.</p><p>“Could it be that I can’t enter the Supreme Shrine while in battle? Am I going to die here? No, I can’t let myself die!’ Lu Ming screamed in his mind. In that instant, his mind was hyperfocused as his blood boiled. He wanted to find a silver lining in that hopeless situation.</p><p>Suddenly, an intense itch spread as a red beam shot up from his spine. At the same time, a peculiar whoosh of energy surged from his spine into his entire body.</p><p>‘This is the power of a blood meridian. My blood meridian has finally finished growing! Blood meridian eruption!’</p><p>2</p><p>Without any time to think things through, Lu Ming immediately made his blood meridian erupt. A black glow started to spread across his body.</p><p>Zing! Zing!</p><p>It was at that moment that the two Sword Qi slashed across Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Two sharp energies penetrated his body the moment the Sword Qi hit him. An intense round of pain spread all over him as a mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth.</p><p>‘The Sword Qi’s power seemed to have diminished by half!’</p><p>Lu Ming could instantly sense that the power of the Sword Qi that landed on him was halved. If it were in full power, there was no chance that he could have handled it.</p><p>‘Could it be because of my blood meridian?’</p><p>He racked his brains for a second, but there was no time for second thoughts. Lu Ming took a step forward and darted towards the wounded youth from the Duanmu Family like a gust of wind.</p><p>The youth from the Duanmu Family did not expect Lu Ming to be still alive after being hit by the Sword Qi from the two Master Realm martial artists. He wanted to defend himself, but it was too late.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>A sword slid across the youth’s throat like a bolt of light as blood squirted everywhere. Lu Ming’s figure darted ahead in a flash as he used the Dragon Serpent Steps.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill a disciple from the Duanmu Family!? You’re courting death!” someone screamed in a frenzy.</p><p>Lu Ming took a hurried glance and saw who the furious yell came from.</p><p>It was one of the Master Realm martial artists that had made a move. With rosewood patterns sewn onto the hems of his sleeves, he was evidently a young disciple of the Duanmu Family.</p><p>“Duanmu Family, I swear that I will eventually raze you to the ground.”</p><p>The murderous impulse within Lu Ming was thick as he flitted onwards while forcefully bracing against his own injuries.</p><p>“Follow him!”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, Wei Ziyou and the martial master from the Duanmu Family were in hot pursuit.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had cultivated the Dragon Serpent Steps to the Fifth Stage, so he could traverse over three meters in a single step at a speed that outmatched even a First Grade Master Realm.</p><p>Wei Ziyou and the other person had no chance of catching up with Lu Ming.</p><p>After half an hour, Lu Ming managed to throw them off his scent. Then, he found a cave and darted into it.</p><p>Huff! Huff!</p><p>He gasped for air as he sat in the cave. His body was pulsing with pain. Although he had blocked the Sword Qi from the two Master Realm martial artists, the injuries that he had sustained were not light.</p><p>‘Let’s see if I can enter the Supreme Shrine now!’</p><p>At the thought of that, Lu Ming’s body disappeared and reappeared in the Supreme Shrine.</p><p>‘Could it be that I can’t enter the Supreme Shrine when in battle or in danger? Why is that?’</p><p>Unable to figure it out, Lu Ming was rendered speechless. It seemed that it would be impossible to hide from danger in the Supreme Shrine. He needed to rely on himself.</p><p>‘Let’s focus on nursing my injuries!’</p><p>Lu Ming started to nurse his wounds as he sat on his knees and started to recite the True War Dragon Technique.</p><p>Soon, he recovered from his injuries after three days.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind entered his spine. There was a radiant beam of red with a black worm the size of a finger that manifested within the light.</p><p>The worm was limbless, but it shone with a brilliant black as if it was made from powdered black jade.</p><p>‘Is this my blood meridian? Why isn’t there even a single meridian focal point?’ Lu Ming was speechless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
