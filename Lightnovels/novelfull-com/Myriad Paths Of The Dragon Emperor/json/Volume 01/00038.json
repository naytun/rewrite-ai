One of them was the Spirit-condensing Fruit, and the other two were the Lightning Leopard’s blood and the Blood Mist Rocks.</p><p>1</p><p>Lu Ming definitely needed to obtain the Lightning Leopard’s blood.</p><p>Soon, the two White Tiger Hall apprentices got up and journeyed ahead after they were done eating.</p><p>“Let’s follow them!” Lu Ming said to Feng Wu who nodded and snuck behind the two White Tiger Hall’s apprentices with him.</p><p>A few kilometers into the journey, the two White Tiger Hall apprentices lit a handful of dry grass, and billows of white smoke spread into the woods.</p><p>At the same time, the same white smoke appeared from a few other directions. Only the north side was clear from the white smoke.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Not long after that, a silvery-white shadow darted out from the woods and dashed northwards.</p><p>‘It really is a Lightning Leopard!’ Lu Ming thought.</p><p>Clearly, the Lightning Leopard was afraid of the white smoke, so it ran towards the area that was clear of smoke.</p><p>“The Lightning Leopard is out! Let’s corner it towards that canyon over there!” A loud voice rang out as silhouettes headed towards the leopard’s direction.</p><p>The two White Tiger Hall’s apprentices followed suit with Lu Ming and Feng Wu close on their tail.</p><p>After a while, a canyon was in sight. Four people were guarding the entrance of the canyon while the Lightning Leopard and the rest of the people were nowhere to be seen. They might have entered the canyon earlier on.</p><p>“Let’s check it out!” Lu Ming grinned and made his way towards the canyon.</p><p>“Stop! The Duanmu Family has business here. Get the f*ck out of here!” one of the four Duanmu disciples ordered as Lu Ming and Feng Wu came near.</p><p>“Last I recall, the Midnight Hills don’t belong to the Duanmu Family. Who are you to tell me where I should go?” A cold smile hung on Lu Ming’s face as he took long strides towards the canyon.</p><p>“How dare you, you brat?! Are you looking for trouble?” the same Duanmu disciple roared. He looked carefully at Lu Ming as recognition flashed through his eyes and he cried out, “I remember! You’re Lu Ming! Haha, of all the places you choose to go, you had to come here. Now then, leave your head here!”</p><p>He unsheathed his sword and attacked Lu Ming right away.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming’s sword was faster as it went through the Duanmu disciple’s chest in a poof.</p><p>That Duanmu disciple was only in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm and was no match for him at all.</p><p>“You…you killed a Duanmu disciple! That’s it! You’re finished!” The other three guarding the canyon paled and cried out in disbelief.</p><p>They were not disciples of the Duanmu Family. They were one of White Tiger Hall’s new apprentices with much lower cultivation levels at only the Seventh and Eight Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>Swoosh swoosh!</p><p>Another beam of sword light shone and sliced through their throats.</p><p>It was Feng Wu.</p><p>The three White Tiger Hall’s disciples fell to the ground, their eyes bulging without any breath left in their bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Feng Wu in surprise as he did not expect her to also kill without hesitation.</p><p>1</p><p>“Let’s see if they have point-worthy metal pieces on them.”</p><p>Carefully devouring their essence in concealment, Lu Ming searched all four bodies. However, essence from a Warrior Realm martial artist was of little use to him.</p><p>Alas, Lu Ming and Feng Wu found a total of 26 points on them, so they divvied them up to 13 points each.</p><p>They continued to make way towards the canyon.</p><p>The canyon was at least a thousand meters tall with smooth, marble-like rock linings on both sides. No wonder the Duanmu disciples had chased the Lightning Leopard here.</p><p>In this canyon, no matter how fast the Lightning Leopard was, it could not escape.</p><p>At the end of the thousand-meter canyon, smooth marble-like rock linings surrounded the space too.</p><p>Five people were surrounding a white fur ball in the middle. The white furball was a Lightning Leopard cub which was as small as a dog. Its fur was as white as snow with strands of lightning buzzing through its body.</p><p>Blood soaked the leopard cub’s fur. It laid on the ground wounded while it observed its surroundings with sad, helpless eyes.</p><p>“Be careful. We need it alive. Just injuring it will do. This Lightning Leopard’s meant to be given to Young Master Lin as a pet so he can extract the leopard’s blood for cultivation every month,” a young man instructed.</p><p>Judging by his clothing, he was undoubtedly a Duanmu disciple, and he was the only one out of the five.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Brother Duanmu! What matters to Young Master Lin is of my topmost priority!”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>The other four chimed in agreement.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, they heard footsteps approaching, and when they turned around and found Lu Ming and Feng Wu, their expressions changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming? What’re you doing here?!” the Duanmu disciple cried out in bewilderment.</p><p>“Why can’t I be here?” Lu Ming answered with a faint smile.</p><p>“The people at the canyon’s entrance…what did you do to them?” the Duanmu disciple questioned sternly.</p><p>“Killed them, of course!” Lu Ming answered nonchalantly.</p><p>“What?! You killed them? You b*stard! Everyone, he’s wronged the Duanmu Family. Let’s kill him!” the Duanmu disciple bellowed.</p><p>“I’ll slaughter him!” A gray-robed young man flew out as he pummelled his fist towards Lu Ming’s head, intending to make Lu Ming’s head explode with a punch.</p><p>The wind whistled as the gray-robed young man’s fist cut through the air, accompanied by the explosion of his First Grade Master Realm’s Essential Qi.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With one foot stomping heavily on the ground, Lu Ming shot out like an arrow. His sword flashed as quickly as a shooting star.</p><p>Pfff! The gray-robed young man had a deep laceration across his chest as Lu Ming’s sword punctured his heart, slicing it into half.</p><p>“You…” That was all the young man could utter before he collapsed and died.</p><p>Lu Ming killed a First Grade Master Realm expert in just one move.</p><p>The other four of them could not believe their eyes. “Guys, let’s slaughter him altogether!” the Duanmu disciple exploded.</p><p>Boom! Boom! …</p><p>All four of them made their blood meridians explode.</p><p>The Duanmu disciple had a Fourth Level blood meridian while the other three had Third Level blood meridians.</p><p>They were all in First Grade Master Realm.</p><p>CREATORS’ THOUGHTS</p><p>Riise</p><p>From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren’t selected will be refunded within 30 days.
