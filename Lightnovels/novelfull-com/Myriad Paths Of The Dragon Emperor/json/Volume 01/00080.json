In a casual battle, he was as unmoving as a mountain. His aura was oppressive, and his eyes were filled with killing intent, like a Wolf or a Tiger.</p><p>it’s really Yao Tianyu. He’s here personally.</p><p>Low exclamations spread out in the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. So this teenager was Yao Tianyu.</p><p>“I heard you, but why should I stop?” he said calmly, his face still calm.</p><p>“How dare you speak to senior brother Yao like that?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s with your attitude?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, a few youths from the law enforcement Hall shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and could not be bothered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you attacked a fellow disciple for no reason. Your methods are vicious and vicious. You’re simply insane. This is a serious violation of the sect rules. Now, you’re going to chain yourself and follow us back to the law enforcement Hall to accept your punishment!”</p><p>A young man in a red robe walked out and shouted. Then, with a clang, he threw a thick chain in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, surrender and listen to the punishment.”</p><p>The other youths from the Tribunal Council also shouted.</p><p>“I broke the sect rules?”</p><p>“Why don’t you ask me why I made a move?” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>you don’t have to ask much about this. Anyway, we saw you attack and severely injure your fellow disciples. You even destroyed the star Moon Tower. This is a serious crime.</p><p>The red-robed youth concluded.</p><p>hehe, let me tell you now that I am not guilty. I am only punishing the sect’s vermin. The star Moon Tower used an extremely low price to forcefully buy the materials of the new disciples. Once they refused, they would deal a heavy blow. One of my friends is still unconscious. Why don’t you guys investigate this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Nonsense, he’s slandering us. There’s no such thing. Senior brother Yao, you have to help me.”</p><p>Chen Yuexing’s cultivation level was high, so she didn’t faint. She cried out loudly.</p><p>“Slander? Do you think the others are blind?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The red-robed young man turned to the young men from the Vermillion Bird Hall and said,”Who among you saw the star Moon Tower forcefully buying materials? He even attacked and injured someone? But I’m warning you, you’d better think carefully before you speak. Don’t talk nonsense, be careful of trouble coming from your mouth.”</p><p>A threat. This was an undisguised threat.</p><p>The new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were about to tell the truth, but their expressions changed when they heard this.</p><p>As for Yao Tianyu, he stood at the side. Although he did not say anything, his aura was overbearing. When he casually swept his gaze over the crowd, the disciples ‘faces turned even uglier.</p><p>For a moment, no one dared to speak.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s lips curled into a sneer. The other disciples of the Tribunal Council followed suit.</p><p>The red-robed youth said,”Lu Ming, it seems like no one can testify for you. What else do you have to say now?” Why aren’t you surrendering?”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and swept his gaze across the new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples. When they saw Lu Ming’s gaze, they blushed and lowered their heads in shame.</p><p>But still, no one spoke.</p><p>“Lu Ming, What are you looking at? Was he trying to threaten them? With the Tribunal Council here, don’t even think about it. Why don’t you surrender? Was he trying to resist? Brothers, get ready to attack!”</p><p>The red-robed young man shouted, his eyes flashing with ruthlessness.</p><p>A few days ago, he went to summon Lu Ming and was thrown out of the door by Lu Ming. He regarded it as a great humiliation.</p><p>“Law enforcement Hall? What Bullsh * t enforcement hall, I’ve learned something today. If you want to make a move, then do it. It’s impossible for me to surrender! I, Lu Ming, am not afraid of a battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long sword in his hand and stood proudly. His slender figure was like a tall and Straight Mountain peak, full of unyielding and unswerving determination.</p><p>Before he came here today, he had already thought that Yao Tianyu might be behind all this, even though he knew that he had almost no chance of winning against those on the bronze list with his current cultivation.</p><p>But he still came and did it. This was his heart. He would do what he wanted to do and what he should do.</p><p>At worst, they would just fight a bloody battle.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s figure, the new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples felt even more ashamed.</p><p>“Wait … Wait a minute!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>The skinny young man who was saved by Lu Ming earlier clenched his fists tightly. His face was flushed and his body was trembling. He strode out.</p><p>“I can be a witness. What senior brother Lu Ming said is true. The star Moon Tower forcefully bought the materials of the Vermillion Bird Hall’s new disciples. They only gave one tael of silver for the thousand taels ‘worth of items. If they don’t obey, they will give them a good beating.”</p><p>there was a senior who refused to obey. He argued with Chen Yuexing and Chen Yuexing broke his bones. He was seriously injured and fell unconscious. Senior brother Lu Ming only attacked because he stood up for us. He did not break any sect rules. Don’t …</p><p>The skinny youth shouted, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>“Shut up, How dare you!”</p><p>The red-robed young man suddenly shouted, interrupting the skinny young man’s next words.</p><p>He then stared coldly at the skinny youth and said in a deep voice, ” “Brat, How dare you! I can tell that you’re Lu Ming’s accomplice. How dare you help Lu Ming to bring disaster to the sect? you even tried to deceive the law enforcement Hall. Your crime is unforgivable. Today, you’re with Lu Ming, so you can’t escape your punishment!”</p><p>The skinny young man’s face turned pale and his voice trembled, ” “No, you can’t do this. I’m telling the truth.”</p><p>“No need to talk nonsense, attack!”</p><p>At this moment, Yao Tianyu finally opened his mouth. He was decisive and direct.</p><p>“Junior Brother, you should step back!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and essential Qi gushed out. The thin teenager retreated into the crowd.</p><p>Lu Ming was facing the law enforcement Hall alone.</p><p>He didn’t say anything, but the unyielding battle intent on his body explained everything.</p><p>Fight, fight to the end!</p><p>“Let’s attack together and take down Lu Ming. It’s fine as long as we don’t kill him.”</p><p>The red-robed youth shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At that moment, more than ten youths from the law enforcement Hall pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword Qi, palm wind, and fist force instantly enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>The disciples of the Tribunal Council were all very strong. Even the weakest of them was a sixth grade master realm.</p><p>“Ultimate flowing light!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword rang out, and the sword light burst forth. The sword Qi burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming charged into the crowd.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sounds of clashing and explosions rang out. Then, a few figures retreated.</p><p>It was the disciples of the Tribunal Council. They had all been stabbed in the chest with a wound that went straight to their bones. They fell heavily to the ground and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was too domineering. Not only did he start a war with the people of the law enforcement Hall, but he also injured a few experts of the law enforcement Hall in one move.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong.</p><p>One had to know that there were many eighth grade master realm experts in the Tribunal Council.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>The red-robed young man shouted from the side.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More enforcement Hall disciples rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, there were over thirty enforcement Palace disciples.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared with an imposing manner.</p><p>He had his eyes on the red-robed disciple and rushed in that direction.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
