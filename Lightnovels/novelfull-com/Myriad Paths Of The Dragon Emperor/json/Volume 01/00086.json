The only difference was in the way the spear was used. The only difference was in the degree of maturity and comprehension.</p><p>After observing it carefully, Lu Ming began to cultivate.</p><p>At the end of the stairs, there was a faintly discernible Palace. The sound of chanting continuously rang out, clearing Lu Ming’s mind. He quickly comprehended the martial arts technique.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>The sound of the spear piercing through the air, as well as the vibration of the spear itself, resounded throughout the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He cultivated like this for half a month.</p><p>In the forest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved unhindered. The fire-patterned spear danced in his hands, like a fire Dragon rolling.</p><p>Wuwuwuwuwu …</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thrust his spear.</p><p>“Fire gun art-broken armor!”</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air with unparalleled speed, like a bolt of lightning, stabbing towards a two-meter-tall Boulder.</p><p>At the tip of the spear, a spinning cutting force was produced.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The huge rock was pierced through by the fire pattern spear like it was tofu.</p><p>“Fire gun art-mountain crash!”</p><p>&Nbsp; suddenly, the fire patterned spear shook, and the body of the spear flickered, creating a vibrating force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge rock exploded right in the middle, sending debris flying.</p><p>I’ve finally reached the first level of the fire gun art. I’ve just gotten a glimpse of it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with joy.</p><p>As expected of a black grade low level martial arts technique, it was extremely powerful. Lu Ming felt that its power had already surpassed the lustrous sword technique even though he had only cultivated the first stage.</p><p>After all, the lustrous sword technique had been stuck at the fifth level, and it was difficult to break through.</p><p>The first level of the fire gun technique was equivalent to the sixth level of the lustrous sword technique.</p><p>Generally speaking, it was very difficult to successfully cultivate a black level martial skill without the cultivation of a great Martial Master.</p><p>For example, the Zhu family’s patriarch, Zhu Bing, had only managed to cultivate to the first level after decades of cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, had cultivated to the first level in just half a month.</p><p>This was inseparable from the effect of the chanting.</p><p>Of course, without Lu Ming’s hard work in cultivating the basic gun technique a month ago, it would be impossible for him to master the fire gun control technique so quickly.</p><p>Then, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on a green rock, frowning in deep thought.</p><p>“It’s still lacking a little. It doesn’t feel very smooth!”</p><p>After this period of cultivation, he realized that he was still a little bit short of comprehending the essence of the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>If he cultivated in this way, even with the help of the chanting, the cultivation progress would not reach the level that Lu Ming was satisfied with.</p><p>maybe it’s because of the environment. The fire gun art belongs to the fire attribute. I should go to a place full of fire attribute spiritual Qi to cultivate, then I can be like a fish in water. That way, combined with the chanting sound, I can improve faster.</p><p>“Where’s the fire-attributed spiritual Qi? Oh, right, the southern ridge fire field!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he thought of a place.</p><p>The southern ridge fire field was in the southwest of the mystical sword sect. It was an area where volcanoes erupted. The volcanoes covered a radius of a thousand miles, and it was filled with flames and fire-type spiritual Qi.</p><p>It was perfect for him to practice the fire gun controlling art there.</p><p>The key was that that area not only had a large number of fire-attribute demonic beasts, but it also produced a spiritual herb called flame crystal grass.</p><p>Flame crystal grass was one of the precious materials required to cultivate the third stage of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>This was a material that was more precious than the spirit-condensing fruit and the blood mist rock. If he were to exchange for it at the mystical sword sect, Lu Ming estimated that it would cost at least ten to twenty thousand contribution points.</p><p>Going to the Southridge fire field was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately returned to the mystical sword sect to visit pang Shi.</p><p>After such a long time, pang Shi had already recovered and was even more diligent in his cultivation.</p><p>Seeing that pang Shi was fine, Lu Ming was relieved. He then exchanged some detox pills and essential Qi recovery pills with his contribution points and headed to the Southridge fire field.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming caught a fourth grade second level Gale Lion.</p><p>The speed of the wind travel Lion was extremely fast, much faster than the green scale horse.</p><p>Five days later, Lu Ming arrived at the Lingnan fire field.</p><p>They could already feel waves of hot air blowing against their faces before they even entered the southern ridge fire field.</p><p>After releasing the wind-walking lion, Lu Ming walked into the Southridge fire field.</p><p>There were no volcanoes in the periphery of the Lingnan fire field. The ground was pitch black, like burnt rocks.</p><p>Hot air was rising from the ground.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>Sometimes, a gas would rush out of the ground. It was extremely hot, and ordinary people would be scalded if they touched it.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming entered, he would occasionally see some figures.</p><p>These people had a name-stone hunters.</p><p>There were many volcanoes in the center of the southern ridge fire field. When these volcanoes erupted, they would spew out a type of ore called Inferno stone.</p><p>Inferno stone could be refined into Inferno iron, and it was the best material for forging spirit weapons.</p><p>However, those who would come here to pick up stones were usually itinerant cultivators with low cultivation, and there were even ordinary people.</p><p>The Lingnan fire field was full of danger. The ground would spew out hot gases, lava, and flames from time to time. Even a martial arts master would be severely injured or even killed if he was hit by the flames.</p><p>As for Inferno ore, it was just an ore and wasn’t expensive. Therefore, those with high cultivation rarely came here.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stay long in the outer area.</p><p>He wanted to go to the central region, where there were many fire-type demonic beasts and the fire-type spiritual Qi was stronger. That was the place for cultivation.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming passed through the outer area and arrived at the central area.</p><p>In the central region, the air was even hotter, as if they were in a big steamer.</p><p>The stones on the ground were all fiery red, and one could even hear a ‘pop’ sound.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and could occasionally see lava gushing out of the ground.</p><p>This area was even more dangerous, and almost no one came here.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential Qi throughout his body to resist the heat from the outside world. At the same time, he was fully focused on observing the situation on the ground.</p><p>This was to prevent them from being hit by the lava.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
