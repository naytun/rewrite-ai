Lu Ming had broken six of them consecutively, leaving only the last two pillars.</p><p>Even with the support of the two walls, the star Moon Tower started to shake violently, making cracking sounds.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you should die. You should die.”</p><p>A furious roar came from the third floor, and then a few figures jumped down.</p><p>“It’s Chen Yuexing. The leader of the star Moon Alliance, Chen Yuexing, has finally come out.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>At this moment, Chen Yuexing’s face was twisted. She glared at Lu Ming and shouted, ” Lu Ming, how dare you destroy the star Moon Tower. Today, I will break every bone in your body and break every vein in your body. I will turn you into a useless person, a useless person who is worse than a pig or a dog.</p><p>Lu Ming’s means were completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had thought that no matter how strong Lu Ming was, it would take some effort for him to beat Liu Wei and the rest. By then, Yao Tianyu had already arrived with the people from the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>However, he had never expected that Lu Ming’s combat strength had far exceeded his expectations. At the same time, his ruthlessness and boldness had completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to tear down the star Moon Tower.</p><p>This was his blood, sweat, and tears, so he had no choice but to show himself.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word. He only looked at Chen Yuexing coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I don’t mind telling you this. I was the one who broke all the bones in your friend’s body. Now, I’m going to let you go and accompany your friend.”</p><p>Chen Yuexing’s face was twisted with killing intent. The aura from her body was as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>Late eighth grade master realm.</p><p>This was Chen Yuexing’s strength. She was extremely powerful, much more powerful than Ning Feng. Otherwise, she would not have been able to open the star Moon Tower and control the star Moon Alliance.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, the Vermillion Bird Hall’s new apprentices were suppressed by this aura. Their faces turned pale and they retreated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I admit that you’re very powerful. However, it’s still too early for you to challenge me. Today, I’ll teach you how to be a human for free. You must keep a low profile. When you meet someone you can’t defeat, you must tuck your tail between your legs and behave.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As she spoke, Chen Yuexing’s aura grew even stronger.</p><p>Chen Yuexing’s bloodline was at the fourth level.</p><p>At this moment, Chen Yuexing’s strength had reached the peak of the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>“Lightning claw!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Chen Yuexing took a step forward and with a Swoosh, she was in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The claws that were as sharp as knives clawed at Lu Ming wildly.</p><p>In an instant, he had struck out at least twenty times.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was faster. The sound of a sword rang out. In an instant, dozens of sword lights bloomed from Lu Ming’s hands. It was extremely dazzling.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The sword Qi whistled, the claw force crossed, and a strong wind gushed out in all directions.</p><p>The new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples nearby kept retreating.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Some of the Qi flew out and hit the walls of the star Moon Tower, causing the star Moon Tower to shake even more.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a scream and a figure retreated.</p><p>It was Chen Yuexing.</p><p>A deep sword gash appeared on his shoulder, almost cutting off one of his arms.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all shocked.</p><p>In less than ten moves, Chen Yuexing had been defeated and forced to retreat with heavy injuries.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Chen Yuexing roared. His heart was twitching in fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The few young men who were with him rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Chen Yuexing, she was actually running away.</p><p>He wanted to escape.</p><p>“Chen Yuexing, don’t even think about running!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. His sword glowed brightly and it was extremely sharp.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The few young men were instantly sent flying. They flew far away and crashed heavily into the wall of the star Moon Tower.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>This time, the star Moon Tower could no longer hold on and collapsed.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Some of the disciples of the four courtyards who were close to him turned pale with fright and quickly retreated.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire Star Moon Tower collapsed, stirring up dust.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was as fast as lightning as he dashed toward Chen Yuexing.</p><p>Chen Yuexing was severely injured and her speed was greatly reduced. In a few breaths, Lu Ming had caught up to her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait a minute. We can discuss this further. What do you want? I can give you anything.”</p><p>Seeing that she could not escape, Chen Yuexing stopped and started to plead. At the same time, she wanted to use her ‘benefits’ to stabilize Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, he kept thinking, ” “Soon, soon. Senior brother Yao Tianyu and the others will be here soon. When they arrive, Lu Ming, I’ll see how you die. I want revenge, I want revenge ten times, a hundred times more.”</p><p>“What do I want?”</p><p>The cold smile on Lu Ming’s lips grew wider. what I want is very simple. I just want you to use twice the amount of what you have used on my brother, pang Shi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He threw a punch at Chen Yuexing’s stomach. With a crack, a few of her ribs were broken. She was sent flying and coughed up blood.</p><p>“Next, it’s your four limbs!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he walked to Chen Yuexing’s side.</p><p>“No, don’t!”</p><p>Chen Yuexing shouted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this time, a furious roar suddenly came from the distance.</p><p>At the same time-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another rushed over.</p><p>“The enforcement Palace, it’s the people from the enforcement Palace.”</p><p>“The leader is Yao Tianyu,”</p><p>it’s over. This time, Lu Ming is finished.</p><p>The surrounding senior disciples cried out in surprise when they saw these people rushing over.</p><p>Of course, some people were surprised, a few were worried, but most of them were gloating.</p><p>The Tribunal Council was established by the four great halls. Each Hall would select a few people to join the Tribunal Council to maintain the order of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, the enforcement Hall is here. Let’s go.”</p><p>The skinny teenager who was saved by Lu Ming earlier shouted.</p><p>“Hahaha, the people from the Tribunal Council are here. Senior brother Yao Tianyu is here. Lu Ming, you’re finished. How dare you break my ribs? I’ll make you pay ten times or a hundred times more.”</p><p>Chen Yuexing’s arrogance was completely restored as soon as the people from the Tribunal Council arrived. She called out coldly.</p><p>“Law enforcement Hall? Hehe, no one will be able to save you today.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were still cold. He was unmoved. He raised his foot and stomped on Chen Yuexing’s leg.</p><p>The arrogance on Chen Yuexing’s face disappeared and was replaced by endless fear. She wailed,”No, don’t …”</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his foot heavily on Chen Yuexing’s leg. The bone in her leg was broken into several pieces by Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>“Ah, ah, my leg! Senior brother Yao, save me!”</p><p>Chen Yuexing wailed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s legs were as fast as lightning and he stomped two more times.</p><p>These two feet were on Chen Yuexing’s other leg and arm.</p><p>Chen Yuexing’s leg and hand bones broke into several pieces.</p><p>At this moment, the people from the law enforcement Hall finally arrived and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
