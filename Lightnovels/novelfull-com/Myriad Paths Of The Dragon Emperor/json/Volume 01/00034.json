Swoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment, several sounds pierced the silence around Lu Ming as figures appeared from the sides, his front, back, and left flank.</p><p>Wei Ziyou and Wei Ziming stood in front of Lu Ming while there were four members of the Duanmu Family behind him. Apart from the young martial artist of Master Realm, there were another three youths.</p><p>To his left, there was a youth donned in a brocade garb who was emanating a strong aura. He was a Master Realm expert.</p><p>The moment they spotted Lu Ming, the people from these three sides formed a circle with him in the middle.</p><p>Three of them were in First Grade Master Realm while the other three were on the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm. Wei Ziming could be dismissed as a non-factor.</p><p>“Let’s see where you can run to now, Lu Ming,” Wei Ziming said as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming casually glanced at Wei Ziming. “You piece of trash, have a duel with me if you’ve got what it takes!” He laughed.</p><p>“You’re a dead man walking, Lu Ming. I shan’t bother to have a dispute with a dead man!” Wei Ziming snarled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to kill a disciple of my family, the Duanmu Family?! You’re courting death!” the young Master Realm martial artist from the Duanmu Family insulted.</p><p>“I’m courting death? Your family wanted me dead first. The way you put it, I guess I can only die without retaliating, huh?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right. My Duanmu Family wants you dead, so there’s nothing you can do except to accept your fate. How could a lowly scum like you compare to the lives of the Duanmu Family’s disciples?” The Duanmu Family’s youth scoffed. He was confident, arrogant, and unreasonable.</p><p>“Hehe!” Lu Ming smiled. He did not bother to squabble with someone like him. “And what about you? I don’t think I know you. Are you someone from the Duanmu Family as well?” he said as he shifted his gaze towards the youth in the brocade garb.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, since you’re about to meet your end, I’ll let you in on this. Senior Brother Ning Feng sent me. You’re as bold as brass to offend Senior Brother Ning Feng when you’ve just joined. Are you tired of living?” The youth in the brocade garb smiled. “Alright, stop spouting nonsense with him. Let’s kill him now. I don’t have the time to squabble with him.”</p><p>He was Duanmu Fei. As he finished speaking in an icy tone, he charged towards Lu Ming in a frenzy. A green Sword Qi pierced through the air with a sharp whistle.</p><p>Wei Ziyou and the youth in the brocade garb did not make a move, as they thought that one person was enough to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his feet on the group as Duanmu Fei’s Sword Qi was about to land on him. He used the Dragon Serpent Steps and dodged the Sword Qi before darting away like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>His target was the youth of the Duanmu Family who was in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His blade whistled as a beam of Sword Qi was sent flying.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation at top Eighth Grade Warrior Realm, the youth from the Duanmu Family was unable to avoid Lu Ming’s Sword Qi even if he was on full alert.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>The blade directly pierced the youth’s heart.</p><p>It was a kill in a single blow!</p><p>‘Devour!’</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming’s mind, a strong pull gravitated from his palms, pulling out nine droplets of blood essence from his opponents’ wound. It traveled across Lu Ming’s arm and was devoured by the Spirit-Devouring Worm.</p><p>This was the method of using the Spirit-Devouring Worm that Lu Ming had figured out over these few days. He could apply the devouring aura on his hands and silently absorb the blood essence of others.</p><p>“Ah! Lu Ming, you’re looking for death!” Duanmu Fei bellowed furiously as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>An icy smile formed on Lu Ming’s lips. He did not go head-on against Duanmu Fei, and he used the Dragon Serpent Steps to charge towards another youth who was in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>With the Spirit-Devouring Worm continuously refining the blood essence at the same time, a surge of energy poured into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The energy contained within the blood essence of someone in Ninth Grade Warrior Realm was immense, allowing Lu Ming to increase his cultivation at a mind-boggling speed.</p><p>His cultivation was already at top Eighth Grade Warrior Realm, but it constantly closed the distance to Ninth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Although the youth from the Duanmu Family tried his best to avoid it, his speed was incomparable to Lu Ming’s. He was instantly killed with a flash of the blade.</p><p>Lu Ming absorbed his blood essence at the same time.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>With the surging Essential Qi from the blood essence of the two Ninth Grade Warrior Realm experts, Lu Ming finally broke free from his shackles and made another breakthrough. His cultivation reached the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm instantly.</p><p>“Damn it! What are you two waiting for? Start making a move together and destroy Lu Ming!” Duanmu Fei howled.</p><p>Within these few days, a total of three people on the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm from the Duanmu Family had fallen to the hands of Lu Ming. Youngsters who were in the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm below the age of eighteen were considered elites, even in the Duanmu Family. After the three of them died in one go, he had no idea how to explain it to the seniors of the Duanmu Family when he returned. That was why he loathed Lu Ming from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>“End him!”</p><p>Wei Ziyou and the youth in brocade screamed as they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Since Lu Ming killed two experts on the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm in one go, his prowess had exceeded their expectations. Their dignity was the last thing on their minds as they formed an alliance.</p><p>Duanmu Fei and Wei Ziyou sent a flash of Sword Qi flying while youth in the brocade garb unleashed a golden palm.</p><p>A sharp whistling sound could be heard as they teamed up and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, a brilliant move! Let’s see how strong Master Realm is!” Lu Ming chuckled. His confidence skyrocketed as his cultivation broke through to the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lu Ming darted towards Duanmu Fei with a twist of his body without caring about the attacks from Wei Ziyou and the youth in the brocade garb coming from behind him.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The trio’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.</p><p>“Blood meridian eruption!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s blood meridian erupted as a layer of dark light glistened brilliantly.</p><p>It was also the same moment that the attacks from Wei Ziyou and the others landed on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, they were bewildered when they did not see Lu Ming die. His body merely swayed for a moment, but the sword in his hand did not stop. It darted out like a surge of lightning and pierced through Duanmu Fei’s heart.</p><p>Not even in his wildest dreams did Duanmu Fei expect Lu Ming to survive attacks from three people and even manage to make a counterattack. He was unable to dodge in time even if he wanted to.</p><p>Lu Ming pierced his heart in a poof. His sight turned black as he fell heavily onto the floor.</p><p>Duanmu Fei died!</p><p>1</p><p>‘There’s still two breaths left!’</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning as he sliced his sword towards the youth in the brocade garb.</p><p>“Ah! Die!”</p><p>The youth in the brocade garb almost lost his nerves when he witnessed Duanmu Fei’s death. He then unleashed two consecutive strikes from his palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming recklessly allowed the strikes to land on his body. Without even pausing for a moment, the blade in his hand sliced through the throat of the youth in the brocade garb.</p><p>Blood went spurting everywhere from the clean slice across the youth’s throat. His hands grasped at his neck as his eyes were wide with mixed emotions, including dissatisfaction, pleading, and hate.</p><p>“Retreat! Hurry!” Wei Ziyou howled in terror from the side. When Lu Ming successively killed two experts in Master Realm, Wei Ziyou lost his courage and fled in horror.</p><p>“Don’t you think it’s too late to leave now?” An icy smile hung on Lu Ming’s face as he pursued Wei Ziyou with a twist of his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
