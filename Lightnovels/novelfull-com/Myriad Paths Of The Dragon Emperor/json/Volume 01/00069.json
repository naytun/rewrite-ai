Wasn’t it called the fire gun technique?</p><p>He still remembered the power of that spear art!</p><p>He opened it with some anticipation. At first glance, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>A profound rank martial skill. This spear technique was actually a profound rank martial skill.</p><p>Black grade low level martial arts technique, fire gun technique.</p><p>no wonder it’s so powerful. It’s actually a black rank martial arts technique. I’m going to hit the jackpot.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>A black grade martial skill was many times more precious than a yellow grade martial skill.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to read it. The more he read, the more shocked he was.</p><p>what a powerful force. There’s no way to compare it with a yellow grade martial skill. The difference is like heaven and earth. That Zhu Bing has probably only cultivated it to the first level and has only just glimpsed the door.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Generally speaking, as long as one could cultivate a black grade low level martial arts technique to the first level, its power would be comparable to the sixth level of a yellow grade high level martial arts technique.</p><p>The first level was already comparable to the sixth level of a yellow grade high level martial arts technique. One could only imagine how powerful a black grade martial arts technique was.</p><p>But at the same time, the difficulty of cultivating black level martial arts techniques was many times more difficult than yellow level martial arts techniques. It was difficult for a normal master realm warrior to successfully cultivate it.</p><p>Unless he was a top genius.</p><p>Zhu Bing had trained hard for decades, but he had only managed to cultivate to the first level.</p><p>I wonder how many contribution points it would cost to exchange for a black rank martial arts technique in the mystic essence sword sect’s library. It’s a pity that it’s a spear technique, and I’m a sword practitioner, so I can’t cultivate it.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened and then lit up. He muttered, ” “Who said I’m a swordsman? The true war Dragon technique that I’ve been cultivating has produced Dragon-shaped true Qi, and my spear is like a dragon. Perhaps, I’ve been going in the wrong direction all this time!”</p><p>Since he was young, Lu Ming had always wanted to use his sword to travel the world. Naturally, he had a special love for swords. Later on, he obtained the lustrous sword technique from the Supreme shrine and joined the mystical sword sect. Therefore, subconsciously, Lu Ming felt that he should be a swordsman.</p><p>However, during this period of time, the lustrous sword technique had been stuck at the fifth level, and it was difficult to break through the sixth level, which was the unity of man and martial arts.</p><p>He had thought that it was just because he was not mature enough. As long as he cultivated diligently, he would definitely be able to break through.</p><p>But now that he thought about it, this was probably not the reason at all. It was because the sword technique was not compatible with him at all.</p><p>If they were not compatible, they would have to spend more time and energy than others to cultivate to the highest realm.</p><p>Some people were born to practice the sword, while others were born to practice the saber or the spear.</p><p>Of course, this was related to one’s personality, cultivation techniques, and even the bloodline one had awakened.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he cultivated the true war Dragon technique and had awakened his bloodline. Now that he was a little like a snake, wouldn’t he be more compatible with the spear?</p><p>Lu Ming picked up Zhu Bing’s long spear and thrust it forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air and let out a sharp whistling sound. Lu Ming felt that the Dragon-shaped vital energy in his body surged out the moment the spear was thrust forward. It burst out along the long spear.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>A ray of spear light burst out like a dragon, piercing the air with a crackling sound.</p><p>my zhenqi is even smoother. It’s done in one go. As expected, I’m more suited to spear training.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have to properly cultivate my spear technique after I return. However, I’ll put it aside for now. I’ll see what’s in the other boxes first.</p><p>He put the spear down and looked at the other boxes.</p><p>There were two large boxes, and they were all filled with jewelry, gold, and silver.</p><p>The other smaller box was filled with gold and silver notes.</p><p>One tael of gold was equivalent to ten taels of silver.</p><p>After a rough estimate, these chests added up to at least two million taels of silver.</p><p>This made Lu Ming ecstatic.</p><p>Two million taels of silver was equivalent to twenty thousand contribution points. How much demonic beast blood essence could it be exchanged for?</p><p>This wasn’t even considered a profound grade martial arts technique, but what about the fire gun technique?</p><p>This trip was not in vain.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming truly understood the dangers of the world.</p><p>The competition was intense not only within the mystical sword sect, but in other places.</p><p>For the sake of survival, for the sake of resources, they would fight and kill without end. Even if you were a disciple of a big sect, if you were a little careless, you would die.</p><p>Just like this time, Zhu Jiaming knew that he was a disciple of the mystical sword sect, but he still dared to attack. If he was not careful enough, he would have become Zhu Bing’s chess piece and died under the poisonous insect.</p><p>Everyone was fighting hard. If you didn’t advance, you would be surpassed by others and become a stepping stone for others.</p><p>Lu Ming was not willing to be someone else’s stepping stone. Therefore, he had to work hard. He wanted others to be his stepping stone.</p><p>After he was done, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and continued his journey to the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>A day later, a majestic mountain range appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The dark blood Mountain was a famous mountain in the eastern part of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>Because the entire dark blood Mountain range was dark red in color.</p><p>The ground was dark red, the rocks were dark red, and even the plants were dark red, as if they had been soaked in blood. That was why it was called dark blood Mountain.</p><p>According to the legends, the dark blood Mountain wasn’t originally like this. After an unknown period of time, there was once a peerless expert who had a great battle with someone. Fresh blood scattered and seeped into the mountains and rivers, and that was how the dark blood Mountain was formed.</p><p>If this was true, it would be extremely shocking.</p><p>What kind of existence was this? That’s why there was so much blood that dyed the mountains red?</p><p>Regardless of whether it was real or fake, there were indeed some very strange treasures in the dark blood Mountain, which attracted many people to come here to seek for treasures.</p><p>The blood Reiki flower and the dark Bloodstone that Lu Ming needed for the mission were among them.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming dashed into the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>It was indeed very strange. The trees that came into view were all dark red, and the stones under his feet were also dark red.</p><p>Lu Ming kept moving forward, his eyes searching everywhere to see if he could find the blood Reiki flower.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a ray of red light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword was unsheathed, and the red light was cut in half.</p><p>It was a dark red Scorpion.</p><p>The Scorpion was poisonous. Lu Ming slowed down and observed his surroundings carefully.</p><p>After a few miles.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>More than ten giant wolves with dark red fur surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the unique dark blood Wolf of the dark blood Mountain. It was 1.5 meters tall and three meters long. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Every one of them was a class 1 Lv 2 demonic beast, and there were even a few Class 2 Lv 2 demonic beasts.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>More than a dozen dark blood Wolves pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
