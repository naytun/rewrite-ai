Her Fifth Level blood meridians were in the form of an Ice Soul Bird.</p><p>Fifth Level blood meridians were considered one of the top meridians amongst the new apprentices.</p><p>“Slay!” Feng Wu cried out as she attacked.</p><p>Lu Ming moved in quickly as he started his assault.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>A symphony of weapons clashing and Essential Qi exploding could be heard as they fought.</p><p>There was only one person from the opposing party fighting Feng Wu. The other three were going against Lu Ming.</p><p>Nevertheless, Lu Ming fought swiftly, and his Essential Qi and swordsmanship were undefeatable.</p><p>Lu Ming cut one of his three opponents into half after a few mere moves.</p><p>Blood was spilled yet again as Lu Ming’s sword stabbed another opponent in the heart.</p><p>The three Master Realm martial artists were as fragile as babies in front of Lu Ming. They did not even stand a chance. Finally, only the Duanmu disciple remained.</p><p>‘How is Lu Ming so strong? Didn’t that old geyser Lu Yunxiong say that he’s only a low-level martial artist?! He lied to us!’ the Duanmu disciple roared in his heart. He could not care less about the Lightning Leopard anymore as he tried to run for his life.</p><p>1</p><p>From behind, Lu Ming pierced his heart with his sword immediately. It was impossible to run away from him.</p><p>Ahh!</p><p>At the same time, a desperate cry was heard on the other side of the battlefield as Feng Wu killed the other White Tiger Hall apprentice.</p><p>A Fifth Level blood meridian carried more destruction than a Third Level blood meridian! Her eyes flickered as she gaped at Lu Ming.</p><p>‘The three martial artists that were on the same level as he was were no match against him at all, and all that happened even before he unleashed his blood meridians. That’s crazy! No wonder Big Sis Mu Lan had such high hopes of him!’ Feng Wu pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the Lightning Leopard.</p><p>“Huhuuuu…,” whimpered the Lightning Leopard. It lay on the ground with severe injuries on its body as it looked at Lu Ming with eyes filled with despair.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart went out for it as he was reminded about the time when Lu Yao and Lu Yunxiong had stripped him of his blood meridians.</p><p>If this Lightning Leopard ended up in the Duanmu Family’s hands, it would not end well.</p><p>“What’re you gonna do with this Lightning Leopard cub, Lu Ming? I think you should carry it out because a Lightning Leopard cub’s really precious out there.” Feng Wu suggested.</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a laugh, “Do you have an empty jade bottle and some healing medicine with you, Senior Feng Wu?”</p><p>“Yep!” Feng Wu nodded as she conjured two jade bottles out of thin air. One of them was empty while the other one contained a healing medicine to aid muscle repair and stop bleeding.</p><p>“Thanks, Senior Feng!” Lu Ming thanked Feng Wu as he approached the Lightning Leopard with the jade bottles in his hands.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Lightning Leopard growled and bared its fangs as Lu Ming went near it.</p><p>“Don’t worry, lil’ fella. I won’t kill you. I won’t take you away. I just need a little bit of your blood, then I’ll help you heal.” Lu Ming smiled as he promptly seized the cub by its neck.</p><p>Since the cub was already hurt and there was blood oozing out of its wounds, Lu Ming filled the empty jade bottle with about half a bottle of its blood, kept it, and poured the Muscle-repairing Bleed-stopping Medicine onto the Lightning Leopard’s wounds.</p><p>The Muscle-repairing Bleed-stopping Medicine was a top-notch medicine. Within seconds, the cub’s wounds stopped bleeding.</p><p>“Go on. Find a place to heal yourself, lil’ fella. Don’t get captured again now,” Lu Ming said as he patted the cub’s head.</p><p>1</p><p>“Huhuuu!” The Lightning Leopard cub whimpered as it stared at Lu Ming with puppy eyes, surprised about why Lu Ming would let it go.</p><p>On the side, Feng Wu was caught by surprise too. “Are you really letting it go, Lu Ming? Lightning Leopard cubs fetch a hefty price out there, you know.”</p><p>“We’re gonna take more point-worthy metal pieces from the Duanmu Family in a while. I sure won’t have the time to babysit it.” Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>Huhuuu..</p><p>The Lightning Leopard cub ran to Lu Ming and rubbed its head against his leg. Then, it ran to Feng Wu’s leg and did the same.</p><p>1</p><p>“What a clever little fella! It’s so cute!” Feng Wu praised as her eyes sparkled.</p><p>Huhuuuu…</p><p>The Lightning Leopard whimpered as it looked deeply at Lu Ming, then it turned and ran out of the canyon at lightning speed.</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled before searching for point-worthy metal pieces on the corpses, conveniently devouring their blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of five First Grade Master Realm martial artists was beneficial to Lu Ming.</p><p>“They are indeed Master Realm geniuses! They have 30 points each.”</p><p>The point-worthy metal pieces made Lu Ming and Feng Wu thrilled. There were a total of 153 points from the five of them combined.</p><p>Feng Wu only took 50 points and gave the rest to Lu Ming since if it was not for him, she would not have won against the five other First Grade Master Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was to be the first, so he unabashedly kept the rest of the 83 points. He now had 124 points now.</p><p>“Give me a moment please, Senior Sister Feng.”</p><p>Lu Ming sat down in Lotus Position and started to cultivate the blood essence he devoured.</p><p>The blood essence of the five First Grade Master Realm martial artists was very condensed, and as it continued to be converted to Essential Qi, Lu Ming’s cultivation rose at an alarming rate.</p><p>A short while later, Lu Ming shuddered.</p><p>“Second Grade Master Realm!” His eyes glinted.</p><p>Yuan Chong, six First Grade Master Realm martial artists, and a few Warrior Realm martial artists’ essence contributed to Lu Ming’s breakthrough in cultivation.</p><p>However, his blood meridians were still on the Third Level.</p><p>“Let’s go, Senior Sister Feng!” Lu Ming got up and said to Feng Wu.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming curiously. His breakthrough was so subtle that she did not even notice it. She was just intrigued about why Lu Ming had sat down to cultivate, then got up after a short time.</p><p>Feng Wu did not pry into his reasons. After all, everyone had their secrets, didn’t they?</p><p>Both of them exited the canyon and continued their journey towards the inner parts of the Midnight Hills. Most of the Duanmu Family’s teams were deeper in the woods.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming and Feng Wu noticed a pattern carved on a tree, so they stopped. It was the carving of a very lifelike Vermillion Bird on the tree bark.</p><p>“What does this mean?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>That was the third time they were seeing a similar carving on the trees in the past hour.</p><p>“This is a sign specific to the Vermillion Bird Hall. Someone’s calling out for the Vermillion Bird Hall apprentices. You see, the bird’s head points in that direction. That’s where the gathering’s at.”</p><p>“Oh, I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming was new to the Vermillion Bird Hall, so he knew nothing about that. He was not like the other geniuses in the bigger cities who had done their research about the Mystical Sword School before enrolling.</p><p>“They normally wouldn’t gather apprentices like this. What could’ve happened? Let’s take a look, shall we?” Feng Wu suggested, slightly confused.</p><p>“Sure!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, he and Feng Wu walked towards the direction that the Vermillion Bird pointed in.</p><p>CREATORS’ THOUGHTS</p><p>Riise</p><p>From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren’t selected will be refunded within 30 days.
