It was still one step away from the third level.</p><p>After all, it was a black grade martial arts technique, and the difficulty of cultivating it was much more difficult than yellow grade martial arts techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had not improved much either. He had not been deliberately killing demonic beasts or devouring their blood essence these days. Therefore, his cultivation had only reached the peak of the early eighth grade master realm. He was still one step away from the middle eighth grade master realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming was practicing his spear techniques in the middle of the Southridge fire field. He waved his long spear like a Dancing Dragon, bringing with it the sound of air explosions. It was as if a hurricane was blowing within a ten-meter radius.</p><p>“Just a little bit more, just a little bit more!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was very close to the third level. However, he was still lacking a little. It was like a layer of paper that he could not break through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was immersed in the fire gun execution, trying his best to find the aura of a breakthrough.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Right at this moment, a dull boom suddenly sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and stopped cultivating.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued, and it was even more intense than before. Even the ground started to shake.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The roars of the demonic beasts were heard. Then, Lu Ming saw that the demonic beasts seemed to have encountered something terrifying and were running for their lives.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The shaking got louder, and the ground shook violently.</p><p>“Not good, could it be a volcanic eruption? let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart suddenly moved. Then, he was greatly shocked. He turned around and ran outside.</p><p>Along the way, he saw at least a few hundred demon beasts running from the depths to the periphery.</p><p>More than ten minutes later, Lu Ming ran to the outer area and stopped to look at the inner area.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering boom was heard and the ground shook violently. Then, Lu Ming saw an unforgettable scene.</p><p>A fiery red pillar of fire shot out from a mountain peak like a fire Dragon, as if it was about to soar into the sky.</p><p>The pillar of fire shot up into the sky and then dispersed like an extremely beautiful firework.</p><p>Thick smoke billowed and pillars of fire shot into the sky, dyeing the horizon red.</p><p>“Is this the power of a volcanic eruption? They were simply too powerful. All of them gathered together and exploded at once. Their might could break the heavens and earth. This kind of might was simply too shocking. Was this the power of nature? Can human strength contend against it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the scene of the volcano erupting in the distance in a daze.</p><p>“Fire? Gather? Burst? Might?”</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be in a daze. His eyes were staring straight at the volcano in front of him as he mumbled to himself.</p><p>Then, he couldn’t help but take a step forward toward the central region.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The volcano seemed to have accumulated too much energy and was constantly erupting. Fiery red lava was constantly spewing out.</p><p>The more Lu Ming walked towards the central region, the clearer he could see. The ‘might’ was also clearer.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>When Lu Ming reached the central area, he could not help but wave his long spear and cultivate the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>“Fire, magma explosion? Exploded?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He remembered the sixth move of the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>The sixth move was called explosion.</p><p>This move was extremely powerful, but he had never succeeded in cultivating it. At this moment, he suddenly understood it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear suddenly stabbed into the ground. At the same time, the true Qi in his body madly gathered at the tip of the spear. It condensed and did not dissipate. When the long spear stabbed into the ground, all the true Qi suddenly burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge crater over two meters wide and one meter deep was created on the ground.</p><p>“What a powerful force! Was this the ‘explosion’? Moreover, the fire gun art has finally advanced to the third level.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a happy smile.</p><p>Just now, not only did he successfully display the ‘explosion’, but his fire gun art also reached the third level.</p><p>however, the amount of true Qi consumed by this move is too terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled helplessly.</p><p>The explosion technique he had just used had directly consumed a third of his true Qi.</p><p>It seemed that he couldn’t use this move too often and could only use it as a trump card.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming started to cultivate the fire gun controlling art. However, he stopped after two minutes.</p><p>“No, it doesn’t feel right. Compared to a volcano, what I’ve comprehended is only its form and not its” soul “or its” power.””</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The volcano was still erupting with a terrifying might. Just by looking at it, one would feel a sense of fear.</p><p>“Right, this kind of ‘might’, I don’t have this kind of might!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind kept on thinking. His eyes were fixed on the erupting volcano in the distance, as if he was stunned.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the volcanic eruption had stopped. However, he still stood there and pondered. In his mind, it was as if a volcano had appeared and was constantly erupting.</p><p>Unknowingly, the long spear in Lu Ming’s hands began to dance according to the moves of the fire gun controlling art.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The Spear’s radiance whistled and the long spear pierced through the air. Lu Ming cultivated tirelessly.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and his eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right, the force of a volcano, the force of fire, is the force of control.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thrust his spear. It was just an ordinary spear and not any of the moves in the fire gun technique. However, there was a mysterious power contained in it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This move stabbed into the ground. The ground suddenly exploded, sending gravel flying, and a large pit appeared.</p><p>This huge pit was not the slightest bit smaller than the one he had created with the ‘explosion’ move.</p><p>“Force! This is the energy of the fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright. He could not suppress the joy in his heart.</p><p>This time, he had gained a lot from watching the volcanic eruption. Not only did he have a breakthrough in the fire gun control technique, but he also comprehended control force.</p><p>Everything in the world had its own power.</p><p>A mountain, with the ‘momentum’ of a mountain, was majestic and vast.</p><p>Water had the ‘momentum’ of water. It could stir up huge waves and could also nurture life.</p><p>The wind also had the ‘momentum’ of the wind, which could destroy everything and change into nothing.</p><p>Fire, of course, had its own ‘momentum’. It was scorching, violent, and destructive.</p><p>……</p><p>Everything in the world had momentum. If a martial artist could comprehend it and use it, he could burst out with incredible power.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming’s casual shot was actually as powerful as the ‘explosion’ move.</p><p>Then what if he added control force when he used the explosion? How powerful would it be?</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely excited. He had never expected that he could actually comprehend the energy of control, the energy of fire.</p><p>“Force” wasn’t something that just anyone could comprehend. Only a small portion of extremely talented geniuses could comprehend it, and the number was astonishingly small.</p><p>It was even rarer to be able to comprehend control force at the master realm. Since the establishment of the mystical sword sect, not many people had been able to do so.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
