I don’t care who Lu Ming hit or whose house he demolished. I don’t care about all these. If I say that Lu Ming is innocent, he is innocent.</p><p>If I say he’s not guilty, he’s not guilty!</p><p>So domineering, so overbearing. This was Mu Lan. She was completely unreasonable when she was domineering.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Instantly, Yao Tianyu’s face turned red and he almost suffered internal injuries.</p><p>Mu Lan didn’t play by the rules at all, yet he couldn’t do anything to her.</p><p>“Elder Mu Lan, even though you’re an elder of the Vermillion Bird Hall and the granddaughter of Dean Yan, you can’t just use your power to bully others, can you? There are so many disciples here watching.”</p><p>After holding it in for a long time, Yao Tianyu finally managed to squeeze out this sentence.</p><p>“I’m just bullying people, so what?”</p><p>Mu Lan replied indifferently.</p><p>Yao Tianyu trembled in anger.</p><p>“Good, good. If that’s the case, I’ll report this to the elders of the Tribunal Council. Let’s go!”</p><p>Mu Lan’s arrival was extremely domineering. Yao Tianyu knew that it was impossible to take down Lu Ming today. After leaving behind a harsh sentence, he turned around and left.</p><p>“Who said you can leave?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s figure paused. He looked at Mu Lan and gritted his teeth.”Elder Mu Lan, what’s your order?”</p><p>“You injured him and want to leave just like that, isn’t that too easy? Leave behind the medical expenses? I think it will take at least one or two million taels of silver to fully recover from this kind of injury.”</p><p>Mu Lan’s gaze wandered all over Lu Ming as she said slowly.</p><p>“Medical expenses? One or two million taels?”</p><p>All around, the onlookers were stunned. Some of them dug their ears hard, thinking that they had heard wrong.</p><p>Even Lu Ming was in a daze.</p><p>Mu Lan was asking for an exorbitant price.</p><p>As expected, Yao Tianyu couldn’t hold it in any longer and roared, ” “Medical expenses? Mu Lan, don’t go too far. Lu Ming injured so many of our people? I didn’t even ask him for medical fees, and you’re asking me for it? impossible, I’m telling you, it’s impossible!”</p><p>“Injured your people? They deserve it. Let me tell you, if you don’t pay for the medical expenses today, I don’t mind breaking your bones one by one.”</p><p>Mu Lan said coldly.</p><p>He was too domineering and overbearing. He did not give Yao Tianyu any face at all. No, it was not that he did not give Yao Tianyu any face, but he did not put him in his eyes at all.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Although he was a genius on the bronze rank, he was only a bronze disciple. If he were to fight Mu Lan, he would definitely be killed with a single slap.</p><p>His face turned green and white. If he were to give in today and pay for the medical expenses, he would really lose all his face.</p><p>“Haha, niece Mu Lan, in my opinion, let’s just drop this matter.”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice was heard. A figure descended from the sky.</p><p>It was an old man in his 60S. He was wearing a silver robe and had a kind smile on his face.</p><p>He was a silver-robed elder.</p><p>Upon seeing the old man, Yao Tianyu was overjoyed and shouted, ” “Elder Ming, you must seek justice for this disciple. Elder Mu Lan has gone too far.”</p><p>This silver-robed elder was from the Azure Dragon Hall.</p><p>Mu Lan’s expression darkened as well. She said,”Old man Ming, I advise you not to meddle in other people’s business,”</p><p>The people in the surroundings were dumbfounded again. Mu Lan was too awesome, wasn’t she? she called a silver-robed elder an old man?</p><p>However, elder Ming did not show any signs of anger. He still smiled and said,”I have already heard about the entire incident. I think that there is a huge misunderstanding. According to my speculation, the star Moon Tower is the one who is in the wrong.”</p><p>“The star Moon Tower forcefully bought their disciples ‘materials. Lu Ming fought for justice and injured their disciples. As members of the enforcement Hall, Yao Tianyu and the rest naturally had to question Lu Ming when they saw him injuring someone. This caused a fight. This is a complete misunderstanding. Since both parties have people injured, I think we should just let this matter go.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Elder Ming was sacrificing the war chariot to protect the general. This elder Ming looked kind, but in fact, he was a cunning old fox. He pushed all the blame to the star Moon Tower with just one sentence.</p><p>In this way, Yao Tianyu would not have to pay for the medical expenses, and Yao Tianyu and the others would have nothing to say to the elder of the Tribunal Council.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s face darkened, but he did not say anything.</p><p>If this matter was really investigated, it would be impossible to hide the fact that the star Moon Tower had forcefully bought the materials for the Vermillion Bird Hall’s new disciples. Therefore, it would be good if they could push the blame on the star Moon Tower.</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes flickered.</p><p>This elder Ming was a silver-robed elder. If he was bent on protecting Yao Tianyu, she would be helpless.</p><p>“Oh? Since it’s the star Moon Tower’s fault, they must be severely punished. Otherwise, the disciples of the four courtyards will not be convinced.”</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes flickered before she smiled.</p><p>of course. The star Moon Tower will definitely punish them severely. All the materials will also be returned.</p><p>Elder Ming smiled, then said to Yao Tianyu, ” “Tianyu, why haven’t you brought the disciples of the Tribunal Council back to recuperate yet?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu cupped his fists and ordered the uninjured disciples to help the injured disciples back to their rooms.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Then, Yao Tianyu cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, turned around, and left.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly called out.</p><p>Yao Tianyu stopped in his tracks. He turned around and glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed as he stared at Yao Tianyu.”Yao Tianyu, what kind of skill do you have to call these minions to attack me? I’m challenging you right now. Do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place fell into silence.</p><p>Lu Ming actually challenged Yao Tianyu? How was that possible? How could he be a match for Yao Tianyu?</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Yao Tianyu retorted.</p><p>“Not bad!” yes! Lu Ming replied firmly.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s lips curled into a mocking smile as he said disdainfully, ” “Lu Ming, I’m a disciple on the bronze ranking. What right do you have to challenge me?”</p><p>you can challenge me after you’ve made it to the bronze rank. You’re not qualified to do so now.</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s eyes were filled with arrogance and disdain.</p><p>With that, he turned around and left.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Are you disdainful to accept my challenge?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t think too much about it. This is the rule of the mystical sword sect. If you want to challenge a disciple on the bronze list, you must be on the bronze list as well. Only then will you be qualified. Otherwise, you don’t have the right to challenge them.</p><p>Seeing this, Mu Lan started explaining to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>However, Yao Tianyu’s condescending and disdainful look just now could not be removed from Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“The bronze ranking? I’ll get there soon. Yao Tianyu, just you wait.”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly, his eyes filled with determination.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, how are you?”</p><p>Only then did Feng Wu and Hua Chi arrive, panting.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
