It was the Flaming Steps, consisting of nine steps.</p><p>...</p><p>It was produced by a master craftsman whom the Lu Family spent a fortune to hire. It was a peculiar device, with intricate inscriptions etched onto the surface.</p><p>The inscriptions on the steps would activate when someone stepped on it. It would begin to emit scorching heat that would surround the challenger who attempted to ascend the stairs.</p><p>Similar to being enveloped in a blazing fire, the person would have to bear the pain and torture of being enveloped in flames.</p><p>Although the flames were not real, the sensation was no different from being within an actual fire.</p><p>Furthermore, the scorching heat grew stronger with each step.</p><p>For this test, it was a competition between who could stay on top for the longest time, and who could climb to the highest step.</p><p>Naturally, the longer and higher the step one could stay on indicated stronger willpower.</p><p>“Allow me to go first.”</p><p>A junior of the Lu Family around the age of sixteen walked towards the Flaming Steps. Upon his first step onto the stairs, a large ray light instantly erupted from it, emitting a fiery red radiance.</p><p>The expression on the youth’s face changed drastically. He seemed to be in pain, but he immediately grit his teeth and took another step to the second level, which was closely followed by yet another step to the third level.</p><p>At that point, he stopped and started to struggle against the pain of being enveloped in flames.</p><p>However, his body started to shake in only ten breaths. His face was ghastly pale and contorted. It was obvious that he was bearing an intense amount of torture.</p><p>Yet another ten breaths passed. No longer able to withstand the heat, he yelped and jumped off the Flaming Steps.</p><p>“Lu Li, third step, twenty breaths.”</p><p>Lu Yunfeng announced.</p><p>Then, the juniors of the Lu Family stepped up one by one to take the test.</p><p>However, most of them lingered around the third and fourth steps and only lasted around twenty to thirty breaths.</p><p>“Allow me to try!”</p><p>Lu Chuan walked up. He glanced at Lu Ming and sneered before he ascended the steps.</p><p>His pace was rapid as he reached the fifth step without any signs of stopping.</p><p>Then, he stopped on the fifth step and stood there for as long as fifty-two breaths.</p><p>This shocked the crowd.</p><p>“Mm, as expected from Lu Yao’s elder brother. While the sister has paralleled talent, the brother doesn’t pale in comparison either. To actually be able to stay in the fifth step for fifty-two breaths!” Duanmu Qing praised.</p><p>“Haha, Envoy Duanmu likes to overpraise,” the First Branch Elder bellowed.</p><p>Lu Chuan smiled smugly.</p><p>Then, the test continued. There were quite a few people who possessed a strong will, two which did not pale in comparison to Lu Chuan. One stayed on the fifth step for fifty-two breaths, while another survived for fifty-five breaths.</p><p>However, nobody dared to challenge the sixth step.</p><p>Soon, only Lu Yao and Lu Ming were left on the platform.</p><p>Lu Yao glanced at Lu Ming and approached the Flaming Steps.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s gaze was focused on Lu Yao.</p><p>There was a huge amount of expectation placed upon Lu Yao. Everyone wanted to see how strong her willpower was.</p><p>Those with amazing talents may not have a strong will.</p><p>Lu Yao delicately stepped onto the first step, and quickly ascended to the second step.</p><p>Step by step, she ascended to the sixth step in one go, without any signs of stopping.</p><p>Reaching the sixth step meant that she had already surpassed everyone else. Everyone held their breaths and focused on her.</p><p>However, Lu Yao did not stop. She took another step and ascended to the seventh level.</p><p>“Lu Yao actually ascended to the seventh step. Truly impressive!”</p><p>“Let’s see how long she can last.”</p><p>The crowd started to make predictions.</p><p>However, the answer came to them very soon.</p><p>Eighty-six breaths.</p><p>Lu Yao lingered on the seventh step for eighty-six breaths before she hopped off the stairs.</p><p>“Impressive, truly impressive! Not only is Lu Yao gifted with extraordinary talents, but she also has a strong will! She is truly a girl gifted by the gods!”</p><p>“Indeed! That was the seventh step, which is incomparable to the steps below!”</p><p>People in the crowd were discussing intensely.</p><p>Lu Yao was expressionless as she turned and walked away, as if what she had just achieved was insignificant. When she passed by Lu Ming, there was a look of disdain in her eyes.</p><p>“Did you see that? That’s the difference between us.” Her soft voice echoed in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“Is that so? You’d best remember those words.” Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer as he walked towards the Flaming Steps.</p><p>“He’s over his own head!” The First Branch Elder sneered on the main grandstand.</p><p>“How many steps do you think that Lu Ming will be able to ascend?” Lu Chuan asked the other young people with a smile on the platform.</p><p>“From how I see it, it’ll be the second step at most.”</p><p>“Less than ten breaths on the second step, in my opinion.”</p><p>A few other youths laughed.</p><p>As the words left their mouths, their smiles were frozen in place as their eyes involuntarily widened.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming had already ascended the second step. He walked up to the third step but seemed to have no intention to stop as he ascended yet another step to the fourth step.</p><p>The fifth step followed, and the sixth step next…</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop after he reached the seventh step. He lifted his legs and ended up on the eighth step.</p><p>However, that was not Lu Ming’s destination! At that moment, he lifted his foot and took another step.</p><p>In the crowd, everyone’s hearts rose in tandem with Lu Ming’s foot. Then, it fell in sync with Lu Ming’s foot as he reached the ninth level.</p><p>What followed was a thunderous uproar.</p><p>“Goodness! Lu Ming ascended to the ninth step! How could this be possible?!”</p><p>“So what if he could get there? The point is to see how long he can endure! It would be even more embarrassing if he couldn’t handle it and left in a single breath!”</p><p>“Such overconfidence. It shall be a sight to behold when he turns into an oaf because his mind collapsed from being unable to bear the torture,” the First Branch Elder said coolly.</p><p>“Ming’er!”</p><p>“Young Master!”</p><p>Li Ping and Qiu Yue’s hands were locked in sweat below the platform. Their eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>However, the din from the crowd slowly lessened.</p><p>It was because ten breaths had already passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually lingered on the ninth step for ten breaths without coming down.</p><p>Obviously, the ten breaths were just the beginning.</p><p>Time was slowly ticking. Twenty breaths, thirty breaths…</p><p>A hundred breaths had quickly passed, but Lu Ming still remained on top.</p><p>His slender figure stood tall on the ninth step, like a sharp blade.</p><p>The crowd was dead silent.</p><p>“I bet his mind had already collapsed. Could he have died standing?”</p><p>The First Branch Elder sneered.</p><p>However, at that moment, Lu Ming smiled. “Lu Yao, what you said was correct, this is the difference between you and I.” His voice echoed from afar.</p><p>Not only were his words like a slap across the First Branch Elder’s cheek, but it was also a slap on Lu Yao’s cheek as well.</p><p>Those words were from Lu Yao to Lu Ming. At that point, Lu Ming had reflected it straight back at her with the hard truth.</p><p>Lu Yao’s beautiful eyes were flickering as she gazed at Lu Yao, who was atop the Flaming Steps. However, she quickly calmed herself. “Lu Ming, you’ve been a piece of trash for your entire life, suffering humiliation from others, that’s quite a strong will that you’ve achieved. However, it is merely a base; what matters most is the talent. I will show you next, the true difference between you and me!”</p><p>The crowd suddenly saw the light after her speech.</p><p>After thinking about it, it was natural that Lu Ming, a piece of trash, would have a stable mind after suffering through endless humiliation after all these years.</p><p>“So that’s how it is!” Duanmu Qing smiled.</p><p>“Is that so?” A vague smile formed on Mu Lan’s face. She was looking forward to Duanmu Qing and the First Branch Elder’s reactions after they witnessed Lu Ming’s performance later on.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were calm as he smiled feebly on the steps. As if he was taking a stroll through a park, he slowly walked down the steps.</p><p>“Alright, the first round has ended. On to the second round, meridian testing. Prepare the meridian testing altar!” The Second Branch Elder announced.</p><p>Around ten muscular men then hoisted an altar that was around a hundred and fifty centimeters high onto the platform. There were dense inscriptions etched onto the altar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
