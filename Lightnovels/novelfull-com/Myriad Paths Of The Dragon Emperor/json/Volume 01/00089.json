He was dead for sure.</p><p>The power of the black grade low level martial arts technique was finally on display. Lu Ming had only cultivated it to the second level, but its power was double that of the yellow grade high level martial arts technique’s sixth level.</p><p>“What … How could he be so strong? You … Who are they?”</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions Sword School asked unwillingly as he coughed up blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with disbelief. With his cultivation at the peak of the eighth grade master realm, he was actually defeated in one move.</p><p>The cultivation that Lu Ming revealed was clearly only at the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the mystical sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“The mystical sword sect?”</p><p>The young man murmured. His eyes then became unfocused and his vitality completely disappeared.</p><p>At the same time, the other two eighth grade master realm experts had also died.</p><p>Their internal organs were also crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although the spear technique was not as varied as the sword technique, it was more violent, more direct, and more overbearing.</p><p>The chubby young man was the only one left.</p><p>At this moment, the chubby young man’s face was deathly pale. His body was constantly trembling, and cold sweat was flowing down his face.</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the fat young man step by step.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The chubby young man shouted in shock.</p><p>tell me, what does the ten direction sword sect want by capturing so many ordinary stone hunters? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“I can say it, but you have to promise not to kill me,”</p><p>The chubby young man rolled his eyes and shouted.</p><p>“Oh? You don’t want to say it? Then you can go to hell.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he raised the long spear in his hand.</p><p>The chubby young man was so scared that his soul almost scattered. He shouted, ” “I’ll talk, I’ll talk, I’ll talk!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at him coldly, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>we came with senior brother Zheng. He said he would bring us here to search for treasures, so we came.</p><p>senior brother Zheng said that he had read about an extinct volcano near the inner area of the Southridge fire field in the ancient books recorded by his ancestors. There are treasures inside.</p><p>The chubby young man hurriedly explained.</p><p>then why did you catch so many ordinary stone hunters? ” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>because the area around the extinct volcano is very unstable. Lava and flames will burst out from time to time. The ground will even sink in. We need someone to find a safe way to enter the extinct volcano.</p><p>The chubby young man was scared to death and spoke in full detail.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It was obvious that they wanted to use the stone hunters ‘lives to find a way for them.</p><p>This was what martial arts powerhouses were like. In their eyes, the lives of ordinary people were like ants.</p><p>Lu Ming would never show mercy to his enemies. However, he could not disregard the lives of others for his own selfish reasons.</p><p>“What treasures are there in that extinct volcano?” Lu Ming pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p>I don’t know about that. Senior brother Zheng didn’t tell us. I’ve told you everything I know. Can you let me go now? ”</p><p>The chubby young man begged, but he was thinking about how to ask senior brother Zheng to kill Lu Ming after he escaped.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I have another question. What’s your senior brother Zheng’s cultivation? Is there anyone who is stronger than him?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>The chubby young man answered honestly, ” senior brother Zheng is a famous genius of our ten directions Sword School. He has already won eight consecutive victories on the bronze platform. He’s not much weaker than the geniuses on the bronze ranking. Among the senior and junior brothers who came this time, senior brother Zheng is the strongest.</p><p>“Eight consecutive wins on the bronze list?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The division of ranks among the disciples of the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire was similar. They were all divided into three ranks: Bronze, Silver, and gold.</p><p>Similarly, there were bronze and silver lists in every sect.</p><p>The rules were exactly the same.</p><p>“Alright, I’ve said what you wanted me to say. Can you let me go now?”</p><p>The chubby young man said.</p><p>“Let you go? When did I say I would let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he thrust the long spear and pierced the fat young man’s heart.</p><p>“Eight consecutive wins on the bronze platform? I wonder how powerful the eight consecutive wins on the bronze platform of the ten direction sword sect are?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Back then, he had vomited blood from he tie’s punch. He tie had won eight consecutive victories on the bronze platform of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>They both had eight consecutive wins on the bronze platform, but they belonged to two different sects. Their abilities might not be the same, but the difference would not be too great. Lu Ming’s combat strength had improved greatly during this period of time. It was a good time to test the results.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming devoured all the blood essence of the omnidirectional sword sect disciples and found a place to refine them.</p><p>As for the stone hunters, they had already fled like a swarm of bees when the Shifang sword sect disciples were killed.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s essential Qi had fully recovered and he had reached his peak.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming ran in the direction of the extinct volcano that the chubby young man had mentioned.</p><p>……</p><p>In the southern ridge fire field, in the depths of the central area, near the inner area, there was a tall, dead volcano.</p><p>It was unknown when this volcano had stopped erupting, but the temperature around it was still astonishingly high.</p><p>The ground was red.</p><p>A few thousand meters away from the extinct volcano, there were more than twenty young men. Needless to say, they were all disciples of the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>More than 20 disciples of the ten directions Sword School surrounded more than 30 stone hunters.</p><p>More than 30 stone hunters gathered together, their faces terrified and trembling.</p><p>young heroes of the ten directions Sword School, I beg you. It’s really dangerous there. If you let us explore the way, we’ll be sending ourselves to our deaths. I have old and young people to take care of. I beg you, please let me go back.</p><p>A burly man in his fifties kept bowing and begging.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of sword light, the burly man’s head flew high into the air.</p><p>“So noisy. You want to leave? I’ll send you on your way now.”</p><p>A disciple from the ten directions Sword School sheathed his sword and said coldly.</p><p>The other stone hunters suddenly kept quiet out of fear and did not dare to speak again. However, the look of despair on their faces became even more intense.</p><p>you, hurry up and Scout the way. If you’re lucky enough to walk past, you can still keep your dog life.</p><p>A disciple from the ten directions sword sect pointed at a dark-skinned man.</p><p>The burly man’s eyes were filled with despair, and his body trembled.</p><p>“If you don’t want to go, then die now!”</p><p>The disciple from the ten directions Sword School said coldly.</p><p>“I’ll go, I’ll go!”</p><p>The burly man said in a trembling voice.</p><p>Then, he walked out while trembling.</p><p>If they went out to explore, they might still have a way out. If they didn’t go, they would die.</p><p>This burly man must have cultivated martial arts, but he had not awakened his bloodline. He was only at the first grade warrior realm.</p><p>He walked forward carefully, and soon, he had walked more than 200 meters.</p><p>Hu, suddenly, a stream of lava rushed out from the ground and directly submerged the burly man.</p><p>arghh! the burly man screamed and turned into a ball of fire. In a few breaths, he was turned into a pile of charcoal.</p><p>The temperature of the lava was terrifyingly high.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
