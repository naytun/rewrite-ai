No one expected Lu Ming, the one Lu Family openly labeled ‘useless trash’, to defeat the shiny star, Lu Yao, as if it was a piece of cake.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>...</p><p>First Branch Elder bellowed in utter disbelief. He could not take it.</p><p>He expected Lu Yao to simply just gain victory and take over the Lu Family. Never would he have dreamt that the useless trash they robbed two months ago would have such strong capabilities to defeat Lu Yao effortlessly.</p><p>“How did that happen?” Duanmu Qing too found it hard to believe.</p><p>“Duanmu Qing, as long as you’re a genius, nothing is impossible. This Lu Ming had three divine meridians unlocked at such a young age, defeated Lu Yao, a Fourth Grade Novice Realm plus exploded blood meridians, with just a Third Grade Novice Realm cultivation. He’s most definitely a rare genius,” Gao Shi commented.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming outdid Lu Yao in the test of willpower, meridians, and the duel. Since Lu Yao’s betrothed to the White Tiger Hall, I won’t fight with you for her. The Azure Dragon Hall will take in Lu Ming.” Tie Zhong added with gleaming eyes.</p><p>“What are you talking about, Tie Zhong? What do you mean by Azure Dragon Hall taking in Lu Ming? Lu Ming is coming with me to Onyx Tortoise Hall.”</p><p>Gao Shi glowered at Tie Zhong, turned to Lu Ming, and offered, “Lu Ming, we at Onyx Tortoise Hall sincerely welcome you with open arms. I promise, if you join us, we’ll offer you two Land Level martial arts techniques of your choice, and our upper management will personally take you in and train you as an apprentice.”</p><p>“Lu Ming, we at Azure Dragon Hall welcome you too. If you join us, you’d not only just have access to our Land Level martial arts techniques, you can also cultivate at our top-secret cultivation spots.”</p><p>Tie Zhong dropped a bombshell.</p><p>The words of these two Hall messengers spread across the field, which caused an uproar yet again.</p><p>It was obvious that these two Hall’s messengers valued Lu Ming.</p><p>Even though it was said that Lu Ming could not awaken his blood meridian in the Lu Family, it did not mean that he could not awaken it in Mystical Sword Sect.</p><p>Mystical Sword Sect had been around for ages with numerous classified techniques, which included classified techniques to once again awaken one’s meridians.</p><p>Lu Ming possessed such talents even before his blood meridians were awakened. How crazily talented would he be once he awakened his blood meridians?</p><p>Besides that, even though blood meridians were important to a martial artist. it was not the only important thing.</p><p>There were blood meridian martial artists who made history for their remarkable achievements in the path of martial arts without awakened blood meridians.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming genuinely failed to awaken his blood meridians, his future achievements would not be too bad too.</p><p>Desire burned in the hearts of the messengers from Azure Dragon Hall and Onyx Tortoise Hall.</p><p>Frustration flashed in Duanmu Qing’s eyes. It was unfortunate that the White Tiger Hall had no chance with Lu Ming at all since they were undoubtedly on Lu Yao’s side.</p><p>Instead of replying to the two Hall messengers, Lu Ming looked at Lu Yao indifferently and said, “Lu Yao, I used to think that you and Lu Yunxiong were family, I trusted you. Little did I know, I’m nothing but a valuable piece of junk to you.”</p><p>“Not only that, but you also wanted to be Lord of the Lu Family. You told me two months ago that everything hinged on capabilities in this world. You only get a say if you’re strong, and the weak will always be trampled on. Now, I shall give these words back to you.”</p><p>“You’re a loser to me. You’re not worthy enough to be my opponent.” Lu Ming’s clear voice rang across the place.</p><p>Every word Lu Ming said was like a resounding slap to Lu Yao’s face.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, don’t be cocky. Did you really think you could be somebody? I have the Duanmu Family backing me up, what do you have against me? I may have lost temporarily, but in a year, no, within half a year, I’ll overtake you in every way and completely trample you under my feet.”</p><p>Lu Yao yelled hysterically, her face distorted with rage.</p><p>Defeated, overtook, and looked down by someone she deemed as a useless piece of trash nearly sent her over the edge.</p><p>“Lu Ming, keep your sword away and get the f*ck off the battle stage!” First Branch Elder yelled.</p><p>“Shut up, b*tch, and you, Lu Yunxiong. Who gave you the right to speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming snarled at them with an overwhelming intent to kill. With a flick of his sword, he drew a bloody fine line on Lu Yao’s neck. Lu Yao’s face paled immediately.</p><p>“How dare you hurt her, Lu Yao is engaged to Duanmu Lin, the genius of White Tiger Hall. Do you have a death wish?” Duanmu Qing yelled.</p><p>Lu Ming did not spare him a glance and instead turned to the seven core elders.</p><p>“Fellow elders, do you wanna know why I can’t awaken my blood meridian?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Why can’t he awake his blood meridian?”</p><p>Many gawked. If one had failed to awaken their blood meridians, what else could it be? Was it not a personal problem? Was there something they did not know about?</p><p>“Speak, Lu Ming. Is there anything we should know?”</p><p>The oldest of the seven core elders spoke.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t talk nonsense!” First Branch Elder exclaimed before Lu Ming said anything.</p><p>“Shut up, Lu Yunxiong,” the oldest of the core elders ordered.</p><p>First Branch Elder stopped talking with a grimace.</p><p>“That’s because this ‘shining star’ and this First Branch Elder over here pretended to be nice to me, and fed me Yama Pollen for three years. He fed my blood meridians with my own blood for three years, that’s why I failed to awaken my blood meridians. Then, they robbed me of my blood meridians and combined it with Lu Yao’s.”</p><p>“Why did you think you could awaken a Fifth Level blood meridian, Lu Yao? What enabled you to do so?” Lu Ming recounted calmly.</p><p>Whatever Lu Ming said caused a huge uproar and everyone was shocked beyond words.</p><p>Many knew that Lu Ming went through a meridians test and was said to have inherited his father’s blood meridians, and it could be awakened.</p><p>It somehow failed to be awakened later on and something was not quite right about it.</p><p>The truth was out, and it had cleared up a lot of things.</p><p>“B*stards, filthy animals, how could you do this to Ming’er!”</p><p>Li Ping was the first to react. She shrieked as she stared deadly at First Branch Elder and Lu Yao with her bloodshot eyes, her body trembled in fury.</p><p>Tears flowed freely from Li Ping’s eyes.</p><p>She had no clue that the injuries on Lu Ming two months ago were a result of his blood meridians being stripped off him. How agonizing it must have been for Lu Ming to have his blood meridians forcefully taken from him.</p><p>“Is this for real?”</p><p>Storms were brewing in the eyes of all seven core elders and their faces darkened.</p><p>“Lu Ming you liar, you’re a piece of useless junk, don’t blame us you imbecile, shameless fool! Fellow elders, Lu Ming’s hopeless, his character is unsalvageable, I suggest having him kicked out of the Lu Family.” First Branch Elder bellowed, his eyes flickered maliciously.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming, do you think anyone would believe in your lies?” Lu Yao added coldly.</p><p>“Haha, a test would immediately reveal if what I said about feeding blood meridians with my blood for three years is true. Lu Yao, do you have the guts to be tested?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared intently at Lu Yao.</p><p>Lu Yao’s face paled, and the First Branch Elder’s face looked venomous.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
