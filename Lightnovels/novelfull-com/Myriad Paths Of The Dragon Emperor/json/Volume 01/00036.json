The first-place winner would be rewarded with a Spirit Condensing Fruit.</p><p>He would fight for it with all his might even if he was currently far behind in terms of points.</p><p>Lu Ming put his Dragon Serpent Steps to full use and zipped through the woods. He went straight for demonic beasts with point-worthy metal pieces on them, skipping all the ordinary demonic beasts.</p><p>By nightfall, he had gotten another one-point metal piece and a two-point metal piece which brought him to a total of 28 points.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming heard fighting sounds near where he was.</p><p>‘Someone’s there.’</p><p>Lu Ming could vaguely see firelight flickering up ahead through the canopy of trees from where the sound came from.</p><p>‘Let’s take a look!’ He moved towards the bonfire up ahead and saw four people by the bonfire: Feng Wu, Yuan Chong, Zhou Hao, and Zhou Xu.</p><p>However, things were not as he would have expected.</p><p>Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu lay limply on the ground, their faces a sickly pale color.</p><p>Feng Wu had her sword drawn, but her body was shaking. Her face held the same shade of white while her eyes filled with rage as she glowered at Yuan Chong. “Yuan Chong, why did you poison the meat?” she snarled.</p><p>With his sword drawn and a warped expression, Yuan Chong snickered, “Why?! Feng Wu, you b*tch, I’ve pursued you endlessly for the past two years. Why didn’t you accept me?! You even yelled at me because of that b*stard Lu Ming before this. I’ve had enough!</p><p>“You’ve now been poisoned by my Unscented Tissue-paralyzing Drug. Let’s see how you’ll fight it! I’ll make you my woman today, haha!”</p><p>Feng Wu’s face was distorted with rage as she yelled, “How dare you, Yuan Chong!? Big Sis Mu Lan will make you pay for this when the test is over!”</p><p>“Mu Lan? Heh heh. That b*tch will become the Duanmu Family’s play toy sooner or later. Also, did you think you were gonna leave this place alive?!” Yuan Chong jeered.</p><p>“Are you gonna kill us?!” Feng Wu sputtered. She could barely stand upright as she struggled to maintain her balance.</p><p>“Heh heh, Feng Wu, I’ll take care of you personally after I ‘take care’ of you, so you’ll only belong to me,” Yuan Chong taunted.</p><p>“You…pervert!” Feng Wu’s face was as pale as death. With a shiver, she collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>“Senior Brother Yuan, don’t kill me! Have your way. Take your time with Feng Wu. I promise not to breathe a word of whatever happened today!” Zhou Hao cried.</p><p>“Me too, Senior Brother Yuan! I swear I’ll die a painful death if I say anything at all!” Zhou Xu added.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I believe that dead people are the best secret keepers.” Yuan Chong walked towards Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu with a sinister smile on his face.</p><p>“No, nooooo, have mercy on me!” the two of them cried out in extreme terror.</p><p>Slash! Slash!</p><p>Yuan Chong’s sword gleamed as it slit open Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu’s throats.</p><p>“Now, it’s just you and I.” He then turned and sauntered towards Feng Wu.</p><p>“You-No!” Feng Wu’s face was deathly pale as she fearfully tried to scuttle backward. Unfortunately, she could barely move a limb after being poisoned by the Unscented Tissue-paralyzing Drug.</p><p>Glee filled Yuan Chong’s heart upon the sight of a paralyzed Feng Wu. He walked to her side and grabbed her by the arm.</p><p>Riiiiip! Debris of cloth flew everywhere.</p><p>“Die a horrific death, you filthy animal!” Feng Wu cried out in despair. At that moment, she gave up all hope. She treated Yuan Chong like a friend, so she certainly did not expect him to be such a monster.</p><p>She was supposed to enjoy life, especially her youth, but she was going to die here. In addition to that, she would be defiled before she died. Feng Wu wanted to end it there and then.</p><p>“This place is so secluded. Did you think that someone would rescue you?” Yuan Chong mocked Feng Wu as he leaped towards her.</p><p>Just then, a voice rang out, “Excuse me, my apologies.”</p><p>Alarmed, Yuan Chong turned upon hearing that voice. Feng Wu was ecstatic as hope glimmered in her eyes. Both looked pointedly to where the voice came from.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Yuan Chong and Feng Wu exclaimed at the same time.</p><p>With his arms folded, Lu Ming strode towards them with a faint smile on his face and said to Yuan Chong, “What? Disappointed to see me alive?”</p><p>“I’m a little disappointed indeed. You survived the Duanmu Family and Wei Ziyou. Too bad you’re a foolish one.”</p><p>“Since you ran away, you should’ve found yourself a corner and hid like a dog till the test is over. Instead, you’re right here. Why? Are you gonna play hero and save the damsel in distress, you piece of trash? Hahaha!” Yuan Chong chuckled scornfully as killing intent flashed through his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you here? Hurry, go now. You’re no match for Yuan Chong.” Feng Wu had hope when she saw that someone found them, but that hope turned to despair when she realized that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior Sister Feng Wu, I’m distinctly firm with my gratitude and grudges. I’ll repay them accordingly. You’ve helped me with Wei Ziyou once, so I’ll repay the kindness now by saving your life.” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>1</p><p>“Save her? Lu Ming, you piece of trash, how’re you gonna save her?” Yuan Chong laughed.</p><p>“With my fist, of course!” Lu Ming’s face hardened as he swung his fist towards Yuan Chong.</p><p>“Do you wanna die?” Yuan Chong thrust his palm and attacked Lu Ming. He was going to increase Feng Wu’s despair by destroying Lu Ming’s cultivation. Only that would elevate his joy.</p><p>Unfortunately, ideals were not reality. When his palm collided with Lu Ming’s fist, he felt a gush of immense Essential Qi from the latter that dissolved his Essential Qi immediately.</p><p>A bone-breaking pain erupted in his arm. Yuan Chong yelped as he was forced backward. “Master Realm?! Impossible! How are you already in Master Realm, Lu Ming?” he cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“Master Realm?” Feng Wu’s eyes shone with hope upon witnessing what had happened.</p><p>“Yuan Chong, I told you I’d defeat you in two months. Well, it looks like I only needed half a month.” Lu Ming smirked coldly.</p><p>“Want to defeat me? Don’t even think about it! Go to hell!” Yuan Chong bellowed furiously as immense intent to kill gleamed in his eyes. He took his sword up and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and Feng Wu had to die. If not, when the test was over, his journey in the Mystical Sword Sect would end too.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
