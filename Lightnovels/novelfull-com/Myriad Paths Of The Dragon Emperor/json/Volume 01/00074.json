It’s just two groups of bandits. I can kill them with a flip of my hand. You don’t have to worry. Send someone to lead the way. There’s no need to say anything.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, looking very confident.</p><p>“This … Alright then, but we’ll go together.”</p><p>One of the core elders said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He knew that the few core elders were worried about his safety and he did not reject them.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you must be careful.”</p><p>Li Ping said worriedly.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>Lu Ming gave Li Ping a confident smile.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s confident smile, Li Ping’s worry was slightly alleviated.</p><p>Not long after, the Lu family gathered some people and headed towards the refined iron mine in the South of the mountain range of beasts under the lead of a few core elders.</p><p>That refined iron mine was the main source of income for the Lu clan. Of course, they also had a large number of troops.</p><p>In the past, the Psammophis Pirates would not have dared to attack this refined iron mine alone.</p><p>But it was different now, there were the skeleton bandits.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sound of horses ‘hooves rang out. The Lu clan had mobilized hundreds of people, causing dust to fill the air.</p><p>In front of them, a huge mountain appeared.</p><p>In front of the mountain, there were 300 to 400 people, surrounding the entrance.</p><p>Two flags were raised high, one with a snake and the other with a skeleton.</p><p>“Hahaha, the Lu clan has indeed sent reinforcements.”</p><p>A burst of laughter came from the bandits.</p><p>A strong man riding a tall green scale horse blocked in front of them.</p><p>Psammophis Pirates, skeleton Pirates, and clowns. How dare they attack our Lu family? they’re really looking for death.</p><p>Lu Ming rode on the dark blood Wolf and led the way, shouting coldly.</p><p>young master, don’t be careless. This man is the second leader of the dry bone bandits. His cultivation has already reached the fourth grade master realm.</p><p>One of the core elders hurriedly reminded.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The burly man was slightly taken aback when he saw Lu Ming. Then, he turned to look at the dark blood Wolf under Lu Ming’s command. His eyes narrowed slightly, and a scorching flame flickered.</p><p>haha, it seems like there’s really no one left in the Lu family. After beating up the old one, a brat still wet behind his ears has come. Are they taking turns to court death? ”</p><p>The second-in-command of the dry bone bandits laughed contemptuously and continued, your Mount is not bad. Hurry up and give it to me. I can give you a quick death.</p><p>“Give me a quick death?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He controlled the dark blood Wolf and walked forward step by step.”How ignorant!”</p><p>“I’m ignorant? Don’t think that you can scare me with a decent demonic beast as a Mount. Just watch how I kill you. Ha!”</p><p>The second-in-command of the dry bone bandits bellowed as he maneuvered the green scale horse and charged at Lu Ming like a gust of wind. The saber in his hand was like a violent gust of wind, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on the dark blood Wolf, not moving at all, as if he was frightened.</p><p>“Young master, be careful!”</p><p>The five core elders were shocked and shouted.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>The second-in-command of the dry bone bandits sneered, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>But the next moment, the smile on his face disappeared, because he saw a flash of sword light, which seemed to be faster than lightning, slashing toward him.</p><p>He didn’t even have time to Dodge, let alone Dodge, he didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>Then, he felt a cold sensation on his neck. In the next moment, he saw a headless corpse galloping forward on a green scaled horse.</p><p>Then, he fell into endless darkness.</p><p>“One … A sword strike?”</p><p>Behind him, the five core elders and the rest of the Lu family were all stunned.</p><p>The second-in-command of the dry bone bandits, a fourth grade master realm expert, was an unattainable existence in their eyes. However, Lu Ming had killed him with a single sword strike.</p><p>It had only been a few months, and the young master’s cultivation had already reached such a realm?</p><p>This thought emerged in the hearts of the Lu family members. Then, their hearts burned with passion and their eyes were filled with infinite anticipation.</p><p>It had only been a short while and Lu Ming was already so powerful. What realm would Lu Ming reach in a few years or even decades?</p><p>They seemed to see the rapid rise of the Lu family.</p><p>“The second leader is dead, the second leader is dead.”</p><p>The dry bone bandits exclaimed.</p><p>“Who’s there? How dare you kill my second brother?”</p><p>The dry bone bandits roared.</p><p>A burly man riding on a leopard rushed out of the crowd, his roar like thunder.</p><p>“Young lord, he’s the leader of the skeleton bandits.”</p><p>One of the core elders said.</p><p>“Just kill him!”</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cold voice rang out, he leaped off the dark blood Wolf’s back and crossed over twenty meters before landing on the ground. Then, he stomped on the ground heavily. With a bang, the ground shook and Lu Ming’s body shot out like a cannonball.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the dry bone Bandit leader.</p><p>“How could he be so fast?”</p><p>The dry bone Bandit leader turned pale with fright. Lu Ming’s speed was too fast, so fast that he was shocked.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The dry bone Bandit leader roared in shock. He slashed with all his might, trying to force Lu Ming to retreat.</p><p>But in the next moment, he was in despair.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword light was too fast. It was so fast that he could not Dodge it in time.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A head flew high into the air and landed in the middle of the withered bones Daoist’s group.</p><p>The entire place fell into silence.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s loud roar woke everyone up.</p><p>kill, kill! Follow the young master and kill all the bandits!</p><p>“Let’s charge!”</p><p>The five core elders shouted with all their might. Their old faces were red with excitement as they rode on their green scaled horses and charged towards the Psammophis Pirates and the dry bone Pirates.</p><p>“Kill! Follow the young master and kill all the bandits!”</p><p>The other members of the Lu clan shouted one after another. With hundreds of people together, their voices were rolling and their morale was high.</p><p>On the other hand, the first and second leaders of the dry bone bandits had been killed by Lu Ming in succession. They were already scared out of their wits and did not have the courage to resist. They retreated one after another and it was a mess.</p><p>At this time, a group of people rushed out of the Lu family’s refined iron mine, causing more chaos between the two gangs of bandits.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the group of bandits. With a flash of his sword, rows of bandits were killed.</p><p>Every one of these bandits had blood on their hands. They were all people who deserved to die. Lu Ming did not show any mercy.</p><p>In his hands, the bandits could not resist at all. He was harvesting lives to his heart’s content.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming passed by, a large number of corpses would fall. It was a one-sided battle, and the bandits had almost no power to resist.</p><p>Not long after, the entire area was filled with corpses.</p><p>Three to four hundred bandits were all killed.</p><p>hahaha, the Psammophis Pirates and the dry bone Pirates have been annihilated. Long live the young master!</p><p>“Long live the invincible young master!”</p><p>The people of the Lu family cheered.</p><p>It took a long time before it gradually calmed down.</p><p>After that, a group of people were left behind to clean up the battlefield. The five core elders took a group of people and returned to the Lu family with Lu Ming.</p><p>The news of this battle quickly spread throughout the entire fiery wind city.</p><p>Countless people were shocked by this news.</p><p>The first and second leaders of the fifth grade master realm and fourth grade master realm were no match for Lu Ming’s single move. They were easily killed by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>It was simply too shocking.</p><p>Li Ping was the happiest of them all.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the happier she would be.</p><p>After that, the Lu family held a grand banquet, and the famous people of fiery wind city came to congratulate them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only responded casually and found an excuse to go back to his room to cultivate.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
