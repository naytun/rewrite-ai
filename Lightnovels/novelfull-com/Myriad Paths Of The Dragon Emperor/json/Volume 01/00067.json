He must be killed! Lu Ming is definitely the top genius of the mystical sword sect. If he escapes, the Zhu family will be annihilated!</p><p>Zhu Bing roared in his heart, and the killing intent in his eyes became even more intense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst forth as Zhu Bing unleashed the power of his bloodline.</p><p>Zhu Bing’s bloodline was a red snake, which was a third-level bloodline. After it was activated, it would increase his combat power by 30%.</p><p>“Die! Fire gun technique-fire dance!”</p><p>Zhu Bing charged at Lu Ming. With a swing of the spear in his hand, flowers of flames appeared and enveloped Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Ultimate flowing light!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the fastest move of the lustrous sword technique and slashed out sword beams at the flame flowers.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>A concentrated sound of collision was heard. Sparks flew in all directions and Lu Ming’s figure retreated several steps.</p><p>what a powerful spear technique. The power of this spear technique has already surpassed my current Moonbeam sword technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>He had already cultivated the lustrous sword technique to the fifth level. Could it be that Zhu Bing had also cultivated a yellow level upper class martial arts technique and had already cultivated it to the sixth level?</p><p>Otherwise, how could he be so strong?</p><p>“Fire gun art-lightning chase!”</p><p>Zhu Bing’s body swayed slightly and he thrust his spear at Lu Ming again.</p><p>The speed of the spear was unbelievably fast, like a red lightning. The long spear pierced through the air, making an ear-piercing sharp sound.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and used the Dragon serpent steps to avoid the sharp edge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>“Fire gun art-moon pulling!”</p><p>As his spear missed, Zhu Bing’s spear momentum changed and swept out.</p><p>The long spear swept out like a crescent moon.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his long sword. At the same time, he retreated rapidly, using the force to dissipate the force.</p><p>this Zhu Bing’s actual combat strength is not as strong as Ning Feng’s. However, with this spear art, his strength is slightly above Ning Feng’S.</p><p>“This won’t do. I have to end this quickly.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>At this moment, the Zhou family was already at a complete disadvantage. They could not wait any longer. Otherwise, when the elders of the Zhu family were free to attack him together, he would have a headache.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming dashed towards Zhu Bing with a flash of blood-red light on his body.</p><p>Bloodline explosion!</p><p>die! Fire gun art-broken armor!</p><p>Zhu Bing’s spear was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The tip of the spear had a spinning cutting power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care. He just had to avoid the real tip of the spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>He swung his long sword and blocked the tip of the spear. Then, Lu Ming glided along the spear and threw a punch.</p><p>He completely ignored the spinning cutting power that erupted from the long spear.</p><p>Lu Ming now had a fourth-level Blood Meridian. When his Blood Meridian exploded, his combat strength increased by 40%.</p><p>There was no way to block this punch!</p><p>Although Zhu Bing struck out with his other hand, he could only use 50% of his essential Qi in a hurry. How could he block Lu Ming?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a loud boom, Zhu Bing’s body trembled violently and he was forced back a dozen steps. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used the Dragon serpent steps, covering 70 feet with a single step. He appeared in front of Zhu Bing in an instant, and a ray of sword radiance flashed past like a flying immortal.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Zhu Bing’s head flew far away, and his eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>The Zhu family’s patriarch, Zhu Bing, was killed by Lu Ming with a single slash despite all his efforts.</p><p>this Zhu family’s patriarch actually has a storage ring. I’m lucky.</p><p>He had clearly seen that the Zhu family’s patriarch’s spear had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>However, thinking about it, the Zhu family’s patriarch had lived for so many years. It was still possible for him to find a way to get a storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the front of Zhu Bing’s corpse and took off a ring on his finger. He kept it in the Supreme shrine and a devouring force was produced, devouring Zhu Bing’s blood essence.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>“The ancestor is dead!”</p><p>The Zhu family’s patriarch was killed, and the Zhu family was in chaos.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without the Zhu clan’s patriarch’s control, the three ghosts of Mount Yin immediately roared and attacked in a disorderly manner.</p><p>No matter if it was the Zhu family or the Zhou family, they attacked without any pattern, like a few wild beasts that had gone mad.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>At this time, Zhou Linshan and the rest of the Zhou family retreated quickly and then attacked the rest of the Zhu family.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned his surroundings. He sneered,”Zhu family, I, Lu Ming, am not that easy to deceive. If you lie to me, you have to pay the price.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flickered as he charged at the Zhu family elders.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Zhu family’s elders were all at the sixth grade master realm, but they were no match for Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s sword-light left a trail of corpses in its wake.</p><p>Their blood essence had been devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing a few Zhu family elders, Lu Ming did not continue to attack. Instead, his body flashed and he focused on devouring the blood essence of those who had already died in battle.</p><p>As long as they were martial masters or above, he would devour their blood essence.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Waves of energy gushed out from his blood and surged into his body. Lu Ming absorbed them and turned them into essential Qi.</p><p>When all the blood essence was refined, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the peak of the middle fifth grade master realm. He was just one step away from the late fifth grade master realm.</p><p>At this moment, the battle was coming to an end. The Zhu family’s patriarch and a few other elders were all killed by Lu Ming. How could the remaining few elders be a match for Zhou Linshan and the rest? They were also killed one by one.</p><p>When the other Zhu clan disciples saw the situation, their morale completely fell and they fled for their lives.</p><p>Corpses were left on the mountain path and in the forest. The smell of blood filled the air, making it look like a purgatory on earth.</p><p>In this battle, the Zhu family left behind more than two hundred corpses, and the Zhou family also lost more than a hundred people.</p><p>However, none of the Zhou clan’s higher-ups were dead, while almost all of the Zhu clan’s higher-ups were dead.</p><p>One could imagine that after this battle, the Zhu family was bound to be swallowed up by the Zhou family.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not concerned about all this.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The three ghosts of Mount Yin, Xu Feiyun, and the others were still roaring, but they had obviously exhausted all their strength. They lay limply on the ground and soon stopped breathing.</p><p>“This young hero, thank you for saving me this time.”</p><p>At this moment, Zhou Linshan walked over and cupped his fists at Lu Ming. He bowed to him and expressed his sincere gratitude.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not made a move and killed the Zhu family’s patriarch and a few elders, the outcome would have been completely reversed.</p><p>He was sincerely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re welcome, Zhou family head. I was only protecting myself.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on the person’s face as he cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p>Zhou Linshan smiled faintly. However, when his gaze fell on the long sword in Lu Ming’s hand, his expression changed and he cried out,”The Heavenly Star sword, why is the Heavenly Star sword in your hands?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, Lu Ming’s heart trembled. His eyes lit up and he said,”How do you know the name of this sword? Do you know my father?”</p><p>“Your father? Could it be that you’re brother Yuntian’s son?”</p><p>Zhou Linshan was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m lu Yuntian’s son.”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his gaze on Zhou Linshan.</p><p>“Hahaha, I was the one who personally gave this Heavenly Star sword to your mother. How could I not know what this sword is called?”</p><p>Zhou Linshan laughed out loud, looking very excited.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
