His attack was extremely overbearing. As he slashed out, the sword radiance formed a cross and slashed down at Lu Ming. Its power was immense.</p><p>“Broken armor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled. The tip of the spear formed a spinning cutting force that collided with Zheng Jiao’s sword gleam.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a loud explosion. Lu Ming took two steps back while Zheng Jiao took three steps back.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>“This Zheng, how can his attack be so strong? The martial skill he used is clearly not a black grade martial skill, but a yellow grade upper level martial skill. Although it has already been cultivated to an extremely high level, its attack power can’t possibly be this strong?”</p><p>There was a flash of suspicion in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Although Zheng’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth grade master realm and he had even activated a fifth level Blood Meridian, without a black level martial arts technique, it was impossible for his attack power to be so strong. He was actually only at a slight disadvantage when he fought Lu Ming head-on.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi was three times more condensed than ordinary essential Qi. In addition, he had already cultivated the flaming gun technique to the second level. Lu Ming could defeat an ordinary ninth grade Peak Master realm martial artist in one move.</p><p>“Oh right, it’s the body. This Zheng Zha’s body is extremely strong. He should have cultivated the path of body refinement.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He discovered that Zheng gan’s muscles were bulging, and his skin was covered with a faint red glow.</p><p>It must be his physical body. Zheng Zheng had cultivated a body-tempering technique. When his physical body was combined with essential Qi, he could erupt with astonishing combat power. That was why he could fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light was rapidly piercing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“How troublesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He swung his long spear and it collided with a thin sword. A figure retreated far away.</p><p>It was the ninth grade master realm disciple from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>Although the disciple’s attack power was not strong, his body movement was not weak. He was slippery and sneaky. He took advantage of Lu Ming’s flaws to launch a sneak attack.</p><p>if I use my bloodline power, I can defeat them easily. However, I can’t always rely on my bloodline power. It can only be used as a trump card and can’t be used in regular battles. I’ll just rely on my current state to finish them off.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged toward Zheng Jian.</p><p>“Landslide!”</p><p>The long spear came down from above and smashed down heavily.</p><p>Zheng’s eyes focused, and he used his sword to block.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The rock under Zheng’s feet shattered, and he retreated.</p><p>“He’s only at the early stage of the eighth grade master realm. Even though he’s cultivated a black grade martial skill, how can he be so powerful? My physical body has already been cultivated to complete grade one, but I’m still no match for him.”</p><p>Zheng Qian’s shock could not be any greater.</p><p>It was normal to suppress him if they were of the same level. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the early stage of the eighth grade master realm. How did he do it?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was like a rainbow. He continuously attacked Zheng, using Zheng to practice his spear technique.</p><p>The surging Dragon-shaped vital energy was continuously infused into the long spear. It was extremely smooth. One spear after another, Lu Ming was like an invincible general who was galloping on the battlefield.</p><p>Zheng was completely suppressed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light suddenly stabbed toward Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>“I’m just waiting for you to make your move!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He swept his long spear across without turning his head.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>A ray of red moonlight flashed, and the ninth grade master realm disciple was shocked. He used his movement technique to retreat.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The spear was eight feet long, and with the arm ruler, the three-meter distance was completely covered.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The ninth grade master realm Shifang Sword School disciple turned pale with fright and used his long sword to block in front of him.</p><p>However, his long sword was thin, so it couldn’t be blocked at the root.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear struck his long sword. A violent force exploded and the long sword bent. The body of the sword and the body of the spear struck his chest heavily.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Shifang Sword School disciple’s body was sent flying like a sandbag. His body was stuck to the ground and slid for dozens of meters, creating a deep ditch on the hard ground.</p><p>By the time he stopped, he was no longer breathing.</p><p>A ninth grade master realm expert was killed by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>After sending the ninth grade master realm disciple flying, Lu Ming’s long spear did not stop. It continued to move forward and clashed with Zheng Jiao’s attack.</p><p>now, there’s no one to disturb me. I can finish you off.</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. He took a step forward and his long spear struck out like lightning.</p><p>Zheng did his best to block.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>The more Lu Ming fought, the more courageous he became. His understanding of the fire gun art became deeper and his power became greater. Zheng was completely outmatched and was forced to retreat.</p><p>Not far away, the flat-nosed young man’s face turned pale. He suddenly shouted, ” senior brother Zheng, hold on for now. I’ll return to the sect first and report to the elders to avenge you.</p><p>Then, he ran away.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Zheng roared.</p><p>“He does deserve to die. Don’t worry, after I’m done with you, I’ll kill him for you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear struck Zheng’s sword, causing him to retreat, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The repeated battles had caused his muscles to tremble non-stop. The web between his thumb and forefinger had split open, and blood was seeping out.</p><p>If it was not for his strong physical body that allowed him to unleash his essential Qi without thinking of the consequences, he would have been killed by Lu Ming. Even so, he was severely injured.</p><p>true Qi! His true Qi is too powerful! It’s unstoppable!</p><p>Zheng’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Wait a minute. As long as you let me go, I can forget about the fact that you killed so many of my ten directions Sword school’s disciples. I won’t pursue this matter. Otherwise, you won’t be able to withstand the anger of the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>Zheng Qian shouted timidly.</p><p>you’re still threatening me at a time like this? what an idiot!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. The long spear did not stop and it was aimed at Zheng Jiao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Teng, Teng, Teng!</p><p>Zheng Qian retreated seven or eight steps, coughing up large mouthfuls of blood. His injuries had worsened.</p><p>“Stop, stop, treasure! There are treasures in that extinct volcano. As long as you spare me, I can give you half, yes, half.”</p><p>Zheng shouted.</p><p>“No need. As long as I kill you, everything will be mine. I’m not going to play with you anymore. That Junior Brother of yours has already run far away. If you continue playing, he might really get away.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips twitched and his body suddenly flashed red.</p><p>Bloodline explosion!</p><p>He had tested enough, so there was no need to keep it.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear turned into a bolt of lightning, much faster than before. Zheng couldn’t block it at all.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Zheng shouted.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through his heart.</p><p>Zheng’s hands tightly gripped the spear, his eyes filled with unwillingness. Blood continuously flowed out of his mouth as he hoarsely shouted,”You … Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out his long spear and stomped on the ground. He chased after the flat-nosed young man like a bolt of lightning. Then, his voice came from afar,”Lu Ming of the mystical sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure had already disappeared.</p><p>“The mystical sword sect?”</p><p>Zheng muttered, the life in his eyes quickly dissipating.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
