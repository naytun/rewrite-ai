You might just catch the envoys’ attention and get recruited into the Mystical Sword Sect!”</p><p>As Lu Yunfeng finished his sentence, the breathing of the Lu Family’s youngsters quickened. They were getting worked up, preparing themselves for a fight.</p><p>In normal circumstances, the Mystical Sword Sect would only be open for recruits in two months, but when that happened, it would be a competition amongst nearly two thousand cities within the Blazing Sun Empire. The chances of winning were too small.</p><p>However, if they caught the interest of any envoys from the Mystical Sword Sect, they would instantly be recommended into the sect. It would be smooth sailing from then on.</p><p>The envoys on the main grandstand smiled. Making no retorts meant that they were in silent agreement. The eyes of the Lu Family’s youngsters shined brightly.</p><p>Lu Yunfeng saw that he had achieved his goals. A joyful look formed on his face as he announced, “Alright, the House Meeting officially starts now! This meeting will be divided into three sections. A test of resolve in the first, a test of meridians on the second, and a tournament for the last section.”</p><p>“As everybody knows, the road of a martial artist is filled with difficulties and challenges. One has to take a single step at a time. Without a strong will, it is impossible to go far on this road. For those who want to participate in the House Meeting, step up, and ascend the Flaming Steps!”</p><p>At the end of the speech, young boys and girls of the Lu Family approached the platform from the sides.</p><p>They were all the new youngsters of the Lu Family. The genders were mixed, but none of them were above the age of eighteen.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Yao’s figure rose on the main grandstand. Instantaneously, the entire crowd’s gaze focused on her.</p><p>Lu Yao was in a snow-white dress. She had a slim figure with desirable curves. Along with fair skin that was as smooth as jade and her perfect face, it was as if she was a fairy who walked out from a picture.</p><p>A gossiper had once said that Lu Yao was the fairest maiden in Fiery Wind City. It was truly not an exaggeration.</p><p>She walked towards the platform in the middle of the training field with soft graceful steps.</p><p>“Absolutely stunning!”</p><p>Many people exclaimed in their hearts.</p><p>Not only did Lu Yao stand out amongst the crowd, but she was also blessed with unparalleled talent.</p><p>“I heard that Lu Yao had already opened up nine meridians before awakening her blood meridian. The moment she awakened the Fifth Level meridian, she followed it up with a divine meridian. She should be even better now. There would really be no regrets left in life if anyone could be able to marry such a blessed girl.”</p><p>“I heard that Lu Yao has marital ties with the prodigy of the Duanmu Family, Duanmu Lin, from the White Tiger Hall. Perhaps only someone on Duanmu Lin’s level would be a match for her!”</p><p>“I heard that Lu Yao and Lu Ming from the main branch were close. I thought they were a thing!”</p><p>“That piece of trash? How could he ever be worthy of her? It would have been sticking a fresh flower on cow dung! Thank God they didn’t end up together, or he would have been awfully unfair!”</p><p>Everyone was in discussion.</p><p>Amidst the crowd, Lu Ming heard the speculations and gently smiled.</p><p>He would soon shut them up.</p><p>In a while, Lu Yao stepped onto the stage. Her juniors of the same family that were beside her were eclipsed by Lu Yao’s mere presence.</p><p>The envoys from the main grandstand had their eyes fixed on her. After all, they did come for her.</p><p>At that moment, there were over thirty youngsters of mixed genders from the Lu Family onstage.</p><p>“Is there anyone who has yet to come?” The Second Elder asked loudly.</p><p>In that instant, a figure walked out from the crowd and slowly approached the stage.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>Seeing the figure shocked many people.</p><p>“Isn’t that the piece of trash from the main branch, Lu Ming? What? Does he want to participate in the House Meeting’s test?”</p><p>Many people were perplexed.</p><p>On the grandstand, the First Branch Elder’s eyes dimmed. He never expected that Lu Ming would dare to come.</p><p>Lu Family’s Seven Core Elders who sat atop everyone were also curious and puzzled.</p><p>“Ming’er!” In the crowd, Li Ping and Qiu Yue’s hands were tightly linked together.</p><p>On the stage, Lu Yao furrowed her brows when she saw Lu Ming. “Lu Ming, why did you come up? You don’t belong here, get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not respond, he only stared at her.</p><p>It was the first time that Lu Ming met Lu Yao after his blood meridian was stripped away from him. The figure in front of him that he used to love could no longer give him the slightest sense of warmth. Now, all that was left in his eyes was coldness.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s looks, Lu Yao shook her head. “Lu Ming, I know that you’re upset over me succeeding in the Lord’s position even though you’re the descendent of the main branch, but you should be clear about your current condition. The position of the Lord belongs to the capable. There’s too great of a distance between you and me, a massive channel that’s difficult to cross.</p><p>The two of us are destined in different worlds. My world has only begun, while yours is fated to be ordinary. It’s the end of the line for you!”</p><p>“Is that so? You’re pretty confident, but you got one thing right. We do belong in different worlds.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He then stood at one side, ignoring Lu Yao.</p><p>He did not come today to waste words, but rather to let his actions speak for themselves.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The First Branch Elder shouted coolly from the main stage.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at the First Branch Elder. He wanted to hear what the old fogey had to say.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t condense Essential Qi as you were born frail and weak. Seeing how you were the descendent of the main branch of our family, Lu Yao was kind enough to keep you company and motivate you with encouragement. If you were able to awake a blood meridian like your father’s, you would be able to succeed in the Lord’s position.</p><p>Nothing can be done if you can’t even awaken a blood meridian. Naturally, you won’t be able to succeed in the Lord’s position. Coincidentally, Yao’er awakened a Fifth Level blood meridian and acquired the favor of the Duanmu Family’s prodigy, who is asking for her hand.</p><p>You took it to heart! Not only did you forget how well Yao’er treated you, but you’ve also fantasized about her and planned to make a move. You even tried to break the marital ties between Yao’er and the Duanmu Family. Absolutely offensive! However, seeing how you’re the descendent of the main branch and the only son of Brother Yuntian, I’m willing to let bygones be bygones. Now, get off the stage!”</p><p>The First Branch Elder’s voice echoed dully.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming was so detestable? Miss Lu Yao kept him company for so many years to take care of him, but he was that delirious and would bite the hand that fed him?”</p><p>“How detestable. No wonder he’s a piece of trash.”</p><p>The moment the crowd heard the First Branch Elder’s speech, they all glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Yunxiong, d-don’t blabber nonsense.”</p><p>Amidst the crowd, Lu Ping shouted as she pointed at the First Branch Elder. Her entire body was shaking.</p><p>“Mother, there is no need to argue with someone like him.”</p><p>Lu Ming told Li Ping.</p><p>The First Branch Elder was the lowest of low. It was them who were the despicable ones that planned for three years to bring Lu Ming down and snatch his blood meridian away from him, but they were twisting the facts, even accusing him of attempted rape, and accusing him of ruining the marital ties between Lu Yao and the Duanmu family.</p><p>Lu Yao could not be bothered to talk to someone like him. The truth would soon be revealed.</p><p>“There’s actually someone like that? Absolutely abominable! Not only is he someone like that, but he’s also a piece of trash that can’t even awaken a blood meridian. What’s the point of staying on the stage? Hurry up and scram!” The White Tiger Hall’s envoy, Duanmu Qing, sneered.</p><p>“Who the f*ck are you? This is my family’s House Meeting, who are you to butt in?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at Duanmu Qing, he was not giving him any face.</p><p>“The audacity! How dare you? Do you know who I am?” Duanmu Qing stood up in a rage as he bellowed; he was laced with killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you piece of trash. How dare you offend the envoy of the Mystical Sword Sect’s White Tiger Hall?” The First Branch Elder pointed at Lu Ming and yelled.</p><p>“I don’t care who he is. Also, Lu Yunxiong, today is our family’s House Meeting. You are planning to deal with the descendent of the main branch with outsiders? Do you think the Core Elders are just for show?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at Duanmu Qing and the First Branch Elder. His words were clear and concise as it echoed across the entire venue.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was dumbfounded. Lu Ming was too daring, to the point where he would dare to offend the envoy of the Mystical Sword Sect.</p><p>“You…” The First Branch Elder’s face was flushed.</p><p>“Alright, Yunxiong, as well as Duanmu Qing. Please let this slide under the account of Lu Ming’s youthful arrogance.”</p><p>As expected, one of the Core Elders of the Elder Council spoke up.</p><p>They would not favor a side, choosing to protect the Lu Family’s best interests and would even protect the rights of the main branch, or they would not have spent the resources to awaken Lu Ming’s blood meridian through an altar ritual.</p><p>“That’s right, Duanmu Qing. Why are you bickering with a junior? Aren’t you embarrassed?” Mu Lan said as she glanced at Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Duanmu Qing sneered. However, he seemed to be wary of Mu Lan. He remained silent as he sat down with a sour expression on his face.</p><p>The First Elder seated himself as well, his face was ghastly pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming, once Yao’er takes control over the family, let’s see how you’ll fare.” The First Elder’s eyes were dark.</p><p>“Alright, the House Meeting doesn’t have any rules where anyone without an awakened blood meridian can’t participate. Lu Ming is eligible to join, let’s start now,” a Core Elder announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
