The reward has actually reached one hundred thousand taels of silver, and he is also heading to the dark blood Mountain.”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up again.</p><p>He saw an escort mission issued by the Zhu family of the city of crossing sky. The reward for escorting one person to the dark blood Mountain was 100000 silver taels.</p><p>“This one.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming decided to accept this mission.</p><p>Because it happened to be on the way.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming walked to a counter and registered the two missions that he was going to take.</p><p>this is the mission token issued by the Zhu family. Please keep it well.</p><p>At the counter was a young lady with a sweet smile. She handed Lu Ming an iron plate with the word ‘Zhu Yi’ written on it.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said.</p><p>Lu Ming took the metal piece and smiled. He then turned around and left.</p><p>Two hours later, on the main road of the mystical sword sect’s Mountain Gate, Lu Ming rode his green scale horse and left.</p><p>Five days later, travel-worn Lu Ming arrived at the skycrossing city.</p><p>The skycrossing city was a large and majestic city, several times larger than fiery wind city.</p><p>The streets were bustling with people.</p><p>The Zhu family was known as the number one family in the sky Crossing City.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to go to the Zhu family’s residence as the time was set for tomorrow. There was still one day left. There was no hurry.</p><p>Lu Ming found an Inn and cleaned himself up. Then, he took a tour around the city and got a taste of its local customs. The next day, Lu Ming headed to the Zhu family.</p><p>The Zhu family’s courtyard walls were high and many times more majestic than the Lu family’s.</p><p>stop right there. This is the Zhu family’s residence. Unauthorized people are not allowed to enter.</p><p>There were four strong men guarding the Zhu family’s Gate. They blocked Lu Ming’s way.</p><p>Each of the four men had the cultivation of a ninth grade warrior realm.</p><p>“I’m here to complete a mission.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took out the mission card issued by the Zhu family.</p><p>“As expected.”</p><p>The brawny man in the lead took a look and cast a surprised look at Lu Ming. He seemed to be surprised that Lu Ming was so young.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>The brawny man in the lead returned the mission card to Lu Ming and led the way inside.</p><p>Lu Ming followed.</p><p>After going around here and there, he arrived at a large hall.</p><p>Walking into the main hall, he found that there were already some people sitting on both sides of the main hall.</p><p>There were a total of seven people.</p><p>These seven people were all different.</p><p>On the right side of the hall, there were three people, two men and one woman. They were all around 50 years old. All three of them were wearing black robes with skulls on them, and they exuded a gloomy aura.</p><p>On the left, a red-haired brawny man in his forties or fifties was sitting at the head of the table.</p><p>Beside the brawny man were a man and a woman. The man was an old man with white hair and the woman was a middle-aged woman in her thirties.</p><p>At the very bottom was a young man in his twenties. This man was hugging a long sword, looking like a noble son.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, the seven people in the hall looked at him in unison.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming’s age, they looked at him with disdain.</p><p>young hero, they are the people who accepted the mission this time. You can wait here. My master will be here in a moment.</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked in. He sat down next to the three people in skeletal robes.</p><p>a little brat who hasn’t even grown his hair has actually come. He must have gone crazy thinking about money. He actually came to accept this mission.</p><p>At this moment, a low sneer came from the red-haired brawny man.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He looked at the red-haired brawny man, then smiled faintly and ignored him.</p><p>“You’re really gutless!”</p><p>The red-haired man sneered.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not even dare to talk back, the rest of the people looked at him with disdain.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh was heard.</p><p>A burly man in his forties walked in and cupped his fists. “I’ve made everyone wait for a long time. I’m the second elder of the Zhu family, Zhu Chuan. It’s my pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“You’re too polite, second elder!”</p><p>These people responded with cupped fists.</p><p>Zhu Chuan walked up to the top of the hall and said, ” alright. The Zhu family has issued a total of eight mission tokens this time. Now that everyone is here, I’ll briefly explain the contents of this mission.</p><p>“I won’t hide it from you all. The main reason I’m here is because the ancestor of my Zhu family was seriously injured in the dark blood Mountain. I need the blood of the direct descendants of the Zhu family to save my life. I also need a vitality supplement pill. Therefore, I’m here to escort the eldest miss of the Zhu family and the vitality supplement pill in her hands to the dark blood Mountain.”</p><p>“Because there are many powerful bandits and mounted gangsters on the way to the dark blood Mountain, I need everyone to escort them. As long as you send the people and the pills to the ancestor of my Zhu family, it will be enough. The reward is 100000 silver taels per person.”</p><p>“Do you have any other questions?”</p><p>Zhu Chuan’s gaze swept across the eight people in the arena.</p><p>“There’s a problem, of course there’s a problem.”</p><p>The red-haired man stood up and said, ” “Second elder, I would like to ask if you’ve tested the strength of these eight people?”</p><p>Zhu Chuan was taken aback. no, but you’re Wu mo the bloody hand, and these three are the famous three ghosts of Mount Yin. They’re famous in more than ten big cities. Everyone knows them.</p><p>“I’m naturally aware of the strength of the three ghosts of Mount Yin. I’m just afraid that one of them is just here to make up for the numbers. If he doesn’t have much strength and can just freeload off to earn a hundred thousand taels of silver, why don’t we do this? The three ghosts of the yin mountain and I will be in charge of this mission. The rest of you, get lost and split the silver with the four of us. That’s even better.”</p><p>Wu mo said with a cold smile.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>As soon as Wu mo finished speaking, the noble young master slammed the table and said with a cold face, ” “Wu mo, who are you asking to get lost?”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Wu mo sneered and said,”I’m calling you. Can’t you tell?” Damn it, you two still wet behind the ears want to borrow my strength to earn a hundred thousand taels of silver? no way!”</p><p>After saying that, he glanced at Lu Ming and said disdainfully, ”</p><p>The noble young master’s face turned completely cold. He said coldly, ” “Blood hand Wu mo, I think you don’t want your hands anymore.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Wu mo suddenly stood up and looked at the noble young master coldly. “I’m going to cripple you today just because of what you said.”</p><p>Hu!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Wu mo struck his palm at the young master. His palm quickly turned red as he did so, and the smell of blood permeated the air.</p><p>what a powerful bloody handprint! Wu Mo’s bloody handprint has reached a higher level.</p><p>The white-haired old man’s face changed.</p><p>sixth grade master realm early phase cultivation, yellow grade low level martial arts technique, but only cultivated to the third level, mastery through comprehensive study.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Wu mo. He could see the details of Wu Mo’s cultivation level at a glance.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>die! the noble young master shouted coldly. He unsheathed his sword and stabbed it toward Wu mo like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The speed of the sword shocked Wu mo. He hurriedly retreated to avoid the sword.</p><p>However, the next moment, rays of sword radiance shot toward Wu mo.</p><p>The sword light was as smooth as flowing water.</p><p>middle sixth grade master realm cultivation, fourth stage of yellow level lower class sword technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He didn’t expect this noble young master’s cultivation to be so strong.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
