It was extremely spacious and had no trouble accommodating a hundred thousand people.</p><p>In the middle of the training field, there was an enormous platform that was made from stainless steel rocks that spanned two hundred meters in width and length.</p><p>...</p><p>There were majestic grandstands built on the northern, eastern, and western sides of the training field.</p><p>The northern grandstand was the main grandstand, reserved for the Lu Family. The eastern and western grandstands were for influential families within Fiery Wind City.</p><p>At that moment, seven grey-haired elders sat on the very top of the grandstand. These elders were the seven Elders at the core of the Lu Family’s Elder Council.</p><p>The Core Elders in the Lu Family’s Elder Council were all handpicked by the family themselves as the most qualified and renowned members. They were all working for the sake of the Lu Family, which was why they were the most appropriate and would not be biased towards a particular branch; ultimately having the Lu Family’s best interest at heart.</p><p>Lu Yunxiong, the Lu Family’s First Branch Elder, was seated slightly further down below. At his side, a maiden around the age of fifteen was seated as well. Dressed in a snow-white dress, her beauty was simply indescribable. It was Lu Yao.</p><p>“First Branch Elder Lu, congratulations! I heard your daughter has unparalleled talent, awakening a Fifth Level blood meridian. Her future is limitless!”</p><p>The Li Family’s Lord, Li Fu, congratulated the First Branch Elder with flattery.</p><p>“Thank you,” the First Branch Elder replied simply.</p><p>All other families and renowned figures in the Fiery Wind City then approached the First Branch Elder to congratulate him.</p><p>The First Branch Elder simply nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At that moment, the roars of wild beasts rang from a distant street. The sound pierced the skies as if there were tens of thousands of demons charging in.</p><p>After a moment, over ten giant blood-red tigers appeared in front of the audience. They were two meters tall and spanned a width over four meters.</p><p>A silhouette donned in a fiery red garb was seated on each giant tiger, and fierce aura along with scorching breath permeated the entire area.</p><p>“Flame Tigers. They’re from the White Tiger Hall, one of the Five Halls of the Mystical Sword Sect.”</p><p>“Could they be from the Duanmu Family’s Lord?”</p><p>1</p><p>There were exclamations coming from the crowd.</p><p>“For the White Tiger Hall to take the initiative in sending someone over, could they be aiming to recruit Lu Yao as a disciple?” Someone guessed.</p><p>The First Branch Elder stood up with a woosh and descended the grandstand, his face filled with excitement. “For the Mystical Sword Sect’s White Tiger Hall to pay a visit, it is my fault for not welcoming you outside the gates. Please forgive me!” he clasped his fists.</p><p>“Haha, you’re too courteous, First Branch Elder! I am Duanmu Qing, who works for the Mystical Sword Sect’s White Tiger Hall. I am here today to congratulate Lu Yao on the accession as the Lu Family’s Lord, and also to officially recruit Lu Yao as a disciple of the White Tiger Hall,” said a middle-aged man in a fiery red garb who was seated on the largest Flame Tiger.</p><p>“You are too polite, envoy. Please, take a seat,” the First Branch Elder replied with a smile on his face.</p><p>Duanmu Qing smiled. He and another two men dismounted from their Flame Tigers and arrived at the main grandstand. The other people directed their Flame Tigers to the side.</p><p>“It seems that Lu Yao does have terrifying talents. There’s still another two months before the Mystical Sword Sect officially recruits disciples, and people would normally be the ones to approach them. They would have to go through strict tests, and only the ones who passed would be able to join. It’s truly a rare sight for the Mystical Sword Sect to personally come and recruit someone.”</p><p>“Indeed! They say that Lu Yao has attracted the attention of a genius from the Duanmu Family of the Mystical Sword Sect. Her future looks really promising!”</p><p>“The Lu Family really got themselves an extraordinary genius this time, one that outshines even Lu Yuntian!”</p><p>The people all around were discussing heatedly.</p><p>Shriek!</p><p>At that moment, a loud, sharp cry resounded through the sky. Even if it was from a great distance, it could still be heard.</p><p>The crowd’s eyes involuntarily darted in that direction. Then, their eyes widened in awe.</p><p>There was a gigantic snow-white goshawk with a wingspan of fifty meters.</p><p>It had talons as pointed as blades, and its eyes were extremely sharp. The crowd shivered and broke into a sweat as the goshawk scanned its eyes across the people.</p><p>Several figures stood atop the goshawk.</p><p>“A silent snow goshawk. It’s a silent snow goshawk from the Mystical Sword Sect’s Vermillion Bird Hall.”</p><p>“Even the Vermillion Bird Hall has arrived!”</p><p>The crowd exclaimed.</p><p>“I am Liu Qian from the Mystical Sword Sect’s Vermillion Bird Hall. I have come today representing the Vermillion Bird Hall to recruit Lu Yao as a disciple,” said a lady around the age of thirty, gracefully perched atop the silent snow goshawk.</p><p>1</p><p>Sstttt…</p><p>At that moment, an immense flying snake soared over from a distance. It had a fierce aura that seeped through the entire place.</p><p>“Haha, Duanmu Qing, Liu Qian, your halls are pretty quick to take action. I am Tie Zhong from the Mystical Sword Sect’s Azure Dragon Hall, representing my hall to recruit Miss Lu Yao as a disciple.”</p><p>“I am Gao Shi from the Onyx Tortoise Hall, representing my hall to recruit Miss Lu Yao as a disciple.” Another voice followed.</p><p>The empire Lu Ming was in was named the Blazing Sun Empire.</p><p>The Blazing Sun Empire occupied a vast amount of land. Fiery Wind City was but a mere town in comparison to the empire. The total cities that the empire governed amounted to at least ten thousand.</p><p>There were five sects in the entire Blazing Sun Empire, they were predominant forces that were at the top of the ladder. Conveniently situated at the center of the Blazing Sun Empire, they were the ones governing the empire.</p><p>The Mystical Sword Sect occupied a vast amount of territory within the Blazing Sun Empire. Fiery Wind City was situated in the easternmost spot of the empire, which was within the jurisdiction of the Mystical Sword Sect.</p><p>The Mystical Sword Sect was divided into five halls, namely the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Onyx Tortoise, Vermillion Bird, and Qilin.</p><p>The Duanmu Family was the main family from the White Tiger Hall of the Mystical Sword Sect.</p><p>Although the five halls were from the same sect, there was bound to be an open competition and covert struggles.</p><p>As such, each hall would naturally want to recruit a genius into their own ranks when one appeared.</p><p>The successive arrival of four halls caused a din.</p><p>“Goodness! Out of the Five Halls of the Mystical Sword Sect, there were four that came! All of them are looking to take Miss Lu Yao in as a disciple! Unbelievable!”</p><p>“I know right?! The Mystical Sword Sect oversees nearly two thousand cities. The five halls stand high above the masses, it’s rare of them to send a representative to recruit a disciple, but there’s four this time! Amazing, truly amazing!”</p><p>The surrounding crowd was discussing heatedly.</p><p>It was reasonable for the White Tiger Hall to send a representative to recruit Lu Yao as a disciple, as she had marital ties with the Duanmu Family from the White Tiger Hall.</p><p>However, there were three other halls who also sent someone over with the aim of recruiting Lu Yao as their disciple. It was a testament to Lu Yao’s impressive talent that had shocked even the other halls.</p><p>As four halls of the Mystical Sword Sect wanted to take Lu Yao as their disciple, the glow around her intensified.</p><p>“The three envoys, please take a seat.”</p><p>The First Branch Elder hurriedly invited the guests from the three halls to be seated. He could hardly contain his happiness.</p><p>He was brimming with happiness and had already predicted the arrival of the White Tiger Hall, but the arrival of three other halls was out of his expectations. This increased his reputation.</p><p>“Yao’er, this was all because of you.”</p><p>The First Branch Elder murmured as he clenched his fists. His emotions were surging.</p><p>He knew that the reason why four of the Five Halls would send someone right to their doorstep was all because of Lu Yao, his own daughter.</p><p>At that moment, he sighed emotionally. The three years of effort was not in vain. It was worth it.</p><p>“Vermillion Bird Hall, Azure Dragon Hall, and the Onyx Tortoise Hall, why are you here? Lu Yao belongs to us White Tiger Hall. Are you planning to snatch her away from us?”</p><p>Duanmu Qing was looking at the messengers from the other three halls. His expression seemed sour.</p><p>“Haha, Duanmu Qing, I know that Lu Yao already has marital ties with White Tiger Hall’s Duanmu Lin, but Miss Lu Yao might not want to choose the White Tiger Hall. We all belong to the Mystical Sword Sect, there isn’t any difference in choosing another hall, it all depends on adaptability.”</p><p>Azure Dragon Hall’s Tie Zhong laughed.</p><p>“Hmph, from how I see it, your efforts are in vain.” Duanmu Qing snorted.</p><p>The First Branch Elder, who was seated beside, was even more excited. The Lu Family’s house meeting had not even started yet, but the four halls were already fighting over Lu Yao. His face flushed at the thought of that.</p><p>At that moment, a scent of fragrance wafted over. A graceful figure approached, instantly attracting the attention of everyone.</p><p>“Hall Owner Mu, I did not think you would come. Please, take a seat.” The First Branch Elder quickly welcomed her.</p><p>She was the Hall Owner of the Elixir Hall, Mu Lan.</p><p>The Elixir Hall was backed by the Mystical Sword Sect. The First Branch Elder dared not to neglect her.</p><p>“Martial Aunt Mu, you’ve come as well.”</p><p>The Vermillion Hall’s Liu Qian hurriedly stepped forward for a salute, which startled many people as they started speculating. Mu Lan had quite the position in the Vermillion Bird Hall. Liu Qian was already over thirty years in age but was still addressing Mu Lan as her martial aunt.</p><p>2</p><p>“Yes, I came to watch the fun.”</p><p>“Why is she here?” The expression of the lot from the three other halls changed.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming, Li Ping, and Qiu Yue arrived among the crowd.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
