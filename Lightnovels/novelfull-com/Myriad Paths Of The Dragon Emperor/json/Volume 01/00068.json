He cupped his fists and said,”Lu Ming greets the Zhou family head!”</p><p>“Haha, it’s been so many years since we last met. I didn’t expect you to be so old and have such a profound cultivation base.”</p><p>Zhou Linshan laughed and said, ” “Let’s go over there and talk.”</p><p>Soon after, the two of them arrived at a hillside.</p><p>Zhou Linshan told Lu Ming about him and Lu Yuntian.</p><p>As it turned out, more than eight years ago, when Zhou Linshan was out traveling, Lu Yuntian was the one who saved him when he was in danger.</p><p>Later on, the two of them got along well and became close friends.</p><p>About seven years ago, Lu Yuntian found Zhou Linshan and handed him two items.</p><p>One of them was the Heavenly Star sword, and the other was a bronze pendant.</p><p>He also told Zhou Linshan that if anything happened to him, he should wait for two years before giving the two items to Li Ping secretly.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. It was no wonder that Lu Yuntian had sent these two items two years after he had spread the news that something had happened.</p><p>Before this, he had found it strange.</p><p>“Zhou family head, I want to know, how did my father die? Who killed him?”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>Since Lu Yuntian had given these two items to Zhou Linshan in advance and even said that something would happen to him, it was obvious that Lu Yuntian knew that someone was going to deal with him. That was why he had made such preparations.</p><p>Who was it that wanted to deal with Lu Yuntian? Perhaps Zhou Linshan knew something.</p><p>Sure enough, Zhou Linshan frowned and hesitated for a long time before he said, ” “Lu Ming, your father might not be dead.”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>It was as if Thunder had exploded in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“I’m not … He didn’t die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils dilated rapidly. Then, his heart was filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“Zhou … Uncle Zhou, are you saying that my father is not dead? Then where was he? Why didn’t you come home for so many years?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was trembling. Even his voice was trembling.</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, brother Yuntian should be under someone’s control.”</p><p>Zhou Linshan thought for a while and said.</p><p>“Controlled? Who, who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles cracked. His eyes were red as he asked.</p><p>Zhou Linshan furrowed his brows. After a while, he said, ” “Nephew, I can tell you, but you have to promise me that you won’t act rashly. Otherwise, you’ll just die in vain. Otherwise, I’d rather not tell you than let you die in vain.”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.”Uncle Zhou, don’t worry. I won’t act rashly before I’m strong enough.”</p><p>Seeing the determination in Lu Ming’s eyes, Zhou Linshan heaved a long sigh.”Alright, I’ll tell you. Brother Yuntian is most likely in the imperial capital, and the person who did this should be someone from the ten direction Sword School.”</p><p>“The imperial capital! The ten direction sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly emitted a shocking glow.</p><p>Zhou Linshan was shocked. He quickly said, ” the burning sun Empire’s capital is now under the control of the ten direction sword sect. The ten direction sword sect is the leader of the five great sects of the burning sun Empire. You must not act rashly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, uncle Zhou. I know what to do.”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath.</p><p>Among the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire, the ten direction sword sect was ranked first. They occupied a large area of rich land in the middle of the blazing sun Empire. Their strength was so great that even the mystical sword sect was far inferior to them.</p><p>He naturally wouldn’t rashly go to save her. Otherwise, she would probably be killed before even seeing his father.</p><p>His current strength was many times weaker than the entire ten direction Sword School.</p><p>if father is really just being controlled and hasn’t been killed for so many years, then it’s obvious that father has something that the ten direction Sword School needs. Then, nothing will happen after this!</p><p>however, no one can guarantee such things. Strength, I have to improve my strength as soon as possible. If I’m strong enough now, I can directly kill my way over to the imperial capital and the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>“But it won’t take long, father. I’ll definitely save you.”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with determination and his body was filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“That’s good.ai, it’s all my fault for not being strong enough. All these years, I’ve missed my younger brother Yuntian, but I was unable to save him. Today, I was even saved by my nephew. I really owe you and your father too much.”</p><p>Zhou Linshan sighed.</p><p>uncle Zhou, how can you be blamed for this? after all, the other party is the ten directions Sword School. I’m already very grateful that you can help give us this sword.</p><p>Lu Ming consoled her.</p><p>However, Zhou Linshan continued to sigh. After a while, he asked, ” “Nephew, where do you plan to go next?”</p><p>“I’m planning to go to the dark blood Mountain. There’s a mission to do there.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything.</p><p>“Dark blood Mountain? It’s not far from here, but there are many demonic beasts in the dark blood Mountain, so nephew must be careful. I’m going to send little Rou back now, her father needs the vitality supplement pill.”</p><p>“Nephew, come visit the Zhou family when you have time!”</p><p>Zhou Linshan invited.</p><p>alright, I’ll definitely visit you when I have time. Lu Ming will take his leave now.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and saluted. Then, in a flash, he chose a green scale horse on the mountain road and rode on it, continuing to head towards the direction of the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s back view, Zhou Linshan’s eyes shone with anticipation. He muttered to himself,”Brother Yuntian, nephew Lu Ming has joined the mystical sword sect. He has such a high cultivation base at such a young age. Perhaps he can really save you in the future?”</p><p>……</p><p>The green scale horse galloped madly for more than a hundred miles before Lu Ming stopped in a Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on a green rock, in a daze.</p><p>More than six years ago, when he first found out about Lu Yuntian’s accident, he did not believe it.</p><p>He didn’t believe that the indomitable man in his eyes would die!</p><p>However, as time passed, there was still no news of Lu Yuntian. Lu Ming gradually believed that Lu Yuntian had really died.</p><p>However, today, he suddenly learned that Lu Yuntian might still be alive. He was extremely excited.</p><p>if mother knows about this, she’ll be so happy. No, I can’t let mother know for now. If mother knows that father is in the hands of the ten direction Sword School, she’ll be even more worried.</p><p>“Father, you must wait for me. Ming ‘er will definitely save you. People from the ten direction sword sect, I, Lu Ming, swear that no matter who you are, I will make you pay the price.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts drifted. He recalled the days when Lu Yuntian was still around.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how long had passed before he snapped out of his thoughts.</p><p>Then, with a thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He was currently on the Supreme shrine’s second platform. As for the third platform, he still couldn’t get up there. He didn’t know what cultivation level he would need to get up there.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming picked up the storage ring that he had obtained from Zhu Bing.</p><p>What could be in the storage ring of the Zhu family’s elder?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
