There are a total of fifty-six geniuses from the four halls who have made it onto the bronze list. Feng Wu said.</p><p>“Only fifty-six people?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The mystical sword sect would recruit a batch of disciples every year, and as long as they were not over thirty years old, they would be considered as disciples. After so many years, the mystical sword sect had more than fifty thousand bronze disciples.</p><p>There were more than 50000 people, but only 56 of them were geniuses on the bronze list.</p><p>One had to know that those who could join the mystical sword sect had to go through a series of examinations. It was a sign of talent and one in a hundred was chosen.</p><p>It was obvious how talented the geniuses on the bronze list were.</p><p>“What’s Yao Tianyu’s ranking?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“51st.”</p><p>Feng Wu’s eyes flickered as she scrutinized Lu Ming.”You’re not really thinking of challenging Yao Tianyu, are you? He joined the mystical sword sect two years ago, and I heard that he was a strong contender for the newcomer King during the newcomer’s trial. Although he failed, his talent can not be underestimated!”</p><p>although he’s ranked 51st, his abilities have improved very quickly. I believe that he’ll continue to rise. Lu Ming, it won’t be a problem for you to defeat him in another year. But it’s still too early this year.</p><p>“Fengwu, since you don’t trust me that much, how about we make a bet? I’ll bet on whether I can defeat Yao Tianyu in four months.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Oh? What are we betting on?”</p><p>Feng Wu said.</p><p>“What are we betting on? Let me think!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his chin. Then, his eyes wandered all over Feng Wu’s body.</p><p>From time to time, he would even let out a sigh.</p><p>Feng Wu’s pretty face turned red. She glared at Lu Ming and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, you … You … You’re shameless, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>“Fengwu, why are you scolding me? I just wanted to bet on a big meal to see if you have that much money. You see, my thoughts are not pure, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked surprised.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Feng Wu’s face turned even redder, all the way to her ears. She glared at Lu Ming and said fiercely, ” “Fine, I’ll take the bet. If I don’t rip you off, my name isn’t Feng Wu.”</p><p>Having said that, he threw a jar of medicinal wine at Lu Ming and left in a Huff.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. It was quite interesting to tease the beauty fengwu occasionally.</p><p>He opened the wine jar and gulped down a few mouthfuls. Lu Ming began to consider his future cultivation path.</p><p>it’s too slow to cultivate the basic gun technique like this. If this continues, I don’t know when I’ll be able to cultivate the fire controlling gun technique. I need to use external forces to speed up the cultivation of the basic gun technique.</p><p>If one wanted to be on the bronze list, he had to master a profound level martial arts technique.</p><p>“There it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought when his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Immediately, he gulped down the entire jar of medicinal wine.</p><p>It’s really good wine, but it’s a pity that it has a medicinal smell and lacks a lot of flavor.</p><p>Lu Ming clicked his tongue and walked out.</p><p>The first place he went to was the contribution Hall.</p><p>He exchanged the two million taels of silver for contribution points, so he had a total of twenty thousand contribution points.</p><p>He only had a few hundred thousand silver on him.</p><p>In addition to his previous contribution points, he had a total of 25500 contribution points.</p><p>Then, he started to exchange for the demonic beast blood essence.</p><p>He was going to exchange for the blood essence of a class 8 Lv 2 demonic beast.</p><p>A portion of eighth grade second level demonic beast blood essence was worth 800 contribution points.</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged for twenty sets, which cost him sixteen thousand contribution points.</p><p>It was too expensive. Lu Ming’s heart twitched a few times.</p><p>He had wanted to exchange for some Class 9 Lv 2 demonic beast blood essence, but it cost 1600 contribution points per portion.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He could only put it aside for the time being.</p><p>After exchanging for the demonic beast blood essence, Lu Ming left the mystical sword sect and headed east.</p><p>The layout of the mystical sword sect was rather peculiar. The four halls occupied the four most majestic mountains in the North, South, East, and West.</p><p>The central region was an even wider region.</p><p>In this area, there was not only Qilin Hall, but also the hall of mission, the hall of contribution, the bronze platform, and other important places in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Further north of the Onyx tortoise Hall was the core area of the mystical sword sect. The sect leader, golden-robed elders, golden-ranked disciples, and a portion of silver-robed elders were all cultivating in this area.</p><p>It was the core of the mystical sword sect’s power.</p><p>The east side of the Azure Dragon Hall was connected to a vast mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range was known as the coastal mountain range. It was vast and boundless, and countless demonic beasts lived in it.</p><p>It was said that beyond the mountain range by the sea was the endless sea. It could be said that the blazing sun Empire was at the easternmost part of the entire divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to go to the mountain range by the sea. He wanted to look for an advantageous position to cultivate his spear technique.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to go deep into the mountain range along the coast. He was only at the periphery.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming was about two hundred miles deep.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A waterfall rumbled. The water fell from a height of more than a thousand meters, forming a huge impact that shook everything within a few hundred meters.</p><p>“This is the place. I’ll use this waterfall to cultivate.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out his fire-patterned gun and walked slowly toward the waterfall from the side.</p><p>The silver water column fell from a height of over a thousand meters, and its momentum was extremely shocking. The closer they got, the more they could feel the majestic power.</p><p>“To practice the spear, the first step is to practice spear-wielding. Only when you hold the spear steadily will you be able to grasp the other basic spear techniques.”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming grabbed the end of the spear with one hand, stretched his hand straight, and extended the body of the spear into the waterfall.</p><p>The moment the body of the spear was washed by the water from the waterfall, Lu Ming felt an extremely strong pressure pressing on the body of the spear. He bent his wrist and threw the long spear down.</p><p>With a burst of true Qi, he pulled the spear back with great force.</p><p>what a strong force. It’s not stable at all. However, this is also a good place to cultivate. Continue!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and determined.</p><p>He continued to extend the spear, and true energy continued to flow into the spear.</p><p>This time, he managed to hold on for two more breaths before the spear was thrown down by the waterfall.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming was not discouraged. He started to cultivate again and again.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that cultivating the way he held the spear consumed a terrifying amount of essential Qi. Every once in a while, Lu Ming would have to stand aside and circulate the true war Dragon technique to recover his essential Qi.</p><p>Of course, there were also benefits to this. Every time his genuine Qi was squeezed dry, he would cultivate and replenish it. This would make his genuine Qi more condensed and his Foundation more stable.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming would occasionally devour and refine a portion of demonic beast blood essence. His cultivation level was rapidly improving.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming could already hold the spear for more than ten minutes in the waterfall. However, it was very unstable and the long spear swayed back and forth in the water.</p><p>However, this was already a huge improvement.</p><p>For another seven days, the long spear in the waterfall was stable. No matter how the water of the waterfall hit it, the long spear did not move at all.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
