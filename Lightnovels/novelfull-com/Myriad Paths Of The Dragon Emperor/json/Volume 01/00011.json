There were two manuals and a jade box inside.</p><p>...</p><p>One of the manuals was made of something suspiciously similar to gold instead of paper. It was probably over a hundred pages long, but it seemed like it was weightless when held in hand, as if he was holding a cloud.</p><p>There were four words written on top. ‘True War Dragon Technique’.</p><p>Lu Ming frantically flipped its pages to read it in detail.</p><p>“So it seems that this isn’t the just Second Stage of the True War Dragon Technique, it’s the entire technique!” Lu Ming’s eyes sparkled.</p><p>As he continued flipping through the pages, his smile grew wider and wider.</p><p>Based on what was recorded, the True War Dragon Technique on the first platform was not technically a “First Stage”, but rather the introduction of the technique. It was mainly utilized to build a foundation, and open up the three divine meridians more easily.</p><p>From here on out was the real start of the True War Dragon Technique.</p><p>The technique was layered into nine Stages.</p><p>The dragon-shaped Essential Qi condensed from the True War Dragon Technique was more viscous compared to the Essential Qi from normal cultivation.</p><p>From what the records said, as long as the First Stage of the technique was achieved, the Essential Qi that was condensed would be twice as viscous as normal Qi.</p><p>Achieving the Second Stage would produce three times the viscosity. Based on that logic, if the Ninth Stage was achieved, the viscosity of the condensed Qi would be ten times that of normal Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. Ten times? What was this concept? It was comparing steel with deadwood. A single strike of steel would shatter the deadwood into million pieces.</p><p>It was horrifying. Truly, a Divine Level technique.</p><p>But the difficulties of cultivating it successfully could not be slighted as well.</p><p>Putting the Ninth Stage aside, the conditions of achieving the First Stage was to open up the three divine meridians, or successfully cultivating it would be impossible.</p><p>It was no wonder that the introduction to the True War Dragon Technique on the first platform stated that the three divine meridians had to be open for the user to cultivate the technique that followed.</p><p>That was merely the First Stage. A plethora of materials were required to assist in the cultivation of the Second Stage. They were all extremely rare materials, some which Lu Ming had never even heard of.</p><p>“I’ll deal with that when I get to it. To be able to cultivate the First Stage and achieve Essential Qi with twice the viscosity of normal Qi would be a terrifying feat in itself.</p><p>Excitement sparked in Lu Ming’s eyes. He carefully read the True War Dragon Technique once and picked up the other book.</p><p>The Lustrous Sword Technique was a Superior Yellow Level sword technique. If successfully cultivated, a sword would seem like a never ending stream of light that was as swift as lightning.</p><p>This was actually a Superior Yellow Level martial technique! Even the most precious martial technique of the Lu Family only was of Superior Yellow Level.</p><p>There was also a jade box, with the words ‘Spirit Soul Pill’ written on it.</p><p>The Spirit Soul Pill was a Third Level medicine pill that was worth at least tens of thousands of silver taels. There was a demand for it, but no supply, as it could rapidly advance one’s cultivation, making it extremely useful for people in the Master Realm, let alone the Warrior Realm.</p><p>“First, it was the Marrow-cleansing Pill, and now it’s the Spirit Soul Pill. They’re all useful for me.”</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed the joy in his head as his expression changed into one of contemplation.</p><p>He had a feeling that this was arranged by someone. How else could he explain how everything was useful to him?</p><p>How peculiar.</p><p>When he could not come to a conclusion, he shook his head. There was no point in thinking over it if he could not figure it out. Instead, he cast his gaze towards the third platform.</p><p>If the first and second platforms carried such treasures, what would he discover on the third platform?</p><p>There were still ninety-nine steps to the third platform. As expected, there was a force blocking Lu Ming’s way when he reached the ninety-ninth step.</p><p>Unlike what he thought, there were no chests on the third platform. It was empty, except for a stone stand in the middle of the platform. He could not make out its use.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s had a burning curiosity for the third platform, and the others that followed. However, there was nothing he could do as he was unable to ascend. Lu Ming shook his head and returned to the second platform, where he started circulating the True War Dragon Technique.</p><p>It was time for him to step into Warrior Realm.</p><p>Essential Qi was circulating in all twelve meridians. His one hundred and eight acupuncture points lit up as the surging Essential Qi finally gathered in his dantian.</p><p>Woosh… Woosh…</p><p>A cyclone suddenly formed in his dantian, spinning at a rapid speed. The Essential Qi in his meridians gravitated towards the cyclone.</p><p>The cycle started out big, but hazy like a mist. As time passed, the Qi cyclone shrunk in size as it became more dense. In the end, it was like a solid object that was clear and visible.</p><p>Woo…</p><p>A sound akin to dragons rang out. Inside Lu Ming’s body, his Essential Qi were like small miniature dragons that swam in the vortex and his meridians. Lu Ming’s aura had strengthened considerably.</p><p>He had stepped into Warrior Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming had finally entered Warrior Realm.</p><p>The True War Dragon Technique had been naturally cultivated to the First Stage.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and let out a long breath. The breath was like a pillar of gas, shooting out for meters before it dispersed.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stood up. He struck the air with his fists, which suddenly exploded like a bomb, ringing non-stop.</p><p>“Such a strong power. How strong am I right now? The Second Grade Warrior Realm? Or is it the Third Grade?”</p><p>Lu Ming had already surpassed human limits after he opened up the three divine meridians, but his Qi was twice as viscous compared to normal Qi after cultivating the First Stage of the True War Dragon Technique.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea how strong his explosive power now was.</p><p>Lu Ming then cast his gaze towards the Spirit Soul Pill.</p><p>“At the moment, my rate of cultivation has been too fast and needs consolidation, so it isn’t suitable for me to consume the Spirit Soul Pill. There’s still eighteen days before the House Meeting. It should be enough. I’ll wait until the House Meeting is right around the corner before I take the Spirit Soul Pill. I’ll have a better chance at the House Meeting that way.”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists. He was brimming with confidence as he felt the immense power within his body.</p><p>In the days that came, Lu Ming consolidated his cultivation as he cultivated several martial skills, especially the Lustrous Sword Technique.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed by.</p><p>There were only three days left before the House Meeting.</p><p>Within that time period, though Lu Ming’s blood meridian had not grown, its rate of absorbing any surrounding spirit energy had increased. Now, it could actually go toe to toe with a Third Level blood meridian.</p><p>Along with the True War Dragon Technique, if Lu Ming had cultivated normally, his absorption rate could be compared to a Fourth Level blood meridian.</p><p>In the span of half a month, not only had Lu Ming’s cultivation solidified, but it was also advancing at a stable pace.</p><p>He had already reached the top of First Grade Warrior Realm.</p><p>In terms of martial techniques, the Flame Dragon Fist was still on the Fourth Stage, the “Mastery of Technique” stage.</p><p>The farther one advanced in martial skills, the harder it would be to improve. There were people who were unable to advance to the “Mastery of Technique” stage for Inferior Yellow Level martial arts techniques.</p><p>However, the Dragon Serpent Steps had improved, advancing to the Fourth Stage, the “Mastery of Technique” stage.</p><p>The Lustrous Sword Technique, which was of Superior Yellow Level, was even harder to cultivate.</p><p>In half a month’s time, Lu Ming had only cultivated it to the Second Stage with the help of the chanting. It was a small accomplishment.</p><p>Lu Ming was seated on a stone stool in the center of the courtyard. He brewed a cup of tea, which he was leisurely sipping.</p><p>After cultivating for so long, Lu Ming wanted to relax a little before making a final push.</p><p>“Young Master! Young Master! I bear good news!”</p><p>The moment she finished her sentence, an adorable and pleasant maiden appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>It was Qiu Yue.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
