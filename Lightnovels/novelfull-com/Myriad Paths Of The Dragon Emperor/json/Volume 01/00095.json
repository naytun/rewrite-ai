There was not much of it, but it was fiery red and had a crystal-like feeling, like it was formed by melting fire Jade.</p><p>“Fire spirit milk, this is the fire spirit milk!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>There was indeed fire spirit milk here. No wonder the flame crystal grass could grow here.</p><p>The fire spirit milk was a rare treasure of heaven and earth. It could only be formed in places with extremely rich fire-type spiritual Qi, and it contained rich fire-type essence.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and with a wave of his hand, a Jade box and a Jade bottle appeared.</p><p>The jade box was made of ordinary white jade. Lu Ming had prepared it himself to store the spiritual herbs.</p><p>The Jade bottle was found in Zheng’s storage ring. It was made of fire Jade, and was perfect for storing the fire spiritual milk.</p><p>He took out a sword, carefully dug out the flame crystal grass, and placed it into a Jade box.</p><p>Then, he circulated his true Qi and sucked the fire spirit milk into the Jade bottle.</p><p>“It’s quite a lot, at least two catties.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He had thought that it would be a great opportunity to have one catty. He did not expect to have two catties.</p><p>“If I refine all of this fire spirit milk, how strong will my physical body be? At the very least, I can cultivate to upper rank-1, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and kept the things. He did not stop and went up along the stone wall.</p><p>It was a smooth journey and he did not encounter any threats. Very soon, Lu Ming walked out of the central area and returned to the outer area.</p><p>After returning to the outer area, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine directly.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, Lu Ming took out the flaming Vajra art and studied it in detail. Then, he took out the Jade bottle that contained the fire spirit milk.</p><p>“Now, use the fire spirit milk to practice the raging flame Vajra art.”</p><p>Lu Ming opened the bottle and pondered for a moment. Then, he took a small sip.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He swallowed a small mouthful of the fire spirit milk and it immediately erupted like a volcano. It emitted a scorching aura and violent energy that filled Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a fireball.</p><p>“Nest, the energy of this fire spirit milk is too terrifying. It has exceeded my imagination. It’s so hot and so painful!”</p><p>The energy of the fire spirit milk was extremely hot, burning Lu Ming’s muscles, bones, and bones.</p><p>In this situation, it was as if Lu Ming was being roasted in a raging fire. One could imagine the pain.</p><p>I have to endure it. The reason why it hurts so much is because my body is too weak. I’ve never cultivated the path of body refinement before. I’ve only tempered it slowly with my true Qi. After the first time, my body has improved, and the next time, it won’t hurt so much.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred. He gritted his teeth and activated the flaming Vajra art. He started to absorb and refine this scorching energy.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>It was as if his body was a piece of iron that was being burned and forged in the raging flames. Lu Ming could even hear the sound of his body burning.</p><p>This process lasted for a full two hours before the fire spirit milk’s energy was completely refined.</p><p>At this moment, the pain completely disappeared, and an extremely comfortable feeling spread throughout his body.</p><p>my physical strength has indeed improved a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming felt the changes in his body carefully.</p><p>He discovered that although his body didn’t become much stronger, his muscles were much tougher, and his entire body was filled with strength.</p><p>His blood and Qi surged in his veins, full of vitality. His body’s functions were stronger than before.</p><p>“The raging inferno Vajra art and the fire spirit milk are a perfect match. I only refined a small mouthful of it, and it has such an improvement. Although I haven’t reached the first grade physical body, I believe that I will soon reach it if this continues.”</p><p>“Now, continue!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took a small mouthful of fire spirit milk and continued to cultivate the raging flames Vajra Arts.</p><p>Just like before, when the fire spirit milk entered his body, it exploded with an intense fire attribute essence that was incomparably scorching.</p><p>“I wonder if the spirit devouring bloodline is useful for the fire spirit milk?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly had an idea.</p><p>Even before his bloodline had completely regrown, he was already able to quickly refine the power of elixirs.</p><p>Then, could he quickly refine the power of the fire spirit milk now?</p><p>He would know once he tried.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming controlled his Blood Meridian and a powerful devouring force was produced at his spine.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Immediately, the fire spirit milk’s energy in his body was completely absorbed by his bloodline.</p><p>Not long after, waves of gentler and purer energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body. He circulated the flaming Vajra Arts and absorbed all the energy into his body to improve his physical strength.</p><p>It was different from devouring blood essence. When devouring blood essence, the blood Meridian would absorb half of the energy and use it to strengthen itself. Only half of the essence would flow into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The fire spirit milk was different. All the energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Under the circulation of the flaming Vajra Arts, the strength of Lu Ming’s body was rapidly increasing.</p><p>In just about ten minutes, that small mouthful of fire spirit milk was completely refined, and he felt that his body had become stronger again.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t feel any pain at all.</p><p>“If I had known earlier, I would have controlled my bloodline from the first bite. I wouldn’t have to suffer so much!”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of regret.</p><p>After resting for a while, he continued to refine the fire transforming spiritual milk.</p><p>A day later, about two to three taels of fire spirit milk had been refined. Lu Ming’s physical body had broken through in one fell swoop and reached the first-grade physical body, reaching the initial success of the first-grade physical body.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique. The Dragon-shaped essential Qi was like the water of a River, surging in Lu Ming’s meridians without restraint.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With genuine Qi attached to his fist, he punched out. His fist passed through the air, creating a Sonic Boom. A transparent air wave rushed out.</p><p>“Strong, my body’s quality is more than ten times stronger than before. Whether it’s my muscles, bones, meridians, or internal organs, they’ve all been strengthened by many times.”</p><p>The last time he was besieged by Yao Tianyu and his men, he was severely injured and took seven to eight days to recover. But now, Lu Ming believed that he would be fully recovered in three days.</p><p>This was the benefit of having a strong body.</p><p>Moreover, the combination of his physical body and Lu Ming’s cultivation base had increased his combat strength by a large margin.</p><p>Of course, if Lu Ming did not use his essential Qi or martial arts techniques, a third grade warrior would be able to defeat him easily if he fought with his physical body.</p><p>The path of the physical body was not used as the main battle, but to support martial arts.</p><p>I can’t just focus on refining the fire spirit milk to improve my physical body. Otherwise, I won’t be able to adapt to it all at once. I should go out and cultivate my spear Arts now to get my physical body and martial arts in sync. I’ll continue to cultivate my physical body after my physical body, true Qi, and martial arts have perfectly integrated.</p><p>Lu Ming then left the Supreme shrine and returned to the central area to cultivate the fire controlling spear technique.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming cultivated his spear technique for a few days and refined some fire spiritual milk.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s spear technique and physical body were improving rapidly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 20 days had passed.</p><p>On the twenty-third day, Lu Ming had refined the two catties of fire spirit milk. His physical body was improving at a rapid pace.</p><p>He advanced from upper first-grade to complete first-grade and reached lower second-grade.</p><p>This had already surpassed the previous Zheng.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
