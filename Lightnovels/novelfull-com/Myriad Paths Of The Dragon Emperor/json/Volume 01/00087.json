After walking for about ten miles, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>This was because a fierce tiger with red flames all over its body had appeared in front of him.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger was a class 8 second level demonic beast. It was a fire-element demonic beast and usually lived in places with rich fire-element spiritual Qi.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger suddenly roared and opened its mouth. A pillar of fire spewed out of its mouth and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed and he took out his fire-patterned gun.</p><p>“Fire gun art-broken armor!”</p><p>With a thrust of the spear, the spinning cutting force burst out and destroyed the pillar of fire spat out by the Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged at the Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger and smashed his spear at it.</p><p>“Fire gun art-mountain crash!”</p><p>The long spear pressed down, emitting a violent whistling sound. The Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger seemed to sense danger. The fiery red fur on its body stood on end, and on its fur, there were scorching flames.</p><p>These flames condensed into a huge fireball in the air and shot towards the fire-patterned spear, trying to block the attack.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. The fire pattern spear was unstoppable. With a slight shake, the fireball collapsed, and the fire pattern spear continued to smash down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear hit the Scarlet-flame demonic Tiger’s head, making a cracking sound. The Scarlet-flame demonic Tiger’s forehead caved in.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demonic Tiger’s huge body rolled back dozens of meters before it stopped. It was no longer breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and controlled his Blood Meridian to suck out the Scarlet Flame demonic tiger’s blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming would not miss the chance to obtain the blood essence of an eighth grade second level demonic beast. In the mystical sword sect, it cost 800 contribution points.</p><p>Circulating his spirit devouring bloodline, it did not take long for him to devour and refine the Scarlet Flame demon tiger’s blood essence. Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved once again, but he was still a little lacking to break through to the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>“This place is rich in flame Qi, I’ll cultivate the fire lance technique here.”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming’s mind sank into the fire gun control art and he began to cultivate.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>Shadows of the spear were everywhere, and the energy was surging. Lu Ming felt that his cultivation was extremely smooth. There was no obstruction when he circulated the spear technique. It was as if he was one with the surrounding environment.</p><p>As expected, the environment had a great influence on the cultivation of battle techniques.</p><p>“Smooth, it’s too smooth!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was immersed in this feeling.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after six hours of cultivation.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming panted heavily. Cultivating here required him to circulate his essential Qi to protect his body at all times. He also had to observe his surroundings to see if there was any magma or flames rushing out. It was very taxing on his essential Qi and mind.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>He had only cultivated for six hours and Lu Ming could feel that he had made great progress in the fire gun art.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately retreated to the outer area to recover his essential Qi.</p><p>After his essential Qi had recovered, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine again. With the help of the chanting, he continued to comprehend the feeling of cultivating in the central region.</p><p>Sure enough, with the chanting, the feeling of cultivation just now became clearer, and his understanding of the fire gun art was one step closer.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming entered the central region again to cultivate the firearms Control art.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming cultivated in the central area. When his essential Qi was exhausted, he returned to the outer area to recover. Then, he combined it with the chanting of Sutras to comprehend the fire gun art.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the fire gun control art was rapidly improving.</p><p>In just half a month, Lu Ming’s fire gun controlling art had a breakthrough and entered the second level, which was a small success.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had killed no less than ten fire-attribute demonic beasts in the past half a month. Five of them were at the eighth grade of second level, and one was even at the ninth grade of second level.</p><p>The others were all below eighth grade second level.</p><p>After devouring and refining the demonic beasts ‘blood essence, coupled with half a month’s hard work, Lu Ming’s cultivation finally broke through again, reaching the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>Such a cultivation base was already considered extremely high among the bronze disciples of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Once again, Lu Ming exhausted his essential Qi and retreated to the outer area. He meditated in a secluded pile of rocks to recover.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s essential Qi had recovered by about half, he suddenly heard a commotion not far away.</p><p>“No, why did you catch me? I’m just an ordinary person without any cultivation. I can’t help you.”</p><p>“I’m only at third grade warrior realm, so I can’t help you. Please let me go.”</p><p>……</p><p>Sounds of begging for mercy could be heard.</p><p>“Shut up, what’s with all the noise? If I say you can help, then you can help. It’s your eight lifetimes of good fortune to be able to help the disciples of my ten directions Sword School.”</p><p>A cold shout rang out. From the voice, it was a young man.</p><p>young heroes of the ten direction Sword School, if I can help you, I will definitely help. But you want us to enter the central region, and even get close to the inner region. It’s very dangerous there. With my cultivation, if I’m not careful, I will be burned to death. Please, young heroes, spare me.</p><p>Some people begged for mercy.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Immediately, the sound of a slap rang out.</p><p>The young voice continued,”what are you talking about? what did I call you for?” What are you doing? If you continue to talk nonsense, I’ll cut you into pieces.”</p><p>The other side of the phone calmed down.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of something breaking through the air rang out, and a figure appeared on the pile of rubble.</p><p>It was a young man who was about seventeen or eighteen years old. He saw Lu Ming at a glance.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother, there’s one more person here.”</p><p>The young man laughed and looked at Lu Ming.”You really know how to hide, but do you think that hiding here is useful? Hurry up and come out and help us scout the way to the central region.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He stopped the essential Qi that he had recovered halfway and stood up.</p><p>“Kid, hurry up and come out. Don’t dawdle, I don’t have time to waste with you.”</p><p>As the young man spoke, he swiped his claw at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>It was obvious that he wanted to grab Lu Ming and throw him out like a chicken. However, he was disappointed.</p><p>Not only was he disappointed, but he was also shocked.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had also extended a hand and clawed at him. He was faster and more accurate than him as he grabbed his wrist.</p><p>The strong force penetrated the bones of the young man’s wrist, and the heart-piercing pain made the young man scream.</p><p>“Argh! Little bastard, you dare to hurt me? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The young man’s other hand was about to slap Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and his essential Qi burst out. He swung the arm that was holding the young man’s wrist. The young man’s arm made a ‘Kacha Kacha’ sound and the bones in one of his arms broke into several pieces. He let out a blood-curdling scream and flew more than ten meters away, falling heavily on the ground.</p><p>“Argh! “Ah!” You little bastard, you’re dead. You dare to hit me? do you know who I am?”</p><p>The young man struggled to get up, hugging his arms and crying out in a heart-wrenching voice.</p><p>“Aren’t you just a disciple of the ten direction Sword School? Is it that amazing?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
