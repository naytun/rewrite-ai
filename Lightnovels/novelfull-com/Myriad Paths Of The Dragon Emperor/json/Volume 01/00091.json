He could roughly guess what had happened when he saw the charred bodies.</p><p>In his heart, a cold and sharp killing intent burst out.</p><p>Although Warriors had great power, they had their own rules and pride. Ordinary Warriors would not kill ordinary people.</p><p>However, these disciples of the ten directions Sword School had already lost their bottom line. In order to achieve their goals, they would do anything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent had never been so strong.</p><p>Sensing the killing intent from Lu Ming, the eyes of the disciples from the omnidirectional sword sect narrowed.</p><p>Zheng frowned.</p><p>He remembered that he had sent nine people in that direction, but not only had no one come, but an unfamiliar teenager had also come.</p><p>Something was wrong! Zheng’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming took one step at a time. It seemed slow but he was actually very fast. In a few breaths, he was in front of the disciple from the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>“Kid, how did you get here? And where are the disciples of my ten directions Sword School? Did you see it?”</p><p>A disciple of the ten directions Sword School asked loudly.</p><p>“I did, but they’re all dead.”</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently.</p><p>The twenty or so disciples of the ten directions Sword School all had a change in expression. Someone shouted, ” “Tell me, how did you die?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly. With a wave of his hand, the fire pattern spear appeared. A powerful aura burst out.”Of course I killed them. Now, I’ll send you down to accompany them.”</p><p>“You killed him? Brat, you’re quite bold.”</p><p>little bastard, how dare you kill the disciples of my ten directions Sword School? you’re dead. Not only you, but your family will also be dead.</p><p>“Tell me, what method did you use to sneak attack?”</p><p>you still want to kill us? you’re overestimating yourself. I’ll kill you.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused a commotion. A burly young man strode out with a huge sword in his hand and slashed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>If this sword hit, it would definitely split Lu Ming into two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A bolt of lightning flashed and the burly young man’s body suddenly stiffened.</p><p>With a clang, his sword fell to the ground. Then, he clenched his throat with both hands. His eyes were wide open like a dead fish, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>There was a bloody hole in his throat, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>lightning pursuit ” of the ” fire gun art ” was the fastest move in the ” fire gun art “.</p><p>The surrounding disciples of the omnidirectional sword sect did not even see how Lu Ming had attacked.</p><p>“Those who kill will always be killed. If you want to kill me, then be prepared to be killed.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>The burly young man fell to the ground and struggled a few times before he stopped breathing.</p><p>“Good kill!”</p><p>More than ten stone hunters shouted in their hearts. Although they did not dare to shout it out, they were very happy in their hearts.</p><p>Zheng’s eyes narrowed. what a fast speed! Everyone, let’s attack together and kill him!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>At once, more than a dozen disciples from the omnidirectional Sword School roared and leaped high into the air, slashing out sharp sword Qi at Lu Ming from the front.</p><p>The weakest of the disciples was at the sixth grade master realm, while the strongest was at the eighth grade master realm.</p><p>The combined power of the dozen of them was extremely terrifying. Even a ninth grade master realm expert would be chopped to death by the swords.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not move at all. He did not even blink.</p><p>“Fire gun art-fire dance!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming held the end of the spear in his hand. The long spear swayed and pierced forward.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The sound of the long spear vibrating could be heard. Then, fiery red flames suddenly appeared in the sky. These flames were scarlet red, poignant, and beautiful. They were like flowers of flames, and they also seemed to be dancing.</p><p>When the flower of flames bloomed, the scene suddenly rang out with a series of miserable screams.</p><p>The ten or so disciples of the ten directions sword sect retreated in unison. Fresh blood scattered in the air, and it was extremely tragic.</p><p>There was a bloody hole in each of the ten or so disciples of the ten directions Sword School, either in their throats or hearts.</p><p>In one move, thirteen disciples of the ten directions Sword School were killed!</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop at all. He strode forward and swept his long spear horizontally.</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Bang Bang …</p><p>A series of bone-cracking sounds were heard, and the eight young men from the ten directions Sword School were sent flying far away.</p><p>He fell to the ground and stopped breathing.</p><p>It was a complete sweep.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s current combat strength.</p><p>With his black grade low level martial skill [ fire gun Scripture ] cultivated to the second stage and his cultivation breaking through to the early eighth grade master realm, his battle prowess had increased to a terrifying level.</p><p>There were only three disciples from the ten direction Sword School left.</p><p>One was Zheng, and the other was a ninth grade master realm expert.</p><p>The other one was the flat-nosed young man. As he was standing close to the stone hunters, Lu Ming’s attack did not affect him.</p><p>At this moment, the flat-nosed young man’s expression changed drastically, and his legs and stomach trembled.</p><p>Zheng’s expression also became extremely grave.</p><p>your combat power is very strong, but you’ve killed so many of our ten directions Sword school’s disciples. From now on, no one will be able to save you, no matter whether you’re in heaven or in hell.</p><p>Zheng’s voice was cold.</p><p>“As long as I kill all of you, who will know that I did it?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently.</p><p>“Hahaha, you want to kill me? I admit that you’re very strong, and I’m not sure if I can kill you. But you want to kill me? I’ll let you know how laughable your words are!”</p><p>Zheng Qian pointed his sword at Lu Ming, and a powerful red sword aura flickered.</p><p>“Brother Zhao, let’s kill him together.”</p><p>die! Zheng Jiao suddenly shouted. He leaped up and slashed his sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>The combat sword cut through the air, producing an ear-piercing Sonic Boom.</p><p>At the same time, on the other side, the ninth grade master realm disciple from the omnipresent Sword School also burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted it upwards.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The spear and the two swords clashed, causing a violent vibration.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure swayed slightly and he took three steps back.</p><p>Zheng was also thrown back a few meters, landing on the ground.</p><p>As for the ninth grade master realm young man, he was thrown back a dozen meters and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This Zheng Zha is so powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Although they had only exchanged one move, Lu Ming could sense that the power that Zheng Qian’s combat sword was spreading out was extremely powerful. It was like a raging wave that was continuous.</p><p>The other ninth grade master realm young man was trash compared to him.</p><p>He was definitely not weaker than he tie.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming retreated was basically because of Zheng Zheng.</p><p>At this moment, Zheng was also extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had also exceeded his expectations. He was not weaker than him. In fact, he was even stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There was nothing much to say. The two sides were already mortal enemies, and it would only end when one side fell. The two sides fought again.</p><p>The two of them erupted with their bloodlines.</p><p>This time, Zheng was the main attacker, while the other ninth grade master realm youth sneaked an attack from the side.</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was somewhat passive.</p><p>As for the flat-nosed youngster, he couldn’t do anything at all. He could only watch anxiously from the side.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
