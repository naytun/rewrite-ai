Nobody will be taking Lu Ming away today!” Feng Wu said resolutely. Her announcement shocked everyone around her.</p><p>...</p><p>The faces of the two youths from the Duanmu Family darkened. “Feng Wu, do you really want to go against the Duanmu Family? Our rage isn’t something that you can handle.”</p><p>“Junior Sister Feng Wu, it isn’t sensible to cross the Duanmu Family and the Wei Brothers just for the mere Lu Ming. I think we should keep our hands to ourselves!” Yuan Chong quickly chimed in from the side.</p><p>“Silence! Anyone who wants to go for Lu Ming will have to go through my blade first!”</p><p>Clink!</p><p>A swathe of razor-sharp Sword Qi shot out from Feng Wu’s sword as she unsheathed her blade. Immediately, a boulder that was around the size of a man was sliced in half.</p><p>She emanated the aura of Master Realm.</p><p>The faces of Wei Ziming, Wei Ziyou, and the two youths from the Duanmu Family, as well as Yuan Chong, darkened.</p><p>Yuan Chong, in particular, was greatly affected. He was gritting his teeth together.</p><p>The eyes of Wei Ziyou and the two Duanmu Family members lit up. While Lu Ming was an easy target for them, it would be difficult to deal with Feng Wu.</p><p>Although Wei Ziyou had cultivated to the First Grade Master Realm, the two youths from the Duanmu Family were only on the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm, so the two youths from the Duanmu Family ultimately decided to step down.</p><p>“Feng Wu, do you really think that you’ll be able to keep Lu Ming safe? Let’s see how you handle yourself when my family sends even stronger people over! Hmph!” Wei Ziyou sneered. With a twist of his body, he retreated together with Wei Ziming.</p><p>1</p><p>“Rest assured, Lu Ming. The Midnight Hills stretches on for over 500 kilometers. The Duanmu Family won’t be able to find us as long as we’re careful,” Feng Wu said as she walked up beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you very much!” Lu Ming smiled feebly.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to wriggle out of the crisis even without Feng Wu.</p><p>He was able to travel over three meters in a single step using the Dragon Serpent Steps. He believed that even an ace in First Grade Master Realm would not be able to catch up.</p><p>1</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still thankful that Feng Wu stood firmly on his side despite the current situation.</p><p>“There’s no need to be courteous with me. Let’s continue the journey!” Feng Wu said as she turned around. She shot a glare at Yuan Chong and walked forwards with large strides.</p><p>Wu Feng then proceeded to take the lead. She changed directions after a certain distance to stop the Duanmu Family and Wei Ziming from catching up.</p><p>They had traveled over 50 kilometers in the woods by the evening.</p><p>During their journey, they encountered a few demonic beasts that had several metal plates with points on them, and they successfully obtained a few pieces of metal tablets.</p><p>The metal tablets were light and thin. Two of the tables were etched with the number “1” on top, while the other had the number “2” etched on it. They had two plates worth a point, and another worth two.</p><p>The night quickly arrived. They started a fire and caught a demonic beast to cook as food.</p><p>The Midnight Hills was even more precarious during the night. The demonic beasts that appeared were even more ferocious, so they decided to rest for the night and continue the search for metal tablets during the day.</p><p>After they finished their meals and extinguished the fire, they found a secluded corner and meditated while resting respectively.</p><p>The night passed without a single word being uttered. On the second day, they continued their search for demonic beasts with metal tablets on them.</p><p>However, within the Midnight Hills’ territory which spanned over 500 kilometers, there were countless demonic beasts while there were only around 7,000 demonic beasts that held metal tablets. It was hard to find them within the vast confines of the forest.</p><p>Three days soon passed just like that.</p><p>In those three days, the five of them had managed to find six tablets worth one point and three tablets worth two points. The points totaled to twelve, which was only enough for one person to pass.</p><p>As the sky was nearly plunged into darkness on the third day, they found a Silent Shadow Wolf. A metal tablet with the number “10” hung on the neck of the wolf.</p><p>“It’s a tablet worth ten points! Get it.” Wu Feng joyfully gave pursuit in a flash.</p><p>The Silent Shadow Wolf was a First Grade Second Level demonic beast.</p><p>A normal demonic beast that was in First Grade Second Level would usually hold five points, while ten points were reserved for demonic beasts on the Second Grade – or even the Third Grade – of the Second Level. It was a rare sight for a metal tablet worth ten points to be on a demonic beast of First Grade Second Level, so they definitely would not make light of the opportunity.</p><p>“Let’s chase after it together!” Feng Wu yelled behind her.</p><p>Zhou Hao and Zhou Xu, who were behind her, also rapidly darted to the front.</p><p>However, the Silent Shadow Wolf boasted great speed, thus Wu Feng was unable to catch up in a short time. In the mere span of a few breaths, Wu Feng and the Silent Shadow Wolf were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Lu Ming started to use his technique to catch up, but a figure flitted across and blocked his path. It was Yuan Chong.</p><p>“Yuan Chong, are you planning to make a move on me?” Lu Ming furrowed his brows.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you piece of trash! Wu Feng is truly a dumb b*tch for taking you under her wing, but I, Yuan Chong, have no intention of being involved with you!”</p><p>A strong surge of Qi enveloped Lu Ming as Yuan Chong pointed his sword at him.</p><p>“Yuan Chong, you should be 17 this year, aren’t you?” Lu Ming suddenly asked.</p><p>“That’s right! So what?” Yuan Chong replied.</p><p>“You’re still in the First Grade Master Realm at the age of 17, so I guess that makes you worse than trash. I’ll be able to surpass you in two months!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s hilarious! Do you think you’ll be able to beat me in two months, a mere piece of trash in Sixth Grade Warrior Realm like you? You’re making me laugh! But too bad you won’t get the chance.” Yuan Chong flashed a chilling smile.</p><p>At that moment, the silence in the woods around them was interrupted as two figures appeared. They were the two youths from the Duanmu Family before.</p><p>“I guess you’re still smart, Yuan Chong. Thanks for your cooperation. You can go now,” one of the youths from the Duanmu Family said.</p><p>1</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming! Just accept that this is your fate!” Yuan Chong burst into laughter. He flitted towards the direction of Wu Feng and the Silent Shadow Wolf in a flash.</p><p>“Lu Ming, would you like to send yourself to the afterlife, or do you need our help?” one of the youths from the Duanmu Family mocked as they stared at Lu Ming after Yuan Chong left. They looked as if they already had him cornered.</p><p>“With just the two of you? The Duanmu Family really does look down on me!” Lu Ming sighed. Suddenly, he stomped his foot on the ground before charging towards the two youths from the Duanmu Family like a flash of lightning.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>In the midst of charging, a blade of light flashed towards one of the youths with the intent to maim.</p><p>Offense was the best defense!</p><p>Now that they were archenemies, Lu Ming would no longer be gentle.</p><p>The two youths from the Duanmu Family were startled. They never expected Lu Ming to be so daring. As someone in Sixth Grade Warrior Realm, he was facing two people in the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm, and had actually made the first move.</p><p>Furthermore, his strike was sharp, ruthless, and concise.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The duo hastily stepped back.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>Despite their efforts, Lu Ming’s blade still sliced across one of their chests. The slash went as deep as the bone, causing blood to immediately flow out.</p><p>‘That’s a pity. Just a little more and I would’ve been able to slice apart his heart. Ninth Grade Warrior Realm is certainly strong!’ Lu Ming sighed as he consoled himself.</p><p>He had no problems massacring a martial artist in Eighth Grade Warrior Realm with his current combat power. On the other hand, while he had no problems with battling against someone in the Ninth Grade Warrior Realm, it was hard for him to kill one.</p><p>“You dare to hurt me, Lu Ming? I’ll tear you into a thousand pieces!” the youth that was injured by Li Ming roared at the top of his voice. He was sweating from the fear of what just transpired. Meanwhile, the other youth was darting towards Lu Ming at a rapid pace.</p><p>“Then, let’s duke it out.” Lu Ming charged ahead as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
