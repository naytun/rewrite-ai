He simply could not allow Lu Ming to throw the first place away so rashly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and told Xie Kuang, “Don’t worry, Elder Xie, just a mere Duanmu Disciple with slightly longer cultivation time, that’s all. So what?”</p><p>He then turned to Duanmu Jin and confirmed, “I accept the challenge, Duanmu Jin.”</p><p>“Good!” Duanmu Jin was flooded with euphoria when he saw how Lu Ming accepted his challenge. He cupped his fists towards the Silver-robed Elder once more and said, “Elder Wang, Lu Ming himself said he’ll do it. Please allow it.”</p><p>Elder Wang nodded and replied, “Alright, it’ll be done according to your request then.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder Wang!” Duanmu Jin could barely contain his delight. He turned to Duanmu Tao and stated, “Listen carefully now, Duanmu Tao. Lu Ming’s the Apprentice Champion nominee. He’s highly talented, so you’ve gotta just try your best later, understand?”</p><p>“Got it. Don’t worry, Elder Jin.” A sinister smile hung on Duanmu Tao’s face as he turned to Lu Ming. “You still have time to just surrender now, Lu Ming. Otherwise, when the match starts, watch out, or you’re gonna get hurt later. Don’t blame me for not giving you a heads-up.”</p><p>Duanmu Jin retreated for a good ten meters and told Duanmu Tao, “Don’t hold back. The Mystical Sword Sect’s Apprentice Champion should be capable and know his stuff well. He shouldn’t be a piece of trash that only relies on luck.”</p><p>“Your time is up.” With a menacing smile on his face, Duanmu Tao moved unexpectedly. He unsheathed his sword and hacked it towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p><p>In a flick, nine beams of sword light that resembled plum blossoms bloomed from the body of his sword, engulfing Lu Ming completely.</p><p>“This is the Heavenly Plum-Blossom Sword Technique, a Superior Yellow Level martial arts technique. After years of painstaking training and cultivation, Duanmu Tao’s finally reached the Fourth Stage,” the Azure Dragon Hall guidance elder commented with a sparkle in his eyes.</p><p>“Not bad, even though Duanmu Tao’s cultivation is merely average, he has pretty good perception towards martial arts technique. He’s considerably talented to be able to cultivate a Superior Yellow Level martial arts technique to the stage he’s at in just a few years. What a clever plan it is for Duanmu Jin to send Duanmu Tao out to fight Lu Ming! I’m afraid no one in this batch of new apprentices is a match for Duanmu Tao,” the Onyx Tortoise Hall guidance elder added.</p><p>“Wretch!” Xie Kuang clamped his fists tightly as worry shone in his eyes.</p><p>“Heh heh!” Duanmu Jin smirked.</p><p>At the same time, a similar smirk was seen hanging on Lu Ming’s face as well. He held his ground.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A sword light as fast as lightning burst forth.</p><p>It all happened too fast! In an instant, the lightning-like sword light reached its target first even though it was released later. As the cold sword tip neared Duanmu Tao’s face, a feeling of dread crept up from deep within his heart.</p><p>Retreat!</p><p>Without hesitation, Duanmu Tao retreated in a frenzy. Whatever patterned sword light he had going disappeared immediately without a trace.</p><p>The smile froze on Duanmu Jin’s face.</p><p>“What a swift sword! This is also a Superior Yellow Level sword technique,” the Azure Dragon Hall guidance elder blurted out as his expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right. This is the Lustrous Sword Technique, a Superior Yellow Level sword technique. Lu Ming’s at least at the Fourth or Fifth stage, I reckon,” the Onyx Tortoise Hall guidance elder said as an odd gleam flitted through his eyes.</p><p>1</p><p>Xie Kuang was ecstatic. He did not expect Lu Ming to have such amazing martial arts attainment since he was just a new apprentice.</p><p>“Is this the martial arts technique you’ve trained painstakingly for a few years, Duanmu Tao? Is this all you’ve got? What a disgrace.” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Damn it! Here’s one more move!” Duanmu Tao roared. His figure dazzled into several phantom images that attacked Lu Ming simultaneously while a tempest of Sword Qi exploded from his body of his sword.</p><p>Duanmu Tao continuously slashed about seven or eight Sword Qis out, all of it aimed at Lu Ming. ‘So what if your sword’s swift?’ He would suppress Lu Ming with formidable Essential Qi.</p><p>“I’m done playing games with you,” Lu Ming muttered. His long sword then slashed abruptly.</p><p>Zing!</p><p>A beam of Sword Qi swept across the area. It was a lot sharper than Duanmu Tao’s Sword Qi.</p><p>After Lu Ming broke through to the Third Grade Master Realm, the mass of his Essential Qi was already above Duanmu Tao’s.</p><p>Duanmu Tao’s Sword Qi was severed in several puffs. Immediately after that, Lu Ming threw a punch out with his left hand.</p><p>The Flame Dragon Fist.</p><p>The blow landed right on Duanmu Tao’s dantian.</p><p>Duanmu Tao cried out in pain as his body flew backward from impact and landed heavily on the ground. His face paled as he vomited copious amounts of blood.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Pin-drop silence swept across the entire area.</p><p>Two moves. All Lu Ming took to defeat Duanmu Tao were two moves. It was a complete victory. Was this even a new apprentice’s fighting ability?</p><p>“My Qi cyclone, my cultivation! Lu Ming, did you just destroy my cultivation?” Duanmu Tao let out a shrill cry.</p><p>The punch that Lu Ming delivered was so powerful that it completely destroyed the Qi cyclone in Duanmu Tao’s dantian.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>“Lu Ming!” The cold, murderous intent that exploded from Duanmu Jin was directed straight at Lu Ming.</p><p>In a stride, Xie Kuang stepped in and blocked Duanmu Jin in his path.</p><p>“Piss off, Xie Kuang! I’ll destroy that little b*stard. How could he land such a heavy blow in a friendly match? He has such a bad character and should be killed!” Duanmu Jin yelled.</p><p>“Duanmu Jin, Duanmu Tao’s words were ‘when the match starts, watch out, or you’re gonna get hurt later’. I thought I did pretty well by restraining myself and sparing his life, but rather than thanking me, you accuse me of having a bad character. Instead of me, I think the person with a bad character is you!” Lu Ming said in a loud voice.</p><p>“Go to hell, little b*stard!” Duanmu Jin had enough. His face was a bright red as he failed to stifle his rage.</p><p>“That’s enough.” The Silver-robed Elder waved and a gust of energy poured out, forcing Xie Kuang and Duanmu Jin to stagger backward.</p><p>“You’ve gotta give Duanmu Tao justice, please, Elder Wang!” Duanmu Jin shrieked.</p><p>Elder Wang frowned, “Enough, Duanmu Jin. Nothing is guaranteed when a duel happens. Injuries are inevitable. Stop making a big fuss.”</p><p>To ensure fairness, the Silver-robed Elders had been sent directly by the sect leader to oversee the test. They did not belong to any hall, so they would not take sides.</p><p>Elder Wang was joyful when he witnessed Lu Ming’s capabilities and potential. After all, it meant that there was another genius in the Mystical Sword Sect. He was also annoyed at Duanmu Jin for trying to kill Lu Ming for his personal agenda.</p><p>“The match has proven Lu Ming’s capabilities, and since most people are out from the Midnight Hills, I declare that first place belongs to Lu Ming,” Elder Wang wasted no time as he announced.</p><p>“Damn it!” Duanmu Jin was boiling with rage. He knew he could not make Lu Ming pay that day.</p><p>‘I’ll see how cocky you can continue to be, Lu Ming! People who go against the Duanmu Family never end up in a good place,’ he cursed in his heart.</p><p>Not very far away, Xie Hong, Huang Yu, and the rest looked at Lu Ming, perplexed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s capabilities were beyond their expectation. They were so sure that Duanmu Jue had died by his hand.</p><p>They were secretly glad that they did not go after Lu Ming in the Midnight Hills, or else, they would have been dead.</p><p>“30 spiritual crystals. Pay up, Duanmu Jin,” Xie Kuang snickered coldly as he marched towards Duanmu Jin.</p><p>Clack, clack, clack…</p><p>Duanmu Jin gritted his teeth so tightly that they rubbed against each other noisily. He could not weasel out, not with everyone watching, so he painfully passed 30 spiritual crystals to Xie Kuang.</p><p>Xie Kuang laughed in satisfaction.</p><p>The time was up for Elder Wang to announce the placings.</p><p>“Huang Yu is in second place, and Xie Hong in third.”</p><p>The names and placings were announced individually.</p><p>With 131 points, Feng Wu was placed in 22nd place.</p><p>Once the announcement was done, Elder Wang continued with a wave, “Now, this marks the end of the new apprentice test. Once you get back to the sect, those with rewards can claim them when you get your identity jade pieces done. You are dismissed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
