If I don’t cripple you today, I’ll change my surname to yours.”</p><p>A dark-skinned young man walked out.</p><p>He had a majestic figure with bulging muscles like black iron. His eyes were cold as he glared at Lu Ming with a murderous look.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He suddenly leaped from the top of the stairs. While he was in the air, his body glowed with blood-red light and a huge black bear appeared. There were two blood-red chakras on the black bear.</p><p>With his fourth grade master realm cultivation and the black bear bloodline, the burly young man’s aura grew even stronger. Like a mountain, he pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This burly young man was several times stronger than the big-mouthed young man from before.</p><p>Above, Liu Wei and the rest sneered. They believed that the burly young man would definitely be able to make Lu Ming suffer a great loss.</p><p>How strong could a new disciple be?</p><p>However, the next moment, the smiles on their faces froze.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>It was still a loud slap.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the strong young man with an imposing manner fly back at a speed faster than when he had pounced forward.</p><p>His face was deformed, and blood mixed with teeth flew everywhere. His body fell heavily to the ground, and with a scream, he followed in the footsteps of the big-mouthed young man and fainted.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Liu Wei and the other members of the Starmoon Alliance could not help but gasp.</p><p>No matter how arrogant they were, they could tell that Lu Ming was an expert.</p><p>However, since when was there such a powerful master among the new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples?</p><p>Could it be?</p><p>Liu Wei’s expression changed. He slowly stood up from his chair and asked, ” “Speak, Who are you?”</p><p>senior brother Lu Ming, well done!</p><p>At that moment, the skinny youth shouted in excitement.</p><p>Although the new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples had seen Lu Ming earlier, everything had happened so quickly that they did not even have the time to call out his name.</p><p>“Lu Ming? The newcomer King, Lu Ming?”</p><p>On the steps, the expressions of the other members of the star Moon Alliance changed slightly.</p><p>To some people, the newcomer King still had some weight, especially two months ago when Lu Ming had defeated Ning Feng.</p><p>So it was him?</p><p>Not far away, the other senior disciples of the four courtyards suddenly understood.</p><p>It was no wonder that among this year’s newcomers, only Lu Ming had the ability and the guts to send two members of the star and moon Alliance flying in front of the door.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really you? But let me tell you, even though you’re the newcomer King, you’re still too young to cause trouble in the Starmoon Alliance.”</p><p>Liu Wei’s eyes flashed as he said coldly.</p><p>A cold smile hung on the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth. Step by step, he ascended the steps and walked towards Liu Wei and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? Do you really dare to go against the star Moon Alliance? you have to think carefully. The leader of the star Moon Alliance, Chen Yuexing, is a master on the verge of reaching the ninth grade. I might as well tell you that behind her is senior brother Yao Tianyu, who is on the bronze ranking. If you dare to act rashly, you’ll be doomed eternally.”</p><p>Liu Wei shouted with an ugly expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure paused and he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“Yao Tianyu, it’s Yao Tianyu.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a shocking murderous intent.</p><p>At this moment, on the third floor of the star Moon Tower, a few young men were observing the situation below.</p><p>One of them was wearing a long robe with stars and moon emblazoned on it. This person was the leader of the star Moon Alliance, Chen Yuexing.</p><p>“Alliance master, aren’t you going to make a move now?”</p><p>One of the young men asked.</p><p>“There’s no need for us to do anything. Just let Lu Ming do whatever he wants. It’s worth it for trash like Liu Wei and the others to be beaten up. Senior brother Yao Tianyu and the people from the Tribunal Council will be here soon. At that time, we can seize the opportunity to take down Lu Ming.”</p><p>Chen Yuexing smiled faintly.</p><p>In his eyes, Liu Wei and the others were just pawns that he could use.</p><p>“Alliance master is wise,”</p><p>The other young men took the opportunity to flatter him.</p><p>Below, Liu Wei saw that Lu Ming had stopped. He thought that Lu Ming was afraid of Yao Tianyu’s reputation. He immediately looked smug and shouted, ” Lu Ming, you’ve slapped two members of the star Moon Alliance. This is equivalent to smashing the star Moon Alliance’s reputation. It’s a serious crime. How about this? take out 2000 contribution points, no, 5000 contribution points as medical expenses and apologize in public. I’ll consider sparing you.</p><p>“Oh, really? You sure are confident.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to walk forward, step by step.</p><p>Liu Wei’s expression changed again as he shouted, ” “Lu Ming, what do you want to do? I’m warning you, stop right now.”</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. He continued to walk toward Liu Wei step by step.</p><p>Cold sweat began to form on Liu Wei’s face. He suddenly shouted, ” “Go, all together, cripple him.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, more than a dozen young men behind Liu Wei rushed forward. Beams of blood-red light flashed. These young men chose to activate their bloodline without hesitation.</p><p>“Get back to where you came from.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and slapped it.</p><p>A series of loud slaps resounded in the air.</p><p>The star Moon Alliance members who had rushed over were sent flying back at a speed faster than when they had come. All of them fell to the ground, screaming in pain.</p><p>Blood and teeth were spurted all over the ground.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Lu Ming only waved his hand, as if he was swatting flies, and the members of the star Moon Alliance were sent flying.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>A series of gasps could be heard.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards were all dumbfounded.</p><p>The new Vermillion Bird Hall disciples were especially excited. They were all trembling.</p><p>“So strong. Lu Ming has become stronger again.”</p><p>this is a genius, a true super genius. Xuanjian sect, you only see him once in a few years.</p><p>Some of the senior disciples said with complicated expressions.</p><p>All of a sudden, Liu Wei was the only one left at the gate of the star Moon Tower.</p><p>He was so frightened that his face turned pale. He stared at Lu Ming, his body trembling.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I … I … I’m warning you … Don’t do anything rash …”</p><p>Liu Wei’s voice trembled.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not look at him. Instead, he lifted his head to look at the entire Star Moon Tower and mumbled, ” “The star Moon Tower no longer needs to exist.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch at a pillar at the side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The pillar was made of extremely hard black ironwood. However, under Lu Ming’s punch, it exploded into pieces, sending wood chips flying in all directions.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After that, Lu Ming moved and blasted another pillar.</p><p>With the same boom, the pillar was smashed into pieces.</p><p>Ka ka …</p><p>After two pillars were broken, the entire Star Moon Tower started to shake and made cracking sounds.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, you’re crazy. What are you doing? Stop it, stop it!”</p><p>Liu Wei’s face turned deathly pale, and he started to scream madly.</p><p>On the third floor, Chen Yuexing could no longer remain calm. She shouted madly,”Damn it, damn it, what is this guy trying to do?”</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. The sound of a sword rang out as he unsheathed his long sword. He continuously slashed out a few sword Qis towards the pillars at the side of the star Moon Tower.</p><p>The sword Qi whistled and was extremely sharp. It directly cut down four pillars on the left and right.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
