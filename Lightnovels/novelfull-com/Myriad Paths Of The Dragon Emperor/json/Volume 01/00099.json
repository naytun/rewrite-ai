Duanmu Hu practices a defensive black grade low level martial skill, ” heavenly Tiger body protection technique “. One is for defense, and the other is for attack. Isn’t this very interesting? ”</p><p>Everyone came to a realization.</p><p>Feng xinglie and Duanmu Hu were like a spear and a shield. They were the exact opposite. This battle would determine whether Feng xinglie’s spear attack was stronger or Duanmu Hu’s Shield Defense was stronger.</p><p>Whoever was stronger would win!</p><p>This situation was not only happening here, it was happening everywhere.</p><p>Many senior disciples had been in the sect for five to eight years. Their cultivation might not be high, but they had sharp eyes and knew a lot of information.</p><p>Many people were even more interested now that they knew the martial techniques that the two were good at.</p><p>“Now, let the battle begin!”</p><p>The judge announced and retreated to the side.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Instantly, Feng xinglie and Duanmu Hu’s bodies exploded with powerful auras.</p><p>Their auras collided in the air.</p><p>At this moment, Feng xinglie moved. He unsheathed his long sword and the sword light was like a bolt of lightning. It pierced through the air and stabbed towards Duanmu Hu.</p><p>One sword of essence restoring!</p><p>This sword was even stronger than the previous one!</p><p>That was because Feng xinglie had activated his bloodline.</p><p>Six chakras meant a level six bloodline.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had seen a martial artist with level six Blood Meridian.</p><p>This sword was extremely stunning. Everyone’s eyes could not help but stare at it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu Hu took a heavy step forward, followed by a tiger’s roar. Around his body, two fierce Tigers condensed from genuine Qi appeared.</p><p>The two ferocious Tigers leaped and roared around Duanmu Hu’s body, surrounding him so tightly that not even water could escape.</p><p>“Feng xinglie, let’s see how you’re going to break my defense!”</p><p>Duanmu Hu roared.</p><p>In an instant, Feng xinglie’s long sword pierced through Duanmu Hu.</p><p>Roar …</p><p>The two tigers roared and blocked Duanmu Hu’s way, clashing with Feng xinglie’s sword.</p><p>The point where the long sword and the fierce tiger met glowed with a piercing light.</p><p>However, everyone was staring at the fighting ring and did not dare to look away, for fear of missing the exciting moment.</p><p>This was definitely a battle that could be decided in one move. If Feng fenglie could break through Duanmu Hu’s defense, then Feng fenglie would definitely win. On the other hand, Duanmu Hu would win.</p><p>Would Feng xinglie be able to break through Duanmu Hu’s defense?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a loud boom could be heard as Feng xinglie and Duanmu Hu crossed each other.</p><p>Who won?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, Duanmu Hu’s body fell to his knees and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Everyone could see that there was a deep gash on his chest, just like sun Guang’s.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Duanmu Hu stood up and left without looking back.</p><p>Duanmu Hu was defeated, and the whole place was in an uproar.</p><p>wonderful, truly wonderful. Although it was only one move, it was the peak confrontation of attack and defense.</p><p>“Not bad, today’s trip was not in vain.”</p><p>“Do you guys think Feng xinglie will continue to challenge?”</p><p>I don’t think so. His bloodline has exploded. It’s hard for him to recover in a short time.</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>At the same time, the judge on the fighting ring announced Feng xinglie’s victory.</p><p>Under the admiring and envious gazes of the audience, Feng xinglie slowly walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>amazing, that’s amazing. Senior brother Lu Ming, love-struck fool, let’s go back. I must work harder in my cultivation and strive to be on the bronze ranking in the future!</p><p>Pang Shi said with determination.</p><p>“Go back? The battle isn’t over yet, why should we go back?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“The battle isn’t over yet?”</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, pang Shi, Hua Chi, and the others were all stunned.</p><p>Wasn’t the duel over? Lu Ming had not finished yet.</p><p>“Feng xinglie’s battle has ended, but mine has just begun!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then got up and leaped down from the fighting ring.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming floated up to the bronze platform.</p><p>“Lu … What is senior brother Lu Ming doing?”</p><p>Pang Shi said in a daze.</p><p>The others were also stunned.</p><p>“It seems that Lu Ming wants to challenge the bronze platform today!”</p><p>At this moment, Hua Chi’s eyes were extremely bright and shining. At the same time, he was also slightly shocked.</p><p>“What? Senior brother Lu Ming wants to challenge the bronze platform?”</p><p>Pang Shi was extremely shocked.</p><p>The other people nearby were also shocked.</p><p>The disciples of the four courtyards around the bronze platform were ready to leave the arena. They were all stunned when they saw a figure suddenly fly up the platform.</p><p>“Who is that? What are you doing on the bronze platform now?”</p><p>“Eh? Wasn’t that Lu Ming? This year’s newcomer King, Lu Ming!”</p><p>“So he is Lu Ming. What does he want to do? Is he going to challenge the bronze platform?”</p><p>“That’s impossible, right? Even if he’s the newcomer King, he’s only this year’s newcomer King. It’s still too early for him to challenge the bronze stage!”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>There was a burst of discussion in the surroundings, but those who had wanted to leave sat back down.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the middle-aged judge, who was about to leave, and Feng xinglie, who had already walked to the edge of the fighting ring, both stopped.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do on stage?”</p><p>The middle-aged judge asked with a smile.</p><p>elder, Lu Ming requests to challenge the bronze platform!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the crowd instantly boiled over.</p><p>“WOWO, you really want to challenge the bronze platform.”</p><p>“He’s too arrogant and too anxious. Lu Ming is only the newcomer King this year and he wants to challenge the bronze platform? You’re too anxious.”</p><p>he’s just a kid. From what I can see, he’s just envious of Feng xinglie’s consecutive victories. That’s why he’s charging at Feng xinglie. There’s almost no chance of him winning if he challenges Feng xinglie now.</p><p>that’s not necessarily true. I heard that three months ago, during the battle when he demolished the star Moon Tower, he revealed that his combat strength was not weaker than a ninth grade master realm martial artist.</p><p>“So what? What was the use of a ninth grade master on the bronze platform? Which of the people on the bronze platform had combat strength lower than ninth grade master realm? “I acknowledge Lu Ming’s talent. However, he just joined the sect this year. In another year, I don’t deny that he will be able to enter the bronze rank like Feng fenglie. But now, it’s almost impossible.”</p><p>cultivation isn’t enough to challenge the bronze platform. Cultivation can be improved quickly if you have some natural treasures, but martial arts and secret skills take time to comprehend. Those on the bronze list who can cultivate profound level martial arts techniques are all talented and spend a lot of time to comprehend them.</p><p>“Maybe he just wants to win a few more times before he stops?”</p><p>“You’ll stop after a few consecutive wins? He’s the newcomer King, not an ordinary disciple. If he’s going to give up after winning a few rounds, then he’d rather not go up the stage. That would be even more embarrassing.”</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>There was a clamor at the scene but the discussion was almost one-sided. Everyone felt that Lu Ming was too impulsive and should not challenge now. He should lie low like Feng xinglie and wait for his combat strength to reach a certain level before he exploded and shocked the world.</p><p>In the southern stands, pang Shi and the others were still in a daze.</p><p>“Hua Chi, you … How many consecutive wins do you think senior brother Lu Ming can achieve? Can you get on the bronze list?”</p><p>Pang Shi asked in a daze.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I really can’t see through him anymore. However, he’s not an impulsive person. Since he went up, he must have some confidence.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>Even though he said this, shock still remained in Hua Chi’s eyes.</p><p>that’s true. I also believe in senior brother Lu Ming!</p><p>Pang Shi scratched his head.</p><p>Nearby, the others heard this and looked at them with disdain. They felt that the two of them were too blind.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
