It’s none of my business that he needs the dark blood Stone, but do I need it? I’ll let you off on account of us being from the mystical sword sect. ”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said impatiently.</p><p>“You … How dare you? senior brother Yao Tianyu is a genius on the bronze rank, the top of all the bronze disciples. Are you tired of living?”</p><p>The young woman shouted angrily, her face red.</p><p>he’s on the bronze rank! No wonder he’s so arrogant!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>The bronze ranking was a ranking list among the four halls of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Those who could be listed on this list were all top geniuses among the bronze disciples. Each of them was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>He was now standing at the peak of the bronze disciples.</p><p>But what did it have to do with Lu Ming?</p><p>He didn’t care if he was a disciple of the bronze ranking. Did he think that a disciple of the bronze ranking could snatch his dark blood Stone?</p><p>When the woman saw Lu Ming in a daze, she thought that Lu Ming was afraid of the bronze list. She sneered and said,”Lu Ming, hand over the dark blood stones now, then follow us to kowtow and admit your mistakes to senior brother Yao Tianyu. This way, perhaps senior brother Yao Tianyu can let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>“Hand over the dark blood Stone? Kowtow and admit your mistake?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the lady with a strange expression, as if he was looking at a fool. He then said, ” you’re all bronze disciples of the mystical sword sect, but there’s something wrong with your brains!</p><p>The young woman was stunned and only reacted after a long time. She was so angry that her whole body trembled and she screamed, ” “Lu Ming, what did you say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>why are you wasting your breath on him? let’s attack together and cripple him. Then, we’ll bring him to senior brother Yao Tianyu and let him deal with him.</p><p>The hook-nosed youngster also shouted with a sinister expression.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The six of them attacked at the same time and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Sword Qi, saber radiance, claw force, palm wind instantly enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened. With a move of his hand, the star sword appeared in his hand. With a flash of sword radiance, he slashed out more than ten times in an instant.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>With six consecutive screams, the six youths from the Azure Dragon Hall retreated rapidly.</p><p>The six of them were forced back a dozen steps before they could regain their footing. Each of them had a deep sword wound on their chest, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>A single sword had injured six people.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How was that possible? More than a month ago, I heard that he defeated Ning Feng, but it was a difficult victory. How could he become so strong in just a month?”</p><p>The six young men’s faces were pale and their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Go! Let’s go! This person can’t be defeated!”</p><p>The woman screamed and quickly retreated. She was almost scared out of her wits.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other five didn’t dare to stop and ran for their lives.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not pursue.</p><p>He wasn’t confident that he could keep all six of them alive if they scattered.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to dig.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming dug out two more dark bloodstones in a row. There were a total of four dark bloodstones in this place.</p><p>“That’s enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>After checking that there were no more dark bloodstones, Lu Ming turned and left.</p><p>“The blood Reiki flower and the dark Bloodstone have been found. It’s time to return to the sect.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although there were some twists and turns on this trip, everything was considered smooth.</p><p>His figure didn’t stop, and he headed towards the direction of the dark blood Mountain.</p><p>Along the way, he came across a dark blood Wolf that was alone. He tamed it and used it as a Mount.</p><p>That green scale horse had been outside for so long, it had probably run off to who knows where.</p><p>This dark blood Wolf was a demonic beast of second grade second level. It was extremely strong and powerful, far beyond the green scale horse.</p><p>He crossed mountains and ridges as if he was walking on flat ground.</p><p>Very quickly, he left the dark blood Mountain and headed in the direction of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>……</p><p>In the depths of dark blood Mountain, a figure was sitting cross-legged on a large rock on the peak of a mountain.</p><p>This figure looked to be only about seventeen years old. He was handsome and had a cold expression. He was just sitting there casually, but he exuded a sharp aura.</p><p>On the side, there were more than ten young men standing there, not even daring to breathe loudly.</p><p>These youths included the six youths from before.</p><p>“Senior brother Yao, this is what happened.”</p><p>The hook-nosed youth reported.</p><p>This cold-looking young man was Yao Tianyu, a genius on the bronze ranking.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, the strong came first. Although Yao Tianyu was young, the others still respectfully called him senior brother.</p><p>Yao Tianyu furrowed his brows and said, ” “You’re saying that there might be more than one dark blood Stone there and they’re all in Lu Ming’s hands now?”</p><p>“That’s right, senior brother Yao. That Lu Ming is extremely arrogant. Not only did he injure us, but he also didn’t give you any face at all. But Lu Ming said that Yao Tianyu is something …”</p><p>The hook-nosed young man hurriedly replied. Of course, there were a lot of exaggeration in his answer.</p><p>The other five’s eyes flashed, but they didn’t refute the hook-nosed youth.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>After hearing this, Yao Tianyu let out a cold smile and said, ” “Are all the newcomers so arrogant these days? Lu Ming? Newcomer King? How dare you act so arrogantly in front of me? let’s talk about it in a few years!”</p><p>Then, he looked at the crowd and said, ” “Go and find Lu Ming. As long as he’s still in the dark blood Mountain, I won’t let him return to the Vermillion Bird Hall.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A dozen of young men replied loudly. Then, their figures flickered and they left the mountain peak, disappearing into the Forest of the Dark blood Mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yao Tianyu muttered as a killing intent flashed across his eyes.</p><p>……</p><p>The dark blood Wolf was as fast as lightning, and its speed was much faster than the green scale horse.</p><p>In less than seven days, Lu Ming arrived at the skycrossing city again.</p><p>When he passed by the Zhu family’s residence, he discovered that the house was already empty. Even the main door was covered in cobwebs.</p><p>It seemed that the Zhu family had already been destroyed by the Zhou family.</p><p>This was how the divine wilderness continent was. Strength was everything.</p><p>Every day was filled with killing, and every day, countless forces were destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He found a restaurant, ordered some food and wine, and started eating.</p><p>Unconsciously, his thoughts drifted back to fiery wind city.</p><p>the skycrossing city is not far from fiery wind city. It’s only a three-day journey. I don’t need three days to ride the dark blood Wolf. I might as well go back and see my mother!</p><p>Lu Ming thought.</p><p>It had been almost four months since he came out. It was time to go back and take a look.</p><p>He quickly finished his meal, left the restaurant, and headed towards fiery wind city.</p><p>It only took them a little more than two days to return to fiery wind city.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Walking on the streets of fiery wind city, the dark blood Wolf let out a long howl, which frightened everyone on the street.</p><p>what a terrifying demonic beast! Let’s go!</p><p>go and get the experts of the Lu family to suppress it. The demonic beasts have entered the city.</p><p>“Eh? No, look, isn’t that the young master of the Lu family, Lu Ming?”</p><p>“It’s him, it’s really him!”</p><p>There was an uproar nearby. The others kept their distance from Lu Ming, afraid that they would be bitten to death by the dark blood Wolf.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped the dark blood Wolf’s neck, almost causing it to fall to the ground.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Be good.”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The dark blood Wolf barked like a domestic dog, extremely well-behaved.</p><p>The people nearby were dumbfounded.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
