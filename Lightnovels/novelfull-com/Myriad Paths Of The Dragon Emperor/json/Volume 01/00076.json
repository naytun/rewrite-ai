It was called the spear six words formula: Collapse, pull, press, cover, pick, and stab.</p><p>Only by mastering these six basic techniques would he be able to cultivate a more profound spear technique.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming picked up Zhu Bing’s spear in the Supreme shrine and began to cultivate.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear turned into a dot and stabbed forward. Then, with a sweep, the long spear turned into a Moon Shadow and swept out …</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming practiced the six-word formula of the basic spearmanship over and over again.</p><p>……</p><p>In an extremely spacious and luxurious courtyard of the Azure Dragon Court, Yao Tianyu sat in the upper part of the living room with a Golden Saber. A few people were reporting news to him.</p><p>Two of them were the two people who went to summon Lu Ming previously.</p><p>“Senior brother Yao, that Lu Ming is too arrogant. He doesn’t respect senior brother Yao at all.”</p><p>The red-robed youth said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you really think of yourself as the number one person? You dare to ignore me? I will make you regret it. ”</p><p>Yao Tianyu’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Senior brother Yao, Lu Ming is a disciple of the Vermillion Bird Hall. If he’s hiding in the Vermillion Bird Hall, it’ll be hard to deal with him.”</p><p>Another young man said with a frown.</p><p>“Do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Yao Tianyu asked.</p><p>At this time, a shrewd young man rolled his eyes and said, ” “Senior brother Yao, I have an idea that can force Lu Ming to show himself or even make him take the initiative to attack. Then, we can take Lu Ming down with a legitimate reason …”</p><p>The man immediately revealed his plan.</p><p>“Alright, hahaha, let’s do that.”</p><p>Yao Tianyu laughed out loud.</p><p>……</p><p>In the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming had been practicing the six words long spear formula.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>I’m still not stable enough. I didn’t have any Foundation in spear techniques in the past, so my cultivation was too slow.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>also, although this spear is a spiritual weapon of upper second level, its body isn’t soft enough. Looks like I’ll need to buy a new one in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the long spear in his hands and thought to himself.</p><p>The spear was mainly divided into the spearhead and the spear body.</p><p>However, the most important thing was still the spear body. The spear body needed to be both hard and soft.</p><p>It had to be hard and heavy, yet it had to be soft and elastic to a certain extent.</p><p>Only then could the true might of the spear technique be unleashed.</p><p>Zhu Bing’s spear was called the fire pattern spear. The spear body was made of fire pattern iron and the tip of the spear was made of Dark Iron essence. It was considered a good upper second level spiritual weapon, but Lu Ming was not satisfied.</p><p>Although fire patterned iron had a certain degree of elasticity, it was still not enough.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He realized that there was a commotion outside.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine, opened the door, and walked out.</p><p>In the courtyard, a group of people walked in. Hua Chi was among them. However, at this time, his face was bruised and swollen. He and the others carried a person in.</p><p>“Be careful, you guys be careful!”</p><p>Hua Chi called out.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. He walked forward and asked, ” “Hua Chi, what happened? And who injured you?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re back.”</p><p>Hua Chi was slightly taken aback when he saw Lu Ming. Then, he dodged his gaze and said,”I’m fine. I just accidentally fell while doing a mission.”</p><p>“Fell down?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He then looked at the person who was being carried in by the crowd. At first glance, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>This person was none other than pang Shi.</p><p>At this moment, pang Shi’s face was deathly pale, and his eyes were tightly shut. He had already fallen unconscious.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression darkened as he asked.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, and no one spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened as he searched pang Shi’s body.</p><p>The more he fumbled, the gloomier Lu Ming’s expression became.</p><p>The bones in his two legs were broken into several pieces, the bones in his arms were broken, and three of his ribs were broken. What was more serious was that his internal organs had also suffered considerable damage.</p><p>This was clearly a heavy blow.</p><p>Such a ruthless method. With such a serious injury, a single mistake could affect his future martial Dao path. In more serious cases, he might even be crippled.</p><p>“Speak, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was extremely cold.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really fine. It’s all our own fault.”</p><p>Hua Chi said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“What caused this?” Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“Hua Chi, don’t hide it anymore. If you don’t tell me, I’ll tell you.”</p><p>At this time, another young man shouted.</p><p>The young man was called Liu Qi.</p><p>Actually, Lu Ming had some impression of these young people. They were the new disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall this year.</p><p>“Liu Qi, you can’t say!” Hua Chi called out.</p><p>“Hua Chi, shut up.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and then looked at Liu Qi.”Speak!”</p><p>Liu Qi gritted his teeth. senior brother Lu Ming, pang Shi was beaten up. He was beaten up by the people from the star and moon Alliance.</p><p>“Starmoon Alliance?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He had never heard of this Star Moon Alliance.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, the star Moon Alliance is a force formed by some of the Azure Dragon Hall’s disciples. They have built a Star Moon Tower in the trading area, which specializes in buying materials and items from disciples. The price is slightly higher than if you exchange them with contribution points.”</p><p>Liu Qi started explaining.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The trading zone was located in the middle of the four great academies. It was where the disciples of the four great academies bought and sold their items.</p><p>Although it was convenient to exchange at the contribution Palace, the exchange price was relatively lower. Therefore, many disciples would choose to trade in the trading zone when they obtained some materials for alchemy or weapon refinement when they went out for missions. It was more cost-effective that way.</p><p>Liu Qi continued, ” during this period of time, pang Shi and we went out on a mission together. We obtained some materials and sold them at the star Moon Tower. Who knew that the star Moon Tower would be so despicable? they only offered one tael of silver for an item that cost one thousand taels of silver. Pang Shi was so angry that he argued with them. In the end, he was beaten up like this. Even we were beaten up.</p><p>that’s right. The worst thing is that they’re only targeting our Vermillion Bird Hall. The other halls are doing fair trade.</p><p>Another young man shouted.</p><p>“I see, so it’s only directly facing the Vermillion Bird Hall?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. At this moment, he had calmed down. However, the cold glint in his eyes was extremely cold. The other young men could not help but shiver when they met his gaze.</p><p>Hua Chi, quickly invite the sect’s Alchemist over. No matter how much money I have to spend, I have to save pang Shi.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>I’ve already sent someone to invite him. He’ll be here soon. Hua Chi said.</p><p>that’s good. I’ll leave pang Shi in your care.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and walked out.</p><p>Lu Ming, you can’t. There are many experts in the star Moon Tower. You’re not their match. You’ll just be courting death if you go!</p><p>Hua Chi called out.</p><p>“If I don’t go, I won’t be at ease!”</p><p>Lu Ming only left this sentence and strode away.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and pang Shi had only known each other for a few months, pang Shi had a straightforward and honest personality. Lu Ming had long acknowledged him as the son of a Hunter.</p><p>Lu Ming treated him as a friend or even a brother.</p><p>Now that pang Shi had been beaten up to such a state, he could not just ignore it.</p><p>Although he felt that this matter was very strange and could be a trap, he still felt that it was a trap.</p><p>But, so what?</p><p>As a man, there were things he should do and things he shouldn’t.</p><p>If he didn’t, he wouldn’t be at ease!</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
