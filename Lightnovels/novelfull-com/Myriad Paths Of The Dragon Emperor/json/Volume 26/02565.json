She gritted her teeth and her eyes revealed a look of determination. Her body was covered in a black light. Her hands quickly formed a strange seal, and the aura of her body rose rapidly.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Su tu, the bald man, and the others looked at Xie nianqing in shock.</p><p>interesting. This small chiliocosm is really interesting…</p><p>Su tu muttered, his eyes burning with excitement.</p><p>At this moment, the s.p.a.ce beside Xie nianging flashed and Xie nianjun appeared.</p><p>“Xie nianqing, what are you doing? You’re crazy. If you do this, your Foundation will be completely destroyed, and you’ll only become a cripple in the future!”</p><p>Xie nianjun scolded.</p><p>‘I’m not crazy. I must save Lu Ming. I can’t watch him die …”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were firm.</p><p>“Even if you cast that secret, skill with all your might, you’re no match for them. Also, are you not going to do that thing for Lu Ming?”</p><p>Xic nianjun scolded.</p><p>that’s the Tang family’s business. I’m not a member of the Tang family. My surname Xie, my name is Xie nianqing…</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“You…</p><p>Xie nianjun was speechless.</p><p>Indeed, Xie nianging’s memories of this life had devoured the memories of her previous life. Strictly speaking. she was no longer a member of the Tang family.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s aura was getting stronger and stronger, as if he was about to reach the martial G.o.d Realm. “This is …</p><p>Dandan, venerable sovereign rebellion, the t.i.tan bull, and the others all looked a “Could it be that I’m going to die in battle here today?”</p><p>Xie nianging in shock.</p><p>On the ground, Lu Ming lay in a deep pit that was tens of thousands of miles deep. Many thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>Su tu was too strong. He was not someone he could fight against at all.</p><p>He had already done his best. The battle symbol art had doubled his combat strength. His combat strength had reached its peak and could suppress a second level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>However, he was still not su tu’s match, It was completely one-sided.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Lu Ming was indignant. He did not want to give up just like that. If he gave up, the heaven suppressing sigil would be opened and the powerhouses from the yuanluo Palace would enter. The heaven realm’s living beings would most likely be doomed.</p><p>His parents, Xie nianging, his son, granddaughter, and friends would all be in danger.</p><p>He had to protect them.</p><p>master, master, master the world. If I can master the power of this world, I can deal with su tu….</p><p>that’s right. The heavenly Dao is suppressing me because it’s afraid that. I’ll dominate it. Now, I’ve already broken through…</p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p>Since the heavenly Dao was afraid of him breaking through, now that he had broken through, could he dominate the power of this world?</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming’s spiritual consciousness spread out limitlessly.</p><p>ruler, give me the ruler. I am the ruler of this world….</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart, his body emitting a bright purple-gold light.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the entire world was shaking. Endless energy suddenly surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to feel that the entire heaven realm, even the primordial realm and the evil G.o.d Realm were all under his control. He could use the energy of the entire world.</p><p>“This is …</p><p>Xu tu’s pupils contracted sharply, and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, kill!”</p><p>die! su tu roared. He used all his strength and swung his fists continuously, unleashing terrifying attacks. Terrifying fist forces were blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, a wave energy formed around Lu Ming’s body and blocked su tu’s punches.</p><p>“How could this be? Quick, let’s attack together, let’s attack together and interrupt him!”</p><p>Su tu could no longer keep his calm and shouted.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The bald burly man and the other two attacked at the same time. All kinds of attacks were constantly bombarding Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they were blocked by the energy around Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and the others were also shocked.</p><p>Xie nianqing was about to cast a secret skill to fight alongside Lu Ming at all costs. At that moment, the secret skill stopped and her aura fell again,</p><p>“Is this the power of the entire world? it’s too terrifying…</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was in a wonderful state. He seemed to be able to mobilize the energy of the entire</p><p>world.</p><p>“Then, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He swung the combat sword in his hand.</p><p>This sword had mobilized the power of the entire world.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A sword light slashed out, and the attacks of su tu and the other three were directly shattered. The sword light did not stop and continued to slash toward the four of them.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Su tu and the other three’s expressions changed drastically as they retreated frantically. However, the sword light was faster.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The bald man, the human-shaped bat, and the giant python suddenly stopped.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with disbelief and horror.</p><p>Then, their bodies exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>Su tu was the only one who was forced to retreat. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and a long sword mark appeared on his chest, almost cutting him in half.</p><p>mobilizing the power of the entire small chiliocosm… d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it! This is equivalent to the power of a fourth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Su tu roared in fear.</p><p>His figure retreated rapidly, tearing s.p.a.ce apart as he tried to escape.</p><p>“If you want to leave, I am the master of this world!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. A huge hand suddenly appeared behind su tu. It was extremely huge and pressed down on su tu.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Su tu was sent flying like an eagle and crashed heavily into the ground, causing the surrounding land to</p><p>explode.</p><p>Su tu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body almost exploded.</p><p>The scene had completely reversed.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Su tu roared in his heart.

It pierced through su tu’s body and nailed him</p><p>to the ground.</p><p>Su tu struggled with all his might. However, Lu Ming gathered the power of heaven and earth and suppressed his body, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Ah, you’re looking for death. Do you think you can live after killing me? When the true experts of the yuanluo Palace make their move, your small world will be annihilated!”</p><p>Su tu roared.</p><p>“Blowing!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew above su tu and slashed his combat sword down.</p><p>PIT!</p><p>Su tu was killed on the spot.</p><p>Up until now, Lu Ming had killed a number of G.o.ds in front of the heaven suppressing seal. Including the first</p><p>one, there were a total of six G.o.ds.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the s.p.a.ce nearby cracked open and the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the ancestral Dragon was covered in blood and had many injuries, but fortunately, he was</p><p>fine.</p><p>After an intense battle, the ancestral Dragon had also successfully killed his opponent.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s strength was originally similar to the other party’s, but the other party was attacked by the heaven suppressing seal after coming in.
