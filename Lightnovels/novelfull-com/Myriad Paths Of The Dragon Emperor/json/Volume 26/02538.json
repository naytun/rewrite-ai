The seven attacks combined and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. With a shake of his body, he appeared in another direction. He swept the great desolation spear horizontally, shattering the void.</p><p>The seven non-human demigods hurriedly blocked Lu Ming’s attack. However, Lu Ming appeared in another direction and shot out another spear.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, both sides had exchanged dozens of moves. The non- human demigod could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was another loud boom as the two of them exchanged a blow. Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly. Behind him, the space cracked open and Lu Ming rushed into it, disappearing.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>The seven non-human demigods ‘faces were ghastly, but they did not pursue him. They knew that they could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I must report this to the divine ancestor!”</p><p>“We must get rid of Lu Ming as soon as possible!”</p><p>A non-human demigod also left and headed toward the non-human sacred mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, traversed the void and headed for the heaven realm at top speed.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming to arrive at a battlefield outside two world city.</p><p>Now, the camp had been broken through and the battlefield was empty.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the thousand-odd people from the eternal cage appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>As soon as these people appeared, their heads began to spin around.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“This is the heaven realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? Heaven realm?” Everyone was shocked.</p><p>This place was actually the heaven realm.</p><p>Did this not mean that Lu Ming had brought them from the evil god Realm to the heaven realm?</p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p>They traveled through the long void and were in Lu Ming’s small world. How could they be fine?</p><p>Lu Ming could actually bring them from the evil god Realm to the heaven realm. Such a miraculous method made them exclaim in admiration.</p><p>then we have escaped from the evil god World?</p><p>When many people thought of this question, they were all ecstatic.</p><p>They had been locked up in the eternal cage for far too long. Now that they were free, they were extremely excited.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for your help!”</p><p>“I’ll remember this great kindness in my heart. If you need any help in the future, just ask!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>These people expressed their gratitude to Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>everyone from the prison suppression field, I have news for you. The ancestor Dragon has brought the prison suppression field to the heaven realm. You can go to him!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The prison suppression field was taken to the heaven realm?”</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were also overjoyed.</p><p>In this way, they could reunite with the people from the prison suppression field.</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was directed in one direction.</p><p>There were more than a dozen foreign races there, all of them at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had heard Qing Cang say that these alien races were imprisoned in the eternal cage because they opposed the evil god race’s attack on the heaven realm.</p><p>everyone, I’m afraid that a decisive battle will break out between the heaven realm and the evil god tribe in the near future. Where are you going to go? ” Lu Ming said.</p><p>The expressions of the evil god tribe members changed, and they became very complicated.</p><p>Although they were against the evil god race attacking the heaven realm, they couldn’t help the heaven realm deal with the evil god race.</p><p>“Let’s leave and find a place to live in seclusion, away from this mess!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members sighed.</p><p>alright, I’ll help you remove this sealed armor!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and cast The Way of the Master, enveloping them.</p><p>Those at the heavenly Emperor realm and above wore blood-red armor that could seal one’s cultivation base. However, with Lu Ming’s current strength, he could easily remove these armors.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>More than ten alien races cupped their fists at Lu Ming, then turned around and strode away.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming removed the armors on the remaining people.</p><p>Out of the remaining 1000 or so people, at least 300 of them had the cultivation base of the heavenly Emperor realm. This was an extremely shocking force. If he brought them back to the heaven realm, they would be of use in the future when they fought against the evil god race.</p><p>Lu Ming put these people back into the small world. He then entered two world city quietly and released them at a deserted place.</p><p>These people thanked Lu Ming again and left one by one.</p><p>The people from the prison guard field went to look for them.</p><p>The living beings of the heaven realm had relatives and friends in the heaven realm. They had been locked up in the eternal cage for many years. This time, when they returned, they naturally had to visit their relatives and friends.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had returned to the Dragon sovereign peak alone!</p><p>Lu Ming was standing against the wind on the peak of the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>“Now, my combat strength has fallen back!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Previously, he felt that his body was filled with battle strength, but now, he fell back down.</p><p>“Could it be because of the battle formula? let’s try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the battle formula and started to activate it.</p><p>Previously, when he had a breakthrough in the battle symbol art, his battle power was stronger than before when he used his full strength, but it was not as exaggerated.</p><p>“It’s useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He did not give up and continued to activate the battle character formula.</p><p>After activating it seven or eight times…</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be surging with endless power. A casual move of his was filled with terrifying combat strength.</p><p>His combat strength had doubled.</p><p>“This… Is there still a chance?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to experiment and explore. Indeed, he discovered that there was a probability.</p><p>He had to activate the ” battle ” character about ten times before he could trigger it successfully once. His battle prowess would double.</p><p>The success rate was about one-tenth.</p><p>However, even if it was only one-tenth, Lu Ming was already ecstatic.</p><p>At his current realm, there were too few secret skills that could allow him to burst out in combat power.</p><p>At this critical moment, his combat strength suddenly doubled. It was extremely terrifying. He could turn the tables and kill his opponent.</p><p>For example, if he hadn’t triggered the doubling of his combat power in the myriad World Cage, he probably wouldn’t have been able to escape the siege of seven non-human demigods.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming felt that this was because he was not very familiar with the cultivation of the battle formula yet. As his understanding of the battle formula deepened, the probability of this happening would increase.</p><p>In the end, it might reach a 100% trigger rate.</p><p>In the future, as his understanding of the battle formula deepened, would he be able to trigger, threefold or fourfold increase in combat power?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but let his imagination run wild.</p><p>Bai Ya said that the ‘battle’ character is extremely shocking even in the primeval universe. Once it’s exposed, it will attract countless experts to fight for it. It seems that he’s not lying!</p><p>Lu Ming only now realized how terrifying and shocking the battle formula was. now that I’ve achieved a breakthrough in the battle symbol art, I should be able to break through the heavenly Dao’s obstruction with my current combat strength. I’ll go into seclusion and try to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>How strong would he be once he broke through to the heavenly Emperor realm?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
