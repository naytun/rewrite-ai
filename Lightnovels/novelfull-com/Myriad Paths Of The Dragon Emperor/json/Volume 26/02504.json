There were no complicated gaudy moves. Every punch and every palm strike was very direct, but the power was terrifyingly strong.</p><p>Each punch and palm had the power to destroy the world. A peak Emperor would be blown up with each move.</p><p>The four martial God puppets wore blood-red armor and each of them held a spear. They were like invincible generals, their Spears piercing through the air with unparalleled killing intent.</p><p>The eight people on both sides were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor looked at each other, their eyes gleaming.</p><p>In the past, it was impossible for them to join forces. But now, they could only join forces.</p><p>The two of them moved and pounced toward the puppet that was fighting Long Yan.</p><p>The three of them joined forces and attacked the puppet with their own abilities.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, the non-human divine ancestor, was injured and not at his peak, but the two of them together were still equivalent to a martial God.</p><p>The three of them joined forces and immediately suppressed the other party.</p><p>No one dared to go near the war God’s battlefield.</p><p>The battle between Lu Ming and the rest of the puppets had also broken out. However, it was far away from the battlefield of the martial gods.</p><p>These puppets also had astonishing combat strength. There were many experts, peak heavenly Emperor, and even half a step into the martial God Realm.</p><p>However, the number was a little low, only around too.</p><p>The number of Lu Ming and the rest was even greater.</p><p>They were from the heaven realm, the evil god tribe, the yellow spring sect, and the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>The four sides added together had far more puppets.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and joined forces with Xie nianqing to fight a puppet at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>This kind of puppet was formed by a large array, but its entire body seemed to be made of an extremely hard metal. It was indestructible, and every move it made was powerful. It collided with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, causing it to shake continuously.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body was surrounded by black light, which condensed into Lotus swords. They were extremely sharp and attacked from the side, leaving sword marks on the puppet’s body.</p><p>Although the puppet was strong, the two of them working together could still suppress it.</p><p>For example, Qing Cang and the Titan longhorn beetle had almost all joined forces. They had the upper hand.</p><p>Of course, this was only possible because they had joined forces. Otherwise, no one or two of them would be a match for these puppets.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Not long after, a puppet was blown up, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>The puppet that Lu Ming was fighting with was beheaded by Xie nianqing. Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and crushed the puppet into pieces.</p><p>Qing Cang, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the evil god tribe had all achieved victory. One puppet after another was destroyed.</p><p>A moment later, more than too puppets were all destroyed and the scene was cleaned up.</p><p>Now, there were only four war god golems left.</p><p>At this moment, the ancestral Dragon, the non-human divine ancestor, and Long Yan had gained the absolute advantage. The martial God puppet was in a precarious situation, and its body was covered in cracks.</p><p>“Divine power!”</p><p>Dandan stood there and sighed with envy.</p><p>“Shen power?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to dandan.</p><p>the power controlled by the martial God is divine power. It’s an extremely terrifying power. Laws, great DAOs, and heavenly Dao are like tofu in front of divine power!</p><p>Dandan said, feeling even more envious.</p><p>Not to mention him, which peak heavenly Emperor wouldn’t be envious?</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the power used by the ancestral Dragon, the divine ancestor of the foreign tribe, and the martial God of the netherworld had nothing to do with laws or heavenly Dao. It was a terrifying and indestructible power.</p><p>This power enveloped their entire bodies, making their attacks indestructible. At the same time, their defensive power was also shockingly high.</p><p>this kind of power is similar to little Qing’s power, but it’s many times stronger than little Qing’s!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>The crowd watched from afar. They had no power to interfere in the battle between the martial gods.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, one of the puppet’s arms shattered, and its aura began to weaken.</p><p>Zulong, the non-human divine ancestor, and Long Yan’s spirits were roused, and all kinds of attacks poured out like a storm.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As they attacked, the puppet’s body kept exploding. With a loud boom, it exploded and turned into waves of energy that dissipated.</p><p>As the puppet was destroyed, the outcome was already decided.</p><p>The three of them joined forces to attack another martial God puppet. Together with the other puppet, they were four against one.</p><p>This time, it didn’t take long for the puppet to be destroyed.</p><p>Just like that, they attacked one martial God puppet at a time and destroyed them one by one. After ten minutes or so, the remaining martial God puppets were all destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as all the martial God puppets were destroyed, the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor returned to their respective forces and stood guard against each other.</p><p>alright, you can cross the bridge. We from the yellow Springs world can’t cross!</p><p>Long Yan said and retreated to the side with the people of the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>The people of the yellow spring sect also retreated to the side.</p><p>“Ancestral Dragon, let’s have a showdown after crossing the bridge!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor looked at the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon said.</p><p>In the next moment, both sides moved, rushing towards the stone bridge.</p><p>The stone bridge was very wide, and the people from both sides each took one side. They looked at each other as they charged towards the other side of the stone bridge.</p><p>This stone bridge was really long. It was thousands of miles long, which showed how wide the abyss was.</p><p>However, to them, a distance of several thousand miles could be crossed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Soon, they had crossed the stone bridge.</p><p>On the other side of the stone bridge was a hilly area that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared and pounced toward the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s fighting spirit soared as he fought with the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The evil god race and the living beings of the heaven realm were also filled with killing intent. They turned into streaks of rainbow light and collided with each other.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The entire region was boiling. The space was torn apart and terrifying energy spread in all directions.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Qing Cang turned into a nine-headed Golden Lion. The nine heads roared and pounced on Xiang duo Lei.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle also transformed into its true form. Its horns were like Battle Blades as it fought a peak heavenly Emperor of the evil god tribe.</p><p>In addition, the nine lives devilish silkworm and the others were also fighting against the other side’s experts.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and swung it continuously, blowing up a six-star celestial Thearch of the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>A figure suddenly charged toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>This was a member of the royal family of the evil god tribe. His purple hair was like a waterfall, and he had an overbearing aura. He gave Lu Ming an extremely strong sense of pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and blasted it at the man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The man struck out with his palm and collided with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook violently and was thrown backward. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging toward him. His body shook violently and he was forced to retreat. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This is… He’s an invincible expert who’s half a step into the martial God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
