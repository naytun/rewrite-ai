He thought that the woman had come to help and it would be dangerous if he stayed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The woman was surprised. She thought that Lu Ming would try his best to hold her back when the experts from the stellar iron mine noticed her and rushed over. She did not expect Lu Ming to run faster than her. “Is he not from the yuan Luo Palace?”</p><p>The woman thought to herself, and then her figure moved, leaving the place.</p><p>Not long after they left, a few figures appeared at the place where they had just fought.</p><p>Looking at the ravines on the ground, one of the old men revealed a sinister sneer, it seems like the</p><p>righteous Army hasn’t given up and is still lingering nearby!</p><p>hehe, we’ve captured their people, so they naturally want to save them. Then we’ll just wait, wait to capture them all in one fell swoop!</p><p>Another old woman sneered.</p><p>In a flash, the few of them disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming ran for more than 100000 miles before he stopped and found a place to rest.</p><p>‘I’ll observe for a while. If it doesn’t work, I’ll have to find a hidden place on the underworld star and merge the small world with the primal universe!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Although there was a huge risk of being discovered by the experts of the yuanluo Palace, there was no other</p><p>way.</p><p>After resting for two days, Lu Ming headed in the direction of the stellar iron ore.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!….</p><p>Lu Ming had walked for a while when he heard the sound of intense fighting ahead. It was obvious that someone was fighting</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered. He then restrained his aura and leaned over carefully.</p><p>Three middle-aged men were attacking a woman.</p><p>“It’s her!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The woman who was being attacked was the beautiful woman who had attacked Lu Ming previously.</p><p>At this moment, the woman was surrounded by three burly men and was in a critical situation.</p><p>Among the three burly men, two of them were at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm, while the other one had reached the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Although the woman was strong, she was no match for the three of them.</p><p>a little girl from the zhengfa Army. Not bad. She’s pretty enough. I can take her down and enjoy her. Haha!</p><p>The third level void G.o.d Realm burly man used an iron rod and waved it, creating loud rumbles and shocking power.</p><p>With one strike, the woman’s body trembled and she was sent flying. She spat out a mouthful of blood and her face turned pale.</p><p>“b.a.s.t.a.r.d from the yuanluo Palace…</p><p>The woman gritted her teeth and tried her best to run to the side, but the three men were tightly holding her, making it difficult for her to escape.</p><p>“So she’s not from the yuanluo Palace, but from the righteous Army!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was really like he had worn out his iron shoes in a long search, but found it without any effort!</p><p>Song mo had mentioned before that the power created by the ancestor of technique was called the righteous</p><p>Army.</p><p>Since this woman was from the righteous Army, she could not die at the hands of the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming began to cast the battle formula, triggering the double combat strength.</p><p>He was lucky this time. It only took three trics and Lu Ming’s combat strength was doubled.</p><p>Lu Ming approached carefully. He suddenly burst out and charged forward.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming made his move, the other party noticed him. A second-level void G.o.d Realm burly man berated him and turned around to attack.</p><p>However, the other party had attacked in a hurry and could not block Lu Ming. He was sent flying by Lu</p><p>Ming’s sword.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to step forward and strike with his sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The burly man was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing the burly man, Lu Ming charged towards another second-level void G.o.d-level burly man.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes lit up when she saw Lu Ming. Her body flashed rapidly as she dodged the attack of the third-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse.</p><p>Without the two second level void G.o.d Realm men’s attacks, the woman’s pressure was greatly reduced. She dodged a few of her opponent’s attacks, and her situation was much better.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The third level void G.o.d Realm burly man roared and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left. He did not want to confront the other party head-on.</p><p>The burly man roared and chased after the woman, but she had already run far away.</p><p>Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. He sprinted at top speed and then made an are in the air, chasing after</p><p>the woman.</p><p>After the two big men chased for a while, they seemed to have some apprehensions and didn’t dare to continue chasing. Instead, they stopped and sent out a message.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the young lady and ran for more than a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>At this moment, the young woman stopped and looked at Lu Ming. Although you saved me, you don’t have</p><p>to keep following me. What do you want?”</p><p>“You’re from the righteous Army?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. The woman’s expression changed slightly. that’s right. I’m very curious. Who are you?” The people from the</p><p>yuanluo Palace seem to want to deal with you too!”</p><p>you’re really from the righteous Army!</p><p>“I’m from the same hometown as the ancestor of technique. Can you take me to see him?” Lu Ming was</p><p>overjoyed.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique? Who is it?”</p><p>The woman frowned in confusion.</p><p>“En, you don’t know about the ancestor of technique? The ancestor of technique was the one who created</p><p>the righteous Army!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You mean the general? You’re from the same hometown as the general?”</p><p>The woman was puzzled.</p><p>“Yes, it’s true. Now the entire dark underworld star is hunting me down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>regardless of whether you are from the same hometown as the general, it is a fact that you and the yuan Luo</p><p>Palace are enemies. The enemy of an enemy is a friend. However, it is impossible for me to bring you to the</p><p>general now!</p><p>The woman shook her head and sighed.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a bad premonition.</p><p>‘Last time, some of us came to attack the star Iron mine on the dark underworld star, planning to take away a</p><p>batch of their iron ores. However, we didn’t expect that the other party had set up an ambush in advance. A</p><p>part of us died in battle, a part of us were captured by the other party, and only a part of us managed to</p><p>escape!</p><p>the senior who controlled the starry sky battleship has also been captured by the enemy. Now, the starry sky battleship is in their hands. If we want to escape from the underworld star, we have to rescue the righteous</p><p>Army and take back the starry sky battleship!</p><p>The woman said.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless.</p><p>It wasn’t casy for him to meet the people of the righteous Army, but they ended up like him, trapped and</p><p>unable to escape.</p><p>now, there are many experts from the yuanluo Palace in the stellar iron mine. They are waiting for us to</p><p>attack so that they can catch us all in one fell swoop, I have been looking for news in this area!</p><p>The woman said.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why the woman attacked him the moment she saw him. She probably thought he</p><p>was from the yuanluo Palace and wanted to capture him for information.</p><p>“What’s the cultivation level of the strongest expert in the stellar iron mine?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p>“Ninth level void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>The woman said.</p><p>“Then what cultivation level did your people who escaped have?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>there’s also a ninth-level virtual G.o.d, but there’s only one of them. On the other hand, there are several</p><p>ninth-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses in the stellar iron mine. Therefore, we’re no match for them at all!</p><p>The woman said. there’s also a ninth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. Haha, that’s enough. I can help you save your people</p><p>and take back the interplanetary warship!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out laughing.</p><p>Swipe left to continue &gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
