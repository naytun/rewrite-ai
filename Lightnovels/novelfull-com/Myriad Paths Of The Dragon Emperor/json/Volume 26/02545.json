How dare you run out? I’m going to roast you today!”</p><p>A non-human King said coldly.</p><p>[*ck you! I couldn’t beat you back then, but don’t think that I can’t beat you now. If I don’t step on your faces today, I won’t be called the world ghost G.o.d!</p><p>Dandan was furious and her body transformed into a giant turtle. The turtle sh.e.l.l was covered with strange patterns and looked ancient.</p><p>A terrifying aura was emitted from dandan’s body.</p><p>demiG.o.d! How is this possible? you’ve also broken through!</p><p>A non-human King shouted in disbelief.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>The remaining top ten Battle Reasts had all broken through to the demiG.o.d realm. How was this possible? “Kill! I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Dandan laughed loudly. His body was incomparably huge, but his speed was astonishing. His two turtle claws swatted down, and endless symbols filled the air, intertwining to form a terrifying attack.</p><p>so what if I’ve broken through? I’ll still die!</p><p>The two kings of the non-human race revealed ferocious expressions and charged at dandan at the same time. They wanted to kill her together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion sounded out and the void exploded. Dandan’s huge body retreated, but the two non-human Kings also retreated.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p><p>The two non-human Kings ‘expressions were extremely ugly, and they were also extremely shocked. Dandan’s combat strength was so powerful that she could fight with both of them at the same time. In the demiG.o.d realm, there was usually not much difference in combat strength. They were almost on par. There were very few who could be stronger than others.</p><p>Back then, the chaos Thearch and the undying Thearch were more powerful than ordinary demiG.o.ds, but they still couldn’t fight against two demiG.o.ds.</p><p>In the evil G.o.d tribe, only the King of the number one royal tribe had the battle prowess to fight against two demiG.o.ds. However, dandan also had such strength. How could they not be shocked?</p><p>haba, is this all you have? again!</p><p>Dandan laughed and charged at the two non-human Kings. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>With this, the nine non-human Kings were all blocked.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>A burly man on the ancestral Dragon’s side laughed.</p><p>The others beside the ancestral Dragon also laughed.</p><p>This was truly a pleasant surprise.</p><p>They hadn’t expected Qing Cang, the five elements, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the others to all become demiG.o.ds. Originally, they were all going to go and stop the non-human King, but now, they could temporarily bide their time and guard against other methods of the non-human race.</p><p>This was very beneficial to them.</p><p>“Could this be the effect of the life fruit?”</p><p>Опе</p><p>f them said.</p><p>that’s right. This time, Lu Ming obtained many fruits of life. I’ll share them with you guys and the five elements!</p><p>moreover, Lu Ming has some leftovers. He has given them to t.i.tan, nine-lives, and the rest. Therefore, they relied on the energy of the fruit of life to break through the bottleneck!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s all thanks to him this time!”</p><p>Another person sighed.</p><p>“En!” The others all nodded.</p><p>All these years, there were not many fruits of life left in Lu Ming’s hands. He had almost given them away. However, everyone understood that the nine lives devilish silkworm, Qing Cang, and the others were able to break through because of their shocking talent. They had also acc.u.mulated enough for many years. That was why they could break through in one go with the help of the life fruit.</p><p>If it were any other peak heavenly Emperor, they might not be able to break through even with the fruit of life.</p><p>However, this was definitely a pleasant surprise for the heaven realm.</p><p>On the other hand, the evil G.o.d tribe was the complete opposite.</p><p>Beside the non-human divine ancestor, the king of the number one royal family and the old Kings all had dark expressions.</p><p>“How is this possible? How could the top ten Battle Beasts have all broken through to demiG.o.d-level?” The number one king roared. He really couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>Not to mention him, even the non-human divine ancestor could not figure it out. Ile had no idea that Lu Ming had obtained the inheritance of the netherworld Island master and a large number of life fruits. Therefore, his face was extremely gloomy now.</p><p>Their plan had been disrupted.</p><p>Their original plan was to use the nine non-human Kings to attack the ruins of end battlefield and lure out the demiG.o.ds from the heaven realm.</p><p>After that, they could send these old Kings to attack the two world city battlefield with all their might. They could break through the two world city in one fell swoop and charge into the Tai Qing heaven region, razing it to the ground.</p><p>But now, this plan would not work!</p><p>have the sky-breaking Army get ready. Also, all of you attack together and attack two world city!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The number one king and the other old Kings all nodded. Their eyes were filled with coldness as they tore through s.p.a.ce.</p><p>The moment. they moved, the ancestral Dragon discovered them!</p><p>those old guys from the alien race are about to make their move. Next, it’s up to you guys!</p><p>Zu long said to the people beside him.</p><p>“We’ll fight to the death!”</p><p>There were more than ten people beside the ancestral Dragon. They were experts that the heaven realm had acc.u.mulated over countless years.</p><p>Among them, there were not only those who cultivated the nomological system, but also those who cultivated the primordial martial arts, the primordial demonic path, and the primordial body cultivation path</p><p>from the primordial era.</p><p>And there were experts from the prison suppression field.</p><p>All of them were demiG.o.ds.</p><p>They tore through s.p.a.ce and appeared on the battlefield of two world city in the next moment.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Not far in front of them, the s.p.a.ce cracked open one after another, and more than a dozen figures appeared.</p><p>It was the number one king and his group.</p><p>The gazes of the two sides collided, creating brilliant sparks.</p><p>“It’s you old fogeys. Many of you were injured in the ancient battle. Do you think you can stop us?”</p><p>The number one king said coldly.</p><p>“Try it and you’ll know!”</p><p>An old man in sackcloth from the heavenly realm said.</p><p>you’re bluffing. Let’s try. Attack!</p><p>The number one king tier directly charged towards the heaven realm’s experts. The heaven realm’s side also moved and charged towards the evil G.o.d race.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded as the two sides clashed, causing continuous explosions. The number one king was extremely powerful, and his battle prowess was far above the other demiG.o.ds. However, he also had enemies. On the side of the heaven realm, there were also existences whose battle. prowess was not weaker than his.</p><p>“Sovereign rebellion, your origin was injured back then. How can you recover to your peak?</p><p>The number one king roared!</p><p>His opponent was a middle-aged man with a tall and straight posture.</p><p>The middle-aged man was known as the Renegade Emperor. At his peak, he was even more powerful than</p><p>the chaos Emperor. However, during the ancient war, venerable sovereign rebellion’s origin was injured. He had been in seclusion for all these years. Logically speaking, his injuries should not have recovered so quickly.</p><p>“You old fogeys were also injured back then, but didn’t you recover?”</p><p>Venerable sovereign rebellion laughed coldly as he continued to clash with the number one king.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
