Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The metal ball was astonishingly fast. It was like a bolt of golden lightning, flying around the cave. The four of them were unable to stop it.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the way of domination, enveloping the area and grabbing at the metal ball.</p><p>The metal ball seemed to be a little afraid. In a flash, it quickly retreated.</p><p>Xie nianjun was on the other side. She reached out and was about to grab the metal ball.</p><p>However, the metal ball suddenly expanded and turned into a huge ball with a diameter of several meters. It collided with Xie nianjun’s palm.</p><p>ROOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Xic nianjun’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart shook.</p><p>Although Xie nianjun’s cultivation base was only at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, her divine power was strong enough to fight against a fourth level void G.o.d Realm powerhouse. However, she was still knocked back by the metal ball.</p><p>However, the metal ball was also pushed back by Xic nianjun and rushed towards Tong Xi ‘cr.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s expression changed. She did not have Xie nianjun’s strength. A long sword appeared in her hand, and she stabbed at the metal ball.</p><p>However, a shocking scene appeared at that moment. A huge mouth suddenly appeared on the smooth surface of the metal ball. The Golden metal formed fangs, and when it opened its mouth, it bit towards Tong Xi ‘er’s sword.</p><p>With a crack, Tong Xi ‘er’s long sword was directly bitten in half. The front part was swallowed by the metal ball, and it began to eat it with a’ ka Beng ka Beng ‘sound.</p><p>“This…</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them looked at each other.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘cr’s longsword was a divine artifact. Although it was only a level one low-grade divine artifact, it was still extremely hard. Now, it had actually been bitten off by the metal ball and was even eating it.</p><p>This metal ball, how could it be so abnormal?</p><p>What made them even more speechless was that at this moment, a pair of eyes had actually appeared on the metal ball’s mouth. The eyes were squinted, and it seemed to be enjoying it very much.</p><p>A lump of metal with intelligence!</p><p>The same thought flashed through their minds.</p><p>A treasure, this was definitely a treasure. A lump f metal that actually had intelligence was definitely extraordinary.</p><p>Buzzzzz! Buzzard.</p><p>Everyone moved again, pouncing towards the metal ball.</p><p>However, this metal ball was very slippery and smart. It seemed to have noticed that Tong Xi ‘er’s combat strength was the weakest among the four, and it directly rushed towards her.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er no longer dared to take out her divine weapon to attack. She could only circulate her divine power and wrap it around the metal ball.</p><p>However, the power of the metal ball was extremely shocking. With one hit, it knocked away Tong Xi ‘er’s divine power. Tong Xi’ er’s delicate body trembled, and she was also sent flying, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Her strength was not enough to resist this metal ball.</p><p>However, Lu Ming arrived just in time. With a wave of his hand, the power of domination formed a huge hand and grabbed the metal ball.</p><p>The metal ball seemed to be extremely afraid of the ruler’s power. Its eyes were filled with fear, and it quickly retreated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this metal ball seems to be afraid of your Dominator’s power. I’ll trap it, and you grab it!”</p><p>Xic nianqing shouted. His body was covered in black light. Black lotuses appeared one after another and pressed toward the metal ball.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianjun also attacked with all his might. Snow-white lotus flowers appeared and pressed down on the metal ball.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The metal ball rushed towards Xic nianqing and collided with the Black Lotus.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Lotus flowers kept exploding. However, after they exploded, more lotus flowers appeared. The metal ball was directly blocked.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and grabbed with both hands. His Dominator’s power formed a large net, and enveloped the metal ball.</p><p>The metal ball was directly enveloped by the ruler’s Power’s nct.</p><p>It tried to break free from the net, but strangely, it couldn’t break free.</p><p>Lu Ming began to shrink the Dominator’s power and the big net became smaller.</p><p>In the end, the metal ball became well-behaved and stayed there without moving.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming grabbed the metal ball in his hand.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>When Lu Ming grabbed the metal ball, he almost dropped it on the ground.</p><p>This was extremely shocking. Although all matter in the primeval universe could not be compared to the heaven realm and the primordial realm, and its ma.s.s was many times greater, Lu Ming almost lost his grip on this metal ball. Its weight was estimated to be several mountains heavier.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to take a closer look, a sharp spike suddenly emerged from the metal ball. This spike was extremely sharp. It pierced through the power of domination that Lu Ming had covered his hand with and his skin. A stream of blood flowed onto the metal ball.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and almost threw the metal ball away. Fortunately, the metal ball did not continue to move. The stream of blood seeped into the metal ball and disappeared.</p><p>A dark red light flashed on the surface of the metal ball.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming actually felt that the metal ball had become lighter, as if it had no weight at all.</p><p>“This is …</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems that you’re fated with it and it has recognized you as its master!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said as he walked over. There was a hint of envy in his eyes.</p><p>There were not many things that could make Xie nianjun envious.</p><p>“You’ve recognized me as your master?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also in a daze.</p><p>If I’m not wrong, this should be a kind of metal life form born from the origin of the world. This kind of metal life form is rare even in the vast primal universe. It’s very precious. Now that it has recognized you as its master, it means that it’s fated with you. If you train it well in the future, it might be a great help to you!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing revealed a happy expression.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er looked envious. However, she did not help much this time.</p><p>others who captured the metal ball. She could not say anything.</p><p>“Let’s go, we need to leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>was Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the</p><p>They didn’t have much time and couldn’t delay any longer. If that Giant Eagle returned, they would be in</p><p>trouble.</p><p>Immediately, they rushed out of the cave and ran in the opposite direction of the origin Luo Palace. Soon, they disappeared from the cave.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the rest had left, a piercing screech was heard. The wind whistled and the giant metal Eagle had returned.</p><p>It landed at the entrance of the cave and seemed to sense something. Then, it let out an angry cry.</p><p>Buzz! Buwww.wd! Bowwwww!</p><p>The giant metal Eagle seemed to have gone mad. It flapped its wings and slashed at everything it touched, be</p><p>it metal plants or metal ground. Everything exploded and turned into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, it soared into the sky and then dove down again, wreaking havoc on the ground.</p><p>A seventh level void G.o.d Realm metal Eagle was truly terrifying and had shocking destructive power.</p><p>It destroyed everything nearby madly before it gradually llew into the distance and disappeared.</p><p>After the metal Eagle left, a figure flashed and appeared at the entrance of the cave.</p><p>It was the bald man from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>He rushed into the cave, but soon, he rushed out of the cave.</p><p>“Ah, d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, who is it?”</p><p>The bald burly man roared, his face extremely ferocious.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
