We can’t do it alone. We have to cooperate with the netherworld sect!</p><p>however, the two old fogeys of the netherworld sect are stubborn and have a grudge against us. Even if we go to them, I’m afraid they won’t agree!</p><p>The Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire said.</p><p>no matter what, I have to give it a try. How about this? after I deal with zu long and the others, I’ll go to the netherworld sect and see if I can invite those two to come out!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said.</p><p>After chatting for a while, the non-human divine ancestor left.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest set off and met up with the people from the heaven realm. Then, they headed for the netherworld imperial capital.</p><p>In the netherworld imperial capital, outside the eastern city gate, nearly 200 people, including Long Chen and Feng Ling, were tied up outside the city gate. It had been more than a month.</p><p>it’s been more than a month, and no one has come to save you. It seems that you people from the heaven realm have given up on you. Hahaha!</p><p>Duo Lei stood above Long Chen’s group and sneered coldly.</p><p>Long Chen and the others looked cold and did not respond.</p><p>I’m telling you, there’s no hope for the heaven realm. You’ve been completely defeated. This time, in the yellow Springs world, my clan will kill all your experts. When we get out, we’ll flatten the heaven realm and kill all of you!</p><p>Said duo Lei resentfully.</p><p>“Duo Lei, do you only know how to talk now?”</p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice sounded.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Duo Lei suddenly turned around, his cold eyes sweeping across the room.</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>The voice rang out. Then, the void rippled and a figure appeared.</p><p>That person was Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he was the only one who appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, duo Lei’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The void trembled and cracked open. From the spatial crack, figures stepped out one after another. They were all experts from the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire. There were no less than ten peak heavenly emperors. Their terrifying auras completely enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Feng Ling, their faces changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go. Leave quickly!”</p><p>Phoenix spirit and Dragon Chen shouted.</p><p>“Leave? to where?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to come alone. You’re really stupid. Stay then!”</p><p>Duo Lei sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? Lookwho this is.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He reached out and grabbed at the air. A figure suddenly appeared in his hands.</p><p>“The first Prince!”</p><p>Seeing this person, duo le and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, release the first Prince!”</p><p>Duo Lei shouted anxiously.</p><p>He had never expected that the first Prince was in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“If you want me to let him go, that’s fine, but you have to let him go first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll release one and you’ll release one!”</p><p>Said duo Lei.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. You guys let one go? I’ll use the first Prince in exchange for all of you. Do you understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud.</p><p>“All of them? Impossible, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Duo Lei shouted.</p><p>“If you don’t let go, he’ll die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his body exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>Duo Lei’s group grimaced. They were hesitant.</p><p>The first Prince’s status was no small matter. He was the son of the king of the number one royal tribe. He was extremely talented, and his bloodline was the closest to the non-human divine ancestor. He was known as the most talented person in the history of the evil god tribe.</p><p>They couldn’t bear the responsibility of such an identity if he died.</p><p>“Let go or not!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>This was their plan.</p><p>Lu Ming would first exchange the first Prince for Long Chen and the rest. It would be best if the exchange was successful. There would be no risk.</p><p>After all, if they were to fight, the situation would become chaotic. Long Chen and Huang Ling would not be able to fight back, and it would still be risky.</p><p>Duo Lei and the other experts of the evil god tribe were hesitant.</p><p>For a moment, the situation was in a stalemate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the sky cracked open and a terrifying palm stretched out, blasting towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of the palm was terrifying and unstoppable.</p><p>Even a peak heavenly Emperor would be turned into ashes under this palm.</p><p>The war god!</p><p>It was obvious that the divine ancestor of the non-human race had made his move to kill Lu Ming. Even the first Prince was caught up in it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the heavens and earth as a huge Dragon Claw formed and grabbed at the giant hand. With a heaven-shaking roar, the giant hand collapsed and the Dragon Claw retracted.</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared beside duo Lei.</p><p>This figure with long golden hair was the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s figure appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ancestral Dragon, you’ve come!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly. His long golden hair fluttered in the wind, making him look majestic.</p><p>“Mo ke, you’re really ruthless. In order to kill Lu Ming, you don’t even care about the life and death of your descendants?”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>anyway, his cultivation has already been crippled. He’s just a piece of trash. It’s fine if I kill him!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly.</p><p>hehe, Moke, you’re still as cold and ruthless as ever!</p><p>Zu long laughed sarcastically.</p><p>ancestral Dragon, I knew you would show up. All of you from the heaven realm have come. Today, you will stay here forever!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly, and a terrifying aura exploded out.</p><p>buzz…</p><p>Space trembled, and two figures suddenly appeared next to the voice of the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>One was the Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire, and the other was a Supreme elder.</p><p>The two martial gods of the yellow Springs Empire had appeared.</p><p>Moke, do you think I’ll come unprepared? ”</p><p>Zu long sneered, his face calm.</p><p>The next moment, two figures suddenly appeared beside Lu Ming. They were the two martial gods of the netherworld sect.</p><p>“It’s you guys!”</p><p>Seeing the two martial gods of the netherworld sect, the Emperor of the netherworld Empire widened his eyes in surprise.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you two would come out of the mountain even though you claim to be indifferent to the world!”</p><p>The Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire spoke with a faint mocking tone.</p><p>you don’t need to meddle in our business. Longyan, let him go!</p><p>The white-haired old man from the yellow spring sect said.</p><p>Long Yan was the name of the Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to release them!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said with a dark expression.</p><p>Long Yan had once said that the two martial gods of the netherworld sect did not care about worldly affairs. They were old and stubborn, and it was very difficult for them to leave the mountain. He did not expect that they would be with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>In this way, his advantage was gone. How could he be in a good mood? he was so angry that he was about to vomit blood.</p><p>The advantage that he had spent so much effort to gain was gone just like that.</p><p>“Moke, it seems like you want to start a war!”</p><p>Zulong said. The Dragon power on his body was getting stronger and stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
