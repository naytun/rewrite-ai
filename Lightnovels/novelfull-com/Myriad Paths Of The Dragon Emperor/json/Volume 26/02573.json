They all called him a small chiliocosm and called him a native.</p><p>However, this man with messy hair knew about the heaven realm. Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>“Because I’m also from the heaven realm!”</p><p>The man with messy hair smiled.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This was really beyond his expectations.</p><p>to be exact. I’m from the heaven realm. However, I left the heaven realm during the immemorial age. I don’t know how many years have pa.s.sed since then!</p><p>The messy-haired man sighed.</p><p>he should be someone who reached the demiG.o.d realm during the archaic Era!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Before the ancient times, anyone who had reached the demiG.o.d realm would leave the heaven realm and come to the desolate universe to make a breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to meet someone from the heaven realm here. This might be the reason why the other party had killed the one-horned man and the burly elder.</p><p>Lu Ming’s wariness was slightly relaxed.</p><p>“I’m song mo!”</p><p>“I heard that many years ago, the pa.s.sage between the heaven realin and the dark underworld star was scaled. How did you get out?” the man introduced himself.</p><p>“You don’t know what happened recently?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Song mo shook his head and said, “I’ve received an order. The young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long, was secretly kidnapped by someone. We’re responsible for finding the person who kidnapped Kang long, It was only when I saw you that I could sense the aura on you. You have a strong aura of the heaven realm. I’ll never forget it for the rest of my life!</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“It’s like this…</p><p>Then, Lu Ming briefly recounted what had happened in the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm.</p><p>I see. I didn’t expect so many things to happen in the heaven realm. Alas, it’s a pity that we can’t protect the heaven realm in the end!</p><p>Song mo sighed.</p><p>“Senior, why did you join the yuanluo Palace when they treated the heaven realm like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. This was also something that he found strange. Therefore, he was still wary of song mo.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>“It’s all because of the yuan Luo Palace… Song mo sighed.</p><p>the yuanluo Palace used the heaven realm and the primordial realm as ranches and used human divine. beasts as medicinal herbs to refine medicine. I only found out about this after I left the heaven realm! furthermore, in the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d World, any figure who has reached the demiG.o.d realm will be controlled by the origin net Palace once they leave and arrive on the underworld star. Their souls will be heavily restricted, and they can only listen to their orders. Otherwise, they will suffer a fate worse than death!</p><p>As she said this, song Mo’s eyes revealed a hint of ferocity.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, it’s actually like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming also shouted coldly.</p><p>since ancient times, almost all the demiG.o.ds that walked out of the heaven realm and the primordial realm were controlled by the origin net Palace and became their slaves, Death Warriors, if there’s any danger, let us do it. If things don’t go well, they can control the restrictions and torture us!</p><p>as for us, we can’t escape at all. Once we leave a certain range of the yuanluo Palace, the restriction will activate, and we’ll be better off dead!</p><p>Song mo said again. Towards the end, she was filled with helplessness and desolation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>He could understand song Mo’s feelings.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm, they had reached the demiG.o.d realm and were almost at the peak. They had come to the primal universe with great ambition, wanting to break through to a higher realm. However, in reality, they had become the slaves of the yuan Luo Palace. How sad was this?</p><p>you must be cultivating the nomological system, right? I’ve met a few demiG.o.ds who walked out of the heaven realm and cultivated the nomological system. They cultivated a small world, but once they came to the primeval universe, their small world would merge with the primeval universe after a year!</p><p>“You have to escape from the underworld star within a year. Otherwise, you will definitely be found by the</p><p>experts of the origin Luo Palace!”</p><p>Song mo said.</p><p>“Senior, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“There are only two ways to leave the underworld star. One is to take the s.p.a.ce teleportation formation, and the other is to take the s.p.a.ce Battleship!”</p><p>“But now, everyone on the entire planet is looking for you, and the teleportation arrays are being guarded by terrifying experts. If you go, you will be discovered!”</p><p>as for the Starship, it’s extremely precious and rare. I don’t have one either!</p><p>Song mo also frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent. The current situation was really not good.</p><p>He had originally wanted to go to the teleportation formation to try and see if he could sneak through it. But now, the other party could capture the heaven realm aura on him. If he went, he would only be walking into a</p><p>trap and die.</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>“Now, I can only try my luck!”</p><p>Song mo said suddenly after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Try my luck?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Song mo nodded and said, ” over the years, most of the demiG.o.ds from our heaven realm have been controlled by the yuanluo Palace. However, one person managed to escape from the control of the yuanluo Palace. You might have heard of him. The people of the heaven realm call him the ancestor of technique!</p><p>“Ancestor of technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He had naturally heard of the ancestor of technique. He was a legendary figure in the heaven realm,</p><p>The ancestor of technique was a rare genius.</p><p>At the end of the primordial era, the ancestor of technique came out of nowhere and created the nomological cultivation system. He also allowed the nomological cultivation system to expand rapidly. In the end, the nomological cultivation system even defeated the primordial cultivation system and became the mainstream cultivation system in the heaven realm.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s entire life could be written into a legend. Later on, when the ancestor of technique’s cultivation reached the demiG.o.d level, he left the heaven realm. The heavenly realm’s Heavenly Thunder Emperor was one of the ancestor of technique’s disciples. “The ancestor of technique broke away from the control of the yuanluo Palace and took risks to train outside. In the end, he stepped into the true G.o.d Realm and returned to the chaotic astral River. He established a force</p><p>and gathered many experts to fight against the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>Song mo said. Lu Ming nodded. Anyone from the heaven realm would want to destroy the yuanluo Palace after knowing the truth. It was normal for them to fight with the yuanluo Palace after they had successfully cultivated the nomological laws.</p><p>“All these years, the ancestor of technique’s power has been growing stronger and stronger, and he has been</p><p>fighting against the origin Luo Palace for a long time. There is a stellar iron mine on the underworld star that produces precious stellar iron. Some time ago, I heard that someone from the ancestor of technique’s power attacked that stellar iron mine.”</p><p>If you go to the stellar iron mine and are lucky enough to meet the people from the ancestor of technique’s</p><p>force, you can leave the darkness star with them. This is the only way now!”</p><p>“You take this!”</p><p>Song mo waved her hand and a jade talisman flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and took it. He scanned it with his spiritual senses and realized that it was a huge map. “This is the map of the dark underworld star. Follow the map on it and you will be able to accurately find the location of the stellar iron ore. I can’t stay with you for too long, or else I will be easily exposed!”</p><p>Song mo said.</p><p>Swipe left to continue &gt;</p><p>.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
