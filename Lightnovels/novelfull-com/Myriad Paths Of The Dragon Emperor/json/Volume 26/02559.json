Everyone’s doubts were answered but no one was happy. There was only heaviness and anger!</p><p>“Kill! At most, we’ll charge out and fight to the death with that whatever yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>“Right, kill our way out. Even if we die, we must kill to our heart’s content!”</p><p>Many hot-tempered people started to shout. Zu long raised his hand, and everyone quieted down.</p><p>“Tight? How should we fight?”</p><p>Zu long shook his head and sighed, do you know how strong the yuan Luo Palace is?” The evil G.o.d tribe can’t even compare to them!”</p><p>I can tell you that I, prison Guardian patriarch, sacred ancestor bloodheart, and the non-human sacred ancestor were all once from the yuanluo Palace. We were just ordinary guards in the palace, and there were thousands of guards like us!</p><p>Iiss hiss hiss…</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s words caused everyone to gasp.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, the prison-guarding patriarch, and the non-human divine ancestor were all martial G.o.ds. In the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm, they were like myths and G.o.ds!</p><p>However, such an existence was only an ordinary guard in the yuanluo Palace, and there were thousands of such guards.</p><p>How could they fight this?</p><p>The other party could just send in a few martial G.o.ds and destroy them.</p><p>The primal universe was also known as the divine realm.</p><p>The divine realm, as its name suggested, was the world of G.o.ds.</p><p>the four of us were sent here by the yuanluo Palace to guard this place. To put it bluntly, we were sent here because we were weak. Therefore, it’s very difficult for us to resist the yuanluo Palace. However, a small chiliocosm is still a small chiliocosm. It’s too weak, so terrifying experts can’t enter. Once they enter, the small chiliocosm will collapse. Therefore, it’s not like we have no hope!</p><p>Zu long said.</p><p>However, most of the people looked desperate.</p><p>They couldn’t imagine how they would fight against a force with thousands of martial G.o.ds.</p><p>alright, I’ve told you all that. I need to. You can go back and do what you need to do. If the people from the yuan Luo Palace come, we’ll just fight them!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>that’s right. At most, we’ll just fight. If we dic, then we die!</p><p>Some people shouted.</p><p>More people sighed.</p><p>Originally, they had been extremely happy and excited after defeating the evil G.o.d tribe. Who would have thought that an even more powerful and terrifying enemy would appear?</p><p>This kind of situation truly made people despair!</p><p>Most of the people left with heavy hearts!</p><p>Lu Ming did not leave. He asked Xic nianging and the rest to go back first. He stayed behind because he still had questions to ask the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Not long after, everyone left, leaving only Lu Ming and the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming, I know you still have some questions. What do you want to know?”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>senior, I’m indeed confused. Since the yuanluo Palace has so many experts and the non-human divine ancestor could break the heaven suppressing seal, why don’t the experts of the yuanluo Palace break it from the outside?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. The seal of heaven suppression was obtained from an ancient ruin, It’s extremely powerful, and once it’s sealed from the inside of the heaven realm, it can mobilize the power of the entire heaven realm. It’s difficult for ordinary martial G.o.ds to break from the outside, but a stronger martial G.o.d can break it from the outside!</p><p>however, small chiliocosm is fragile. Once it is forcefully broken, the entire heaven realm will be destroyed. The yuanluo Palace is reluctant to do so. What they want most is to destroy us and open it from the inside. This way, the heaven realm and the primordial realm can still become their breeding ground for ‘medicinal herbs”!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>This answer made Lu Ming feel rather helpless. The other party did not attack because they were afraid of destroying the heaven. If the other party was ruthless, they might destroy the heaven at any time. Their destinies were not in their control.</p><p>the yuanluo Palace will definitely not send anyone too strong in, but I’m afraid they’ll send someone below the third level of the void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Zu long said.</p><p>“Ethereal G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>yes, this is the division of the martial G.o.d Realm. Generally, those who have just become a martial G.o.d are in the void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Zu long nodded.</p><p>“Is there any realm above the void G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Yes. Above the ethereal G.o.d Realm, there’s the true G.o.d Realm, heavenly G.o.d Realm, and King G.o.d Realm. Each realm is divided into nine levels!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Ethereal G.o.d Realm, true G.o.d Realm, heavenly G.o.d Realm, and King G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. It turned out that there were still many realms above the martial G.o.d Realm. He still had a long way to go.</p><p>Although he was very strong now, he was only standing at the peak of the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm. However, the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm were just one of the endless small chiliocosm. They were nothing compared to the primeval universe.</p><p>those above the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm are too powerful. If their divine power surges, it’s casy to break open a place like the heaven realm. Therefore, they’ll most likely send those below the third level of the void G.o.d Realm in!</p><p>however, those below the third level of the void G.o.d Realm will definitely be attacked by the heaven suppressing seal and get injured. So, we might have a chance. However, we still have to be careful. The gap between each level of the void G.o.d Realm is huge. It’s not something that the heavenly Emperor realm can compare with!</p><p>as for me, the divine ancestor of the non-human race, Zhenyu, and murderer Xin, we’re all at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. Lu Ming, although you’re a one-star Celestial Emperor and can fight a first level void G.o.d Realm existence, even if you’ve broken through to the two-star Celestial Emperor realm, I don’t think you can fight a second level void G.o.d Realm existence. Do you understand?”</p><p>Zu long warned him seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was very easy to understand.</p><p>In the void G.o.d Realm, the gap between cach level was even greater than that of a beavenly Emperor. Even if he had broken through to the two-star heavenly Emperor realm, the increase in his strength was not as great as the void G.o.d Realm. Therefore, he was afraid that he would not be a match for a second level void G.o.d.</p><p>Of course, this was under the condition that he didn’t trigger the battle formula that doubled his combat.</p><p>power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go back and cultivate. I’ll stay here and inform you immediately if there’s any movement!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Alright!’</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and turned to leave. Ile returned to the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>At this moment, many people had already gathered at the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>Xie nianqing, the dragon and the phoenix spirits were all there.</p><p>However, many of them looked solemn, The ancestral Dragon’s words were like a stone that pressed down on</p><p>their hearts.</p><p>Lu Ming chatted with the crowd for a while before they dispersed and went to cultivate.</p><p>No matter what kind of enemy he had to face, the most important thing was to improve himself.</p><p>Lu Ming entered a secret room and sat cross-legged. He then moved his hand and the great desolation spear</p><p>appeared in his hand.</p><p>One could see that the great desolation spear was filled with holes. Its spirituality had been greatly reduced and it was already half destroyed.</p><p>“A divine artifact is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Previously, he had used the great desolation spear to clash head-on with the non-human divine ancestor, and the great desolation spear had been destroyed.</p><p>After a few glances. Lu Ming put away the great desolation spear and a combat sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>£3</p><p>Sund Gift</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
