For example, venerable sovereign ni Luan’s life essence was injured, and it was not easy to recover.</p><p>Of course, some of the older Kings of the evil G.o.d race had also been injured in the battle back then. Over the years, the evil G.o.d race had used up almost all of their top-notch natural treasures to allow these old Kings of the evil G.o.d race to recover.</p><p>However, the evil G.o.d tribe occupied the entire evil G.o.d World and the eight heaven domains of the heaven realm. With such a vast territory, they would naturally have many treasures.</p><p>However, in the heaven realm, there was only the Tai Qing heaven region left. The natural treasures were very limited, but now, these half-G.o.ds in the heaven realm were actually all at their peak.</p><p>They really couldn’t figure it out!</p><p>They were both shocked and furious!</p><p>This time, many things had already exceeded their expectations.</p><p>For example, the world G.o.d turtle, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the nine lives devilish silkworm, who were among the top ten Battle Beasts, had become demiG.o.ds. There were also the old demiG.o.ds in the heaven realm who had recovered to their peak state. All of these were things that they had not expected.</p><p>If they knew that this was caused by the life fruit that Lu Ming brought out from the netherworld Island, be wondered what kind of expressions they would have.</p><p>In the evil G.o.d World, the non-human divine ancestor’s expression was also very ugly. He looked into the distance, as if he could see through the endless void.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon also looked at the evil G.o.d race, as if he was looking at the non-human race’s divine ancestor. Both of their eyes shone with a bright light.</p><p>ancestral Dragon, do you think you can win? this time, the heaven realm is destined to be destroyed. All your efforts will be in vain!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly.</p><p>His voice actually directly penetrated the endless void, from the evil G.o.d Realm to the heaven realm, and into the ears of the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>This kind of skill was simply inconceivable.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t you know that those who commit injustice are doomed to destruction?”</p><p>&Nbsp; zu long also spoke and his voice spread to the evil G.o.d World.</p><p>hahaha, ancestral Dragon, you’ve lived for such a long time, and you still believe in such nonsense. Ridiculous, ridiculous!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor sneered.</p><p>He faced the ancestral Dragon from afar and controlled everything on the battlefield.</p><p>On the battlefield of the ruins of end and the battlefield of two world city, the fighting was extremely fierce.</p><p>The two sides could be said to have turned out in full strength, and it was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>This battle lasted for a full seven days!</p><p>Countless powerhouses from both sides had already fallen on this battlefield.</p><p>Countless emperors-to-be, illusionary emperors, true emperors, and great emperors were killed or injured.</p><p>Even many of the heavenly Emperor realm cultivators had died in battle.</p><p>On the battlefield of two world city, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others were covered in blood. Wounds appeared on their bodies, and they looked terrifying.</p><p>They had fought for seven days, but they were still alive. It was all thanks to their cultivation of the indestructible ancient scroll and the consumption of the life fruit that they were able to hold on. Otherwise, they would have died.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! they roared and continued to kill their way toward the evil G.o.d race with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>Over the past few days, they had seen countless heaven realm experts die in battle. Some of them were people they knew, but now, they would forever remain</p><p>this land.</p><p>Now, the only way to resolve this crisis was to kill them all.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor murmured. He then waved his hand, and a voice transmission jade talisman flew out.</p><p>Not long after, a terrifying Army set out, heading towards the battlefield of two world city.</p><p>The evil G.o.d tribe’s heaven crushing Army had finally moved out!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, who was far away in the heaven realm, also sensed it.</p><p>“I hope it can be blocked!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon muttered and then sent out another piece of news.</p><p>On the battlefield of two world city, everyone was fighting.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar came from the distance, and then everyone saw a dark cloud charging toward them.</p><p>Another army of 100000 soldiers appeared. Although it was nothing compared to the tens of millions of soldiers on the battlefield, it was still a huge Army.</p><p>However, the aura it emitted was terrifying and made everyone tremble in fear.</p><p>“Kill!’</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sky breaking Army roared as a hundred thousand strong Army surged towards the battlefield like a flood. Their cold killing intent made it hard for anyone to breathe.</p><p>“It’s the sky breaking Army!”</p><p>‘Let’s Move!”</p><p>The members of the evil G.o.d race recognized this legendary Army and immediately stepped aside, making way for the heaven crushing Army.</p><p>The sky-breaking Army directly charged at the heavenly realm Army.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>100,000 attacks burst out from the sky-breaking Army and rushed toward the heaven realm Army. Suddenly, the heaven realm Army was killed one by one, and tens of thousands of people died in an instant.</p><p>“What’s going on? It’s so terrifying”</p><p>The Army of the heaven realm was shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sky breaking Army was too strong. Wherever they pa.s.sed, they destroyed everything as casily as breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, causing countless deaths and injuries.</p><p>d.a.m.n it! The evil G.o.d tribe actually has such an Army!</p><p>In the sky, many heavenly emperors were shocked.</p><p>Some of the heavenly emperors attacked the sky-breaking Army, but some of the sky-breaking Army’s people attacked the heavenly emperors, killing them.</p><p>Terrifying, it was truly terrifying. Even a heavenly Emperor was killed in an instant.</p><p>you actually want to attack the sky breaking Army? you’re overestimating yourself!</p><p>Some of the evil G.o.d race’s celestial thearchs sneered.</p><p>The heaven crushing Army was the most terrifying Army in the evil G.o.d tribe’s ancient legends!</p><p>There were only 100000 people in the Army, but they were all experts above the great emperor realm.</p><p>Among them, there were 5000 who were above the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>95,000 great sovereigns and 5000 celestial emperors, what a powerful force this was.</p><p>“It’s the sky breaking Army!”</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The expressions of the demiG.o.ds from the heaven realm changed drastically.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>At this moment, the commander of the sky breaking Army gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, the 100000 soldiers of the heaven breaking Army began to form a large array.</p><p>Some of them flew into the sky while others landed on the ground. They were arranged in a strange formation, and their auras intersected with each other. Their powers fused together, and an incomparably huge giant appeared between the heavens and the earth.</p><p>The giant was so huge that it was several times bigger than the giant beard tribe.</p><p>Some of the 100000 soldiers of the heaven crushing Army were at the head of the giant, while others were at the limbs. The power of the heaven crushing Army was gathered to form this giant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This giant stepped out, covering the sky and the sun, and stomped towards the heavenly realm Army.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others were within the range of the giant’s foot. The pressure was too terrifying and irresistible. Once the giant stepped on them, they would be turned into ashes.</p><p>“Are we going to die Here?”</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others could not help but have this thought.</p><p>However, at this moment, transparent bubbles suddenly appeared on their bodies and enveloped them. Then,</p><p>their bodies trembled and they disappeared.</p><p>BOOM! The giant. foot stomped down, and thousands of heaven realm powerhouses turned into ashes.</p><p>100,000 miles away, Long Chen and the others appeared, their faces pale.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
