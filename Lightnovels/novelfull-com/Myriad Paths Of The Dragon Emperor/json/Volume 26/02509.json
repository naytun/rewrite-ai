Even if he gave it his all, he was only equivalent to a six-star heavenly Emperor. There was a huge difference between him and a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was severely injured and had no strength to fight back.</p><p>“Am I going to die Here today?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>He was unwilling, extremely unwilling.</p><p>At the same time, he was worried about Xie nianqing, Lu Xiangxiang, and the others.</p><p>He had encountered such a difficult and dangerous situation. What about Xie nianqing and the others?</p><p>He was unwilling to give up and wanted to resist. He desperately urged the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. However, there was a force between heaven and earth that was too strong and completely suppressed the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The magma giant landed beside Lu Ming and looked down at him.</p><p>“You are too weak!”</p><p>The magma giant opened his mouth. The magma on his body flowed, and his expression could not be seen at all.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then kill me. If you want to humiliate me, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you now!”</p><p>The magma giant seemed to smile and continued, ” “I won’t kill you now, but that doesn’t mean I won’t kill you in the future. I’ll give you a chance now. I’ll give you 50 years!”</p><p>“You can only stay on this Island for the next fifty years. You have to find a way to defeat me. If you can’t defeat me after fifty years, I’ll kill you and destroy your soul. Do you understand?”</p><p>After saying that, the magma giant turned around and left. Not long after, he disappeared from this place.</p><p>“Giving me 50 years, is this a test?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the indestructible ancient scroll with all his might to begin healing.</p><p>Although his injuries were severe, they did not harm his core. Under the effect of the indestructible ancient scroll, he recovered quickly. Not long after, Lu Ming was fully recovered.</p><p>if I want to defeat the magma giant within 50 years, my combat strength must be at least stronger than an ordinary peak heavenly Emperor!</p><p>After his injuries were healed, Lu Ming had to think about this problem.</p><p>Fifty years might seem long, but to ordinary people, it would pass in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It would be difficult to surpass an ordinary peak heavenly Emperor in 50 years!</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current situation, there were only two ways for his combat strength to surpass that of an ordinary peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The first was a physical breakthrough!</p><p>Lu Ming had now cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the sixth stage. His physical strength was equivalent to a four-star heavenly Emperor, or he might be able to suppress an ordinary four-star heavenly Emperor. As long as he cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the late stage of the sixth stage, his physical strength would skyrocket and he would be equivalent to a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>In addition to the power of the way of domination, Lu Ming was confident that he could defeat the lava giant.</p><p>However, it would be extremely difficult to improve the seven Gods mysterious technique after he had cultivated it to this level.</p><p>If he were to cultivate step by step, it would be normal for him to spend tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>The experts among the immemorial body cultivators took a long time to break through each step.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming had broken through so quickly previously was that he had too many opportunities. He had obtained various rare treasures one after another. Each of those treasures was a rare treasure in the world.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body broke through one after another after refining such a treasure.</p><p>If Lu Ming cultivated step by step, his physical state would not be able to reach his current level.</p><p>It was almost impossible to cultivate his physical body to the level of a peak heavenly Emperor within 50 years.</p><p>The second path was to cultivate the ruler Dao to peak Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s path of domination was too powerful. It could allow him to cross an entire realm. As long as he cultivated the path of domination to the peak great emperor realm, Lu Ming’s combat strength would be equivalent to that of a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Then, with the strength of his physical body, he could defeat the lava giant.</p><p>However, to reach peak Emperor in fifty years was even more difficult than breaking through to the physical body.</p><p>The higher the realm, the more difficult it was to break through.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had been able to break through continuously because he had comprehended the Dominator’s will on the statue. However, it had taken him decades.</p><p>Now, it was even more impossible for him to comprehend it on his own and break through within 50 years.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had to do it.</p><p>Lu Ming had no doubt that if he could not defeat the other party fifty years later, he would definitely be killed by the other party.</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>this must be a test. If it wasn’t, he could have killed me right now!</p><p>since it’s a test, there must be a chance of survival. By the way, the serpentman said that there are some opportunities on some islands. Perhaps there are similar opportunities on this Island that can help me break through!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he began to search the island.</p><p>The island was not very big. It had a radius of several thousand miles. Very soon, Lu Ming had searched through it.</p><p>There was nothing!</p><p>There was no vegetation or life on this Island. There were only flames and only one lava lake. The temperature was terrifyingly high, at least a dozen times, or even a hundred times higher than the outside.</p><p>“There’s nothing here. How am I supposed to break through?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in deep thought.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent explosion was heard again. The huge lava giant had come again.</p><p>“Brat, do you think you can defeat me just by standing here in a daze? I’ll hammer you!”</p><p>The lava giant roared. Its arm turned into a huge lava hammer and smashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t think that I’m easy to bully!”</p><p>Lu Ming was furious and fought with the other party.</p><p>However, after a few moves, Lu Ming was beaten to the ground and was seriously injured.</p><p>“I just thinkyou’re easy to bully, so what? If you have the ability, hit me!”</p><p>The magma giant called out in a very annoying manner. After that, he laughed and left.</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>All along, he had been the one suppressing others. This time, he was suppressed by a stupid big guy. He was really depressed.</p><p>no, I must break through within 50 years. I can’t die Here!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze became determined and he started to heal his injuries.</p><p>After his injuries were healed, Lu Ming began to comprehend The Way of the Master.</p><p>While Lu Ming was cultivating, the lava giant did not come to deal with him.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time, and in the blink of an eye, a year had passed.</p><p>In the past year, Lu Ming had focused on cultivating the path of domination, but he had little to no gains and his progress was slow.</p><p>“No, I can’t reach peak Emperor in fifty years if this continues!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>Even if he were to spend a few times more time on it, he would still be unable to comprehend it step by step like this.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was already high enough. If it was someone else, if they did not have the opportunity and cultivated step by step, they would not be able to do it even after fifty thousand years, let alone fifty years.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the magma giant appeared again after a year.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he raised his fist and smashed it down.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was no match for the other party. Very soon, he was severely injured.</p><p>“Brat, you haven’t improved at all. I thinkyou’ll be dead in 50 years!”</p><p>The lava giant left after saying this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
