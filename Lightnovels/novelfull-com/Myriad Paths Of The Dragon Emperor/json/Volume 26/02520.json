After a while, he said, ” in fact, we’ve already obtained seven fruits. Five is enough for me to heal my injuries. However, in the ancient war, many experts of the heaven realm were seriously injured and their life essence was damaged. It has been so many years that they can’t recover. These fruits of life can be given to them. This way, the strength of the heaven realm can be greatly improved!</p><p>“Then it’s all up to senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He gave these fruits of life to zu long for the same reason.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve done a great service for the heaven realm this time. If you have any requests, just tell us!”</p><p>Zu long smiled.</p><p>“Senior, I really do have a question to ask. What is 10000 Yuan return to one?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“10000 Yuan return to one?”</p><p>Zu long sized Lu Ming up and asked, ” “Your cultivation has already reached this stage, right? show it to me!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. His muscles trembled and his qi and blood churned like a dragon. His aura was shocking.</p><p>This was the power of the physical body!</p><p>Then, his body glowed with a dazzling purple-gold light. Lu Ming’s Dao of domination was unleashed to the extreme.</p><p>“Good,good, good!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s face was filled with excitement and he said ” good ”</p><p>three times.</p><p>He could sense that Lu Ming’s cultivation was extremely powerful. Now that he had confirmed it, he could not hide his excitement.</p><p>His physical body was a peak heavenly Emperor, and his Dao of domination had also reached an astonishing level. It was simply a miracle that he was so young.</p><p>He understood that he had underestimated Lu Ming. Lu Ming had most likely obtained unimaginable opportunities in this trip to the netherworld world world.</p><p>However, the stronger Lu Ming was, the better it was for the heaven realm. He was happier.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must have reached a bottleneck in your cultivation!</p><p>Zu long asked.</p><p>“That’s right, please give me some pointers, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>yes. The next step in your path of the physical body is the martial God Realm. If you want to break through to the martial God Realm, you must have some understanding of this realm!</p><p>the martial God Realm is different from all the realms before the martial God Realm. The martial God Realm is known as a God, but it has actually reached another realm. Before the martial God Realm, you can say that it is the first step of cultivation. When you reach the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm, you have completed the first step. The martial God Realm is the second step of cultivation!</p><p>Zu long explained in detail. Lu Ming listened attentively and was shocked at the same time.</p><p>The training before becoming a martial God was only the first step. Becoming a martial God was the second step.</p><p>Didn’t that mean that the second step of cultivation also had many realms? the martial God Realm is very special. It mainly cultivates divine power!</p><p>Zu long said.</p><p>“Shen power?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He thought of the power used by the ancestral Dragon and the divine ancestor of the non-human race. It was extremely powerful. Was that divine power?</p><p>yes, Shen power. But if you want to cultivate Shen power, you have to fuse 10000 elements into one!</p><p>what is loooo elements return to one? it means to mix and merge all powers together, such as laws, wills, great DAOs, heavenly Dao, divine arts, physical power, world power, and so on. No matter what power or system you cultivate, in the end, you have to merge all of them together and transform them into a higher level power, which is divine power!</p><p>only by reaching this step can one step into the martial God Realm. In fact, the so-called unrivaled powerhouses, or demigods, have already reached this step. They have already fused loooo elements into one and ignited a wisp of divine fire in their bodies!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>everything must be United. Then, the small world in my body…</p><p>Lu Ming asked in shock.</p><p>everything must be combined into one and transformed into divine power. Divine power is Supreme and powerful. The power of the world can not withstand a single blow from divine power!</p><p>the way of the God that you’re cultivating will transform into God Power when you step into the martial God Realm. It’s an extremely terrifying divine power!</p><p>Zu long was a little envious when he said this, but it immediately turned into a sigh, unfortunately, it’s impossible for a God to be born in this world!</p><p>“It’s impossible to give birth to a God? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly. He felt that he was about to come into contact with some core secrets.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>Zu long sighed again. After a moment of silence, he said, ” the conditions of the heaven realm, primordial realm, or the evil god Realm can not support the breakthrough of a God. In other words, the conditions are too poor, and the most they can do is cultivate to the demigod realm!</p><p>“You can only cultivate to the demigod level?”</p><p>Lu Ming was at a loss for words. After awhile, he asked again, ” then, senior, you and the foreign race’s divine ancestor…</p><p>you’re just curious about how we reached the martial God Realm, right? that s because we’re not from the heaven realm or the evil god Realm. We came from the outside, and when we came, we were already in the martial God Realm!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was really dumbfounded.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, the divine ancestor, and the other martial gods weren t born in the heaven realm or the evil god tribe. They had come from the outside.</p><p>This was beyond his expectations.</p><p>is it the desolate universe outside? ”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. He recalled some words that Bai Ya had told him.</p><p>“Senior, does that mean that we can go outside and break through?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>Zu long sighed again. After a while of silence, he shook his head and said, ”</p><p>“Now, we can’t get out!”</p><p>“Can’t get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled.</p><p>this matter involves a lot of things, but now is not the time to tell you. I will tell you when I have the chance in the future!</p><p>Zu long shook his head and changed the topic, ” therefore, it’s not suitable for you to cultivate your physical body now. No matter how much you cultivate, you can only reach the demigod realm at most. It won’t have a decisive effect on the overall situation. Now, you must focus on cultivating the path of domination. As long as you break through to the heavenly Emperor realm, you will have the hope of fighting against a martial God. At least, you can do it in the heaven realm!</p><p>Lu Ming collected his thoughts and suppressed the doubts in his heart. He said, senior, when I cultivated the path of a ruler, I always felt that this world was blocking me. It was as if the heavenly Dao was suppressing me. I wonder what was going on? ”</p><p>“That’s normal. This is because the Dao of domination is too domineering! ancestral Dragon said, ” the ruler Dao can rule the world and is extremely domineering. Even outside, it is a rare power. The heaven Dao is afraid!</p><p>“Are you afraid?”</p><p>that’s right. Once you break through to the heavenly Emperor realm, you’ll be able to rule this world with your ruler’s Dao, including the heavenly Dao. That’s why the heavenly Dao is afraid and wants to suppress you and prevent you from breaking through!</p><p>that’s why the heavenly Tribulation was so powerful when you broke through to the martial Supreme realm. It was the heavenly Dao that stopped you!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was enlightened. No wonder it was so difficult for him to break through to the martial Supreme realm. The power of the heavenly Tribulation was beyond his imagination.</p><p>The reason was that the heavenly Dao was afraid!</p><p>Lu Ming was also speechless!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
