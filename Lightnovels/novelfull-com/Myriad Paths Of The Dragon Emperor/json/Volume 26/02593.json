The Minotaur roared and waved his giant axe, heavily chopping at the metal ball.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With an carth-shattering sound, the battle-ax in the Minotaur’s hand bounced back and hit his head. At the same time, the metal ball pressed down and hit the Minotaur’s head.</p><p>The Minotaur let out a blood-curdling screech as his body exploded and he died on the spot.</p><p>When the metal ball was at the first level of the virtual G.o.d Realm, its power was equivalent to the fourth level of the virtual G.o.d Realm. Now that it had advanced, it could fight with a fifth level virtual G.o.d Realm powerhouse. Naturally, it could kill a third level virtual G.o.d Realm powerhouse instantly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The old serpent-man was shocked.</p><p>A third level void G.o.d Realm expert was instantly killed. Even he couldn’t do that!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The serpent-man elder roared and turned to run.</p><p>The remaining few people had long since been scared out of their wits. Before the old serpent-man elder could say anything, they had also fled.</p><p>“Smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the metal ball flew out, smashing towards the old serpent-man. BOOM!</p><p>The metal ball was like a mountain as it crashed toward the old serpent-man elder.</p><p>The serpent-man elder used all his strength to block and blast out attacks, but they were all destroyed by the metal ball.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The serpent-man elder’s palms finally landed on the metal ball. His body trembled violently, and he was sent flying while spitting out blood. Both his arms had been broken.</p><p>Then, the metal ball continued to lly over and smashed down heavily.</p><p>The old serpent-man couldn’t block the metal ball’s attack at all. He tried his best to block a few moves, but he was still killed by the metal ball.</p><p>As for the remaining people, Xie nianging and Xie nianjun had already rushed out. With a flash of their swords, they were all killed.</p><p>The old serpent-man man and the other six had all fallen here.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest looked grave.</p><p>If the bald man from the yuan Luo Palace could inform the old serpent-man, he could also inform the others.</p><p>It would be bad if he encountered a stronger opponent!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After putting away the storage rings of the old serpent-man man and the others, the group left in a flash. However, not long after, they were surrounded again.</p><p>This time, they met the people of Tengyun Hall.</p><p>There were more than 20 people from Fengyun Hall, and two of them were at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>There were also a few fourth level void G.o.d Realm experts, and they were no match for them.</p><p>With the help of the metal ball, they managed to block a few of the other party’s attacks. They then quickly retreated.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving. Hand over that metallic sphere!”</p><p>The leader of the Tengyun Hall was a human elder. His eyes were cold and his cultivation base was at the peak of the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm. He was very powerful and was hot on Lu Ming’s heels.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest. did not take a look and ran at full speed.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The old man from Fengyun Hall struck out with his palm. The force of his palm was like an avalanche as it blasted towards Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Wherever it pa.s.sed, some trees made of metal were constantly blown up and shattered.</p><p>‘Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the metal ball out directly.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a loud boom, the metal ball shook violently and was sent flying back.</p><p>However, the speed of Lu Ming and the rest was not affected at all. They ran at top speed. “You can’t escape!”</p><p>The old man of Fengyun Hall had a ferocious look on his face, and his eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>That metal ball was so magical, and its strength was also extremely shocking. If he could get his hands on it, he would definitely be like a tiger that had grown wings.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the front.</p><p>The roar was shocking. Even from a distance, one could feel a powerful pressure.</p><p>that’s a sixth level void G.o.d Realm metal desolate beast!</p><p>Xic nianjun said.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. They did not slow down at all and rushed straight ahead.</p><p>“You guys… You’re looking for death, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The old man of Fengyun Hall roared.</p><p>even if you’re looking for death, I won’t let you off easily. If you have the ability, then come after me! Lu Ming turned around and shouted in disdain.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The old man of Fengyun Hall roared. He gritted his teeth and continued to chase.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Thunderous roars came from the front. They saw a giant Metal Tiger that was more than ten meters tall.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest approached, they were discovered by the giant Metal Tiger. Its cold gaze swept over Lu Ming and the rest, and they felt a strong pressure.</p><p>A sixth-tier void G.o.d Realm was extremely terrifying. Even if Xie nianging and Xie nianjun joined forces with the metal ball, they would be defeated in an instant.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The metal growler let out a long roar. It took a step forward and the carth shook. It then dashed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>‘I can only take a gamble!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. He did not stop and continued to rush forward.</p><p>At that moment, the metal ball revealed a big mouth and a pair of eyes. It stared at the giant Metal Tiger and opened and closed its big mouth with all its might, making a cracking sound.</p><p>When the giant Metal Tiger saw the metal ball, a trace of fear flashed in its eyes. Then, it twisted its waist, bypa.s.sed Lu Ming and the rest, and rushed toward the people of Fengyun Hall.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it…. Quickly run!”</p><p>The old man of Fengyun Hall shouted, turned around and ran,</p><p>Although he was at peak Lv 5 void G.o.d Realm, he would die if he went up against the giant Metal Tiger that. was at Lv 6 void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The metal desolate beasts on the myriad Gold Star were stronger when fighting against the same level.</p><p>Because they were all made of metal, their defensive power was astonishing, and their vitality was very tenacious. When they fought, they were not afraid of death.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant Metal Tiger roared angrily. It leaped a hundred miles and quickly caught up with the people of Fengyun Hall. Its huge claws swept out and two experts of Tengyun Hall were killed.</p><p>Then, it opened its mouth and bit down. An expert of Tengyun Hall was bitten into two pieces.</p><p>It was simply torture.</p><p>“Ah, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The old man from Fengyun Hall ran the fastest, leading the way. However, he was roaring in his heart.</p><p>He could not figure out why the giant Metal Tiger did not attack Lu Ming and the rest. Instead, it attacked</p><p>them directly.</p><p>He was furious, but now, he could only run.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er, in particular, felt a thin layer of cold sweat all over her body.</p><p>However, they had made the right. bet. The giant. Metal Tiger did not attack them.</p><p>It seemed like the metal ball was effective even against a sixth-level void G.o.d Realm metal desolate beast.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>They didn’t stop and left in a flash.</p><p>After running for a distance, they finally stopped.</p><p>it seems like we can’t keep Wan jinxing alive. I’m afraid that guy from the yuanluo Palace has already spread</p><p>the news!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s leave immediately and return to the true heavenstar!”</p><p>Lu Ming added,</p><p>He had gained a lot of divine crystals after hunting for a while. He could use them for a while if he sold them. Originally, if there was no danger, they had planned to continue hunting desolate beasts on the myriad Gold Star. But now, it was too dangerous to stay on the myriad Gold Star.</p><p>They would be in danger if they encountered a sixth or even seventh level void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
