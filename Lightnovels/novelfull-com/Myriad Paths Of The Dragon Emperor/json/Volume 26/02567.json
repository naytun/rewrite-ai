With fewer people, it was more convenient, to move around.</p><p>“Primal universe, here I come!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and turned to look at the land of the heaven realm.</p><p>After they left, the yuanluo Palace would definitely not destroy the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm. They would definitely let. living beings in and turn them into farms!</p><p>“One day, I will take back this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then stepped into the pa.s.sage and disappeared!</p><p>The primeval universe was vast and boundless. It was a greater world, also known as the divine realm.</p><p>This was the final path for all the experts in the small chiliocosm. After all the living beings in the small chiliocosm cultivated to the demiG.o.d realm, they would leave the small chiliocosm and come to the primal universe.</p><p>There were countless experts and G.o.ds gathered here.</p><p>There were countless stars in the primeval universe, and there were also countless life plancts suitable for living beings to live on. They were divided into countless forces of various sizes.</p><p>The chaotic astral River was a well-known chaotic place in the primal universe. It was a place where countless races and countless extremely evil people gathered.</p><p>In this boundless Galaxy, there were many life planets and forces of different sizes.</p><p>The yuanluo Palace was one of them. It occupied more than a dozen vital plancts and had countless experts. Kang long was the young master of the yuanluo Palace. He was very talented and had reached the demiG.o.d realm at a young age. Ile was highly regarded by the palace Master of the yuanluo Palace and was given a life planet as his territory,</p><p>This life planet was the dark underworld star!</p><p>The underworld star was extremely huge. Half of it was a continent, while the other half was an occan.</p><p>Its territory was not something that the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm could compare to. Even if the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm were all added together, their area would not even be one ten-thousandth of the size of the planet.</p><p>In the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm, they were small chiliocosm attached to the shadowed star, and their pa.s.sages were connected to the planet.</p><p>It was a vast mountain. On one of the peaks, Kang long sat on a chair. Two young women were ma.s.saging his shoulders.</p><p>“Is there still no news of that small world?”</p><p>Kang long asked.</p><p>He had a bald head with some black runes on it. He was very similar to one of the burly men who had entered the heaven realm before. They were from the same race.</p><p>“Young master, there’s still no news!”</p><p>An old man bowed and reported.</p><p>“You’re really useless. You’ve been in there for more than ten days and there’s still no news. Even a small chiliocosm took such a long time. I’ve really raised you for nothing!”</p><p>Kang duo’s face darkened.</p><p>On the side, other than the old man, there were two other burly men. However, at this moment, they were all silent, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>“Give them one more month. If there’s still no news after one month, you guys can attack and destroy that small chiliocosm. It’s just a small chiliocosm, I don’t want it anymore!”</p><p>Kang long said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>On the side, the others nodded.</p><p>Suddenly, a voice came from afar</p><p>“Young master, there’s movement in the small world!”</p><p>A skinny young man, who was not much older than Kang long, flew over and said.</p><p>there’s movement. Su tu and the others have probably settled it. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Kang long took the lead and flew forward. The others followed.</p><p>There was a Valley in front of them. In the valley, there was a huge black Vortex that was constantly spinning.</p><p>When Kang long and the rest arrived, they heard rumbling sounds coming from the Black Vortex.</p><p>Not long after, the sound disappeared.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Kang long and the others ‘eyes flickered as they saw a figure appear from the vortex.</p><p>Then, the figure slowly became clear.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Kang long and the others were stunned.</p><p>This was because they didn’t recognize the figure. He wasn’t one of the people they had sent out. Instead, he</p><p>was a young man in his twenties. He was handsome and had a straight posture.</p><p>This young man was naturally Lu Ming who had come from the heaven realm!</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Kang long saw that it was not one of his men and waved his hand. At once, the five or six burly men who were guarding the place moved and surrounded Lu Ming, exuding a shocking aura.</p><p>“Ethereal G.o.d Realm, they’re all ethereal G.o.d Realm. And they’re all at level two or three of ethereal G.o.d Realm!’</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>This</p><p>troublesome!</p><p>These people’s cultivation levels were too high. Among the six burly men surrounding Lu Ming, he could sense that at least two of them were not weaker than su tu and were third level void G.o.d Realm powerhouses. The other four were also at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>As for the young man not far away, Lu Ming could tell at a glance that he was a demiG.o.d.</p><p>However, the two burly men and the old man behind the young man were unfathomable. It was impossible to estimate their exact cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank. Such power was not something he could contend with.</p><p>In the heaven realm, Lu Ming could rule the heaven realm’s primordial realm and the evil G.o.d Realm. He could directly mobilize the energy of the heaven realm’s primordial realm and the evil G.o.d Realm. Therefore, he could casily kill third level void G.o.d Realm existences.</p><p>However, after leaving the heaven realm and coming to the primeval universe, Lu Ming naturally could not</p><p>mobilize the energy of the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming’s combat strength was doubled, he would not be a match for a third level void G.o.d-level. Not to mention, there were even stronger existences.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not sit still and wait for death. He instinctively released his aura and was on guard. “Only at the transformation void martial stage?”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s aura, not only was Kang long stunned, but the others were as well. Then, one by one, they relaxed and revealed relaxed expressions.</p><p>Ile was only at the transformation void martial stage. Any one of them could suppress him with a flip of their hand. What was there to be nervous about?</p><p>Initially, they had thought that Lu Ming was a great expert.</p><p>Everyone’s expressions fell into Lu Ming’s cyes. He had an idea.</p><p>“A transformation void martial stage, kid, did you secretly run out?”</p><p>Kang long asked coldly.</p><p>He thought that Lu Ming must have sneaked out when su tu and the rest were not prepared.</p><p>“That’s right. What do you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended that his expression had changed drastically. He retreated continuously, looking nervous.</p><p>‘He really sneaked out!”</p><p>Kang long sneered,” “Let me ask you, how are the people who entered your world? What are you doing?”</p><p>those detestable guys are ma.s.sacring, They’re killing innocents. They’re simply inhumane…</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be furious. He was extremely furious.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Kang long and the rest laughed.</p><p>forget it, let them play. Kid, kneel down and surrender. I have something to ask you!</p><p>Kang long waved his hand.</p><p>you want me to surrender? dream on. I am the number one heaven’s pride in the heaven realm. I can see</p><p>that you are not old. I challenge you now. Do you dare to accept my challenge? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>How dare you! What qualifications do you have to challenge the young master? you’re just an ant! I’ll kill you</p><p>with one palm!</p><p>One f the burly men said ferociously.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Kang long waved his hand and stopped the burly man.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
