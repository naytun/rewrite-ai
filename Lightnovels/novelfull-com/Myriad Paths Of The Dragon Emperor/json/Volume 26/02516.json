With his current cultivation, facing Bai Ya was like an ant facing an elephant. He had no way of resisting.</p><p>Terrifying, extremely terrifying!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s feeling. He had a feeling that if white teeth wanted to attack him, he could kill him with a snap of his fingers. This was something that neither the ancestral Dragon nor the non-human race’s divine ancestor felt.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more shocked!</p><p>An existence like white tooth had actually been sealed here, unable to leave for generations.</p><p>Also, the owner of the White teeth, Jing Yu, was definitely even more powerful.</p><p>Yet, he was killed by someone. How powerful must their enemy be?</p><p>Also, there were many Cursed Lands in netherworld mountain. Were they also the means of their enemies?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>however, there is always a way out. There is always a chance of survival in the dark. Every ten thousand years, the seal of netherworld mountain will loosen, and you people from the outside world can come in!</p><p>we’ve been looking for a suitable candidate to inherit master’s legacy.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are only a few people who come in from the outside every time, and those with great talent are extremely rare. We’ve been waiting for a long time, and you’ve finally come!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“Senior, if you want me to inherit senior Jing Yu’s legacy, there should be some requirements, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bai Ya looked at Lu Ming with admiration.”You’re very smart. Not bad, you do have a request!”</p><p>I can tell you that master was framed and wronged by others back then. He died with injustice, and his bloodline is forever sealed here. Therefore, if you want to inherit master’s inheritance, you must swear on your life source that you will avenge master in the future, clear his injustice, and save us!</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming knew that it was not simple.</p><p>“Senior, given your cultivation level or senior Jingyu’s, how can I do it if I’m not his match?” Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>you may not be able to do it now, but it doesn’t mean you won’t be able to do it in the future. There’s no time limit for this matter. With your talent, you might be able to surpass master in the future. Although this is difficult, there s still some hope!</p><p>I can tell you that what you’ve obtained and comprehended before is only one part of master’s inheritance. If you can obtain master’s inheritance, you’ll be able to avoid many detours in the future!</p><p>Bai Ya started to tempt Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>The owner of the White fangs, Jing Yu, was obviously a terrifying existence. His cultivation had exceeded Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>There would definitely be great danger in avenging such a person.</p><p>However, Lu Ming immediately thought of the evil god tribe.</p><p>If the non-human race’s divine ancestor and the bloodheart divine ancestor were to recover, he probably wouldn’t even be able to get past the evil god tribe. Everyone in the heaven realm would have to die, including his family and friends.</p><p>As for agreeing to Bai Ya’s request to avenge Jing Yu, that was something that would happen many years later. Even if he failed, he would be the only one to die.</p><p>Furthermore, if he could obtain the inheritance of an existence on Jing Yu’s level, he might have a way to fight against the evil god race.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming had already made a decision.</p><p>“Alright, senior, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>you’re right! Bai Ya was overjoyed and said, ” however, you still have to swear on your life source!</p><p>Swearing on life source was completely different from a blood oath.</p><p>A martial Supreme could already resist a blood oath.</p><p>However, if one were to make an oath on one’s life force origin and use it directly on one’s life force origin, even a martial God would find it difficult to resist it, let alone a martial Supreme. If one were to break the oath, they would be subject to terrible punishment.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming followed Bai Ya’s request and swore the life origin oath.</p><p>“Senior, I still don’t know who senior Jingyu’s enemy is.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>They didn’t even know who their enemy was, so how could they take revenge?</p><p>“Do you know about the great void Holy dynasty?”</p><p>Bai Ya asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Great void Holy dynasty? I’ve never heard of it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“Haven’t you heard? It’s normal that you haven’t heard of it. Those fellows must have sealed us in a very remote place. You should have heard of the boundless Galaxy, right?”</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“The boundless Galaxy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more dumbfounded.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of the boundless Galaxy either, but what about the primal universe? You should have heard of it, right?”</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head vigorously.</p><p>“You haven’t even heard of the primal universe?”</p><p>Bai Ya was dumbfounded. He looked at Lu Ming, tongue-tied.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. He had really not heard of it. Could it be that not hearing of it was a very embarrassing thing?</p><p>where did those guys seal us? we haven’t even heard of the primeval universe.</p><p>No wonder so few geniuses have entered in the past few years!</p><p>ruthless. Those guys are really ruthless. They want us to never be able to make a comeback!</p><p>White teeth’s face was gloomy as he gritted his teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming was very smart and did not say a word.</p><p>After a long while, white teeth finally calmed down.</p><p>you don’t know anything. Even if I tell you, you won’t be able to explain it clearly. How about this, you will inherit master’s inheritance first!</p><p>After Bai Ya finished speaking, a picture scroll appeared in his hand. When he unrolled the picture scroll, a young man was drawn on it. He was extraordinarily handsome and extremely life-like.</p><p>It was none other than the owner of the White fangs, Jing Yu!</p><p>Moreover, the Dominator’s will that was emitted from this portrait was shockingly rich. It was many times more intense than any statue that Lu Ming had come into contact with.</p><p>“Lu Ming, use your path of domination to resonate with master’s portrait. Then, you will naturally be able to inherit master’s legacy!”</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and immediately activated the path of domination.</p><p>as expected, the moment he used his sovereign Dao, the scroll began to exude a violet-gold light.</p><p>After a moment, the picture scroll turned into a ray of light and flew into Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to see a young man standing in his sea of consciousness with his hands behind his back. His entire body was emitting a dazzling purple-gold light. It was a vast Dominator s will.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>At this moment, the young man shouted, and the word ‘fight’ flew out.</p><p>The word ‘battle’ was filled with an ancient aura, as if it had transcended countless years and come from the long river of time.</p><p>It seemed to represent the source of all the battles in this world. It was mysterious and unfathomable. It was many times more mysterious than the ‘battle’ character that Lu Ming had previously comprehended.</p><p>After a long while, all the strange phenomena in Lu Ming’s mind disappeared. There were only two things left in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>It was a painting!</p><p>It was an ancient ‘battle’ character!</p><p>As for other information, there was nothing at all. There was also no cultivation technique or secret manual. Lu Ming was greatly disappointed.</p><p>“How is it? What did you obtain from master’s inheritance?”</p><p>White teeth asked.</p><p>just two things. A picture scroll and an ancient ‘battle’ character. There s no other information!</p><p>Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>I see. I understand now. Master has sealed everything in the scroll. Your cultivation must be too low, so you can’t get any information!</p><p>White tooth said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
