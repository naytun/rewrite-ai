He was wearing a black robe and had a handsome and elegant. appearance, giving off a gentle feeling.</p><p>“Xi ‘er greets the general!”</p><p>When she saw this young man, Tong Xi ‘er hurriedly stood up and bowed.</p><p>This man was the general of the righteous heaven Army, the ancestor of technique of the heaven realm, the legendary figure who had founded the cultivation system of the nomological laws.</p><p>“Hahaha, no need to be so polite. I’m here to meet my fellow villager!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique laughed and walked in.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets the ancestor of technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming also stood up and bowed. It was his first time meeting this legendary figure and he was very excited. “No need to be so polite, no need to be so polite!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique waved his hand and a gentle force lifted Lu Ming up.</p><p>it’s been many years since someone called me by this t.i.tle. In the future, you can call me general like everyone else!</p><p>The ancestor of technique smiled and sized Lu Ming up carefully,</p><p>he has the aura of the heaven realm. He’s indeed from the heaven realm. He has even cultivated the system of laws and condensed a small world….</p><p>The ancestor of technique murmured. He looked at Lu Ming with an increasingly friendly gaze.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how did you get out of the heaven realm? What happened in the heaven realm? I once sneaked into the dark underworld star, but the pa.s.sage to the heaven realm has been sealed, so I can’t even get in!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique asked a few questions. It was clear that he was not calm either.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that the ancestor of technique must have returned to the shadowed star after his cultivation had improved.</p><p>However, the pa.s.sage was sealed by ancestral Dragon and patriarch of prison suppression with heaven suppression talismans. The ancestor of technique was too strong, and if he broke the seal by force, he would destroy the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Senior, it’s like this…”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming gave a brief account of what had happened in the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm. ‘I see. I see…</p><p>After the ancestor of technique heard this, he nodded and sighed.</p><p>senior, I’ve brought out most of the divine beasts and humans in the heaven realm and the primordial realm. In a few months, our small world will merge with the primeval universe. We need a place to settle these living beings!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s easy. I’ll pick a place for you immediately!</p><p>The ancestor of technique laughed.</p><p>The true heavenstar was astonishingly large, several times larger than the dark underworld star. It was a place for the living beings of the heaven realm and the primordial realm to relax.</p><p>“Follow me!’</p><p>The ancestor of technique was swift and decisive in his work. With a wave of his sleeve, a wave of energy swept Lu Ming up and flew out.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s speed was extremely shocking. The scenery around them kept flying past. Not long after, they had flown far away and arrived at a gra.s.sland.</p><p>This gra.s.sland stretched as far as the eye could see, and there was no end to it at all.</p><p>this gra.s.sland is wide and open, and its area is at least ten times the size of the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm. Your small world can merge here!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very excited.</p><p>Finally, he had found a way out of the heaven realm. He had finally won a chance of survival and successfully escaped with everyone.</p><p>“Senior, please wait a moment!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming had a thought and his figure appeared on a mountain peak in his small world.</p><p>Here, the ancestral Dragon, venerable Lord sky Thunder, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the rest had been waiting for Lu Ming’s news.</p><p>At the same time, they were also prepared to fight to the death if there was any danger.</p><p>La Ming…</p><p>The moment La Ming appeared, zu long and the rest looked at him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s the situation now?”</p><p>“If we really can’t do it, we’ll just fight to the death!”</p><p>Everyone chimed in.</p><p>“Everyone, we have already left the dark underworld star!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What? Have you left the dark underworld star?”</p><p>Zu long and the others were stunned for a moment, and then they were overjoyed.</p><p>He had left the underworld star, could it be that he had already escaped?</p><p>“We’re safe. Also, I’ll take you to see someone!”</p><p>With that, a force enveloped the ancestral Dragon and the others, moving them out of the small world.</p><p>The moment the ancestral Dragon and the others appeared, they looked around. The next moment, they all focused on the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“This is …</p><p>After seeing the ancestor of technique, the ancestral Dragon, Heavenly Thunder Emperor, and the others were stunned.</p><p>“Master… Master…”</p><p>The heavenly Thunder Emperor muttered to himself as if he had been dumbfounded. Then, he trembled with excitement.</p><p>“Disciple greets master!”</p><p>After a long while, the heavenly Thunder Emperor bowed down.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique, it’s the ancestor of technique!”</p><p>At the same time, some people cried out in surprise.</p><p>A portion of these people had existed since the archaic Era. Some of them were even older than the ancestor</p><p>of technique, so they naturally knew him.</p><p>Now that he saw the ancestor of technique, he was shocked.</p><p>The ancestor of technique had left the heaven realm a long time ago. He didn’t expect to meet him here.</p><p>“Tianlei, it’s been many years since we last met. It’s time for you to make a breakthrough in your cultivation!”</p><p>He said.</p><p>The ancestor of technique smiled.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique…</p><p>The ancestral Dragon muttered with a complicated gaze.</p><p>When the ancestor of technique was still in the heaven realm, he had already been ordered to guard the heaven realm. When the ancestor of technique left the heaven realm, he naturally knew.</p><p>Also, he knew that those people would be controlled by the yuanluo Palace once they left the heaven realm, but he had no choice. He couldn’t stop them or remind them.</p><p>It was not until the prison-guarding patriarch went to the beaven realm and took out the heaven-suppressing seal that they joined forces and sealed the pa.s.sage to the heaven realm.</p><p>However, to his surprise, the ancestor of technique was not controlled by the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>it’s like this. The ancestor of technique has created the righteous Army to fight against the yuanluo Palace</p><p>Lu Ming briefly told him about the ancestor of technique and how they came to the true heavenstar. “The general of the righteous Army…</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the others muttered. At this moment, they deeply understood that the ancestor of technique’s current realm was far beyond what they could guess. It was probably shockingly high.</p><p>Otherwise, how could they establish the righteous Army and resist the yuanluo Palace?</p><p>Some of the people here were of the same generation as the ancestor of technique, and some of them were even older than him. But at this moment, all of their eyes were filled with respect.</p><p>The path of cultivation was like this. The one who had reached the top came first, regardless of age.</p><p>Since the ancestor of technique’s cultivation was already far above them, they naturally could not look at him</p><p>like they were of the same generation.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s gaze swept across the crowd and he nodded slightly.</p><p>He felt rather complicated.</p><p>There were many familiar faces here.</p><p>After so many years, he was quite moved to see so many familiar faces.</p><p>alright, you guys can stay here for now, I’ll send someone to help you. If you need anything, you can let me</p><p>know!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said. With that, he turned into a beam of light and left this place.</p><p>“Is this the primal universe? What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>this kind of cultivation environment is truly shocking. I feel like I’m about to break through!</p><p>“Ilaha, me too!”</p><p>The moment the ancestor of technique left, everyone started to feel it. They were all shocked by the cultivation environment here.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
