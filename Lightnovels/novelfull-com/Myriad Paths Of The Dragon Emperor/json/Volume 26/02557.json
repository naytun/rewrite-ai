Then, they tore the void apart and left.</p><p>Escape, escape, escape!</p><p>A few non-human Kings were fleeing in a frenzy.</p><p>However, a figure suddenly appeared in front of them.</p><p>“He’s the one…”</p><p>When the Kings saw this figure, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance here meant that the divine ancestor of the non-human race was in grave danger. “Everyone, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he waved his hand and a spear radiance burst out. A few old Kings of the non-human race wanted to escape, but they could not withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A few old Kings were pierced by Lu Ming’s spear radiance and died on the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop after killing a few of the old Kings. He tore through the void and left.</p><p>He specialized in hunting non-human experts above peak heavenly Emperor because they could tear the void apart and travel through different worlds. It was very difficult to pursue them.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s hands, these people could not escape.</p><p>Lu Ming kept shuttling through the void, killing the alien races ‘powerhouses who were at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm and above. As a result, the experts in the heaven realm were free to join the army of the heaven realm and pursue the alien races.</p><p>One-sided, it had become completely one-sided.</p><p>When the heaven realm’s peak experts and demiG.o.ds entered the battlefield, it became a complete ma.s.sacre.</p><p>A large number of foreign heavenly emperors, great emperors, true emperors, void emperors, and quasi-emperors were slaughtered.</p><p>This ma.s.sacre continued for several days.</p><p>Almost all the great beings of the other races had been slaughtered, and almost none of them had escaped back to the evil G.o.d World.</p><p>A great victory, a true great victory!</p><p>After that, the demiG.o.ds from the heaven realm, peak heavenly emperors, charged straight to the evil G.o.d tribe and razed the evil G.o.d Realm’s ten great imperial cities and holy mountains. They slaughtered all the experts above the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>When facing the evil G.o.d tribe, no one showed mercy. It was because either one side would die, or the other would.</p><p>“We won! We won!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Cheers could be heard everywhere in the heaven realm. Countless people were extremely excited.</p><p>He had finally won!</p><p>For countless years, the evil G.o.d tribe had been a huge rock that had been pressing down on the hearts of countless people in the heaven realm.</p><p>It was like a knife hanging over everyone’s head, ready to cut down at any moment, making it hard for many</p><p>people to breathe.</p><p>But now, the evil G.o.d tribe that had suppressed the heaven realm for countless years had been defeated by them. All of their experts had been killed. From now on, there would no longer be any enemies in the heaven realm. Naturally, they would be very excited.</p><p>Lu Ming did not partic.i.p.ate in the battle that followed. He returned to the lair of Zulong.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon had arrived. IIe put his hands behind his back and looked at the golden seal and the hideous crack with an extremely ugly expression.</p><p>“Senior…</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon said. His voice was a little lonely, as if he had suddenly aged a lot.</p><p>I know you have a lot of questions. I didn’t want to tell you about this, but now I have to!</p><p>I will gather everyone here and tell you everything in detail!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, zu long took out a big drum and hit it.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The war drum shook, and the sound of the boom spread out at a terrifying speed. The entire tai Qing heavenly region could hear it.</p><p>It could even spread to other heavenly regions.</p><p>In the heaven realm, countless people were celebrating. However, when they heard this war drum, everyone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“What’s going on? This is a war drum, and it’s ourgent that it’s only sounded when there’s an extreme crisis!”</p><p>“Who sounded the war drum?”</p><p>this is the ancestral Dragon War drum. Only senior ancestral Dragon can sound it!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, the heavenly realm was in a mess.</p><p>Didn’t they win? why did the ancestral Dragon sound this kind of war drum? could it be that there was another danger in the heaven realm?</p><p>The excitement from before had disappeared, and everyone’s heart was covered with a shadow.</p><p>Countless people flew toward the lair of Zulong.</p><p>Furthermore, the news spread rapidly. The experts who were struggling in the evil G.o.d Realm had also heard the news and rushed to the lair of Zulong.</p><p>Not long after, Xic nianqing and Xie nianjun appeared in the void near the lair of Zulong.</p><p>They looked at the golden scal and their eyes flashed as if they understood something.</p><p>After that, more and more people came.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord war G.o.d!”</p><p>The crowd came forward and paid their respects to Lu Ming and the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming had fully displayed the combat strength of a martial G.o.d previously. Naturally, they treated Lu Ming</p><p>as a martial G.o.d and were very respectful.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ancestral Dragon nodded and did not say much,</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more creatures gathered around the lair of Zulong.</p><p>After a few days, this place was densely packed with countless heaven realm powerhouses.</p><p>The strongest group of people in the heaven realm had almost all arrived.</p><p>“Most of the people are here!”</p><p>Zu long looked around and said,” today, I want to tell you some things. Originally, I didn’t want to say these</p><p>things!</p><p>At the scene, no one spoke, waiting for the ancestral Dragon to continue.</p><p>the foreign race’s divine ancestor, the divine ancestor bloodheart, has already died….</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“He’s really dead…</p><p>In the heaven realm, most of the people were ecstatic. They had only been guessing before, but now that the ancestral Dragon had confirmed they finally relaxed.</p><p>However, some of them didn’t look happy because they could see that the ancestral Dragon didn’t look happy</p><p>at all. Instead, he looked solemn.</p><p>Zu long waved his hand, and the scene quieted down.</p><p>let me tell you, although we have defeated the foreign kinds, a greater crisis is coming!</p><p>Zu long continued.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The moment the ancestral Dragon said that, most of them were shocked and then looked puzzled.</p><p>A bigger crisis?</p><p>If the alien races were defeated, how could there be a greater danger?</p><p>“Don’t tell me…”</p><p>Many people looked at the golden seal and the crack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura came from the crack again. It was indescribably terrifying. Everyone’s face</p><p>changed and they wanted to kneel down.</p><p>After that, two b.a.l.l.s of light appeared and flickered non-stop. After a while, they left.</p><p>Gulp, gulp…</p><p>Many people kept swallowing their saliva, and their faces were very serious.</p><p>They guessed that the danger the ancestral Dragon was talking about might come from there.</p><p>However, what was behind the golden seal? Why was there such a terrifying aura? it was many times stronger than the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>In this world, was there still an existence stronger than the martial G.o.d?</p><p>Many people were puzzled.</p><p>do you know why the evil G.o.d tribe attacked our heaven realm? do you know why they want to destroy our</p><p>heaven realm?”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon continued.</p><p>The eyes</p><p>f many people flickered, including Lu Ming,</p><p>This question had been on Lu Ming’s mind all along.</p><p>Why did the evil G.o.d race have to attack the heaven realm and destroy it? It was not good for both sides to</p><p>live in peace.</p><p>Even if they were fighting for resources, they shouldn’t be lighting like this.</p><p>in</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
