During this period of time, the Dragon sovereign peak was lacking powerhouses.</p><p>Sometimes, there were still some five-star and six-star heavenly emperors who stayed at the Dragon Emperor Peak. However, these experts had all left during this period of time.</p><p>It was obvious that the three Lords of Darkness had taken advantage of this gap to come here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the treasures you have and we three brothers will spare your life!”</p><p>The Black Bat King clamored again.</p><p>So what if there were many experts behind Lu Ming?</p><p>As long as they snatched Lu Ming’s treasures and found a place to hide, who would be able to find them?</p><p>“It seems that I need to show my might!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Obviously, most people were afraid of the power behind him and didn’t dare to attack him, but that didn’t mean that everyone didn’t dare to.</p><p>Those Desperados who had nothing to worry about dared!</p><p>All of this was because many people thought that Lu Ming was not strong enough.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming was going to put an end to these people’s thoughts.</p><p>Initially, the formation that he had set up here was enough to kill the three Lords of Darkness. However, Lu Ming did not plan to activate the formation this time. He wanted to take action personally.</p><p>“Father, mother, I need to go out for a while!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you have to be careful!”</p><p>Li Ping said with concern.</p><p>“Father, mother, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a step forward. In the next moment, he appeared in the sky above the Dragon sovereign peak, facing the three Lords of Darkness.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s too dangerous for him to face the three Lords of Darkness like this!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re finally willing to come out!”</p><p>The Blackwing King of the Three Kings of darkness sneered.</p><p>I’ll take into account that it wasn’t easy for you to cultivate. Surrender and become my mountain Guardian divine beast, and I’ll spare your lives!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness were stunned, and they looked at each other.</p><p>Lu Ming actually asked them to surrender and even asked them to be his Guardian divine beasts. Was he crazy?</p><p>Did he think that there were still powerhouses keeping watch at the Dragon sovereign peak?</p><p>They had been hiding at the Dragon Emperor Peak for too years. They knew the entrance and exit of the Dragon Emperor Peak like the back of their hands.</p><p>He wanted to scare them!</p><p>They thought that Lu Ming was bluffing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to Bluff. We know the Dragon sovereign peak like the back of our hands. You can’t scare us!”</p><p>The Black Bat King laughed coldly.</p><p>that’s right. Today, the strongest person in your Dragon sovereign peak is only a four-star heavenly Emperor!</p><p>The black wing King sneered.</p><p>The Black Eagle King, the leader of the Three Kings of darkness, had not said a word.</p><p>“Oh, really? The strongest expert at the Dragon sovereign peak was only a four-star heavenly Emperor? How did you guys come to this conclusion?”</p><p>The smile at the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth grew wider. Then, he continued to take steps forward.</p><p>you’re bluffing. Since that’s the case, I’ll kill you and your treasures will still belong to us!</p><p>The Black Bat King let out a long screech, and in a flash, he disappeared.</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness were known for their speed, and the Black Bat King’s movement was extremely fast.</p><p>Most people on the same level as him could not keep up with his speed at all.</p><p>However, he had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there, unmoving, as if he had not seen the Black Bat King attack.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Thunder one, gold one, and the rest of the people from Dragon sovereign peak were all shocked.</p><p>“Let’s go and help the young master!”</p><p>Thunder one, gold one, and the rest were about to rush toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t interfere…”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and stopped Lei Yi and the rest from taking action.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a bright ray of light shot out from behind Lu Ming, aiming for the middle of his back.</p><p>The Black Bat monarch had launched his attack. His timing was impeccable. When Lu Ming stopped Lei Yi and the rest, he revealed a flaw.</p><p>In addition, the Black Bat King’s attack was fast, accurate, and ruthless. He was completely confident that this move would hit Lu Ming.</p><p>As expected, he had stabbed her!</p><p>The long sword in his palm pierced Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed drastically because they thought that Lu Ming was done for. He was going to fall at the hands of the Blackbat monarch.</p><p>The reason for the Black Bat King’s change in expression was the exact opposite of the others.</p><p>That was because he realized that his long sword had pierced Lu Ming’s back but could not penetrate it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be tougher than any divine weapon. His long sword stopped on Lu Ming’s skin and could no longer penetrate it no matter how much power he exerted.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Black Bat monarch roared in his heart and wanted to retreat. However, he was shocked to find that Lu Ming’s body had produced a terrifying force that was firmly sucking him in. He could not retreat at all.</p><p>He couldn’t even move even if he wanted to, let alone retreat!</p><p>Terrifying, extremely terrifying!</p><p>At this moment, the Black Bat King’s heart was filled with fear. He suddenly understood that he was facing an extremely terrifying existence.</p><p>The Black Bat King’s face turned even uglier than if he were crying.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around slowly and faced the Blackbat King with a bright smile.</p><p>“Your strength isn’t that great, is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone else in the area was also dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why was it that Lu Ming was completely fine when the Blackbat monarch had stabbed him? on the other hand, the Blackbat monarch was just standing there motionless, as if he had been frozen in place.</p><p>Many people were already dumbfounded!</p><p>big brother, second brother, let’s go! This man is evil!</p><p>The Black Bat King reacted and immediately shouted.</p><p>“Let go of my third brother!”</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>The Black Eagle King and the black wing King didn’t leave. With a roar, they revealed their true forms.</p><p>It was a giant black Eagle and a giant black Sparrow.</p><p>The Black Eagle King and the black wing King flapped their wings, stirring up a strong wind as they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stubborn! Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stretched out a hand and pressed down on the void.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, endless energy gathered, and a huge purple-gold hand formed. It covered a part of the sky, and pressed down on the Black Eagle King and the black wing King.</p><p>The terrifying power caused the Black Eagle King and the black wing King’s expressions to change.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>The Black Eagle King roared in fear, flapped his wings, and turned to leave.</p><p>That was because he knew that he was no match for Lu Ming the moment he struck out with his palm.</p><p>The black wing King did the same and turned to leave.</p><p>However, they could not leave at all.</p><p>The two of them were like two very slow mosquitos that were enveloped by a palm. They could not escape the range of the Palm’s suppression at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The purple-gold Palm pressed down. The Black Eagle King and the black wing King screamed in pain as they were pressed to the ground by Lu Ming’s palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
