Back then, we killed the immortal venerable sovereign!”</p><p>“Obliterate him!”</p><p>Cold voices rang out one after another. The seven demigods of the non-human race did not stop attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could only focus on defense.</p><p>However, the seven demigods working together were too terrifying. No one in the world could stop them except for the martial God.</p><p>If it had been any other demigod, they would have been instantly blown up by the joint attack of seven experts of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming had only blocked a few of their attacks and was hit again.</p><p>This time, his injuries were even more serious. More than half of his body had exploded, and his internal organs could be clearly seen. Some of his internal organs had even turned into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned pale and he vomited a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“He’s going to die. Attack and completely destroy him!”</p><p>A few non-human Kings became excited.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too shocking. They were a little frightened. It was a great thing to be able to kill Lu Ming now.</p><p>“You want to kill me?you can’t do it!”</p><p>A fruit appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p>It was the life fruit!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After swallowing the life fruit, the life fruit seemed to explode and turned into endless life energy that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries recovered rapidly. His body, which had exploded, grew back completely in an instant.</p><p>It was simply a miracle. This was the effect of the life fruit.</p><p>the fruit of life, it’s the fruit of life from netherworld mountain. The ancestral Dragon is actually willing to give him a fruit of life!</p><p>A non-human King exclaimed in envy.</p><p>They had thought that the fruit of life was given to Lu Ming by the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>After all, the non-human divine ancestor and the others had obtained a total of 11 fruits of life when they entered netherworld mountain, but none of them had been given out. They had all been consumed and refined by the non-human divine ancestor and the sacred ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>Therefore, when they saw the life fruit, they were naturally envious.</p><p>“Kill him and extract his blood. There’s still medicinal effects!”</p><p>One of the non-human Kings said coldly as he charged at Lu Ming. He wanted to kill Lu Ming and extract his blood.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>The other non-human demigods also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on, come on!”</p><p>There was a crazed look in Lu Ming’s eyes. His injuries had almost recovered after consuming the life fruit. He had raised his abilities to the maximum.</p><p>In this life-and-death crisis, he seemed to see the bottleneck of the battle character formula, as if he could break through this bottleneck at any time.</p><p>The great desolation spear bloomed in Lu Ming’s hands and shot out beams of dazzling spear radiance at the seven non-human demigods.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two sides continued to collide. Lu Ming was still no match for them and he was severely injured in the collision.</p><p>However, the life fruit was indeed mysterious and its medicinal effects were shocking. Lu Ming’s blood was filled with strong vitality. Once Lu Ming was injured, he would recover quickly.</p><p>As long as he was not killed in an instant, Lu Ming could recover very quickly.</p><p>For this reason, he managed to withstand the opponent’s attack.</p><p>“Soon,soon!”</p><p>In such a desperate situation, Lu Ming’s mind was highly focused. He used the battle character formula to the extreme.</p><p>the life fruit’s medicinal effects are too strong. It’s hard to kill him like this!</p><p>A non-human King roared.</p><p>“Then I’ll completely refine him!”</p><p>The non-human King, who was covered in flames, spoke coldly. Then, his third eye shone brightly and a furnace appeared from it.</p><p>Then, the non-human King’s body shrank rapidly and disappeared into the furnace. The furnace burst out with a terrifying devouring power, wanting to devour Lu Ming.</p><p>The other six kings of the foreign races worked together and attacked Lu Ming continuously, trying to throw him into the furnace.</p><p>Lu Ming resisted with all his might, but his body was still moving towards the furnace. Before he even entered, the terrifying temperature was already making his skin hurt.</p><p>This was a terrifying attack method that Lu Ming had seen before.</p><p>Back then, at the foot of the evil god tribe’s holy mountain, Lu Ming had challenged the longevity Roll and fought Kang duo, who was ranked second on the longevity Roll. In the end, Kang duo had also used this move, and its power was indeed shocking.</p><p>This non-human King’s attack was much more powerful than Kang duo’s.</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in his heart. The great desolation spear vibrated continuously. It vibrated hundreds of millions of times per second.</p><p>This was also because the great desolation spear was a heaven Dao weapon and its material was amazing. If it was a normal great emperor weapon, it would have exploded into pieces after shaking so many times every second.</p><p>Suddenly, the great desolation spear trembled and the spear light exploded. A spear light pierced through the air and forced the two non-human Kings back.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed!</p><p>He had broken through. The battle symbol art had broken through the bottleneck and reached a whole new realm.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the battle formula crazily.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt an explosion in his body. An endless fighting spirit burst out from the depths of his body. Then, this fighting spirit turned into rolling power, causing Lu Ming’s strength to soar in an instant.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his spear and exchanged a blow with a King of the alien race. The king’s body shook violently and he was sent flying tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>“Damn it, his battle prowess … Why did it suddenly skyrocket…”</p><p>The non-human Kings were all shocked.</p><p>“My battle strength…”</p><p>Even Lu Ming himself was shocked.</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ming realized that his combat strength had doubled.</p><p>That’s right, his overall combat strength had doubled, and it was all because he had activated the battle character.</p><p>“Fight, fight, fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was boundless. He kept waving the great desolation spear, sending out rays of spear radiance that were a million miles long, sweeping across the void.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The smelting furnace that the non-human King had transformed into was sent flying by Lu Ming’s whip. It crashed into the ground and exploded. Everything within a radius of a million miles was reduced to ashes. Not a single blade of grass could grow.</p><p>let’s work together. Don’t split up. Let’s attack together!</p><p>One of the Kings roared.</p><p>The non-human Kings didn’t dare to split up. They all worked together, and every time they attacked, they attacked together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked a few moves and his figure only retreated slightly.</p><p>This was already an extremely terrifying thing.</p><p>previously, he had been at a disadvantage even when facing two demigods, and it had been rather difficult.</p><p>But now, he was facing the joint attack of so many demigods, and he only retreated slightly.</p><p>One could see how much his combat strength had improved.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>The non-human Kings were all shocked and couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p><p>What kind of monster was Lu Ming? he could actually increase his combat strength in a big battle.</p><p>Most importantly, they did not discover that Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through. His cultivation had not broken through but his combat strength had increased tremendously. What was going on?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a boom, the non-human King that had turned into a furnace returned to his original form and rushed out of the ground. He met up with the six demigods, and his eyes were extremely serious.</p><p>“Haha, I won’t play with you guys today. Let’s fight another day!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. He took a step forward and the space cracked. He wanted to tear the space apart and escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
