What level of divine artifact fragment do you need? Different levels of fragments of divine artifacts have different prices!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>a fragment of a low-grade divine artifact. Any grade will do!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, under the young lady’s introduction, Lu Ming bought a large number of divine artifact fragments.</p><p>As expected of Cloud Peak City, there were many divine artifact fragments here. It could be said that they were piled up like a mountain.</p><p>Moreover, the price was indeed cheap. Not to mention divine artifacts, even compared to the materials used for forging artifacts, it was much cheaper.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and spent another ten thousand divine crystals to buy a large pile of refining materials of various levels. It was enough for QiuQiu to eat for a period of time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s divine crystals had shrunk again. He only had eighteen thousand pieces left.</p><p>“I need to find a way to earn some divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Eighteen thousand divine crystals weren’t enough for him. As his cultivation increased, he would need more divine crystals to break through in the future.</p><p>The two of them had bought everything they needed. They walked out of the shop and planned to take the teleportation array back.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er, and you, kid …</p><p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing voice filled with resentment rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and could not help but sneer.</p><p>What a coincidence, he met an old acquaintance.</p><p>Behind them were two young men. One of them was the young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long.</p><p>Kang long was glaring at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>Back then, he was captured by Lu Ming and later handed over to the righteous sky Army as a hostage in exchange.</p><p>He regarded this matter as a great humiliation. He hated Lu Ming to the core and always wanted to take revenge on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was hiding in the righteous Army and he had no choice. He did not expect to meet him in Yunfeng city.</p><p>“Kang long, situ Xiao!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s eyes flashed as she recognized the two of them.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll tear you into pieces sooner or later!”</p><p>Kang Long’s eyes were cold and filled with killing intent. He glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that they were in Yunfeng city and killing was forbidden, he would have crushed Lu Ming’s bones and scattered his ashes long ago.</p><p>a defeated opponent dares to talk big here. Who doesn’t know how to brag? ” Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at Kang long, his eyes filled with contempt.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>At the thought of being captured and imprisoned by Lu Ming for months, Kang long was furious. He gritted his teeth and looked at Lu Ming’s disdainful expression. He wanted to slap Lu Ming to death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Kang Long’s body and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>1st level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>It was obvious that Kang long had made a breakthrough from demiG.o.d-level to virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>The commotion here attracted the attention of the pa.s.sers-by, who looked over as if they were watching a show.</p><p>“If you want to fight, come!”</p><p>Lu Ming curled his finger.</p><p>He did not believe that Kang long would dare to make a move in Yunfeng city. If he did, he would be courting death.</p><p>kid, I challenge you now. Let’s fight on the fighting ring!</p><p>Kang long glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You? I’m not interested in a defeated opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. Kang long was so angry that he almost exploded.</p><p>Taking a few deep breaths, Kang long managed to calm himself down and said, ” “You’re the one who doesn’t dare!”</p><p>Back then, he felt that he had been too careless when he lost to Lu Ming. Moreover, he had now broken through to first-tier void G.o.d-level and his combat strength had increased tremendously. He was fully confident that he could easily suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“You don’t have to provoke me. I’m really not interested in my defeated opponent. If there’s nothing else, don’t block the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually.</p><p>He was speaking the truth. Kang long was only at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. He could easily suppress him. He was not interested.</p><p>However, Lu Ming kept calling him a defeated opponent. To Kang long, it was the greatest insult to him.</p><p>His face was red, and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>“If you don’t want to fight with brother Kang, then I’ll challenge you. Do you dare to fight?”</p><p>The young man beside Kang long spoke.</p><p>The man’s face was fair and clean, and he was waving a folding fan in his hand. He always had a confident smile on his face.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this man is the young sect master of the Walkabout sect, situ Xiao. He’s at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>The Walkabout sect was a force that was as powerful as the yuan Luo Palace and the righteous Army.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at situ Xiao.</p><p>“That’s right, do you dare? If you don’t dare, I won’t make things difficult for you!”</p><p>Situ Xiao said with a fake smile.</p><p>to be honest, I’m not interested in you at all. With your cultivation, I can easily suppress you!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Situ Xiao’s eyelids kept twitching, and the folding fan that he had been Fanning also stopped. A wisp of cold killing intent burst out from his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that he could suppress him with a flip of his hand?</p><p>It was simply a huge joke. He could clearly feel that Lu Ming was only at the transformation void martial stage. A transformation void martial stage actually dared to speak so arrogantly. He was simply courting death.</p><p>“However, if you dare to make a bet with me, I can fight you!”</p><p>Lu Ming paused for a moment before he continued.</p><p>“Bet? How do we bet?”</p><p>Situ Xiao said.</p><p>“We’ll bet twenty thousand divine crystals. We’ll each take out twenty thousand divine crystals. Whoever wins will take the other’s twenty thousand divine crystals. How about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>twenty thousand divine crystals!</p><p>Situ Xiao’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Twenty thousand Yuan was not a small amount.</p><p>“What, you don’t dare to bet? Then forget it!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a look of contempt on his face. He turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>“I’ll bet 20000 Yuan!”</p><p>Situ Xiao said.</p><p>He didn’t think he would lose, so he agreed.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s go to the battle stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming, Tong Xi ‘er, Kang long, and situ Xiao went to the nearby fighting ring.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“That young man is only at the transformation void martial stage, but he dares to challenge a second level ethereal G.o.d Realm heaven’s favorite. Interesting!”</p><p>The people nearby followed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a nearby fighting ring.</p><p>The fighting ring was surrounded by people.</p><p>“Take out twenty thousand divine crystals. I need a middleman to make sure you don’t go back on your word!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at situ Xiao.</p><p>“How can I lose? What a joke!”</p><p>Situ Xiao sneered.</p><p>that’s hard to say. How do you know if you haven’t fought? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and looked around. “Which senior can be the middleman?”</p><p>“This old man will do it!”</p><p>A silver-haired old man walked out, and he gave off a powerful aura.</p><p>“Ninth level void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>On the side, many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, those at the true G.o.d Realm were definitely experts. Those at the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm were the backbone of many forces.</p><p>“Alright, thank you, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming pa.s.sed a storage ring to the silver-haired elder.</p><p>There were twenty thousand divine crystals in it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s original divine crystals were not enough for twenty thousand pieces. On the way, he borrowed two thousand more from Tong Xi ‘er.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
