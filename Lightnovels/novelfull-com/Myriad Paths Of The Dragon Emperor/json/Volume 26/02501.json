The Titan longhorn beetle also kept its mouth shut. This was a martial God. Only the ancestral Dragon, who was also a martial God, had the right to speak to such a person.</p><p>Otherwise, if it wasn’t for the ancestral Dragon, he probably wouldn’t even want to see them.</p><p>that’s right. We’ll work together. You can help us enter the netherworld Island and we’ll split the treasures we get on the island 50 – 50. It’s beneficial to everyone. How about it? ”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Yellow Springs Island?”</p><p>The white-haired old man was stunned for a moment. Then, he sighed and said, it seems that you all came from beyond the heavens. Time passes so quickly. The tribulations have passed so quickly!</p><p>The white-haired old man’s voice was filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>The white-haired old man seemed to think of something, and after a long while, he said, you can go now. My yellow spring sect has no interest in yellow spring Island!</p><p>“Not interested?”</p><p>Zu Long’s eyes narrowed. Lu Ming and the rest were shocked. Was he going to fail?</p><p>fellow Daoist, how about this? as long as you do us a favor, all the treasures we get on the yellow Springs Island will belong to you. How about it? ”</p><p>Zu long was unwilling to give up and continued.</p><p>I said, I’m not interested. See the guest out!</p><p>The white-haired old man waved his sleeve and turned to leave.</p><p>“Everyone, please!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from before waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group looked a little pale.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the people of the yellow spring sect didn’t care about the treasures on the island at all.</p><p>If they couldn’t get help from the netherworld sect, how could they fight against the netherworld Empire and the divine ancestor?</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the others were anxious, but they couldn’t think of anything.</p><p>“Hey, let’s go!”</p><p>Zu long was also helpless. He turned around and walked down the mountain.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>if you don’t want to help, then don’t help. At most, we’ll go and save them ourselves. It’s just death!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle cursed, feeling extremely unhappy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stopped and continued to study the stone tablet in front of the yellow spring sect.</p><p>The more he looked at it, the more he felt that the stone tablet looked familiar.</p><p>“That’s right, that token …”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming thought of the token. With a thought, a token appeared in his hand.</p><p>This token was the one that he and dandan had obtained in the core area of the void God Island.</p><p>The appearance of this token was very similar to the stone tablet in front of the yellow spring sect’s Mountain Gate.</p><p>Previously, the stone tablet was covered in moss. Lu Ming felt that it looked familiar. Now that he took a closer look, Lu Ming finally remembered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming took out the token, the stone tablet in front of the mountain Gate of the yellow spring sect suddenly trembled. The ‘yellow’ character suddenly emitted a dazzling radiance.</p><p>At the same time, the token in Lu Ming’s hand also vibrated, and light flowed out continuously.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming was shocked to discover that a word had suddenly appeared in the middle of the token. It was a ‘yellow’ word.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Ever since he had obtained this token, he had studied it a lot but he had not found anything. There were no words in the middle of the token either.</p><p>But now, a ‘yellow’ character had suddenly appeared. This way, the token and the stone tablet looked exactly the same.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, the nine lives devilish silkworm, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the others were also extremely shocked, not understanding what was going on.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed. The white-haired old man reappeared.</p><p>He looked at the token in Lu Ming’s hand in shock. Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “The underworld token. How did you get it? how did you get it?” “Yellow Springs token?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It turned out that this token was called the underworld token.</p><p>“Senior, this token was obtained by this junior from a void God Island …”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Void God Island?”</p><p>“Tell me, who gave you the token? what does he look like?” the white-haired old man asked, puzzled.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately described the appearance of the statue on the void God Island.</p><p>“So it’s him, so it’s him, it’s heaven’s will!”</p><p>The white-haired elder sighed and looked at Lu Ming, back then, that person did us a favor. We gave him this token and promised that if someone came to our sect with this token, we would help them unconditionally!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming, zu long, and the others were overjoyed when they heard this.</p><p>Help him unconditionally once? Then, he could ask for help from the netherworld sect.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked.</p><p>“Junior is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, Lu Ming. If you have any requests, feel free to let me know!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Senior, it’s like this …”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming briefly explained the grudges between the heaven realm and the evil god tribe, then he talked about the situation here.</p><p>I ask for the help of the seniors of the yellow spring sect to fight against the yellow spring Empire and enter the yellow spring Island!</p><p>Lu Ming made his request.</p><p>I’m afraid it’s very difficult for us to enter the netherworld Island alone!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Alt? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>you don’t know yet, right? the entrance to the netherworld Island is guarded by a group of puppets. There are four puppets in this group, which are equivalent to the martial God Realm. Therefore, we can’t get in with our strength alone!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Four war god Realm puppets?”</p><p>Lu Ming, the ancestral Dragon, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the rest looked at each other.</p><p>This Yellow Springs Island was too terrifying. There were four martial God Realm puppets at the entrance. They were martial gods!</p><p>One had to know that there were only two martial gods in the evil god Realm and heaven realm, and they were both injured.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why the divine ancestor of the non-human race had not entered netherworld Island. It was because he could not.</p><p>therefore, if we want to enter the yellow Springs Island, we must cooperate with the yellow Springs Empire!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“Cooperation?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were in deep thought.</p><p>“Senior, please help us save our people!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s fine. I’ll gather some people and then set off!</p><p>The white-haired elder said. Then, he turned around and disappeared into the yellow spring sect.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Qing Cang and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>He did not expect that he would be able to get help from the netherworld sect with Lu Ming’s token.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly. Life was really wonderful and unpredictable.</p><p>He had not expected that the token he had obtained on the void God Island would be of such great use in the yellow Springs world.</p><p>This token would probably be able to change the entire situation.</p><p>Not long after, a large number of experts flew out from the mountain peak of the yellow spring sect.</p><p>Next to the white-haired old man, there was another white-haired old woman, who was also at the martial God Realm.</p><p>The group flew towards the capital of the netherworld Kingdom.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
