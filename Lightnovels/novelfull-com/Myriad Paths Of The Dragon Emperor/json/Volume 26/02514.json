No one was allowed to approach the fruit of life.</p><p>The people below the martial God also seized the opportunity and rushed toward the fruit tree of Life.</p><p>Both sides had more than too people each. How could 18 life fruits be enough to split? naturally, an intense battle began.</p><p>There were more than a hundred chaotic battles, and the strength of both sides was similar. The battle was difficult to determine, and soon, someone fell.</p><p>The heavenly Thunder Emperor was fighting a demigod from the evil god tribe. Qing Cang, the Titan bull, and the others all had their own opponents.</p><p>The area around the fruit of life was boiling, and the energy was chaotic.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor had fought for hundreds of rounds in the sky.</p><p>Both sides wanted to obtain the life fruit, but they didn’t want the other to obtain it. Naturally, they had to go all out.</p><p>don’t linger in the battle! Snatch the fruit!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor sent a message to his subordinates.</p><p>All of the evil god tribe members attacked the heaven realm beings with all their might. They then seized the opportunity to rush toward the life fruit.</p><p>“Not good, snatch the life fruit!”</p><p>The heaven realm’s living beings also roared as they all pounced towards the life fruit.</p><p>For a time, each of the 18 fruits of life was targeted by 10 people.</p><p>Everyone surrounded the life fruit and started another round of chaotic battle.</p><p>However, there were still fruits of life that were taken away.</p><p>The first fruit of life had been taken by the demigod of the evil god tribe, but soon after, the heavenly Thunder Emperor had also obtained one.</p><p>Both sides exchanged blows, and in the blink of an eye, a few fruits of life were taken away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, an ordinary-looking member of the evil god race emitted a shocking blood-red light. Then, a drop of blood flew out and turned into a human figure. Its appearance could not be seen clearly, and the blood on its body squirmed as it emitted a shocking killing intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood-red figure rushed out, and a blood-red light was like a sword, killing a few heaven realm creatures. Those few heaven Emperor creatures were directly killed.</p><p>“Saint ancestor bloodheart!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared.</p><p>haha, although my killing heart is far from recovered, I still have the power of a demigod. Let’s see how you can block it.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared.</p><p>The sacred ancestor bloodheart had the power of a demigod and was almost immortal. He was too powerful. In the heaven realm, no one was his match except for the heavenly Thunder Emperor. Wherever he went, all the creatures in the heaven realm were either killed or injured.</p><p>Sacred ancestor bloodheart took several life fruits in a row.</p><p>Very quickly, all 18 life fruits were picked.</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart set his eyes on the heaven realm beings who had picked the fruits of life and charged at them.</p><p>“Dammit! Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>” die! the ancestral Dragon roared and turned into a true dragon. His body was covered in flames and his aura was rising.</p><p>ancestral Dragon, you’re crazy! Do you want to die? ”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared in shock.</p><p>“At most, we’ll die together!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared and charged at the non-human sacred ancestor.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor was knocked back and his body trembled.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon was going all out. He burned his life force to kill sacred ancestor bloodheart and the non-human sacred ancestor.</p><p>Now, the other race had obtained even more fruits of life. If they were to recover, the consequences would be severe. It would be better to die together with them.</p><p>“You’re crazy!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared and didn’t dare to fight. He dashed toward sacred ancestor bloodheart, who turned into a beam of blood light and disappeared into the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor shouted and rushed toward the depths of yellow spring Island.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared and glared at the non-human divine ancestor as he pounced.</p><p>The two of them fought fiercely, clashing continuously. The non-human divine ancestor was injured, but he didn’t want to fight at all. He just wanted to run.</p><p>Now that the alien races had gotten more fruits of life, he didn’t need to risk his life to fight against the ancestral Dragon. As long as he could recover in the future, they would be the ones to succeed.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human Saint ancestor went deep into the netherworld Island, while the other non-human beings also rushed to the mountains and palaces.</p><p>The yellow spring Island was vast, with countless mountains and palaces. Although the heaven realm beings pursued with all their might, their strength was no match for the other party, and they soon lost track of the foreign tribe.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon chased for a while, but he couldn’t catch up with the non- human divine ancestor. The other party escaped and disappeared into the mountains.</p><p>Zu Long’s expression was extremely ugly. He retreated and began to gather the heaven realm beings.</p><p>He had just burned his life force origin, so he appeared to be a little weak and dispirited.</p><p>Soon, the creatures of the heavenly realm gathered here.</p><p>senior ancestral Dragon, you’ve burned your life source. Quickly swallow a life fruit to stabilize your injuries!</p><p>A heaven realm being walked out and handed over a life fruit.</p><p>Although the fruit of life was extremely precious and he was reluctant to part with it, he understood that the ancestral Dragon was the key to the heaven realm. Without the ancestral Dragon, it would be useless no matter how many fruits of life he obtained.</p><p>alright, I’ll remember this life fruit. I’ll give you the appropriate compensation!</p><p>ancestral Dragon nodded and didn’t stand on ceremony. He took the life fruit and swallowed it to refine it.</p><p>A few days later, the ancestral Dragon’s aura stabilized.</p><p>“As expected of the life fruit!”</p><p>Zu long sighed.</p><p>The effect of the fruit of life was truly shocking. The energy of the fruit of life was still far from being refined, but he had stabilized it because of the consumption from burning his life source.</p><p>In the future, as long as he continued to refine the life fruit, the injuries he had suffered in the past would slowly recover.</p><p>“How many life fruits did we get this time?”</p><p>Zu long asked.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon, I’ll take one!”</p><p>“I also have one!”</p><p>Immediately, those heaven realm beings who had obtained the life fruit walked out one after another.</p><p>There were a total of six, and with the one that the ancestral Dragon had swallowed, there were seven in total.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the beings of the heaven realm all had ugly expressions.</p><p>In that case, the evil god tribe had obtained a total of 11.</p><p>eleven pills are enough for Moke and murderer Xin to recover!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon muttered with a gloomy face.</p><p>Although sacred ancestor bloodheart’s injuries were severe and only a wisp of her bloodline was left, she would definitely recover with so many life fruits. This would be a great disaster for the heaven realm.</p><p>senior ancestral Dragon, I’m willing to give this life fruit to you!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Those who got the fruits of life all gave them to the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>They still knew the severity of the situation.</p><p>alright, I’ll take them all. I’ll heal my injuries first. If there’s any more, I’ll give it to the other injured experts to help them recover. Also, if you need anything, just tell me!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>At this time, he did not hold back.</p><p>Moreover, the battle in the ancient past had been extremely tragic. Not only was the ancestral Dragon injured, but there were also other experts.</p><p>For example, the peak heavenly Emperor, the Titan bull, and the nine lives devilish silkworm. However, their injuries had already recovered.</p><p>In the heaven realm, just like them, there were many who had been injured in the ancient times. There were even demigods.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
