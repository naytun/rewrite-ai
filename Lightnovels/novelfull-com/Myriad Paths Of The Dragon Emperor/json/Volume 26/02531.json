BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent boom came from a dark void. Then, the space exploded and two figures rushed out. They exchanged a few moves and then retreated. Another two invincible figures.</p><p>One of them was also a non-human King, and the other was a brawny figure in armor.</p><p>it’s heavenly tiger emperor!</p><p>Someone recognized the burly figure in battle armor.</p><p>Heavenly Tiger Imperial master, the king of the heavenly Tiger race, was also the strongest existence in the heavenly Tiger race. He had a cultivation of the demigod realm.</p><p>The heavenly Thunder Emperor and the non-human King exchanged more than ten moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner. They both retreated.</p><p>In the heaven realm, Lu Ming, Heavenly Thunder Emperor, and heavenly tiger emperor were in a stalemate with the four kings of the alien race.</p><p>In the sky, a terrifying pressure spread.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The non-human king who had fought with Lu Ming earlier growled unwillingly.</p><p>They knew that the invincible Masters of the heaven realm had begun to act.</p><p>Even if they could call for more non-human Kings, the invincible powerhouses from the heaven realm would arrive. This time, they could not kill Lu Ming. The non-human Kings didn’t move, and neither did Supreme Emperor sky Thunder and the others.</p><p>Both sides were wary of each other, and they did not have absolute confidence in defeating the other.</p><p>Carve the formation and defend this place. Let’s see who can rush over!”</p><p>In the end, the four non-human Kings retreated back into the non-human army. They personally took charge of this place and ordered the others to strengthen the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not give chase.</p><p>“Retreat a million li, build an army camp, and surround this place!” Heavenly Thunder Emperor also ordered the Army of the heaven realm. “Yes!”</p><p>The Army of the heavenly realm received the order and retreated a million miles. They began to build barracks and surround this place.</p><p>The two sides were in a confrontation again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return. He retreated to a mountain peak not far away from the heaven realm Army and sat cross-legged, beginning to comprehend and digest what he had gained from the battle just now.</p><p>The news of this battle spread like wildfire in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>At this moment, the Tai Qing heavenly region was in an uproar, as if it had experienced a magnitude 12 earthquake!</p><p>Lu Ming had destroyed the alien camp outside two world city and killed three peak heavenly emperors of the alien race!</p><p>Lu Ming killed his way through. He killed his way into the Hunyuan heavenly realm, the ten thousand spirit heavenly realm, and the abysmal heavenly realm. He broke through three heavenly realms in a row!</p><p>Lu Ming was at the passageway between the netherworld realm and the Beast God Realm. He fought with a King of the alien race and injured him.</p><p>Lu Ming was not defeated by the two kings of the alien race!</p><p>The news set off a storm in the Tai Qing heavenly region and shocked countless people.</p><p>When many people heard this news, their first reaction was disbelief!</p><p>However, when they sent people to two world city to investigate and confirm the news, they were stunned.</p><p>All of this was real!</p><p>Now, countless people from the Tai Qing heavenly region had entered the Hunyuan heavenly region, the ten thousand spirit heavenly region, and the nine nether heavenly region.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>Many people sighed. This was too crazy!</p><p>Everyone knew that they had underestimated Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming was almost invincible now!</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Ming, Lu Ming…</p><p>Every corner and every force in the Tai Qing heavenly region was talking about this name…</p><p>Lu Ming’s reputation had reached its peak.</p><p>After that, all the forces began to send people to the Hunyuan, ten thousand spirit, and nine Serenities heavenly domains.</p><p>These three heavenly regions had been occupied by the alien races for countless years.</p><p>As for the foreign races, they cultivated differently from the beings of the heaven realm. The treasures they needed were also very different at times.</p><p>There might be some treasures in these three heavenly regions that the alien races couldn’t use, but they were very useful to the living beings in the heaven realm.</p><p>Therefore, there must be many precious treasures in the three heavenly regions waiting for people to explore.</p><p>Countless beings swarmed into the three heavenly regions and began to pick and excavate the treasures.</p><p>At the passageway between the two realms, the two armies had been in a stalemate.</p><p>Lu Ming went into closed-door cultivation. He came out after a few months.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained something from the previous battle and his understanding of the battle character formula had deepened.</p><p>However, he still did not break through the bottleneck.</p><p>There seemed to be a barrier that was blocking him and was difficult to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that as long as the ‘battle character formula’ broke through the bottleneck, its power would definitely increase greatly. It would allow his combat strength to enter a new realm.</p><p>not enough. We need to continue the battle!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then took a step forward and walked toward the alien tribe Army.</p><p>Lu Ming attracted the attention of countless people the moment he moved.</p><p>” Where is Lu Ming going?”</p><p>could it be that we’re going to fight the evil god tribe again? ”</p><p>Many people were guessing and watching from afar.</p><p>This was especially so for those who had arrived later. They had not seen Lu</p><p>Ming in action earlier and could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming has come to challenge you. Evil god race, who wants to come out and fight? ”</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and stood in front of the alien army.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread throughout the alien army.</p><p>The non-human army fell silent.</p><p>“The evil god tribe is so big, yet no one dares to fight them? What a disappointment!”</p><p>Lu Ming said again.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Many of the evil god tribe members gritted their teeth. However, no one stepped out to fight.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. Other than the unrivaled powerhouse, everyone else had come to die.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying auras erupted from the non-human army, and a few non-human</p><p>Kings stepped out with cold eyes.</p><p>“You finally dare to come out. Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the few non-human Kings.</p><p>“Such arrogance, I’ll go and meet him!”</p><p>One of the Kings roared.</p><p>be careful. Lu Ming is really very powerful!</p><p>The alien king who was the first to fight with Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“I will be careful!”</p><p>The non-human King nodded. He took a step forward and appeared not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>They had no choice but to accept Lu Ming’s challenge.</p><p>“You’re alone? No, let’s do another one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, looking very unhappy.</p><p>He was really unhappy. A non-human King wasn’t much of a threat to him.</p><p>“Arrogant, kill!”</p><p>The non-human King flew into a rage at being looked down upon by Lu Ming.</p><p>He charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The heavenly Dao soldier used by this King was a long spear. The long spear</p><p>pierced through the air and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his great desolation spear and charged at the other party.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The two of them continued to collide with each other, causing a deafening boom to ring out. One after another, spear radiance and spear shadows crisscrossed, piercing through the heavens and earth. It was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>terrifying, so terrifying!</p><p>“This power is not something we can resist!”</p><p>“Is this the battle strength of an unrivaled expert?”</p><p>It was the first time for many of the beings in the heaven realm to see the unparalleled experts fight, and they were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming and the non-human King exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>At this time, the non-human King was at a disadvantage.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not hold back. He used his full strength.</p><p>The power of his body and the Dao of domination pushed the battle formula to its limit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
