This Silver Eagle was not afraid of the metal ball. Then, wouldn’t they be finished?</p><p>Being ignored by the silver Condor, the metal ball was furious. It seemed to feel that its dignity had been challenged. Its body swelled up, and its eyes were wide open. Its mouth was full of fangs, and it bit down.</p><p>At the same time, two tentacles stretched out of its body, which was like liquid metal, and waved vigorously, as if threatening the silver Condor.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er didn’t even dare to breathe. They stood there, motionless. Now, he had to rely on the metal ball!</p><p>If the metal ball couldn’t scare off the enemy, they would be in danger.</p><p>Fortunately, the silver Condor finally reacted. After its cold eyes swept over Lu Ming and the rest, it turned around, let out a long hiss, flapped its wings and left.</p><p>Not only that, even the other flying desolate beasts in the surrounding area also left.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest heaved a long sigh of relief. They felt a chill on their backs and they were drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The metal ball shrunk and turned into a round metal ball again. It jumped around in front of Lu Ming, as if it was showing off its achievements.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the metal ball and flew to the sky.</p><p>This time, they were not in any danger. They flew all the way to the sky above the atmosphere and approached the outer s.p.a.ce before they stopped.</p><p>There were no more desolate beasts here, nor were there any other powerful cultivators. Tong Xi er took out the starry sky battleship. After entering the battleship, it turned into a stream of light and flew out of the atmosphere, charging into the vast starry sky.</p><p>After entering the starry sky, they heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Many things had happened on this trip to myriad Gold Star, and they had finally left without any danger. ‘I’ll come again when my cultivation level is higher!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This was a treasure land. He could hunt for a large number of metallic desolate beast. cores. Moreover, Lu Ming had a treasure like the metal ball. The efficiency of hunting for beast cores was amazing,</p><p>However, they definitely couldn’t come in the near future. It wasn’t just because of the beast tide. After the beast tide, the experts of the other forces would probably return to the myriad Gold Star and look for them. Alter a few years, when his cultivation was higher, he would come back.</p><p>Then, they sorted out the storage rings they had obtained from the enemy. They found some beast cores and divine crystals.</p><p>He would organize the items and sell the beast cores when he returned to the righteous Army. Then, be would split them equally.</p><p>Time pa.s.sed by quickly, and after a month, they had returned to true heavenstar.</p><p>It was a place in the righteous Army that specialized in buying, selling, and even exchanging treasures.</p><p>After returning to true heavenstar, Tong Xi er brought. Lu Ming and the rest here and sold all the metal beast.</p><p>cores.</p><p>In addition to their spoils, they had a total of 120000 divine crystals.</p><p>“One hundred and twenty thousand divine crystals. We will take thirty thousand each!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and began to divide it equally.</p><p>no, I only need 10000. This time, it’s all thanks to you guys. I didn’t do much!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er quickly refused, her face slightly red.</p><p>This time, she really did not put in much effort. Whether it was Lu Ming, Kic nianqing, or Xic nianjun, they were all more powerful than her. Iler contribution was the least, so she was a little embarra.s.sed to take ten thousand divine crystals.</p><p>“We agreed that we would split the divine crystals equally. Since we agreed, we naturally have to keep our word!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the thirty thousand divine crystals to Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>Lu Ming was already very satisfied with the metal ball. If Tong Xi ‘er had not brought them there, he would not have been able to get it.</p><p>However, Tong Xi ‘er still refused and only accepted 20000 divine crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll return the interplanetary warship then. You guys have a chat!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘cr said goodbye and left.</p><p>“One hundred thousand divine crystals left…</p><p>Lu Ming took out the remaining divine crystals.</p><p>“Just give me 30000!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xie nianjun took a storage ring with thirty thousand divine crystals and left</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Xie nianging were left. Xie nianging took 30000 Yuan, while Lu Ming kept. 40000 Yuan. with these divine crystals, I should be able to break through quickly!</p><p>Xie nianging smiled.</p><p>She had devoured the memories of her past life, and her cultivation speed was astonishing. Her comprehension of the cultivation path was especially smooth.</p><p>Therefore, as long as she had the resources, she could break through very quickly.</p><p>However, Xie nianjun had an even greater advantage. When she fused with her past life, it was equivalent to her past life being reborn. She almost didn’t need to comprehend it again. Her breakthrough was even faster and there was almost no bottleneck.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while before returning to their rooms to cultivate.</p><p>On this trip to myriad Gold Star, after a series of battles, Lu Ming had made great progress. His comprehension of the battle character formula and the way of the Dominator had both improved greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that he would be able to break through soon,</p><p>Lu Ming placed the metal ball in his room and focused on cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a year had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body, which had been meditating for a year, suddenly exuded a strong suction force. The divine Qi between heaven and earth frantically gathered towards his body and then rushed into it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and a pile of divine crystals appeared. They exploded continuously and turned into rich divine Qi that was absorbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The world Energy and the ruler’s energy in Lu Ming’s body began to surge and quickly became rich.</p><p>A few days later, the aura on Lu Ming’s body rose sharply. Then, he slowly went into hiding.</p><p>Buzzwww.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes. There were two bright and dazzling beams of light in his eyes.</p><p>“Four star heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>After training on the myriad Gold Star and cultivating in scclusion for a year, Lu Ming had another</p><p>breakthrough.</p><p>Of course, this was because Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still low. He was at the heavenly Emperor realm. Moreover, the cultivation environment of the desolate universe was much better than that of the heaven realm. That was why he could break through so quickly.</p><p>If he was in the heaven realm, it would be impossible to break through in such a short time.</p><p>Of course, if he reached the void G.o.d Realm in the future, it wouldn’t be that easy</p><p>break through.</p><p>It was very difficult to break through to each level of the ethereal G.o.d Realm unless one was a heaven-defying genius with the help of some rare natural treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilitics had undoubtedly increased again after he reached the four-star heavenly Emperor level. Now, if he activated the double combat strength, he could casily kill a third level void G.o.d Realm cxistence.</p><p>He could even fight against a fourth level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and stretched his back. A dense burst of explosions came from his body.</p><p>“Eh, this fellow…”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and realized that the metal ball was lying limply on the ground. II. looked listless and</p><p>had almost turned into a pool of liquid.</p><p>“This guy, could it be that he didn’t cat anything and ended up like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess and a piece of metal beast core appeared in his hand.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming still had dozens of scattered beast cores that he had not sold.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
