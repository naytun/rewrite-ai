Its body was covered in scales and its hind legs were thick and strong. However, its front legs were very short and small, which were curled up in front of its body.</p><p>His head was somewhat like a lizard’s. His mouth was incomparably huge and was filled with terrifying fangs. His hind legs were running wildly at an astonishing speed.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise. I was emitting a terrifying Dragon’s might.</p><p>Lu Ming did not get entangled with the other party. He flew</p><p>full speed.</p><p>Right now, he hadn’t activated the double combat strength, so he wasn’t a match for a second level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>After flying for a while, the creature stopped when it saw that could not catch up with Lu Ming. It did not continue to pursue him.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he did not dare to be careless. He retracted his aura and slowed down. Who knew if there were other powerful existences in this barbaric mountain range?</p><p>As expected, after flying for a short while, Lu Ming saw another huge creature. It was similar to the one before, but its aura was more terrifying. It had reached the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had discovered it carly on and avoided it from far away.</p><p>‘I’ll ask senior ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>With a thought from Lu Ming.</p><p>shadow flashed and the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon had been waiting vigilantly. The moment he appeared, he immediately scanned the surroundings. When he saw that La Ming was alone, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>La Ming, what happened? Did you manage to escape?”</p><p>Zu long was shocked.</p><p>This time, he was really going all out and the chances of success were not high. He had even prepared himself for the outcome of Lu Ming failing and all of them being captured.</p><p>At that moment, he saw that Lu Ming was alone in the wild mountains. Naturally, he was extremely surprised. ‘Senior, I was lucky enough to take the first step!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately recounted the situation.</p><p>“The son of the yuanluo Palace Master?</p><p>Zu Long’s eyes moved.</p><p>seems like he is the son of the yuanluo Palace Master!”</p><p>He had been in the heaven realm for countless years, while Kang long had only cultivated for about 500 years. Zu long naturally did not know about Kang long.</p><p>‘Lu Ming, you must keep this Kang long in your hands. We are still on the Umbra star. The origin Luo Palace will definitely send a large number of experts to hunt you down. He might be useful at a critical moment!” Zulong said.</p><p>“Senior, then how do we leave the dark underworld star?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the dark underworld star is extremely huge. It’s much bigger than the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm combined. If we want to leave the dark underworld star and head to other vital planets, we must take the s.p.a.ce teleportation array!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Then we can use Kang long to threaten him, then take the teleportation formation and leave this place…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“You can’t!”</p><p>Zu long shook his head and sighed. the starry sky teleportation formation must be guarded by a terrifying existence. If you encounter an existence above the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm, I’m afraid that even Kang Long’s threat will be useless. That kind of existence is simply too powerful. I reckon they can kill you before you can even react. They can even annihilate your soul before you can kill Kang long!</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>in the ethereal G.o.d Realm, each realm is stronger than the previous. The difference is too big. If you encounter a true G.o.d, I’m afraid he can kill you with just one thought!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>it seems that my strength is at the bottom level in this primal universe!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little helpless.</p><p>In the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm, his strength was already at the peak. However, as soon as he came to the primeval universe, he found that he was too weak. Any expert or a giant beast he encountered in the wild was stronger than him.</p><p>Ile still had a long way to go on his path of cultivation!</p><p>Before the martial G.o.d Realm, it was only the first step of cultivation. Becoming a martial G.o.d was the second step of cultivation.</p><p>The virtual G.o.d Realm was only the starting point of the second step. There were still true G.o.ds, heavenly G.o.ds, and divine kings, each stronger than the last.</p><p>He really didn’t know how terrifying an existence that had reached the G.o.dking realm would be. He probably could destroy a small world like the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm with a casual breath.</p><p>“Senior, can we directly cross the starry sky and head to other planets?”</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his thoughts and asked again.</p><p>“Crossing the starry sky?”</p><p>Zu long shook his head and said with a bitter smile, the starry sky is full of dangers. An ordinary virtual G.o.d will probably explode and die once they enter the starry sky, True G.o.d Realm existences can stay in the starry sky for a short time, but they can’t cross the starry sky!</p><p>to cross the starry sky and enter another life planet from one life planet, one must at least be a heavenly G.o.d!</p><p>“Heavenly G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless and gave up on this plan,</p><p>however, one doesn’t have to rely on one’s own cultivation to cross the starry sky. In the primeval universe, there’s a kind of warship that can cross the starry sky. However, it’s so precious that ordinary people can’t have it!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Then what should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed deeply,</p><p>You can’t go to the teleportation formation!</p><p>If he couldn’t cross the starry sky, how was he going to leave this place?</p><p>He didn’t have much time left. He only had one year. If he couldn’t leave after one year, the small world in his body would merge with the primeval universe.</p><p>Not only him, but all the people who cultivated the nomological laws and cultivated small worlds in the heaven realm would do the same. At that time, the fluctuations would be huge. If he stayed on planet dark underworld, he would probably be sensed by the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>It was too dangerous to stay on the shadowed star. He had to leave the planet within a year.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the distance, a huge creature roared and strolled through the mountains, causing the mountains to</p><p>tremble.</p><p>“Desolate beast!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon looked at the huge creature and muttered.</p><p>“Desolate beast?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. Could it be that I was not a divine beast?</p><p>in the primal universe, there are two types of beasts. One is the G.o.dly beast, and the other is the desolate</p><p>beast!</p><p>G.o.dly beasts are very intelligent. Just like humans, they created all kinds of cultivation techniques. All kinds of races gathered and spread throughout the primal universe, forming powerful forces!</p><p>as for desolate beasts, their intelligence is very low. They cultivate according to their instincts and like to stay in the wild mountains!</p><p>actually, in the very beginning, desolate beasts and divine beasts were originally the same race. It was just that as time pa.s.sed, they slowly split up!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He understood.</p><p>this is a wild dragon. It’s an extremely powerful existence among the wild beasts. It’s said that in the early days, the wild dragon and the true dragon were of the same race!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>Then, the two of them discussed for a while. They didn’t have a better idea for the time being, so they decided to go to some places where people gathered and inquire about the news before making the next</p><p>preparations.</p><p>After that, the ancestral Dragon returned to Lu Ming’s small world. Lu Ming continued to fly.</p><p>It took Lu Ming more than ten days to fly out of the mountain range. He then concealed his aura and changed</p><p>his appearance. He chose a random direction and flew forward.</p><p>The surface area of the dark underworld star was simply too large.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s speed here was a hundred times slower than in the heaven realm, his current cultivation level allowed him to fly at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However,</p><p>still took La Ming a few more days before he saw a city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
