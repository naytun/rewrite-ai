Lu Ming and the rest did not stay and left the place immediately.</p><p>Following that, they were much more cautious and went to remote places to avoid encountering other martial artists.</p><p>The next ten days were very peaceful. Nothing major happened. They were able to hunt desolate beasts in реасе.</p><p>With the help of the metal ball, their speed of hunting desolate beasts had greatly increased.</p><p>However, they realized something. The metal ball could deal with fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts, but it would be very difficult to deal with fifth-level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts. It could scare the other party, but if the other party turned and ran, the metal ball could not catch up.</p><p>Therefore, the wild beasts they hunted were all below the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming, Xie niangqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er also went all out to kill the dire beasts and hunt for their beast corcs.</p><p>After all, if it relied on the metal ball alone. I would have to take half of the beast cores hunted.</p><p>If they worked together, their efficiency would naturally be much higher.</p><p>In ten days ‘time, together with the beast cores they had hunted before, they could probably sell all of them for around 100000 divine crystals. was definitely a big harvest.</p><p>On this day, after the metal ball swallowed a beast core, its body suddenly emitted a brilliant light. A powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>“Could this be … He’s about to advance?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>Could it be that the metal ball would be able to advance if it kept devouring the beast core?</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>The metal ball was like a balloon, swelling and shrinking. This repeated for a few hours before it finally stabilized, and the aura of the metal ball also increased.</p><p>“Second level of the void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming understood that the metal ball had really advanced and reached second-level void G.o.d-level. Lu Ming was overjoyed. The metal ball had advanced and it would undoubtedly be more powerful. In the future, it would be faster to hunt dire beasts.</p><p>While they were hunting wild beasts, a figure rushed out of a hidden cave. It was the bald man from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>After more than ten days, his injuries had finally completely recovered. The side effects of burning Shen power had also completely stabilized.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er, and that kid, don’t think of having an easy time. If I can’t have him, you can’t either!</p><p>The bald man said ferociously. Then, his figure flashed and he left.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, there was another group of people hunting desolate beasts. There were about a dozen of them. This group of people came from another force, the Fengyun Hall.</p><p>Fengyun Hall was a force that was not weaker than the yuanluo Palace and the zhengtian Army.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, an old man leading the Fengyun Hall looked in one direction with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>brother Feng, you’re really sharp. I’m impressed!</p><p>With a chuckle, a figure emerged. It was the bald man from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>“Kang Bing, is that you? What, do you want to take advantage of my Fengyun Hall?”</p><p>The old man from Fengyun Hall scanned the surroundings with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>The other people of Fengyun Hall also looked around vigilantly.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Occan is a chaotic place with countless big and small powers. It’s a common occurrence for these powers to kill each other.</p><p>On the myriad Gold Star, it was common to fight for beast cores, so they naturally had to be on high alert. brother Feng, you must be joking. I’m here to tell you a great opportunity!</p><p>The bald man laughed.</p><p>“A great opportunity?”</p><p>The corners of the old man’s mouth curled up slightly. He obviously didn’t believe it. “If there’s an opportunity, why would you be so kind as to tell me? He would have taken it for himself long ago!”</p><p>this opportunity isn’t in my hands. It was taken away by a few kids from the righteous Army. They obtained a type of metal ball that has spirituality. It can suppress other metal desolate beasts on the myriad Gold Star and then s.n.a.t.c.h their beast cores. It’s extremely efficient!</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>“What? There was actually such a treasure? Kang Bing, you’re not lying to me, are you?”</p><p>The old man still didn’t believe him.</p><p>it’s up to you to believe it or not. The news has been delivered. There are only four people in the zhengtian Army, three women and one man. They are all young people. Why don’t you try to see if it’s true?”</p><p>The bald man laughed, and then his figure flashed and left.</p><p>“Big brother li, what should we do? Is this Kang Bing telling the truth?”</p><p>Someone asked the old man.</p><p>there’s actually such a powerful metallic lifeform that can suppress the other metallic desolate beasts. It’s better to believe it than not. If it’s true, then we’ll be rich. We’ll immediately find those fellows from the</p><p>righteous Army!</p><p>The old man ordered.</p><p>After that, the bald man shuttled through the land to find people from other forces and spread the news.</p><p>Most of them, like the old man of Fengyun Hall, would rather look for it.</p><p>More and more people joined in the search for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were unaware of this and continued to hunt for beast cores.</p><p>With the advancement of the metal ball, their speed of obtaining beast cores had increased. They could even</p><p>kill fifth-level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts now,</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>One day, as they were moving forward, Xie nianjun’s eyes suddenly moved.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also sensed it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The figures in front of him flickered, and six figures appeared.</p><p>These six people were from the human-snake hybrid clan and the ox-head clan.</p><p>The leader of the group, an old serpent-man, swept a dark gaze at. Lu Ming and the rest. His gaze eventually</p><p>landed on the metal ball on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“It’s just as Kang Bing said. There really is a metallic life form like this!”</p><p>The serpent-man elder’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>They came from a small force and only six of them were on the myriad Gold Star. When they heard news</p><p>about Kang Bing, they immediately started searching everywhere. Unexpectedly, they found Lu Ming and the</p><p>others first.</p><p>“Brat, hand over that metal ball and we’ll spare your life!”</p><p>The serpent-man elder spoke with a sharp and hoa.r.s.e voice. He swung his tail back and forth threateningly.</p><p>“Are they here for the metal ball?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He immediately thought of the bald man from the origin Hall.</p><p>It must have been the bald man who leaked the news, or he wanted to use someone else to get rid of them.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Among the six of them, the snake-man elder had the highest cultivation base, which was at the 4th level of</p><p>the void G.o.d Realm. The rest of them were all below the 4th level of the void G.o.d Realm, so they were not</p><p>afraid at all.</p><p>“What did you just say? A transformation void martial stage warrior dares to talk to me like this. If you hand</p><p>over the metal ball, I could consider sparing your life. Now, even if you kneel down and beg me, you will still</p><p>die!”</p><p>The serpent-man elder’s voice was extremely cold and filled with killing intent.</p><p>“I’ll kill him!’</p><p>A third-level void G.o.d Realm Minotaur held a battle axe. He arched his body and took a step forward,</p><p>charging toward Lu Ming like an arrow.</p><p>“Go, smash him to death!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the metal ball flew out. At the same time, it expanded rapidly and smashed</p><p>down on the Minotaur’s face.</p><p>22</p><p>Swipe left to continue &gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
