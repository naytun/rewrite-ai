At the same time, the three burly Men in Black armor also exuded auras of a third level void G.o.d Realm. The terrifying aura was like a violent Hurricane, pressing towards Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Leave this old man to me!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianjun spoke, a look of disgust flashing across her eyes.</p><p>Just now, when old man Xiao looked at her with that kind of gaze, she already had the thought of killing him. Whoosh!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xie nianjun broke through old man Xiao’s aura suppression and walked toward him. Old man Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly. To be able to break through his aura so easily, it was not easy. “Little girl, since you’re in such a hurry, I’ll fulfill your wish, hehe!”</p><p>Old man Xiao laughed sinisterly. He reached out with his withered hand and a huge black Hand appeared, grabbing towards Xie nianjun.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Xie nianjun’s band was filled with holy light, which turned into a sword of holy light. With a slash, it cut old man Xiao’s hand in half. Then, the long sword trembled and turned into sword shadows, shrouding old man Xiao.</p><p>“You…</p><p>Old man Xiao was shocked. Xie nianjun’s strength was far beyond his imagination. It was not the combat strength of a 1st. tier void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>ROOM!</p><p>The divine power in his body burst out as a Dragon-headed walking stick appeared in his hand. He attacked Xie nianjun like a storm.</p><p>However, Xie nianjun’s long sword trembled, and sword shadows emerged one after another. In an instant, hundreds of sword shadows appeared and slashed at old man Xiao from all directions.</p><p>Each sword seemed to cut at old man Xiao’s flaws. Old man Xiao’s attack had just burst out, but before it was even halfway out, it was extinguished. He could only retreat to block.</p><p>Xie nianjun followed him, and his sword light expanded again, enveloping his opponent.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it…</p><p>Old man Xiao roared. He was so aggrieved that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>His divine power was definitely not weaker than Xie nianjun’s, but he was completely suppressed by Xie nianjun in the battle. Xic nianjun’s sword-light had completely controlled the situation and the rhythm. He couldn’t use his full strength at all.</p><p>He had never encountered such a situation before. He was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. “This level of control…</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was even more amazed.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s control was so strong that he had the entire battle under control.</p><p>The strength of her Shen power was similar to old man Xiao but in the battle, the situation was one-sided. This was the result of battle techniques and experience. Only with great power could one achieve this.</p><p>Xic nianjun looked to be about the same age as her, but he was able to control the rhythm of the battle so well that she couldn’t help but be amazed.</p><p>“All of you, attack together and kill her, kill her!”</p><p>Old man Xiao bellowed and called the three black-armored brawny men to attack.</p><p>A long spear appeared in each of the three black-armored men’s hands. They circulated their divine power and charged at Xic nianjun.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly. His figure flashed and he rushed out. The sword in his hand slashed violently and enveloped the three black-armored men.</p><p>Clang Clang! Clang!</p><p>After three consecutive collisions, the three black-armored brawny men were forced back.</p><p>“Little Qing, leave one for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed out and continuously cast the battle character formula.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The double combat power of the battle character formula was activated. Lu Ming’s combat strength increased sharply. He took out a divine weapon sword and slashed at one of the burly Men in Black armor.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through, he had not gone all out in the battle. It was a good time. for him to spar with the strong man in Black armor.</p><p>Xie nianqing retracted his sword and gave Lu Ming a strong Man in Black armor.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword slashed at the burly Man in Black armor. There was a loud boom and both of them swayed.</p><p>“Third level void G.o.d Realm is indeed powerful. Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed forward again, launching a storm-like attack.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the burly Man in Black armor were engaged in an intense battle. On the other hand, it was a one-sided battle between Xie nianqing and the other two.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat strength wasn’t much weaker than Xie nianjun’s, so it was easy for him to deal with two third level void G.o.d Realm cultivators.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘cr stood at the side in a daze. She realized that she couldn’t interfere in such a battle at all, and there was no need for her to intervene.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>After a few dozen moves, the two black-armored men were killed, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>“How is that possible? How did this happen?”</p><p>Old man Xiao’s heart trembled. He simply couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation realm was similar to the information he had received previously. However, their combat. strength was completely unrelated to their cultivation realm. It was too terrifying.</p><p>A first level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert could actually suppress him.</p><p>sacred-grade divine power! Peerless genius! Retreat! Retreat…</p><p>Old man Xiao was terrified. Ile wanted to run away, but he realized that he couldn’t escape from Xie nianjun’s sword-light.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>He panicked and became even more vulnerable. Not long after, Xic nianjun’s sword left a deep wound on his body, almost cutting him in half.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s terrifying divine power was running around in his body, making old man Xiao vomit blood and weaken even more.</p><p>As such, he was even less of a match for Xie nianjun.</p><p>Pift!</p><p>Within two moves, old man Xiao’s eyes were cut off by Xic nianjun’s sword light.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Old man Xiao screamed and attacked crazily.</p><p>“Old man, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said coldly. The sword light slashed again, and the next moment, old man Xiao’s head flew off.</p><p>A fourth-level void G.o.d Realm existence had been killed.</p><p>Old man Xiao’s eyes were wide open. He died with his eyes wide open. Ile never thought that he, a dignified fourth level void G.o.d Realm existence, would actually die at the hands of a first level void G.o.d Realm, The brawny man who was fighting with Lu Ming was almost scared to death when he saw that the others were killed. He panicked and Lu Ming seized the opportunity to kill him with one slash.</p><p>At this point, the four experts of the yuanluo Palace had all been killed.</p><p>“My cultivation is still too weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s weakness was his cultivation.</p><p>He was only a three-star heavenly Emperor now. If he broke through to the void G.o.d Realm, it would be a</p><p>piece of cake for him to kill these clowns.</p><p>The few of them kept the storage rings of old man Xiao and the other three.</p><p>“It seems like the yuanluo Palace also has people on the myriad Gold Star. I guess these four are only a part of</p><p>them!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said with a serious expression.</p><p>let’s leave this place first. Be careful in our future actions!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In a flash, the four of them left the place. After that, they did not hunt any wild beasts. They ran for more</p><p>than 100000 miles before stopping and continuing to search for wild beasts to hunt.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day pa.s.sed, and they arrived at a mountain area.</p><p>eh? why aren’t there any dire beasts in this area?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianging, and Xie nianjun nodded. They had patrolled the area earlier and had not encountered</p><p>any dire beasts.</p><p>This area was very quiet.</p><p>£3</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
