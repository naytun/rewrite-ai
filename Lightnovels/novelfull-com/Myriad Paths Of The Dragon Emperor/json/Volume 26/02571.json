It looked even bigger than two world city.</p><p>Lu Ming walked through a huge city gate and entered the city.</p><p>“So many races!”</p><p>After entering the city gate, Lu Ming realized that the streets of the city were filled with people of different</p><p>races.</p><p>At a glance, Lu Ming discovered at least dozens of races.</p><p>Although there were also humans, they had the least.</p><p>“The chaotic astral River is a place where all kinds of races gather. It’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>During the journey, Lu Ming would chat with zu long from time to time. Zu long told Lu Ming many things. about the desolate universe.</p><p>The primeval universe was boundless and had countless life planets.</p><p>In the primal universe, there were countless races, each occupying a large territory.</p><p>These territories were called star territories!</p><p>Under each star area, there were many galaxies, and under each Galaxy, there were many life planets. The yuanluo Palace was located at the edge of the primal universe, in a place called the chaotic astral River. The chaotic astral River could be said to be one of the most barren galaxies in the entire primal universe. The powerful forces didn’t care about this place at all. Therefore, it had become a special Galaxy. Those from various races who can’t survive, escapees, or people who are being hunted, will all come to the chaotic astral River.</p><p>Thus, the chaotic astral River has countless races.</p><p>This place was filled with chaos, and killing could be seen everywhere.</p><p>Of course, the chaotic astral River has also formed various powers of different sizes. These powers can also be seen fighting each other everywhere.</p><p>When Lu Ming first heard that this place was one of the most barren places the entire universe, he was shocked.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the cultivation environment here was already extremely amazing. It was dozens of times better than the heaven realm.</p><p>Such a place was actually the most barren place in the entire universe. Then, how amazing would the places with good cultivation environments be?</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it</p><p>He felt that the primeval universe would be more exciting than the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm.</p><p>What about the great void Holy dynasty?</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of the great void Holy dynasty that Bai Ya had mentioned.</p><p>The master of netherworld mountain, Jing Yu, was from the great void Holy dynasty. But where was the great void Holy dynasty?</p><p>Lu Ming had asked zu long about it, but zu long shook his head. He had never heard of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon was born and raised in the chaotic astral River. According to what he said, he had never left the chaotic astral River in his entire life.</p><p>Lu Ming wandered around the streets. There were all kinds of races here, so naturally, no one paid attention</p><p>to him.</p><p>“Eh? It seems like there aren’t many virtual G.o.ds?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and realized that most of the people on the street were at the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>In the primal universe, there were also the void prying stage, true void stage, void interpretation stage, and void transformation stage.</p><p>There weren’t many people who had reached the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>In particular, Lu Ming had seen most of those at the transformation void martial stage and demiG.o.ds. It seemed that it was not easy to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm in the prehistoric universe. Lu Ming walked around and found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming would wander around the city or go to some restaurants to find out more. Lu Ming knew that only the two largest cities had teleportation formations. However, both cities were guarded by a large number of experts from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>“Do you want to take a risk?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Ile wanted to disguise himself in front of the teleportation formation and see if he could take the opportunity to slip through.</p><p>However, he wasn’t confident. Although his divine breath technique was effective in the heaven realm, this was the desolate universe. There were too many experts. Who knew if those experts would see through the disguise of the divine breath technique?</p><p>Moreover, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the effect of the divine breath technique became less and less. It became more and more difficult to conceal his aura.</p><p>This was natural. The stronger one’s cultivation was, the more powerful one’s aura would be. It would be more difficult to change and conceal one’s aura, unless one had a more exquisite aura concealment technique. let’s observe for a while and see if there are any other ways. If there’s no other way, we can only take a risk! Lu Ming made a decision.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stayed in the city, cultivating and thinking of ways.</p><p>In this place, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was much faster than i the heaven realm, Lu Ming would often use Jing Yu’s portrait to comprehend the will of the ruler, and his progress was rapid.</p><p>However, there was a seal on Jing Yu’s scroll. Lu Ming had not been able to open it, probably because his cultivation level was not high enough.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had pa.s.sed.</p><p>In two months, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the path of domination had improved by a large margin. It was comparable to ten years of cultivation in the heaven realm.</p><p>He believed that it would not be long before his cultivation base would rise again.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was walking on the streets when he suddenly looked up at the sky. Buzzzzzz! BuzzId</p><p>In the sky, a few beams of light. Ilashed by. They were virtual G.o.d-level Masters.</p><p>“In the past few days, there have been more and more experts in the vicinity!”</p><p>“Indeed, they seem to be looking for someone!”</p><p>Around them, many people were discussing.</p><p>“Could it be that the experts from the yuanluo Palace are looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>Since he had captured Kang long, it was only natural that the origin Luo Palace would not let him go and would send a large number of experts to hunt him down.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming became even more careful. However, in the next few days, Lu Ming discovered that the number of experts in the city had decreased instead of increasing. There was a trend of more and more. Some people even walked into the city and looked around with sharp eyes.</p><p>It was as if the other party had locked onto the city.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the inn, summoned zu long, and told him about the matter.</p><p>not good, the enemy must have locked onto you. You just came out of the heaven realm and haven’t a.s.similated with the primeval universe, so you must have a strong aura of the heaven realm. It won’t be difficult for the enemy to lock onto you as long as they spend some time studying you!</p><p>Zu Long’s expression changed drastically,</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>however, the other party didn’t find you immediately. This means that they can only determine the approximate area and can’t accurately determine you. Now, you have o leave this place as soon s possible!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He kept the ancestral Dragon into the small world and left the inn immediately. He headed out of the city and soon left the city gate. He chose a random direction and flew forward.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>After Lu Ming had flown for a while, two people flew toward him and one of them shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart jumped!</p><p>They were two middle-aged men, both at the ethereal G.o.d Realm. One of them was holding a crystal ball, which was shining with a weak light.</p><p>The two middle-aged men flew toward Lu Ming, When they neared him, the crystal ball suddenly shone</p><p>brightly.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The two middle-aged men’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately dashed out and flew rapidly in another direction.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The two middle-aged burly men chased after Lu Ming at top speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
