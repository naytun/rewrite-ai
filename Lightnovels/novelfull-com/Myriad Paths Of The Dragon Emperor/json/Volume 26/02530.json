At times, they fought in the sky, and at other times, they fought in the depths of the void.</p><p>When existences at their level attacked with all their might, they could really destroy the world. If they fought on the ground, an entire heavenly region would be destroyed by them.</p><p>A small continent like the divine wilderness continent could probably be reduced to ashes with a single move.</p><p>Soon, the two of them had exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>King of the outsiders, is this all you have? how disappointing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned indifferent. His fighting spirit and combat strength grew stronger and stronger, and he began to suppress the king of the non-human race.</p><p>‘1 How is that possible?”</p><p>The non-human King was extremely shocked.</p><p>He could clearly sense that Lu Ming had yet to step into demigod-level as he had yet to produce divine power.</p><p>His cultivation level was lower than his, but his combat strength was stronger than his. He was actually slowly suppressing him. This was too terrifying.</p><p>The non-human King growled and activated the divine power in his body to the maximum. Unfortunately, he was still no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming’s casual spear attack could explode with shocking power and terrifying combat strength.</p><p>He was forced to retreat.</p><p>“The battle symbol art is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. At this moment, he had activated the battle formula to the extreme. He had reached his current limit. The more he fought, the stronger he became. He had already gained the upper hand.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Countless non-humans muttered to themselves, finding it hard to accept this.</p><p>In their hearts, the king of the non-human race was an invincible existence, a symbol of invincibility.</p><p>But now, he was going to be defeated, and he was defeated by a young man from the heaven realm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few more moves, the non-human King was swept by Lu Ming’s spear radiance and his body flew out horizontally. A bloody wound appeared on his body and blood flowed out.</p><p>“It seems that you can’t kill me today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully and continued to attack the other party.</p><p>The alien King let out a long roar and fought Lu Ming with all his might. Unfortunately, after more than ten moves, he was sent flying by Lu Ming and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Once he was at a disadvantage and was injured by Lu Ming, his combat strength would be weakened and he would not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The faces of countless members of the evil god race turned pale.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Even a King was not Lu Ming’s match. Should they retreat?</p><p>Otherwise, when the king of the outsiders was defeated, they would be the ones to die!</p><p>At this moment, space cracked open and another figure appeared.</p><p>This figure was also wearing a crown and had a shocking aura.</p><p>Another King of the outsiders had arrived!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The non-human King descended and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger as he fought with this non- human King.</p><p>The non-human King from before had also returned.</p><p>Two non-human Kings were fighting Lu Ming.</p><p>The two non-human Kings working together were too terrifying. In this world, who could defeat them except for the martial God Realm?</p><p>Legend had it that the peerless chaos Supreme Emperor and the undying Supreme Emperor had been besieged by two kings of the non-human race and eventually died.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a disadvantage as he was surrounded by two kings.</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming could only retaliate but not counterattack.</p><p>“Yes, that’s it, that’s it…”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid. Instead, he was even more surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming felt an immense pressure as he was surrounded by two non-human Kings. Under this pressure, his understanding of the battle character formula was rapidly improving.</p><p>A slow comprehension was not as fast as a crisis.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his spear and unleashed all his strength. His entire body was covered in the purple-gold Dominator’s power. He continued to activate the battle symbol art as he fought the two kings.</p><p>Although the two kings had the upper hand, Lu Ming was as steady as a rock. The great desolation spear danced in an airtight manner. They could not break through Lu Ming’s defense in a short time.</p><p>“How is that possible? This brat is even more difficult to deal with than the primal Chaos Emperor and the undying Emperor!”</p><p>A non-human King thought in shock.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged a hundred moves. Lu Ming was still steadily blocking their attacks.</p><p>At this moment, the Army of the heaven realm had finally arrived in the direction of the abysmal heavenly domain. They were densely packed and surging toward this side.</p><p>However, they stopped when they were far away.</p><p>The battle between Lu Ming and the two foreign tribe Kings was too terrifying. The void was filled with destructive storms, and they did not dare to get close.</p><p>“Heavens, is that the king of the outsiders?”</p><p>yes, two alien Kings. Lu Ming is fighting two alien Kings!</p><p>Some of the heaven realm’s experts were watching from afar. When they saw the people in the battle, they were stunned.</p><p>The Army of the heavenly realm was in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually fighting two kings of the non-human race.</p><p>During this period of time, they had refreshed their understanding of Lu Ming.</p><p>In the beginning, many people had speculated that Lu Ming had the strength of a peak heavenly Emperor. However, they now realized that it was far from the case.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming have the strength of an invincible master, but he could also fight against two alien Kings.</p><p>How many people in this world could fight two non-human Kings alone?</p><p>this is bad. Lu Ming is at a disadvantage. If this goes on, will he be defeated? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say, but we’ve already reported to the invincible Masters of our heaven realm. Soon, our invincible Masters will arrive!</p><p>Some people in the heaven realm were discussing in low voices.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>A part of the void suddenly split open, and a terrifying sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this sword light was shockingly strong. Without a doubt, another demigod-level existence had made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He waved the great desolation spear at high speed and covered his body with a layer of defense.</p><p>However, in the face of this sudden attack and the attacks of the other two non- human Kings, Lu Ming was still struggling.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword hit Lu Ming’s long spear. Lu Ming was sent flying and he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The heaven realm powerhouses ‘expressions changed.</p><p>Sila!</p><p>The space cracked open, and a figure walked out.</p><p>Without a doubt, it was another alien King.</p><p>The three non-human Kings descended and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“This person must be eliminated!”</p><p>The first non-human King said. He was too shocked and even a little frightened. If Lu Ming was allowed to continue growing, he did not know how far he would go.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>Another non-human King said.</p><p>hahaha, Three Kings of the non-human race actually want to join forces to deal with a junior of our heaven realm. Are you not afraid of being laughed at by the world? ”</p><p>A sneer was heard, and a figure suddenly appeared in front of the heavenly realm Army.</p><p>This person’s body was filled with endless lightning, as if he was the embodiment of lightning.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder Emperor! Heavenly Thunder Emperor is here!</p><p>The beings of the heavenly realm were overjoyed.</p><p>” Heavenly lightning!”</p><p>The eyes of the three non-human Kings narrowed.</p><p>“If you guys want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>The heavenly Thunder Emperor said. He then turned into a bolt of lightning and charged toward a non-human King. The two of them began an intense battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
