From One World to another world, the distance was too long.</p><p>Not only did he have to have a powerful force to travel through the void, but he also had to face a terrifying spatial storm.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>Lu Ming shuttled through the void at an astonishing speed. He felt as if the endless void flashed past him. However, at the same time, a terrifying void storm energy formed in the void and continuously attacked him.</p><p>This kind of energy could even pass through Lu Ming’s body and attack his dantian and sea of consciousness. It would cause a terrifying impact on the small world or the world in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>This was also why ordinary peak heavenly emperors and even invincible powerhouses could travel through the void and enter another world from One World. However, they could only move alone and couldn’t bring anyone else. This was because if you brought someone else along, they would also be killed by the energy of the Netherstorm.</p><p>It would be useless even if he hid it in a small world or an Eden treasure.</p><p>Of course, if a martial God had a small world in his body, he could still resist. However, the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor didn’t cultivate the nomological system and didn’t have a small world.</p><p>Therefore, when zu long brought the people from the prison-guarding field to the heaven realm, it was the world formed by the prison-guarding stele that could do it.</p><p>I wonder if my ruler’s power can withstand the impact of the void storm. I’ll give it a try!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He gathered the ruler’s power to the periphery of the small world in his dantian and enveloped the small world.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The terrifying void storm continued to bombard the ruler’s power, but it didn’t penetrate the small world.</p><p>“It’s effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that he could bring people from One World to another?</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>The void around them flashed continuously. Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast.</p><p>After at most one to two hours, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly flickered. He swung his palm forward and the void split open. Lu Ming walked out.</p><p>What came into view was a majestic city that was not inferior to two world city.</p><p>This was returning bamboo city!</p><p>And Lu Ming appeared on the battlefield outside the city of the ruins of end.</p><p>In just an hour or two, Lu Ming had arrived at the battlefield of the ultimate from the netherworld realm, crossing several heavenly realms.</p><p>Lu Ming did not enter the city of the ruins of end. Instead, he headed toward the evil god tribe’s military camp.</p><p>“Then… It seems to be Lu Ming!”</p><p>it’s indeed Lu Ming. He’s in return bamboo city. Didn’t he kill his way to the abysmal heavenly region? ”</p><p>‘Could it be that he is going to attack the evil god tribe’s military camp? Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Many people in return bamboo city were excited to see Lu Ming. They flew out of the city wall and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in the air at an extremely fast speed. Not long after, an endless military camp appeared in front of him. This was the evil god tribe’s military camp that was stationed at the entrance of the ancient demon heaven domain. BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. When he approached the enemy’s military camp, he immediately pulled the trigger.</p><p>An incomparably huge spear descended from the sky, blasting down toward the evil god tribe’s military camp with an extremely terrifying might.</p><p>“Activate the formation, activate the formation!”</p><p>A series of roars rang out from the evil god tribe’s military camp. The entire camp was filled with a dazzling light that formed a light barrier that enveloped the entire camp.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming’s spear was about to strike the light shield, two shocking auras burst out from the evil god tribe’s military camp. Two terrifying attacks soared into the sky and struck Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled and was sent flying back.</p><p>“Two demigods!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>From the looks of it, the evil god tribe was well prepared. They had sent invincible figures to guard their camp, afraid that it would be the same as the last time and their camp would be broken through.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the non-human camp, two loud roars were heard. Then, two figures rushed out with a terrifying aura toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed. He charged forward and fought with his opponent.</p><p>Although the two non-human Kings were able to suppress Lu Ming and gain the upper hand, Lu Ming was able to counterattack once every ten moves this time. He had improved significantly.</p><p>The battle between the two parties was extremely intense. After exchanging a few hundred moves, Lu Ming finally retreated.</p><p>“Damn it, this Lu Ming is really terrifying!”</p><p>he’s using us to train himself. The next time he comes to challenge us, we don’t have to care about him. We just have to focus on defense!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The two unparalleled powerful beings of the foreign races returned to the evil god tribe’s military camp.</p><p>Lu Ming found a secret place and went into seclusion to comprehend.</p><p>After cultivating for a period of time, Lu Ming came out of seclusion. This time, he felt that the ‘battle character formula’ had improved again. He was only a step away from breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p>It was as if he could break through at any time, but he couldn’t, as if he was lacking something.</p><p>“Find someone else to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming went to the non-human camp for a challenge, but the unrivaled powerhouse of the non-human race refused to fight.</p><p>In a fit of rage, Lu Ming attacked the non-human camp. The two unparalleled powerhouses of the non-human race joined forces and blocked Lu Ming’s attack. However, they merely defended and did not take the initiative to attack.</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he vomited blood.</p><p>It was obvious that the non-human expert had seen through his intentions.</p><p>Lu Ming paced in front of the alien camp for a while but could not find a chance to fight.</p><p>After that, he returned to the netherworld realm to challenge them. It was the same. The alien races did not fight.</p><p>As long as they could stall for time until the non-human divine ancestor and sacred ancestor bloodheart recovered, they would be able to fightback.</p><p>“You don’t want to fight? Then I’ll kill my way to your side!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with madness. Then, he tore open the space and rushed directly towards the evil god World.</p><p>The evil god World was very far from the nine Heavens domain, but there was a void passage that connected it to the nine Heavens domain.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not want to pass through this void channel. He shuttled through the void directly and rushed toward the evil god World.</p><p>Not long after, when Lu Ming tore open the space again and went out, he had already arrived at the evil god Realm.</p><p>there are still many masters from the prison guard field and the heaven realm in the eternal cage. This time, we’ll save them all!</p><p>The first thing that came to Lu Ming’s mind when he arrived at the evil god Realm was the eternal cage.</p><p>Back then, they had left in a hurry and had only taken a hundred or so people with them. The powerhouses imprisoned in the eternal cage were not just a hundred or so.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming wanted to bring all of them out.</p><p>Anyway, Lu Ming’s way of being a master could protect the small world when he traversed the void.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already outside the eternal cage.</p><p>From a distance, one could see that the eternal cage was covered by a light screen, and at the very top, there was a treasure.</p><p>is that the treasure of the divine ancestor of the non-human race? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>That treasure might be a treasure that surpassed the heavenly Dao soldiers, but it wasn’t at the level of a divine artifact. It was only in the middle of the heavenly Dao soldiers and divine artifacts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
