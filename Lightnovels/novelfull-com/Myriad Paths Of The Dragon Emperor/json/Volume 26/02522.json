The cultivation environment here was much better than many other places.</p><p>Some people who were on good terms with Lu Ming and some other forces came to the Dragon sovereign peak to cultivate. In a short time, a large number of experts had gathered there.</p><p>Lu Ming also gave out the combat weapons he had obtained from netherworld mountain.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming gave the few heavenly emperors who cultivated the immemorial body cultivation a combat weapon that was equivalent to a heavenly Dao soldier.</p><p>As for Lu Ming himself, he sat at the Dragon sovereign peak and cultivated in peace.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Lu shenhuang, and the others were naturally at the Dragon sovereign peak as well.

Lu Ming could actually invite a peak heavenly Emperor to give a lecture. This level of energy was shocking.</p><p>Those forces that had designs on Lu Ming completely extinguished their thoughts.</p><p>Although the treasure was important, he had to be alive to take it.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to the arrival of ten years later.</p><p>Ten years passed in the blink of an eye to experts.</p><p>Ten years later, Lu Ming invited a peak heavenly Emperor from the prison suppression field to give a lecture at the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>This time, there were even more people coming to Dragon Emperor Peak to listen to the Dao.
