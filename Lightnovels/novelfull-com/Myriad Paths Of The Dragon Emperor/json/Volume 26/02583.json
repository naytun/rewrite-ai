Myriad Gold Star is not a planet occupied by our righteous sky Army. This planet is very special. It is completely made of all kinds of metals. The desolate beasts on it are also made of metal. This planct is not occupied by any forces. Many people from the forces can go and hunt desolate beasts!</p><p>that’s why our zhengtian Army doesn’t have a teleportation array that leads directly to the myriad Gold Star. We can only teleport to the closest location to the myriad Gold Star and then fly there on an interplanetary warship!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er explained.</p><p>then, the cost of renting an interstellar warship must be quite high!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>one rent will cost 1000 divine crystals!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>one thousand divine crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The price was shockingly high.</p><p>it can’t be helped. The starry sky battleships are too precious. Our righteous heaven Army only has a dozen of them, and they’re all of the lowest grade. They can’t fly too far. They can only fly for a year in s.p.a.ce. Any further and they won’t be able to!</p><p>besides, after every s.p.a.ce flight, the Starship needs to be maintained. It’s expensive, of course!</p><p>it’s said that some major forces have higher-grade starry sky battleships. The rental fee is even more shocking. However, those starry sky battleships are not only faster, but they can also fly for a longer time and a longer distance in the universe!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er explained.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly. It seemed that he did not know enough about the common knowledge of the primeval universe.</p><p>“Miss Xi ‘er, can you pay for the rent of the Starship first? I’ll pay you back when I earn some divine crystals!” Lu Ming blushed. He was really poor and could not afford to fork out so many divine crystals. “I’m fine!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er smiled and bade Lu Ming farewell.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his residence and looked for Xie nianging. He told him about this and Xie nianqing agreed.</p><p>Then, the two of them went to find Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Xie nianjun agreed without hesitation.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Xie nianjun was also severely lacking divine crystals for cultivation. It was just what she wanted to earn divine crystals by hunting wild beasts.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun arrived at the place where they had agreed t yesterday. Tong Xi er was already waiting there.</p><p>“What beautiful women!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er looked at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun, her eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>meet with Tong Xi er</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er left first, and soon, they arrived at the s.p.a.ce teleportation formation of the righteous Army. The teleportation array in the primal universe looked similar to the teleportation array in the heaven realm and the primordial realm. After they stepped into the teleportation array, they felt the world spin around them, and they disappeared from the teleportation array.</p><p>The journey to myriad Gold Star was not short. They had to change to another teleportation array on the way to the nearest planct to myriad Gold Star, tianguang planet.</p><p>After three transfers, they arrived at tianguang planct.</p><p>Tianguang planet was the closest planet to myriad gold planet among the planets that the righteous heaven Army had occupied. After arriving at tianguang planet, Tong Xi ‘er took out the starry sky battleship. After the four of them entered the battleship, the starry sky battleship broke through the sky and flew towards myriad gold planet.</p><p>The starry sky battleship would take a month to reach the myriad Gold Star, so the four of them cultivated while waiting.</p><p>A month later, a huge planet appeared in front of them.</p><p>In terms of size, this planet was far smaller than the true heavenstar and the underworld star, but it was very special.</p><p>From a distance, it looked like a huge gem suspended in the starry sky, shining brightly.</p><p>According to Tong Xi ‘er’s introduction, most of the materials on myriad Gold Star were all kinds of strange metals.</p><p>Even the living beings on it were not made of flesh and blood, but were made of metal.</p><p>The desolate beasts above were the same!</p><p>And the Beast cores that were condensed in the bodies of these desolate beasts became a very precious material for refining weapons.</p><p>The higher the grade and cultivation of the desolate beast, the more precious and expensive the beast core condensed by it was.</p><p>&Nbsp; this attracted many experts to come and kill desolate beasts to obtain their beast cores.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The interplanetary warship entered the atmosphere of the myriad Gold Star and rubbed against the atmosphere, making loud rumbling sounds.</p><p>At this moment, the four of them exited the interplanetary warship and stood high in the sky.</p><p>The starry sky battleship quickly shrank and was put away by Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>“Let’s go down!”</p><p>It was not Tong Xi ‘er’s first time here, so she was the first to fly down.</p><p>Below him was a boundless forest.</p><p>“As expected, they are all made of metal…</p><p>As they neared the forest, Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>The trees and vegetation here were all made of strange metals.</p><p>Lu Ming saw iron trees, silver flowers and golden fruits.</p><p>Of course, these ordinary metals were of no use to them, so they didn’t care.</p><p>“The world is full of wonders!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The greater world in the primeval universe was indeed more wonderful than the lesser world.</p><p>An entire planet was made of all kinds of metals. The plants and living beings were all made of metal. If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe.</p><p>Legend had it that in the vast universe, there were many more wonderful plancts, some of which were beyond imagination.</p><p>As they neared the forest, Tong Xi ‘er’s speed decreased.</p><p>we have to be careful on the myriad Gold Star. Not only are the wild beasts dangerous, but the experts from other forces are even more dangerous!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘cr said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He understood that many forces would come here to hunt dire beasts. There were probably many powerful people on this myriad Gold Star. It was normal for these powerful people from different. forces to hunt people from other forces for their beast cores.</p><p>The four of them landed in the forest, concealed their auras, and slowly ran forward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a roar came from the front, and then a silver light flashed. They saw a huge figure rushing towards</p><p>them.</p><p>“Retreal!”</p><p>The four of them quickly retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth rumbled and the metal on the ground exploded and splattered. A huge creature appeared at the spot where Lu Ming and the rest had been standing.</p><p>It was a giant ape, more than thirty meters tall. Its body was silver-white as if it was cast from silver. Even the hair on its skin was like silver needles.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant silver ape roared angrily. Its silver eyes emitted a cold glint as it charged toward Lu Ming and the others. Its huge fist, which was the size of a small house, smashed toward Lu Ming and the others, bringing</p><p>with it a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“I’ll fight him!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over, circulated the ruler’s power, and threw a punch.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A dull boom was heard. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him and he could not help but retreat. However, the giant ape also took a few steps back, causing the ground to crack. what terrifying power! What a hard fist!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>£3</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
