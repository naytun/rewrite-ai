With only his head left, he retreated like crazy. He didn’t want to give up. He still wanted to resist, hoping that reinforcements could come.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took a step forward and blocked his way out.</p><p>Ao Gu revealed a despairing look.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed me, and you’ll die sooner or later. The ancestral Dragon is stubborn and has defied the will of the gods. On the day the sky is split open, divine punishment will descend, and you’ll all die!</p><p>Ao Gu roared, his face incomparably ferocious.</p><p>“Split open the sky! What is splitting open the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>hahaha, the ancestral Dragon has gone against the will of the gods and sealed</p><p>off the sky. He’s already on the path of no return…</p><p>Ao Gu laughed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“You’re pretty fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and the great desolation spear in his hand shot out rapidly.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This time, ao Gu couldn’t avoid it and his head was pierced through by the great desolation spear. His soul was also destroyed.</p><p>After killing ao Gu, Lu Ming put away the great desolation spear. In a flash, he flew back to the eternal cage. The restrictions of the eternal cage could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Ao Gu, he’s dead!”</p><p>At this moment, the people in the eternal cage were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Ao Gu was actually killed by Lu Ming. He was an unrivaled powerhouse.</p><p>As long as the war god didn’t appear, he would be invincible!</p><p>This was an unrivaled powerhouse. As long as the martial God did not appear, the unrivaled powerhouse would almost never die, unless he was besieged by multiple experts of the same level.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had killed an unrivaled powerhouse all by himself. It was like</p><p>a legend. It was too shocking to see this scene with their own eyes, hurry, there’s no time. Enter my small world and I’ll take you away! Lu Ming shouted and waved his hand. A light screen enveloped everyone. Then, with a flash, everyone was kept into the small world.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar sounded between heaven and earth.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The sky cracked open, and a figure appeared in the air, exuding an extremely powerful aura.</p><p>It was a non-human King.</p><p>After this non-human King appeared, another non-human King appeared in another direction.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>As soon as they arrived, they could sense that ao Gu had been killed.</p><p>This was a demigod that had survived since ancient times. Since ancient times, the evil god race had not given birth to many demigods. This was a huge loss.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to burn your bones and scatter your ashes!</p><p>A non-human King roared and launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>“I don’t have time to play with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming dashed in another direction and passed through the restriction. He was about to tear the space and escape.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space cracked open and a terrifying battle-ax was slashing toward Lu</p><p>Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and blocked the axe.</p><p>Then, a burly figure appeared. This was a noble of the evil god race. He was not a member of the royal family, but his aura was equally terrifying. He was also an unrivaled expert at the demigod level.</p><p>The evil god tribe was not a royal tribe, so they could cultivate to the demigod level.</p><p>Ordinary members of the evil god race and their aristocrats could also cultivate to the demigod level.</p><p>The royal family of the evil god tribe only had purer bloodlines, higher talents, and more powerful experts.</p><p>As for the ordinary members of the evil god race and the aristocrats of the evil god race, it was a little more difficult for them to cultivate to the demigod level. However, it was not impossible.</p><p>The three demigods surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>However, this was not the end. Behind Lu Ming, the space cracked open and another King of the alien race appeared.</p><p>The fourth one!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned solemn.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly moved and rushed toward the sky.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>The two kings of the non-human race joined forces and charged toward Lu</p><p>Ming, blocking his path.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were two consecutive terrifying explosions and Lu Ming was blocked.</p><p>There was a non-human king who was even stronger than the other Kings. This non-human King looked different from the other non-human Kings. He had long, fiery red hair and a pair of wings on his back that were suffused with fiery red flames.</p><p>His appearance was very similar to Kang duo, who was ranked second on the evil god tribe’s Longevity Roll.</p><p>Each of this person’s moves carried a terrifying flame that seemed to want to burn the heavenly Dao.</p><p>After Lu Ming was blocked, the other two demigods charged at him at the same time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear rapidly and defended his surroundings tightly. However, there was still a huge gap between him and the four invincible powerhouses.</p><p>The continuous attacks caused his long spear to stagnate. Then, an attack landed on his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was sent flying and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The four demigods of the evil god tribe charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>At this moment, there was only one word in Lu Ming’s heart, and that was to escape.</p><p>He understood that he was no match for four demigods. If he stayed to fight, he would die.</p><p>“The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming took out the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and attacked the two non-human Kings. He seized the opportunity to break through their defense and escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going to die today!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, the space cracked and two more figures appeared, launching an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Two more Kings.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming recognized the two of them. They had fought with each other before. They were the two foreign tribe Kings who were guarding the abysmal heavenly region.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Then, another non-human King appeared from another direction. He was coming from returning bamboo city.</p><p>There were a total of seven demigod-level beings.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>One attack after another was launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Faced with so many attacks, Lu Ming could not withstand them at all. He was sent flying, his body cracked and bleeding profusely. He almost burst open. He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll with all his might to recover from his injuries.</p><p>“I must escape, I will definitely escape!”</p><p>Even when facing the seven demigods, Lu Ming remained calm and raised his strength to the maximum.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In front of him, a sword and a long spear were charging toward Lu Ming. Above his head, a battle axe and an iron rod were blasted toward Lu Ming. There were attacks from the right, back, and left.</p><p>“Block it, block it, block it…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone brightly. His physical strength, the power of the path of domination, and the battle character formula were all used to the extreme.</p><p>The great desolation spear trembled and turned into a shocking spear radiance that attacked in all directions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Spear’s gleam was scattered. After all, it was not powerful enough. It was crushed by the demigods of the non-human race. Lu Ming was sent flying again. He was hit by a combat sword and his body was almost cut in half. However, his life force was still extremely vigorous. With the help of the indestructible ancient scroll, he was recovering rapidly.</p><p>it’s the indestructible ancient scroll. So it’s in your hands!</p><p>One of the non-human Kings said coldly. He recognized the indestructible ancient scroll.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
