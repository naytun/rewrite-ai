And yet, this Naga here recognized my Dao of sovereign with a single glance, and was so shocked. What’s the connection between all of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming shook his head. He could not figure it out and decided not to think about it anymore. Lu Ming continued to steer the boat and headed for the nearest Island.</p><p>At this moment, on the island that Lu Ming was going to, there was a humansnake hybrid who was shouting and laughing excitedly.</p><p>hahaha, the way of the Dominator, it’s actually the way of the Dominator! I thought that it would be a great fortune to have someone who had the hope of comprehending the way of the Dominator this time, but someone who has already comprehended the way of the Dominator has come!</p><p>“Hahaha, I didn’t expect this, I didn’t expect this. Could it be that the heavens didn’t want us to die? No, I have to tell the others about this!”</p><p>The human-snake hybrid was dancing with excitement. It was the humansnake hybrid who had attacked Lu Ming previously.</p><p>After mumbling to himself for a while, the serpent-man’s body began to glow. Then, another serpent-man appeared and rushed out. He plunged into the yellow spring sea and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, the projection of the serpent-man appeared on another island and met up with the other living beings.</p><p>“Why did you call us over in such a hurry?”</p><p>One was covered in flames and seemed to be made of magma.</p><p>big discovery, big discovery! The myriad tribulation has passed again. The living beings from the outside have come in again!</p><p>The Naga shouted.</p><p>“Nonsense, do you think we don’t know? Many people have already set off to take the test, and some have even landed on some islands!”</p><p>The magma-like creature said in disdain.</p><p>I’m not talking about that. Did you know that I just found a human from the foreign tribe who has mastered the way of domination? the way of domination! Hahaha!</p><p>The serpent-man laughed excitedly.</p><p>The entire scene fell silent. The other living beings stared at the serpent-man in shock, and their breathing began to become heavy.</p><p>“You… What did you just say? You say… Someone has mastered the Dao of a ruler?”</p><p>A humanoid creature with a pair of transparent wings opened its mouth and was tongue-tied, looking extremely excited.</p><p>yes, yes, it’s absolutely true! There’s no mistake!</p><p>The Naga nodded.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, great, great!”</p><p>“We have hope!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Following that, the few living beings began to laugh madly, as if they had gone mad.</p><p>no, I have to report this to the Lord. Wait for me. I’m going to report this to the Lord and let him make a decision!</p><p>The humanoid creature with the transparent wings said.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The others urged.</p><p>Then, the winged Humanoid creature soared into the sky and left, disappearing in the blink of an eye. The others waited patiently.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait too long before the human-shaped creature with transparent wings returned.</p><p>“Howis it? What did Daren say?”</p><p>The others quickly asked.</p><p>master said to adjust the assessment method for that person. The specific assessment method is like this…</p><p>The creature with the transparent wings explained the test method.</p><p>“It’s that difficult?”</p><p>The others stared at each other.</p><p>“His Excellency said that this is not difficult. If he can’t even pass this, then there is no hope for us. If he passes, then there is a chance to help us complete that task!”</p><p>The winged being said.</p><p>“What if he doesn’t pass?”</p><p>The others asked.</p><p>“Then kill them!”</p><p>The winged being’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“This …Alright!”</p><p>The others sighed and left one after another, starting to set up.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know that there were some difficulties waiting for him in front. He steered the small boat and kept moving forward. Finally, a few hours later, he arrived at the nearest Island.</p><p>The island wasn’t big, but it was lush and had some vegetation growing on it.</p><p>Lu Ming leaped onto the island.</p><p>When Lu Ming leaped onto the island, the small boat dissipated with a bang and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. It seemed that he could only move forward and not backward.</p><p>Without thinking much, Lu Ming walked toward the depths of the island.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming had not gone far when he suddenly heard a sharp sound behind him. A sharp light was aimed at Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>Without thinking, a purple-gold spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He swept it across and blocked the attack behind him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud boom and Lu Ming’s figure drifted backward slightly. At the same time, he saw a figure drifting backward.</p><p>“You again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. It was that human-snake hybrid again.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming could tell that the other party had come in person.</p><p>“Kid, that was just my projection!”</p><p>The serpent-man sneered.</p><p>“Who the hell are you? Also, how did you learn about my Dao of domination?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions in succession.</p><p>“If you want to know, you have to beat me first!”</p><p>The human-snake hybrid sneered. With a flick of his body, he charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear in the Naga’s hand was as fast as lightning, and its power was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength, his physical body and the Dao of domination. His long spear trembled as he attacked the serpent-man.</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in a flash, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“His strength is about the same as mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He realized that the Naga’s strength was almost the same as his.</p><p>It couldn’t be such a coincidence, unless the other party had intentionally suppressed his strength to the same level as him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the human-snake hybrid’s attack changed. The long spear turned into hundreds of phantoms and stabbed toward Lu Ming. It was hard to see the real and the fake.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. He was highly focused and his figure retreated continuously. All he could see were the illusionary images of the long Spears.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming moved. He only thrust his spear. This spear did not stab at any of the spear shadows but at a void.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When Lu Ming stabbed at the void, there was a loud boom. A long spear suddenly appeared in the void, while the other illusionary Spears disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Kid, your battle awareness is not bad. However, this is far from enough. Again!”</p><p>The Naga’s eyes brightened slightly, and then he launched another attack.</p><p>His figure flickered and he attacked Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed. This time, his attack was even stranger, trickier, and more unpredictable.</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>The other party’s strength was similar to Lu Ming’s, but his attack method was more mysterious than Lu Ming’s. He could often catch Lu Ming off guard.</p><p>“I’m going to lose just because we have the same strength? I won’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He became more and more focused and entered a mysterious mode. It was as if everything in the world was under his control.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced out continuously. Each spear was able to block the other party’s attack.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged more than a hundred moves with the other party. Lu Ming had already completely adapted to the other party’s attack method.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
