He headed straight for the eternal cage and arrived under the light screen.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and used The Way of the Master on the light screen.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s understanding and control of the way of domination were many times stronger than before. He broke through the light screen easily and rushed in.</p><p>However, at this moment, somewhere in the eternal cage, an old man with purple hair and a face full of wrinkles suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>someone actually managed to sneak into the eternal cage. He’s looking for death!</p><p>The old man growled, and the killing intent he exuded was extremely cold.</p><p>He was the expert who had replaced duo Lei to guard the eternal cage. Furthermore, he was even stronger than duo Lei. He wasn’t a peak heavenly Emperor, but an unrivaled expert at the demigod level.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>The elder’s aura was powerful as he waved his hands and controlled the nonhuman divine ancestor’s treasure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The treasure started to shake and gave off a bright light.</p><p>Beams of light, like divine swords, slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the entire eternal cage was alarmed.</p><p>“What’s going on? The great formation has been activated, and the murderous intent is so cold. What does ao Gu want to do?”</p><p>“Could it be that someone is trying to escape and has angered ao Gu?”</p><p>At this moment, all the living beings in the eternal cage were alarmed. They all came out of their secret chambers and looked at each other as they speculated.</p><p>Lu Ming was running at high speed in a passageway when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“It seems that I’ve been discovered!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He had thought that he would be able to fool the other party through the myriad World Cage, but it seemed like he had already been exposed.</p><p>Since he had been exposed, he might as well fight!</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Beams of light pierced through the mountain and the stone chamber, aiming at Lu Ming. The power was shocking.</p><p>This light came from the treasure of the divine ancestor. It was so powerful that it could kill a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was not at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>The great desolation spear appeared. With a shake, it shot out rays of spear radiance.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the radiance, creating a deafening boom. The terrifying force struck the surrounding stone chambers. Even though the stone chambers were engraved with arrays, they could not withstand the force and were blown apart.</p><p>“Let’s go, retreat to the center!”</p><p>Many figures rushed out of the secret chamber and headed for the center of the eternal cage.</p><p>“Eh? Demigod-level combat power!”</p><p>On the other side, the old man’s name was ao Gu. His eyes shone with a cold light as he took a step forward and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, he controlled the non-human divine ancestor’s treasure to form beams of light and attack Lu Ming.</p><p>the eternal cage ends here. I’ll destroy it today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His body burst into the air, and his long spear went against the flow. It destroyed a few rays of light in a row and swept out with the long spear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The entire mountain was disintegrating and exploding.</p><p>However, Lu Ming controlled his strength very well. He only attacked the mountain and did not hurt the living beings inside.</p><p>In the end, the entire mountain exploded. Under Lu Ming’s power, it turned into ashes and his line of sight widened.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw a large group of people gathered at the center of the eternal cage. There were more than a thousand people.</p><p>They were all living beings locked up in the eternal cage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>From all corners of the eternal cage, there were experts in blood-red armor who were charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Km!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He shook the great desolation spear and shot out beams of spear radiance at the alien races in blood-red armor.</p><p>Some of these alien races were at the great emperor realm and some were at the heavenly Emperor realm. However, they could not resist at all. They were pierced by Lu Ming’s spear radiance and died instantly.</p><p>“So strong, who is that?”</p><p>“It seems to be Lu Ming!”</p><p>“My God, it’s really Lu Ming. Didn’t he escape? Why did you come back?”</p><p>The people in the eternal cage recognized Lu Ming and were extremely shocked.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had escaped but he had returned now. Moreover, his combat strength was shockingly strong.</p><p>enter my small world and I’ll take you out!</p><p>Lu Ming said to those people.</p><p>“Leave?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>“Leave? Today, no one can leave!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard, and a terrifying aura spread toward Lu Ming. In the next moment, an old man with dry and wrinkled skin appeared.</p><p>It was ao Gu!</p><p>“We’re finished!”</p><p>Many people thought.</p><p>Ao Gu was an unrivaled powerhouse. Moreover, they were in the eternal cage. Ao Gu could control the treasure of the non-human race’s divine ancestor. Lu Ming was definitely dead!</p><p>Many people sighed. They did not understand why Lu Ming came back so stupidly after he had escaped. He looked as if he was going to fight ao Gu. Where did he get the courage?</p><p>It was not that they were hostile to Lu Ming. They just felt that Lu Ming’s actions were somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>“Soit’sahalf-God!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>No wonder he was discovered the moment he entered.</p><p>If there was only one peak heavenly Emperor in charge, it would be impossible for him to be discovered so quickly.</p><p>It seemed that after they escaped the last time, the foreign race had also raised their vigilance and sent a demigod to guard the eternal cage.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>die! ao Gu shouted coldly. He controlled the treasure of the non-human race’s divine ancestor. Beams of terrifying light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and his long spear was like a rainbow. It destroyed the rainbow lights and charged towards ao Gu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great desolation spear rapidly grew in size and shot towards ao Gu.</p><p>Ao Gu’s expression changed. An iron rod appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying tremor erupted. Then, everyone saw a figure constantly retreating.</p><p>ItwasaoGu!</p><p>Ao Gu retreated dozens of steps before he could stabilize himself. His face was pale as he looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He was not the only one. The others in the eternal cage were the same. They were all dumbfounded, thinking that they had seen wrong.</p><p>Not only had Lu Ming destroyed the attack launched by the divine ancestor’s treasure, but he had also forced ao Gu to retreat with a single strike. How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was too terrifying and shocking!</p><p>They knew very well that when Lu Ming first entered the eternal cage, he could barely fight against a one-star celestial Thearch.</p><p>However, only a few hundred years had passed, and Lu Ming could actually defeat an unrivaled powerhouse.</p><p>Such a speed of improvement was simply a miracle.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned red. Previously, they felt that it was unwise for Lu Ming to run away and come back now.</p><p>However, they understood now that it was not Lu Ming who was being unwise. They were ignorant.</p><p>Lu Ming was back. He was clearly confident!</p><p>Many people were excited. They hoped that Lu Ming could defeat ao Gu and bring them out.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Ao Gu was also shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to have such powerful combat strength.</p><p>“Damn it, go to hell!”</p><p>Ao Gu roared, using all the power of the divine ancestor’s treasure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
