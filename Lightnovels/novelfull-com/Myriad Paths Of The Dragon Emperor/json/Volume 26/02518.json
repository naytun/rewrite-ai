On those islands, figures were running toward the yellow Springs Island.</p><p>They were those who had not arrived at the yellow Springs Island and had stayed on other islands.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming saw Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the others…</p><p>His friends were all fine and their cultivation levels had all improved greatly. Lu Ming was relieved.</p><p>After a few hours, no one appeared on those islands.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! zu long led everyone and rushed to one side of the yellow spring Island. Following the coastline, they soon discovered two huge warships.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>One of the battleships roared and started to move, speeding forward.</p><p>The divine ancestor of the non-human race and some other experts of the evil god tribe were up there.</p><p>The evil god tribe had actually left first. One had to know that there were still some evil god tribe members on the island who had yet to board the ship. It was obvious that the non-human divine ancestor was afraid that the ancestral Dragon would fight him to the death, so he had abandoned some of the evil god tribe members and sailed the ship first.</p><p>“This guy is really despicable!”</p><p>Zu long said angrily.</p><p>He had really wanted to fight the non-human divine ancestor to the death, but the divine ancestor was avoiding him.</p><p>The remaining members of the evil god race sighed helplessly as they watched the non-human race’s divine ancestor and the others leave.</p><p>they had been abandoned, but luckily, the yellow Springs world was huge. Staying here was no different from staying in the evil god World.</p><p>When they saw the heaven realm powerhouse’s malicious gaze, their expressions changed, and they ran in another direction, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Zu long called for everyone to board the heaven-connecting battleship.</p><p>Soon, everyone boarded the warship. The warship began to move, braving the wind and waves, and sailed forward.</p><p>Not long after, a huge vortex appeared in front of them. The alien race and their sky-reaching battleships rushed into the vortex one after another.</p><p>This time, they didn’t throw everyone out like when they first came in. The two sky-reaching battleships followed the vortex and landed below.</p><p>Then, the water of the netherworld flowed forward, forming a large river.</p><p>Was this the source of the yellow spring River?</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but think so.</p><p>The yellow spring River started from here and then returned to the yellow spring world after one round, forming a cycle.</p><p>Therefore, as long as they followed the Yellow River, they would reach the battlefield outside the two world city of the taiqing heavenly region one day. However, it would probably take a long time.</p><p>The battlefield outside two world city was already relatively close to netherworld mountain. If they went around here, it would probably be very far. Everyone searched for a place to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest gathered together and chatted for a while before they went their separate ways.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the deck. With a single thought, the picture scroll and the word ‘battle’ appeared in his mind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attention was focused on the word ‘battle’.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming felt that there was an endless mysterious concept emerging.</p><p>It was an extremely mysterious feeling that could only be sensed but not described.</p><p>It was extremely mysterious and unfathomable. This was Lu Ming’s feeling about the word ‘battle’.</p><p>The ‘battle’ character that Lu Ming had comprehended in the third stage previously originated from here, but it was just a superficial understanding.</p><p>Lu Ming started to focus on his comprehension. The more he comprehended, the deeper he understood about ‘combat’.</p><p>The yellow spring River was really long. They had been traveling like this for two years.</p><p>At this moment, the non-human divine ancestor made his move. He forcefully tore open a space crack and charged into it with the sky-reaching battleship.</p><p>“That is… The nine nether heavenly domain!”</p><p>Many people saw it and recognized the world behind the spatial Rift.</p><p>It was obvious that the non-human divine ancestor and the others had entered the netherworld and planned to return from there.</p><p>Soon, the space closed.</p><p>They continued to move forward. Once they reached the nine nether heavenly domain, they would not be far from the Tai Qing heavenly domain.</p><p>Everyone stopped cultivating and started to wait.</p><p>As expected, not long after, the ancestral Dragon made his move. Under his attack, the space cracked open.</p><p>From the crack in space, one could see that they were facing the battlefield outside two world city.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon took the warship through the space crack and returned to the battlefield outside two world city.</p><p>He’s back!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>This time, he had been gone for more than a hundred years in netherworld mountain. He had experienced a lot. Now that he was back, he felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Everyone flew out of the sky-reaching battleship and headed for two world city.</p><p>Very quickly, they were approaching two world city.</p><p>Senior ancestral Dragon and the others are back!”</p><p>As they approached, the experts above two world city noticed them and quickly opened the array to let them in.</p><p>After entering, he found out that the heaven realm and the evil god tribe had not made any moves for the past hundred years. They had been in a stalemate.</p><p>Then, everyone took their leave.</p><p>This time, many of them had a fortuitous encounter in netherworld mountain.</p><p>Especially on the last island, the netherworld Island, many people had opportunities and needed to find a place to cultivate in seclusion and digest it.</p><p>The ancestral dragon left and returned to the lair of Zulong. He needed to use the fruit of life to recover from his injuries.</p><p>Time was of the essence, and the non-human divine ancestor would be able to recover as quickly as possible.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, dandan, Lu Xiangxiang, and the rest would stay in two world city for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’m leaving too. I’m a six-star heavenly Emperor now. I’m going to find a place to cultivate in seclusion and break through to the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. I’m going to recover to my previous peak!</p><p>Dandan bade farewell to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Dandan, this is for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a Jade box flew to dandan.</p><p>Dandan reached out and took it. When she opened it, there was an extremely strong medicinal fragrance coming out.</p><p>Dandan’s pupils contracted, revealing a fiery look, and she exclaimed, ” this is the fruit of life. Kid, how did you get the fruit of life? ”</p><p>He remembered that Lu Ming was not around when they were fighting for the life fruit.</p><p>“Shush, lower your voice!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at dandan. Fortunately, there were only the two of them here and no one else.</p><p>“Who am I? let me tell you, I have many fruits of life!”</p><p>Lu Ming said smugly.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Dandan was skeptical.</p><p>nonsense, of course it’s true. You can use this fruit of life to restore your cultivation to its peak!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The fruit of life was not only able to heal injuries, it also had the power to steal the heaven and earth’s fortune. In fact, even if an uninjured person consumed the fruit of life, its effects would still be extremely heaven-defying.</p><p>It could help people to strengthen their Foundation, develop their potential, improve their Foundation, and even break through their cultivation realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
