You’re really naïve. If I let you go now, wouldn’t I be courting death?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his eyes filled with killing intent. He swept his gaze over the people around him and said, “Move, let me leave, or I’ll kill him!”</p><p>“You dare? Kid, do you know who he is? He’s the young master of the yuanluo Palace, the son of the palace Master. If you dare to touch him, you’ll end up in a miserable state, do you understand?”</p><p>The elder roared, his eyes filled with cold killing intent. If not for his apprehension towards Kang long, he would have killed Lu Ming with a single blow.</p><p>the son of the palace Master of the yuanluo Palace? that’s even better. If I kill him, all of you will be buried with him. Come on, we’ll die together!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You… You…”</p><p>The old man and the two men were so angry that they almost vomited blood, but they didn’t dare to act. rashly.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. Kang long was the favorite of the ball Master of the yuanluo Hall. The hall Master was known for his ruthlessness. If Kang long died, they would be buried with him.</p><p>kid, you’re finished. I’m telling you, there’s no way for you to escape. I’m going to kill you and all the people in your small world. I won’t let anyone go. They’ll all die!</p><p>Kang long roared madly. The thought of being captured by a native from a small chiliocosm made him go crazy.</p><p>If this were to spread, wouldn’t he become laughing stock?</p><p>“Blowing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he swung his palm like a knife and one of Kang Long’s arms flew out. “Ah!”</p><p>Kang long screamed in pain.</p><p>At his level, he could quickly recover even if his body was torn apart. However, the pain was real.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The others also roared in anger.</p><p>you’re talking nonsense. Next time, I’ll directly destroy his divine flame. Now, all of you, get out of my way and let me leave. I’ll naturally let him go!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Let go of the young master and we’ll let you leave!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>do you think I’m stupid? I’ll let him go, and you’ll kill me immediately. Let me leave first. Otherwise, I’ll have to cripple him first!</p><p>Lu Ming said. His Dominator’s power transformed into a sharp sword and pierced into Kang Long’s dantian, trying to destroy his divine fire.</p><p>“Get out of the way, you idiots, get out of the way, let him go, let him go!”</p><p>Kang long shouted hysterically.</p><p>He was afraid. He was truly afraid. Once the divine flame was destroyed, his cultivation would be crippled. So what if he let Lu Ming go? in his heart, even if there were ten thousand or a hundred million Lu Mings,</p><p>they were not as important as a single hair on his head.</p><p>He swore that once he escaped, he would send experts to capture Lu Ming and grind his bones to dust.. The people at the side had ugly expressions, but now, they could only move aside.</p><p>The old man and the others retreated to the sides.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming carried Kang long and dashed past them, leaving the encirclement.</p><p>“Let go of the young master now!”</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>“When I’m safe, I’ll naturally let him go. Also, you’d better not chase after me, or I’ll immediately cripple him!” Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The old man and the rest were extremely furious. They wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces but they did not dare to pursue him. They could only watch helplessly.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at full speed and disappeared from their sight in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Quick, report this t the higher-ups and send experts at the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm and above. We must kill that brat and save young master!”</p><p>‘Hurry up!”</p><p>The old man and the others immediately took action and left the place.</p><p>Their cultivations were still insufficient. If there were powerhouses at seventh level void G.o.d Realm and above, even if Lu Ming took down Kang long, those people would be able to kill Lu Ming quickly and save Kang long before he could react.</p><p>The elder and the rest left the place one after another while Lu Ming carried Kang long and flew at top speed.</p><p>the s.p.a.ce of this primeval universe is too stable, and the gravity is shockingly strong!</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, he wanted to tear open the s.p.a.ce and travel through it. However, he realized that he could not do it.</p><p>In the heaven realm, with his cultivation, he could travel from One World to another in an instant with a single step.</p><p>But now, he realized that even if he used his full strength, he couldn’t tear open s.p.a.ce. Not to mention tearing s.p.a.ce, he couldn’t even create a ripple.</p><p>Moreover, the gravity here was extremely shocking. Lu Ming’s flying speed was a few hundred times slower than when he was in the heaven realm.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a deep breath and felt that the divine Qi in the world was surging toward him like a tide. Yes, it was divine Qi, not original Qi.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce here was filled with divine Qi, which was exactly the same as the one in netherworld mountain. However, the divine Qi in netherworld mountain could not be compared to this place at all. It was much thinner than here.</p><p>Although netherworld mountain was also sealed there from the primeval universe, it was normal for its divine Qi to be thin after such a long time.</p><p>the cultivation environment here is too good. If I cultivate here, my cultivation speed will be at least ten times faster than in the heaven realm. In some good places, it might even be faster!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>No wonder Kang long had attained the cultivation of a demiG.o.d in less than 500 years of cultivation.</p><p>The cultivation conditions here were completely incomparable to those in the heaven realm.</p><p>The great chiliocosm in the primeval universe was also known as the divine realm. The end point of all the small chiliocosm was not just a saying.</p><p>“Brat, you’re here, let me go!”</p><p>Kang long shouted again.</p><p>“Shut up and let you go. As far as I know, the entire underworld star is the territory of the yuan Luo Palace. When I’m safe, I’ll naturally let you go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You…</p><p>Kang long was furious, but he could only hold it in under the circ.u.mstances.</p><p>Lu Ming kept flying, looking for an isolated place to fly. After half a day, he had no idea how far he had flown.</p><p>Ile flew to a barren mountain and there was no one around.</p><p>Lu Ming stuffed Kang long into the mountain and river diagram and continued flying forward.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day had pa.s.sed. Lu Ming flew into a desolate mountain range.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>All of a sudden, an explosive roar came from below. The roar shook the sky and the mountains trembled. Then, a b.l.o.o.d.y mouth rushed out from below and bit at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He burst out with all his strength and used The Way of the Master to stomp down.</p><p>The ruler’s power condensed into a huge purple-gold foot, which stepped on the mouth. With a loud bang, the purple-gold foot collapsed, and Lu Ming was sent flying by a powerful force.</p><p>what shocking power! It’s equivalent to a second level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. What’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He used this force to fly at high speed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The earth rumbled as Lu Ming saw a huge creature as large as a mountain. It trod on the ground and chased alter Lu Ming.</p><p>$2</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
