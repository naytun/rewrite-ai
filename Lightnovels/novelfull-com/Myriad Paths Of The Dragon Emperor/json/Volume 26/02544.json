He was a demiG.o.d and was the strongest existence in the true dragon Tribe, second only to the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>He was even stronger than the nine Dragons back then!</p><p>In the divine beast clan, the top ten Battle Beasts were not the strongest. Some were comparable to the top ten Battle Beasts, or even surpa.s.sed them.</p><p>For example, the Golden sacred Dragon King, heavenly Tiger Thearch, and so on.</p><p>The reason why the top ten beasts were so famous was because they were special.</p><p>The top ten Battle Beasts were almost all mutated. For example, there were Nine Dragons and nine-headed Golden Lions. In the world, there was only one of them. Each of them had amazing talent, which was why they were so famous.</p><p>“You killed so many of my Dragon tribe’s tribesmen. I’ll tear you to pieces! The Golden Holy Dragon King’s eyes were cold.</p><p>The Golden Holy Dragon King roared and pounced towards the non-human King, engaging in an intense battle.</p><p>“Golden Holy Dragon King, how many of us can you stop by yourself?”</p><p>A cold voice sounded. Not far away, the s.p.a.ce trembled and another non-human King appeared. His powerful aura pressed down on the Golden Holy Dragon King,</p><p>“Oh, really? Do you think there’s no one else in the heaven realm?”</p><p>A sharp voice rang out.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce cracked open, and a huge Phoenix covered in red flames flew out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, a Giant Tiger the size of a mountain appeared on the other side. It was filled with and its aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>old Phoenix King, heavenly tiger emperor, you old guys are all here!</p><p>A cold smile appeared on the non-human King’s face.</p><p>good. They didn’t die in the ancient battle. This time, they’re dead!</p><p>A cold voice rang out. Next to the non-human King, many figures appeared.</p><p>fiendish aura</p><p>There were a total of eight figures. Including the one who was fighting the Golden Holy Dragon King, there were a total of nine people. Each of them was wearing a crown and had an earth-shattering aura.</p><p>With the nine non-human Kings gathered, no one dared to approach within a radius of a few million miles, except for Supreme Emperor sky Tiger and the old Phoenix King.</p><p>Those who were fighting and killing consciously stayed away from this area.</p><p>These were all unrivaled experts. Once they made a move, the world would be turned upside down. Those who got close and were swept in would be crushed to pieces.</p><p>I didn’t expect all nine of you to be here!”</p><p>Heavenly tiger Emperor’s expression was extremely serious.</p><p>what? there are only three of you in the heaven realm? I’ll finish you off today!</p><p>One of the non-human Kings was the most anxious and immediately charged towards the old Phoenix King. Following that, the other non-human King also made his move and fought with the sky Tiger Supreme</p><p>Emperor.</p><p>However, there were still six other Kings present.</p><p>hehe, it seems that those guys from the heaven realm haven’t come yet. Then I’ll take care of these three bcasts first and bring them back to drink with me!</p><p>A tall non-human King, with his purple hair flying in the wind, charged out and attacked heavenly Tiger Imperial master with a terrifying move.</p><p>He wanted to team up with the other non-human King to deal with sky tiger emperor first.</p><p>However, at this moment, a spear pierced through the air toward this non-human King.</p><p>The non-human King’s expression changed, and he could only change his move to block the spear. BOOM!</p><p>The void exploded and the long spear trembled. A burly man in battle armor stepped out of the dark void, his aura violent.</p><p>five elements, your cultivation…</p><p>The non-human King was shocked.</p><p>The burly man in armor was the five elements Qilin, one of the top ten Battle Beasts. Back then, he had only had the cultivation base of a peak heavenly Emperor. However, he was now a demiG.o.d.</p><p>“Are you surprised? I’ll slaughter you today!”</p><p>The five elements Qilin was extremely domineering.</p><p>slaughter me? hahaha, so what if you’re here? you’ll still die!</p><p>The non-human King laughed.</p><p>“Count me in!”</p><p>With a roar, a huge Golden Lion charged from the distance. Its nine heads let out a long bowl, and its aura was terrifying. It was also a demiG.o.d.</p><p>haha, qingcang, it seems like you’ve also broken through!</p><p>With a loud laugh, a giant bull appeared, its aura violent.</p><p>A middle-aged man was standing beside the giant bull. It was the nine lives devilish silkworm.</p><p>Their auras had all reached the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>“How is that possible? How come all of you have reached the demiG.o.d realm?”</p><p>‘d.a.m.n it!’</p><p>A few non-human Kings cried out in disbelief.</p><p>First, it was the five elements Qilin, then the nine-headed Golden Lion, followed by the t.i.tan Longhorn and</p><p>the nine lives devilish silkworm. All of them were demiG.o.ds.</p><p>They were all peak heavenly emperors in the past.</p><p>Although a peak heavenly Emperor was only a step away from becoming a demiG.o.d,</p><p>t was extremely difficult</p><p>to cross this step. DemiG.o.ds also had the word ‘G.o.d’ in their names. With a wisp of divine fire, they had stepped into a completely different level, a higher level of life. The meaning behind it was completely different.</p><p>There were many peak heavenly emperors in the world, but the number of demiG.o.ds was extremely small. If it had only been a single breakthrough, it would still have made sense. However, the five elements Qilin, Qing Cang, the t.i.tan Longhorn, and the nine-lives devilish silkworm had all broken through. This was shocking</p><p>No wonder the Kings were so shocked.</p><p>weren’t you very powerful in the past because of your high cultivation? let’s fight, now!</p><p>kill! Qing Cang roared as his nine lion heads charged toward a non-human King,</p><p>At the same time, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm also attacked a non-human</p><p>King</p><p>Of the nine non-human Kings, seven of them had opponents.</p><p>There were only two left.</p><p>‘Let’s attack first and kill them together!”</p><p>The eyes of the remaining two non-human Kings glowed with a cold light. They were about to join forces to kill the nine lives devilish silkworm and the others.</p><p>At this moment, the void in the distance exploded. A huge mountain suddenly rushed out of the void. It was extremely huge and pressed down on one of the giant beard race beings.</p><p>Although the giant beard tribe was extremely powerful, they still couldn’t resist the mountain and were blasted into meat paste.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a combat sword appeared above the head of another giant beard tribe cultivator and cut him in</p><p>half.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two powerful giant beard tribe members had been killed.</p><p>“Who’s there? Sneak attack from there!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two kings were furious.</p><p>The giant beard race was a powerful weapon of war. Each of them was extremely powerful, but they were few in number. Now that two of them had been killed, the non-human King’s heart bled.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them attacked at the same time. They stretched out two big hands and blasted in the direction of the two weapons. The void there was directly shattered,</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two weapons trembled and disappeared. In the next moment, a battle saber appeared above the head of another giant beard tribe member. With a slash, it killed the other giant beard tribe member.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two kings of the non-human race were furious. They rushed out and attacked together. The area was completely destroyed, and the s.p.a.ce was blown into pieces.</p><p>“Aiya, you scared this Lord to death!”</p><p>In the dark void, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth wearing a Daoist robe was shouting and jumping</p><p>around, dodging the attacks of the non-human Kings.</p><p>If it wasn’t dandan, who else could it be?</p><p>22</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
