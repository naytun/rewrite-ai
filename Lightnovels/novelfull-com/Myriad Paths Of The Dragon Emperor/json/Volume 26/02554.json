Other than the martial G.o.d. they feared no one.</p><p>However, they were defeated by Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun in just a few moves.</p><p>don’t panic. Gather and set up the formation!</p><p>The commander of the sky-breaking Army roared. He was a hall-G.o.d, and he wanted to gather the sky-breaking Army again to form a formation to fight against Xic nianqing and the others.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, five Black Lotus flowers appeared around him.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Lotus spun, and its petals turned into sharp sword Qi, flying toward him.</p><p>The sky breaking Army’s commander’s expression changed as he swung his axe to block.</p><p>After a series of clashing sounds, the heaven crushing Army’s commander’s body trembled violently. The heaven Dao soldier’s battleaxe in his hand was chipped, and his chest had been pierced through by a sword Qi.</p><p>He was severely injured and spat out a large mouthful of blood. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>How could he be so strong? he was extremely frightened.</p><p>After all, he was a demiG.o.d and was known as an unrivaled master. However, he was severely injured after exchanging a single blow with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Buzzcent!</p><p>The next moment., Xie nianging appeared beside him.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The heaven crushing Army’s commander was shocked and quickly retreated, but it was too late. A sword light flashed, and his head flew high into the air.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, he had no way of fighting back against Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were cold and merciless. With a wave of his hand, endless sword Qi rushed towards the heaven breaking Army.</p><p>The sky-breaking Army originally had 100000 overlords, 5000 heavenly emperors, and 95000 great emperors. However, they were now vulnerable to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Wherever the sword Qi pa.s.sed, the sky breaking Army’s experts were pierced through and killed.</p><p>No matter if it was a heavenly Emperor or a great emperor, it was the same. Even a peak heavenly Emperor couldn’t block Xie nianqing’s attack.</p><p>At the same time, Xic nianjun also made his move. His attack style was very similar to Xic nianqing’s. Wherever the milky white sword light pa.s.sed, a large number of sky breaking Army Masters were killed.</p><p>It was a one-sided ma.s.sacre, like harvesting wheat. The experts of the sky breaking Army were all killed. “No… d.a.m.n it. No…</p><p>The number one king of the non-human race, the older Kings, felt their hearts bleed.</p><p>The heaven crushing Army was the strongest army of the evil G.o.d race! So many powerful beings had died just like that!</p><p>At the same time, they were extremely frightened.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were simply unstoppable. After they finished killing the sky breaking Army, wouldn’t it be their turn?</p><p>They had seen how the demiG.o.d had been killed by Xie nianqing in seconds.</p><p>If it were them, it wouldn’t be much different.</p><p>“Divine ancestor, what should we do?”</p><p>The number one king roared, and his voice traveled through the dark void toward the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>retreat! Form a large formation and defend with all your might!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor scnt.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor was also furious. He had never expected the battle to turn out like this. Before the battle, he was full of confidence.</p><p>On the surface, the evil G.o.d tribe’s side had the upper hand, be it the low-end, mid-level, or high-end combat forces.</p><p>Moreover, the martial G.o.d Realm had him and the sacred ancestor bloodheart. As long as they made a move, the scene would definitely be one sided. They would definitely be able to flatten the heaven realm.</p><p>However, after the battle, everything was beyond his expectations.</p><p>In the beginning, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the divine turtle of the world had appeared one after another. They had all broken through to the demiG.o.d realm and held back a portion of their strength.</p><p>After that, venerable sovereign rebellion and the others actually recovered from their injuries.</p><p>What was even more unexpected was that Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun seemed to have appeared out of thin air and held Saint ancestor bloodheart back until Lu Ming broke through.</p><p>“La Ming, it’s all Lu Ming ….</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared in his heart.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming, He had taken out a large number of life fruits, the t.i.tan Longhorn, the nine-lives devilish silkworm, and the others to break through.</p><p>Venerable sovereign rebellion and the others had only recovered because of Lu Ming’s fruit of life.</p><p>In fact, Xie nianqing was Lu Ming’s wife!</p><p>Lu Ming was the reason why the situation had developed to this point.</p><p>Now, they could only defend and hold their ground. They would only have a chance to turn the tables when Saint patriarch murderheart killed Lu Ming or the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>At the thought of this, he could not help but look at the place where Lu Ming and the sacred ancestor bloodheart were fighting. His pupils constricted at first glance.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had completely gained the upper hand and suppressed Saint ancestor bloodheart. Lu Ming and the sacred ancestor bloodheart. had already exchanged hundreds of moves in the dark void.</p><p>Lu Ming did not activate the “battle” formula to double his combat strength. He was only fighting with Saint. patriarch murderheart in his normal state.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s courage mounted as the battle progressed. Previously, he had just broken through and was not very familiar with the use of his strength. However, after the battle, he was able to use the sudden surge in strength with ease.</p><p>In addition, the battle symbol art was truly wondrous. When used, no matter what attack it was, it would greatly increase one’s combat power. In addition, Saint ancestor bloodheart burned his divine power. The longer the battle went on, the weaker he would be. Thus, Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The great desolation spear in Lu Ming’s hand danced like a real Dragon, and spearlight shot toward Saint ancestor bloodheart. Saint ancestor bloodheart retreated continuously, and it was getting more and more difficult for him to resist.</p><p>PM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear had pierced through Saint ancestor bloodheart’s body, but he was trying his best to recover. The wound was wriggling with blood light, trying to heal.</p><p>However, at this moment, his expression suddenly changed. Then, the aura on his body rapidly weakened.</p><p>He had not recovered from his injuries and had not returned to his peak condition. He had burned his Shen power to reach his peak condition, which was difficult to maintain for a long time.</p><p>Now, his divine power was almost exhausted, and his condition was rapidly declining.</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss this opportunity? his eyes turned cold and he struck down with the great desolation</p><p>spcar,</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sacred ancestor Sacred Heart was sent flying. His body was almost cut in half. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and his aura became even more dispirited.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and caught up with sacred ancestor bloodheart. The great desolation spear shook and was covered with the brilliant power of the Dominator. It charged toward sacred ancestor bloodheart, intending to destroy him completely.</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart retreated frantically, but he still couldn’t Dodge Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>His body was smashed into pieces, turning into a sea of blood.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his palms. The purple-gold Dominator’s power transformed into two huge palms. They closed and enveloped the blood sea in the center of the palms.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to use the power of a ruler to completely refine the Holy ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>“No, no, Moke, come and save me!”</p><p>no! sacred ancestor bloodheart shouted in horror. He tried to break out of the ruler Power’s encirclement,</p><p>but he couldn’t.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared. His golden hair flew in the wind as he used all his strength to exchange a few blows with the ancestral Dragon. He seized the opportunity and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
