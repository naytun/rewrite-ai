The small worlds of all the people who cultivated the nomological laws system in the heaven realm and the primordial realm had fused with the gra.s.sland.</p><p>The area of this gra.s.sland had also expanded a little, and the distance between some big cities had become further.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, several auras soared into the sky. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>“That is … Break through to the war G.o.d level!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered and he looked in the direction of the aura.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder Emperor, Renegade Emperor…</p><p>There were a total of five people, and their auras were getting stronger and stronger, reaching their peak. This was a sign of a breakthrough to the martial G.o.d Realm. Lu Ming did not expect that the heavenly Thunder Emperor and the others would also make a breakthrough at this time.</p><p>However, it was normal when he thought about it. Venerable Lord sky Thunder, venerable Lord rebellion, and the others had long become demiG.o.ds. With their acc.u.mulation over a long period of time, they could have broken through to the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, in the heaven realm, the conditions were limited, so it was difficult to succeed.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu…</p><p>The bodies of the five venerable sovereigns were like five vortexes, constantly absorbing the energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>The divine Qi in the world surged and gathered towards them.</p><p>After a few days, their auras rose sharply. A layer of light covered the surface of their bodies like a flame. It was a burning divine fire.</p><p>They had broken through to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>“There’s no Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, feeling a little surprised.</p><p>He had discovered this situation a long time ago. During this period of time, too many people and divine beasts in the heaven realm and the primordial realm had broken through, but none of them had a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the primordial realm, breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm, martial Saint realm, and Martial Emperor realm would all be accompanied by disasters. But here, there was nothing.</p><p>In the heaven realm, there was also a terrifying Heavenly Tribulation when one broke through to the demiG.o.d realm. Lu Ming had thought that there would be a Heavenly Tribulation when one broke through to the martial G.o.d Realm. He did not expect that there was none.</p><p>perhaps this is the difference between the heaven realm and the primordial realm and the primeval universe!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>In the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm, the heavenly Dao was Supreme. All heavenly tribulations were evolved from the heavenly Dao.</p><p>However, that heavenly Dao was only the heavenly Dao of the heaven realm and the primordial realm. It had nothing to do with the primeval universe.</p><p>Perhaps, there was no such thing as a Heavenly Tribulation in the primeval universe.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This was good too. His parents ‘cultivation had been improving. It was only a matter of time</p><p>before they broke through to the Martial Emperor realm. Without the heavenly Tribulation, Lu Ming would be</p><p>more at case.</p><p>“Congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>Many people flew over to congratulate venerable Lord Heavenly Thunder, venerable Lord rebellion, and the others for successfully breaking through to the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder Emperor and the others were all smiling, unable to hide the excitement in their hearts. They had been trapped in the same realm for too long. In the past, it had been difficult for them to break through. Now that they had broken through, they suddenly felt like birds flying in the sky, and their hearts had opened up.</p><p>Lu Ming also came forward to congratulate him. After a lively atmosphere, Lu Ming returned to his residence. Lu Ming was currently living in a newly built city. Ile, Xie nianqing, Lu shenhuang, Lu Chi, his few disciples, and his parents all lived in this city.</p><p>Lu Ming entered a room and sat cross-legged.</p><p>A piece of crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>This crystal was the size of a fist, and it was crystal clear.</p><p>These crystals were called divine crystals, and they were made of pure divine Qi.</p><p>In netherworld mountain, the divine stone that Lu Ming obtained was also condensed from divine Qi. However, that kind of divine stone could be said to be inferior to divine crystals. The divine Qi contained in it. could not be compared to divine crystals at all.</p><p>Perhaps, tens f thousands of divine stones were only equivalent to one divine crystal.</p><p>After all, netherworld mountain had been sealed in the heaven realm and the primordial realm. After a long time, its divine Qi was no longer pure. The divine stones that it had condensed naturally could not compare to divine crystals.</p><p>Divine crystals were the hard currency of the divine realm. They were divided into low grade, middle grade, high grade, and top grade.</p><p>The divine crystals in Lu Ming’s hands were low-grade divine crystals. One of them was equivalent to tens of thousands of divine stones. As for divine crystals of mid-grade and above, they were naturally even rarer and more precious.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed seven to eight void G.o.d Realm experts when he invaded the heaven realm. On the underworld star, he had also killed a few yuanluo Palace experts. He had obtained some low-grade divine crystals from their storage rings. In total, there were more than five thousand pieces.</p><p>Five thousand low-grade divine crystals would be more than one hundred million divine stones if they were exchanged for divine stones.</p><p>As for exchanging it for Supreme-grade raw gemstones, it was an even more astronomical figure. Orirocks were born from the heaven realm and the primordial realm. They were worlds apart from divine crystals, so they naturally couldn’t be compared.</p><p>Lu Ming tidied up the items in his hands and continued to cultivate.</p><p>Time flew by, and soon, another year had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Over the past year, more people had broken through. The overall strength of the people from the heaven realm and the primordial realm had been increasing.</p><p>Moreover, many demiG.o.ds had successfully broken through and entered the martial G.o.d Realm. Almost all of the older demiG.o.ds had entered the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Even dandan, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others were almost there! “Lu Ming, I’m going to break through!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’s about to break through? Alright, I’ll protect you!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xic nianqing nodded. The two of them left the city and came to an empty land.</p><p>“Eh? Thank you, nianjun!”</p><p>In front of him, a figure sat cross-legged in the air, shining with brilliant holy light.</p><p>He didn’t expect to meet Xie nianjun here.</p><p>“You’re going to break through too?”</p><p>Xie nianjun looked at Xie nianqing in surprise.</p><p>“Not bad!” Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>I didn’t expect that your cultivation speed would be so fast even after you’ve devoured the memories of your</p><p>previous life. I’m a little jealous, hehehe!</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“If I don’t cultivate faster, I’ll be surpa.s.sed by you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing also smiled faintly. Then, he went to the other side and sat cross-legged in the void. Ilis body</p><p>was surrounded by a black light.</p><p>Xie nianjun didn’t say much. He closed his eyes and adjusted his state of mind.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three days later, almost at the same time, a shocking aura burst out from the two of them.</p><p>A black light beam and a white light beam shot up into the sky and broke through the clouds.</p><p>At this moment, countless people looked over.</p><p>what a shocking aura! Someone has broken through to the martial G.o.d Realm!</p><p>In a city, zu Long’s eyes flickered. Then, he soared into the sky and appeared not far from Lu Ming not long</p><p>after.</p><p>Then, the heavenly Thunder Emperor and the others also appeared one by one and watched from afar.</p><p>At this moment, Xic nianging and Xic nianjun’s auras were getting stronger and stronger, as if they would</p><p>never stop.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Heaven and earth rumbled, and their bodies were like two black holes. Endless divine Qi between heaven and</p><p>carth gathered toward them and poured into their bodies.</p><p>Their auras rose once more, and a terrifying pressure spread out.</p><p>“This aura… How can it be so shocking?”</p><p>it’s so terrifying. It’s more than ten times more terrifying than when we broke through. How could it be?” The ancestral Dragon, venerable sovereign rebellion, venerable sovereign sky Thunder, and the others couldn’t stay calm anymore. They all exclaimed in shock.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
