In the vast Hunyuan heavenly region, there were not many evil god tribe members. Previously, the evil god tribe had been defeated like a landslide, and most of them had withdrawn from the Hunyuan heavenly region.</p><p>hahaha, I’m finally back in the Hunyuan heavenly realm. How many years has it been? hahaha!</p><p>Some people laughed crazily.</p><p>The person who laughed was a heavenly Emperor. He was from the Hunyuan heavenly realm in the ancient times. However, he had never returned to the Hunyuan heavenly realm ever since it was occupied by the alien races.</p><p>Now that he had returned, he was naturally excited!</p><p>let’s go. Lu Ming must have gone to the passageway between the chaotic Yuan heavenly realm and the ten thousand spirit heavenly realm. Let’s go and help him!</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The spirits of the heaven realm beings were high as they charged towards the passageway between the heaven realm and ten thousand spirit realm.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had indeed reached the passageway between the chaotic Yuan heavenly realm and the ten thousand spirit heavenly realm.</p><p>There were indeed many members of the evil god tribe gathered in this passageway. However, when Lu Ming arrived, they were still no match for him. They were defeated and retreated to the next heaven domain, the nine nether heaven domain.</p><p>Through the passage, Lu Ming arrived at the ten thousand spirit realm.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little emotional. Back then, he came to the ten thousand spirit realm by accident and met Ren Chan and the others. He also got to know the immemorial body cultivators and obtained the cultivation method of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue the evil god tribe immediately. Instead, he took a step forward and headed toward the most forbidden area in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain, the land of dusk.</p><p>Back then, the Archean body cultivators lived in the depths of the land of dusk, and the small world of Ren Chan and the others was also at the edge of the land of dusk.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the land of dusk, the small world where Ren Chan used to live.</p><p>The small world had completely collapsed and turned into nothingness.</p><p>Needless to say, the remaining people in the small world of Ren Chan and the others were probably dead.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming went to the depths of the land of dusk. This hell had also been blown up. It was in tatters and empty.</p><p>This made the viciousness in Lu Ming’s eyes intensify.</p><p>evil god tribe, it’s best if some stronger experts come!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. An opponent at the peak of the heavenly Emperor level was not challenging to him at all. It could not be used to hone his skills.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure had already disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the passageway between the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain and the abysmal heavenly domain.</p><p>There weren’t many obstructions here, and there was almost no evil god tribe. Clearly, the evil god tribe had already retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the netherworld realm and headed toward the passageway there.</p><p>The passageway of the netherworld realm was connected to the beast God Realm.</p><p>In this passageway, Lu Ming finally saw the densely packed evil god tribe.</p><p>Countless members of the evil god race had set up formations and defensive systems here. The entire passageway was covered in a pitch-black light barrier. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He shook the great desolation spear and whipped it down.</p><p>The great desolation spear expanded rapidly, reaching a length of a million miles as it lashed out at the evil god tribe’s formation.</p><p>But this time around, before the great desolation spear could land, an axe radiance slashed out from the evil god tribe’s Army.</p><p>This axe light was also extremely terrifying and split the entire sky in half.</p><p>In the eyes of ordinary people, this was completely like the creation of the world!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great desolation spear and the axe radiance collided with each other. The void within a radius of millions of miles exploded and turned into nothingness.</p><p>Following that, a terrifying aura burst forth from the evil god tribe’s Army. A figure stepped out into the air and arrived high up in the sky.</p><p>This figure had purple hair and was not much different from a human. His three eyes were opened and revealed a cold luster.</p><p>On his head, he was wearing a crown.</p><p>“A King of a non-human race?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. It seemed that demigodlevel existences from the evil god tribe had finally arrived.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Kings of the ten Royal clans of the non-human race were all existences that surpassed peak heavenly emperors. They were all unrivaled figures at the demigod level.</p><p>The non-human King’s aura was terrifying and overbearing. He was much stronger than a peak-stage heavenly Emperor.</p><p>It was obvious that the outsiders had already sent the news back, so a King of the outsiders had come.</p><p>Lu Ming, you killed three peak heavenly emperors of my clan. You must die today!”</p><p>The non-human King said coldly, his killing intent extremely thick.</p><p>Cut the crap. If you want to kill me, let’s see if you have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The great desolation spear buzzed and vibrated. Lu Ming’s</p><p>eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>This was the first time he was facing a demigod.</p><p>How strong were demigods?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The king of the non-human race carried a pitch-black battleaxe. He took a step forward and appeared not far from Lu Ming. He swung the battleaxe down.</p><p>The non-human King’s attack was extremely simple. There was nothing fancy about it. However, the power of the axe was extremely terrifying. It could break everything.</p><p>It was really able to break through everything. It was as if nothing in this world could stop it. Even the heavenly Dao was about to be torn apart.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger. The qi and blood in his body churned, and the power of the world burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed all his strength to the limit and waved his long spear, blasting it out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them clashed again, and the sky exploded with a terrifying boom.</p><p>Everything within a million miles seemed to be destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two figures retreated ten thousand miles and stood in the void, facing each other.</p><p>This time, it was a draw!</p><p>is this the divine power condensed after 10000 elements return to one? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in a low voice. He was looking forward to it.</p><p>He had heard from the ancestral Dragon that demigods could combine everything into one and form a divine fire in their bodies.</p><p>This divine fire was made of divine power.</p><p>However, in the heaven realm, the evil god Realm, this was already the limit.</p><p>Only by leaving this place and going outside would one be able to become a war god.</p><p>There was a huge difference between a demigod and a martial God.</p><p>A demigod could only form a single divine flame, and the divine power contained in a single divine flame was extremely limited.</p><p>The martial God, on the other hand, was filled with divine power. He was many times more powerful than he was before.</p><p>However, the power of divine power was beyond the heavenly path. It was too shocking. Even the divine power contained in a divine fire was enough to be invincible.</p><p>Without the martial God, who could compete with him? he was known as an invincible powerhouse.</p><p>At this moment, countless members of the evil god race were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight against a King. Lu Ming’s strength was too terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block. Kill!”</p><p>The king of the non-human race wielded his battle axe and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>His body and the battleaxe were both covered in a thin layer of divine power, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and charged over.</p><p>This was the feeling he wanted. The king of the outsiders could finally give him some pressure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
