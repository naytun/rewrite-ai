This had continued for sixty years.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped inviting peak heavenly emperors after sixty years.</p><p>However, it was enough. Everyone in the entire heaven realm knew about Lu Ming’s connections. It was too shocking. The number of experts standing behind him was terrifying.</p><p>Although many people felt that Lu Ming was not very powerful, he was shocked by his energy.</p><p>Sixty years later, although there were no peak heavenly emperors giving Dao lectures, it seemed to have become a tradition. From time to time, powerful heavenly emperors would hold Dao lectures here, attracting many people to come and listen.</p><p>Some of these sergeants were four-star heavenly emperors, and some were five-star heavenly emperors. Although they were far inferior to peak heavenly emperors, it was still a rare opportunity for those living beings below the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>The Dragon sovereign peak had turned into a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>Time passed quickly. It had been a hundred years since Lu Ming and the rest left netherworld mountain.</p><p>In the past hundred years, other than accompanying his family or teaching his disciples, Lu Ming had spent the rest of his time cultivating.</p><p>His comprehension of the sovereign Dao had grown stronger and stronger over the past hundred years, but his cultivation was still at peak great emperor.</p><p>His comprehension of the ‘battle character formula’ was also getting deeper and deeper. It was several times better than when he had just come out of netherworld mountain.</p><p>As for the others, such as Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Long Chen, and Huang Ling, they had all improved greatly.</p><p>After consuming the fruit of life, their potential had exploded and their cultivation had increased greatly. Now, all of them had stepped into the great emperor realm.</p><p>Even Lu Ming’s two in-name disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou, had become martial emperors.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming and Li Ping were drinking tea and chatting in the courtyard.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, your and Xiaoqing’s granddaughter is already so old. Aren’t you going to settle your matters?”</p><p>Li Ping asked.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>His granddaughter, Lu Chi, had displayed shocking cultivation talent. She had become a great emperor long ago and had cultivated for more than 200 years.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Chi was focused on cultivation and had no intention of getting married, Lu Ming would have many descendants.</p><p>However, his wedding with Xie nianqing had never been held. Li Ping and Lu Yuntian were still thinking about it.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’re thinking about Qiu Yue, miss Feng Ling, and miss Mu Lan, aren’t you?”</p><p>Li Ping glanced at Lu Ming and said with a faint smile.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed dryly.</p><p>That was indeed the case. Now, his family and friends were all gathered in the vicinity of the Dragon Emperor Peak to cultivate.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Qiu Yue were both there.</p><p>Huang Ling and Mu Lan were there as well. Everyone could see their feelings for Lu Ming, let alone him.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not know how to face it. Hence, the wedding had been delayed.</p><p>this child, you are exactly the same as your father when he was young. You also like to play with flowers and grass …</p><p>Li Ping said in dissatisfaction.</p><p>cough, cough, cough. You’re a woman, don’t talk nonsense. When did I flirt around?”</p><p>At the side, Lu Yuntian hurriedly coughed dryly, and his face turned red.</p><p>“Father, mother, let me think about this matter again…”</p><p>Lu Ming was having a headache too. The only thing he could do now was to delay it and find an opportunity to test Xie nianqing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Right at this moment, a few explosions suddenly came from the distant sky.</p><p>Someone had barged in!</p><p>The first thing that came to Lu Ming’s mind was that someone had barged in and was attacked by the array.</p><p>“Who’s there? How dare you break into the dragon Emperor Peak!”</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t even need to make a move. Five to six figures immediately rushed out from the Dragon sovereign peak and flew into the sky to launch an attack.</p><p>They were Thunder one, Earth One, gold one, and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky above the Dragon sovereign peak, there was a black shadow that was moving extremely fast. It was fighting with Lei Yi and the others. However, after a few moves, Lei Yi and the others were completely outmatched and were forced to retreat.</p><p>“Let this old master deal with you!”</p><p>In the Dragon sovereign peak, an old man stepped out in the air. His fist force was as heavy as a mountain, and it blasted toward the black shadow.</p><p>This elder was an elder among the immemorial body cultivators. He was also the strongest one. Back then, his cultivation had already reached the four-star heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves, but the old Archean body cultivator was no match for him and was forced to retreat.</p><p>‘Hehehe, it’s said that Dragon Emperor Peak is full of powerhouses, but you’re just so-so.”</p><p>A sneer was heard, and a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a black-robed old man. He was thin and his eyes were cold.</p><p>“It’s the Black Bat King!”</p><p>“One of the three Kings of darkness, the Black Bat King!”</p><p>Voices were heard from the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>Lu Ming s close friends and family were not the only ones cultivating near the Dragon sovereign peak. There were many other people cultivating there as well. Some of them recognized the elder in black.</p><p>“So it’s the Three Kings of darkness!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had also heard of the Three Kings of darkness. They were the three notorious scums in the heaven realm.</p><p>As the saying goes, when the forest is big, there are all kinds of people.</p><p>There were countless living beings in the heaven realm, and not everyone was determined to fight against the evil god tribe.</p><p>Among them, there were some who never fought with the alien races and often attacked the heaven realm powerhouses. They were notorious.</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness were the best among them.</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness were not humans, but three divine beasts.</p><p>Two of them were five star heavenly emperors, while the other one was a six star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>In addition, they were extremely cautious and never provoked strong people with high cultivation. Moreover, they did not have a fixed residence and were elusive. They were also good at speed. Some of the top experts of the heaven realm wanted to get rid of them, but they always escaped.</p><p>The mention of the Three Kings of darkness caused many people in the heaven realm to change their expressions.</p><p>“Black bat King, you dare to come to my Dragon sovereign peak? aren’t you afraid of death?”</p><p>Leiyi roared.</p><p>hehehe, don’t think that I don’t know. We brothers have been waiting and watching for a hundred years. Of course, we’re confident that we can make a move!</p><p>recently, no one has been preaching on the Dragon sovereign peak. Those existences above the five-star heavenly Emperor level have all left. Who can do anything to us brothers? ”</p><p>The Black Bat King laughed and stepped forward, revealing his five-star heavenly Emperor cultivation base.</p><p>Lu Ming, get out here and hand over all the combat weapons and life fruits you have. Also, we’ll take this path-understanding ancient tree!</p><p>With that, the Black Bat King stretched out a big hand and grabbed the pathunderstanding ancient tree on the top of the Dragon Emperor Peak.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lei Yi and the others, as well as the ancient body cultivator celestial Thearch, all rose into the sky and attacked the Black Bat King, blocking him.</p><p>However, at this moment, the space behind the black Bat King cracked open and two more figures appeared.</p><p>The other two kings of darkness had arrived!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
