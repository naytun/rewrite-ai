His divine power began to burn.</p><p>Although burning his Shen power like this was extremely taxing on him and would leave behind terrifying after-effects, he couldn’t care about it now!</p><p>As long as he could level the heaven realm and successfully split open the sky, the G.o.ds from beyond the heavens would definitely bestow him with treasures. His injuries and aftereffects were nothing.</p><p>He held a blood-red sword and slashed at the dark holy light cage.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The dark holy light cage shook violently. Every time sacred ancestor bloodheart’s sword hit it, Xic nianqing and Xie nianjun’s delicate bodies would tremble and their faces would turn paler.</p><p>It was obvious that sacred ancestor bloodheart’s attack had also put a great burden on them.</p><p>But they gritted their teeth and persevered.</p><p>Now, it all depended on who could hold on. Whoever could hold on would be the winner.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart attacked crazily, and she could unleash over a hundred strikes in an instant.</p><p>The two sides were in a stalemate.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was progressing smoothly.</p><p>He activated the doubling of his combat power, and his combat power skyrocketed. He kept bombarding the power of the heavenly Dao, breaking the restraints of the heavenly Dao into pieces.</p><p>In the end, the spear spun and swept across the sky, completely blasting away the power of the heavenly</p><p>Dao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the aura on Lu Ming’s body exploded and rose to its peak.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his long hair flying in the wind. Then, a loud boom erupted from his body. He had broken through a bottleneck!</p><p>His realm had risen to a whole new level.</p><p>That was the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to be able to control and dominate everything. The entire heaven realm was under his control. The battlefield of the sinkhole and the great battle in two world city were also under his perception.</p><p>“Has the final battle begun?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Previously, he had been cultivating with all his heart, trying to break through to the next realm. He had no other thoughts in his mind. He didn’t expect that the final battle had already begun.</p><p>‘Little Qing, Qiu Yue, Xiang Xiang..”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed Xie nianqing, Lu Xiangxiang, and the rest. He was relieved to find that they were fine. Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and countless divine stones flew out.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had a breakthrough in his realm, his energy had not caught up. He had to absorb a large amount of energy and transform into World Energy and domination energy.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Countless G.o.dstones exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about wasting it now. What he wanted was to stabilize his cultivation as soon as possible and partic.i.p.ate in the big battle.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>Lu Ming absorbed it crazily. Endless divine Qi was swallowed into his body and transformed into the power of the world and the power of domination.</p><p>Lu Ming’s small world was expanding crazily.</p><p>not enough, far from enough. Speed up, speed up…</p><p>Lu Ming growled. In the end, he simply took out all the divine stones he had.</p><p>Piles of divine stones exploded and were devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>The amount of energy Lu Ming needed to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm was too shocking.</p><p>The main thing was that a portion of the energy would be converted into ruler’s power, which consumed the most energy.</p><p>Before Lu Ming left, he had more than ten thousand chaos gems left. However, to La Ming now, these chaos gems were like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood. They were not of much use to him. Therefore, Lu Ming had given them to Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and bubbles for use.</p><p>Lu Ming was now using the divine stone to cultivate.</p><p>Fortunately, he had obtained a large number of divine stones in the yellow Springs world.</p><p>Time continued to pa.s.s. Lu Ming’s aura grew stronger and more shocking. Of course, the number of divine. stones he devoured also increased.</p><p>The situation at the two world city battlefield had also entered a state of white heat.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun tried their best to stop sacred ancestor bloodheart, but the two’s faces turned</p><p>pale and blood kept flowing out of their mouths under her frenzied attacks.</p><p>killing heart, it’s too late.

When it exploded, the power was unbelievably great. Endless destructive power swept in all directions and struck the dark holy light cage.</p><p>In an instant, the dark holy light, cage exploded. Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s bodies were swept away by the force and were thrown back. They spat out blood and were severely injured.</p><p>“Dic!”</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart’s cycs were bloodshot as he pounced at Xic nianqing with endless killing intent. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His terrifying, withered hand reached out to grab Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing was severely injured and could not avoid this attack. If he was. .h.i.t, he would die.</p><p>At this critical moment, the s.p.a.ce in front of Xic nianging suddenly split open. A long spear flew out and stabbed at Saint ancestor bloodheart’s palm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The spear hit sacred ancestor bloodheart’s palm with a loud boom. The spear was knocked away, but sacred ancestor bloodheart was also forced back.

His body glowed with a bright light.</p><p>“Life fruit, you still have…”</p><p>Sccing Lu Ming take out the fruit of life, Saint ancestor bloodheart’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>“Do you want it? I have a lot of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Saint ancestor bloodheart and waved his hand. Nine life fruits appeared in his hand and one llew toward Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun caught the fruit of life without hesitation and swallowed it.
