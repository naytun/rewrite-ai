There’s no mistake. Whoever wins will get these divine crystals!”</p><p>“Kid, come on stage!”</p><p>Situ Xiao said coldly as he stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming also flew onto the platform and stood opposite situ Xiao.</p><p>that young man is only at the transformation void martial stage, but he actually dared to fight against a second level void G.o.d stage existence. Could it be that he has something to rely on? ”</p><p>I can’t figure it out. The difference between the transformation void martial stage and the ethereal G.o.d Realm is too big. Even the heaven’s pride experts can’t cross such a big realm to challenge someone!</p><p>his opponent is situ Xiao. I’ve heard of him before. He’s also a heaven’s favorite who has mastered King grade divine power!</p><p>“In that case, that young man is bound to lose?”</p><p>I don’t know. I can’t figure it out either. Let’s see!</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were discussing.</p><p>However, most of them felt that Lu Ming was definitely not his match. After all, the void transformation realm was only the first step of cultivation, while the virtual G.o.d Realm was the second step.</p><p>Only one step away, but the difference was like the difference between heaven and earth. Only those heaven-defying geniuses could possibly cross the gap.</p><p>However, how could a small place like the chaotic astral River have such a heaven’s favorite?</p><p>However, there was also a group of people who felt that Lu Ming was very confident. Since he dared to accept the challenge, he should have something to rely on. They were very curious about what exactly Lu Ming was relying on.</p><p>Everyone was staring at the two people on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Kid, I’ll make you kneel in three moves!”</p><p>A thick killing intent flashed in situ Xiao’s eyes. His figure flashed and he appeared in front of Lu Ming like a flash of light. He raised one hand and pressed down. Divine power whistled and pressed down on Lu Ming like Mount Tai. He wanted to force Lu Ming to his knees on the spot.</p><p>Situ Xiao was very confident.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite and had King-grade divine power. He was much stronger than other experts of the same level. Even second level void G.o.d Realm experts couldn’t withstand this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression did not change at all. He pointed his fingers like a sword and stabbed them toward situ Xiao’s palm.</p><p>“You’re looking for death! Then I’ll break your fingers!”</p><p>Situ Xiao grinned hideously and increased his strength.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s finger and situ Xiao’s palm collided with each other, creating a violent boom. A figure was forced to take five or six steps back before he could regain his balance.</p><p>The one who retreated was naturally situ Xiao.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually forced situ Xiao to retreat with one move. This was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>A transformation void martial stage forced back a second level void G.o.d stage heaven’s favorite with one move. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>I think situ Xiao underestimated his opponent and didn’t use his full strength. But this is still extremely shocking!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>At this moment, situ Xiao was also shocked.</p><p>There was a sharp pain in his palm where Lu Ming’s finger had pierced.</p><p>He had indeed underestimated his opponent just now and had only used seventy percent of his power. However, it was still extremely shocking. One had to know that he controlled King grade divine power.</p><p>this kid is a monster. I’ll cripple him today!</p><p>Situ Xiao roared in his heart. He unleashed all his strength and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He burst out with all his might as well. His entire body was covered in a dazzling purple-gold radiance as he charged toward situ Xiao.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them continued to clash and fought fiercely. For a moment, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Although situ Xiao was only at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm, his divine power was King-grade divine power. It was very dense and condensed, and his attack power was very strong. His strength was enough to fight against an existence at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had the cultivation base of a four-star heavenly Emperor. Without activating the battle character formula that doubled his combat strength, he could also fight with a third level void G.o.d Realm existence. Therefore, it was difficult to determine the winner between the two of them.</p><p>it seems like even King-grade divine power has a difference in strength!</p><p>As they fought, Lu Ming was thinking.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er also controlled King-grade divine power. However, Lu Ming felt that if they were at the same level, Tong Xi’ er would be stronger than situ Xiao.</p><p>There were also strong and weak King-grade divine powers.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can he be this strong?”</p><p>Situ Xiao roared in his heart. At this moment, he was a little anxious.</p><p>He did not want Lu Ming to kneel now. He was thinking about how to win. Otherwise, he would lose twenty thousand divine crystals.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, the most shocked person was Kang long!</p><p>His face was as white as snow, without a trace of blood, and he kept muttering, ” “How is that possible? How could this kid be so strong? d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>At the same time, he felt a lingering fear. Fortunately, Lu Ming did not agree to fight with him. Otherwise, he would have been defeated miserably.</p><p>“I hope situ Xiao can defeat him!”</p><p>Kang long prayed in his heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, his wish was destined to come to nothing.</p><p>is this all you’ve got? then let’s end this!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard. At the same time, his strength suddenly soared.</p><p>The double combat power of the battle formula was activated!</p><p>After activating the doubling of combat strength, Lu Ming’s combat strength was enough to fight with a fourth-level void G.o.d Realm existence. How could situ Xiao be a match for him?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch, and the terrifying force of his fist crushed toward situ Xiao with the force of a mountain.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Situ Xiao’s arm was broken by Lu Ming’s fist force. He retreated rapidly and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and continued to attack.</p><p>Situ Xiao took out a divine weapon to counterattack, but he was sent flying by Lu Ming with a few moves.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He raised his hand and pressed down. The power of domination condensed into a huge palm and pressed down on situ Xiao.</p><p>Situ Xiao roared and mustered all his strength to resist. However, he was no match for Lu Ming and could not withstand his power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The powerful force acted on situ Xiao’s body. His body arched and with a final thud, he knelt on the ground in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Situ Xiao roared madly. He was the young master of the Walkabout sect, and yet he was kneeling in front of Lu Ming. He was so mad with hatred that he wanted to grind Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? A loss is a loss, what’s the use of shouting!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated him. With a wave of his palm, situ Xiao’s body flew out of the fighting ring. He spat out a mouthful of blood and could not get up for a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill situ Xiao as it was unnecessary.</p><p>And if he really killed situ Xiao, free and unfettered sect would probably go crazy and attack the righteous Army with all their might, which would be disadvantageous to them.</p><p>“He lost! Situ Xiao actually lost!”</p><p>a transformation void martial artist can actually defeat a second level void G.o.d Realm heaven’s favorite. How is this possible? ”</p><p>“The power of a ruler! It’s the power of a ruler! He controls the power of a ruler!”</p><p>“What? It’s the power of a ruler. No wonder!”</p><p>The scene was noisy. Many people recognized Lu Ming’s power. It was the power of domination.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
