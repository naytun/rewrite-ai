It might contain some opportunities. Let’s form a team and explore it!</p><p>Then, the ancestral Dragon looked at the mountains and got the heaven realm beings to form small teams and enter the mountains to explore and see if they could find any opportunities.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was still on the island, comprehending the word ‘battle1.</p><p>He had been on this Island for ninety years.</p><p>After so many years of comprehension, he had benefited a lot.</p><p>The word ‘battle’ was too exquisite. As Lu Ming comprehended it, his combat experience deepened greatly.</p><p>Although he did not have any combat skills or divine abilities, Lu Ming’s fighting spirit soared to the sky whenever he made a move. Every move he made was filled with powerful combat power.</p><p>His previous battle skills and Sacred Arts were much more powerful now.</p><p>The word ‘combat’ was too intriguing. In other words, in the future, no matter what combat skills or divine abilities Lu Ming cultivated, the power would be enhanced.</p><p>No matter what weapon he used, he would be able to display the strongest power.</p><p>This was ‘battle’. As long as it was related to battle, it would be improved.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation level had not improved in the decades that he had comprehended the ‘battle’ character, his combat strength had increased by a notch.</p><p>Now, he was even more confident.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t have much confidence when facing an unrivaled demigod. Now, he was confident that he could fight.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the bottom of the cliff, Lu Ming’s body flashed and he flew around, casting all kinds of divine powers. Under the enhancement of the ‘battle’ character, the power of these divine powers was increased by a notch.</p><p>This cultivation lasted for nine days and nine nights.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after nine days and nine nights.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief, his eyes bright.</p><p>“Satisfying, this is really satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>At this moment, a crack appeared on the word ” battle “. Then, more and more cracks appeared. Finally, with a bang, it exploded. It was exactly the same as the statue from before.</p><p>Lu Ming had completely understood the word ‘battle’.</p><p>When the ‘battle’ word cracked, the void flickered, and the man with transparent wings reappeared.</p><p>not bad. To be able to fully comprehend this ‘battle’ formula within a hundred years, you have good talent!</p><p>yes. the transparent winged man nodded, and a hint of excitement flashed through the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Senior, can I enter the next stage now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Next round? That’s all, this is the last stage!”</p><p>The man with the transparent wings smiled.</p><p>“The last stage? Then I can go to the yellow Springs Island!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll send you there!”</p><p>The man with the transparent wings nodded and waved his hand. A disk array flew out and hovered above Lu Ming’s head. A beam of light shot out from the disk array and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he had stepped into the teleportation array. The next moment, his body disappeared from there.</p><p>He spun in the air. After a while, Lu Ming found himself in a wide hall.</p><p>“Where is this place? Could it be the yellow Springs Island?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>He had thought that he would appear on the island, but he had not expected to appear in a Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around. The hall was empty except for a statue at the very top.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Wasn’t this the statue that he had been looking at previously?</p><p>However, the statue here did not seem to be in control at all. Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>At this moment, a shadow flickered in the sky, and a figure appeared.</p><p>It was a refined middle-aged man in a white robe.</p><p>This middle-aged man was the one who had appeared above the fruit of life and warned zu long and the others.</p><p>congratulations on passing all the checkpoints and coming here!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the junior generation greets the senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“I’m white tooth!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve mastered the path of domination. It’s a rare talent for you. It’s very similar to what master has cultivated!” The elegant middle-aged man smiled.</p><p>“The Dao of a sovereign? senior, is there really such a Dao in the world? This is a name I randomly came up with!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Randomly named? Hahaha, that’s a coincidence. That’s right, there’s indeed The Way of the Master in the world. Once one cultivates The Way of the Master and breaks through to the martial God Realm, he can control the divine power of the master, which is an extremely high-level divine power!”</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“The war god level, and a sovereign’s divine power?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s something for the Battlegod realm. Your cultivation is still weak, so you don’t have to worry about it!</p><p>of course! Bai Ya said, ” most importantly, you’ve passed all the stages and arrived here. You’ve also cultivated the path of a ruler and can inherit master’s inheritance!</p><p>“Inheritance?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>let me tell you, my master is an extremely powerful existence with unparalleled talent and unfathomable cultivation base. The entire netherworld mountain is one of my master’s treasures!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped, his heart in turmoil.</p><p>The entire netherworld mountain was a treasure of master white tooth.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>The area of netherworld mountain was comparable to the nine heavenly regions of the heaven realm combined. It was vast and there were countless creatures living there, even martial gods.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had encountered several experts on the netherworld Island. The man with transparent wings and the elegant man in front of him were both unfathomable. Lu Ming suspected that they were both at the martial God Realm.</p><p>It was obvious that the master white tooth had mentioned was stronger than the martial God.</p><p>Someone even stronger than the martial God actually existed in this world?</p><p>Before this, Lu Ming had thought that the martial God was the most powerful existence in the world. However, it seemed that he was far from it.</p><p>There were existences even more powerful than the war god.</p><p>It was said that netherworld mountain came from beyond the sky. Therefore, there must be an existence stronger than the martial God Realm in the so- called beyond the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with yearning and anticipation.</p><p>With his cultivation base, he was almost at the peak.</p><p>In the entire heaven realm, the evil god tribe did not have many opponents. Now that he knew that there were stronger people above the martial God Realm, Lu Ming had even higher goals.</p><p>“I can obtain the inheritance of such an existence?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart was burning.</p><p>my master’s name is JingYu, and this statue here is my master. You must have seen my master’s statue in many places before, right? that’s because this treasure belongs to my master, and that’s why there are many places where my master’s statue is enshrined!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. He finally understood why there was a statue in every cursed land.</p><p>unfortunately, my master is dead. He was harmed by evil people. Meanwhile, we and this netherworld mountain are sealed here. For generations, we will never be able to leave!</p><p>Bai Ya’s eyes flashed with a hint of ferocity and killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
