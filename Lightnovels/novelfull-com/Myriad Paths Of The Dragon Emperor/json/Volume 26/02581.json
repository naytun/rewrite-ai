Even though they had already stabilized their cultivation in the void G.o.d Realm, they were still shocked.</p><p>Furthermore, this was not the end. Xie nianging and Xic nianjun’s auras were still rising.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, the two of them seemed to have turned into two suns.</p><p>One was as black as ink, while the other was Holy and purc!</p><p>They were like two suns, one black and one white, hanging in the sky, illuminating the entire gra.s.sland.</p><p>At this moment, the entire gra.s.sland and hundreds of giant cities could see the situation here.</p><p>Such a commotion was too terrifying.</p><p>Xiao Qing and Xie nianjun’s breakthrough is much more shocking than the others!</p><p>Lu Ming also sighed in his heart.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming could sense that. Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s auras were dozens of times stronger than the others.</p><p>Furthermore, it was still getting deeper.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not far from Lu Ming, a shadow flashed and a figure appeared. It was the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Clearly, even the ancestor of technique was alarmed.</p><p>it’s transforming. It’s constantly transforming. Is it controlling the divine grade divine power?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique muttered. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>&Nbsp; huhu…</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s attraction was getting stronger and stronger. Endless divine Qi rolled towards the two, but it obviously couldn’t keep up with the speed of their refining.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He waved his hand and divine crystals appeared one after another.</p><p>A total of 2000 Yuan. 1000 Yuan went to Xie nianqing, and 1000 Yuan went to Xie nianjun!</p><p>As soon as the divine crystals reached their bodies, they exploded one by one, turning into extremely dense divine Qi that flew into their bodies and were absorbed.</p><p>A day later, they had finished absorbing all one thousand divine crystals. However, they didn’t seem to want to stop.</p><p>there are still three thousand Yuan left. I’ll use them all!</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and decided to throw out the remaining three thousand divine crystals. However, at this moment, the ancestor of technique, who was not far away from Lu Ming, waved his hand and divine crystals flew out towards Xic nianqing and Xic nianjun.</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan and found out that there were a total of six thousand divinc crystals. Each of them had three thousand divine crystals.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>These divine crystals also exploded one by one, turning into divine Qi that was absorbed by the two. However, after a few days, the two of them still didn’t stop cultivating.</p><p>The ancestor of technique waved his hand again, and another 1000 divine crystals flew out.</p><p>This time, he finally had enough.</p><p>When they finished absorbing the 2000 divine crystals, their auras finally reached their peak and then slowly stabilized.</p><p>He had broken through to the martial G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Both Xie nianging and Xie nianjun had entered the martial G.o.d Realm and were at Ly 1 void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Senior ancestor of technique, many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the ancestor of technique and cupped his fists thanks.</p><p>This time, if the ancestor of technique had not taken out ten thousand divine crystals, Lu Ming would not have had enough divine crystals.</p><p>“It’s only a little divine crystal. No need to thank me. These two women aren’t simple!’</p><p>The ancestor of technique said with a smile. He then turned into a beam of light and left..</p><p>“He’s not simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming also muttered in his heart.</p><p>When Xic nianqing and Xie nianjun were below the BattleG.o.d realm, their performance was already amazing, However, when they broke through to the BattleG.o.d realm, it seemed that they were even more amazing. It was as if some kind of transformation had occurred.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s previous life, or Xie nianjun’s previous life, was probably not a small matter.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to ask Xie nianqing about this a few times, but Xie nianqing seemed to have some reservations and was unwilling to say more.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to get Xie nianjun beat around the bush, but Xie nianjun did not want to say more, so Lu Ming could only give up.</p><p>“Congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianging and Xie nianjun’s auras had stabilized. Zu long and the others quickly went up to congratulate them.</p><p>Becoming a martial G.o.d was equivalent to stepping into another level of life, becoming a G.o.d and stepping into the second step of cultivation. This was no small matter.</p><p>Xie nianjun was very cold. He simply nodded and stepped into the air, leaving the place.</p><p>“Many thanks to all the seniors!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled and nodded. Then, he flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, zu long and the others also left.</p><p>“Little Qing, how do you feel?”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and said.</p><p>“I feel fine. Do you want to exchange a few moves with me?”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and looked at Lu Ming with a faint smile.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you still thinking of stepping on me?”</p><p>Lu Ming joked.</p><p>When he first met. Xie nianqing, Xie nianqing had been thinking about stepping on him every day.</p><p>“What’s wrong? It won’t work!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and planted a kiss on Xic nianqing’s Red lips. Then, he retreated and stood opposite Xic</p><p>nianqing.</p><p>“Since you dared to take advantage of me, I’m going to eat you back!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flickered. In a flash, he charged at. Lu Ming.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He took a heavy step back and his figure retreated rapidly. Then, his entire body was filled with a dazzling purple-gold light. Lu Ming had circulated about eighty percent of the Dao of domination and sent out a palm.</p><p>The powerful palm force rushed towards Xie nianqing like a mountain.</p><p>Xie nianqing also struck out with his palm. His palm was as white as Jade and was wrapped in a layer of black</p><p>light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two palms collided.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt a terrifying force surging toward him. Lu Ming’s arm was in severe pain, and he retreated a hundred miles.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>He had already used 80% of his strength, but he couldn’t block Xie nianging’s attack at all. He retreated</p><p>quickly, but Xie nianqing didn’t even move.</p><p>“Use your full strength, or you won’t be my match!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>“It seems like I can only use my full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He pushed his path of domination to its limits. At the same time, he had already started to activate the battle character formula.</p><p>Since he came here, Lu Ming had not stopped his comprehension. His understanding of the battle symbol art was getting deeper and deeper. The success rate of triggering the double combat strength of the battle symbol art had also increased.</p><p>After a few moves, Lu Ming successfully triggered it and his combat strength soared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xic nianqing was like a black stream flight as he charged towards Lu Ming and struck out with his palm</p><p>again.</p><p>Lu Ming also struck out a palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows for the second time. An earth-shattering boom erupted in the sky, and the force spread in all directions. Then, a figure retreated rapidly. It was still Lu Ming.</p><p>“This strength…</p><p>Lu Ming was really shocked.</p><p>He had unleashed his full power and even activated the double combat power of the battle formula. With this level of combat power, he could easily kill an ordinary second level void G.o.d Realm. However, he was still</p><p>crushed by Xie nianqing,</p><p>“Continuc!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued. He rushed towards Kie nianqing without any hesitation and unleashed his full strength.</p><p>He and Xie nianging exchanged blows and fought fiercely.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
