Rays of sword-like light slashed at Lu Ming with even greater power!</p><p>At the same time, ao Gu himself also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear to fight against the rays of light. He also wanted to fight against ao Gu.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The area was filled with explosions and terrifying energy.</p><p>Lu Ming separated a trace of his nominator power to block the creatures from the prison realm and heaven realm. Otherwise, the overflowing Qi would have killed them.</p><p>There were more than ten consecutive explosions, and he was forced back ten steps.</p><p>“The power of the divine ancestor’s treasure is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>At this moment, ao Gu was madly activating the treasure of the non-human race’s divine ancestor. The power that erupted was extremely powerful. It was equivalent to the attack of a demigod master. With ao Gu’s own strength, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, the divine ancestor’s treasure was only a treasure after all. It was not a truly invincible expert and still needed ao Gu to control it. In this way, it did not give Lu Ming as much pressure as the two unparalleled experts.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming was pushed back was that he had to divert his attention to protecting the people from the prison suppression field and the heaven realm.</p><p>we have to end this quickly. The commotion here will probably alarm the upper echelons of the evil god tribe very soon!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, appear!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled. His glabella glowed, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew out. It grew rapidly and blasted toward the light emitted by the divine ancestor’s treasure.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The light struck the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Although the Divine Nine- Dragon Cauldron kept shaking, it managed to block the attack.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was refined by the ancestral Dragon and the nine Dragons together. With the ancestral Dragon’s help, its grade had already surpassed the heaven Dao soldiers. Although it had not reached the level of a divine artifact, its power was still shocking.</p><p>In terms of grade, it wasn’t any weaker than the treasure of the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>In addition, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s power was even more terrifying. It blocked the attack of the divine ancestor’s treasure in one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>stop! Lu Ming shouted. Now that he had blocked the treasure, he could focus on dealing with ao Gu.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his spear and charged towards ao Gu.</p><p>Ao Gu’s pupils shrank. He also attacked with his full power.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few blows.</p><p>Ao Gu was violently shaken. His body was sent flying backward, crashing into a broken wall and shattering it into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not give ao Gu any chance to catch his breath. He quickly charged over and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>One after another, the spear shadows overlapped and enveloped ao Gu.</p><p>how is this possible? how can he be this strong? ”</p><p>Ao Gu was shocked. He tried his best to resist but he was at a complete disadvantage. He was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>One had to know that his cultivation had already reached the demigod realm.</p><p>To be able to reach this level, which one of them wasn’t an unparalleled genius with shocking talent?</p><p>Who could be stronger than who?</p><p>Their combat strength was almost the same!</p><p>Even if there were outstanding talents such as the primal Chaos Emperor and the undying Emperor, they were not this powerful even though they were strong and could suppress demigods of the same level.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten moves had been exchanged. Ao Gu was whipped by Lu Ming’s long spear. A large hole was blasted in his body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s abilities were getting stronger and stronger. He could fight two demigod-level figures for a few hundred moves without being defeated, let alone a demigod. It was completely one-sided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow and directly charged out of the area covered by the restriction of the eternal cage.</p><p>Damn it, how did this happen? Where did this monster come from?”</p><p>Ao Gu roared in his heart.</p><p>He had a very high seniority in the evil god race and had existed since ancient times. In the past, he had always been in seclusion and had only been invited out recently to take charge of the eternal cage.</p><p>In the past few years, Lu Ming had been showing off his power in the heaven realm. He did not know about it, so he was naturally shocked.</p><p>I have to hold on. The divine ancestor should sense it soon. When the reinforcements arrive, this kid will be dead!”</p><p>Ao Gu gritted his teeth and defended with all his strength. He didn’t want to win, but he wanted to avoid any mistakes.</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared on the peak of the evil god tribe’s holy mountain.</p><p>This figure was the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>However, this wasn’t the true body of the non-human divine ancestor, but his projection. His true body was still healing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really bold!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s eyes were cold. He could sense what was happening over there through the eternal cage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jade tokens appeared in his hand. Then, inscriptions appeared and entered the Jade tokens. Then, the Jade tokens turned into rays of light and flew into the dark void, disappearing at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you actually dared to come to the evil god Realm. This time, we’ll completely get rid of this future trouble!”</p><p>The foreign divine ancestor murmured.</p><p>At this moment, in the evil god World, in a magnificent palace, a middle-aged man wearing a crown was discussing matters in the main hall. Suddenly, he stretched out his hand and received a jade talisman.</p><p>“Eh? Lu Ming, it’s this Lu Ming again. He’s courting death!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the eyes of the king of the foreign tribe. “This King has important matters to attend to, you all withdraw first!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>His subordinates retreated one after another.</p><p>The king of the non-human race took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>In another King City, another King also received a jade talisman and left the palace.</p><p>A few non-human Kings who were guarding the non-human army in the nine nether heavenly domain also received the Jade talismans.</p><p>Damn it, Lu Ming actually ran to the eternal cage. He’s courting death!”</p><p>“The two of you stay here and guard the place. We’ll go back and hunt Lu Ming down!”</p><p>Of the four kings, two stayed and two left. They tore open space and charged towards the evil god World.</p><p>A non-human King from the returning ruins city’s camp had also returned to the evil god World.</p><p>At this moment, a total of seven demigod non-human experts were rushing toward the eternal cage.</p><p>However, the non-human divine ancestor didn’t attack.</p><p>He was just a projection, and his strength was far inferior to his actual body. At most, he was equivalent to a peak heavenly Emperor, so he couldn’t do much even if he attacked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Over at the eternal cage, the battle was still ongoing.</p><p>Lu Ming completely suppressed ao Gu. The long spear struck down like a storm. Ao Gu was like a small boat in the sea that could be drowned by the sea water at any time.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and exerted his strength to the extreme.</p><p>Ao Gu was fully focused on defense. How could Lu Ming not know what he was thinking? he was stalling for time and waiting for help.</p><p>How could Lu Ming let him have his wish?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept across ao Gu. Ao Gu screamed in pain and flew out. His body directly exploded and was split into two.</p><p>However, the two halves of ao Gu’s body instantly fused together. His muscles wriggled as he tried to recover. However, his aura had weakened greatly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged over. Although ao Gu tried his best to block, his combat strength had been weakened. How could he block it? after a few moves, he was hit by Lu Ming again.</p><p>This time, it was even worse. His body exploded and turned into dust, leaving only his head behind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
