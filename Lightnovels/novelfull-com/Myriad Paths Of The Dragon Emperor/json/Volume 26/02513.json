Cold killing intent emanated from the two of them.</p><p>But in the end, they both had their own concerns and did not make a move.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>At this moment, the two of them discovered at the same time that not far from them, there was a towering tree.</p><p>This tree was extremely huge. It was at least a few hundred meters in diameter and was so tall that it reached the clouds. The entire tree, not only the trunk but also the leaves, were suffused with multicolored light.</p><p>However, the most eye-catching thing was the fruit on the tree.</p><p>There were 18 fruits in total, each the size of a fist. However, they immediately attracted the attention of the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>“Life fruit, it’s the life fruit!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor murmured, his eyes burning with fire.</p><p>He had finally found the fruit of life.</p><p>Didn’t he enter the yellow Springs world for the life fruit?</p><p>With the fruits of life, his injuries could be healed. If he had enough fruits of life, sacred ancestor bloodheart’s injuries could also be healed. At that time, he would be able to easily flatten the heaven realm.</p><p>At the same time, the ancestral dragon’s eyes shone with a burning light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Almost at the same time, the two of them moved and pounced towards the life fruit.</p><p>The two of them reached out their hands at the same time and grabbed at the life fruit.</p><p>But at this moment, the entire Tree of Life glowed. Then, two roots reached out from the ground and whipped at the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The power of the roots was unbelievably strong. The hands of the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor were crushed, and they were forced back.</p><p>The two of them had grave expressions on their faces.</p><p>The next moment, the two of them moved again. They burst out with all their strength and revealed their strength to the extreme as they pounced toward the fruit tree of Life.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>This time, the ground churned, and more than a dozen roots appeared all of a sudden, lashing at the two of them like a storm.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them continuously collided with the roots, and their bodies shook violently. They were sent flying far away, and they spat out blood at the same time.</p><p>The two of them were actually injured!</p><p>They were two martial gods, and yet they were injured by the roots of the fruit of life. If the people of the heaven realm and the evil god Realm saw this, they would be shocked.</p><p>The two of them had a gloomy look in their eyes.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon didn’t feel anything, but the non-human divine ancestor’s face was especially ugly. His desire for the life fruit was too strong, far stronger than the ancestral Dragon’s.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared in anger. He had gone through so much to come here, but he couldn’t get the life fruit?</p><p>At this moment, the space above the fruit of life started to ripple. Then, a figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man in a white robe. He looked very refined. He must have been a refined young master when he was young.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor and the ancestral Dragon looked at this man with caution.</p><p>That was because they could not see through this person’s cultivation realm.</p><p>“This time, only the two of you are war gods!”</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man glanced at the ancestral Dragon and the non- human divine ancestor and asked in a soft voice. He seemed a little confused.</p><p>“Right now, the only martial gods in the outside world are the two of us!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said.</p><p>“There are only two war gods left. Strange. What’s happening outside? Where is this place?”</p><p>The middle-aged man mumbled to himself and then looked at the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor, you want the fruit of life, right? the fruit of life only ripens once in countless years. It’s not time for it to ripen yet!</p><p>“Not mature yet?”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor were both dazed.</p><p>that’s right, it hasn’t ripened yet, so if you want to pick it, the fruit tree of Life will automatically attack. However, once it ripened, as long as you don’t damage the fruit tree of Life, it won’t fight back!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man explained.</p><p>“How long will it take for the fruit of life to ripen?”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor asked.</p><p>soon. This time, the life fruit is about to ripen. As for how long, I can’t say. It’ll take a few years if it’s fast, or a few hundred years if it’s slow. You just have to wait for a while!</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man smiled. Then, he looked into the distance and said in a low voice, ” “Can that little guy pass the test or not?”</p><p>“I hope so. After all these years, someone has finally mastered the Dao of a sovereign. At least there’s a bit of hope!”</p><p>With that, he turned around and disappeared.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human sacred ancestor exchanged a glance, killing intent in their eyes.</p><p>At most, a few hundred years was nothing to them. They just had to wait.</p><p>When the life fruit ripened, the two of them would definitely have an intense battle to fight for it.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, in particular, really wanted to kill the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>This was because the heaven realm would be in grave danger if the divine ancestor of the non-human race were to obtain more fruits of life.</p><p>But in the end, they were still not confident. The two of them did not make a move rashly. They sat at the side and waited.</p><p>Time flew by quickly. After several years, a third person finally arrived at the yellow Springs Island. It was the heavenly realm’s venerable sky Thunder Emperor.</p><p>A few months later, another unrivaled expert from the evil god tribe arrived.</p><p>Then, more and more people came to Yellow Springs Island.</p><p>Ten years later, hundreds of people from each side came to Yellow Springs Island.</p><p>The test they passed was different for each of them. It didn’t mean that those with low cultivation couldn’t pass the test. Therefore, there were people with high and low cultivation on both sides.</p><p>They had been warned by the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor to stay away from the fruit of life.</p><p>If anyone below the martial god level was struck by the roots of the fruit of life, they would really die.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Suddenly, a burst of rich fragrance came from the fruit of life.</p><p>This fragrance made people feel comfortable all over as all the pores on their bodies opened up. Some people’s hidden injuries were quickly recovering.</p><p>The life fruit had ripened!</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human sacred ancestor were the fastest to react. They rushed toward the fruit of life.</p><p>This time, when they approached the fruit tree of Life, the fruit tree of Life didn’t attack.</p><p>The life fruit had ripened!</p><p>“Ancestral Dragon, die!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor suddenly roared, turned around, and charged toward the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon had the same thought as he charged at the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>The two martial God powerhouses were engaged in a fierce battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
