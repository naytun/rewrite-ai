He joined forces with Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er to resume their hunt for desolate beasts and beast cores.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two huge metal bears appeared in front of him. Their auras were very shocking. They were both at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>This forest was even more dangerous than the previous one. They had just entered and they had already encountered two third level void G.o.d Realm existences.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over directly. At the same time, he continuously triggered the battle formula.</p><p>After a few times, the double combat power of the battle formula was triggered.

In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>The two giant bears were furious and their roars were like thunder. The power of the bear paws grew stronger and stronger, causing Lu Ming to feel immense pressure. There were a few times when he was almost hit by the bear paws.</p><p>“Yes, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, his eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>This kind of pressure and the feeling of danger would allow him to improve faster. It would be very useful for both the path of domination and the comprehension of the battle character formula.</p><p>“Kill!”‘</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged at a giant bear. The giant bear roared angrily and slapped its palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body slanted slightly, avoiding the blow to his vital parts.

It was about to charge at Lu Ming when something happened.</p><p>The metal ball, which was initially lying limply on Lu Ming’s shoulder, suddenly turned into a rainbow light and rushed over.</p><p>The metal ball’s body turned into a sharp spike and stabbed at the giant bear’s chest.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The bear’s chest was pierced through, leaving a hole in its back. The metal ball flew out from the bear’s back and turned into a circle again. In the middle of the circle, a mouth and eyes full of fangs appeared. On both sides, metal liquid extended out like two tentacles.</p><p>On the tentacle, there was a piece of golden metal. It was the beast core of the metal bear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As for the giant bear, it had fallen straight to the ground and was no longer breathing.</p><p>What made Lu Ming and the rest even more dumbfounded was that the metal ball actually swallowed the beast core in one bite and began to chew it with a crunching sound.</p><p>The remaining giant, metal bear roared and actually revealed a terrified expression. II. turned around and ran. Buzzzzz!</p><p>The metal ball turned into a beam of light and charged at the metal bear.</p><p>The metal bear’s defense was completely useless against the metal ball. The metal ball pierced through its body, leaving a hole in its chest.</p><p>As for the beast core, it naturally fell into the metal ball.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The metal ball then stuffed the beast core into its mouth and began to gobble it up. Its eyes revealed a very human-like expression of enjoyment.</p><p>“This is also fine…</p><p>Lu Ming was in a daze.</p><p>Judging from the aura of the metal ball, it should be at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. However, the two giant metal bears at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm could not resist. it. at all.</p><p>It was as if the metallic sphere was capable of restraining these metallic lifeforms.</p><p>Then, Lui Ming’s heart ached. Two third level void G.o.d-level beast cores were eaten by the metal ball just like that. That was worth forty divine crystals.</p><p>“You can counter these metallic lifeforms?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and picked up the metal ball.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The metal ball chewed a few times with its big mouth, and its eyes revealed a proud expression.</p><p>It was as if he was saying, of course”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>okay, help us hunt metal desolate beasts in the future. However, you can’t eat the desolate beast’s heart. You have to give it to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The metal ball bit down a few more times, and the entire metal ball started to spin. It was clearly rejecting</p><p>the offer,</p><p>“You don’t agree? If you don’t agree, I’ll stuff you into my storage ring and you won’t be able to get a single</p><p>piece!”</p><p>Lu Ming threatened.</p><p>The metal ball’s mouth clenched with all its might, and its eyes revealed a furious expression.</p><p>“Then I’ll keep you in my storage ring…</p><p>Lu Ming did not compromise.</p><p>After a round of bargaining, he finally reached an agreement with the metal ball.</p><p>Half of the beast cores that the metal ball had hunted would be given to Lu Ming and the other half would be</p><p>left for it to eat.</p><p>Half each!</p><p>After their discussion, they set off.</p><p>Not long after, they encountered a few more desolate beasts. However, when the metal ball appeared, these desolate beasts seemed to be very afraid. They were easily killed by the metal ball and their beast cores were</p><p>taken away.</p><p>The metal ball pa.s.sed half of the beast core to Lu Ming and stuffed the other half into its mouth, eating it</p><p>noisily.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were overjoyed. This way, their efficiency in hunting for beast cores would be greatly</p><p>enhanced.</p><p>Following that, they rampaged through the forest, their speed of hunting desolate beasts greatly increased. Lu Ming realized that even if he encountered fourth-level void G.o.d-level dire beasts, the metal ball could easily deal with them. It was just slightly more troublesome.</p><p>Most of the time, Lu Ming and the rest did not need to do anything.</p><p>Sometimes, when he met a suitable opponent, Lu Ming had to block the metal ball to have a chance to train,</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had been in this forest for three days.</p><p>In these three days, they had gained a lot.</p><p>They had obtained more than 1000 beast cores from level one to level four of the void G.o.d Realm. If they were to exchange them for divine crystals, they would have obtained more than 20000 divine crystals. It had only been a few days, and they had already gained so much.
