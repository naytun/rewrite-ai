He was frowning.</p><p>After another hundred years, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had reached the limit of peak great emperor. He felt that he could break through to the heavenly Emperor realm at any time.</p><p>However, the force between heaven and earth that was blocking him was too strong. He could not break through it!</p><p>my combat power is still not enough. It’s hard to break through the power of the heavenly Dao!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>After more than two hundred years of cultivation, Lu Ming realized that his cultivation speed of the ‘battle formula’ was still too slow.</p><p>Furthermore, he seemed to have reached a bottleneck in his cultivation of the ‘battle formula’. It had been more than ten years and he had not improved at all.</p><p>the battle symbol art must be improved in battle. Only in battle can the comprehension of the battle symbol art be faster!</p><p>furthermore, I’ve reached a bottleneck. I’ll have to go through an intense battle to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>However, at his current level, there were not many people who could fight with him.</p><p>Even if he went to find demigods from the heaven realm to fight, they were all from the heaven realm, so it was impossible for him to fight to the death. The effect would definitely not be good.</p><p>“Evil god tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. He thought of the evil god race.</p><p>The evil god tribe was the best Whetstone.</p><p>“Then I’ll use you guys as practice first!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and left the place of seclusion. He took a step forward and the space cracked open. Lu Ming stepped into the space and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, he appeared on the battlefield outside two world city.</p><p>All these years, the evil god tribe had always been focused on defense. However, they would also send some people to fight with the heaven realm on the battlefield. Therefore, the heaven realm and the evil god tribe would often fight on this battlefield. However, they were all small-scale, and there were no large-scale battles.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and headed in the direction of the Hunyuan heavenly realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After walking for a while, Lu Ming heard intense battle cries ahead.</p><p>A group of people were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Some were from the heaven realm, some were from the evil god tribe, and there were hundreds of them in total.</p><p>Both sides fought fiercely, with people dying from time to time.</p><p>Lu Ming walked straight toward the battlefield.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A tall evil god Clansman saw Lu Ming and charged at him with a battle axe in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A piece of muscle on Lu Ming’s chest shook violently. The vibration of the muscle and the space shook rapidly, forming a terrifying force.</p><p>The foreign being’s body exploded under the force.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current physical state, he did not even need to make a move. The terrifying power that erupted from the vibration of his muscles was enough to kill the enemy.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As Lu Ming took a step forward, the bodies of all the evil god tribe members who got close to him exploded and died on the spot.</p><p>However, the living beings in the heaven realm were also fine!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>What kind of technique was this? they had not seen Lu Ming make a move, but the evil god tribe members had already died.</p><p>” Lu Ming, he’ s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed as he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. No wonder!</p><p>The people from the heaven realm were overjoyed.</p><p>As for the evil god race members, they were afraid and turned to run.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and a purple-gold light flashed across the void. All the evil god tribe members were killed on the spot.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>he’s too powerful. Is this Lu Ming’s strength? those evil god tribe members can’t even withstand a single blow!</p><p>The people from the heaven realm were shocked to see Lu Ming kill hundreds of alien races with ease.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop after killing hundreds of alien races. He continued to move forward.</p><p>“Where is Lu Ming going? Could it be that he wants to kill his way to the camp of the non-humankind?”</p><p>it’s been a long time since someone of this level made a move. This is a big deal!</p><p>“Haha, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The heaven realm beings followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. Along the way, he encountered a few fights. Lu Ming casually attacked and killed the evil god race.</p><p>After recognizing Lu Ming, the beings from the heaven realm followed him one by one. There were more than a thousand of them.</p><p>Finally, a huge object appeared in front of them. They had arrived at the evil god tribe’s military camp.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s camp was huge and blocked the path to the Hunyuan heavenly region.</p><p>The interior was densely packed with all kinds of buildings and countless evil god race members.</p><p>The camp was surrounded by large formations that flickered with light, protecting the camp.</p><p>In some places, the heaven realm beings and the evil god race were still fighting.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura began to rise. A long spear condensed by the ruler’s power appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and stood high in the air. He held the long spear with both hands and swung it forward with all his might.</p><p>The long spear in his hand grew rapidly, filling up the entire sky. It was even more majestic than a mountain range, and it pressed down toward the evil god tribe’s military camp.</p><p>“Not good, someone is attacking the camp!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s military camp was shaken, and countless figures flew around.</p><p>“Great formation, activate the great formation!”</p><p>don’t panic. Our formation is enough to stop them!</p><p>Their voices spread through the entire military camp.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s military camp lit up with beams of light. A huge beam of light enveloped the entire camp.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The purple-gold spear struck the light shield of the evil god tribe’s military camp heavily.</p><p>When the spear hit the light shield, the entire battlefield seemed to shake violently, sending dust into the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ground near the evil god tribe’s military camp exploded continuously, sending rocks flying everywhere. One after another, huge cracks appeared on the ground like a spider web.</p><p>The light barrier formed by the evil god tribe’s formation started to shake crazily. It was like an elastic bubble that was being crushed and caved in.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He exerted all his strength and pressed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The light barrier around the evil god tribe’s military camp exploded.</p><p>It was broken!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s military camp’s formation was broken by Lu Ming’s spear. The huge spear brought with it a terrifying aura and pressed down.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Countless members of the evil god race were shocked to death.</p><p>However, as the spear pressed down, it created an endless spatial storm. Many of the evil god tribe members were crushed into meat paste under the terrifying power before they could escape.</p><p>One by one, the members of the evil god tribe exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear finally struck the ground, causing countless buildings to explode. A huge spear mark that was five million miles long and a million miles wide appeared on the ground.</p><p>Tragic!</p><p>In that instant, countless members of the evil god tribe were killed by Lu Ming!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s military camp was a complete mess.</p><p>“Heavens!”</p><p>The beings of the heaven realm were all dumbfounded when they saw this.</p><p>Lu Ming had single-handedly destroyed the evil god tribe’s military camp with one move and killed countless members of the evil god tribe. He was too powerful!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
