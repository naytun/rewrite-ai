Including the one he gave to Xie nianqing, there were ten in total. Not only was the sacred ancestor bloodheart shocked, but the non-human sacred ancestor was equally shocked.</p><p>He clearly remembered that there were only 18 fruits of life on the fruit tree of Life. They had obtained 11. while the heaven realm had only obtained seven.</p><p>Lu Ming, where did you get so many life fruits?</p><p>“A fortuitous encounter. Lu Ming must have had a fortuitous encounter!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared in jealousy.</p><p>At the same time, he also thought about why the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others ‘cultivation had improved so much that they had broken through to the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>Why were the injuries of venerable sovereign rebellion and the others all recovered to their peak? it must be the fruit of life.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He had worked hard and only obtained 11 fruits of life, which were only enough for him and the bloodheart Saint patriarch. He was extremely depressed at the thought of Lu Ming obtaining a large number of fruits of life and greatly increasing the strength of the heaven realm.</p><p>As for sacred ancestor bloodheart, he was first shocked at the sight of so many life fruits, but then he became deeply greedy.</p><p>&Nbsp; his injuries had not fully healed, and now that he was burning his Shen power, he had used up a lot of his energy, adding more injuries to his own. If he could obtain so many life fruits, he would be able to quickly recover.</p><p>“Give me the life fruit!”</p><p>Sacred ancestor bloodheart roared.</p><p>“Give it to you? Come and get it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the life fruit and held the great desolation spear in his hand. His aura was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>La Ming, I didn’t devour you. Now, I’ll completely destroy you!”</p><p>die! Saint ancestor bloodheart roared. He turned into a beam of blood-red light and charged at Lu Ming. BOOM!</p><p>A bright purple-gold light rose from Lu Ming’s body. The world Energy and the ruler’s energy in his body circulated wildly. Then, he thrust his spear forward.</p><p>The great desolation spear quickly turned into a spear radiance and stabbed at Saint ancestor bloodheart. Thump!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, creating a terrifying shock wave that spread in all directions. The void was completely shattered.</p><p>The blood-red light shattered, and Saint ancestor bloodheart retreated. Lu Ming also retracted his spear. “What? In a head-on battle, Lu Ming blocked the attack of the killing heart’s divine ancestor!”</p><p>“Heavens, what did I just see? Did Lu Ming become a G.o.d?”</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>At this moment, be it the heaven realm or the evil G.o.d race, everyone was deeply shocked and stunned. Lu Ming was able to fight a martial G.o.d head-on.</p><p>This was too shocking,</p><p>The difference was that after the evil G.o.d tribe’s initial shock, they were filled with endless fear.</p><p>After the heaven realm’s side recovered from their shock, they were overjoyed.</p><p>hahaha! Mo ke, this time around, it’s your evil G.o.d race that should be exterminated!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon laughed out loud.</p><p>how is this possible? this is impossible!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s mind was</p><p>chaos. He simply couldn’t accept this.</p><p>He had planned for countless years and worked hard for countless years, but in the end, this was the result he got. He really couldn’t bear it.</p><p>If Lu Ming could fight against the sacred ancestor bloodheart, it would be very disadvantageous to them! There were still Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun in the heavenly realm.</p><p>“Killing heart, is this all you’ve got? Then today, the person I’m going to exterminate is you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and took a step forward. His figure was like a stream of light as he charged toward Saint ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>“Blood Sea Sword skill!”</p><p>die! Saint ancestor bloodheart roared. A blood sea appeared behind him, and endless blood-red sword light. flew out of the blood sea and slashed at Lu Ming,</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ruler’s power and dominated the world.</p><p>The ruler’s power acted on the blood-red sword-light, and the direction of the blood-red sword-light immediately changed slightly. It did not stab Lu Ming at all and all flew past him.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming approached holy ancestor bloodheart and swept. his spear out.</p><p>The spearlight was millions of miles long and it struck the blood sea.</p><p>The blood sea collapsed, and Saint ancestor bloodheart retreated.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The great desolation spear continued to pierce through the void, shattering it. Lu Ming and the killing heart Saint ancestor fought their way into the dark void.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm, his combat strength had increased greatly. When all aspects were combined, he could be compared to a martial G.o.d and was no weaker than the ancestral Dragon, the divine ancestor of the non-human race at his peak.</p><p>This was under the condition that Lu Ming had not triggered the double combat strength.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Saint ancestor bloodheart fought their way into the dark void. They exchanged several moves in a row, causing the dark void to tumble continuously.</p><p>The double combat strength of the battle character formula had ended after Lu Ming broke through to the celestial Thearch realm. Therefore, Lu Ming was only in his normal state and not in the state of doubling his combat strength.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the way of domination to the extreme. The power of the world and the power of domination howled in his body.</p><p>The Dominator’s power in Lu Ming’s body had already occupied more than half of the total power. This was also the key to Lu Ming’s ability to fight against the martial G.o.d.</p><p>In the future, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the proportion of the ruler’s energy would also increase. Lu Ming estimated that when he cultivated to the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm, all the world Energy in his body would be transformed into the ruler’s energy.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the battle symbol art. Although it did not trigger the double combat power, with the enhancement of the battle symbol art, Lu Ming’s every move was astonishingly powerful. He was evenly matched with the Saint ancestor bloodheart at his peak. In fact, Lu Ming was even slightly better. After Lu Ming and Saint ancestor bloodheart entered the dark void, Xic nianging and Xic nianjun had almost recovered from their injuries with the help of the fruits of life.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were cold as he scanned the crowd. Black lotuses appeared around him and turned into sword Qi that flew towards the giant.</p><p>The Giants of the sky-breaking Army were still fighting fiercely with the prison-suppressing stele. However, the trace of the prison-guarding patriarch’s scal in the prison-guarding stele had limited energy. After fighting for so long, it was almost unable to hold on.</p><p>It was the perfect time for Xie nianqing to make his move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant of the sky-breaking Army reached out with a huge hand and attacked Xie nianging’s sword Qi.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of clashing sounds rang out, and the heaven crushing Army’s giant body trembled violently as it retreated continuously. The ground beneath its feet continued to crack, and in a moment of carelessness, it crushed a few hundred evil G.o.d tribesmen who were unable to retreat in time.</p><p>Xie nianqing was able o fight with the martial G.o.d, sacred ancestor bloodheart, and his strength was above</p><p>the sky-breaking Army.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Xic nianqing shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, the endless sword light gathered into a huge black</p><p>sword Qi, which once again slashed at the giant formed by the sky breaking Army.</p><p>The giant raised his fist to block, but this time, his fist was directly cut in half by the sword light.</p><p>Within the list, many of the sky breaking Army’s experts exploded and died.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of heaven crushing Army experts were killed, including more than a dozen heavenly</p><p>cmperors.</p><p>The giant of the sky breaking Army retreated.</p><p>However, at this moment, a milky-white sword radiance slashed down from the sky.</p><p>Xie nianjun made his move!</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The head of the sky-breaking Army giant was cut off, and another few hundred of the sky-breaking Army fell.</p><p>As a result, the giant formed by the sky breaking Army directly collapsed. The formation was broken!</p><p>22</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
