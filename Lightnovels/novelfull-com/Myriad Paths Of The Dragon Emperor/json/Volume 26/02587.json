Many powerful desolate beasts had the concept of territories.</p><p>Some powerful desolate beasts would occupy a region. Within this region, other desolate beasts would not dare to stay.</p><p>“We have to be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>Immediately, they retracted their auras and wanted to leave this place in the direction they came from.</p><p>“Eh? There are many creatures on that mountain, and they aren’t metal, but flesh and blood!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianjun looked at a mountain peak not far away.</p><p>“A living being with flesh and blood means that they are like us, outsiders!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He didn’t doubt Xic nianjun’s senses. Xie nianjun had completely awakened the memories of her past life. Her methods were simply unfathomable.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look””</p><p>Xie nianqing suggested.</p><p>The group nodded and carefully made their way to the other mountain peak.</p><p>Not long after, they ascended another mountain peak, found a hidden place, and looked ahead.</p><p>They immediately saw a group of living beings.</p><p>There were about 20 people, and among them, there were creatures with a single horn and snake-people with scales on their skin.</p><p>There were at least six or seven races among the twenty people.</p><p>Some of them were wearing black battle armor, which was exactly the same as the three black-armored brawny men they had met before.</p><p>“The people from the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun’s eyes glinted coldly.</p><p>They realized that the people from the yuanluo Hall were also very careful. They hid in the dark and looked in other directions. They did not notice Lu Ming’s group at all.</p><p>They followed the direction of the yuanluo Palace’s gaze and saw a giant metal Eagle at the bottom of a cliff. In addition, there was also a cave.</p><p>From time to time, golden light would spread out from the cave.</p><p>“Eh? Could it be that there’s a treasure in that cave?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them were smart people. Upon seeing this situation, they thought about it and understood the general situation.</p><p>It was obvious that there were treasures in the cave. However, there was a terrifying giant. metal Eagle guarding the cave. The people from the yuanluo Palace didn’t dare to make a move. They were hiding there, waiting for the giant metal Eagle to leave.</p><p>“Then let’s be the Oriole!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile and the others nodded.</p><p>After that, they also started to wait here.</p><p>Time flew by and three days pa.s.sed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!….</p><p>At this time, the giant metal Eagle cried out. It had been lying on the ground all this time, but now it stood up and looked around with its cold eyes. Then, it flapped its wings and soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest quickly hid in the dark. They did not even dare to breathe loudly. This giant metal Eagle was definitely extremely terrifying,</p><p>If he was discovered, he would be finished.</p><p>Soon, the metal Eagle soared into the sky and flew into the distance, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, the people of the yuanluo Palace turned into streaks of light and rushed toward the broken cliff.</p><p>“What should we do?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er looked at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>There were many experts in the yuanluo Palace. No matter how strong Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were, they wouldn’t be a match for them.</p><p>“Kill with a borrowed knife, no, kill with a borrowed bird!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At this moment, more than 20 people from the yuanluo Palace had already rushed to the bottom of the cliff. They left a few people to guard the entrance of the cave while the others rushed into the cave.</p><p>“You guys wait for me here!”</p><p>Lu Ming left the mountain peak in a flash. After he descended, he took out a combat sword and injected his ruler’s power into it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A shocking sword light shot up into the sky and pierced through the firmament. It could be seen from far anway.</p><p>Then, the sword ray slashed towards the cave.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The few people guarding outside the cave were instantly enraged. They all moved to block the sword ray.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The energy was unrestrained, and the sword Qi soared to the sky.</p><p>Alter Lu Ming slashed, he turned and left.</p><p>His goal was not to deal with the people from the yuanluo Palace, but to create a commotion and lure the giant Eagle back.</p><p>Now that he had achieved his goal, he naturally slipped away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the distance, a deafening cry resounded through the firmament.</p><p>The giant metal Eagle had obviously seen the sword light and returned at top speed.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it…</p><p>Furious roars came from the cave, and the people from the yuanluo Palace rushed out of the cave.</p><p>The leader, the bald man, roared in anger.</p><p>“Who? who is it?”</p><p>A cold killing intent burst out from the bald man’s body as he looked at the guards.</p><p>“It’s a young man…”</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An ear-piercing screech was heard. In the distance, a black dot appeared. The giant Eagle had returned.</p><p>‘Let’s go!”</p><p>The bald man roared and ran away.</p><p>Ile was furious. He had just entered the cave and had not even gotten his hands on the treasure when he was alarmed by the return of the giant Eagle. Now, he could only escape.</p><p>More than 20 experts from the yuanluo Palace were running for their lives.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ear piercing sound was getting closer and closer.</p><p>The giant metal Eagle was too fast. Its wingspan was a hundred meters wide. Like a flash of lightning, it chased after the people from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>In the distance, a shrill scream and an angry roar could be heard.</p><p>‘Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three seized the opportunity and rushed toward the cave.</p><p>They didn’t have much time, and they had to seize the opportunity to take the treasure in the cave and leave.</p><p>If they waited for the giant Eagle to return, they would be in danger.</p><p>Like four streams of light, they rushed to the entrance of the cave. Without any hesitation, they rushed in.</p><p>Inside the cave, there was a pa.s.sage that was a hundred meters long. They rushed through the pa.s.sage and</p><p>appeared in a huge cave.</p><p>“This is…</p><p>When they rushed into the cave, they were stunned.</p><p>The cave was filled with all kinds of metals of different colors, which were bright and resplendent.</p><p>Moreover, many of the metals were shaped like plants, and metal flowers bloomed.</p><p>But other than that, there was nothing else.</p><p>“Eh? That’s …</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming noticed that one of the walls was slightly different. There was a spot that had a</p><p>different color from the wall.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over. When Lu Ming walked over, the different color on the wall actually started to wriggle.</p><p>It was actually a pool of liquid metal. It did not move at all earlier, but it only started to move when Lu Ming</p><p>walked in.</p><p>The liquid metal was shining and wriggling quickly. It turned into a metal ball and flew in another direction,</p><p>“A metal ball…</p><p>The four of them were very surprised.</p><p>Could it be that the treasure was this metal ball?</p><p>“Catch it…</p><p>The four of them didn’t hesitate and attacked. They charged at the metal ball from four directions.</p><p>(22</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
