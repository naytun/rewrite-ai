It could be said that they had turned out in full strength.</p><p>Moreover, the weakest of them were at the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>There were at least tens of millions of Emperor-to-be evil god tribe members, millions of empty Emperor realm evil god tribe members, and hundreds of thousands of true Emperor realm members.</p><p>Among them, there were tens of thousands of great emperors.</p><p>What kind of terrifying power was this? furthermore, the evil god race had great emperors as their generals, true emperors and void emperors as their backbones, and emperors-to-be as their soldiers. The power of the formations they had set up was even more shocking.</p><p>This level of power was not something that the evil god tribe’s previous attacks could compare to.</p><p>In the past, only a portion of the evil god tribe’s forces had attacked the two world city. Now, they were going all out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The defensive formation above the two world city began to rumble and shake violently. If this continued, it would not be able to defend for long.</p><p>Although the attack formation above the two world city continued to attack and killed a portion of the evil god tribe, it was like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood in the face of the endless tide of evil god tribe.</p><p>Sila!</p><p>Some of the defensive formations were torn apart.</p><p>Once a hole was opened, it was like water bursting out of a dam. It was unstoppable. The defensive array formation continued to collapse, and more and more cracks appeared.</p><p>“Kill! Level the heaven realm!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The endless evil god tribe members charged into the formation.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The heaven realm experts also charged toward the evil god tribe, and an intense battle broke out between the two sides.</p><p>However, neither side sent in any heavenly Emperor powerhouses.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor realm was the core power of both sides. It was very crucial.</p><p>If the evil god race did not make a move, the heaven realm would not make a move either. Otherwise, if they were to kill the evil god race below the heavenly Emperor stage, they would expend their energy and be killed by the heavenly Emperor instead. That would affect the battle situation.</p><p>The battle in both two world city and returning ruins city became more and more intense. In the end, the defensive formations of the two cities completely collapsed.</p><p>The powerhouses from both sides were fighting each other.</p><p>Both sides added up to almost a hundred million soldiers fighting. The scene was too shocking.</p><p>The city walls of two world city, which stretched for tens of millions of miles, were caught in the flames of war. Countless people were fighting, and their shouts shook the sky. Blood was everywhere.</p><p>“With my blood, I will exterminate the outsiders and Exchange for peace in the heavenly realm!”</p><p>A middle-aged man from the heaven realm let out a long roar. He had the cultivation base of a great emperor. His long blade swept out in a mighty manner, splitting an evil god tribe’s great emperor into two.</p><p>However, on the other side, a destructive light pierced through and killed the human.</p><p>Such situations were happening all over the battlefield.</p><p>On the battlefield, the situation was constantly changing. At every moment, a large number of people were dying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Li, Ouyang Wushuang, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Huang Li, and the others gathered together and formed a formation. They swept out and killed the evil god race members one by one.</p><p>They had all entered the netherworld Island and had a fortuitous encounter, which greatly improved their cultivation.</p><p>In the past two hundred years, they had refined the life fruit that Lu Ming had given them and their cultivation levels had increased explosively. Each of them had reached the peak great emperor realm.</p><p>With so many of them working together and forming a formation, they were invincible. Wherever they went, evil god race members were killed.</p><p>Not long after, they had already killed over a thousand members of the evil god race.</p><p>In the evil god World, the non-human sacred ancestor and the Kings were all watching.</p><p>Their faces were calm and unruffled.</p><p>To them, no matter how many members of the evil god race who were below the heavenly Emperor level died, they would not care.</p><p>What they cared about was whether they could finally level the heaven realm and successfully split open the sky. This was related to their future.</p><p>They didn’t care about the exotic beasts in particular.</p><p>On the battlefield of the ruins of end, the fighting was even more intense.</p><p>The strange beasts of the evil god tribe and the divine beasts of the heaven realm were fighting here.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s strange beasts were extremely crazy and fearless. They also caused the divine beasts in the heaven realm to suffer heavy losses.</p><p>“Form the divine beast formation!”</p><p>A voice rang out on the battlefield.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The roars of Dragons could be heard as the true dragons of the true dragon clan began to gather and combine together to form a large formation.

BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In front of returning bamboo city, the earth rumbled, and giant creatures appeared at the end of the world.</p><p>It was an extremely huge creature covered in black scales. There were many huge tentacles on its body, which looked like the tentacles of an octopus.</p><p>There was also a third eye in the center of their brows.</p><p>This was the giant whisker race of the evil god race. These living beings were extremely rare in the evil god race. However, when they matured, their bodies would be astonishingly huge. When they stood on the ground, they would truly be able to support the heavens and earth.</p><p>If Lu Ming were here, he would definitely be able to recognize that the passageway guarded by the Titan longhorn beetle was attacked by this kind of creature.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The giant beard Clansman stomped on the ground. With every step he took, the ground would explode and crack. A terrifying aura covered the sky and earth, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>The giant whisker race, the true dragon race, the Qilin race, and the Phoenix race formed a huge formation and started to fight.</p><p>It made the battle in the city of returning ruins even more intense.</p><p>“Two world city, send out the heavenly Emperor assassins!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor ordered.</p><p>“Yes!” Someone immediately spread the news.</p><p>Outside the two world city, the four-armed members of the evil god tribe disappeared in a flash. They mixed into the crowd of evil god tribe members and charged towards the heaven realm cultivators.</p><p>The speed of these short and small evil god race members was too fast. They were natural assassins, and their cultivation was at the heavenly Emperor realm. The moment they moved, the ancestral Dragon noticed them immediately.</p><p>send out heavenly Emperor powerhouses who are known for their speed to stop the evil god tribe’s assassin clan!</p><p>Zu long ordered.</p><p>The news immediately spread to the battlefield.</p><p>“It’s my turn, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Behind the two world city were the celestial thearchs of the heaven realm, and bubbles was among them.</p><p>At that moment, bubbles cried out excitedly and in a flash, she charged out.</p><p>The bubble’s speed was extremely fast. The moment it charged out, it was already on the battlefield.</p><p>Wherever she passed by, a terrifying spacetime power would envelop the bodies of some of the evil god tribe members. The bodies of these evil god tribe members would immediately age and shrivel up before finally turning into skeletons, as if they had been deprived of their time.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, Saber Light burst forth. A short, four-armed evil god Clansman slashed the four sharp blades in his hands toward bubbles with extreme speed.</p><p>Experts of the same level would not be able to keep up with the speed of the evil god race.</p><p>However, he ran into bubbles.</p><p>“I’ve already discovered you, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles pouted and dodged the opponent’s attack with a flash. Then, he suddenly appeared behind the opponent and with a wave of his hand, he plucked off the opponent’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
