Qing Cang, the Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, venerable sovereign rebellion, and the others also appeared.</p><p>They looked at the destructive scene in front of them and were deeply shocked. A battle between gods was too terrifying. They couldn’t get involved at all. They would probably be ground into dust by the aftermath.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>All the demigods muttered as they looked forward.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was surrounded by three figures.</p><p>One of them was the horned man, while the other was the giant python. It was as large as a mountain, and its eyes were cold as it stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, what made Lu Ming most concerned was the third one.</p><p>It was a bald burly man, but his bald head was covered with black runes, which looked extremely strange.</p><p>He was holding a saber that was bigger than a man. The last strike had been made by this man.</p><p>“Second level of the void God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>After receiving the other party’s attack, Lu Ming could tell that the bald man’s strength was far above that of the horned man and the giant python. It was very likely that he was a second-level void God-level existence.</p><p>the way of a ruler. I didn’t expect that someone in a small world could master the way of a ruler. If we use it to refine great medicine, young master will be very happy!</p><p>The bald man licked his lips. His eyes were extremely cold. He suddenly stepped forward and slashed his saber, which was taller than a man, at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also waved his sword and the two of them clashed again.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying explosion was heard. The saber radiance and sword Qi were wanton. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>“The second level void God Realm is indeed powerful. Senior ancestral Dragon is right!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>When he was a one-star heavenly Emperor, he was able to fight against a first level void God Realm expert. However, now that he had broken through to the two-star heavenly Emperor realm, he was unable to fight against a second level void God Realm expert.</p><p>That was because the difference between breaking through one level in the heavenly Emperor realm was not as big as breaking through one level in the void God Realm.</p><p>Unless he became a three-star heavenly Emperor, he wouldn’t be able to fight against a second level void God Realm expert.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After the bald man pushed Lu Ming back, he kept stepping forward. His divine power burst out and his saber kept slashing forward.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength. His entire body was enveloped by the power of the ruler. His combat sword trembled and he slashed out beams of sword light to fight against his opponent.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming kept casting the battle formula, hoping to trigger the double combat strength.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was more unlucky. He had already triggered it more than ten times but he still did not trigger the double combat strength.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After more than a dozen exchanges, Lu Ming was sent flying back more than a hundred thousand miles. Blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Heaven suppressing seal, watch me tear it apart!”</p><p>The bald burly man laughed heartily as a shocking Saber Light slashed towards the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this critical moment, Lu Ming finally triggered the double combat strength and his combat strength skyrocketed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and arrived in front of the bald man in an instant. He swung his sword.</p><p>The power of this sword was much stronger than the previous one. The bald man’s expression changed and he raised his saber to block it.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The bald burly man was sent flying by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and increased his speed to the maximum as he charged forward. However, he did not charge at the bald man, but at the onehorned man.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The one-horned burly man was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly explode and send the bald burly man flying with one move.</p><p>Initially, he thought that the bald burly man would be able to crush and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Instinctively, he raised the weapon in his hand to block it. However, when his weapon collided with Lu Ming’s combat sword, he felt an irresistible force surging towards him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The weapon in the one-horned man’s hand flew out, and his arm was directly blown apart. He screamed and spurted out blood as his body flew far away. How could Lu Ming miss this opportunity?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming dashed out and slashed out a second time.</p><p>“Save…”</p><p>The one-horned burly man shouted in horror. However, he had only managed to utter one word before he was split into two by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The one-horned man had fallen!</p><p>Fast, it was extremely fast!</p><p>From the moment Lu Ming made his move to the moment he killed the onehorned burly man, only an instant had passed.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the one-horned man, he did not stop at all and charged at the giant python.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The bald burly man was the first to react. He roared and charged at Lu Ming with a saber in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bald burly man slashed more than a hundred times in a row. Terrifying beams of light crushed the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming slashed horizontally, breaking through a hundred saber beams in a row. However, the giant python finally seized the opportunity and retreated at top speed. At the same time, its body shrank, turning into a huge snake that was a few meters long. Its eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>this person is evil. Let’s join forces to deal with him!</p><p>The bald burly man roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the giant python made its move. It opened its mouth and spat out a thin black sword that was like a small snake. It flew towards Lu Ming at a strange angle and at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about the Python’s attack. He charged straight at the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s purpose was very simple. He would eliminate the weak ones first and then deal with the strong ones.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Python’s eyes were cold. It retreated and controlled the snake-shaped sword to stab Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The snake-shaped thin sword was approaching Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>However, just as it was about to hit Lu Ming’s glabella, his eyes glowed with a purple-gold light.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s Dominator’s power erupted and acted on the snake-shaped sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The direction of the snake-shaped thin sword deviated and flew past Lu Ming’s ear. However, Lu Ming’s figure did not stop and he continued to charge at the Python.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The giant Python’s expression changed drastically, and it retreated frantically.</p><p>The bald man shouted angrily and chased after him.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying suction force came from above Lu Ming’s head and acted on his body, causing him to suddenly stop.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>A loud roar came from the sky, and a huge object suddenly appeared.</p><p>This person’s entire body was blood red. He had a wide mouth and sharp fangs.</p><p>He had a pair of blood-colored wings. He looked extremely similar to the human-shaped bat that Lu Ming had killed earlier. It was obvious that they were from the same race.</p><p>However, this humanoid bat creature’s cultivation was obviously stronger, no weaker than the bald man’s.</p><p>Its two wings were like a storm, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>another second level void God Realm existence!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed again.</p><p>How many experts had entered the yuanluo Palace? This was what Lu Ming was most uncertain about.</p><p>But now, they could only fight!</p><p>The combat sword in his hand trembled and shot out beams of sword light to fight against the blood-colored bat above his head.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming soared into the sky, becoming one with the sword.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
