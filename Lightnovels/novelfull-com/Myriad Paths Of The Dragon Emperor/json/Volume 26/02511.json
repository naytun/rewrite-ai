Lu Ming was confused.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a series of rumbling sounds came from the distance. The magma giant had appeared again.</p><p>“Brat, you’ve been hiding for so long and you finally dare to show yourself. Come and take my punch!”</p><p>Before the magma even reached him, he had already thrown out a punch.</p><p>A huge fist condensed from lava came crashing toward Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>If this had happened when Lu Ming had just arrived on the island, he would not have been able to withstand the punch and would have been injured.</p><p>But now?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and he threw a punch across the air.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the power of the way of domination in this punch. He only used his physical strength.</p><p>With a punch, the void was directly pierced through, revealing a pitch-black void. Endless void storms condensed into fist force and blasted toward the magma fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided with each other and the entire Island shook.</p><p>Then, they disappeared in pairs.</p><p>hahaha, kid, it seems like you’ve broken through. Come, come, play with me!</p><p>The magma giant laughed and rushed toward Lu Ming in big strides.</p><p>“Today, I’m going to give you a good beating!”</p><p>An ominous glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. His muscles and bones trembled. His body passed through space and appeared in front of the magma giant. He punched out with both fists.</p><p>The magma giant was also filled with a strong will to fight. It moved its body and threw magma fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle, and it was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>haha, not bad, kid. You can fight with me now. However, you’re still not strong enough to defeat me!</p><p>The magma giant grinned.</p><p>Then add a little more. I was just stretching my muscles and bones just now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He had indeed been stretching his muscles and bones just now.</p><p>His physical body had just made a breakthrough, and his power had skyrocketed. He needed to get used to it, so he didn’t use the power of the path of domination just now. He just relied on his physical strength.</p><p>Now, he had more or less adapted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body grew stronger. His entire body was shrouded in a layer of purple-gold light.</p><p>With the addition of the Dominator’s Dao, Lu Ming’s combat strength had undoubtedly increased by a notch. Although the increase was not particularly significant compared to his physical strength, it was enough to suppress the magma giant.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming started to attack again. The purple-gold fist radiance broke through the air and destroyed the magma giant’s attack in an instant, forcing it to retreat.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and punched the magma giant’s chest. The magma giant’s chest exploded, leaving a large hole that was transparent from the front and back.</p><p>However, the lava giant seemed to be made of lava, and it recovered in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Not bad, kid. You win!”</p><p>The magma giant shouted.</p><p>again! We’re not done yet. Continue!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to attack.</p><p>Lu Ming had been beaten up by the lava giant a few times previously and he was really angry. He would not be able to calm down if he did not return the favor.</p><p>“Nest, kid, I’ve already let you win, and you’re still fighting, ah….</p><p>The lava giant cried out and was punched in the face by Lu Ming.</p><p>Half of his face had exploded, but he recovered in an instant.</p><p>However, Lu Ming kicked the lava giant’s stomach again, sending it flying. Lu Ming took a step forward and chased after it, continuing to attack.</p><p>ah, ah, you’re shameless. You’re still attacking? stop it. Nest…</p><p>The lava giant kept screaming. However, its vitality was too tenacious. It was hit by Lu Ming’s continuous attacks as if nothing had happened. It could not be killed at all.</p><p>However, he still felt pain after being hit, so he kept screaming.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after he was hit dozens of times. At this time, the magma giant looked at Lu Ming with a resentful gaze.</p><p>It was like a young girl in her Prime had been humiliated by a thug.</p><p>“Petty and vengeful!”</p><p>The magma giant muttered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes.</p><p>“Nothing much? You’ve passed. Go to the next island!”</p><p>The magma giant turned around and ran, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>his current strength was finally at the peak of the heaven realm, the evil god Realm.</p><p>Without the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he could suppress a peak heavenly Emperor with his own strength.</p><p>In the current heaven realm and evil god Realm, other than the unrivaled powerhouses who were half a step into the martial God Realm, there were still true martial gods. He no longer had any opponents.</p><p>However, in the entire heaven realm and the evil god Realm, how many demigods and martial gods were there?</p><p>He had finally reached the realm and the existence that he had once looked up to through his hard work.</p><p>” What’s on the next island?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and came to the other end of the island. Indeed, he found a floating bridge that led to the next island.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He stepped onto the floating bridge and headed to the next island.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the next island.</p><p>This Island was completely different from the previous one. It was full of vitality, with green trees and a faint fragrance in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around the island and arrived at the center.</p><p>There was a huge mountain peak here, and at the foot of the mountain was a cliff.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened.</p><p>He discovered that there was a huge statue at the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>This statue was exactly the same as the statues that Lu Ming had seen in the other Cursed Lands.</p><p>However, it was many times larger.</p><p>Moreover, the statue was also filled with a domineering aura, and it was extremely strong. Even from a distance, Lu Ming could feel a strong Dominator’s aura spreading in all directions.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted upward and he noticed that there was a large word carved on the cliff above the statue.</p><p>The word “battle”!</p><p>Battle! Battle! Battle!</p><p>When Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the word ‘battle’, loud roars suddenly came from the word. They were filled with an endless fighting spirit.</p><p>It was as if an unrivaled expert was fighting a great battle.</p><p>The next moment, the voice disappeared. However, the word ‘battle’ began to distort in Lu Ming’s eyes. A mysterious concept emerged in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>It was as if the word ‘battle’ represented the source of all battle, combat power, and combat techniques. It was extremely profound and unfathomable.</p><p>how amazing! This is too amazing!</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming seemed to have a new understanding of the various combat skills and divine abilities that he had cultivated in the past.</p><p>“It’s not bad to be able to reach this Island!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from behind Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
