As long as the martial God did not appear, they would be invincible.</p><p>Such people were extremely rare. Each one of them was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>The primal Chaos Emperor, Hunyuan sect’s sect master, and undying Emperor were all such people.</p><p>There wouldn’t be too many in the entire heaven realm or the evil god Realm.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming had thought that this time around, people of such a level would not enter netherworld mountain. Instead, they would stay outside to guard against the enemy. He did not expect that the evil god tribe would bring people of such a level in. At this moment, they suddenly launched an attack and wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe member’s killing intent was cold, and his aura was as deep as the ocean. He took a few steps forward and charged toward Lu Ming, sending out a few terrifying palm prints.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He activated the power of the Divine Nine- Dragon Cauldron to the extreme.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Xie nianqing had also arrived. Endless black Lotus sword Qi gathered into three beams and slashed toward the evil god demigod.</p><p>The attacks from both sides collided, and a violent explosion occurred in the area.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook violently. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. His body flew out and he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>Fortunately, his life force was extremely tenacious. If it were anyone else, they would have been more seriously injured.</p><p>Xie nianqing was slightly better off than Lu Ming, but he also kept retreating, his face pale.</p><p>Even when the two of them joined forces, they were still no match for the other.</p><p>Demigods were too powerful. They were known to be invincible, and that wasn’t just for show.</p><p>Even two peak heavenly emperors wouldn’t be a match for a half-God.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The demigod of the evil god race looked at Xie nianqing in shock.</p><p>He did not expect that there would be such a young powerhouse in the heaven realm other than Lu Ming.</p><p>Such a character had never appeared in the evil god tribe since ancient times.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>The more talented he was, the more he had to be killed.</p><p>The demigod of the evil god race had his purple hair flying in the wind. His aura was at its peak as he glared at Lu Ming and charged toward him.</p><p>Compared to Xie nianqing, he wanted to kill Lu Ming more.</p><p>This was because the divine ancestor of the non-human race had ordered that Lu Ming must be eliminated if there was a chance.</p><p>A purple combat sword formed in his hand. The sword Qi shot up into the sky and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>as a half-God, you’re really shameless to deal with a junior. Your opponent is me!</p><p>die! a cold voice rang out, and countless bolts of lightning shot toward the demigod of the evil god race like thunder Dragons.</p><p>Every bolt of lightning gave off a heart-palpitating aura.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, he could feel a strong sense of danger.</p><p>The evil god race demigod’s expression changed as well. He turned his purple sword around and slashed out one shocking sword light after another, clashing with the lightning and sending out a terrifying force.</p><p>In the end, the sword Qi and the lightning both disappeared.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>One of them was a human, wearing a lightning armor with bolts of lightning dancing on it.</p><p>This person was tall and slender. He looked to be around 30 years old.</p><p>Of course, this was only on the surface. In reality, he might have lived for countless years.</p><p>“Tianlei, it’s you. I didn’t expect you to come in here!” He said.</p><p>The eyes of the evil god race’s demigod turned cold.</p><p>“Heavenly lightning? Could it be the heavenly Thunder Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>He had stayed in the heaven realm for so many years, so he had more or less heard of some of the top experts.</p><p>Supreme Emperor sky Thunder was also known as a Supreme Emperor. Without a doubt, he was an existence on par with the chaos Supreme Emperor and the undying Supreme Emperor.</p><p>A demigod and an unrivaled expert.</p><p>Furthermore, he had another identity, and that was the disciple of the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Who was the ancestor of technique?</p><p>He was a peerless expert who had created the nomological cultivation system at the end of the primordial era. He was a shockingly talented and rare peerless figure.</p><p>such a person was simply too amazing. With his own strength, he had created a law system and made it so strong that it surpassed many ancient cultivation systems.</p><p>However, the ancestor of technique suddenly disappeared at the end of the immemorial era. No one knew where he went.</p><p>Therefore, when the evil god tribe invaded the heaven realm in the ancient times, the ancestor of technique did not appear.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder Emperor was one of the ancestor of technique’s disciples, and his background was not to be underestimated.</p><p>“If you can come in, I can naturally come in as well. We haven’t fought for many years, so let’s fight again today!”</p><p>Heavenly Thunder Emperor was extremely powerful. His entire body was covered in lightning, and he turned into a bolt of lightning that charged toward the demigod of the evil god race. The two of them engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing attacked the other evil god races.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming suddenly realized that the area was covered in fog. Fog was constantly rising from the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and blasted it toward one of the evil god tribe members. He was about to hit the other party, but for some reason, he suddenly missed. The other party’s figure disappeared in an instant.</p><p>The other party didn’t have the time to retreat. It was as if the space between them had suddenly been pulled apart.</p><p>He wasn’t the only one. The others at the scene also noticed the abnormality because they had already calculated the distance when they attacked.</p><p>However, when they attacked, they realized that the distance between them and the enemy had increased in an instant.</p><p>At this moment, the fog was getting thicker and thicker, blocking his vision.</p><p>Their line of sight was constantly shortening.</p><p>Everyone stopped and didn’t make a move. They looked around in surprise.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly realized that the people who were further away from him were completely shrouded in fog. He could not see their figures at all.</p><p>“Gather!”</p><p>Zu long shouted and called the heaven realm people to gather.</p><p>“Assemble!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor also called out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The two sides charged toward the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>However, as they rushed out, they realized that the ancestral Dragon or the divine ancestor was getting further and further away from them. Then, they disappeared before their eyes.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over but he did not discover anything. The ancestor Dragon had disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and realized that even more people had disappeared. Long Chen, Huang Ling, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the others had all disappeared from Lu Ming’s sight.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, he was the closest to Lu Ming. At this moment, his figure was also fading.</p><p>“Little Qing…”</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>The two of them charged at each other, but it was very strange.</p><p>The two of them weren’t far from each other. In the past, they would have reached each other in a single step. However, no matter how hard they tried, they realized that their figures were getting fainter and fainter. Eventually, they completely disappeared from sight.</p><p>“Little Qing…”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed to the place where Xie nianqing had been standing. However, he did not find anything and did not hear any response.</p><p>Everyone disappeared just like that. Other than the thick fog, Lu Ming was the only one left in the world.</p><p>“There should be a large array here that separated everyone!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>This should be the most likely possibility.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
