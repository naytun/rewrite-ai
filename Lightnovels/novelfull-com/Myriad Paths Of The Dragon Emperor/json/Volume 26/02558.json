After a while, he said,” why did the evil G.o.d tribe and the foreign race’s divine ancestor attack the heaven realm and destroy us? it’s for … For that…</p><p>Zu long pointed at the golden seal and said. the heaven suppressing scal! Their goal is to tear the heaven suppressing seal apart!</p><p>“Heaven suppressing seal!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat. They knew that the seal was called the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>However, why did the evil G.o.d race have to tear the heaven suppressing seal apart?</p><p>if I want to know everything, I have to start from the structure of this world, or the universe!</p><p>people who cultivate laws can cultivate a small world after they enter the Martial Emperor realm. However, no matter how strong their cultivation is, these small worlds still have flaws!</p><p>as for the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm, they are naturally formed by heaven and earth, with perfect nomological laws and great. DAOS. They are ruled by the heavenly Dao. Such worlds allow people to cultivate continuously until they reach the half-G.o.d Realm. These worlds are called small chiliocosm!</p><p>Zu long paused for a moment as if he wanted to give everyone time to digest.</p><p>“A small world?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled and their imaginations ran wild!</p><p>Hearing the ancestral Dragon’s words, other than the evil G.o.d Realm, heaven realm, and primordial realm, could there be other worlds?</p><p>Some people with weaker cultivation had originally thought that the world was only so big, with only the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm. They had never thought that there were other worlds, and were naturally even more shocked at this time.</p><p>Everyone’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>“If there are small worlds, there will naturally be big worlds!”</p><p>the greater world is known as the primal universe. It is also known as the divine realm. That place is vast and boundless. I wonder how vast it is!</p><p>Zu long continued.</p><p>“As expected, the primal universe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. It was the second time he heard the term “primeval universe! Back then, Bai Ya had mentioned it on netherworld Island.</p><p>the primeval universe is too vast. A small chiliocosm is like a speck of dust compared to the primeval universe. The number of small chiliocosm attached to the primeval universe is beyond imagination. No one knows how many there are!</p><p>and our heaven realm, primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d tribe are a small chiliocosm!</p><p>Zu long continued to explain.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Most of the people at the scene were dumbfounded.</p><p>Zulong’s words had subverted their world view and their understanding.</p><p>The heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm added together was only a small chiliocosm. And there were countless small chiliocosm that were attached to the primeval universe.</p><p>This meant that there were countless worlds that were similar to the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm. Above them, there was a vast primal universe.</p><p>in the small chiliocosm, the highest cultivation can be reached is the demiG.o.d realm. If you want to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm, you can only do so by going to the desolate universe!</p><p>before ancient times, the heaven realm, primordial realm, evil G.o.d Realm, and the primeval universe were all connected. Therefore, before that era, many half-G.o.ds went to the primeval universe!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Then why is it that no one has gone out and no one has heard of it?”</p><p>Someone could not help but ask</p><p>I know you have your doubts. The heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d Realm can be considered as small chiliocosm. There is only one pa.s.sage that leads to the primeval universe. That pa.s.sage is there!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon pointed at the seal and continued,” the reason why we can’t go out now that, in ancient times, I joined hands with the prison suppression patriarch and used the heaven suppression scal to seal this pa.s.sage!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked, especially some demiG.o.ds. They couldn’t understand why ancestral Dragon and prison-guarding patriarch would work together to seal the pa.s.sage.</p><p>“AL”</p><p>At this moment, zu long sighed with a bitter face, in fact, many small chiliocosm are controlled by some big forces in the primeval universe. We are no exception. We are controlled by a powerful force in the primeval universe!</p><p>that force is called the yuan Luo Palace. It is made up of many races and is extremely powerful. Our world is their private property!</p><p>in the primal universe, the human race and the divine beasts and alien races are all very spiritual races. Therefore, the yuanluo Palace will come here every once in a while and choose a group of powerful Supreme talents to go out. Do you know why they chose these Supreme talents?”</p><p>not to nurture them, but to use them to refine medicine and pills for their cultivation!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s words shocked many people.</p><p>Their world was controlled by a force called the yuan Luo Palace in the primal universe, but the yuan Luo Palace used them to refine elixirs.</p><p>What’s the difference between this and raising animals and spiritual herbs?</p><p>that’s right. The yuanluo Palace has turned this small world into a farm and a herb garden. When needed. they will extract some of the superior ‘medicinal herbs’ to refine into medicine. All the humans and G.o.dly beasts are the ‘medicinal herbs’ that the yuanluo Palace raises!</p><p>Zulong said, his face turning uglier.</p><p>“How did this happen?</p><p>Most of the people, including Lu Ming, looked very upset.</p><p>They would never have thought that they were just medicinal herbs that were cultivated by others.</p><p>This was a great irony and also a great blow.</p><p>Zhenyu and I couldn’t stand it. Zhenyu had a fortuitous encounter and obtained the heaven suppressing seal. The two of us controlled the seal and sealed the pa.s.sage!</p><p>however, when we were sealing it, we were still discovered by the people of the yuanluo Palace. Some of the powerhouses of the yuanluo Palace shouted and asked the evil G.o.d tribe to destroy us and open the scal!</p><p>the evil G.o.d tribe isn’t of much use to the yuanluo Palace, and they rarely use them to refine elixirs. On the contrary, they’ve obtained many benefits from the palace. They naturally don’t want the pa.s.sage to be scaled, so the divine ancestor of the non-human race and the sacred ancestor bloodheart are determined to destroy us and open the seal!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>Everyone suddenly understood. They understood everything now!</p><p>They finally knew why the evil G.o.d race was so bent on attacking and destroying the heaven realm.</p><p>They wanted to open the scal and claim credit from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the prison-guarding patriarch couldn’t bear to see the humans and divine beasts</p><p>being enslaved by the yuan Luo Palace like this.</p><p>That was why there was the ancient battle!</p><p>originally, I didn’t want to say anything about this matter. If we defeat the evil G.o.d tribe, this matter can be resolved. However, if we lose, there’s no need to reveal this secret. Sigh!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed as well. He understood what the ancestral Dragon was thinking.</p><p>It was really hard to accept that they were just ‘medicinal herbs’ that were raised in captivity.</p><p>It was too demoralizing and sad. If he could choose not to say it, he would naturally choose not to. however, the divine ancestor of the non-human race tore a hole in the heaven suppressing seal with a desperate strike. As a result, the powerhouses of the yuanluo Palace outside will definitely find a way to enter. We won’t be able to escape the disaster. You should know the whole story, so I’m telling you everything today! Zulong said.</p><p>FF?</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
