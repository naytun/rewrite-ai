In particular, the magma giant’s annoying look made Lu Ming so angry that he gritted his teeth.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no choice but to reconsider the problem of cultivation.</p><p>no, it’s impossible to reach the peak of great emperor in fifty years without any outside help!</p><p>I might as well cultivate my physical body. There are flames everywhere and the temperature is shockingly high. If I keep burning my body, it’ll be better for me to temper myself. I might as well cultivate my physical body and have a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and decided to cultivate his physical body.</p><p>It was not just because of the environment. There was another reason. There was only one bottleneck in the cultivation of the physical body. Once this bottleneck was broken through, Lu Ming’s physical strength could reach the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was only a five star great emperor. He would have to face two bottlenecks before he could reach the peak great emperor realm.</p><p>It was easier to break through one bottleneck than two.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Lu Ming put aside the path of domination and began to cultivate his physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming removed the defense on the surface of his body and activated the seven Gods mysterious technique. Instantly, the temperature outside reached tens of thousands of degrees Celsius and enveloped Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>ChiChi Chi…</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a sizzling sound.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled. When his muscles trembled, the high temperature outside seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s body, helping him to temper his body.</p><p>After cultivating for a while, Lu Ming took out an Emperor’s medicine and refined its energy to aid his cultivation.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming stopped cultivating.</p><p>it’s effective. The speed of cultivation here is several times faster than other places, but I can’t break through in 50 years!</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows in deep thought.</p><p>In this place, with the help of the high temperature, it was indeed faster to cultivate the physical body than outside. However, it was not so fast that it was exaggerated. Lu Ming estimated that it would be difficult to cultivate to the later stage of the sixth stage within fifty years.</p><p>“Let’s go to that lava lake!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he thought of the lava lake.</p><p>There was a lava lake on the island, and the temperature was at least dozens of times higher than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to cultivate with the help of the lava lake.</p><p>This was a cruel and extreme method. However, Lu Ming had no other choice now.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming dashed towards the lava lake.</p><p>When he arrived at the lava lake, waves of terrifying heat surged toward Lu Ming. The temperature was ten times higher than other places.</p><p>He was only standing on the side, but the temperature here was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to channel his energy to resist.</p><p>“Let’s get used to the surroundings first!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to dive into the lava lake. The temperature down there was too high. It was far from what ordinary lava could compare to. It was too terrifying. If Lu Ming were to jump down directly, he would probably be melted by the strength of his body.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming stood by the lava lake, put down his defense, and began to cultivate.</p><p>As soon as he removed his defense, a terrifyingly high temperature enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body, as if his body was about to burn.</p><p>ChiChi Chi…</p><p>Green smoke rose from Lu Ming’s body and he felt a tearing pain all over his body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even frown. This bit of pain was nothing to him.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming felt that cultivating here would be more effective.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy. Then, he calmed his breath and focused on cultivating.</p><p>Time flew by, and three years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming had already fully adapted to the high temperature of the lava lake.</p><p>In the past three years, the lava giant did not come to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming opened his eyes and leaped into the lava.</p><p>Three years of adaptation was enough. Now, he wanted to use the magma to temper his body.</p><p>It had been more than four years since he came to this Island. Time passed quickly, and 50 years would pass in the blink of an eye. He had to seize the time.</p><p>After jumping into the lava, Lu Ming sank into it and the terrifying lava enveloped him.</p><p>It hurt!</p><p>It was extremely painful!</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that his skin was beginning to melt. Following that, his muscles were also beginning to melt.</p><p>“Blockit!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to recover rapidly while at the same time, he circulated the seven Gods mysterious technique to use the high temperature to temper his body.</p><p>In the end, it was still blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although he was not in pain all the time, the effect of cultivating here was indeed much greater.</p><p>This was an extremely extreme cultivation method. Ordinary people would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>This was because the physical body was constantly in the process of melting and healing, back and forth. How many people could withstand such pain?</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming focused on cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, more than twenty years had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been on this Island for almost thirty years.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s physical body still had not broken through. It was still at the middle of the sixth stage.</p><p>not enough. Continue going down!</p><p>Lu Ming started to sink. The deeper he went, the higher the temperature of the lava lake would be.</p><p>After descending a few hundred meters, the temperature here was several times higher than above.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate.</p><p>Not far away, the magma giant was watching.</p><p>this kid is determined and decisive. He’s ruthless to himself. Not bad, not bad!</p><p>The magma giant murmured. Then, he turned around and left.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate, completely forgetting the time.</p><p>Every once in a while, he would sink down for a while. In the end, he had almost reached the bottom of the lava lake.</p><p>“Break through!”</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming let out a low growl. His muscles and bones trembled violently, giving off a thunderous explosion. There were also the roars of Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The lava around them exploded continuously, and the bottom of the lava lake seemed to have a giant wild beast rolling.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the lava exploded, and a figure rushed out of the lava lake!</p><p>This figure exuded a shocking aura!</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming. At this moment, his muscles were trembling and the qi and blood in his meridians were surging like an angry dragon. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>His physical body had finally made a breakthrough and reached the late stage of the sixth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>At this level, the strength of the body was equivalent to a peak heavenly Emperor. It was almost cultivated to the peak.</p><p>After a long while, the aura on Lu Ming’s body was concealed.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and a piece of clothing appeared on his body.</p><p>His clothes had long been burnt in the lava lake.</p><p>after 46 years, I’ve finally broken through!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and his lips curled into a smile.</p><p>It had been forty-six years since he came to this Island. In these forty-six years, Lu Ming did not rely on any rare treasures. He relied purely on his own perseverance to break through the bottleneck and push his physical body to the peak.</p><p>46 years old. If those old guys from the immemorial body cultivators knew that he had cultivated his physical body to this level, they would probably be dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
