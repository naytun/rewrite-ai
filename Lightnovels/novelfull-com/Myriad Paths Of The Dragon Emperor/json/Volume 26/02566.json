I’ll look around and see if there are any experts from the yuanluo Palace”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the ancestral Dragon and closed his cyes.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming dominated this world. Therefore, he could sense it anywhere in the heaven realm, the heaven realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm. He could even sense it in the dark void.</p><p>“Mm, there’s indeed one more person!”</p><p>In a dark s.p.a.ce, Lu Ming sensed a powerful existence. It should be at second-level void G.o.d-level and was sitting cross-legged in the void to recuperate.</p><p>Suddenly, this person opened his eyes, revealed a trace of shock, and turned to run.</p><p>“Can you run away?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He gathered the energy of the entire world, formed a combat sword, and slashed down. “Ah!”</p><p>The man let out a blood-curdling screech as he was killed.</p><p>A second-level void G.o.d Realm existence could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current state was too powerful. He could dominate the entire world and mobilize the energy of the entire world. He was comparable to a fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse, Killing a second-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to look around. However, he did not find any traces of other experts.</p><p>All the experts from the yuanluo Palace who had entered this place had been killed.</p><p>At this moment, the aura on Lu Ming’s body finally calmed down and returned to normal.</p><p>His injuries had also completely recovered.</p><p>“La Ming, did you just mobilize the energy of the entire heaven and earth?”</p><p>Zu long looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then waved his hand and kept the storage rings left behind by the experts he had killed. “Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing flew over with a face full of concern.</p><p>Then, dandan and the others also flew over.</p><p>I’m fine, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After everyone chatted for a while, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle and the others also left.</p><p>Not long after, the news of Lu Ming killing the G.o.ds in succession spread,</p><p>After countless people found out, they were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed many G.o.ds by himself.</p><p>That was a G.o.d. It was like a legend. Lu Ming’s prestige in the hearts of everyone in the heaven realm had reached the peak, even surpa.s.sing the ancestor Dragon by a large margin.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming was simply a G.o.d among G.o.ds.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and zu Long’s faces were grave.</p><p>In the area of the heaven suppressing seal, the ancestral Dragon and La Ming were discussing something this can’t go on. If the yuan Luo Palace knows that they have failed, they will definitely send out stronger existences!</p><p>Zu long frowned.</p><p>“Senior, what should we do now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>a small chiliocosm is a huge fortune to the yuan Luo Palace. Under normal circ.u.mstances, they would not be willing to destroy it, but there is no guarantee that they would not do so in a fit of anger. If they send out existences above the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm, they can completely destroy the heaven realm, the yuan realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Zu long frowned and thought. After a while, he said, “There’s only one way to survive!” “Senior, please speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that is to take the initiative to attack. Now, the people from the yuan Luo Palace don’t know that the people they sent in have been completely annihilated. They must be waiting for good news. Therefore, the forces outside the heaven suppressing scal shouldn’t be too strong!</p><p>now, if we take the initiative to attack, tear the heaven suppressing scal, and rush out, we might have a chance of success!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He pondered for a moment and said, “Alright, then we’ll move out!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a decisive person. If he continued to stay here, he could only sit and wait for his death, He would not stand a chance. However, if he rushed out, there was still a chance of survival.</p><p>however, there’s an important problem when you rush out. It’s the problem of your small world! Zulong said.</p><p>“The problem of the small world?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>If they were to charge out, they would definitely take most of the living beings into the small world and bring them out.</p><p>the primeval universe is a truly ancient and perfect world. It’s a real greater world. Such a world and a small world created through cultivation can’t coexist with it!</p><p>therefore, once you enter the primeval universe, within a year, the small world will separate from your body and merge with the primeval universe, becoming a part of it!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“What? A small world can actually merge with the primeval universe?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Wouldn’t his cultivation level drop drastically?</p><p>however, you don’t have to worry about one thing. The primeval universe is fair. When your small world fuses with it, it will also give you an equal amount of energy. Therefore, your cultivation state will not decline!</p><p>however, all the living beings you bring out will be exposed. Our traces will be exposed as well. So, once we leave, we must find a safe place to settle everyone within a year.</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“So that’s how it is. Only a year?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>In other words, after they leave, they must be out of danger within a year. Otherwise, it might be even more</p><p>dangerous.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can decide on this matter!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a determined look in his eyes.</p><p>Rather than waiting for death, it was better to fight to the death.</p><p>Zu Long’s eyes were filled with admiration. There weren’t many people who could be so decisive. alright, since we’ve decided to charge out, we’ll have t do it as soon as possible. Otherwise, the other party will react and gather more experts!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Then, the two of them discussed and decided to split up. They were going to gather most of the living beings</p><p>in the heaven realm.</p><p>Fortunately, many of the heaven realm’s humans cultivated the nomological system and had opened up small worlds that could accommodate a large number of living beings.</p><p>Lu Ming first. returned to the Dragon sovereign peak and told everyone about his plan. Everyone agreed to it.</p><p>Then, they dispersed and spread the news.</p><p>The entire heavenly realm began to move.</p><p>Most of them were willing to risk their lives after hearing this plan, because staying here would only lead to</p><p>death.</p><p>Some of the people in the pocket. dimension kept the people and divine beasts around them into their pocket. dimension and rushed to the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>In just ten days, almost all the places in the heaven realm were emptied. Many ordinary people were also taken into the small worlds.</p><p>Then, everyone gathered the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kept everyone into his small world.</p><p>In this way, most of the living creatures in the entire heaven realm were kept into the small world by Lu</p><p>Ming.</p><p>The heaven realm suddenly became empty.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and zu long were left under the heaven suppressing sigil.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s start!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The two of them began to work on tearing the heaven suppressing sigil.</p><p>If they attacked from within the heaven realm, they could easily tear down the heaven suppressing sigil, especially since Lu Ming could dominate the power of this world.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Not long after, the heaven suppressing seal was finally torn apart by the two of them, revealing a pitch-black Lunnel.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
