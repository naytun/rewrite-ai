It was extremely st.u.r.dy and immortal. Whether it was in terms of defense or strength, it was extremely terrifying. It surpa.s.sed other creatures of the same level.</p><p>This giant ape had a cultivation base of second level void G.o.d Realm. However, its ability was so powerful surpa.s.sed the other second level void G.o.d Realm powerhouses that. Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>that</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant ape retreated and let out a furious roar before charging at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his divine weapon sword and charged at the giant ape.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword kept clashing with the silver giant ape. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves. Sparks flew everywhere where they collided.</p><p>In the end, the giant silver ape was not. Lu Ming’s match. Even if Lu Ming did not activate the double combat. strength of the battle formula, he could still suppress the giant silver ape with the additional combat strength of the battle formula, the cultivation base of a three-star celestial Thearch, and his physical strength. The giant silver ape kept retreating!</p><p>Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er did not make a move. They formed an encirclement and stood at the side to be on guard, afraid that other strong pract.i.tioners or desolate beasts would attack them,</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the silver giant ape exchanged dozens of moves in a row. Finally, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and cut off the ape’s head.</p><p>IIu…</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. This silver giant ape was really hard to kill.</p><p>fortunately, this silver ape doesn’t have much intelligence. Otherwise, it would be even more difficult to deal</p><p>with!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>it’s said that there are intelligent metal life forms in the primeval universe. They’re an extremely powerful race and are ranked among the top among the countless races in the primeval universe!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“There really is a metallic lifeform with intelligence!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming broke open the chest of the giant silver ape and took out a round piece of metal.</p><p>This was the giant silver apc’s beast core.</p><p>A second-level void G.o.d Realm metal beast core could be sold for ten divine crystals.</p><p>An ordinary first-level virtual G.o.d-level metal beast core was worth five divine crystals, a second-level virtual G.o.d-level one was worth ten divine crystals, and a third-level virtual G.o.d-level one was worth twenty divine crystals.</p><p>As the beast core’s grade increased, its value also continued to double.</p><p>As long as he could kill 100 second level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts, he would be able to get back the rent of the starry sky battleship. The rest would be his profit.</p><p>let’s gather the beast cores first. We’ll split them equally!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>“Alright!’</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er nodded.</p><p>Then, everyone continued to move forward.</p><p>Not long after they left, two figures flashed and two middle-aged men appeared in the air.</p><p>it’s Tong Xi ‘cr, the heaven’s pride of the zhengtian Army, Tong Xi’ cr!</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t expect Tong Xi ‘er to dare to come here, and there are two other girls. Be more serious!</p><p>“Let’s go back and report to His Excellency. Ask him to send experts to capture these people and play with them for a while before killing them!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a flash, the two middle-aged men disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group continued to move forward. After a while, they encountered a first-tier virtual G.o.d-level metal desolate beast, which was easily killed by Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that Tong Xi ‘er’s cultivation had reached the peak of first level void G.o.d Realm and was not far from the second level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Moreover, her battle prowess was extremely shocking, far surpa.s.sing experts of the same level.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was a two-star heavenly Emperor, he had activated the battle character formula to double his combat power, but he had only managed to tie with Tong Xi er. Now, Lu Ming knew that the divine power long Xi’ er controlled was King-grade divine power. She was a genius.</p><p>Roar! ‘Roar!”</p><p>As they went deeper into the forest, they encountered more and more metallic desolate beasts. However, most of them were at the first or second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>As long as there weren’t many of them, they would be easily dealt with.</p><p>Not long after, they had already killed 15 first-level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts and five second-level virtual G.o.d-level metal wild beasts.</p><p>Thump! “ROOM!”</p><p>Suddenly, the ground trembled, and a few giant wolves with bodics as black as ink ran out from a Canyon in front of them.</p><p>This giant Wolf’s entire body seemed to be made of black iron. It was ten meters tall and twenty meters long, and it emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>not good! There are two third level void G.o.d Realm existences!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>There were a total of four giant wolves. Two of them were at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm, and the other two were at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>let’s quickly retreat and rush out!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er shouted.</p><p>If there was only one at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm, they could still fight it out if they joined forces. However, there were two at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm and two at the second level of the void G.o.d</p><p>Realm. They were in danger.</p><p>“No need, it’s a good time to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>He hadn’t used his full strength yet. Moreover, he was very clear about. Xie nianqing’s combat strength. II. was no problem for him to deal with a third level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>In addition, Xie nianjun’s strength was definitely not weaker than Xie nianqings.</p><p>“A battle? Lu Ming, don’t tell me you have a breakthrough!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was stunned.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Alright then, Let’s Have a Battle!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er gritted her teeth and said.</p><p>Back then, before Lu Ming had broken through, his combat strength was already on par with hers. Now that he had broken through, it should not be a problem for him to deal with a third-level virtual G.o.d-level giant.</p><p>wolf.</p><p>If she used all her strength to tie down a giant wolf, she might be able to fight it.</p><p>However, as soon as she finished speaking, Xie nianjun dashed out toward a third-tier virtual G.o.d-level Wolf.</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s expression changed. She felt that Xie nianjun was too impulsive. Xie nianjun’s cultivation was only at first-level ethereal G.o.d Realm, No matter how strong he was, he was at most about the same level as</p><p>her. It was too dangerous to rush out like this.</p><p>However, before she could stop him, Xie nianjun had already made his move.</p><p>Holy light emanated from her body as she clenched her fist in the air. A holy Sword of Light formed and then</p><p>slashed down.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A third-tier virtual G.o.d-level giant wolf howled and pounced at Xic nianjun. Its giant claws swiped down, creating a terrifying Hurricane.</p><p>However, when Xie nianjun’s sword-light collided with the huge wave’s claw, the result was unexpected.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The giant woll wailed and retreated. A deep sword mark appeared on its metal claw, almost cutting off its</p><p>entire claw,</p><p>“So strong?</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was dumbfounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie nianjun gained the upper hand one move. He moved and attacked the wolf again. His sword glowed and he slashed out a dozen times in an instant. Each strike was faster and stronger than the last. The woll was forced to retreat and its metal body was left with deep sword marks.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The other three wolves roared and pounced on Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianqing moved his body and charged towards another third level void G.o.d Realm giant wolf. He waved</p><p>his palm and forced the giant woll to retreat.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His body flashed and he charged out, killing the two second-level void G.o.d-level giant</p><p>wolves.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er seemed to wake up from a dream and also charged out.</p><p>Xie nianjun and Xie nianging’s combat strength completely suppressed the giant wolves at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm. They killed the two giant wolves in just a few moves.</p><p>ind</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
