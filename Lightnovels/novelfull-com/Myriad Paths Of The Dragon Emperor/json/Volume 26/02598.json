He frowned slightly.</p><p>He did buy some divine artifact fragments, but not in large quant.i.ties, only equivalent to about ten divine artifacts. They were all low-level divine artifact fragments, and he had spent 200 divine crystals.</p><p>these fragments of divine artifacts are not enough. Where should I buy them? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, a crisp voice rang out. Lu Ming looked up and saw Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you here to buy treasures?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er flew over with a smile.</p><p>yes, but I’m here to buy some fragments of divine artifacts. However, there are too few fragments here!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>purchase divine artifact fragments? ”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s gaze flickered, and she immediately thought of that metal ball.</p><p>after all, the righteous Army isn’t big, and they lack powerful refining materials. Therefore, they don’t have many divine artifact fragments in storage. Even if many people have divine artifact fragments, they won’t sell them here!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er explained.</p><p>“Oh, Miss Xi ‘er, then where can i buy a large number of divine artifact fragments?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>if you want to buy a large number of divine artifact fragments, you can only go to cloud Peak City!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“Yunfeng city? you mean the Yunfeng city where the Yunfeng Pavilion is located?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The chaotic astral River has an extremely vast territory. It has many life planets. In addition, there are also many planets without any life. There are countless large and small planets in total.</p><p>Therefore, there were many forces, big and small. For example, there were at least 800 forces like the righteous heaven Army and the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>However, among all the powers in the chaotic astral River, the most powerful one is undoubtedly the Yunfeng Pavilion.</p><p>That was because the Yunfeng Pavilion had a heavenly G.o.d.</p><p>Out of all the powers in the chaotic astral River, only the Yunfeng Pavilion has a heavenly deity. Without a doubt, it is the number one power.</p><p>Yunfeng city, where the Yunfeng Pavilion is located, is the most prosperous place in the chaotic astral River. Here, you can buy many things you want to buy.</p><p>that’s right. I’m also going to Cloud Peak City to buy some pills and prepare to break through to the next realm. We can go together!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He also wanted to go to Yunfeng city to sell a weapon that he could use.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been using the divine combat sword that Bai Ya had given him. However, after using it for a long time, Lu Ming felt that the spear was more suitable for him.</p><p>Although he had cultivated the ” battle ” formula and could use any weapon with ease, Lu Ming had just started cultivating and he had already started using a spear. He was used to using a spear.</p><p>Moreover, Bai Ya’s divine combat sword was only a level three low-grade divine weapon. It was still a little too low. Lu Ming wanted to buy a spear of a higher level.</p><p>He had asked around in the righteous Army, but he couldn’t find a suitable one.</p><p>The two of them stepped into the zhengtian Army’s teleportation formation and headed toward Yunfeng city.</p><p>True sky Star was very far away from Cloud Peak star, where Cloud Peak City was located. To cross the boundless starry sky, even if one took a teleportation array, it was impossible to reach it in one go. Instead, one would need to teleport multiple times.</p><p>Furthermore, it was such a long s.p.a.ce teleportation. Even if they took the teleportation array, it would still take a long time. After three days of continuous teleportation, they finally arrived at Yunfeng city.</p><p>“What a majestic city!”</p><p>Walking around the streets of Yunfeng city, Lu Ming could not help but sigh.</p><p>Only after coming to the primeval universe did Lu Ming feel that the heaven realm and the primordial realm were too small.</p><p>The surface area of the dark underworld star was equivalent to the sum of tens of thousands of heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d realms.</p><p>The true heavenstar was several times larger than the dark underworld star.</p><p>However, the cloud Peak planet, where Cloud Peak City was located, was at least dozens of times larger than the true sky planet.</p><p>Compared to planet Yunfeng, the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm were simply dust.</p><p>Just the area of Yunfeng city alone was estimated to be equivalent to the total area of hundreds of heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil G.o.d realms combined. One could imagine how huge it was.</p><p>Cloud Peak City was extremely lively. All the powers of the chaotic astral River, big and small, could come here.</p><p>Chaotic astral River is extremely chaotic. Killing can be seen everywhere, but Cloud Peak City is an exception.</p><p>The Yunfeng Pavilion had a rule. Yunfeng city was a place for business, and killing was not allowed. If one wanted to kill, they had to go to a specific fighting stage. Whoever violated the rule would be hunted down by the Yunfeng Pavilion.</p><p>As such, Cloud Peak City was extremely safe. This was the only way to attract countless people to do business, trade, buy treasures, or sell treasures.</p><p>If it wasn’t safe, they could kill him and steal his treasures at any time. Who would dare to come?</p><p>Therefore, the two of them were more at ease and walked around casually.</p><p>Two days later, the two of them arrived at the largest city square in Yunfeng city.</p><p>There was a sea of people here, and there were all kinds of shops.</p><p>There were all kinds of materials, elixirs, weapons, and treasures.</p><p>There were even divine skills for sale.</p><p>Lu Ming went in to take a look. The price was shockingly high.</p><p>Lu Ming could not afford even the lowest grade level one divine skill. It would cost at least tens of thousands of divine crystals.</p><p>At a divine elixir store, Tong Xi ‘er bought the divine elixirs she needed. She had already acc.u.mulated enough, and when she returned, she could break through to the second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Then, they came to a shop that sold artifacts.</p><p>“Dear Customer, may I know what you need?”</p><p>Immediately, a beautiful young lady came up to him.</p><p>h.e.l.lo, I need to buy a spear-type artifact!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“A spear-type divine weapon? What level do you need? I can recommend it to you!”</p><p>The young woman said with a smile.</p><p>“A level five low grade G.o.d equipment or above!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, please follow me!”</p><p>The young woman brought Lu Ming to a room. There were all kinds of long Spears and divine artifacts hanging in the room.</p><p>“This is a level five low grade G.o.d artifact, Hurricane spear. It’s worth three thousand G.o.d crystals!”</p><p>“This is a low grade level six G.o.d artifact, the raging flames spear. It’s priced at seven thousand G.o.d crystals!”</p><p>……</p><p>The lady introduced them to Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>“What an expensive price!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>&Nbsp; a level five low quality G.o.d artifact cost three thousand G.o.d crystals.</p><p>Low-grade divine weapons corresponded to ethereal G.o.d Realm. Usually, ethereal G.o.d Realm Warriors would use low-grade divine weapons while true G.o.d Realm Warriors would use middle-grade divine weapons.</p><p>&Nbsp; and so on, the divine kings used Supreme-quality divine artifacts.</p><p>One had to know that on the myriad Gold Star, a fifth-level void G.o.d Realm beast core was only worth 80 divine crystals.</p><p>&Nbsp; a low level five G.o.d artifact spear, on the other hand, would cost three thousand G.o.d crystals.</p><p>Of course, refining a divine weapon required more than one type of material. It required the combination of many materials and the cost of the refining.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming chose a spear that was a level six low-grade divine artifact, the meteor spear, and spent seven thousand divine crystals on it.</p><p>“There aren’t enough divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Previously, when he broke through to the four-star heavenly Emperor realm, he had used about 5000 divine crystals. Now, he had spent another 7000 divine crystals.</p><p>Now, he only had twenty-eight thousand divine crystals left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
