He appeared in front of the evil god tribe’s military camp and swept out with his long spear.</p><p>It was as if the spear was sweeping through thousands of soldiers. The camp that was not hit just now was constantly blown to pieces by the spear.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>Countless members of the evil god tribe turned into countless streaks of light and fled toward the back of the military camp.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>a few angry roars came from the depths of the evil god race’s camp.</p><p>A few terrifying auras rose up and rushed over.</p><p>peak heavenly Emperor! It’s a peak heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Many of the heaven realm beings ‘expressions changed drastically, and they subconsciously tried to escape.</p><p>quick, send a message to two world city and Ask the Experts to come over. The other party has three peak heavenly emperors!</p><p>Some people had already started to transmit their voices.</p><p>“Three peak heavenly emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The speed of a peak heavenly Emperor was too fast. He appeared in front of Lu Ming in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“There’s another acquaintance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>One of them was mo Luojia, known as the realm-breaking general. Back then, mo Luojia was the one who had captured Lu Ming and brought him to the evil god Realm.</p><p>As for the other two, one of them was a royal member of the evil god tribe, while the other was a noble member of the evil god tribe. Their bodies were covered in sparkling purple scales.</p><p>The three peak heavenly emperors ‘eyes were filled with terrifying killing intent. They wished they could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Behind them, the heaven realm’s creatures felt a terrifying pressure. Many of them had already retreated. Some of them were bold. Seeing that Lu Ming did not move, they forced themselves to be brave and watched.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed so many of my people. Today, you’ll die without a doubt!”</p><p>Said moruojia coldly.</p><p>make your move, mo Luojia. Today, it’s a good time to settle the score of you capturing me back then. However, I advise you to make your move together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>how arrogant! I alone am enough to kill you!</p><p>die! moruojia shouted coldly. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming. His purple hair danced in the wind and his aura was raised to its maximum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A combat sword appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword slashed out, and the void was cut apart, leaving a crack that was a million miles long.</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor’ s full-power attack was unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Without a doubt, the sword in moruojia’s hand was a heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hand shook and swept out, clashing with mo Luojia’s combat sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a deafening boom, mo Luojia’s body trembled violently. He was sent flying back tens of thousands of miles. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>” How is that possible?”</p><p>Moroja roared in his heart. He was so shocked that it was hard to imagine.</p><p>The two of them had only exchanged one move and he was already injured by Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had not even used the heaven Dao soldier, but he had already used it.</p><p>He simply couldn’t accept it!</p><p>Back then, he could kill Lu Ming with a flip of his hand. However, he could actually injure him now. It had only been a few hundred years.</p><p>A few hundred years, to people of their level, was just a blink of an eye.</p><p>He was not the only one. The other two peak heavenly emperors of the evil god race and the other members of the evil god race were all stunned.</p><p>The living beings of the heaven realm were also stunned.</p><p>he injured a peak heavenly Emperor with one move. Is this Lu Ming’s strength?</p><p>“This is too terrifying!”</p><p>Even some of the heaven realm beings that were running away stopped in their tracks.</p><p>“I said, you can’t do it alone. Come at me three times!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. The purple-gold spear in his hand dispersed and was replaced by the great desolation spear.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Mo Luojia looked at the other two peak heavenly emperors.</p><p>“Good! Let’s attack together! We must kill this man today!”</p><p>The other peak-stage heavenly Emperor from the evil god tribe nodded and transmitted a message to the other two.</p><p>Lu Ming was really terrifying. He had such combat strength at such a young age.</p><p>They had also heard of Lu Ming’s performance in netherworld mountain.</p><p>The evil god tribe members who had been to netherworld mountain said that Lu Ming had the combat strength of a peak heavenly Emperor when he controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not do anything just now. He had injured moroja with his own strength.</p><p>This was a little terrifying!</p><p>This proved that Lu Ming’s ability was increasing rapidly.</p><p>If such a person was not killed, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three peak heavenly emperors moved instantly and attacked Lu Ming from three directions.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He shook his great desolation spear and thrust it out three times. Three spearlights were aimed at the three of them.</p><p>There were three consecutive booms. The attacks of moroja and the other two were all destroyed by Lu Ming. They were even forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward with an imposing manner. His long spear trembled, and the Spear’s radiance that soared to the sky attacked the three of them continuously, enveloping them in the Spear’s radiance.</p><p>The three of them unleashed their full power and fought Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they were shocked to discover that they were not Lu Ming’s match at all. They were completely suppressed and at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to win!”</p><p>After the shock, the beings of the heaven realm were overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming could suppress three peak heavenly emperors alone. What kind of combat strength was that?</p><p>An invincible expert!</p><p>A word flashed across everyone’s mind!</p><p>Only an unrivaled powerhouse would have such combat strength to suppress three peak heavenly emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually reached the stage of being an invincible powerhouse.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the intense battle, moroja was whipped by Lu Ming’s long spear. His body almost exploded. He retreated frantically and kept vomiting blood.</p><p>“Morajia, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming had already appeared in front of moroja and thrust the great desolation spear.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Moruojia was terrified. He burst out madly, setting up attacks and defenses.</p><p>However, under Lu Ming’s attack, it was all in vain. They all collapsed and exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current physical combat strength was equivalent to that of a peak heavenly Emperor. The combat strength of the way of the ruler was also equivalent to that of a peak heavenly Emperor. With the two combined, Lu Ming’s strength was far beyond that of a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had comprehended the battle character formula.</p><p>With the enhancement of the battle formula, Lu Ming’s combat strength was even stronger. He could easily suppress a peak-stage heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The great desolation spear broke through mo Luojia’s attack like a piece of rotten wood. It pierced through his dantian.</p><p>Moroja’s eyes were wide open as he looked at Lu Ming in shock. There was fear in his eyes.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He shook the long spear and a terrifying power burst out. Mo Luojia’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor had fallen!</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>The other two peak heavenly emperors turned around and left, not daring to continue fighting.</p><p>They immediately tore open space, wanting to escape through space.</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor had the ability to tear space and travel from one realm to another.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out the great desolation spear in his hand and the space exploded, blocking the other party’s path.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged toward the two peak heavenly emperors.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
