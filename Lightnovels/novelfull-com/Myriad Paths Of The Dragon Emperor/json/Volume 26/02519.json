I wasn’t far from the demigod realm in ancient times. If you give me another fruit of life, I’ll definitely be able to break through to the demigod realm!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll give you another one!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and another Jade box flew to dandan.</p><p>Dandan took a look and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. She looked at Lu Ming with even more fervour in her eyes.</p><p>“Quickly get lost, there’s nothing else!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>In the end, dandan left the place reluctantly.</p><p>After dandan left, Lu Ming found Xie nianqing and gave him two fruits of life.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation base was at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Although Xie nianqing wasn’t injured, he could use the two fruits of life to unleash his potential and help him break through to demigod-level.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming called bubbles over. Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others each gave one.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the others ‘cultivation was not very high yet. After consuming a life fruit, they would definitely transform and have endless potential. In the future, their cultivation path would definitely be smooth and their improvement would be rapid.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to the yuan continent and gave his parents and Qiu Yue a fruit of life each.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s help, Lu Ming’s parents had initially refined the fruit of life. Their cultivation had skyrocketed and they broke through all the barriers. In just a month, they had broken through to the martial sage realm.</p><p>The fruit of life was simply too heaven-defying. Even the martial God was greatly affected by it, so its medicinal effects could be seen.</p><p>Using it on a Martial Emperor was simply a waste of God’s gift. However, Lu Ming did not care.</p><p>Moreover, it was impossible for martial emperors and martial Saints to refine the fruit of life. If they ate it, their bodies would probably explode from the medicinal power.</p><p>However, with the help of Lu Ming’s path of domination, there was no problem.</p><p>Lu Ming was only satisfied when Li Ping and Lu Yuntian broke through to the martial sage realm and their lifespans reached more than one hundred thousand years.</p><p>Furthermore, the life fruit’s medicinal effects were too heaven-defying. They were still far from refining it. In the days to come, their cultivation would definitely skyrocket.</p><p>with the help of the life fruit, their comprehension of the laws was shockingly fast.</p><p>Given time, breaking through to the martial Supreme realm would be a piece of cake.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, Lu Xiangxiang, and the rest, their cultivation would also improve by leaps and bounds in the coming days.</p><p>After one round, Lu Ming had consumed fifteen fruits of life.</p><p>After settling these matters, Lu Ming calmed down and thought about his next cultivation path.</p><p>He had two options.</p><p>One was to cultivate the seven Gods mysterious technique and break through the physical body.</p><p>He had already cultivated his physical body to the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. His next step would be to start breaking through to the martial God Realm.</p><p>However, the seventh level of the seven Gods mysterious technique only had four words: 10,000 Yuan in one.</p><p>This made him scratch his head and have no clue.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming decided to put his physical body down and cultivate the path of domination.</p><p>He was only at the peak Emperor realm on the ruler’s Dao. He still had a long way to go before he could break through to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Furthermore, Jing Yu’s painting was a reference to the Dao of a sovereign, making it much easier to cultivate.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Lu Ming began to focus on comprehending the path of the ruler.</p><p>Now that he was a peak Emperor, his next step would be to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming focused on cultivation. In the blink of an eye, a few months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped cultivating and a look of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p>when he was cultivating the path of a God, he felt like there was a powerful energy in the world that was preventing him from breaking through.</p><p>That power seemed to be the power of this world, the power of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why is the power of this world trying to stop me?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly and could not understand.</p><p>He started to feel a little anxious.</p><p>He did not have much time left.</p><p>Now that the non-human sacred ancestor had returned with eleven fruits of life, he and sacred ancestor bloodheart would definitely consume them to recover their cultivation. Once they recovered, a shocking battle would break out between the two sides.</p><p>The final battle was about to begin.</p><p>Lu Ming had to make a breakthrough in his cultivation before that.</p><p>He had to make a breakthrough in both his physical body and his Dao of domination. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be a match for the non-human divine ancestor and the sacred ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>“Let’s go ask senior ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to ask the ancestral Dragon about it. Moreover, he still had a large number of fruits of life. He planned to give some of them away to increase the combat strength of the heaven realm as much as possible.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming moved and tore open space. Not long after, he arrived at the lair of Zulong and flew towards the mountain where Zulong lived.</p><p>When he arrived at the hall at the highest point, a figure flashed and stopped Lu Ming.</p><p>It was one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the five elements Qilin.</p><p>senior, I have something to do. I want to visit senior ancestral Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon is recuperating in seclusion. I’m afraid it’s not convenient for him to see you!”</p><p>The five elements Qilin said.</p><p>“Are you healing your injuries in seclusion?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. If he had known that this would happen, he would have asked zu long when he first came back.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed. The figure of the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>The five-star Qilin was taken aback.</p><p>this is just a projection of me. My main body is refining the fruit of life to heal my injuries!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming and the five elements Qilin heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>“Wuxing, you may leave!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The five elements Qilin bowed and accepted the order. He then left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Zu long smiled.</p><p>“Senior, I’ve come this time because I have something to give you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and passed it to zu long.</p><p>zu long took it curiously and scanned it with his spiritual sense. The next moment, his eyes opened wide and his mouth opened wide.</p><p>Initially, with his temperament, there were not many things in the heaven realm that could shock him like this. However, there were such things in the storage ring that Lu Ming gave him.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had a total of one hundred fruits of life in his storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained a total of 180 fruits of life. He had used 15 previously and had 165 left.</p><p>Lu Ming kept sixty-five for himself and gave the rest to the ancestor Dragon.</p><p>“Fruits of life, these are fruits of life, so many!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon muttered to himself and even his breathing became heavy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how did you get so many life fruits?”</p><p>Zu long said in disbelief.</p><p>I’ve had a fortuitous encounter on Yellow Springs Island. I’ve plundered all the life fruits that the island has borne over the years!</p><p>“I’ll give these fruits of life to you, senior. You can use them to heal your injuries!” Lu Ming smiled and continued.</p><p>“No, this is too much. Keep some for yourself!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“This junior has already kept some!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
