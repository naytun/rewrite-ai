The two second-level virtual G.o.d-level giant wolves that were fighting Lu Ming and the others were also cut in half.</p><p>“This battle strength… He’s actually this strong?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er looked at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun with shock in her eyes.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were only at ethereal G.o.d Realm level one, which was the same as her. She thought that they could be strong, but now she realized that she was wrong.</p><p>She estimated that Xic nianqing or Xie nianjun’s combat strength was enough to fight a fourth-level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>He was only at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, but he could fight against a fourth level void G.o.d Realm martial artist!</p><p>sacred grade divine power! They must have mastered the sacred grade divine power!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was amazed. At the same time, she sighed. Lau Ming was already abnormal enough. She did not expect that the people around him were also abnormal.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With Xie nianging and Xie nianjun helping him, he was happy to have an easy time. Then, they took out the beast cores of the four giant wolves. They were worth sixty divine crystals, which was quite a lot.</p><p>After taking out the beast core, they continued to move forward,</p><p>There weren’t any strong wild bcasts in the forest. After walking for a while, they didn’t encounter any beasts above fourth level void G.o.d Realm. The strongest beasts they encountered were only at third level void G.o.d Realm. With Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun around, he and Tong Xi ‘er had an easy time.</p><p>little Qing and Xie nianjun’s combat skills are amazing!</p><p>Along the way, even Lu Ming was secretly sighing,</p><p>Lu Ming himself was considered a natural combat genius. His combat awareness was very strong, but he was still not as good as Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>The battle techniques of the two were perfect, and they could defeat the enemy with the least amount of strength.</p><p>Even if his Shen power was about the same as the two of them, he would not be their match.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this might be related to their experience in their previous lives.</p><p>As time went by, their harvest was getting bigger and bigger. They were about to earn back the 1000 divine crystals they had borrowed from the starry sky battleship. The extra was a net profit.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the group were hunting the dire beasts, there was a mountain peak some distance away from them. Some people were gathered on one of the peaks.</p><p>These people had all concealed their auras and were very careful.</p><p>The two burly men who had discovered Lu Ming’s tracks carlier appeared on the mountain peak and reported to a bald burly man.</p><p>“What? Tong Xi ‘er from the righteous Army has come to the myriad Gold Star?”</p><p>The bald man’s eyes were filled with a cold light.</p><p>that’s right. Moreover, they only sent. four people!</p><p>One of them replied.</p><p>“Four people? What’s their cultivation level?”</p><p>The bald man asked.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s cultivation is still at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. There are two other women who are also at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. The man has the ability to kill a second level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>One of them bowed and reported.</p><p>they’re all at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. Good, good, good. This time, we’ll capture Tong Xi ‘er and give her to young master to play with. We’ll also capture the other two women and let us enjoy ourselves. As for the man, we’ll just kill him!</p><p>“Righteous Army, you’ll die sooner or later if you dare to go against the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>The bald man sneered.</p><p>These people were from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>the three of you are all at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm. You’re more than enough to deal with Tong Xi ‘er and the others. Go and bring them here!</p><p>The bald man ordered three of the brawny Men in Black armor.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three black-armored men cupped their fists.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Suddenly, the bald man shouted, “In order to be foolproof, old man Xiao, you go with them!”</p><p>“Alright, that’s fine too!”</p><p>An old man with a face full of wrinkles chuckled.</p><p>Although he felt that three third-level void G.o.d Realm existences were more than enough to deal with a few juniors, he was a fourth-level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>However, the bald burly man was at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm. He was the strongest among them, so he couldn’t reject him directly.</p><p>Old man Xiao and the three black-armored men flashed and left. The bald man’s eyes looked at the bottom of a cliff in front of him.</p><p>At the bottom of the cliff, there was a cave. From time to time, there would be golden light bursting out.</p><p>Near the cave, there was a bird’s nest, and in the bird’s nest, there was a giant metal Eagle.</p><p>When the bald man looked at the cave, his eyes were burning, but when he saw the giant Eagle, his expression became serious.</p><p>“Treasure, treasure, I must get it!’</p><p>The greed in the bald man’s eyes became even stronger.</p><p>They were from the yuanluo Palace. Not long ago, they had joined forces to come to the myriad Gold Star to hunt dire beasts and obtain their beast cores.</p><p>However, two days ago, a few people from the yuanluo Palace accidentally entered the cave and found a treasure. It was a metal ball with spirituality. When they were about to take the metal ball away, the giant metal Eagle appeared and killed a few of them. Only one person managed to escape and report the news to him.</p><p>His heart immediately burned with excitement. A metal ball with intelligence must be a rare treasure. He immediately brought people over, but he stopped when he saw the giant metal Eagle.</p><p>Although he had the cultivation base of a fifth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert, that giant metal Eagle was a seventh-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. If they charged at it, they would definitely die.</p><p>So, he and his men stayed here to wait for the metal Eagle to leave. They wanted to enter the cave and take the spiritual metal ball.</p><p>After that, he heard news from Tong Xi ‘er, Lu Ming, and the rest.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming and the rest had no idea about all this.</p><p>They went deep into the mountain forest and hunted desolate beasts, their harvest, getting bigger and bigger. They all smiled. At this rate, they would only need to hunt for a while on the myriad Gold Star to earn about 10000 divine crystals cach.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Just as they were walking through the forest, looking for wild beasts to kill, Xie nianjun suddenly looked in a certain direction.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s gazes also shifted in that direction.</p><p>“Hehehe, little girl, your spiritual sense is quite sharp!”</p><p>A sneer was heard. Then, four figures flashed in that direction and appeared.</p><p>These four people were old man Xiao from the yuanluo Palace and the three strong Men in Black armor.</p><p>“You guys… They are from the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>“Hehehe, not bad!”</p><p>Old man Xiao laughed coldly. Iis long and narrow eyes swept across Tong Xi ‘er, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun, When his eyes swept over Xie nianging and Xie nianjun, his eyes were burning with a fiery flame.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er, young master Kang long really misses you. If I take you down and present you to the young master, the young master will definitely reward you handsomely, hehe!</p><p>Old man Xiao licked his lips, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>‘4th level void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s face turned pale.</p><p>22</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
