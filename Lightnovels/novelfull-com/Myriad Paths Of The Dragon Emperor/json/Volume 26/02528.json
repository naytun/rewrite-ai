His long spear swept across the sky and headed toward the two of them.</p><p>Previously, the three peak heavenly emperors were no match for Lu Ming. Now that there were only two left, they were even more outmatched.</p><p>Although the two of them tried their best to resist and counterattack, under the pressure of Lu Ming’s long spear, the two of them continued to retreat. They spat out blood and their bodies cracked.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>“Go report to the king!”</p><p>The other members of the evil god tribe did not dare to stay any longer. Regardless of their cultivation, they all ran for their lives. For a moment, not a single one of them was left in the huge military camp.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the peak-stage heavenly emperors of the evil god tribe was struck in the shoulder by Lu Ming. Half of his body exploded and he was sent flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members was severely injured. Lu Ming had his eyes on the last evil god race member. His blood and Qi were in turmoil, and the power of domination filled the air. Lu Ming’s courage was unparalleled. With the support of the ‘battle character formula’, any random move he made was filled with terrifying combat power.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The peak-stage heavenly Emperor from the evil god tribe was unable to block it. His head was pierced through by the spear and he died on the spot.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged toward the injured evil god tribe member.</p><p>Without a doubt, the evil god tribe member was also killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Since then, the three peak heavenly emperors who were guarding the evil god tribe’s military camp had all died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“The heavens…”</p><p>The beings of the heaven realm were all dumbfounded.</p><p>He had killed three peak heavenly emperors by himself.</p><p>These were peak heavenly emperors. Every one of them stood at the peak of the world. Every one of them was a true Big Shot. However, three of them had died at once.</p><p>The impact of watching three peak heavenly emperors die in front of them was extremely shocking.</p><p>They couldn’t react in time.</p><p>It was only when Lu Ming stepped forward into the evil god tribe’s military camp and was about to disappear that they came to their senses.</p><p>When he finally reacted, he was extremely excited.</p><p>That was because the camp of the non-human race had been breached!</p><p>quick, go back and tell them that the camp of the non-humankind has been broken through. Let the Army come here and fight to the Hunyuan heavenly realm!</p><p>we can take back the Hunyuan heavenly realm now.

Three peak heavenly emperors from the other party have died, and the rest have escaped. Now is a good time!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Really? Three peak heavenly emperors have died, and you’re all just bragging!”</p><p>The people in two world city obviously did not believe him.</p><p>Peak heavenly emperors were not cabbages. There were not many of them in the entire heaven realm and the evil god Realm. How could they die so easily? it’s true. I have to report this to the various exalted Celestials!</p><p>At this moment, a tall and sturdy old man came up to them. He was quite dignified.</p><p>” Heavenly Emperor Liu Yun!”</p><p>Many people in two world city were shocked when they saw the old man.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Liu Zheng was a veteran heavenly Emperor who had been guarding two world city in the past and had a lot of prestige.</p><p>“Could it be that what they said was true?”</p><p>Then, when they thought of this, their eyes revealed a look of horror.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Liujia probably wouldn’t say such things.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts started to beat faster. If this was true, it would be a big deal.</p><p>“Quickly report to the various exalted Celestials!”</p><p>Some people rushed towards two world city.</p><p>Before long, at least a dozen figures arrived on the city walls of two world city. These people were all peerless experts who were guarding two world city.</p><p>Every one of them was a four-star heavenly Emperor or above.
