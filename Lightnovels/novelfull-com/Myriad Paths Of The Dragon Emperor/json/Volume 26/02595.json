BuzzzZZZ!</p><p>In the sky, a sharp cry rang out. Flying desolate beasts appeared in the sky.</p><p>Everyone’s face turned pale.</p><p>“We… What do we do?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s face was also pale.</p><p>“Let’s go all out, little fellow. I’m counting on you!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the metal ball.</p><p>The metal ball was able to deter those metal desolate beasts. Now, they could only rely on the metal ball. Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Countless metal desolate beasts approached. Their terrifying auras came pressing down like an avalanche. “Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Some people had already been swept into the beast tide, and they let out a series of miserable cries. However, in the blink of an eye, there was no sound.</p><p>The metal ball in Lu Ming’s hand expanded. Its big mouth opened and closed, its cyes widened and it glared at the metal desolate beasts.</p><p>When the metal demonic beasts saw the metal ball, they looked frightened. They went around Lu Ming and the others and did not attack them.</p><p>“It’s effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were overjoyed.</p><p>This scene was also seen by the others.</p><p>“Charge at them!”</p><p>they’re fine. We can leave the myriad Gold Star with them!</p><p>The remaining people who had not died rushed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest would not just stand there like fools. They used the metal ball to open up a path and rushed into the beast tide.</p><p>ah, ah, you guys did not save me. You guys will die a terrible death…</p><p>When those people saw Lu Ming and the rest rushing into the beast tide and about to disappear, they all roared madly.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked down on them. These people wanted to kill them just now. They were not fools. How could they possibly save them?</p><p>And he said that he was going to leave them in the lurch. What a joke.</p><p>Screams and rumbles came from behind, and soon, there was no more sound.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest used the metal ball to clear the way. It was very safe and they pa.s.sed through the beast tide without any danger.</p><p>However, after they had advanced for a while, they encountered another horde of beasts with an astonishing number. They were running through the forest, their roars thundering.</p><p>I’ve heard that the myriad Gold Star only has a beast tide once every 10000 years. I didn’t expect that we would encounter one this time!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said. There was a look of lingering fear on her face. This time, if they didn’t have the metal ball, they would also be in danger, and it would most likely be a disaster.</p><p>They pa.s.sed through the beast tide with the metal ball and entered a forest.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Not long after they entered the forest, they heard the roars of wild beasts. At the same time, there were sword Qi and Saber Light that soared into the sky.</p><p>It was obvious that someone was fighting with the wild beasts.</p><p>The next moment, they saw a group of people rushing over here, followed by a bunch of dire beasts. “It’s him.”</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the rest changed.</p><p>One them was the bald man from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>The other person was the old man from Fengyun Hall.</p><p>At this moment, they were all in a sorry state as they were being chased by a group of desolate beasts. “It’s them! It’s those b.a.s.t.a.r.ds!”</p><p>The bald man from the origin net Palace also saw Lu Ming and the others. His eyes glowed with a cold light. Then, the bald man from the origin Luo Palace charged at Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The rest of them followed the bald man and charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>It was obvious that he wanted to drag Lu Ming and the rest into the water.</p><p>“You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Let’s bring them to the beast. tide!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xie nianging and the rest. Their eyes lit up as they understood what Lu Ming and the rest were up to.</p><p>They turned around and ran towards the beast tide.</p><p>The bald burly man and the rest were in hot pursuit, following closely behind Lu Ming. They had just pa.s.sed through the beast horde, so they were not far away. Soon, they saw a large group of dire beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the metal ball in his storage ring.</p><p>“Roar!” “Roar!</p><p>The moment the dire beasts saw Lu Ming and his group, they charged at them in a frenzy.</p><p>‘Not good!”</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The bald man and the others were shocked.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s group turned around and rushed towards the bald man and the others, bringing along a large group of dire beasts.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, you all deserve to die!”</p><p>“A bunch of lunatics!”</p><p>The bald burly man and the rest roared. They thought that Lu Ming and the rest could not escape and would die with them.</p><p>“You guys, get out, get out!”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“Didn’t you want to chase us just now? Why are you telling us to get lost now?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and continued to chase after the bald man and the rest.</p><p>The bald burly man and the others revealed looks of despair. There was a large group of desolate beasts</p><p>behind them, and there were even more desolate beasts in front. In the sky, there were also densely packed flying desolate beasts.</p><p>He simply had no way out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest suddenly stopped. Then, the metal ball in his hand appeared again.</p><p>He took out the metal ball and the dire beasts automatically bypa.s.sed Lu Ming and the rest, pouncing on the bald man and the rest.</p><p>“Enjoy it”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he, Xie nianqing, and the rest rushed into the group of dire beasts, safe and sound.</p><p>“Ah, ah ah!”</p><p>The bald man, the old man of Fengyun Hall, roared in anger and hysteria.</p><p>They were aggrieved, unwilling, and afraid to dic…</p><p>They understood that they had been tricked by Lu Ming.</p><p>They wanted to charge at Lu Ming and the rest, but countless dire beasts had already drowned them.</p><p>A few fifth-level virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts charged at the bald man. The bald man tried his best to block a</p><p>few moves before he was torn apart and died on the spot.</p><p>The old man of Fengyun Hall was also torn to pieces by the wild beasts after only a few moves.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them left the place.</p><p>now that there’s a beast tide, be it on the ground or in the sky, there are terrifying dire beasts. There shouldn’t be any experts in the sky blocking us, right? let’s leave now!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone nodded. Those powerhouses had probably left the myriad Gold Star after seeing the beast tide.</p><p>However, with so many desolate beasts in the sky, they naturally could not take out the starry sky battleship to fly. They had to pa.s.s through the group of desolate beasts before they could leave.</p><p>They flew toward the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a sharp screech was heard. A huge silver-white Eagle that looked as if it was made of silver flew over and fixed its eyes on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from the Condor, causing Lu Ming and the rest’s hearts to race.</p><p>Terrifying! It was so terrifying!</p><p>The Condor gave them a terrifying feeling, It was even more terrifying than the seventh level void G.o.d Realm</p><p>wild beasts they had encountered before.</p><p>It was definitely an existence that had surpa.s.sed the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>This kind of existence was too shocking. Lu Ming felt that the other party could kill him in one move.</p><p>The silver Condor’s cold eyes stared at them. Lu Ming and the others could not help but tense up and break</p><p>out in cold sweat.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The metal ball opened its mouth wide and stared at the Eagle.</p><p>The silver Condor’s gaze landed on the metal. Unlike other desolate beasts, there was not much fear in the</p><p>silver Condor’s eyes.</p><p>D</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
