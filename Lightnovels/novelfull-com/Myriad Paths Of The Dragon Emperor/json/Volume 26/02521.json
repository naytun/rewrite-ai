When your combat strength reaches a certain level, you will be able to break through the heavenly Dao’s obstruction with your powerful strength and forcefully enter the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt enlightened!</p><p>As a martial God Realm expert, zu long pointed him in the right direction.</p><p>In his future cultivation, he would focus on the Dao of domination and the battle formula. As long as his combat power was strong enough, he would be able to break through the heavenly Dao and step into the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and thanked him.</p><p>“No need for thanks, Lu Ming. Now, you’re the variable in this war and the hope of the heaven realm. The outcome of this war depends on you!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Senior’s words are too serious!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s not a serious matter. It’s a fact. Now, our heaven realm is completely passive!</p><p>the non-human divine ancestor has obtained enough fruits of life. He and sacred ancestor bloodheart will definitely try their best to recover. Even if I fight the non-human divine ancestor with my life, he’ll be able to stop me and give sacred ancestor bloodheart some time to recover. By the time sacred ancestor bloodheart recovers, we’ll be in trouble!</p><p>if I don’t go fight the divine ancestor, I won’t be able to stop them by myself when they recover. The other demigods won’t be able to reach the martial God Realm. We’re in a passive position!</p><p>but you’re different. As long as you follow the Dao of domination and step into the heavenly Emperor realm, you’ll be able to dominate the power of the heavens and earth. You’ll be able to fight against a martial God. Therefore, you’re the hope of the heaven realm now!</p><p>Zu long said a long string of words.</p><p>Lu Ming also fell silent. He understood that the ancestral Dragon was right.</p><p>“I will try my best to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded solemnly.</p><p>with the help of the fruit of life, the non-human divine ancestor Moke and I will recover in a few hundred years at most. However, Saint ancestor bloodheart’s injuries are more serious, so he will definitely need more time. But I estimate that Saint ancestor bloodheart will recover in a thousand years at most!</p><p>therefore, we only have a thousand years left!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“A thousand years?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and clenched his fists.</p><p>He had to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm within a thousand years.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the path of domination is too profound. I’ve only heard of it in the past, but I’ve never seen it. I can’t give you much advice, so you’ll have to rely on yourself!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“I still have to thank senior this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and cupped his fists.</p><p>okay. If you have any other questions in the future, you can come to me at any time. Go!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left the lair of Zulong, returning to the heaven realm.</p><p>“At most a thousand years. There’s not much time left!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The final battle would break out in a thousand years at most.</p><p>In the next thousand years, not only would he not be able to break through, but Lu Ming also wanted his family and friends to break through and improve their cultivation as soon as possible. Fortunately, when the catastrophe came, they would have enough power to protect themselves.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to choose a good place in the heaven realm and gather all his family and friends together. He would pool the resources for everyone to cultivate.</p><p>In fact, his current small world was already big enough. However, although it was big enough, the cultivation conditions were still incomparable to the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming left two world city and started searching in the heaven realm.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming appeared in the southern region of the Tai Qing heavenly region, standing on a vast mountain.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>This mountain range was extremely rich in original Qi. One of the main peaks was a hundred thousand feet tall, piercing through the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared at the peak of the mountain. Then, with a thought, his small world appeared.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. In the small world, the path-understanding ancient tree rose from its roots, bringing with it a large amount of soil. It flew out of the small world and landed on the peak of the mountain.</p><p>As soon as it landed on the peak, the roots of the path-understanding ancient tree wriggled and dug into the soil of the mountain, taking root.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to plant the path-understanding ancient tree here first and turn this place into a cultivation sanctuary. He would gather all his family and friends here.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree was 3000 meters tall. It covered the sky and was extremely huge.</p><p>The aura of the great Dao lingered between each branch.</p><p>Wuwuwu…</p><p>Roar…</p><p>As soon as the path-understanding ancient tree appeared, countless demonic beasts and strange beasts in the surrounding mountains sensed it and frantically gathered here.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted coldly. A terrifying aura burst out and enveloped all the mountains.</p><p>It was as if a giant dragon was looking down at a group of ants. All the demonic beasts were almost scared to death and ran away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming moved and began to inscribe a large formation near the mountain range, encompassing a radius of a million miles.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a whole month before he managed to inscribe a large array.</p><p>my array Dao cultivation is far from enough. In the future, I’ll get dandan to work hard and carve a large array!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Then, he sent a message to Earth One, Thunder one, and the others to come over.</p><p>Not long after, Earth One, Thunder one, and the rest arrived.</p><p>“In the future, you will all sit here and guard the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Earth One and the rest accepted the order.</p><p>“Also, take these six weapons!”</p><p>Six weapons appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he passed them to first wind, first fire, and the rest.</p><p>“This …What an amazing weapon!”</p><p>When fire one and the other six sensed it, they were extremely shocked.</p><p>this is equivalent to a heaven Dao soldier’s weapon. As long as you inject energy into it, it can be used!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming had brought out dozens of weapons of this level from netherworld mountain.</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and Thunder one each had a heaven Dao soldier. Lu Ming did not give one to them, but gave one to fire one and the others.</p><p>“Many thanks, young master!”</p><p>Fire one and the others thanked him gratefully. Then, they led the other puppets of the primal Chaos Palace to build something in the area.</p><p>Soon, huge halls and various cultivation grounds spread out with the pathunderstanding ancient tree as the center.</p><p>Next, he went to the battlefield outside two world city and found evil swordsman and Jian feiliu.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s origin had also been injured in the ancient battle. Lu Ming gave evil swordsman a life fruit, and after evil swordsman consumed it, his injuries healed not long after.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s original cultivation was a five-star heavenly Emperor. Now, not only had his injuries healed, but he had also broken through and become a six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not stay for long. After giving evil swordsman a fruit of life, he left and returned to the primordial realm. He brought the people of the Dragon Alliance and the people of Dragon God Valley to the heaven realm, to the new territory that he had opened up.</p><p>When the people from the Dragon Alliance arrived, they suggested that this place be called the Dragon sovereign peak. Lu Ming did not object.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
