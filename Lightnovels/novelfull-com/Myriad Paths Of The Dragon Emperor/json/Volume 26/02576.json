How was that possible? Although Lu Ming was terrifyingly talented, his cultivation level was still low. At most, his combat strength was on par with hers. What could she do?</p><p>One should know that there were at least a few ninth-tier virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses in the stellar iron ore. As for the seventh-tier and eighth-tier virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses, Lu Ming would probably be killed with one slap if he went there.</p><p>“Sometimes, you don’t need to rely on force to save people. Let me show you something, and you’ll know!” Lu Ming smiled. He waved his hand and a person appeared in his hand.</p><p>This man was the young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long!</p><p>‘I’m alone…</p><p>At first, the young woman was stunned, but then her beautiful pupils suddenly enlarged.</p><p>“This is … The young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long?”</p><p>The young woman gasped. She had never expected to meet. Kang long here.</p><p>“You’ve seen it before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’ve seen him a few times!” The woman said. She seemed to have thought of something, and a bright smile appeared on her face.</p><p>Kang long had been locked up by Lu Ming for more than half a year and was already in a daze. He was stunned for a while before he could see the situation clearly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re dead, I’m telling you, you’re dead. Let me go, or I’ll make sure you don’t even have a corpse left. Tong Xi ‘er, what are you doing here?”</p><p>When Kang long first saw Lu Ming, he shouted at the top of his lungs. Then, his gaze swept past the young lady and he was stunned.</p><p>“Kang long, I didn’t expect you to end up like this. Hehehe, looks like I’m quite lucky!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er sized up Kang long and sneered.</p><p>“You… What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Kang Long’s face paled.</p><p>“You speak too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He waved his hand and kept Kang long.</p><p>my cultivation isn’t high enough. Even with Kang long, I’m afraid I’ll be killed instantly if I encounter an expert at or above the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm. However, you have a ninth level void G.o.d Realm expert. If he uses Kang long to exchange for the people of the righteous sky Army and the starry sky warship, he’ll have full confidence!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This was his plan.</p><p>If he could exchange Kang long for the people of the righteous heaven Army and the interplanetary warship, he could leave shadowed star and owe the righteous heaven Army a favor. Why not?</p><p>alright, if I succeed this time, we’ll definitely be grateful!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s face was also filled with joy.</p><p>by the way, I’m Tong Xi ‘er. What’s your name?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>brother Lu, let’s go. I’ll bring you to meet the people of our zhengtian Army!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said. Then, her figure flashed and she headed in a direction.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Tong Xi ‘er closely.</p><p>Neither of them flew in the air. Instead, they ran on the ground. However, their speed was also very fast. After running for a few hours, the two of them arrived at a rather remote Canyon.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>stop! a middle-aged man shouted as soon as the two of them arrived. He appeared in front of them and blocked them.</p><p>“Uncle Liu, it’s me!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“Xi ‘er…”</p><p>When the middle-aged man saw that it was Tong Xi ‘er, he smiled. Then, he glanced at Lu Ming, and a hint of wariness appeared in his eyes. Xi ‘er, who is he?” he asked.</p><p>He couldn’t help but be on his guard. This was planct underworld, the territory of the yuan Luo Palace. The righteous Army and the yuan Luo Palace were sworn enemies. The remaining members of the righteous Army were all here. Now that he saw a strange man, he naturally had to be on guard.</p><p>“Uncle Liu, his name is Lu Ming, He is also an enemy of the yuanluo Palace. He has a way to help us save uncle w.a.n.g and the others!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“Ile has a way to save her?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with suspicion.</p><p>He could tell at a glance that. Lu Ming was only at the transformation void martial stage. Such a cultivation was not worth mentioning in his eyes. How could he possibly have a way to save their companions?</p><p>“Xi ‘er, don’t be fooled by him. He might be from the yuanluo Palace to win your trust…</p><p>At this point, the middle-aged man’s face turned ugly. If that was the case, they were all in danger.</p><p>His body was already filled with cold killing intent, ready to attack at any time.</p><p>“Uncle Liu, he won’t. He has the young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long.”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er hurriedly said.</p><p>“The young master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang long?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s aura immediately weakened, and his face was filled with bewilderment.</p><p>If Lu Ming really had Kang long, he would definitely not be from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>Even if it was to capture them, he would not use Kang long to risk his life. It was impossible.</p><p>This was also the reason why Tong Xi ‘er could bring Lu Ming here without worry.</p><p>“That’s right. Kang long is in my book. Miss Xi ‘er has already read it!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately told him his plan.</p><p>“Good, good, good. Haha, brother Lu Ming, I misunderstood you just now. I’m sorry!”</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed in embarra.s.sment.</p><p>‘I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Under such circ.u.mstances, it was normal for the other party to be more cautious.</p><p>“I’ll take you to see Deputy general sun!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said. Then, he led Lu Ming and Tong Xi ‘er into the depths of the canyon,</p><p>Deep in the canyon, Lu Ming saw a group of people. There were about thirty of them.</p><p>They were all experts, and all of them were at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm or above. Among these people, Tong Xi ‘er’s cultivation was the weakest.</p><p>‘Deputy general sun…”</p><p>The middle-aged man and Tong Xi ‘er bowed to one of the gray-robed elders.</p><p>This grey-robed old man was Deputy general sun!</p><p>The highest position in the righteous heaven Army was the general, who was also the ancestor of technique. Below the general, there were some Deputy generals, and below them, there were the generals and Deputy</p><p>generals.</p><p>This old man was a Deputy general and a ninth-level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>When the people in the canyon saw Lu Ming, they were all on guard. However, when Tong Xi ‘er and the</p><p>others said that Lu Ming had Kang long, they were all overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and Kang long appeared.</p><p>“It’s really Kang long. I’ve seen him once!”</p><p>“Hahaha, we’re saved!”</p><p>When the righteous Army saw Kang long, they were all ecstatic.</p><p>He was no longer on guard against Lu Ming.</p><p>Kang Long’s face turned pale when he saw so many Righteous Army soldiers. Ile cowered and did not dare to</p><p>shout anymore.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll have to trouble you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pa.s.sed Kang long to Deputy general sun.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, if we can escape this time, you can state any conditions you have!”</p><p>Deputy general sun laughed.</p><p>“Junior’s condition is very simple. I just want to leave with you all, and then I need a place to settle my family</p><p>and friends!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, that’s easy. Our Zheng Tian Army has occupied more than a dozen life planets. We don’t have much else, but we have a huge territory. You can choose whatever you want!</p><p>Deputy general sun grinned and took Kang long.</p><p>£3</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
