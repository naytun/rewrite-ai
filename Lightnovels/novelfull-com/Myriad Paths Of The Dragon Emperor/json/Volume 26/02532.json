The non-human King was forced to retreat.</p><p>He was accidentally hit by Lu Ming’s long spear and retreated while spitting out</p><p>blood.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>“Kill, kill him!”</p><p>The heaven realm beings cried out in excitement. They hoped that Lu Ming</p><p>could kill the other party.</p><p>If they could kill even one of the unrivaled experts of the other party, it would be enough to make the evil god race feel the pinch.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, you can’t do it alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The non-human King’s face was extremely ugly.</p><p>“I’ll go help him!”</p><p>Another non-human King in the Army gritted his teeth. He took a step forward</p><p>and charged at Lu Ming with a sword in his hand.</p><p>“Haha, now this is more like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and waved his spear, fighting the two kings.</p><p>The remaining non-human Kings wanted to make a move, but the heavenly Thunder Emperor and the heavenly tiger emperor had already set their eyes on each other.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the two non-human Kings began an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage. He was no match for the two non-human</p><p>Kings.</p><p>However, the situation was slightly better than the last time.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming could only defend and could not retaliate.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming could occasionally retaliate and fight with the other party.</p><p>He would probably be able to counterattack once in every twenty moves.</p><p>Just like that, the two sides fought for more than 300 moves.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally felt that he was no match for them. He had</p><p>used up a lot of his World Energy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the other party’s encirclement and retreated ten thousand miles.</p><p>haha, that’s it for today. Let’s fight another day!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and took a step forward, leaving the place.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>The Kings of the non-human race bellowed in anger. However, they were helpless. After exchanging so many blows, they had exhausted themselves and could not stop Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’s using us to train himself!”</p><p>One of the non-human Kings said coldly.</p><p>With their wisdom, they naturally knew Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the place where he went into seclusion the last time and continued to cultivate and comprehend the ‘battle character formula’. He had also gained a lot from this battle.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had been in seclusion for a year.</p><p>His understanding of the ‘battle’ formula had deepened. Naturally, his strength had also increased.</p><p>However, he still could not break through the bottleneck of the ‘battle formula’. He was stuck there and it made Lu Ming very uncomfortable.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the front of the alien army and began to challenge the alien King.</p><p>But this time, the Kings didn’t fight at all.</p><p>They knew Lu Ming’s plan. He wanted to use them to train himself. They would not fight and let Lu Ming benefit from it.</p><p>Unfortunately, they had underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>Seeing that the non-human King was not coming out, Lu Ming began to curse. The more he cursed, the worse his words became. Even the ordinary evil god tribe members ‘eyes were burning with anger, let alone the non-human King. They wanted to come out and fight Lu Ming to the death.</p><p>“Damn it, I’m going to slaughter this brat!”</p><p>One of the non-human Kings roared. He could not take it anymore and rushed out of the camp to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile!</p><p>He had been hanging out with dandan for so long, so of course he had learned a lot. If you don’t come out, I’ll scold you until you doubt your life.</p><p>“Let’s go out together and kill him!”</p><p>The other non-human Kings were filled with killing intent. They went out together to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in the heaven realm, Heavenly Thunder Emperor and heavenly tiger emperor had been paying attention to this side for a long time. As soon as the Kings moved, they also came out and blocked two of them, only letting one pass.</p><p>A total of two non-human Kings were fighting Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, it was better than a year ago. Lu Ming had improved a lot.</p><p>A year ago, Lu Ming could only counterattack once every twenty moves he made when he faced two kings of the mutated tribe.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming could counterattack once in every ten moves. It was much easier to deal with him.</p><p>“This monster!”</p><p>The non-human King was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s improvement was too shocking. He could improve a little after every big battle.</p><p>After a few hundred moves, Lu Ming felt that it was about time and retreated.</p><p>“Next time, I definitely can’t fight!”</p><p>The Kings of the other races looked at each other and made a decision.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate in seclusion. He only came out after a year.</p><p>“I still haven’t broken through. What’s going on? This battle formula is really hard to cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He felt that the difficulty of cultivating the battle character formula was even more difficult and profound than the path of domination.</p><p>evil god race, get out here and fight me!</p><p>Lu Ming ran to the front of the evil god tribe’s Army and started his challenge.</p><p>But the non-humankind Army was silent.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to fight? Isn’t the great evil god race high and mighty? to think that you don’t even dare to fight! How embarrassing!” aren’t you all very strong? you don’t even dare to fight me, someone who has cultivated for hundreds of years. What a bunch of trash! If I were you, I would just destroy my own cultivation!</p><p>“King of the outsiders, are you guys the reincarnation of a turtle?</p><p>Lu Ming started to curse. The more he cursed, the worse his words became. However, the king of the non-human race just stayed in the military camp and did not come out to fight.</p><p>damn it! When the two divine ancestors recover, I’ll definitely crush this Lu</p><p>Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes!</p><p>One of the more irascible non-human Kings roared. He was furious.</p><p>They were the Kings of the non-human race, the overlords of the evil god tribe. In the evil god tribe, they were high and mighty figures who ruled over an area. But now, in front of the countless evil god tribe troops, they were being scolded</p><p>so badly by Lu Ming.</p><p>The most important thing was that they could only hide and not fight. It was</p><p>too depressing.</p><p>Furthermore, it was a huge blow to the evil god tribe’s morale.</p><p>However, they had no choice but to go out and fight. Instead, they helped Lu</p><p>Ming.</p><p>“Don’t worry. It won’t take long for the two divine ancestors to recover. Once they recover, Lu Ming will be nothing. The divine ancestors can suppress them with a flip of their hands. When the heaven realm is flattened and the sky is opened, we can all break through to the martial God Realm and become gods!”</p><p>The other King was much calmer.</p><p>“Split open the heavens! God!”</p><p>The eyes of the other non-human Kings all lit up.</p><p>They had been stuck at the demigod realm for too long, but in the evil god Realm and heaven realm, they had reached their limits and couldn’t break</p><p>through at all.</p><p>Only by successfully splitting open the sky could they break through.</p><p>Lu Ming cursed for a long time outside, but the king of the non-human race did not fight.</p><p>“These guys probably already know that I’m using them to train myself, so they’re all hiding!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think I have no way to deal with you just because you’re hiding? Then I’ll go to the ruins of end battlefield now!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The battlefield of the ruins of end was another battlefield.</p><p>There were two battlefields in the Tai Qing heavenly region. One of them was the battlefield in the two world city, which was connected to the Hunyuan heavenly region.</p><p>One of the ruins of end battlefields was connected to the ancient demon territory.</p><p>Sila!</p><p>Lu Ming tore open the space and stepped in.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to travel through the long space and enter the battlefield of the ultimate.</p><p>This kind of long-distance cross-realm travel could only be done by peak heavenly Emperor and above.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
