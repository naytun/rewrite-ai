However, it couldn’t block the bald man’s attack,</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was extremely anxious at the side. However, with her strength, the difference between her and the bald man was too great. She would only die if she went up.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The bald burly man bellowed. He saw that the metal ball was following Lu Ming and had the greatest killing intent toward him. He wanted to get rid of Lu Ming first.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cyes narrowed and he retreated rapidly. At the same time, he exploded his ruler’s power to the maximum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bald burly man’s saber radiance was incomparably dazzling as it slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As Lu Ming retreated, he slashed out with his sword and it collided with the bald man’s saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword and saber collided, sending sparks flying in all directions. Lu Ming fell an extremely terrifying force surging towards him. His body shook violently and he flew out like a cannonball, crashing into the wall of the valley. Even the metal wall cracked and caved in.</p><p>PM!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt that his arm was about to break from the impact. The divine weapon sword in his hand had actually been chipped.</p><p>“A level five low grade G.o.d equipment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The battle saber in the bald man’s hand was a level five low quality G.o.d weapon, while the Battle Sword in his hand was only a level three low quality G.o.d weapon. It was normal for the other party to have a crack in it.</p><p>In the primal universe, divine weapons were divided into four major levels: low-grade, medium-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.</p><p>Each level was further divided into nine ranks.</p><p>The combat sword in Lu Ming’s hand was given to him by Bai Ya. It was a level three low-grade divine artifact and was the highest-level divine artifact that. Lu Ming bad.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this time, the metal ball charged at the bald man again. Its size had become even bigger, with a diameter of ten meters. It was like a small hill as it smashed towards the bald man.</p><p>“Xie nianjun, dark holy light technique!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sent a message to Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianjun nodded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Brilliant light burst out from the two of them. One was black and the other was white, like a Black Sun and a white sun.</p><p>Then, the black and white light intertwined and formed a cage, enveloping the bald man in it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bald man struck the cage with all his might, but it didn’t break.</p><p>This was the dark holy light cage, a secret skill that could only be used by Xie nianging and Xie nianjun when they worked together.</p><p>When the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm had fought, the two of them had worked together to trap the sacred ancestor bloodheart for a while.</p><p>Back then, they had only been demiG.o.ds, but they had been able to trap sacred ancestor bloodheart, who was at the void G.o.d Realm,</p><p>Now that both of them had broken through to the void G.o.d Realm, their cultivation techniques had changed, and they could control divine power. The power of this technique was much stronger than before.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The bald burly man went berserk. Iis blade glowed brightly as he launched a frenzied attack. However, it was blocked by the dark holy light cage. He couldn’t break it at all,</p><p>“Lu Ming, attack””</p><p>Xic nianqing shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. He exerted all his strength and slashed his combat sword madly. Sword Qi rushed towards the bald man as if it was free.</p><p>At the same time, Tong Xi ‘er also charged over and attacked with all her might.</p><p>In addition, the metal ball would seize the opportunity to hit the bald man from time to time.</p><p>The dark holy light cage did not stop Lu Ming and the rest at all. Their attacks bombarded the bald burly man</p><p>to their heart’s content.</p><p>At this moment, the bald burly man was like a live target, allowing Lu Ming and the rest to attack him.</p><p>The bald burly man waved his saber with all his might to block the attacks from Lu Ming and the rest. However, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s dark holy light cage could not only trap him, but also attack him. Black and white lotuses emerged from the dark holy light, cage and turned into sword Qi. They danced and attacked the bald man.</p><p>For a moment, the bald man was fl.u.s.tered and could only try his best to resist.</p><p>However, he could only defend and not attack. He was a live target and there would always be times when he</p><p>was careless.</p><p>PIT!</p><p>A black sword light streaked across his body, leaving a deep sword wound that was bleeding profusely. He bellowed in anger and retreated rapidly, crashing into the dark holy light cage. A white sword light.</p><p>flashed, and his chest was almost pierced.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bald man let out a beast-like roar.</p><p>Ile was an existence at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm, yet he was injured by a few juniors at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. He was furious.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useless no matter how angry he was.</p><p>After a while, he was even more outmatched. He staggered after being hit by the metal ball. Lu Ming scized the opportunity and almost beheaded him with a slash of his sword, leaving a sword wound that was a few</p><p>feet long on his chest.</p><p>The bald man’s strength started to weaken,</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and his attacks became more violent.</p><p>don’t even think about it. You juniors can forget about killing me!</p><p>The bald burly man roared. His aura suddenly skyrocketed, as if there was a flame burning.</p><p>Burning Shen power!</p><p>The bald burly man was going all out!</p><p>Normal people would not burn their Shen power unless it was a critical moment. This was because if they burned their Shen power too much, their cultivation might decrease and even leave behind terrifying after-effects that would make it difficult for them increase their cultivation in the future.</p><p>Usually, if they did not encounter an especially dangerous situation, they would not risk their lives like this.</p><p>However, the bald man had no choice but to risk his life. If he didn’t, he might die Here.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The burning of his divine power increased the bald man’s strength by a large margin. He broke through everyone’s attacks with a single strike, then heavily slashed at the dark holy light cage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The dark holy light cage started to shake violently.</p><p>BOOM! ROOM! Following that, the bald burly man bombarded the dark holy light cage in a frenzy, causing the cage to shake</p><p>more and more violently.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s delicate bodies trembled as their faces turned pale.</p><p>The bald burly man attacked fifty to sixty times in a row, and he specifically attacked a certain area.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>That area finally couldn’t hold on any longer and a crack appeared. Then, the crack collapsed and a gap</p><p>appeared</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bald man seized the opportunity and rushed out of the gap. He then turned into a rainbow light and sped</p><p>into the distance.</p><p>“I will take revenge for this sooner or later!”</p><p>The bald burly man’s furious roar could be heard. He actually did not dare to stay. He needed to find a place</p><p>to stop and burn his Shen power to recuperate. If he continued, not only would his cultivation level fall, but it would also leave behind terrifying after-effects.</p><p>It would be a great loss if there were terrifying after-effects that would prevent him from improving his cultivation in the future. Compared to killing Lu Ming and the rest, his future was more important.</p><p>He would have another chance to kill Lu Ming and the rest in the future.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the bald man had disappeared.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed secretly.</p><p>However, he also knew that their cultivation base was too low. It was already extremely shocking that they</p><p>could force a fifth-level void G.o.d Realm existence into such a state.</p><p>@</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
