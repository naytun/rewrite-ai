As soon as they got close, they lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy as he flew at top speed. However, as time passed, the distance between him and the two middle-aged men was getting closer and closer.</p><p>“Brat, you won’t be able to escape…”</p><p>One of the burly men said ferociously, his aura overbearing.</p><p>The two middle-aged men were both at the second level of the void God Realm. If Lu Ming was in his normal state, he would not be a match for them. Therefore, Lu Ming kept triggering the battle formula as he flew.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There seemed to be an explosion in his body. The double combat power of the battle formula had been successfully activated.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take action immediately. Instead, he continued flying.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, both parties were far away from the city and flew into a forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s figure that was flying at high speed came to a halt.</p><p>Not only that, but he also charged at the two middle-aged men. A combat sword appeared in his hand and he slashed.</p><p>The two middle-aged men did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly stop running and charge at them instead. They could not stop in their tracks and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two middle-aged men also made their moves. They each launched a move. However, it had happened too suddenly, so they could only use 50% of their combat strength at most.</p><p>A second-tier void God could only exert 50% of his combat strength. He could not withstand Lu Ming’s full power at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>One of the middle-aged men did not even have the chance to scream before he</p><p>was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>The other burly man retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his combat sword and charged at the middle-aged man with cold killing intent.</p><p>The middle-aged man finally came to his senses. He took out a saber and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword and saber collided, causing a violent tremor. The middle-aged man’s figure was forced to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat power was doubled after activating the battle formula. Although he was not a match for a third level virtual God-level martial artist, he had an absolute advantage over a second level virtual God-level martial artist.</p><p>After forcing the middle-aged man back with one move, Lu Ming continued to attack his opponent, launching a storm of attacks.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s roar was like thunder. Naturally, he was not willing to be killed, so he fought back with all his might.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously. However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was ultimately stronger. The middle-aged man was no match for him. After more than ten moves, both his arms were shattered by the impact. He was sent flying backward and spat out blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his sword and charged forward, killing the middle-aged man.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, two figures flew over from the direction of the city, exuding cold killing intent.</p><p>It was obvious that the commotion of the battle had alerted the other experts</p><p>of the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. With a wave of his hand, he kept the storage rings of the two middle-aged men. Then, he turned into a ray of light and flew away at high speed.</p><p>The two people who came later were very powerful. One of them was at the second level of the void God Realm, while the other had a terrifying aura and had reached the third level of the void God Realm.</p><p>This was not the heaven realm. Lu Ming could mobilize the power of the heaven realm’s primordial realm and the evil god Realm. Here, Lu Ming was definitely not a match for a third level void God Realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at top speed, with two people in hot pursuit behind him. These two people also looked middle-aged. One of them was a burly man with a single horn on his head, while the other was a human with loose hair. The human’s cultivation was at the third level of the void God Realm.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one fleeing, flew tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly dashed out from a mountain peak in front of Lu Ming. It was a burly elder who was holding a crystal ball in his hand.</p><p>At this moment, the crystal ball was flashing and reflecting light. “Hahaha, you’ve really worn out your iron shoes in a long search, but you found it without any effort!”</p><p>The burly old man laughed and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>A terrifying fist force came crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The fist force had yet to arrive, but it brought with it a terrifying wave that pressed down on Lu Ming, making him hold his breath.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and slashed with his sword.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The combat sword and the fist force collided. The combat sword shook violently. Lu Ming felt a violent force surging towards him. He could not help but retreat backward, his qi and blood churning.</p><p>third level void God Realm is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming steadied his body, his expression grave.</p><p>With his current combat strength, he couldn’t deal with a third level void God Realm existence.</p><p>Unless his cultivation base broke through to the three-star heavenly Emperor realm and the battle formula doubled his combat power, he would not be able to compete with a third level void God Realm expert.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stopped, the two people behind him caught up and surrounded him.</p><p>Two of them were at the third level of the void God Realm, and one was at the second level of the void God Realm.</p><p>“Hehe, kid, let’s see how you’re going to escape this time.”</p><p>The one-horned man sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was no match for the two third level void God-level powerhouses. He was about to use Kang long to threaten them. With Kang long in his hands, he did not believe that the other party would dare to make a move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>However, at this moment, the burly man with messy hair made his move. He was very decisive. A long spear appeared in his hand. A terrifying spear radiance shot out with a terrifying whistling sound and pierced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not give Lu Ming any chance to react. Lu Ming could only wave his sword to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The combat sword and the long spear collided and Lu Ming retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly elder and the one-horned man also made their moves and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The old man’s fist force was astonishing. He was wearing a pair of gloves on his hands, which were clearly divine artifacts. Every punch was terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to block a few moves. His body was in great pain as if it was about to split open.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The man with messy hair suddenly changed the direction of his spear. He was no longer attacking Lu Ming but the burly elder instead.</p><p>The burly old man had never thought that the other party would suddenly attack him. He had not been prepared at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the old man’s forehead and the old man died. This scene not only stunned Lu Ming but also the one-horned burly man. Then, he roared,” “Song mo, what are you doing?”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The reply to the horned man was the disheveled-haired man’s cold shout. He took advantage of the situation and pulled out his long spear, sweeping it across and hitting the horned man.</p><p>The horned man screamed as his body was split into two.</p><p>-Go down and find the answer yourself!”</p><p>The big man with messy hair said coldly. Then, he thrust his spear again and killed the one-horned man.</p><p>It happened so suddenly that the burly elder and the horned man were killed by the burly man with messy hair in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated and was on guard.</p><p>He was very curious as to why the other party would suddenly kill each other. The burly man with disheveled hair looked at Lu Ming with a complicated look in his eyes. He seemed to be reminiscing about the past.. After a moment of silence, he said,”You’re from the heaven realm, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
