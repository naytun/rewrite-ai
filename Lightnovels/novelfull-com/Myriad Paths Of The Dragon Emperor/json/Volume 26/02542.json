She then pressed her hands forward.</p><p>In the area in front of her, everything seemed to have stopped.</p><p>The heaven realm and evil G.o.d tribe’s experts who were in the middle of a battle were forbidden from not moving.</p><p>At the same time, a figure suddenly appeared in the originally empty void. It was a four-armed evil G.o.d tribe member.</p><p>At this moment, the face of the evil G.o.d tribe member was filled with shock and horror.</p><p>He had been hiding in the void, trying to a.s.sa.s.sinate the heaven realm’s powerhouses, but he had been forced out of the void by bubbles. Moreover, his entire body had been confined by a powerful force, rendering him unable to move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As the bubble charged past, the evil G.o.d tribe member’s body was turned into dust.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>However, in the next moment, a series of sharp radiances shot out from all directions towards Pao Pao with frightening speed and power.</p><p>‘I’ll retreat!’</p><p>Even though bubbles retreated rapidly, there was also a terrifying blade slashing towards her from behind.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party had seen through bubbles threat and had sent a few experts to attack her in an attempt to get rid of her.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Bubble’s body was cut into two, then turned into dust and dissipated.</p><p>Following that, a few short evil G.o.d tribesmen appeared in the sky. Their expressions were grave as they looked around.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>All of a sudden, cracks appeared in the s.p.a.ce around them. Then, the s.p.a.ce started to twist and turn into a cage that trapped the short evil G.o.d race members.</p><p>“Not good, break!”</p><p>One of the evil G.o.d race members howled as a few of them attacked together. In their hands, they were all holding curved blades that were astonishingly sharp, With a casual slash of their blades, they could easily slice</p><p>apart s.p.a.ce.</p><p>However, they were unable to cut through the s.p.a.ce that was created by bubbles.</p><p>Their weapons slashed at the surrounding s.p.a.ce, causing it to ripple like water, but it quickly returned to its original state.</p><p>“Time reversal!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Paopao muttered softly as she waved her hands continuously. A mysterious aura enveloped the few members of the evil G.o.d race.</p><p>A shocking scene appeared. The auras of the evil G.o.d tribe members were rapidly weakening, and their appearances were also changing rapidly.</p><p>At first, the few members of the evil G.o.d tribe looked middle-aged. However, they were now looking younger and younger. They started to look like young men, and then they looked like teenagers…</p><p>At the same time, their cultivation was also declining.</p><p>In the beginning, it was the heavenly Emperor realm, then the great emperor realm, the true Emperor realm,</p><p>the void Emperor realm, and finally, it fell back to the martial sage realm.</p><p>This was an extremely terrifying divinc ability that could turn back time for the enemy and return them to when their cultivation base was still weak.</p><p>To bubbles, martial sages could be killed with a flip of her hand.</p><p>Bubbles pressed down with her small hands, and a few evil G.o.d tribe members turned into ashes.</p><p>Just like that, a few heavenly Emperor stage evil G.o.d race members were killed by bubbles.</p><p>After bubbles reached the heavenly Emperor stage, her abilities became more and more wondrous. Her combat strength grew stronger and stronger. No one of the same level as her was a match for her.</p><p>At this moment, on the other side, Huang Ling, Long Chen, Huang Li and the others were in danger.</p><p>They formed a formation and attacked the evil G.o.d race continuously. Naturally, they attracted the attention of the other party.</p><p>There were already some short evil G.o.d race members who had their eyes on them.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi ….</p><p>The terrifyingly sharp Saber Light suddenly slashed towards Huang Ling and the others with shocking power. “Not good, it’s a heavenly Emperor realm powerhouse!”</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Although they were all at the peak of the great emperor realm, they were still far from the heavenly Emperor</p><p>realm.</p><p>They formed a large formation and worked together. A huge shield was formed and blocked above.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A sharp, car-piercing sound rang out as the blade light struck the shield. Cracks immediately appeared on the shield before it exploded.</p><p>“Go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>In s.p.a.ce, a short evil G.o.d tribe member appeared. His face was ferocious and filled with killing intent. The weapons in his four arms slashed towards Huang Ling and the others once again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!’</p><p>die! Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others roared and attacked with all their might. They used their trump cards. However, they were still too far away from the heavenly Emperor. Moreover, this short and small evil G.o.d race member was not an ordinary one-star heavenly Emperor, but a two-star heavenly Emperor,</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Explosions rang out continuously as the attacks of Huang Ling and the others were destroyed by the short evil G.o.d race. The incomparably sharp Saber Light continued to slash towards them, wanting to kill them. At this moment, the cry of a Phoenix rang out. Huang Ling’s entire body was bathed flames, and she seemed to have turned into an undying celestial Phoenix. She soared up into the sky and pounced toward the evil G.o.d tribe’s celestial Thearch’s attack.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of Long Chen, Huang Ling, Lu Xiangxiang, and the others changed drastically.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Huang Ling was. .h.i.t. Her body llew over and turned back into human form.</p><p>Her delicate body was almost cut in half, but there was a layer of mysterious aura on her body. Her body was</p><p>quickly recovering.</p><p>It was the indestructible ancient, scroll!</p><p>When Lu Ming first obtained the indestructible ancient scroll, it was a trace of the heaven’s path mark left by</p><p>the undying venerable Emperor. When his cultivation was still weak, he could not inscribe it at all and he could</p><p>not pa.s.s it on to others.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming came out of netherworld mountain, his cultivation level was high enough to inscribe</p><p>it.</p><p>Lu Ming inscribed the indestructible ancient scroll and sent bubbles to dandan, Feng Ling, Long Chen, Lu</p><p>Xiangxiang…</p><p>As long</p><p>they were on good terms with Lu Ming, he would pa.s.s on the indestructible ancient scroll to them</p><p>just so that they could face this great battle.</p><p>Everyone had cultivated the indestructible ancient scroll for hundreds of years, and they were already</p><p>well-versed in it.</p><p>Furthermore, Huang Ling had consumed the fruit of life before. The medicinal effects of the fruit of life still remained in her blood. Although she was severely injured, she was not dead yet and was recovering rapidly. you’re a great emperor, but you’re still alive after being hit by me. Let’s see how many moves you can take!</p><p>The short evil G.o.d race member was stunned at first, but he revealed a ferocious killing intent and was about to attack Huang Ling and the others again.</p><p>However, just as he was about to make a move, he realized that he could not move his body.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Ie roared before his body exploded into ashes. A figure appeared behind him and it was bubbles.</p><p>‘Bubble…</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and the others were overjoyed to see the bubbles.</p><p>“Let’s join forces…” Said Pao Pao, She then joined forces with Huang Ling, Lu Xiangxiang and the rest to fight the alien races,</p><p>On the other side of the battlefield, the fighting was even more intense.</p><p>This kind of short and small evil G.o.d race was simply too fast. They flickered within the Army, and the heaven</p><p>realm experts were constantly being killed.</p><p>Fortunately, there were also heavenly Emperor realm Masters who were good at speed and a.s.sa.s.sination in</p><p>the heaven realm. They arrived in time and killed each other.</p><p>The helmsmen of both sides saw all of this.</p><p>The evil G.o.d World, the non-human race’s divine ancestor, and the various Kings all saw bubble’s</p><p>performance.</p><p>IImph, another s.p.a.ce-time spirit mouse.
