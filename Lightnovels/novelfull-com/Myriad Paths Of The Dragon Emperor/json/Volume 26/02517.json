As long as you make a breakthrough in your cultivation, the seal in the scroll will be opened. Not only will it contain master’s cultivation technique, but it will also contain some information about master’s enemies!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Boy, you look very disappointed. You really don’t know how lucky you are. Do you know how envious I am?”</p><p>“Do you know how profound the word ‘battle’ you obtained is? What kind of background does he have? That’s the ancient word “origin,” do you understand? If it were in the prehistoric universe, I’m afraid countless terrifying existences would fight each other to the death!”</p><p>White teeth cried out, his eyes filled with envy.</p><p>“Ancient word of origin?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to be dumbfounded. He realized that he could not understand what Bai Ya was saying.</p><p>forget it. You won’t understand even if I say so much. Remember, when you travel in the primeval universe in the future, you must try not to expose the secret of this ‘battle character formula’. Otherwise, it will bring you a fatal disaster!</p><p>also, the ‘battle’ character that you comprehended before is only one- millionth, no, one-billionth of the original ancient character. Therefore, you should study this ‘battle’ character more in the future. The benefits it will bring you are unimaginable!</p><p>this ‘battle’ character was discovered by master by accident. He hasn’t comprehended it much, so others don’t know about it at all. Otherwise, those guys wouldn’t have left behind an inheritance!</p><p>White teeth said a bunch of things.</p><p>Lu Ming did not seem to understand. He could only remember everything in his heart.</p><p>“Also, this is for you!”</p><p>A storage ring appeared in Bai Ya’s hand and he threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming received it and was overjoyed.</p><p>A storage ring. There should be some treasures inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual senses probed into it. The next moment, Lu Ming revealed a look of disappointment.</p><p>The items in the storage ring were very simple.</p><p>There was a sword and a huge wooden box.</p><p>With a single thought, the combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“This weapon…”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and then channeled the world Energy into it. He immediately felt that this combat sword was like a bottomless pit. There was a strong devouring power that was frantically devouring the world Energy in his body. Lu Ming was so frightened that he quickly cut off the connection between him and the combat sword.</p><p>It was so terrifying. Lu Ming felt that if this combat sword were to burst out, its power would be many times stronger than the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>this is a divine weapon, a weapon specially used by a martial God. With your current cultivation, you can’t control it at all. Its energy will be sucked dry. You can use it when you have a breakthrough in your cultivation!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“A divine artifact!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He finally knew the name of the martial God’s special weapon.</p><p>This was because both sides had used weapons of this level in the battle between the ancestral Dragon and the divine ancestor.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Such a weapon was a priceless treasure. Lu Ming kept it back into his storage ring and took out the wooden box. When he opened it, a strong medicinal fragrance immediately assailed his nose.</p><p>In the wooden boxes were many crystal clear fruits. The life essence was shockingly rich.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He felt that the medicinal fragrance emitted by the fruit was very similar to that of the life-or-death pill. However, it was much richer, this is a life fruit!</p><p>Bai Ya explained, ” the fruit tree of Life on the netherworld Island will bear fruit once in a long period of time. However, for you outsiders, the myriad tribulation will only come once. Therefore, I’ve collected the fruits that bear at other times. There are a total of 180 fruits of life here. They are quite effective. You can take them!</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating wildly.</p><p>The fruits of life, and 180 at that.</p><p>Overjoyed. Lu Ming was truly overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored Bai Ya’s ‘not bad1.</p><p>Not only was the medicinal effect pretty good, it was simply a Supreme treasure.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen the effects of the life-or-death pill before. The injuries that the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm could not recover from even after countless years had mostly been healed in a few days.</p><p>The fruit of life was even more effective. The ancestral Dragon and the nonhuman divine ancestors had fought so hard for the fruit of life.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had obtained 180 of them at once.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly closed the lid of the wooden box and kept it.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and satisfied. He had gained a lot this time.</p><p>alright, I’ve explained and given you what I should. Now, I’ll send you out!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“How do we get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s a boat on one side of the netherworld Island. You can take the boat and leave directly. I’ll send a message to everyone on the island immediately!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“Senior, wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out hurriedly.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>White teeth asked.</p><p>“Senior, are there any three-eyed people on this Island?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. There’s even a martial God among them!</p><p>White tooth said.</p><p>“Senior, can you kill that three-eyed martial God?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. If they could kill the divine ancestor of the non-human race, everything would be solved.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>no! Bai Ya shook his head, we’ve been sealed here and are under many restrictions. We can’t help you kill!</p><p>those people are your enemies, right? it’s better for you to deal with them yourself. If you can11 even deal with such weak enemies, how are you going to face stronger enemies in the future? how are you going to avenge master? ” After saying that, Bai Ya’s figure moved and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply speechless.</p><p>Weak?</p><p>That was the war god, and he was weak!</p><p>Lu Ming finally realized that his values and thoughts were completely different from Bai Ya’s. There was no way to compare them.</p><p>Not long after white tooth left, he returned.</p><p>“Alright, I’ve already spread the news. I’ll send you out now!”</p><p>With that, Bai Ya waved his hand and Lu Ming disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared on a mountain peak.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming appeared, he saw a few people flying in one direction in the distance.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qing Cang was overjoyed to see Lu Ming and flew over.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, let’s go. Senior ancestral Dragon has gathered us!”</p><p>Qing Cang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Qing Cang and the rest in a certain direction.</p><p>Not long after, they met up not far from the fruit of life.</p><p>“Little Qing, dan dan…”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Xie nianqing and dandan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
