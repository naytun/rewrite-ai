Ile looked at Lu Ming with interest and said, You’re the number one heaven’s favorite in your world?”</p><p>that’s right. You don’t look too old. Do you dare to accept my challenge?’</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“How long have you been cultivating? If you cultivate for too long, you won’t be qualified to be my opponent!”</p><p>Kang long said arrogantly.</p><p>‘I’ve been cultivating for over eight thousand years!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, deliberately with arrogance.</p><p>Ile had heard from the ancestral Dragon that anyone who had cultivated for less than 10000 years in the primeval universe would be considered a talent of the younger generation. Therefore, he said 8000 years on purpose.</p><p>you’ve cultivated for 8000 years to reach this level of cultivation. Not bad. Alright, I’ll play a few moves with you!</p><p>Kang long said arrogantly as he stepped forward.</p><p>He was very curious about the abilities of a prodigy from a small chiliocosm. He was a prodigy himself and naturally wanted to test Lu Ming’s skills.</p><p>young master, don’t take the risk…</p><p>One of the burly men said worriedly.</p><p>“What did you just say? Risk? Are you looking down on me, thinking that I will lose to a native from a small chiliocosm?</p><p>Kang long stopped in his tracks. His eyes were cold as he looked at the burly man. His face was dark.</p><p>The burly man’s expression changed and his back was covered in cold sweat. He knelt down in fear and said, young master, young master, I didn’t mean it that way. I didn’t mean it that way. Please spare my life, young master…</p><p>Kang long was the son of the hall Master of the origin Luo Palace. He was very talented and doted on. Otherwise, the entire planet of the underworld wouldn’t be his territory.</p><p>Moreover, Kang long was cruel and merciless. Anyone who made him unhappy would die.</p><p>It would be strange if he wasn’t scared to death!</p><p>‘I’ve been cultivating for more than five hundred years and I’ve already reached the demiG.o.d realm. My combat strength can kill a first-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. Do you really think that an Aboriginal from a small world can harm me?”</p><p>Kang long spoke again, his voice even colder.</p><p>no, no, how can this be? young master’s divine power is unparalleled, and he’s a peerless heaven’s favorite. How can this native be young master’s opponent?”</p><p>yes, yes, yes. I bet that this native can’t withstand three moves from young master. No, one move will be cnough!</p><p>The others all spoke up and started to flatter him.</p><p>Only then did Kang Long’s face look a little better.</p><p>“You guys step back a little, don’t get in the way!”</p><p>Kang long waved his hand.</p><p>The others could only retreat.</p><p>From their point of view, Lu Ming was only at the transformation void martial stage. Moreover, an Aboriginal from a small chiliocosm posed no threat to Kang long at all. They were not worried about this.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>He had achieved his goal!</p><p>As long as these people looked down on him, he would challenge Kang long and take him as a hostage. Only then would he have a chance of survival.</p><p>He put on an act and Kang long fell for it.</p><p>At the same time, he was secretly shocked.</p><p>Kang long had only cultivated for about 500 years, and he had already reached the demiG.o.d realm. In the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm, this was an unbelievable thing,</p><p>He had cultivated for less than 500 years, but he was different. He couldn’t be explained by common sense. In terms of true cultivation, he wasn’t even a demiG.o.d.</p><p>In addition, people like Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and dandan couldn’t be judged with common sense.</p><p>On the other hand, Kang long was able to cultivate to the demiG.o.d realm in 500 years. This kind of talent was extremely shocking. Moreover, he said that his combat strength could rival a first level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>The primeval universe was indeed not something that the heaven realm, the primordial realm, or the evil G.o.d Realm could compare to. The moment Lu Ming came out, he met a powerful heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Kid, let’s do it. Let me see what you can do, a native from a small chiliocosm.”</p><p>Kang long stepped forward, not far from Lu Ming, his face full of pride.</p><p>ROOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. However, he did not use the path of domination. Instead, he simply relied on his physical strength and threw a punch.</p><p>“What a stable s.p.a.ce!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the difference when he threw a punch.</p><p>The power of his physical body was equivalent to that of a peak heavenly Emperor. If he were in the heaven realm, primordial realm, or evil G.o.d Realm, the s.p.a.ce would collapse into picces with one punch. But now, he found that the s.p.a.ce was extremely stable, and not even a ripple was produced.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Kang long smiled disdainfully and threw a punch as well. Ilis fist was covered with a thin layer of divine power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their fists collided heavily. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying backward, spurting out a</p><p>mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How can he be the number one heaven’s favorite in a small chiliocosm with such strength? Small world, you’re really a native, Country b.u.mpkin, I’ll cripple you now and take you back to refine medicine!”</p><p>Kang Long’s contempt grew. He waved his hand and attacked Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>When the rest of the people saw that Lu Ming had been beaten to the point of vomiting blood by Kang long in one move, they immediately relaxed.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming was indeed an ordinary transformation void martial artist. He was no match for Kang long,</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist and pretended to be defeated. In fact, he was secretly activating the battle formula.</p><p>Kang Long’s cultivation was at the demiG.o.d realm and his combat power was indeed very strong. He far surpa.s.sed the demiG.o.ds that. Lu Ming had encountered. In the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the</p><p>evil G.o.d Realm, no other demiG.o.d could compare to him. It was not a lie for him to say that he could fight with a first-level virtual G.o.d.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming wanted to trigger the doubling of combat strength. This way, he could subdue Kang long in one fell swoop before the others could react.</p><p>“Hahaha, brat, kneel down and beg for mercy. Perhaps I can show you mercy and spare your life…”</p><p>Kang long laughed arrogantly as his attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The double combat power of the battle formula had been triggered!</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a strange smile.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming retaliated. He stretched out his hand and the way of the Dominator burst forth, crushing Kang Long’s attack. He grabbed Kang Long’s wrist and shook hard.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Kang Long’s body trembled like a sieve, his bones breaking inch by inch. At the same time, Lu Ming grabbed Kang Long’s neck. Kang long was like a pool of mud, unable to move at all.</p><p>All of this happened in the time it took for a spark to fly off a piece of Flint. By the time the others realized it,</p><p>it was already too late.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Kid, what are you doing? Let go of the young master!’</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The others roared in anger and exploded with a shocking aura.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. The two burly men and the elder behind Kang long were definitely at least</p><p>fourth-tier void G.o.d Realm. They were extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Take one step forward and he’ll die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The path of domination had enveloped Kang long. With a single thought, Kang long</p><p>would die.</p><p>Those people stopped in their tracks, not daring to move forward.</p><p>“Kid, lowly barbarian, let me go, now!”</p><p>Kang long roared.</p><p>He naturally understood now that Lu Ming had been pretending. He had pretended to be weak so that he could take advantage of the situation to trap him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
