You carry the hope of the heaven realm on your back. I really hope that you can get out. of this danger!</p><p>Song mo smiled.</p><p>*Senior, how can I break the restriction on your body? Junior has mastered the Dao of a sovereign and might be able to help break the restriction!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>&Nbsp; his Dao of domination was extremely profound and might work.</p><p>“You’ve actually mastered the Dao of a ruler?”</p><p>Song mo was shocked.</p><p>Even in the primal universe, there weren’t many people who had mastered the Dao of a ruler. Every single one of them was a peerless genius.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually control such power.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good, you really are the hope of the heaven realm!”</p><p>Song mo laughed out loud, her face was full of smiles. After a while, song mo said, however, your cultivation is too low. The scal on my body was personally placed by the hall Master of the origin Luo Palace. Even if you have mastered the ruler’s Dao, I’m afraid you’ll have to wait until you reach the true G.o.d Realm before you can remove our seal!</p><p>“True G.o.d Realin?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Indeed, it was not that simple.</p><p>If it was that simple, then the ancestor of technique would probably be able to help them resolve it in secret.</p><p>“Go, but be careful. I’ll find a way to lure away some of the people from the yuan Luo Palace nearby!”</p><p>Song mo said.</p><p>‘Senior, Lu Ming will remember your kindness today. If Lu Ming manages to escape danger, I’ll definitely come back to save you in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, his gaze determined.</p><p>“Alright, I believe you!”</p><p>Song mo smiled.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used his movement technique and turned into a ray of light, leaving the place.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, song mo destroyed all traces of the crime scene and left the place.</p><p>After flying for some distance, Lu Ming landed on the ground and ran along the ground. After all, he would be a big target if he flew in the air.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not have a fixed direction. He would head East and West at times, zigzagging in order to avoid being detected by the people from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>Although it would be slower, it was at least safe.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the map given by song mo and headed towards the stellar iron mine.</p><p>The people from the yuanluo Palace could only capture Lu Ming’s approximate location with the crystal ball. They could not pinpoint his exact location.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was moving at a high speed and his direction was constantly changing, it was more difficult for the other party to capture his precise position.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not encounter any experts from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>However, the area of the shadowed star was too large. Lu Ming’s speed was slow to begin with. It took him more than two months to reach the vicinity of the stellar iron minc.</p><p>It was getting closer and closer to the one-year period. There were less than eight months left.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming was even more careful.</p><p>This was because there was a terrifying expert in the stellar iron mine. Without a doubt, there was definitely an existence above seventh-level void G.o.d Realm. Lu Ming did not dare to be careless.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and approached the stellar iron ore carefully, planning to check out the situation. This area was an endless mountain range. There were huge mountains everywhere that reached into the clouds. Lu Ming hid in one of the mountains and looked into the distance.</p><p>In the distance, there were mountains and a huge mine vein.</p><p>There were many figures mining there, and some experts were patrolling.</p><p>There was nothing unusual!</p><p>senior song mo, the people from the ancestor of technique’s faction came to attack this mine. But now, a few months have pa.s.sed. Are the people from the ancestor of technique still here?”</p><p>“Even if they are, How can I find them? Will they attack again?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>He decided to wait nearby.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming waited near the stellar iron ore. However, he did not stay in one position all the time. Instead,</p><p>he kept changing his position to avoid being discovered by the other party.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed. However, there was no movement all.</p><p>The stellar iron ore had been operating peacefully.</p><p>“Could it be that the ancestor of technique’s people have already left?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Time was getting shorter and shorter.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming changed his direction again and carefully headed to another mountain peak.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a chill in his heart. He could sense that danger was approaching.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body suddenly shifted a hundred meters to the right.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of sword light landed on the spot where Lu Ming had just landed, cutting a deep trench on the ground, “You actually dodged my sword, not bad!”</p><p>A crisp voice was heard. Lu Ming turned around and saw a woman.</p><p>This woman’s skin was like jade, and her facial features were exquisite. She was an absolute beauty.</p><p>She had a thick ponytail and was dressed in martial attire. She held a long sword in her hand and looked rather heroic.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Did the people of the yuanluo Palace find out?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quickly. At the same time, he constantly cast the battle symbol art, hoping to trigger the double combat power of the battle symbol art.</p><p>“A mere transformation void martial stage wants to escape in front of me? stay here!”</p><p>The woman shouted. Her ligure was like a fleeting shadow as she rushed toward Lu Ming. With a wave of her</p><p>long sword, a dazzling sword light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he slashed continuously.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A concentrated explosion sounded. Lu Ming’s arm went numb and he retreated quickly.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>This woman’s cultivation was only at first-tier virtual G.o.d-level, but her divine power was condensed and strong. Her attack power was shocking and she could actually suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>Alter forcing Lu Ming back, the woman charged at him again. She waved her long sword and hundreds of sword lights burst out, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally activated the double combat power of the battle character formula. His combat sword shook and rays of sword light burst out, clashing with the woman.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The speed of their attacks was shockingly fast, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of</p><p>moves.</p><p>After dozens of exchanges, the two were both pushed back hundreds of meters. They were evenly matched.</p><p>“Could it be a genius from the yuanluo Palace?*</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>Now, he had activated the double combat strength of the battle formula. His combat strength was very close to the third level of the void G.o.d Realm, and he could kill people at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm. However, this woman, who was only at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, was able to fight him to a draw. Lu Ming was shocked, but he did not know that the woman’s heart was turmoil.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can be be so powerful?”</p><p>The woman roared in her heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the transformation void martial stage and was far from the void G.o.d stage. However, his combat. strength was so strong that he could fight with her. It was simply unbelievable. “The Dao of a sovereign. The power he controls is actually the Dao of a sovereign. There’s actually a genius on the Dao of a sovereign on shadowed star. I can’t believe the yuan Luo Palace has such a genius. I must get</p><p>rid of him!”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through the woman’s mind. Then, a ruthless look appeared in her eyes. She gritted her teeth, raised her long sword, and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>However, the moment the woman made her move, their expressions changed.</p><p>In the distance, a few beams of light rose from the stellar iron mine.</p><p>It was obvious that the battle here had been discovered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
