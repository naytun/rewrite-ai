It was impossible for them to break through in the heaven realm.</p><p>The heaven realm’s conditions weren’t enough for someone to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm. At most, they could only cultivate to the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>Their Foundation and their comprehension had already reached their limits.</p><p>At this moment, the moment he arrived at the desolate universe, the moment he arrived at the true heavenstar, he had an impulse to break through.</p><p>let’s release them first and settle them down. It won’t be too late to break through after the small world fuses with the primeval universe!</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and a few people who cultivated small worlds released the divine beasts and humans inside.</p><p>People kept appearing on the plain.</p><p>Not long after, a dense crowd of humans and divine beasts appeared. Their numbers were immeasurable.</p><p>This was the entire heaven realm and primordial realm’s people and divine beasts, so their numbers were naturally terrifying.</p><p>However, this plain was really too big. It was more than ten times the size of the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm. It could easily accommodate them.</p><p>everyone, we’re safe. This is the true beavenstar, the primeval universe. We can settle down here and build our city!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang in everyone’s ears.</p><p>“Is this the primal universe? G.o.d, what kind of energy this? It’s much stronger than original Qi!”</p><p>my cultivation feels like it’s about to break through. I’m just taking a breath!</p><p>I feel like I can strengthen my body and achieve a breakthrough in cultivation even if I don’t cultivate in this environment!</p><p>Countless humans and G.o.dly beasts felt the environment here and were extremely shocked.</p><p>The cultivation environment of true sky Star was much better than that of the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>It was like heaven and earth!</p><p>They were right. Even if one didn’t cultivate here, one’s cultivation could still be improved.</p><p>This was especially true for some low-level martial artists. For example, those below the martial Royal realm felt that their cultivation was improving with every breath they took. Their bodies were also being tempered and constantly becoming stronger.</p><p>Their feelings were not wrong!</p><p>In the primeval universe, any creature, regardless of whether they had cultivated or not, could reach the martial Royal realm as long as they were adults.</p><p>In other words, in the primeval universe, any farmer had the cultivation of a Martial Emperor.</p><p>This was the divine realm. It was incomparable to the heaven realm. The environment here was too good. Any living being that stayed here for a long time would automatically evolve in all aspects and transform. Many talented people could easily cultivate to the rank of martial Saint, or martial Supreme.</p><p>Of course, it was not easy to reach the martial G.o.d Realm. This was a barrier that stopped 99% of the creatures in the primeval universe.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s get familiar with each other before we begin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard again.</p><p>Everyone familiarized themselves and got used to it. Then, zu long and the others started to make arrangements. Everyone started build a city on the plain.</p><p>Not long after, a group of experts came from the righteous heaven Army, responsible for the safety of the many creatures in the heaven realm.</p><p>After all, there were some living creatures in this gra.s.sland. Although there were no terrifying existences, any living creature had the cultivation of the martial Royal realm. They were a threat to most of the humans and divine beasts in the heaven realm.</p><p>Following that, countless heaven realm beings began to get busy. One after another, huge and majestic cities were erected on the gra.s.sland.</p><p>At the same time, the righteous heaven Army had formation experts to help them inscribe a formation. This way, as long as they stayed in the city, they would be safe.</p><p>A few months pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye. Countless living beings in the heaven realm settled down on this gra.s.sland.</p><p>Hundreds of huge cities suddenly appeared in this boundless gra.s.sland.</p><p>In the past few months, the cultivation of countless people in the heaven realm had skyrocketed and kept breaking through.</p><p>Especially those with low cultivation, their breakthrough speed was even more shocking.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s parents, Li Ping and Lu Yuntian, had rushed straight into the martial sage realm. Moreover, they were improving every day.</p><p>There were countless living beings in the heaven realm. When they first came to such a place, they were bound to have a period of explosive growth. After their cultivation was high, their growth would be slow.</p><p>It would take much longer for a Martial Emperor to level up. However, there were still many martial emperors who had broken through.</p><p>The lower one’s cultivation level, the easier it was to break through.</p><p>On this day, a series of rumbling sounds came from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“The one year period is up!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>It had been a year since he came to the desolate universe.</p><p>The small world in his body was about to merge with the primeval universe.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and he turned into a ray of light, appearing on an open plain.</p><p>At this moment, countless people rushed out and came to the open plain.</p><p>Like Lu Ming, they cultivated the nomological system and relined small worlds. At this moment, they had to integrate with the desolate universe.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s small world shook more and more violently and then flew out automatically.</p><p>After the small world flew out, it landed on the gra.s.sland and merged with the land. The area of the gra.s.sland was rapidly expanding.</p><p>Lu Ming fell a wave of weakness in his body. This was caused by the fusion of the small world and the primeval universe.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain and river diagram flew out from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows and fused with</p><p>the ground.</p><p>‘As expected, even a Grotto-heaven treasure is no good. I can’t keep it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The nature of Grotto-heaven treasures was the same as small worlds. They were not allowed to exist in the primal universe.</p><p>In the primeval universe, except for some s.p.a.ce secret realms that were born naturally, the small worlds that were man-made and could allow living creatures to live were all not allowed to exist.</p><p>This was how domineering the primeval universe was. It was the only one.</p><p>However, spatial treasures like storage rings were fine.</p><p>This kind of spatial treasure could only open up a s.p.a.ce and store things. Living beings could not survive in it.</p><p>so it was fine.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had stored all the treasures of the mountain and river diagram in his small world.</p><p>In the heaven realm, all the living beings who had cultivated small worlds had merged with the earth.</p><p>IIuala…</p><p>At this moment, an extremely powerful energy poured into Lu Ming’s body. He did not even need to refine it.</p><p>This energy automatically transformed into World Energy and master energy.</p><p>The feeling of weakness disappeared quickly and Lu Ming was filled with energy again.</p><p>This was the feedback from the primal universe.</p><p>The primeval universe was fair. If his small world was taken away, there would be corresponding energy that would be fed back to him.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the world Energy and the ruler’s energy in his body were surging. His total energy did not.</p><p>decrease.</p><p>His cultivation level was still the same as before.</p><p>It was just that the small world had disappeared and turned into the power of the world and the power of domination.</p><p>that’s good. It’ll be easier for me to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>In order to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm, he had to combine all his energy into one.</p><p>Even if the small world did not merge with the primeval universe, he would still have to find a way to merge everything into one in the future. However, that would be more troublesome.</p><p>In this case, it would be more convenient for Lu Ming to break through to the BattleG.o.d realm in the future.</p><p>He would take fewer detours.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
