It was so unbearable that they wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>The auras of the six martial gods were too terrifying.</p><p>If they were to fight, it would probably be earth-shattering.</p><p>The atmosphere at the scene was extremely heavy.</p><p>“How about this…”</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire, Long Yan, looked at the white-haired elder and said, ” elder Huang, if you agree to join hands with us to break through the puppets outside the yellow Springs Island and help them enter the island, we can let these people go!</p><p>Long Yan still wanted to let the divine ancestor and the others enter netherworld Island, as they had already agreed on a 50 – 50 split of the treasures they obtained on the island.</p><p>They couldn’t enter the yellow Springs Island themselves. If they missed this opportunity, they would have to wait for another ten thousand tribulations.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>He also wanted to enter the yellow Springs Island!</p><p>” Lu Ming, what do you think?”</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor, Long Yan, and the others were all very surprised.</p><p>The white-haired elder, a martial God, actually wanted to ask for Lu Ming’s opinion. What was their relationship with Lu Ming?</p><p>agree to their request. However, we must also enter the yellow Springs Island together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This was the only way to save Long Chen and the others.</p><p>alright, let’s join forces. However, they have to enter the yellow Springs Island together!</p><p>The white-haired elder pointed at the ancestral Dragon, Lu Ming, and the rest.</p><p>“Alright, then it’s settled!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor, Long Yan, and the others pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.</p><p>Although they did not want Lu Ming and the rest to enter, they would not be able to enter without the help of the white-haired elder and the rest.</p><p>Now, they could only enter the netherworld Island first. After entering, they would rely on their own abilities.</p><p>as long as I get the fruit of life, killing heart and I will recover from our injuries.</p><p>At that time, let’s see how you guys die!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor thought to himself.</p><p>“Release them!”</p><p>Long Yan ordered.</p><p>Immediately, someone broke the seal for Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others, and everyone regained their freedom.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have saved me again!”</p><p>Long Chen sighed as he came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan Ming smiled sweetly and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>After a brief chat, Lu Ming found out that Long Chen and the rest were exploring some Cursed Lands. When they came out, they were surrounded.</p><p>“Elder Huang, when do we make our move?”</p><p>Long Yan looked at the white-haired old man.</p><p>“One year later!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>This was the time that Lu Ming and the rest had set.</p><p>They needed time to gather the people from the other realms.</p><p>Only when more people entered the yellow Springs Island would they have a higher chance of obtaining an opportunity.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll meet here one year later!”</p><p>Long Yan said. Then, they returned to the capital of the netherworld Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also left the place.</p><p>After that, he met up with the Titan Longhorn and the others, and they arrived at a famous mountain.</p><p>This famous mountain was extremely famous in the yellow Springs world. One only needed to ask a little to know.</p><p>Then, they spread the news and gathered the people of the heaven realm here.</p><p>at the same time, the ancestral Dragon and some other experts personally went to some Cursed Lands to search for people from the heaven realm.</p><p>At the same time, the evil god race also sent out a message to gather the evil god race members that were scattered all over the world to gather at the netherworld imperial capital.</p><p>For a time, the evil god tribe and heaven realm beings that were scattered all over the place gathered toward these two places.</p><p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.</p><p>The living beings of the heaven realm had basically all gathered here. Those who didn’t come were mostly dead.</p><p>Lu Ming did a quick calculation. There were only about a thousand people gathered here.</p><p>When they first entered, there were thousands of people. Now that their numbers had been reduced by half, it was clear how many people had died.</p><p>Once the time was up, they set off for the netherworld imperial capital.</p><p>When they arrived, there were already thousands of people gathered outside the East Gate of the capital.</p><p>Some were from the evil god tribe, and some were from the yellow spring</p><p>Empire.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two sides gathered, and the Dragon flames were the first to fly in one direction.</p><p>The netherworld Island was not in the imperial capital of the netherworld. It was to the South of the capital.</p><p>They flew for a few hours before an abyss appeared in front of them.</p><p>This abyss was extremely wide, and no one knew how long it was.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At the bottom of the abyss, there was the sound of flowing water. Everyone looked at the side and found that the bottom of the abyss was filled with yellow water.</p><p>Yellow spring water!</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Could it be that the netherworld’s water all flowed here?</p><p>the netherworld Island is on the opposite side of this abyss. However, no living creature can cross this abyss. No living creature can fly over it. If they try to fly over it by force, they will fall into the abyss!</p><p>if we want to pass through this abyss, we can only pass through the bridge ahead!</p><p>Long Yan said.</p><p>The group flew along the abyss and saw a stone bridge.</p><p>The stone bridge was very large and wide, and it led to the other side of the abyss.</p><p>However, as they neared, there was a constant flash of light near the stone bridge, and a figure appeared.</p><p>A puppet!</p><p>However, these puppets were all in human form. They wore blood-red battle armor and their eyes were filled with blood-red light.</p><p>is this a puppet of array Dao? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Previously, he had already learned from the white-haired elder and the others that the puppets formed on this stone bridge were formation Dao puppets that were formed by a large formation.</p><p>Even if they were killed or defeated, they would reform after a period of time.</p><p>“Trespassers will be killed!”</p><p>A huge puppet shouted, its aura shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>The martial God Realm!</p><p>This puppet was at the martial God Realm and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>There were three other puppets that weren’t any weaker than this puppet.</p><p>There were a total of four martial God Realm puppets.</p><p>Apart from these four, there were more than a hundred puppets. They were all extremely terrifying and were all at the heavenly Emperor realm and above.</p><p>Everyone’s expression turned grave.</p><p>according to the plan, the four of us will each hold off one Battlegod realm puppet. The two of you will not be at your peak state. You will assist one of us to kill one puppet with all your strength, and then help the others!</p><p>Long Yan looked at the non-human divine ancestor and the ancestral Dragon. The two martial gods of the yellow Springs Empire and the two martial gods of the yellow Springs sect could each hold off one martial God puppet.</p><p>The forefather and the ancestral Dragon worked together to help one of them defeat a martial God puppet.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Elder Huang nodded.</p><p>“Those at the void transformation stage and above, follow me and kill!</p><p>“Those at the void transformation stage and above, attack!”</p><p>Long Yan and old Huang spoke one after the other. Then, they stepped forward and charged toward the puppets.</p><p>“Trespassers will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>A martial God puppet held a long spear and charged toward Long Yan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom suddenly erupted in the area. The battle of the martial gods had begun.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
