A big mouth and a pair of eyes appeared on it. The eyes were only glowing and were staring at the metal beast core in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The metal ball jumped over, opened its mouth, and swallowed the beast core in one gulp. It began to chew on</p><p>After a while, the metal ball finished the metal beast core and looked at Lu Ming eagerly.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few more but they were all finished by the metal ball in a few bites.</p><p>we can’t go on like this. We don’t have that many metal beast cores for it to cat!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>a metal beast core is actually a kind of refining material. I wonder if this guy will eat other metal-attribute relining materials!</p><p>At the thought of this, a piece of refining material appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. II. shone with different colors and was made of metals of different attributes.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming had just taken it out when it was swallowed by the metal ball in one bite. It ate with great relish. “It really ate it. This fellow’s teeth are really good. So, combat weapon, does it eat it?”</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming took out another Emperor-level weapon.</p><p>The metal ball reached out two tentacles and grabbed the Emperor-level weapon. It chewed it into pieces in two or three bites. Then, it shook its round body, as if it was saying that the level of the combat weapon was not high enough and it didn’t have enough taste.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. The next moment, a bow and arrow appeared his hands.</p><p>This was the fallen star bow, an incomplete heavenly Dao soldier. It had given Lu Ming a lot of help when his cultivation level was still weak.</p><p>The metal ball grabbed it, and with two or three cracks, it swallowed it.</p><p>Only then did the metal ball’s eyes reveal a hint of satisfaction.</p><p>I’ll give you a few more!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few more heaven’s path soldiers, including the great desolation spear.</p><p>The great desolation spear had been damaged during the battle with the divine ancestor of the non-human race. Furthermore, to Lu Ming, a heavenly Dao soldier-level weapon was no longer of any use. He could shatter a heavenly Dao soldier with a wave of his hand.</p><p>The metal ball did not reject any of them. It chewed and swallowed the heaven Dao soldiers one by one. After swallowing them, the metal ball emitted a layer of radiance. It then looked at Lu Ming eagerly.</p><p>“This guy’s appet.i.te is too big!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a headache.</p><p>Then, he gritted his teeth and took out two weapons. One was a battle saber and the other was an axe. They were both divine weapons, but they were only level one low-grade divine weapons.</p><p>They were the spoils of war that Lu Ming had obtained from the enemy.</p><p>In the battle of myriad Gold Star, Lu Ming and the rest had each obtained a few divine artifacts. However, the highest was only a level three low-grade divine artifact. They did not obtain any level four low-grade divine artifacts or above.</p><p>When saw the two level one low quality divine artifacts, the metal ball’s eyes lit up, and it grabbed them</p><p>and started to gnaw on them.</p><p>This was a divine artifact. Although it was a level one low-grade divine artifact, its toughness was extraordinary. Even with Lu Ming’s current ability, he would need to put in some effort to destroy it. However, the metal ball could bite off a large piece of it with one bite. It was eating with a ‘fragrant’ sound. The metal ball was slightly slower in eating the divine artifacts. After half an hour, the metal ball finally destroyed the two divine artifacts. Its entire body was glowing, and it had a satisfied expression.</p><p>“This guy, he won’t be eating divine weapons often in the future, right?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>Every divine weapon was expensive. If he continued to cat like this, he would definitely go bankrupt. However, at the thought that this guy would level up if he ate too much, Lu Ming’s heart burned with pa.s.sion. As long as he had enough metal materials and various weapons for the metal ball to eat, it would be able to keep advancing. It would be of great help to him in the future.</p><p>“Let’s eat some low-level food first, I’ll think of a way!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and took out some of the refining materials that he had collected over the years. Over the years, he had collected too many metal forging materials. He had given a portion of them to the Dragon Alliance to forge weapons, but there was still a lot left.</p><p>However, their levels were not high.</p><p>Although he only took out a portion of it, it was still piled up like a small mountain. Seeing so much metal materials, the metal ball’s eyes lit up and it pounced into the pile of refining materials and began to gobble them up.</p><p>For the next half a month, Lu Ming stabilized his realm while observing the situation of the metal ball. In the past half a month, the metal ball had almost finished all the refining materials that Lu Ming had collected. However, the metal ball did not show any signs of advancing.</p><p>it seems that the grade of the materials used is too low. They can’t provide enough energy for the metal ball!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that after the metal ball swallowed the metal material, it would be able to absorb the</p><p>spiritual essence of the metal ball material and improve itself.</p><p>Only by absorbing enough golden essence could it transform and advance.</p><p>The energy contained in low-level blacksmithing materials was too little for the metal ball that was already at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm,</p><p>“What do we do? Don’t tell me you’re going to keep feeding the divine artifact? how can I afford to feed it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If a divine artifact couldn’t afford to feed him, then he would feed him divine artifact fragments.</p><p>In the desolate universe, countless people fought each other every day, and countless people went to various forbidden places, dangerous places, and some unknown planets for adventure.</p><p>They fought and killed each other. Every day, there would be mysterious fragments. When a divine artifact shattered, it would produce mysterious fragments.</p><p>The metal ball only needed the spiritual essence of the metal. In that case, eating a divine artifact shard and eating a divine artifact were essentially the same.</p><p>However, the price of a divine artifact fragment was much cheaper than a divine artifact.</p><p>In fact, the price of a divine artifact fragment was even cheaper than the materials of the same level.</p><p>This was because refining materials could be used directly for refining. However, if one wanted to reuse a mystical fragment, they would have to first extract the materials from the divine artifact fragment.</p><p>However, when refining a divine weapon, all kinds of different materials had been completely intertwined and mixed together. It was very difficult to extract them.</p><p>The cost of labor was also very high, which led to the price of the divine artifact fragments not being very</p><p>high,</p><p>I’ll go and buy divine artifact fragments. Haha!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was overjoyed. He grabbed the metal ball and walked out.</p><p>The metal ball itself was like a ball of liquid metal. At this moment, it squirmed along Lu Ming’s palm and turned into a golden bangle, which Lu Ming wore on his wrist.</p><p>“Not bad, this is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He turned it into a bracelet and wore it on his wrist to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>“I’ll give you a name!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he looked at the ‘bracelet on his wrist.</p><p>A pair of eyes immediately appeared on the bangle, looking at Lu Ming with antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>“You’re round like a ball. I’ll call you QiuQiu, how about that? Isn’t it good enough?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The metal ball blinked its eyes. It seemed to like it.</p><p>‘Dandan, bubble, Qiu Qiu…</p><p>At the thought of dandan, bubbles, and the rest, Lu Ming smiled in his heart. He was quite satisfied with the standard of his own naming.</p><p>Outside, Lu Ming rose into the air. Not long after, he arrived at the place where the righteous sky Army traded treasures.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
