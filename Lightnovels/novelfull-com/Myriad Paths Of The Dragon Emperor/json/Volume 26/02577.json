I’ll set off to save them now. You two, follow me!</p><p>Deputy general sun took Kang long and looked at the two men.</p><p>The two men were at the 8th level of the void G.o.d Realm. They were the two with the highest cultivation apart from Deputy general sun.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them carried Kang long and flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming did not need to care about what happened after that. He believed that Deputy general sun and the rest would definitely have a way to successfully exchange for the people from the righteous sky Army and the interplanetary warship.</p><p>Kang long was the young master of the yuanluo Palace. The people of the palace would not dare to reject the exchange of hostages.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest only had to wait quietly.</p><p>In less than a day, Deputy general sun and the others returned with more than 20 other people.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Deputy general sun and the rest had succeeded!</p><p>“Let’s go, we have to leave the underworld star. The people of the origin Luo Palace will definitely hunt us down!”</p><p>Deputy general sun said. With a wave of his hand, a small boat appeared in s.p.a.ce.</p><p>The shape of the boat was very strange. It did not look like a boat, but rather similar to the s.p.a.ce-breaking shuttle that. Lu Ming had seen in the yuan continent. Both ends were pointed, forming the shape of a shuttle. It was pitch-black in color and had strange runes carved all over its surface.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that this was probably an interplanetary warship, a warship that could travel in the universe. Lu Ming’s heart was burning.</p><p>The price of such a warship would definitely be astonishingly high.</p><p>This was because true G.o.ds could only stay in the universe for a short period of time. They were unable to cross the universe.</p><p>Only sky Celestials had the ability to travel across the starry sky, from one planet to another. From this, it could be seen how precious this kind of starry sky battleship was.</p><p>If he could have one, he would be able to travel freely in the universe.</p><p>As soon as the interplanetary warship appeared in the sky, it expanded rapidly.</p><p>“All of you, come in!”</p><p>Deputy general sun said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzard! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Everyone’s figures flickered as they rushed into the interplanetary warship.</p><p>Deputy general sun was the last to enter. After he entered the starry sky battleship, the starry sky battleship turned into a rainbow light and shot into the sky at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The starry sky battleship shot into s.p.a.ce like a beam of light. Very quickly, it broke through the atmosphere and headed towards the outer s.p.a.ce.</p><p>On the walls of the Starship, there were pieces of transparent crystals. Through the crystals, one could see the outside.</p><p>Lu Ming looked outside through the crystal. He could see that the land behind him was shrinking. Very soon,</p><p>a Blue Planet appeared below.</p><p>“Is this the dark underworld star?”</p><p>It was the first time that he saw a planet in front of him. Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>In the heaven realm, such a wondrous scene could not be seen.</p><p>The huge underworld star was spinning slowly in the universe. In Lu Ming’s vision, smaller.</p><p>became smaller and</p><p>one day, I’ll come back to the dark underworld star. One day, I’ll take back the heaven realm and the primordial realm!</p><p>“Senior song mo and the other seniors from the heaven realm, I will set you free one day. The yuanluo Palace has treated the people of the heaven realm as medicinal herbs. One day, I will flatten the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly swore in his heart. His eyes were determined.</p><p>The underworld star became smaller and smaller in Lu Ming’s eyes. In the end, it became a small black dot and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at other places and sighed in his heart.</p><p>Beautiful, too beautiful!</p><p>The starry sky in the universe was simply too beautiful. The stars were dazzling.</p><p>And they were currently travelling through the universe.</p><p>the primeval universe is the real world. It’s vast and boundless!</p><p>Looking at the starry sky, Lu Ming felt his heart open.</p><p>The heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm were still too small. They were only small chiliocosm and could not be compared to the primeval universe.</p><p>The primeval universe was too vast and boundless. There were countless races and experts.</p><p>Those Legend rank experts were able to roam the universe freely and were immortal.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt a sense of pride in his heart. He felt his blood boiling.</p><p>One day, he would also become an expert who could dominate the universe!</p><p>Although he was still far away now, when Lu Ming had just started cultivating, he was still far away from being a peak expert in the heaven realm. But in the end, Lu Ming still achieved it.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that the desolate universe would be more exciting than the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>Now, they were going to the headquarters of the righteous heavenly Army, the righteous Heavenly Star! The underworld star was very far away from the true heavenstar.</p><p>One could imagine that the surface area of a single dark underworld star was 10000 times larger than the total surface area of the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, the underworld star was just a speck of dust in the universe.</p><p>One could only imagine how great the distance between different planets was!</p><p>Even if the speed of an interplanetary warship was amazing, it would still take several months to travel.</p><p>In the starry sky battleship, Lu Ming would occasionally cultivate and chat with Tong Xi ‘er and Deputy general sun.</p><p>He had also learned a lot about the common knowledge of the desolate universe.</p><p>At the same time, when the people of the righteous Army found out that. Lu Ming came from a small chiliocosm and was from the same hometown as the general of the righteous Army, their att.i.tude towards Lu Ming changed completely. They treated Lu Ming as one of their own.</p><p>A few months pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A huge planet appeared in front of them.</p><p>This planet was the true heavenstar!</p><p>True heaven star was named after the true heaven Army occupied this place, so it was naturally not called</p><p>this before.</p><p>“What a huge planet!”</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming could feel that the true heavenstar was astonishingly huge. Its size was at least a few</p><p>times larger than the shadowed star. It gave a strong visual impact.</p><p>The Starship slowed down and slowly approached true sky Star,</p><p>Slowly, Lu Ming could see mountains, rivers, and even huge cities on the true heavenstar.</p><p>Not long after, they entered the atmosphere of true sky Star. At this time, Deputy general sun put away the interplanetary warship, and they appeared in the air.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and felt that the divine Qi here was extremely rich.</p><p>was more than twice as</p><p>rich as on the underworld star.</p><p>Such a cultivation environment was simply too good.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Deputy general sun took the lead and flew toward a mountain peak.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed.</p><p>This mountain peak was extremely wide, and on top of it, there were many palaces that were majestic and</p><p>magnificent!</p><p>Between the mountain peaks, experts were constantly flying around.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. At a glance, he could see that most of the city’s virtual G.o.d-level existences were there. There were only a few below virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also understood that this should be the headquarters of the righteous Army. There would naturally be many experts here. There would definitely not be so many experts in other places.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a square.</p><p>“Xi ‘er, bring Lu Ming to the living room and wait. I’ll report to the general. He’ll be very happy to know that a</p><p>fellow villager has come!”</p><p>Deputy general sun said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er nodded, then looked at. Lu Ming and said, “Lu Ming, come with me. Let’s go to the living room!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Tong Xi ‘cr.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
