They clearly remembered how difficult it was to deal with the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat in the ancient battle.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat back then was only a peak heavenly Emperor, but ordinary peak heavenly emperors were no match for it at all. Even demiG.o.ds would find it difficult to kill the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat’s life-saving ability was too strong. They had to use a few demiG.o.ds to kill the s.p.a.ce-time spirit. rat.</p><p>They heaved a sigh of relief when they realized that bubbles ‘cultivation base had yet to reach its peak. s.p.a.ce-time spirit rats are one of the few races in the world that come from the outside world. They have a great origin and are very amazing. They haven’t exerted their potential at all, or they would be even more terrifying!</p><p>send all the heavenly Emperor-level powerhouses to the battlefield. I want this s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat alive! The non-human divine ancestor said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Someone received the order and spread the news.</p><p>Immediately, be it the returning ruins battlefield or the two world city battlefield, the heavenly Emperor powerhouses of the evil G.o.d tribe began to set off.</p><p>Returning ruins city and two world city, the evil G.o.d race sent out 5000 celestial thearchs each. They flew towards the battlefield, and their auras were so strong that they shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>Those were heavenly emperors. There were five thousand heavenly emperors on each battlefield. What kind of concept was this?</p><p>The evil G.o.d tribe had acc.u.mulated for countless years before they had so many heavenly Emperor existences.</p><p>On the edge of the lair of Zulong.</p><p>the evil G.o.d tribe’s celestial Thearch has already appeared. Pa.s.s down my order, let the celestial Thearch fight!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon gave the order.</p><p>The order was quickly pa.s.sed down, and suddenly, almost all the heavenly Emperor powerhouses from the heaven realm went to battle.</p><p>The sinkhole city was filled with divine beast powerhouses. One after another, terrifying and Savage divine beasts stomped through the void and charged toward the evil G.o.d clan’s celestial Thearch.</p><p>The celestial emperors of both sides began an even more intense battle in the sky.</p><p>On the heaven realm’s side, the number of experts cultivating in the lair of Zulong was astonishing, especially the divine beasts. After all, the Zulong was a true dragon.</p><p>Therefore, the strength of the divine beasts in the heaven realm was still stronger.</p><p>However, with the addition of the prison realm, the human race’s strength skyrocketed.</p><p>Therefore, the battle in two world city was fought by the human race and the prison realm.</p><p>On the two world city battlefield, all of the human race’s celestial thearchs had also joined the battle. They were fighting fiercely with the evil G.o.d race’s celestial Thearch in the sky above the battlefield. The battle was so intense that the heavens and earth cracked and the sun and moon dimmed.</p><p>This was a b.l.o.o.d.y ma.s.sacre. The battlefield seemed to have turned into a purgatory.</p><p>This was a truc decisive battle that would determine the fate of one side. No one would be soft-hearted, and no one would hold back. Everyone only had one goal, and that was to kill their opponent.</p><p>There were many familiar figures in the Army of the celestial Thearch.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu, heavenly venerate six sages, Archean body cultivators, Thunder one, Earth One, and so on.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A white-haired elder howled. He was covered in blood as he fought with a tall evil G.o.d.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize the elder. He was the patriarch of the LAN family, a four-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, the evil G.o.d race member that he was fighting against did not have a weak cultivation base. The two of them were bathed in blood as they fought, and they exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the end, the LAN family’s old ancestor crushed the head of the evil G.o.d race member with a single palm strike. However, before the evil G.o.d race member died, he also slashed out with his axe, splitting the LAN family’s old ancestor into two.</p><p>Perishing together!</p><p>“Water one!”</p><p>On the other side, Lei Yi let out a furious roar. Water one had been killed. He had been blasted into pieces in the air by a royal member of the evil G.o.d tribe.</p><p>“A group of puppets, die!”</p><p>The Royal clan of the evil G.o.d tribe was extremely powerful and had the cultivation base of a five-star</p><p>heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Just as he was about to charge at Lei Yi and the others, a sword light suddenly flashed, and the body of the Royal member of the evil G.o.d tribe froze. Then, with a bang, he was split into several pieces and died on the</p><p>spot.</p><p>A middle-aged man with a cold expression appeared.</p><p>“Xuan Luo!””</p><p>Lei Yi recognized this person.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize that this person was the patriarch of Xuan Feng, Xuan</p><p>Xiang, and the others.</p><p>Obviously, his injuries had healed and he had the cultivation base of a peak heavenly Emperor,</p><p>Xuan Luo’s expression was cold as he charged forward. However, one of the peak heavenly emperors from the evil G.o.d race had his eyes on him, and the two of them started fighting.</p><p>There were people dying continuously.</p><p>Heavenly emperors and great emperors were usually powerful experts, but now, they were worthless as they</p><p>died in battle.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor and the ancestral Dragon were all watching the battle closely,</p><p>senior, I’m afraid that the outsiders will not send the same number of troops to both the battlefield of the</p><p>ruins of end and the battlefield of two world city. I reckon that the other party will feign an attack on one of</p><p>the battlefields while their real main force will attack one of the battlefields and then break them down one by</p><p>one!</p><p>A demiG.o.d suggested to the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>yes, that’s what I think too. I just don’t know which battlefield they are targeting!</p><p>Zu long nodded.</p><p>Their faces were all very serious.</p><p>This was because they knew that the main force of the evil G.o.d tribe had yet to make a move.</p><p>Those demiG.o.ds and a terrifying Army from ancient times, the sky breaking Army. This Army was said to be able to trample through the heavenly realm and was extremely terrifying,</p><p>Furthermore, neither the non-human divine ancestor nor the sacred ancestor bloodheart had made a move. This battle was very disadvantageous for them.</p><p>The battle continued, and in the blink of an eye, it had been intense for half an hour.</p><p>Evil G.o.d World!</p><p>the nine of you, attack the city of returning ruins together and lure out the demiG.o.ds from the heaven realm!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor looked at the non-human Kings.</p><p>However, he looked at the current king tier. Other than the first king tier, there were nine other people.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The nine Kings accepted the order and tore through the void, hurrying to the battlefield of the ruins of end.</p><p>The returning ruins battlefield, on the ground or in the air, were the battlefields below the celestial Thearch level. The true dragon, Phoenix, Qilin and the other powerful races had set up formations fight the giant</p><p>beard race.</p><p>The two sides were locked in battle.</p><p>High up in the sky was the battlefield of the celestial emperors,</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Suddenly, a s.p.a.ce split open, and an extremely terrifying sword light slashed out toward the true Dragon’s</p><p>battle formation.</p><p>This true dragon battle formation was formed by at least 10000 true dragons. They transformed into a huge true dragon and fought with a giant beard tribe being.</p><p>At this moment, the sword light slashed down, causing the true dragons expressions to change.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Ten thousand true dragons roared and formed a huge formation. They extended a huge Dragon Claw and</p><p>grabbed at the sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a terrifying explosion, the huge Dragon Claw was cut off. The hundreds of true dragons that had laid down this Dragon Claw were killed in an instant.</p><p>The entire formation also crumbled, and tens of thousands of true dragons retreated, many</p><p>them spitting</p><p>out blood.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The s.p.a.ce cracked open, and a figure appeared. He held a sword in his hand and wore a crown on his head.</p><p>He exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Not good, it’s the opponent’s King!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>This evil G.o.d King was extremely cold. With his sword in hand, he once again slashed out at the 10000 true</p><p>dragons.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>In the distance, a roar sounded, and a Golden Dragon Claw suddenly appeared and grabbed at the</p><p>non-human King.</p><p>The non-human king’s sword clashed with the Golden Dragon Claw, causing the s.p.a.ce around it to explode.</p><p>The next moment, a golden true dragon appeared in the air. It also gave off a terrifying aura that wasn’t any</p><p>weaker than a non-human King,</p><p>Swipe left to continue &gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
