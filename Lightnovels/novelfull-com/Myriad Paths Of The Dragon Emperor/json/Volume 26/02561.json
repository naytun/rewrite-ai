Then, with a flash, a strange living being appeared in the sky.</p><p>This creature was in the form of a human, but it had long blood-red hair and sharp fangs in its mouth. On its back, there was a pair of blood-red Wings.</p><p>It looked like a human-shaped bat.</p><p>human, the flesh and blood of divine beasts are too delicious, too delicious!</p><p>The human-shaped bat creature licked its lips, revealing an intoxicated expression as well as a deep desire for blood.</p><p>His spiritual sense spread out and instantly covered the entire northern region of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>“Hahaha, so many humans and G.o.dly beasts. This ‘farm’ is not bad. I’ll enjoy it first!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat sneered. He took a step forward, and in the next moment, he appeared in the sky above a huge city.</p><p>This giant city was a famous giant city in the northern region of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>The total number of humans and G.o.dly beasts in this giant city was more than 100 million, and there were several major forces living there.</p><p>“Hahaha, become my food and replenish my energy!”</p><p>The humanoid bat. laughed sinisterly as his body rapidly grew to a hundred thousand fleet tall, and his terrifying aura spread in all directions.</p><p>“My G.o.d, what is that?”</p><p>“What a terrifying aura!”</p><p>The beings in the city were all stunned when they discovered the human-shaped bat. The aura of the bat was Loo terrifying.</p><p>divine might! That’s divine might! He’s a G.o.d!</p><p>In the huge city, a heavenly Emperor cried out in horror,</p><p>“G.o.d?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Now, in the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm, apart from zu long and Lu Ming, were there any other G.o.ds?</p><p>“Not good, go, quickly go!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted and rushed out of the city.</p><p>They thought of what the ancestral Dragon had said, that the creatures of the universe would attack the heaven realm.</p><p>But now, a G.o.d had appeared out of thin air. It must have come from beyond the heavens.</p><p>“You want to leave? where can you go in front of me?”</p><p>The human-shaped bat laughed sinisterly. He grabbed forward with his huge hand, covering the sky and covering the earth. There were thousands of humans and divine beasts that had escaped. He grabbed them and stuffed them into his b.l.o.o.d.y mouth, chewing them.</p><p>Blood flowed out of the bat’s fangs.</p><p>“Delicious, it’s really delicious! Hahaha!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat laughed.</p><p>When he came in from the primeval universe, even with the protection of the bead, he was still injured. Now, he could devour these human G.o.dly beasts to heal his injuries.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, thousands of people were swallowed, including a heavenly Emperor expert. The people in the giant city panicked and began to flee.</p><p>hahaha, become my delicacy. The benefits of this job are too good!</p><p>The human-shaped bat laughed loudly. It opened its b.l.o.o.d.y mouth and swallowed. A terrifying attractive force crupted, and countless people in the giant city involuntarily flew towards the human-shaped bat’s mouth.</p><p>“Ah, help!”</p><p>“No, no…</p><p>Countless humans and G.o.dly beasts cried out in fear. Whether it was the true emperors, great emperors, or heavenly emperors, none of them had the power to fight back. They were all swallowed by the humanoid bat and became its food.</p><p>In one gulp, he had swallowed hundreds of thousands of living beings. Furthermore, there was an endless stream of living beings that were being devoured by him.</p><p>More than half of the hundred million living beings in the city had been devoured in the blink of an eye. hahaha, this small chiliocosm has so little pressure. It’s too fragile. I can destroy the world here!</p><p>The human-shaped bat laughed madly and continued to devour.</p><p>At the same time, in the southern part of the Tai Qing heavenly region, there was also a figure that was as tall as the sky, Walking in the Air.</p><p>This figure was also in the form of an adult, but his entire body was covered in a black robe. He held a large flag in his hand, and on the large flag, there were countless black shadows scurrying about.</p><p>These black shadows were All Souls, like evil ghosts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This figure also came to the sky above a giant city. Without looking at it, he waved the flag and it became infinitely huge, covering the entire giant city.</p><p>Not long after, the flag was lifted up, and all the living beings in the giant city died. Their souls were sucked into the flag.</p><p>Then, he continued to walk to the next big city.</p><p>Ma.s.sacre, endless ma.s.sacre.</p><p>Wherever these two living beings went, there would be endless slaughter. They treated humans and G.o.dly beasts as supplements and enjoyed them to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>In the lair of Zulong.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ancestral Dragon spread out their spiritual senses and immediately discovered this scene. “d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>&Nbsp; zu Long’s face was vicious and he roared in rage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely cold.</p><p>both of them are at first-level void G.o.d-level. Lu Ming, one for each of us!</p><p>Zu long said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took a step forward and headed north of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, on the other hand, charged towards the South of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>In the North of the Tai Qing heavenly region, the human-shaped bat had already devoured all the living</p><p>beings in the giant city.</p><p>The vast city, which was originally extremely prosperous, was now completely empty. Not even a dog or a chick could be seen.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat burped, and the greed and malevolence in his eyes became even more intense.</p><p>He set his eyes on the next giant city, and his huge body was about to rush there.</p><p>However, at this moment, the void front of them split open, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression was extremely cold, and his body exuded an extremely strong killing</p><p>intent.</p><p>These existences from the yuanluo Palace had really treated them as ‘medicinal ingredients, and could harvest and kill them at will.</p><p>“Eh? An ant at the transformation void martial stage?”</p><p>The humanoid bat was slightly stunned when it saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll let you die a horrible death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>“What? You want me to die miserably, ha ha ha, with just you, a transformation void martial stage martial</p><p>artist?”</p><p>The human-shaped bat began to laugh wildly.</p><p>He called the heavenly Emperor realm exactly the same as in the yellow Springs world.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the humanoid bat moved. It stretched out a large hand and grabbed at. Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming, a void transformation stage ant, was too arrogant. He wanted to swallow Lu Ming in</p><p>one bite.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. The divine weapon sword appeared in his hand and burst out with the way of the Dominator, slashing out.</p><p>The sword light burst out, and a sword mark that was millions of miles long appeared in the sky.</p><p>Pift!</p><p>The palm of the human-shaped bat was directly split in half.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat screamed miserably as it retracted its arm.</p><p>“How is that possible? You… You’ve mastered the Dao of a ruler! How could someone in a small chiliocosm</p><p>master the Dao of a ruler?”</p><p>The human-shaped bat cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was as cold as a knife. He held his combat sword and charged at his opponent.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
