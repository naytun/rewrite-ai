Although the opponent’s attacks were strange, Lu Ming could block them every time.</p><p>At times, Lu Ming did not even need to deliberately block. It was as if it was an instinct. When the other party attacked, he would instinctively attack and block the other party’s attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>After Lu Ming had adapted to the opponent’s attack, he began to counterattack. Every move was aimed at the opponent’s flaws.</p><p>Lu Ming could often discover the other party’s flaws in the nick of time and counterattack.</p><p>this battle awareness…</p><p>The more the serpent-man fought, the more shocked he became. At the same time, he was also excited.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged another hundred moves. At this time, the human-snake hybrid was completely at a disadvantage and was forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m done, I’m done!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the serpent-man raised his spear and a shocking force exploded. Lu Ming was immediately bounced away.</p><p>It was clearly the power of a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>After the human-snake hybrid flicked Lu Ming away, he did not pursue him.</p><p>Instead, he shouted and stopped fighting.</p><p>“I won?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>The Naga said. However, she was not unhappy at all. On the contrary, she was very excited. Her pair of eyes swept up and down Lu Ming’s body as if she was looking at a treasure.</p><p>Lu Ming felt goosebumps all over his skin.</p><p>“Cough, cough. Senior, Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Me? He’s the gatekeeper of this place!”</p><p>The Naga said.</p><p>“The gatekeeper?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The gatekeeper, you outsiders must take the test to enter the netherworld Island. We, the gatekeeper, will send you to different islands according to your performance!</p><p>let me tell you, there are many opportunities on many islands. It will be very beneficial for you outsiders!</p><p>The Naga said.</p><p>“Then how can we enter the yellow Springs Island?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>of course, it’s to pass all the stages. Just now, I tested your combat awareness. Your combat awareness is not bad, so you’ve passed this stage!</p><p>The Naga said.</p><p>“Senior, how do you know that the power I control is the Dao of a sovereign? have you seen it before? “Also, I see statues in the cursed Lands outside, and they all seem to contain the will of a sovereign. What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a series of questions.</p><p>you’ll naturally know these questions after you pass through all the checkpoints. Now, you’ll pass through this Island and go to the next island!</p><p>The Naga said.</p><p>let’s go to the next island. Didn’t they say that there are many islands with opportunities? does this Island not have any? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around.</p><p>stop looking. There’s nothing on this Island!</p><p>After saying that, the serpent-man’s figure moved and he disappeared.</p><p>“ ”Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Other people had the opportunity to pass the test, but he didn’t get anything.</p><p>Lu Ming moved forward dejectedly. He passed through the island and saw a floating bridge on the beach in front of him that extended to the next island.</p><p>From a distance, the island was a sea of red, as if it was filled with flames.</p><p>It was obvious that his path had already been arranged. He could only go to this Island because only this Island had a path. The other islands had no paths.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the pontoon bridge and increased his speed, moving forward at top speed.</p><p>When Lu Ming approached the island, he realized that the island was really covered in flames. It was like a Flaming Mountain.</p><p>The scorching aura could be felt even from far away.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming officially arrived at the island.</p><p>“What a high temperature!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the temperature of any part of the island was tens of thousands of degrees.</p><p>At this temperature, not to mention ordinary people, even many hard refining materials and some Special Metals would be turned into ashes.</p><p>Even Lu Ming had to channel his energy to resist it.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the island. The moment he did, the floating bridge in the yellow spring sea disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming started to patrol the area.</p><p>There was nothing!</p><p>This Island was completely silent. There was no vegetation or living beings on it.</p><p>this Island should be the second stage. What will be there? ”</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless and was on his guard.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt the ground shake. There seemed to be a giant walking toward him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sound grew louder and louder.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He saw a giant walking toward him.</p><p>One of them was a giant that was covered in flames. His body seemed to be made of lava. He was dozens of meters tall and looked like a small mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a short while, the giant raised his fist and smashed it down on Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of smashing, the giant’s fist wriggled and turned into a giant hammer.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked by the terrifying power.</p><p>“You can’t take it head-on!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea in his mind and he retreated quickly.</p><p>“In my hands, you can’t escape!”</p><p>I’ll go with you, ” the giant said. He took a step and leaped up at an astonishing speed. He approached Lu Ming with extreme speed and punched continuously with both fists. Balls of lava flew out of his body and turned into lava fists, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were too many lava fists, and each one of them was extremely fast.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge but he could not avoid all of them.</p><p>Lu Ming could only use the way of domination to condense a long spear and sweep it out, sweeping it towards the lava fists.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. His body flew out directly and crashed into a small hill. He spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Peak heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>The lava giant was a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>As for this place, it was the same as before. Lu Ming could not control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Without the ability to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, Lu Ming could only reach the level of a six-star heavenly Emperor by relying on his own strength. Even if he used his physical strength and the Dominator’s power, he would not be a match for the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The lava giant took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed. It launched another attack.</p><p>It pushed with both hands and a huge meteorite was formed. It was covered in lava and it fell towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and stabbed out a shocking spear radiance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s spear radiance shattered under the impact of the meteorites. The huge meteorites landed on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming was sent flying again and he vomited blood.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if his body was about to split apart. The terrifying lava wrapped around him, and he felt as if his body was about to turn into ashes.</p><p>If not for the fact that he was circulating the indestructible ancient scroll to block it with all his might, he probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand it.</p><p>However, the magma giant didn’t stop and threw another punch.</p><p>Lu Ming was already injured. How could he have the strength to resist? he was sent flying and his injuries worsened. All the bones and bones in his body had been broken into tiny pieces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
