Lu Ming shouted. His entire body emitted a dazzling purple-gold radiance as he tried to break free from the restraints and break through to the celestial Thearch realm.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming’s aura burst out, a seven-colored glow suddenly appeared in his surroundings within a radius of a million miles.</p><p>The multicolored light enveloped Lu Ming, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed down on him and bound him.</p><p>This was the power of the heavenly Dao. The heavenly Dao wanted to stop Lu Ming from breaking through! The Dao of domination was too terrifying. It should not have appeared in places like the heaven realm and the evil G.o.d Realm. That was because once one stepped into the heavenly Emperor realm with the Dao of domination, one would be able to dominate the heavens and earth, even the heavenly Dao.</p><p>This was something the heavenly Dao would not allow. It had to stop it!</p><p>The terrifying pressure continued to press down on Lu Ming. It even formed invisible chains that wrapped around Lu Ming,</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly and exerted all his strength to struggle.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The invisible chains on Lu Ming’s body were breaking apart continuously.</p><p>However, after it shattered, more chains appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles and bones vibrated rapidly at a frequency of more than fifty billion times per second. Such a violent vibration produced a terrifying power that shattered the invisible chains that wrapped around him.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming condensed a long spear in his hand with his ruler’s power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear vibrated and swept in all directions. Lu Ming wanted to break the restraints of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Rays of spear radiance shot up into the sky and spread in all directions. From a distance, one could only see countless spear radiance piercing holes in the sky and earth.</p><p>“He’s starting to break through!”</p><p>In the distant dark void, the ancestral Dragon sensed it right away and revealed a look of joy.</p><p>At the same time, the non-human divine ancestor also sensed it, and his face darkened.</p><p>it’s not that easy to break through in the heaven realm with the Dao of domination. The heavenly Dao doesn’t allow it!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>yes,” the ancestral Dragon replied. At the same time, he reached out his Dragon Claw and exchanged a blow with the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>On the Dragon sovereign peak, Lu Ming’s spear radiance was getting stronger and stronger. The power of every move he executed with the battle symbol art was amplified and strengthened. The power of cach move was extremely terrifying, and it kept blasting away the power of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>not enough, it’s still not enough. I must trigger the double combat strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>With his current strength, he simply couldn’t completely break free of the heavenly Dao’s restraints. In this case, be simply couldn’t break through.</p><p>Lu Ming kept unleashing the battle formula, hoping to trigger the double combat strength.</p><p>The probability of Lu Ming triggering the doubling</p><p>After about eight or nine times…</p><p>combat strength was about one-tenth.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt an endless fighting spirit burst out from his body. This fighting spirit was transformed into strength, causing Lu Ming’s strength to increase greatly.</p><p>The battle formula had been successfully activated. Double combat power, burst forth!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands swept out. The power of the heavenly Dao in all directions was constantly shattered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s long spear trembled. Endless spear radiance broke through the air and pierced through the void, breaking the power of the heavenly path one by one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body was getting stronger.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>In the dark void, the non-human divine ancestor’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually going to break the restrictions of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Zu long laughed wildly.</p><p>“Murderheart, quickly get rid of those two women and kill Lu Ming. Something’s not right!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor hurriedly sent a voice transmission to sacred ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>At this moment, the sacred ancestor bloodheart was still locked in a fierce battle with Xic nianqing and Xic nianjun.</p><p>A vicious glint appeared in sacred ancestor bloodheart’s eyes when he heard the non-human sacred ancestor’s voice transmission.</p><p>you two b*tches, how dare you block me? die, die!</p><p>dic! Saint ancestor bloodhcart roared. A terrifying aura suddenly burst out of his body, and endless blood light spread out and burned.</p><p>“Burn Shen power!”</p><p>Zu long was furious.</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart’s injuries hadn’t recovered to their peak because there wasn’t enough time. He might be able to in a few hundred or a thousand years.</p><p>Therefore, the strength of the sacred ancestor bloodheart had only barely reached the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>But now, sacred ancestor bloodheart was burning his divine power without any regard for the consequences. This way, his battle-power would rise to its peak in a short time.</p><p>Sacred ancestor bloodheart burned his divine power, and his battle-power skyrocketed. He slashed out two</p><p>times in a row with shocking power.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s expressions changed as they set up layers of defense front of them. However, their defenses couldn’t withstand the attack of Saint, ancestor bloodheart at all. They were crushed and sent flying tens thousands of miles away. Their delicate bodies trembled and blood flowed from their</p><p>mouths.</p><p>“Two stinky women, you still want to stop me? go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart recalled the demon. The blood-red light condensed into a sword and slashed at Xie nianging and Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xic nianging and Xic nianjun defended with all their might. They didn’t want to make any mistakes, but they wanted to avoid any.</p><p>However, after recovering to her peak, sacred ancestor bloodheart was indeed very powerful. She wasn’t weaker than the ancestral Dragon or the non-human sacred ancestor.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were only demiG.o.ds, so they couldn’t fight against sacred ancestor bloodheart at</p><p>her peak. After a few moves, they were sent flying.</p><p>The hearts of the people from the heaven realm sank.</p><p>If this continued, the situation would not be good.</p><p>he’s burning his divine power, so he won’t be able to hold on for long. As long as we can hold him off for a while, we’ll have a chance of winning. Xie nianging, do you still remember the dark holy light technique?”</p><p>Xie nianjun, send a message to Xic nianqing.</p><p>“I remember!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>alright, then we’ll use dark holy light technique to set up a dark holy light cage and stop him for a while!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded, and the two of them moved almost at the same time.</p><p>Instead of retreating, they advanced and charged at. Saint ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>The moment they charged out, their bodies emitted a brilliant radiance.</p><p>The difference was that Xie nianqing’s body was covered in endless darkness. Her body seemed to have turned into a black hole. It was so dark that her figure could not be seen at all.</p><p>As for Xie nianjun, he was surrounded by endless white light, more dazzling than the sun in the sky. Many</p><p>people couldn’t open their eyes.</p><p>“Dark holy light technique!”</p><p>Two crisp sounds were heard at the same time. Instantly, endless black and white light enveloped Saint</p><p>ancestor bloodheart</p><p>The speed of the light was unbelievably fast, and it immediately enveloped sacred ancestor bloodheart. Then, the black light and the white light intertwined like silk threads, forming a cage.</p><p>This was the dark holy light cage, a terrifying secret technique that could only be set up by Xie nianqing and</p><p>Xie nianjun together.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>dic! Saint ancestor bloodheart roared. The blood-red sword light cut across the void and slashed at the dark</p><p>holy light cage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard. However, the attack didn’t break the dark holy light cage. It only made</p><p>it shake violently.</p><p>D</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
