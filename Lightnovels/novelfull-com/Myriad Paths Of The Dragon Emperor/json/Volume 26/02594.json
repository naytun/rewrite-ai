After activating it, the few of them entered the battleship.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Starship glowed and shot up into the sky, breaking through the horizon.</p><p>However, just as the interplanetary warship charged into the atmosphere, a terrifying blade light slashed down from above and struck the interplanetary warship heavily.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Starship rumbled and shook violently.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest’s expressions changed.</p><p>Through the starry sky battleship, they could see a burly man with a horn on his forehead in the sky.</p><p>This was an expert of the rhinoceros people. The fluctuations emitted from this person’s body were as terrifying as a stormy sea. Ilis eyes were cold as he slashed out with his saber again.</p><p>Buzzwww.</p><p>The snow-white blade light. lit up the sky and struck the starry sky battleship. The starry sky battleship shook violently and rumbled continuously.</p><p>Fortunately, the defense of the interplanetary warship was strong enough. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be able to travel in the starry sky. It would be difficult for the other party to break through it in a short time.</p><p>However, the other party could not break it, but they could stop them. When the other experts arrived, they would be like turtles in a jar.</p><p>“Turn around!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er controlled the starry sky battleship and turned it around, flying back to the ground.</p><p>In the air, the rhinoceros man chased closely.</p><p>This burly man’s cultivation was shockingly high. Ile was definitely above the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm and was probably a terrifying expert at the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>It was obvious that this person had been patrolling in the sky carlier because he had expected Lu Ming and the rest to escape in the interplanetary warship.</p><p>If there were such experts in this area, there might be terrifying experts patrolling in other areas as well. They approached the ground but did not leave the interplanetary warship. Instead, they drove the warship</p><p>and flew.</p><p>The speed of the interstellar battleship was astonishing, far beyond that of the rhinoceros man. Very quickly, it left the rhinoceros man in the dust.</p><p>After shaking off the rhinoceros people, they left the interplanetary warship and flew on their own.</p><p>The movement of an interstellar battleship flying on the myriad Gold Star was too big and too eye-catching. If they kept flying, they would undoubtedly be courting death. Not only would they attract other experts, but they would also attract the powerful existences among the metallic desolate beasts.</p><p>However, their luck seemed to have run out. They had not flown for long before they encountered a group of people.</p><p>This group of people’s eyes lit up the moment they saw Lu Ming and the rest..</p><p>‘It’s them!”</p><p>“Kill them and take their treasures!”</p><p>This group of people charged directly at Lu Ming and the rest. The one at the forefront was a fifth-level void G.o.d-level existence.</p><p>There were also a few fourth level void G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>“Go, smash him to death!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. With a wave of his hand, the metal ball flew out and smashed towards the fifth-level void G.o.d-level existence.</p><p>With the metal ball’s current strength, it would have no problem blocking a fifth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouse.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, they rushed to the remaining people.</p><p>Being chased all the way, Lu Ming and the rest were filled with pent-up anger. It was a good time to go on a killing spree.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The metal ball collided with the fifth-level void G.o.d Realm expert. Xie nianjun’s sword turned into a sword-light that enveloped the two fourth-level void G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing charged toward the last fourth-level void G.o.d Realm cultivator.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the double combat strength and dealt with the others with Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could protect himself as long as he did not encounter any fourth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouses. Although the other party had more people, Lu Ming was fully on the defense. The other party could not do anything to him for a while.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing was completely overpowered by a fourth-level void G.o.d Realm existence. Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Xie nianqing had devoured the memories of his previous life. His combat experience and awareness were not much worse than Xie nianjun’s. His sword flashed and forced his opponent to retreat.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>After dozens of moves, the opponent was almost cut in half by Xic nianqing’s sword light. He was so scared that he retreated frantically.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianging’s sword suddenly changed direction and like a fairy from heaven, he attacked the people who were fighting Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A sword light flashed, and a few heads flew off.</p><p>A third-level void G.o.d Realm and two second-level void G.o.d Realm experts were killed instantly.</p><p>such swordsmanship, such combat skills…</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked as he watched.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s swordsmanship came from the same source. They were very similar and were simply wonderful.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he could not achieve it.</p><p>Especially after Xie nianging and Xie nianjun broke through to the martial G.o.d Realm, their strength had reached an even more shocking level.</p><p>This wasn’t a divine skill, but a pure use of the sword. It was a kind of technique and experience.</p><p>With their current divine power, it was still difficult for them to support the explosion of a divine skill.</p><p>Usually, one had to be at least at the peak of ethereal G.o.d Realm before they could practice the G.o.dly skill.</p><p>Buzzwww.</p><p>After killing three experts, Xie nianqing’s sword changed its momentum again and killed two more.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The rest of the people were shocked. They had so many people, but they were no match for Lu Ming and the other three young people. They were shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a violent air-piercing sound came from the distance, and a dozen streams of light shot over.</p><p>Another group of experts had arrived.</p><p>Those people from before were overjoyed.</p><p>it’s them! They have the treasure!</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill them!”</p><p>Those people from before shouted.</p><p>“It’s them, kill!”</p><p>The people who came later saw Lu Ming and the rest and charged over one after another.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and kept the metal ball. He then turned and left with Tong Xi ‘er, Xie nianqing, and Xie</p><p>nianjun.</p><p>Another group of enemies had arrived, and there were fifth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouses among them.</p><p>It would be unwise to stay and fight them head-on.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>Behind him, a group of people was in hot pursuit.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, covered tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>eh, something’s not right. Why is there not a single metallic desolate beast in this area!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>They had run for tens of thousands of kilometers, Logically speaking, they should have encountered many metallic desolate beasts, but just now, they had not encountered a single one. This was clearly abnormal.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a series of explosions came from the distance, and the earth shook violently.</p><p>Moreover, the vibration did not come from a single direction, but from all directions.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The people who were chasing after Lu Ming’s group had a change in expression.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>OWW!</p><p>Following that, the roars of beasts could be heard.</p><p>The quaking of the ground became more and more intense. Then, they saw countless metal desolate beasts</p><p>charging towards them from all directions like a tide.</p><p>“Beast tide, desolate beast tide”</p><p>Hurry up and run!”</p><p>“Fly to the sky!”</p><p>The people who were chasing Lu Ming and the rest panicked and exclaimed in shock.</p><p>However, there were wild beasts in all directions. With so many wild beasts rushing over, there would</p><p>definitely be nothing left of them. Many people rushed into the sky, trying to escape by air.</p><p>However, in the next moment, they were in despair!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
