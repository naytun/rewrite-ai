It would be easier for them to defend.</p><p>If they were to defend the nine levels of underground instead, their forces would be scattered and they would be defeated by the other party.</p><p>The heavenly realm Army gathered at the two battlefields and waited.</p><p>A group of people stood in the void outside the lair of Zulong.</p><p>Every single one of them was a terrifying expert. They were all unrivaled figures in the demigod realm.</p><p>In the past, they had always been in closed-door cultivation, but now they had all come out.</p><p>In front of them, there were two images. These two images could directly reflect the situation on the battlefield of the ruins of end and the battlefield of two world city.</p><p>This was where they commanded and monitored the situation of the two battlefields.</p><p>Dragon sovereign peak!</p><p>“The young master is still in seclusion. What should we do?”</p><p>Lei Yi asked the others.</p><p>the final battle is coming. We must participate in it. How about this? two of us will stay behind to protect the young master. The rest of us will go and participate in the battle!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>“That’s the only way!”</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>Not long after, a group of people flew out from the Dragon Emperor Peak. Those who were Emperor-to-be and above all flew to the two world city, leaving behind two heavenly Emperor-level figures.</p><p>For example, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, bubbles, Long Cheng, Huang Ling, and desolate li had all rushed to two world city.</p><p>In addition, the primordial realm’s large and small forces also transferred their powerhouses to the heaven realm to participate in the war through the void passageway.</p><p>This was a life-and-death battle. Even if some forces didn’t want to participate, they had no choice. If they didn’t want to participate, they would be eliminated by other experts.</p><p>In the sky above the Dragon sovereign peak, there was a flash and the figure of the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>He sized Lu Ming up for a while and said softly, ” “You’re about to break through. Lu Ming, I hope you can break through as soon as possible!”</p><p>After saying that, the ancestral Dragon disappeared and reappeared outside the lair of Zulong, at the command center.</p><p>Zu long, as the strongest person in the heaven realm, naturally had to sit here and command.</p><p>In the evil god World, there were also some figures standing in the void.</p><p>These were all non-human Kings and old non-human Kings. Of course, the one in the center was the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>In front of them, two pictures were floating in the air, showing two world city and returning bamboo city.</p><p>At this moment, countless evil god tribe’s Army was heading toward the heaven realm through the spatial passageway.</p><p>The void passage connecting the evil god World and the heaven realm was very wide and could accommodate many living beings at the same time.</p><p>send all the mutant beasts to attack returning bamboo city!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor gave the order.</p><p>As soon as he gave the order, someone immediately used a voice transmission jade talisman and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p>Of course, this place was too far away from the heaven realm. The Jade voice transmission talisman couldn’t transmit that far in one go.</p><p>However, they had messengers along the way.</p><p>This voice transmission jade talisman flew to the next Messenger, and this Messenger continued to send voice transmissions to the next one.</p><p>Just like that, it didn’t take long for the news to reach the heavenly realm.</p><p>There was a similar voice transmission route in the heavenly realm.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Army was split into two groups, and they charged toward returning flame city and two world city.</p><p>As time passed, the armies of both sides drew closer.</p><p>The battlefield outside the city of returning ruins suddenly roared like thunder. Countless strange beasts from the evil god Realm appeared and rushed toward the city of returning ruins.</p><p>This kind of mutant beast also had three eyes, a huge body, extremely bloodthirsty and crazy, and its battle strength was also extremely shocking.</p><p>“Get ready!”</p><p>A voice came from returning bamboo city.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>All kinds of roars were heard, and countless divine beasts of the heavenly realm were ready to go.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Countless strange beasts of the evil god World, either running on the ground or stepping in the void, made a loud rumbling sound and rushed toward the city of the ruins of end.</p><p>Boundless. It was truly boundless. He couldn’t even see how many beasts there were.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Above returning bamboo city, a Grand array glowed, and countless Grand arrays appeared.</p><p>The heaven realm had defended Guiji city for countless years. They had set up all kinds of formations like iron.</p><p>There were defensive types and also offensive types.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>When the evil god world’s exotic beasts were a certain distance away from returning flame city, someone gave the order.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A dazzling light shone on returning flame city. Countless attacks flew out toward the strange beasts of the evil god World.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The evil god world’s strange beasts were constantly killed, and blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>However, there were too many strange beasts from the evil god World. They were endless and surged toward the city of returning firmament like a tide.</p><p>To the evil god tribe, these exotic beasts were nothing more than beasts. They didn’t care about them at all.</p><p>The evil god world’s strange beasts were constantly being killed, but even more strange beasts were approaching returning flame city.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the evil god tribe’s strange beast reached the bottom of returning ruins city and slammed into the city’s defensive array. At that moment, the entire city of returning ruins trembled.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The divine beast Army on Guiji city kept attacking the strange beasts.</p><p>At the same time, the city of the ruins of end’s attack formation was also activated, and all kinds of attacks were launched at these strange beasts.</p><p>A large number of strange beasts were killed, but those strange beasts were crazy and fearless. They crazily hit the defensive formation of the city of returning ruins.</p><p>In fact, some of the beasts even chose to self-destruct.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The city of the ruins of end’s defensive array kept on rumbling, and the shaking became more and more intense. Some places finally couldn’t withstand it and were torn apart.</p><p>A large group of evil god world’s exotic beasts charged into returning flame city.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Army of divine beasts roared and attacked these strange beasts. The two sides met in close combat, and a tragic battle officially broke out.</p><p>At that moment, countless evil god tribe armies appeared on the battlefield outside the two world city.</p><p>There were no mutant beasts here. They were all experts from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Countless members of the evil god race were packed together, covering the sky and the sun as they charged towards the two world city.</p><p>Furthermore, there were all sorts of heavy siege weapons that crushed through the void as they sailed towards two world city.</p><p>“Get ready!”</p><p>On the two world city, the heavenly realm Army began to prepare. The formation glowed, and all kinds of defensive formations were activated.</p><p>The armies of both sides were getting closer and closer.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The heaven realm’s side was the first to attack, and all sorts of attacks flew toward the evil god tribe’s Army.</p><p>“Set up the formation and defend!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Army was completely different from the strange beasts of the evil god World.</p><p>They formed groups of too or 1000 people and formed defensive formations. At the same time, they used defensive weapons to resist. The attacks from the heaven realm did not have much effect.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Army continued to approach the two world city. The heaven realm’s Army had limited destructive power against the evil god tribe.</p><p>After all, it was a long-range attack, so its power was not particularly strong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the evil god tribe’s Army crashed into the two world city’s defensive formation and started to attack it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
