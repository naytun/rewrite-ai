The battle symbol art was the source of all battles. After comprehending the battle symbol art, regardless of the technique, divine power, or power, it would be enhanced.</p><p>Moreover, no matter what weapon he used, he had to be able to use it with his heart and could unleash its power to the greatest extent.</p><p>Therefore, there was no difference between Lu Ming using a sword and a spear.</p><p>“It seems like that trash from the three eyed race died in your hands…</p><p>The human-shaped bat roared angrily. It took out a divine weapon that looked like a pair of scissors and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a direct blow, and the human-shaped bat creature’s body trembled violently as it retreated.</p><p>“How is that possible? Your battle strength…</p><p>The human-shaped bat was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the transformation void martial stage. How could his combat strength be so strong? Could it be that existences who had mastered the Dao of rulers were this powerful?</p><p>The human-shaped bat found it hard to calm down. Even in the primeval universe, those who mastered the Dao of rulers were rare geniuses. He had only heard of them and had never seen them before. He had never imagined that they would be so terrifying that even he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming repelled the humanoid bat with one move and continued to attack the other party.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few more blows. The humanoid bat was no match for him at all, and was sent flying. His arm exploded, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had increased by a large margin compared to when he had fought, the divine ancestor of the non-human race.</p><p>Now, he had refined a divine weapon and his cultivation had broken through to the two-star heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>The human-shaped bat was only at the same level as the non-human divine ancestor. Furthermore, he had been injured by the heaven suppression seal when he had entered the heavenly realm.</p><p>Naturally, he was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>no, this person is too terrifying. I’ll find the others first and then kill this person!</p><p>The human-shaped bat turned small and flapped its wings in an attempt to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not let it escape. He moved and slashed his sword madly. Beams of terrifying sword light, enveloped the bat-like creature.</p><p>Pin!</p><p>The humanoid bat was slashed by Lu Ming’s sword and was almost cut in half. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and flew out. He was severely injured.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to kill me? you’re only from a small chiliocosm, and you dare to kill me? I’m from the yuanluo Palace. If you kill me, the yuanluo Palace will burn your bones and scatter your ashes!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat started to roar and threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved. This human-shaped bat had slaughtered hundreds of millions of living beings in the</p><p>heaven realm as soon as he entered. No matter what, he had to kill this person.</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the sword and turned into a terrifying sword light, slashing across.</p><p>PM!</p><p>This time, the human-shaped bat creature was really cut in half,</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The human-shaped bat roared in fear and tried to escape.</p><p>He had never thought that he would be in danger of dying the moment he entered.</p><p>Originally, he thought that it was just a small chiliocosm, and he could enter it to indulge himself. He never thought that he would end up like this.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and his combat sword slashed down once again.</p><p>This time, the humanoid bat could no longer avoid it. It was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword, and its soul was destroyed. It was completely dead.</p><p>This time, it was much easier for Lu Ming to kill a first-level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not dare to be careless.</p><p>The humanoid bat was obviously the weakest among the void G.o.d Realm experts. It was only at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Moreover, when the other party entered, he was injured. That was why he was casily killed by Lu Ming,</p><p>If the other party was not injured, it would not be so casy.</p><p>What would happen if he encountered a second or even third level void G.o.d Realm?</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the humanoid bat’s storage ring.</p><p>Before he could open it to check, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Ile realized that a powerful being was charging toward the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and furious. He did not know how many living beings had come in from the outside. The other party was obviously taking the opportunity to attack the heaven suppressing scal and wanted to</p><p>tear</p><p>apart completely.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed towards the heaven suppressing seal at top speed.</p><p>But he was still a step too slow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A burly man with a single horn on his head struck the heaven suppression seal, causing the crack to grow even bigger.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and slashed with his sword.</p><p>The one-horned man was shocked. He turned around and threw a punch at Lu Ming, which collided with the combat sword. The one-horned man’s body trembled violently and he was pushed back tens of thousands of</p><p>miles.</p><p>This horned man was also at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“The Dao of a sovereign!”</p><p>The one-horned man’s eyes were filled with deep shock.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss. Without a word of nonsense, he charged towards the one-horned man.</p><p>The one-horned man also burst out with all his strength and charged at. Lu Ming.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, a s.p.a.ce not far away cracked open and a pitch-black giant python appeared. It was as huge</p><p>as a mountain range and it charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He was another 1st level void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. His combat sword shook and split into two sword lights, slashing at the one-horned man and the giant python.</p><p>With two terrifying explosions, the void shattered. The horned man and the giant python were both sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was courageous and invincible. He continued to charge at his opponent. At the same time, he constantly activated the battle symbol art, wanting to trigger the double combat power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void shattered, and a burly figure appeared in the void. He was holding a saber and slashed over.</p><p>The saber Light was shocking and extremely terrifying,</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his sword, causing a terrifying explosion.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce within a radius of ten million miles was completely destroyed. The terrifying power landed on the ground, causing the earth to constantly explode, and a ten million Mile Long Gully was forcibly formed. Lava erupted from the depths of the ground, making it look like the end of the world.</p><p>It could destroy the heavens and earth!</p><p>It was truly destructive.</p><p>The entire taiging heavenly region was shaken.</p><p>At this moment, anyone in the heaven realm who had some cultivation could feel that a terrifying war had</p><p>broken out.</p><p>This was because the pressure of the G.o.ds filled the entire heaven realm, and everyone felt that a great disaster was imminent.</p><p>“Have the people outside come in?”</p><p>At the Dragon Emperor Peak, Xic nianqing stood in the air with deep worry in his eyes. He then stepped forward and headed in the direction of the heaven suppressing seal.</p><p>“Is it an expert from the primal universe?”</p><p>have the experts from the primeval universe arrived? Lu Ming, senior ancestral Dragon, are you fighting with</p><p>the outsiders?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone was discussing and guessing. A kind of fear was spreading in everyone’s heart. However, they were helpless and could only wait.</p><p>They couldn’t partic.i.p.ate in the battle between G.o.ds. They could only wait for the result.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Some of the demiG.o.ds all headed towards the heaven suppressing seal. After all, the battle was the most</p><p>intense there.</p><p>In the southern part of the Tai Qing heavenly region, they also felt the fluctuations, but they were not as</p><p>intense.</p><p>However, these demiG.o.ds didn’t dare to get too close. They could only watch from</p><p>distance.</p><p>23</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
