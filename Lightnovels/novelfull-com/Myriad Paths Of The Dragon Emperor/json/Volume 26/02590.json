Whoosh!</p><p>The metal ball rushed out and killed a fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level metal lizard. then attacked the other lizards.</p><p>“Leave two for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over as well. He held his combat sword in the air and blocked two third level virtual G.o.d-level lizards. They were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Over the past few days, he had been fighting with the metallic desolate beasts from time to time. His understanding of the battle symbol art had become deeper and deeper. The chances of him activating the battle symbol art had also increased.</p><p>They didn’t notice that a figure had appeared on a mountain peak far away from them.</p><p>This man was the bald man from the origin Luo Palace.</p><p>He had been searching for the past few days and came here by accident. He heard the fight here and came to take a look.</p><p>With a glance, his eyes revealed a cold killing intent.</p><p>“It’s that, it’s that treasure…”</p><p>His eyes were fixed on the metal ball.</p><p>Back then, he had rushed into the cave and seen the metal ball. Just as he was about to take the metal ball, the giant metal Eagle had returned, and he had run away in a hurry.</p><p>Now that he saw the metal ball here, he immediately knew who had tricked him back then.

Although the cultivation of Lu Ming and the rest did not seem to be high, there were fourth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouses among the people he had sent out. However, they had not returned in the end.</p><p>Therefore, he decided to use a sneak attack to get rid of a few people first.</p><p>He was extremely fast and soon, he was close to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s eyes suddenly turned in one direction. A holy light spread out and formed a sword. He slashed</p><p>out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wherever the sword light pa.s.sed, the metal trees were cut in half.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, divine power burst forth and a figure shot into the sky, exposed to everyone.</p><p>his spiritual sense is so sharp. Also, his divine power is so strong…</p><p>The bald man from the yuanluo Palace was shocked.</p><p>He had already concealed his aura, but he was still discovered by Xie nianjun. At the same time, he was shocked by the power of Xic nianjun’s sword.</p><p>The divine power of someone at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm was actually not weaker than that of someone at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>a monster! There’s actually such a monster in the righteous Army! We must get rid of him!</p><p>The bald burly man roared in his heart.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest recognized the bald man. They had seen him from afar</p><p>before.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and dodged the two lizards ‘attacks. Then, the metal ball rushed over and killed the two</p><p>lizards. It took out their beast cores and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er, you’re not dead yet. It seems that the people I sent are dead!</p><p>The bald man said ferociously.</p><p>“That’s right, we’ve already killed him!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said. However, her expression was a little grave. This bald burly man gave her a lot of pressure. He</p><p>was definitely a terrifying expert.</p><p>so, you were the ones who alerted the metal Eagle and lured it back to the cave?”</p><p>The bald man sneered, his eyes flashing with a fierce light.</p><p>“It seems that you’re not stupid!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Kid, give me that metal ball!”</p><p>The bald man looked at the metal ball on Lu Ming’s shoulder. The greed in his eyes intensified.</p><p>“You want it? Come and get it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The bald burly man moved and charged at. Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as the bald man moved, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun moved as well, A black and a white sword-light</p><p>flew towards the bald man.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A saber appeared in the bald man’s hand. The saber Light flashed as he slashed at Xie nianqing and the other</p><p>man, trying to shake off their sword light.</p><p>5th level void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell the bald man’s cultivation level the moment he made his move.</p><p>A fifth-level void G.o.d Realm was definitely powerful. Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun did not dare to fight the bald man head-on. They changed their sword stances and transformed into a dozen sword lights. They</p><p>dodged the bald man’s saber and stabbed at his vital points.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost!”</p><p>The bald man bellowed as he slashed his saber, However, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s combat techniques were too powerful. They dodged his attacks completely, but they were still able to attack his vital points at all</p><p>times.</p><p>The two of them joined forces, and the sword-light, kept flashing, forcing the bald man to be unable to rush</p><p>Over.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He took a step forward and charged at the bald man, slashing his sword at the man’s head.</p><p>“Gel lost!”</p><p>The bald burly man bellowed. His divine power boiled and burst out like a tide.

What a strong power!</p><p>Lu Ming felt his arms go numb and his blood and Qi were in turmoil.</p><p>Ka-bang!</p><p>At that moment, the metal ball threw a beast core into its mouth. As it chewed, its body rushed toward the</p><p>bald man.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, the metal ball changed sharply, turning into a big ball with a diameter of a few</p><p>meters, smashing towards the bald man.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The bald man’s blade hit the metal ball, causing a huge explosion. The metal ball was sent flying, but the bald man’s blade momentum also slowed down.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Xic nianqing and Xic nianjun’s sword radiance surged like two rainbow</p><p>lights and instantly attacked the bald man.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The bald man roared and slashed out with his saber.</p><p>A crescent-shaped blade light slashed out in all directions.</p><p>This was a large-scale attack. Even though it consumed a lot of divine power, it was very useful in this</p><p>situation.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>Although they could kill fourth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouses with their powerful combat techniques,</p><p>they were still no match for fifth-level void G.o.ds.</p><p>“Brat, die!’</p><p>After forcing Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun back, the bald man pounced at Lu Ming with a ferocious</p><p>expression.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the metal ball rushed out again, charging at the bald man.
