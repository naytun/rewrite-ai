BOOM!</p><p>The ground shook, and the Black Eagle King and the black wing King were pressed to the ground. They couldn’t move at all, as if they were being crushed by an extremely heavy mountain.</p><p>The scene fell into a dead silence.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. For a moment, they could not react at all.</p><p>After a long while, the crowd gasped.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Oh my God, what did they just see?</p><p>The Black Eagle King and the black wing King had been suppressed by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>They were a six-star heavenly Emperor and a five-star heavenly Emperor. They had dominated the heaven realm for countless years. They came and went without a trace. Some of the top experts couldn’t do anything to them because they couldn’t find them.</p><p>However, they were suppressed by Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>Was Lu Ming’s ability so powerful?</p><p>Terrifying, this was too terrifying!</p><p>Miracle. This was simply a miracle. No one had ever reached this stage at Lu Ming’s age.</p><p>After that, the entire place was in an uproar. Everyone was discussing excitedly.</p><p>As for the Black Bat King, he was almost scared to death when he saw this. His expression was even uglier than crying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked the Black Bat King’s stomach. The Black Bat King cried out in pain as his body was sent flying. He landed heavily on the ground, right next to the Black Eagle King and the black wing King.</p><p>“I’ll give you one last chance. Surrender and be my Guardian beast. Otherwise, you’ll be my dinner tonight!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His cold gaze swept across the three Lords of Darkness, causing them to shiver.</p><p>At the thought of becoming Lu Ming’s meal, they broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“We are willing to surrender, we are willing to surrender!”</p><p>“We surrender!”</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness shouted one after another.</p><p>At this moment, they knew very well that if they didn’t surrender, they would die.</p><p>relax your mind. I will plant a restriction on your souls. Whoever resists will die!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness nodded and bowed.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming planted a restriction in the three Lords of Darkness ‘souls. The three Lords of Darkness completely became Lu Ming’s Guardian beasts.</p><p>master, the three of us have offended many enemies over the years. If we surrender to you, I’m afraid many people will come to find trouble with you!</p><p>The Black Eagle King said worriedly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you’ve become my Guardian beasts, so you’re my people. No one will dare to find trouble with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, full of confidence.</p><p>“Yes, yes, master’s divine power is unparalleled. Whoever comes to find trouble with master will die!”</p><p>The Black Bat King immediately said with a fawning expression.</p><p>alright, you guys guard three directions of the Dragon Emperor Peak. Go!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness nodded and transformed into their original forms before flying in three different directions of the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>At this moment, many people were completely shocked.</p><p>The Three Kings of darkness, who had wreaked havoc in the heaven realm, had been subdued by Lu Ming with ease.</p><p>They were deeply shocked by Lu Ming’s means and combat strength.</p><p>Had Lu Ming’s abilities reached this level?</p><p>He could suppress a six-star heavenly Emperor with a flip of his hand. This kind of strength was already standing at the peak of this world!</p><p>“No, I must report this to the sect leader!”</p><p>“Hurry up and send a message to the patriarch!”</p><p>Many people started to take action.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming suppressing the three Lords of Darkness spread at a terrifying speed. It soon spread throughout the entire tai Qing heavenly region and even the primordial realm.</p><p>The heaven realm and the primordial realm were in turmoil because of Lu Ming’s matter.</p><p>Everyone who heard the news was dumbfounded.</p><p>What kind of strength was it to suppress a six-star heavenly Emperor with a flip of his hand?</p><p>Everyone understood that they had completely underestimated Lu Ming in the past.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming have many terrifying powerhouses behind him, but he himself was also an extremely powerful existence.</p><p>They finally knew why those peak experts had such a good relationship with Lu Ming. It was because Lu Ming was at the same level as them.</p><p>All the powerful forces and powerful existences no longer had any disloyal thoughts or thoughts about Lu Ming.</p><p>Many forces even sent emissaries to congratulate Lu Ming. Of course, they were blocked at the door by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have you already reached this stage? It seems that I’in not your match after all!”</p><p>On a mountain in the heaven realm, Tianming stood with his hands behind his back and a complicated expression on his face.</p><p>Now, he had also entered the great emperor realm. This cultivation speed could be said to be very strong in the history of the heaven realm. However, compared to Lu Ming, he was far inferior.</p><p>Heaven realm, Lin family!</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng, one of the nine absolutes of the heaven realm, was looking in the direction of the Dragon sovereign peak.</p><p>“As expected, I can’t be compared to Lu Ming. I should put down my pride and go to the Dragon Emperor Peak to seek Dao!”</p><p>With that, Lin Xiaofeng turned into a rainbow light and left for the Dragon Emperor Peak.</p><p>In the LAN family, everyone was silent after hearing the news. Then, they rejoiced.</p><p>Back then, they had a grudge against Lu Ming. However, they listened to the LAN family’s patriarch’s suggestion and sent gifts to Lu Ming as an apology in public.</p><p>In the past, many people were indignant and felt uncomfortable. They felt that there was no need to apologize to Lu Ming. However, they were all glad that they had resolved their grudges with Lu Ming. Otherwise, the LAN family would have been destroyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi, who had defeated Lin Xiaofeng to become the number one of the nine absolutes and was then defeated by Lu Ming, stood in the courtyard of the LAN family. He looked in the direction of Dragon sovereign peak with a complicated look in his eyes.</p><p>“Xuanyuan, you don’t have to worry about it. Lu Ming has shocked the world. Since ancient times, there has never been someone like him. He’s destined to be the protagonist of the world. We can’t compare to him!”</p><p>LAN Xia walked over and held Xuanyuan Yi’s hand.</p><p>He knew that Xuanyuan Yi had a knot in his heart ever since he was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>I understand. Xuanyuan Yi sighed after a long while, from now on, I won’t treat him as an opponent!</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>At this moment, countless people in the heaven realm and the primordial realm chanted this name.</p><p>Those who had a grudge against Lu Ming were all trembling in fear.</p><p>Those who were close to Lu Ming were all smiles.</p><p>From then on, Lu Ming had become a hegemon in everyone’s hearts, a giant of the heaven realm.</p><p>As for the people who went to the Dragon sovereign peak to cultivate, there were even more of them. They came in an endless stream.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reject anyone. In fact, he even personally held a lecture a few months later. Those who listened to him were deeply convinced by his teachings.</p><p>After that incident, the days at Dragon Emperor Peak became peaceful.</p><p>In fact, the entire heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil god Realm had been very peaceful during this period of time.</p><p>The two battlefields would occasionally have a battle. It was peaceful, and everyone was in seclusion, cultivating with all their might.</p><p>This was because everyone knew that this peace was only on the surface. No one knew when a shocking storm would erupt. At that time, everyone would be swept into it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
