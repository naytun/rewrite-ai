Nothing could be seen. At the same time, the world was completely silent. Not a single sound could be heard.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his attention and paid attention to his surroundings. He did not dare to be careless.</p><p>No one knew what kind of danger they would face next.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for a moment but realized that there was no movement at all. Other than the thick fog and the emptiness, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming decided to take action. He could not just wait here.</p><p>Based on his senses, Lu Ming identified the direction of the abyss and walked in the opposite direction.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was not fast. He maintained a constant speed as he advanced.</p><p>In front of him was a hilly area. Lu Ming had been walking for more than ten days. He had no idea how far he had covered.</p><p>During this period of time, there were no abnormalities, nothing attacked him, and he did not encounter any danger.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of water flowing came from the front.</p><p>Lu Ming was in high spirits.</p><p>For more than ten days, they had to move forward in a silent fog with a vision of less than two meters. This feeling was very uncomfortable. If it were an ordinary person, they would have gone crazy.</p><p>However, cultivators were determined. A dozen days was nothing, but it was not a good time either. Lu Ming was overjoyed to hear the voice.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward. A moment later, there was light in front of him. Lu Ming’s vision suddenly widened.</p><p>There was no fog in front of him. What he saw was an ocean, a boundless ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming was now on a beach.</p><p>“This seawater…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed when he saw the seawater.</p><p>This was because the sea water here was yellow. It was clearly the water of the yellow spring.</p><p>so much yellow spring water. Could it be that all the yellow spring water is flowing here? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised.</p><p>Standing on the beach and looking out, one could see the islands in the ocean.</p><p>Some of the islands were very close to Lu Ming and they looked like small black dots.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a small boat on the beach.</p><p>The small boat looked like it was made of wood, but it was completely fine as it floated on the yellow spring’s water.</p><p>this cursed land is called netherworld Island. Could it be a small island in this ocean, and I have to take this small boat to get to it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The next moment, a Thearch weapon appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he threw it out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was so great that the Emperor weapon flew out like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>However, when the Emperor-level weapon flew into the yellow spring sea, it seemed to encounter a strong resistance and slowed down. At the same time, there seemed to be a force of attraction in the yellow spring sea, and the Emperor-level weapon fell into the sea and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head with a bitter smile. Indeed, flying was not feasible. He could only take this small boat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not board the ship and set out to sea immediately. Instead, he searched around the area, hoping to find the others.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything. It was as if he was the only one left in the world.</p><p>I guess everyone’s experience is similar to mine. They should all see a small boat and take it out to sea. I believe we’ll meet again when we reach the yellow Springs Island!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then jumped onto the small boat without any hesitation.</p><p>With a burst of energy, the small boat sailed out like an arrow.</p><p>“Let’s go to the nearest Island first!”</p><p>Lu Ming headed to the nearest Island.</p><p>It didn’t seem to be very far from the island, but when they rushed over, they realized that it was really very far away.</p><p>The mam thing was that the water here was all netherworld water. He couldn’t speed up the boat, so it took more than an hour to sail a small distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not notice that not far away from him, a figure had suddenly emerged from the sea.</p><p>The upper body of this figure was that of a human, while the lower body was that of a snake.</p><p>This wasa Naga!</p><p>However, he could actually survive in the netherworld water. If Lu Ming and the rest saw this, they would definitely be shocked.</p><p>“Hehehe, has the myriad tribulation passed again? It’s been a long time since</p><p>I ve exercised my muscles and bones. I hope I won’t be disappointed!”</p><p>The Naga sneered before diving into the sea and disappearing.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to steer the boat forward.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt a sense of danger.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming turned around and threw a punch behind him.</p><p>A terrifying fist force pierced through the void and blasted out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure rushed out from the sea behind him. It was the serpent-man, and his entire body glowed. He condensed a long spear and thrust it at Lu Ming. It was hit by Lu Ming’s fist force and exploded with a bang. The powerful force carried Lu Ming and the small boat and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Serpent-men? It’s actually coming out from the yellow spring!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Kid, your reaction is not bad.”</p><p>The serpent-man sneered, his narrow eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“If you want to know, you have to defeat me first!”</p><p>The serpent-man said coldly.</p><p>“That’s good, then I’ll defeat you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. With a thought, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron appeared.</p><p>However, as soon as the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron appeared, it seemed to be suppressed by a powerful force and shrank rapidly. Then, it turned into a ray of light and flew into the space between his eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>hahaha, you still want to use treasures against me? let me tell you, in this place, you can’t use any treasures. You can only rely on your own strength. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The serpent-man laughed.</p><p>“I can still defeat you without any treasures!”</p><p>Lu Ming maneuvered the small boat and charged toward the human-snake hybrid. At the same time, a purple-gold radiance was emitted from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming used the way of domination and condensed a purple-gold spear. At the same time, he burst out with his physical strength.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength as soon as he attacked. He swept his spear and the purple-gold spear enlarged rapidly, sweeping toward the Naga.</p><p>‘This… This is the path of a hegemon! How is this possible?”</p><p>At this moment, the human-snake hybrid was completely stunned. He stared at Lu Ming with his eyes wide open. He had a very shocked expression on his face and had completely forgotten to defend himself.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear struck the serpent-man’s body. The serpent-man’s body exploded, turning into energy and disappearing.</p><p>“Eh? It’s not the main body, but a projection!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>At the same time, he was curious and surprised.</p><p>This was because the serpent-man had just mentioned the Dao of domination!</p><p>The serpent-men actually knew about the Dao of domination?</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled. Back then, the ancestral Dragon had also said that this was the power of a ruler. Now, this serpent-man had also said that this was the way of a ruler.</p><p>Most importantly, the name of this power was given by Lu Ming himself. This was because this power had a domineering aura.</p><p>It seemed that there were other people in the world who could control this power, and they were also called this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
