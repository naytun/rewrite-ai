He was completely crushed.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s divine power was strong, condensed, and indestructible. It was so powerful that it was unfathomable.</p><p>“I’m done, I’m done!”</p><p>After exchanging more than ten moves, Lu Ming retreated and decided not to fight anymore.</p><p>“You’re not fighting? Then I’m going to take back what you took from me!”</p><p>In a flash, Xie nianging appeared in front of Lu Ming and pressed his red lips against his.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to wrap his arm around Xie nianqing’s slender waist. He held Xie nianging in his</p><p>arms. His hands were already on the peaks of Xic nianqing’s chest, and he was rubbing them wantonly.</p><p>The two of them separated after a long while.</p><p>“You’re really lucky!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed.</p><p>“Hahaha, we’re already an old couple, yet you’re still shy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Then, they held hands and walked on the gra.s.sland.</p><p>“Little Qing, could it be that the Shen power you cultivate is divine grade Shen power?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>After being here for a few months, Lu Ming had looked for Tong Xi ‘cr and borrowed some books to read. They were all common knowledge about the primeval universe. Lu Ming had a lot of general knowledge about the primeval universe, including cultivation.</p><p>The divine power that the martial G.o.d Realm cultivated was also divided into different levels.</p><p>The Shen power that a normal person cultivated was just normal Shen power.</p><p>The Shen power that some geniuses cultivated was very powerful and more condensed than normal Shen power. It had many different mysteries. This kind of Shen power was called King grade Shen power.</p><p>Above King-grade divine power, there was a higher grade of divine power called sacred-grade divine power. Those who could control sacred grade divine power were all peerless geniuses who were one in a billion. Their combat power was shocking, and they could casily challenge those of higher levels.</p><p>Lu Ming suspected that the divine power that Xic nianqing cultivated was divine grade divine power. Of course, there was an even stronger divine power above the divine grade divine power. It was the divine grade divine power.</p><p>Divine-grade divine power was even rarer. Every kind of divine-grade divine power had endless wondrous uses. Every person who could control divine-grade divine power was a genius among geniuses, unparalleled. For example, when Lu Ming entered the martial G.o.d Realm, the path of domination would transform into the divine power of domination, which was a kind of divine-grade divine power.</p><p>my cultivation technique and my physique are quite special. Below the martial G.o.d Realm, it’s the process of building the foundation, Alter breaking through to the martial G.o.d Realm, I will undergo a transformation and become stronger rapidly. I have sacred grade divine power now, but it will become stronger in the future. When the time comes, I might even surpa.s.s your divine power of a ruler!</p><p>Xie nianqing explained with a smile.</p><p>“That’s great, I’ll be relying on you to protect me from now on!”</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked. After a while, they returned to their residence.</p><p>After returning to his room, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>“It’s almost time for me to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had already reached the peak of two-star heavenly Emperor. He could already break through to three-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the remaining divine crystals he had and started cultivating.</p><p>In his body, the power of the world and the power of domination were circulating rapidly. Lu Ming began to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The divine crystals exploded and turned into divine Qi, which was absorbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the divine Qi between heaven and earth surged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Dominator’s energy and world Energy in Lu Ming’s body continued to grow stronger.</p><p>However, the proportion of ruler’s power in it was slowly increasing.</p><p>Using divine crystals to break through was much faster than in the heaven realm. In just a few days, a powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. His cultivation had broken through and he had reached the three-star Celestial Emperor level!</p><p>Ilis strength had also increased.</p><p>with my current combat strength, if I activate the double combat strength of the battle formula, I should be able to fight against a third level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated about his combat strength.</p><p>When he was a two-star heavenly Emperor, his combat strength was still a little inferior to a second level void G.o.d Realm without activating the battle formula that doubled his combat strength.</p><p>Ile was slightly inferior!</p><p>This was because the gap between each stage of the void G.o.d Realm was even greater than that of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the three-star heavenly Emperor realm, he was confident that he could fight or even defeat a second level void G.o.d Realm powerhouse without triggering the battle formula that doubled his combat strength.</p><p>After using the double battle formula, he was confident that he could fight against a third level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Of course, the opponents he was referring to were those who could control ordinary divine power. It was naturally difficult for those who could control King-grade divine power and above to do so.</p><p>“But I don’t have many divine crystals left!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He originally had 5000 divine crystals. He had given 2000 to Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun, so he only had 3000 left. When he broke through to three-star heavenly Emperor, he had used more than 2000 divine crystals, so he only had a few hundred divine crystals left.</p><p>He instantly felt poor and under great pressure.</p><p>He had a family to feed now.</p><p>His son, granddaughter, parents, and disciples all needed resources for their cultivation.</p><p>Right now, their cultivation was not particularly high. The Supreme-grade raw stones and divine stones that he had left were enough.</p><p>Moreover, the cultivation environment. here was very good, so he didn’t need any divine crystals for the time</p><p>being.</p><p>However, as his cultivation level increased, he would definitely need divine crystals in the future. Lu Ming had to prepare some divine crystals.</p><p>Moreover, he needed a large number of divine crystals for his own cultivation. Otherwise, he would run out</p><p>of resources for his next breakthrough,</p><p>“How do I carn some G.o.d crystals?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think about this problem.</p><p>Previously, when Xie nianqing and the others broke through, the ancestor of technique had already taken out 10000 divine crystals. Naturally, he couldn’t be thick-skinned and ask for divine crystals from the ancestor of technique now. The ancestor of technique was already good enough to them.</p><p>let’s go out and take a look. Let’s see if the righteous Army has any missions that can carn divine crystals!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming walked out of the room and flew in the direction of the righteous divine Army.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived at the righteous Army when he heard someone calling him.</p><p>“Miss Xi ‘er!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you free to come to the righteous Army today?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said with a smile.</p><p>I’m here to see if the righteous Army has any missions that can earn me some divine crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“To carn G.o.d crystals? Why don’t we go to the myriad Gold Star? we can hunt the desolate beasts on the</p><p>myriad Gold Star and get their beast cores. We can sell them for quite a lot of divine crystals!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“Myriad Gold Star, how do I get there?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m also going to the myriad Gold Star to hunt dire beasts. Let’s go together, but we’re short on people. I</p><p>wanted to go to the righteous Army Mission Hall and find a few more people.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>“I’ll go find two people!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He thought of Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>sure, I’ll go rent an interstellar warship. We’ll meet here tomorrow!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er said.</p><p>22</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
