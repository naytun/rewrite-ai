Don’t let him run away. Chase him.”</p><p>The descendant of the ancient G.o.d roared and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chase him, we must catch this brat. This old man will burn his bones and scatter his ashes.”</p><p>The first elder of the ancient G.o.d roared and dashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and flew at full speed. He was extremely fast and soon, he was out of the valley.</p><p>Behind this Valley was a boundless region of hills and mountains. In some places, one could even see palaces and houses.</p><p>It was obvious that this was the residence of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, where the real ancient G.o.ds Mountain was.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could not care about that. He randomly chose a direction and rushed over. Behind him, the descendant of the ancient G.o.d was in hot pursuit.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to its limits. His speed was astonishing, and he leaped across the void like a kun Peng.</p><p>Not long after, a mountain peak appeared in front of Lu Ming. The environment on the mountain peak was very good. There was a small lake and a house was built beside the lake.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming saw a young lady by the lake cultivating her swordsmanship.</p><p>The sword technique was agile, like a silver snake dancing in the air. One could tell at a glance that it was extraordinary.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, the ancient G.o.d descendants in pursuit had a major change in expression.</p><p>“Not good, the third young lady’s residence is in front.”</p><p>A descendant of an ancient G.o.d exclaimed.</p><p>“Idiot, don’t shout …”</p><p>Another ancient G.o.d descendant shouted in anger.</p><p>What if Lu Ming heard her shouting so loudly?</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late. Lu Ming had already heard the person’s scream.</p><p>“Third miss? He seems to be a Big Shot.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he rushed toward the young woman.</p><p>The young woman had already seen Lu Ming. She was slightly stunned and then shouted, ” “Who are you? How dare you barge into my cultivation place?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on her. He condensed a large hand with divine power and grabbed the young woman.</p><p>“You, how dare you …”</p><p>The young woman was shocked. The combat sword in her hand slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This young lady had a cultivation base of peak ninth-level void G.o.d Realm and the divine power she controlled was very powerful. However, such a cultivation base could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>As the huge hand pressed down, the sword gleam collapsed and the young woman was caught in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“Third young miss …”</p><p>“Quickly release third miss!”</p><p>&Nbsp; behind them, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds rushed over, and when they saw that the young woman had been captured, their expressions changed and they began to roar.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>Lu Ming condensed a large hand with divine power, grabbed the young woman, and shouted coldly.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds all stopped in the distance, not daring to get close. It was obvious that the young woman’s ident.i.ty made them extremely afraid.</p><p>“You … Who was it? Quickly release me. ”</p><p>The young woman cried out and struggled with all her might. However, with her cultivation, how could she possibly break free?</p><p>“Third miss, this person is an outsider and has ill intentions.”</p><p>A descendant of an ancient G.o.d shouted.</p><p>“You … You’re an outsider? Let me go, you shameless outsider.”</p><p>The young woman struggled and cursed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved. He retreated rapidly with the young woman.</p><p>Shua shua shua!</p><p>Behind them, many figures flew over like lightning. The one in the lead was the first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan.</p><p>“First elder, save me …”</p><p>The young woman cried for help.</p><p>“Brat, let him go!”</p><p>The first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan bellowed. His terrifying aura pressed toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated. He almost spat out blood.</p><p>Terrifying. The great elder of the ancient G.o.d clan was extremely powerful. He was definitely at the divine realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to emit such a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“Back off, or I’ll kill her.”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted, exuding cold killing intent. The spear in his hand was aimed at the young woman’s forehead. The first elder and the other members of the ancient G.o.d clan were shocked.</p><p>“Brat, you dare?”</p><p>The first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan roared.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid? Anyway, you won’t let me go now. At most, we’ll die together. It’s worth it to have such a beauty to accompany me, hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The great elder of the ancient G.o.d clan looked terrible. However, the young woman’s ident.i.ty was not to be underestimated. She was the third daughter of the ancient G.o.d clan leader, and she was also a daughter that the ancient G.o.d clan leader loved dearly. He did not dare to act rashly.</p><p>He could ignore the life and death of his son, but he couldn’t ignore the life and death of the third daughter of the leader of the ancient G.o.d clan. Otherwise, he would be in serious trouble.</p><p>kid, let me tell you. Even if you catch the third lady, you can’t leave ancient G.o.ds Mountain. The ancient G.o.d clan will not compromise.</p><p>The head elder of the ancient G.o.d clan said coldly. His face was determined.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The great elder of the ancient G.o.d clan seemed to be determined not to let him leave the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. He didn’t even care about his son’s life, as if he was afraid that the secret of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain would be leaked.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to use the same tactic and use the young woman as a hostage to force the other party to let him go, the other party might want to fight to the death again.</p><p>If that was the case, he would definitely die in such an environment.</p><p>The only thing he could do now was to take a step back.</p><p>who said I’m leaving the ancient G.o.ds Mountain? I told you not to chase after me. Stop here. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He led the young woman and retreated slowly.</p><p>As expected, the great elder of the descendants of the ancient G.o.d did not pursue him. He watched as Lu Ming slowly walked away.</p><p>“First elder, are we not going to chase?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>let this kid leave first. This is ancient G.o.ds Mountain and he can’t get out. Let’s stabilize him first so that third lady doesn’t get hurt. Also, inform the patriarch of this place immediately so that he can send more powerful warriors to kill that kid.</p><p>The Grand Elder instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The other descendants of the ancient G.o.ds started to move.</p><p>Lu Ming flew with the young woman. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that no one was chasing after them.</p><p>Lu Ming specially flew towards a remote area. After flying for a while, Lu Ming found a Hidden Canyon and flew in.</p><p>“You outsider, let me go, or my father won’t let you off.”</p><p>The young woman called out.</p><p>is your father the clan leader of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not bad. Now that you’re afraid, let me go, you despicable and shameless outsider.”</p><p>The young woman glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>as expected, she is the daughter of the clan leader, a descendant of an ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. No wonder the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were so afraid.</p><p>He sighed at his good luck to have met the daughter of the clan leader of the descendants of ancient G.o.ds. Otherwise, he would not have been able to escape.</p><p>“Stay here. Otherwise, I’ll make you suffer.”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the young woman.</p><p>“Hmph, if you want to kill me, then kill me. You’re a vicious person, I’m not afraid of you.”</p><p>The young woman widened her eyes and glared at Lu Ming, as if she was not afraid of death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
