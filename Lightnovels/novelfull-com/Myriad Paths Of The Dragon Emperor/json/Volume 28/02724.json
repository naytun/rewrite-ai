In the end, he gritted his teeth and turned to walk into a room without a word.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, causing the long-faced young man’s body to stiffen and stop in his tracks.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>The long-faced young man asked with an unsightly expression.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him. He swept his gaze across the others.</p><p>“What about you guys? whoever wants to fight, come at me together. Let’s not waste time.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The other seven young men and women shivered and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>What a joke. The long-faced young man and an hai, two fourth stage true G.o.d Realm experts, were not Lu Ming’s match even when they joined forces. If they went up, would they be looking for a beating?</p><p>“Lu … You must be joking, senior brother Lu. With your strength, you’re more than enough to be the team leader. We’re sincerely convinced.”</p><p>“Not bad, not bad, we’re convinced.”</p><p>The others quickly nodded and bowed.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, the strong were respected. Since Lu Ming was stronger than them, they had to address him as senior brother even if he was only an outer sect disciple.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll say this first. Since I’m the captain, you have to listen to my orders. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Of course, of course, this is natural.”</p><p>The others nodded and bowed. Only the long-faced young man’s expression became even gloomier.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands. Everyone felt as if they had been granted Amnesty and they found a room to stay in one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming also found a room to stay in.</p><p>The next few days were very peaceful. Lu Ming was focused on cultivation. In the blink of an eye, seven days had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Seven days later, the ice Soul Clan members who had received them earlier arrived again. Lu Ming and the others came to the courtyard.</p><p>everyone, the geniuses from the other sects are all here. The ninth young lord intends to let everyone meet and familiarize themselves with each other so that they can better cooperate in the future missions. The ninth young lord has prepared a banquet. Everyone, follow me.</p><p>The old man from the ice Soul Clan smiled.</p><p>“Senior, how many sects are partic.i.p.ating this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Other than your Kong Xuan sect, there are five other sects. One of them is the Yimo Academy, one of the three overlords.”</p><p>The old man from the ice Soul Clan explained.</p><p>“Unique devil Academy.”</p><p>Lu Ming, an hai, and the rest were shocked.</p><p>What kind of mission was it this time? they had invited a total of six sects and even an Overlord force.</p><p>“Senior, What is the mission this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>The others were also curious. They couldn’t understand why the ice Soul Clan was so powerful that they had to ask for help when they couldn’t complete the task on their own.</p><p>Most importantly, they were just a group of young people. Any advanced-stage true G.o.d expert from the ice Soul Clan would be able to suppress them.</p><p>“The ninth young master will explain this to you later.”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan elder smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>The group followed the old man, and not long after, they arrived at an empty courtyard.</p><p>The courtyard was huge, and there was a small lake in the middle of the courtyard. The strangest thing was that the water in the lake did not freeze at such a low temperature.</p><p>There were already rows of seats by the lake.</p><p>The seating arrangement was also very particular. It was divided into seven areas.</p><p>The topmost area had the most seats, and it was already filled with people.</p><p>These people all had long, white hair and white eyes. One could tell at a glance that they were from the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The other five seats were also filled. Clearly, these people were from the other five sects.</p><p>Everyone landed on the ground. The old man walked to the ice Soul clan’s seats and bowed to a young man in the middle.”Ninth young master, the people from the Kong Xuan sect have arrived.”</p><p>The young man had long white hair and was very handsome. He was the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing.</p><p>“Alright, you may leave!”</p><p>Bing Qing waved her hand.</p><p>The old man from the ice Soul Clan and the others bowed and left.</p><p>Lu Ming, an hai, and the rest sized up the people from the other sects.</p><p>They were all young people.</p><p>The people from the other five sects and the ice Soul Clan were all young people. Judging from their life auras, they were all less than 10000 years old.</p><p>“Eh? Hu ya!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he looked at an area.</p><p>This area was the area where the unique demon Academy was located. The unique demon Academy had the most people, a total of 18 people. Lu Ming recognized one of them. He was Hu ya, the genius of the Tiger clan who had fought with Lu Ming during the Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘disciple recruitment test.</p><p>While Lu Ming and the rest were sizing up the others, the others were also sizing them up.</p><p>hehe, the Kong Xuan sect actually sent a void G.o.d Realm cultivator for this mission. What a joke. Are they looking down on the ice Soul Clan and treating the mission as a joke? ”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp voice rang out. It came from the unique demon Academy, and it was a youth from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The others also looked curious.</p><p>Lu Ming did not deliberately hide his strength. The others could tell at a glance that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at eighth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The people who came to complete the mission this time were all geniuses above the true G.o.d Realm. Even the ice Soul Clan was surprised that the Kong Xuan sect had sent a void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>don’t talk nonsense. When has the Kong Xuan sect ever looked down on the ice Soul Clan? ”</p><p>An hai looked at the young man from the unique devil Academy and said in a displeased manner.</p><p>“You still say you don’t have it? Then why did they send a virtual G.o.d-level person? I think your Kong Xuan sect is clearly trying to do this half-heartedly while still trying to earn a lot of benefits.”</p><p>The young man from the unique devil Academy sneered.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was the leader of the top ten sects. Their strength had increased rapidly in recent years, and they were already threatening the position of the three Overlord forces. Therefore, the three Overlord forces did not have a good relationship with the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Now that the Yimo Academy had seized the opportunity, they naturally wanted to suppress the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“You’re farting. Your unique demon Academy is the one who is perfunctory.”</p><p>An hai shouted.</p><p>“What did you just say? Are you looking for abuse?”</p><p>The young man from the unique demon Academy was not afraid at all, and a powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you.”</p><p>An hai shouted, not backing down at all. The smell of gunpowder filled the air, and a great battle was about to break out.</p><p>haha, you are all guests from afar. Why don’t you all sit down and have a drink first? ”</p><p>At this moment, the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing, laughed and tried to smooth things over.</p><p>He still had to give face to the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan. The young man from the unique demon Academy concealed his aura and looked at an hai coldly.”For the sake of young master bingqing, I’ll spare you this time.”</p><p>“Hmph, it’s still not certain who’s going to let who off.”</p><p>An hai said unhappily.</p><p>“Haha, everyone from the Kong Xuan sect, please take a seat.”</p><p>Bing Qing laughed again, then pointed to an empty seat.</p><p>There were a total of ten tables and chairs in this area, which was the same number as the ten people from the Kong Xuan sect. It was obvious that they had prepared this for the Kong Xuan sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
