Lu Ming, you’ll be the ‘bait’!” He said.</p><p>Yue Linglong said with confidence.</p><p>Before she and Wu Zifeng made the breakthrough, their fighting power was already very shocking. Now that they had broken through to the first stage of true G.o.d, their fighting power had increased by a large margin. Naturally, they were full of confidence.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. How did he become the ‘bait’?</p><p>There was no time to lose. There was still less than half a month to the three-month deadline. The three of them left this place and rushed towards the canyon.</p><p>However, when they arrived at the canyon, they did not see a single netherdragon.</p><p>it’s the same move again! There are many nether Dragon beasts lying in ambush!</p><p>Yue Linglong spread out her spiritual sense and discovered many nether Dragon beasts.</p><p>Now that her cultivation had broken through, her spiritual sense had become sharper and could cover a wider range, which was why she was able to discover those nether Dragons.</p><p>Clearly, the nether Dragon beast wanted to use the same tactic again. Once they entered the canyon, it would surround them with the Dragonbone flower.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest were bold and fearless now. They might as well beat him at his own game.</p><p>The three of them acted as if they had not seen the netherdragon beast. They entered the canyon and pa.s.sed through it, returning to the gra.s.sland.</p><p>During the battle, the gra.s.sland was in a state of chaos. However, in just a month, the gra.s.s had grown back.</p><p>Rustle … Rustle …</p><p>In the distance, rustling sounds could be heard.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In the distance, waves rippled in the sea of green gra.s.s, and then hundreds of Dragon Bone flowers appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Some of the Dragon Bone flowers sprung and charged toward Lu Ming and the other two like bolts of lightning, launching fierce attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yue Linglong had just made a breakthrough in her cultivation and was eager to try. She immediately rushed over.</p><p>This time, she didn’t use a soft whip. Instead, she took out a combat sword, which was a middle-grade divine weapon.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light burst out like a flying immortal. Then, the two stalks of the Dragon Bone flowers were directly cut off by Yue Linglong. They died on the spot without any signs of life.</p><p>As for the Dragon Bone, Yue Linglong waved her hand and put it away.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng moved as well, rushing toward the Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Lu Ming activated the ‘battle formula’ with all his might. He first activated the double combat power.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and sent a Dragon Bone flower flying. Then, he swung his sword again and cut off the stem of another Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>As soon as the three of them attacked, they killed more than ten Dragon Bone flowers in a row, which seemed to have angered the remaining Dragon Bone flowers.</p><p>The rest of the Dragon Bone flowers let out ear-piercing shrieks and charged toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had successfully triggered the tripled combat power.</p><p>the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-breaking!</p><p>Lu Ming used his combat sword to cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes. A sword light that was hundreds of miles long flashed past.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>More than thirty Dragon Bone flowers had their stems cut off by Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s combat strength was tripled and he had reached the second stage of the three apocalyptic strikes. This move was almost Lu Ming’s strongest move and its power was shocking.</p><p>In one move, he had killed more than 30 Dragon Bone flowers.</p><p>However, the amount of divine power it consumed was also astonishing.</p><p>“With my divine power, I can only use a few moves to release the three apocalyptic strikes at full power!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed bitterly to himself. His weakness was that his cultivation level was not high enough and his divine power was not strong enough. Although he had cultivated other King-grade divine power and his divine power was far stronger than cultivators of the same level, he was only at fifth level void G.o.d Realm after all.</p><p>Although the three apocalyptic strikes were powerful, he could not fully display them.</p><p>Similarly, he couldn’t fully use the nine stage Crimson Gold armor.</p><p>The stem of the Dragon Bone flower was cut off and the Dragon bones fell to the ground. Lu Ming swept them up with his divine power and kept them.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong were also shocked by Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>Wu Zifeng was considered to be knowledgeable and had seen many terrifying geniuses. However, it was his first time seeing someone as powerful as Lu Ming.</p><p>They gathered their thoughts and focused on hunting the Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>With the strength of the three of them, it was much easier to hunt for the Dragon Bone flower now. It was completely a crushing defeat. It was a world of difference from the pa.s.sive state they were in a month ago.</p><p>Soon, they had killed more than 150 Dragon Bone flowers.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the distance.</p><p>The netherdragon had appeared.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce trembled as the netherdragon beast charged toward them.</p><p>“Keep it up!”</p><p>The three of them put in even more effort to hunt down the Dragon Bone flowers. They used all of their techniques to kill as many Dragon Bone flowers as possible before the nether Dragon beast arrived.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes again, air blast.</p><p>With one move, another thirty Dragon Bone flowers were killed.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also used their unique skills. Their combat strength was amazing, and a large number of Dragon Bone flowers died at their hands.</p><p>Originally, there were nearly three hundred Dragonbone flowers, but before the nether Dragon beast arrived, there were less than a hundred left.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A large group of nether Dragon beasts, at least three hundred in number, charged toward Lu Ming and the rest. There were even more behind.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two charged toward the nether Dragon beast and engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>One nether Dragon beast after another died at their hands.</p><p>Although the netherdragon beast and Dragonbone flower were powerful, they had their weaknesses. Now that their strength had increased, it would not be too difficult for them to kill them.</p><p>This battle went on for half an hour. Hundreds of nether Dragon beasts and hundreds of Dragon Bone flowers were killed by the three of them. Only a few dozen nether Dragon beasts were still attacking them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, catch!”</p><p>At that moment, Yue Linglong waved her hand and a divine pill flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Spirit strengthening pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that it was a spirit strengthening pill at a glance. However, the medicinal fragrance was strong and the medicinal effects were many times better than those that Lu Ming had obtained in the past. This was a Supreme-grade spirit strengthening pill.</p><p>The market price was shockingly high.</p><p>Refining a transformation spirit strengthening pill could recover one’s divine power extremely quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming swallowed the spirit strengthening pill in one gulp. The pill immediately turned into medicinal power and circulated through Lu Ming’s body. He quickly absorbed it. Lu Ming’s divine power, which was about to dry up, was quickly restored.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng had both taken Supreme-grade spirit-strengthening pills to recover their divine power.</p><p>There were only dozens of nether Dragon beasts and a small number of Dragon Bone flowers left. They did not need to use their unique skills. They fought slowly while recovering their divine power.</p><p>The Supreme-grade spirit strengthening pill had extraordinary effects. Not long after, the four divine flames in Lu Ming’s dantian burned fiercely again. His divine power had recovered by 80%.</p><p>Their divine power had recovered by a large amount. They became more alert and their attacks became fiercer. The remaining nether Dragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers were quickly killed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
