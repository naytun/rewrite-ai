He dashed toward Lu Ming and formed a huge palm with one hand, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His divine energy was boiling as he cast the moon-cutting sword of the three apocalyptic strikes. A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed at the palm print.</p><p>At the same time, nine ice chains flew out of Lu Ming’s body and rushed towards the palm print.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded, the mountains shook, and the earth trembled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was once again thrown back a hundred miles. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. However, he managed to block the opponent’s palm print.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s divine body was extremely strong. Wisps of blood Qi flowed out of his ancient G.o.d’s heart, and Lu Ming’s injuries were completely healed in an instant.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>The surrounding spectators all revealed expressions of shock.</p><p>No matter what the outcome was today, Lu Ming’s combat strength was shocking. He could actually block Liu Feiyun’s attacks continuously.</p><p>Liu Fei Yun’s face darkened.</p><p>Although he did not use his full strength, he was a celestial G.o.d-level powerhouse after all. He felt embarra.s.sed that he could not suppress Lu Ming even after a series of attacks.</p><p>He was about to continue attacking but Lu Ming had already made the first move.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he appeared above Liu Feiyun’s head. The long spear struck down with force. It was the same move as the moon-cutting technique.</p><p>At the same time, nine ice chains flew down and wrapped around Liu Feiyun.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun said coldly and struck out another palm.</p><p>Although he had only used one palm, more than ninety percent of his divine power had been unleashed. He wanted to completely suppress Lu Ming with this palm.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had a thought and QiuQiu flew out directly. It turned into a huge metal ball and blasted toward Liu Feiyun.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack and QiuQiu’s attack hit Liu Feiyun’s palm print simultaneously.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An even more terrifying vibration erupted. Liu Feiyun’s palm print shook violently, and cracks appeared on it.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>Liu Fei Yun’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming could actually break his attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Liu Feiyun’s palm print crumbled and Lu Ming’s long spear swept out.</p><p>Liu Feiyun retreated quickly, but it was too late. Blood splattered everywhere. Liu Yunfei’s body was cut by the spear radiance. The wound was so deep that his bone could be seen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Liu Feiyun exploded with all his might. His divine power swept out like a wave, blocking Lu Ming and QiuQiu’s subsequent attacks.</p><p>Liu Feiyun is actually injured!</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all stunned.</p><p>He was furious!</p><p>Liu Feiyun himself was furious.</p><p>His entire body was filled with a terrifying killing intent. His eyes were extremely ferocious as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>He, a dignified celestial G.o.d-level powerhouse, was actually injured by Lu Ming, a third-stage true G.o.d. This was simply an insult to him.</p><p>He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>“Good, very good. Lu Ming, I’ll make you beg for death today!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun said ferociously. His aura became even more terrifying. A pair of divine gloves appeared on his hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Liu Feiyun turned into a bolt of lightning and charged at Lu Ming. He struck out with both hands and several huge palm prints came at Lu Ming. They were much stronger than before.</p><p>This was Liu Feiyun’s true combat power. He was absolutely powerful.</p><p>One must know that the divine power he controlled was King grade divine power. It was even stronger than those first level heavenly G.o.ds who controlled ordinary divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor and controlled the nine ice chains. Then, he cast the three apocalyptic strikes and charged toward Liu Feiyun.</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu spun rapidly and attacked Liu Feiyun together with Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not ask QiuQiu to cast that kind of lightning. It was not the time yet. That kind of lightning would only be effective at the critical moment.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides collided once again, and a terrifying boom erupted.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his long hair flying in the wind. He exerted all his strength to the extreme.</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu also exploded to its limit. But even so, Lu Ming and QiuQiu were still at a disadvantage despite joining forces. The two of them were suppressed and kept retreating.</p><p>The divine power of a celestial G.o.d was extremely strong. Every move was filled with explosive power, and Lu Ming was almost suffocating from the pressure.</p><p>If QiuQiu had not withstood most of the pressure, Lu Ming would have been defeated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides had exchanged dozens of rounds.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Cracks appeared on Lu Ming’s nine-layer Crimson Gold armor. It could not hold on any longer.</p><p>The ice chains also made cracking sounds.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Divine power gushed out from the ” measure ” formula. Lu Ming remained at his peak. The Scarlet Gold armor on his body glowed brightly again and the nine ice chains became solid.</p><p>“What’s wrong with this kid?”</p><p>Liu Fei Yun was shocked.</p><p>Logically speaking, Lu Ming was only at the third tier true G.o.d Realm. In such a high-intensity battle, his divine power should have been exhausted long ago. However, since the start of the battle, Lu Ming had been maintaining several divine skills at the same time and was still as lively as a Dragon and a Tiger. He was simply a monster.</p><p>“Burning Blood Grand magic!”</p><p>Seeing that the battle was going on for a long time, Liu Feiyun became anxious and used his secret skill. His body was covered in a layer of fiery red blood light, as if his blood was burning.</p><p>At the same time, his combat strength had also increased by several times.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and QiuQiu were sent flying at the same time and they retreated rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming, in particular, spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun roared and charged at Lu Ming. His palm turned into a claw and clawed at Lu Ming, as if he was going to break all the bones in Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>There was a crazed look in Lu Ming’s eyes. He circulated several divine skills and secret skills with all his might and was highly focused.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The Scarlet Gold armor on Lu Ming’s body suddenly became more solid and the light became more dazzling.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He had broken through the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor and reached the fifth layer. His defense had increased greatly.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Liu Feiyun was shocked beyond words. He had naturally noticed Lu Ming’s breakthrough.</p><p>“So what if I’ve broken through? You want to block my attack? dream on!”</p><p>Liu Yunfei increased his speed and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine ice chains and wrapped them around Liu Feiyun.</p><p>The ice chain was extremely powerful against true immortal realm experts, but it was not enough to deal with Liu Fei Yun, who was a heavenly G.o.d.</p><p>Under Liu Feiyun’s attacks, the ice chains kept breaking.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed as he swung his long spear down. A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed toward Liu Feiyun.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun was not afraid at all. He clawed at the spear ray, bringing with him a terrifying wave of energy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
