He had to suppress Lu Ming first before dealing with QiuQiu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Liu Feiyun’s claw grabbed onto Lu Ming’s spear radiance and shattered it. A terrifying force was directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu also smashed into Liu Yunfei’s body, but it was blocked by his defensive divine skill.</p><p>now is the time. Ball ball, lightning …</p><p>Lu Ming shouted with his mental strength.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>QiuQiu’s entire body emitted a series of electric lights, which converged into a lightning bolt as thick as an arm, and blasted toward Liu Feiyun.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bolt of lightning pierced through Liu Feiyun’s defense and struck his body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Liu Yunfei shrieked in pain as his body trembled violently. He retracted half of the force that he was about to use to attack Lu Ming. His claws grabbed onto Lu Ming’s Scarlet Gold armor and sent him flying.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming was still severely injured and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>However, Liu Feiyun was worse off than him.</p><p>He didn’t have much defense against QiuQiu. After the previous battle, he already had a clear understanding of QiuQiu’s strength. He never thought that QiuQiu would have such a terrifying lightning.</p><p>Therefore, QiuQiu’s bolt of lightning struck him directly, causing his body to hurt as if it was being torn apart. His body was also numb, and for a moment, it was difficult for him to move.</p><p>“QiuQiu, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>A heavenly G.o.d’s strength was too shocking. Even if he was. .h.i.t directly, Liu Yunfei would not be seriously injured. Now was the best time to completely suppress Liu Feiyun.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Bright lightning appeared on QiuQiu’s body again.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The young men with Liu Yunfei roared and pounced on QiuQiu, trying to stop it.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not care less about his injuries. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged at the few people, sweeping his long spear horizontally.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Those few young men were only at true G.o.d-level and could not withstand Lu Ming’s current strength. They were swept away by the Spear’s gleam and fell to the ground, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>One move and he was seriously injured.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu’s second bolt of lightning had already shot out and struck Liu Feiyun’s head.</p><p>Liu Feiyun screamed in pain. His body turned black and smoke rose from his body. His body was split open. The moment blood flowed out, he was burned by the lightning and turned into smoke.</p><p>“Bind!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and rushed over. The nine ice chains appeared again and wrapped around Liu Feiyun. The terrifying chill instantly froze Liu Feiyun.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ice chain lifted Liu Yunfei up and threw him heavily. Liu Yunfei fell to the ground and created a big pit. Cracking sounds came from Liu Yunfei’s body. Many of his bones were broken.</p><p>Liu Feiyun was severely injured and had no strength to fight back.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all dumbfounded. They didn’t expect such an outcome.</p><p>If Lu Ming, who was at true G.o.d-level, went to Liu Yunfei’s house to fight him, the final result would be Liu Yunfei being defeated and severely injured.</p><p>I told you to kneel down and apologize to my subordinates. Now, kneel down to me first!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He controlled the ice chain and Liu Feiyun, wanting him to kneel down.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare? Ah!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun howled and struggled madly. However, he was already severely injured. All his bones were broken and he was bound by the ice chains. He could not break free at all.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>He was forced to kneel in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Liu Yunfei shouted hysterically. His eyes were red and his killing intent was extremely cold.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? You should have thought of this when you injured my men. Now, go and kowtow to my men and admit your mistake!”</p><p>Lu Ming was about to bring Liu Yunfei back to an Hai’s residence so that he could kowtow and apologize to an hai and the rest.</p><p>The others sighed. Lu Ming was really strong and overbearing.</p><p>“How dare you! Let him go!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the distance. At the same time, an extremely terrifying aura blotted out the sky and filled the air.</p><p>“The Tian Hong Saint son!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the Tian Hong Saint son had arrived the moment he heard the voice.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and landed beside Liu Feiyun. The next moment, a young man appeared in the sky and looked down at Lu Ming.</p><p>Who else could it be but the Tian Hong Saint son?</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes fell on Liu Feiyun. Cold killing intent burst out of his eyes when he saw Liu Feiyun’s miserable state.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you know that Liu Feiyun is one of my men?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s voice was cold.</p><p>“So what if I know? So What if I don’t know?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I’ll make you pay ten times the price for hitting my people!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>“I’m afraid he’ll be crippled before I pay the price!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Liu Feiyun.</p><p>“You think you can use him to threaten me? You’re so naive!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered. He had just finished speaking when he disappeared.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He focused his mind, trying to capture the Tian Hong Saint son’s figure.</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming’s body, making him feel as if he had fallen into a swamp.</p><p>“Break …”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and burst out with all his strength. He exerted his strength to the extreme. A Spear’s gleam soared into the sky and broke through the surrounding pressure.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming’s body regained some freedom, his nine ice chains shook violently and suddenly shattered into pieces. Liu Feiyun was swept away by a force.</p><p>Then, not far in front of Lu Ming, the Tian Hong Saint son appeared with Liu Feiyun in his hand.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s strength was beyond his expectations. He had not even been able to react when the Tian Hong Saint son had suddenly attacked and saved Liu Feiyun from his hands.</p><p>Unfathomable!</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that the Tian Hong Saint son’s cultivation was at least at the third level of the celestial deity realm. Moreover, the divine energy he controlled was definitely of the divine grade. Liu Yunfei could not compare to him.</p><p>“You want to fight me with your puny strength? I’ll cripple you today.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was very powerful. Golden divine power danced around his body, forming a terrifying wave that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated continuously. He could not withstand the pressure and took more than ten steps back.</p><p>It was the same for QiuQiu. It was pushed back by the pressure and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder. Its eyes were filled with solemnity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
