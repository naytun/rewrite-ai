He was also the number one true G.o.d stage expert in Kong Xuan sect and was ranked sixth on the true G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son was actually going to send out long Xian.</p><p>The eyes of the Tianhong Saint son, the sacred son of reflection, and the others lit up.</p><p>“Yes, Saint!”</p><p>Behind the Supreme Holy Son, a thin young man in a black robe nodded. His figure flashed and he appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Long Xian is about to make his move, there’s going to be a good show.”</p><p>Many people revealed looks of antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>They all wanted to know if the Dragon barrier could stop Lu Ming’s winning streak.</p><p>There was no doubt about long Xian’s power. He was ranked sixth on real G.o.d ranking list and he was definitely far above Xue Yu. Xue Yu was merely ranked eighty-seventh on real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>“I’ll give you some time to rest and recover!”</p><p>Long Xian looked at Lu Ming and spoke indifferently. Even though Lu Ming had displayed shocking strength, he still had great confidence in himself.</p><p>“No, let’s fight now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It seems that you are very confident. In that case, don’t say that I took advantage of you. Be careful!”</p><p>Long Xian reminded him as a pitch-black spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Long Xian’s weapon was also a spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Long Xian stomped on the ground heavily. His body was like a stream of light as he charged toward Lu Ming. A black spear ray shot out like a shooting star toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming also thrust his spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two spearlights collided in the void, creating a shocking boom and setting off a violent airflow that scattered in all directions.</p><p>At the same time, the two figures floated back. The collision this time was a tie.</p><p>“Sacred grade divine power.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The divine power that long Xian controlled was divine grade divine power.</p><p>This person’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the true G.o.d Realm and he was only one step away from the celestial G.o.d Realm. As long as he entered the celestial G.o.d Realm, he would be qualified to become the next Saint.</p><p>There was no need to doubt his combat strength.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming had cultivated the universal myriad Dao mantra, had five divine flames in his body, and had extremely powerful divine energy, he would not have been able to fight against long Xian with only one kind of ruler’s strength and such a huge difference in cultivation.</p><p>Even now, Lu Ming’s combat power was four times stronger after activating the battle character formula. They were equally matched in the collision just now.</p><p>amazing, really amazing. Third stage true G.o.d actually has such combat power. This is still the first time I’ve seen it. Again!</p><p>Long Xian’s eyes were filled with surprise as he charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>This time, the power he used was even stronger.</p><p>“His attack skill has already reached the peak of the fifth level.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>Long Xian’s offensive divine skill had already reached the peak of the fifth level. It was one level higher than Lu Ming’s divine skill. Fortunately, Lu Ming had the support of the battle character formula. Any divine skill that he used would be much more powerful. Otherwise, it would be difficult to resist.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear with both hands and swung it down with all his might. A crescent-shaped spear gleam slashed at long Xian.</p><p>Boom ~!</p><p>The two of them clashed for the second time, but this time, it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Amazing, again!”</p><p>Long Xian let out a long roar and continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also exerted his strength to the extreme.</p><p>The divine power of five divine flames, four times the combat power of the battle character formula, and an exceptionally powerful divine body. Every trace of power was used to fight long Xian.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely on the fighting ring and exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cast the ice chain because he knew that long Xian had a secret skill that he had not cast as well. He had seen it during the sect compet.i.tion.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a pitch-black ray of light burst out from long Xian’s body and shot toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. At this moment, he was highly focused. With a single thought, an ice chain flew out and flew toward the black light.</p><p>Nail!</p><p>The ice chain collided with the black light and a clang was heard. However, Lu Ming’s expression changed as the ice chain shattered during the collision.</p><p>The ice chains could not stop the black light at all.</p><p>After the black light broke the ice chains, it continued to stab toward Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that it was a scorpion’s tail. There was a Black Thorn at the tip of the tail. It was black and shiny, extremely terrifying.</p><p>This was the secret technique of Dragon peril.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Scorpion tail was too fast and it hit Lu Ming in the next moment.</p><p>The nine-layer Crimson Gold armor on Lu Ming’s body shook violently. It could not withstand the attack and was pierced through.</p><p>Lu Ming executed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and retreated rapidly. However, he was still a step too late. He felt a sharp pain in his body. His shoulder had been struck, and a small hole had appeared. Blood was flowing out.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way to the edge of the fighting ring before he stopped.</p><p>“What a powerful secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Long Xian’s scorpion tail secret technique had an astonishing offensive power.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming’s ice chain was inferior to his opponent’s. It was just that Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was too weak. The secret skill would become more powerful as the cultivator’s cultivation level increased.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation reached the ninth stage true G.o.d Realm, the power of the ice shackles would naturally be extremely shocking.</p><p>interesting. There aren’t many true G.o.d Realm experts who can take one of my attacks without being injured. Again.</p><p>Long Xian’s voice was heard. Before he could finish his sentence, he was already charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The Scorpion tail on his body turned into a bolt of Black Lightning and stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and a few ice chains flew out at once.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used three ice chains in total.</p><p>The three ice chains were like three silver Snakes as they flew towards the enemy.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>There were three consecutive sounds of collision. This time, Lu Ming finally managed to block the Scorpion tail attack.</p><p>“He actually blocked it!”</p><p>that’s a secret technique, ice chain!</p><p>Some people recognized Lu Ming’s Secret skill.</p><p>Such a secret skill was available in the Sutra library. Anyone could exchange for it as long as they had points.</p><p>third stage true G.o.d, the power of the ice shackles is already so strong. This is already Grand completion!</p><p>An inner court elder sighed.</p><p>“How does he cultivate? If he wants to cultivate the ice shackles to the large success stage, the Cold Moon Stone is the best choice. Could it be that he has obtained several Cold Moon Stones? how is that possible?”</p><p>The other inner court elder was even more envious.</p><p>This was because he had also cultivated the ice shackles. However, he had cultivated it for many years and had not achieved great success because he did not have the suitable materials.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the intense battle between Lu Ming and long Xian continued.</p><p>The Scorpion tail and the ice chains kept colliding. The long Spears in their hands also kept clashing.</p><p>However, they were still evenly matched.</p><p>I didn’t expect you to be so powerful. You’re the first one to force me to use my ultimate move, Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Long Xian’s voice resounded. In the next moment, another black light burst out from his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
