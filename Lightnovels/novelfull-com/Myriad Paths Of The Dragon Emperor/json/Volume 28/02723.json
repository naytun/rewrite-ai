He compared the purple-robed youth with the winged demon, Fengyuan Dao, madman, and the others. He realized that if they were at the same level, the purple-robed youth was far from being a match for the winged demon, Fengyuan Dao, and the others.</p><p>This was normal. Wing demon, Feng Yuan Dao, and the others were the top ten existences on the outer sect’s virtual G.o.d ranking list. Their combat strength far exceeded those of their peers, and the other outer sect disciples couldn’t compare to them.</p><p>After they entered the inner sect, they would definitely be the elite disciples of the inner sect. Their future prospects would definitely not be comparable to ordinary disciples.</p><p>Although the purple-robed young man was considered an elite in the inner sect, he was still far from the wing demon and the others.</p><p>Although his cultivation had reached the second stage of true G.o.d Realm, his fighting power was probably not as good as Feng Yuan Dao and the others who were at the first stage of true G.o.d Realm. Moreover, Lu Ming’s current strength had improved by leaps and bounds compared to when he was in the dark Dragon secret land. Naturally, it was easy for him to deal with the purple-robed youth.</p><p>you’re still trying to fight for the captain’s position with such weak strength? who else wants the captain’s flag? make your move!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the other eight people.</p><p>A few people’s expressions changed. Their cultivation was on par with the purple-robed young man. Lu Ming could easily crush the purple-robed young man. They were definitely not his match.</p><p>However, not everyone would be afraid.</p><p>“Kid, you’re quite strong. You must be in the top three of the outer sect virtual G.o.d ranking list!”</p><p>The long-faced young man narrowed his eyes and said coldly.</p><p>The others ‘eyes flickered as they came to a realization.</p><p>Only the top three on the virtual G.o.d ranking list would have such terrifying strength.</p><p>you talk too much nonsense. If you want to attack, then hurry up. If you don’t dare, then get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>how presumptuous! I can even defeat the No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Today, I’ll show you the difference between the inner sect and the outer sect.</p><p>The long-faced young man’s eyes were cold. In a flash, he was like a bolt of lightning, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Its speed was shockingly fast. This was a speed-type divine skill. An ordinary person would have been hit before they could even react.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not an ordinary person.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in his hand buzzed and trembled. Then, it burst out and turned into dozens of spear shadows, stabbing in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, the long-faced young man’s figure appeared. He drifted backward and avoided Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>kid, your reaction is quite sharp. Then I’ll suppress you with my power.</p><p>The long-faced young man shouted coldly and his aura of a stage four true G.o.d burst out completely.</p><p>A fourth-stage true G.o.d was much stronger than a second-stage true G.o.d. His divine power was like a turbulent wave, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Meteor spear!”</p><p>With a low growl, the long-faced young man thrust his spear at Lu Ming like a shooting star.</p><p>A terrifying divine technique, under the support of stage four true G.o.d divine power, the power was astonishingly strong.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the double combat power of the battle formula. The divine power in his body circulated at full force. Five divine flames burned fiercely, erupting with shocking power.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used his strongest move. The two spearlights collided in the air like two stars colliding.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A terrifying explosion sounded, and a terrifying force spread out. The others ‘expressions changed, and they retreated, using their divine power to block it.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The scattered energy bombarded the ground and the walls. Even though the ground and walls were made of 100-million-year-old ice, they still left deep scars on them.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a figure retreating. With every step he took, he left a footprint on the ground. He retreated more than a dozen steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>The person who was retreating was the long-faced young man.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually repelled the long-faced young man. How was this possible?</p><p>The long-faced young man had the cultivation of stage four true G.o.d.</p><p>An eighth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert could force back a fourth-level true G.o.d Realm expert. Moreover, he wasn’t an ordinary fourth-level true G.o.d. What kind of monster was he?</p><p>The others could no longer use the word “shocked” to describe their feelings. They simply thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>“This is impossible …”</p><p>The long-faced young man was also in disbelief.</p><p>you have some strength. A stage four true G.o.d is indeed powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming also thought to himself.</p><p>The fourth stage true G.o.d Realm was much stronger than the second stage true G.o.d Realm. Even Lu Ming would find it difficult to defeat him.</p><p>an hai, let’s attack together. Let’s attack together and suppress this brat.</p><p>At this moment, the long-faced young man shouted. He was calling the burly young man.</p><p>In this group of people, only he and the burly teenager an hai had the highest cultivation, reaching the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm. The others were all at the second or third stage of true G.o.d Realm and were not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>An hai stepped forward. An iron rod appeared in his hand. It was pitch-black, and it looked extremely heavy.</p><p>“Kid, your power is beyond my expectations. As long as you can defeat the two of us, I will recognize you as the leader. No, in the future, you will be my boss and I will follow you.”</p><p>An hai said in a deep voice. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>“As you wish, make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The long-faced young man shouted and charged at Lu Ming with all his might. He used the meteor spear to its maximum.</p><p>At the same time, an hai made his move. His iron rod was like a mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>When the two of them joined forces, their strength was unleashed to the extreme. Their power was like an avalanche. Even Lu Ming did not dare to be careless.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming triggered it continuously and finally punished the battle character formula by three times.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the three apocalyptic strikes again. The two spear lights collided with the long-faced young man and an hai.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few collisions, the two figures retreated.</p><p>It was an hai and the long-faced young man. After Lu Ming’s combat strength was tripled, the two of them were even more outmatched and were being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>As the two of them retreated, Lu Ming immediately followed up. The Spear’s gleam was like a mountain pillar, pressing down on the two of them.</p><p>The two of them roared and tried their best to block, but they couldn’t. The spear light pressed down, and the two of them coughed up blood. Their bodies were pushed back violently, and they hit the wall. The wall that was made of 100-million-year-old profound ice almost shattered.</p><p>The two of them vomited blood and their faces were as pale as paper. They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Heavens, this, this …”</p><p>The others were also shocked beyond words. It was as if there was a lump of dog hair stuck in their throats, and they couldn’t stop trembling.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the hall shook. His fighting spirit was high.</p><p>“Wait, I’m not fighting anymore, I’m not fighting anymore, I surrender …”</p><p>An hai was the first to call out. He looked at Lu Ming with respect and deep admiration.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re a pervert. I, an hai, am a man of my word. Since you’ve defeated us, you’re the team leader and my boss from now on.”</p><p>An hai patted his chest.</p><p>Lu Ming did not comment. He looked at the long-faced young man and said,”What about you? do you still want to fight?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
