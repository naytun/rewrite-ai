He retreated a distance and did not continue to attack.</p><p>QiuQiu wanted to rush out several times but was stopped by Lu Ming. After all, there were so many descendants of ancient G.o.ds present. He was really a little afraid that QiuQiu would cause some trouble.</p><p>Gu Bo and the others tried all sorts of methods, but none of them worked.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, streaks of rainbow light flew over from the distance. It was as if meteors were raining down from the sky, and it was a very spectacular sight.</p><p>The other people on the ancient G.o.d Star had finally arrived.</p><p>“This … Could it be the ancient G.o.ds Mountain?”</p><p>“Didn’t our zone leader go to the ancient G.o.ds Mountain? Why did the ancient G.o.ds Mountain appear on its own?”</p><p>what a huge door. What’s that? ”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>One figure after another flew to ancient G.o.ds Mountain and the bronze gate.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Gu Bo shouted in anger, his heavenly G.o.d Realm aura spreading out, causing these people to be shocked and retreat.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d Star was occupied by the Dominators. The highest cultivation of those Dominators was only peak real G.o.d and most of them had died in the ancient G.o.d mountain. The people who came now were not more than stage six of true G.o.d. Under the pressure of Gu Bo, they naturally did not dare to act rashly.</p><p>However, as time pa.s.sed, more and more people arrived. They filled the sky, and the number was uncountable.</p><p>Gu Bo let out a long sigh. With so many people, even if his cultivation was high, he couldn’t suppress them.</p><p>Moreover, the news would probably spread out very quickly. At that time, the major powers of the Qin heaven Starfield would descend, and they would be even more helpless.</p><p>In fact, the news had already spread.</p><p>There were not only natives on the ancient G.o.d Star. There were also disciples like Lu Ming who came from the Qin heaven thirteen clans to train on the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>They had already spread the news of the ancient G.o.d star’s change and the bronze gate.</p><p>“Grand Elder, what should we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked Gu Bo and the others.</p><p>Now, the ancient G.o.ds Mountain had been completely occupied by others. There were people everywhere, and they could no longer suppress the situation.</p><p>“Let’s go, leave this place. We’ll find another place to live. This place is no longer suitable for living.”</p><p>Gu Bo heaved a long sigh, feeling very helpless.</p><p>The other descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were also helpless.</p><p>However, they knew that this place was indeed not suitable for living. When the powerful forces of the Qin heaven Star Domain descended, they would definitely not be able to protect the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. If they were not careful, they might even face the calamity of extermination.</p><p>“Let’s go, Lu Ming. We’re leaving. Take care.”</p><p>Gu Bo cupped his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s meet again if there’s a chance.”</p><p>Gu Xing also walked over to bid her farewell.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had caused Gu Xiong to be on the verge of death, Gu Xing did not blame him. She knew that Gu Xiong had brought all of this upon himself. Moreover, Lu Ming had also saved most of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>“Take care. We’ll meet again if there’s a chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>&Nbsp; the descendants of the ancient G.o.d race all left and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>As soon as the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds left, the crowd immediately flew toward the gate of ancient G.o.d, trying to open it.</p><p>Of course, the gate of ancient G.o.d couldn’t be opened with just a large number of people. No matter how hard they tried, they still couldn’t open it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming quietly approached the ancient G.o.d’s Gate.</p><p>“Little guy, do whatever you want to do, but be careful.”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed QiuQiu.</p><p>Giggle!</p><p>QiuQiu immediately scuttled out, opened its mouth wide, and bit at the bronze door.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He stared at it nervously.</p><p>Creak, creak, creak …</p><p>QiuQiu bit the bronze door ruthlessly, emitting an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bronze door trembled, and a terrifying pressure spread out.</p><p>“Ah, what’s going on?”</p><p>“Nest …”</p><p>Many people were directly sent flying by this pressure.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>QiuQiu bit even harder and gnawed with all its might. Its sharp teeth actually bit into the bronze door.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>At this moment, wisps of lightning spread out from the bronze door, emitting terrifying energy fluctuations.</p><p>“Not good, QiuQiu, quickly retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly shouted.</p><p>That was because the wisps of lightning were spreading towards QiuQiu.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>QiuQiu mustered all its strength and bit with all its might. Finally, he bit off a small piece of bronze and retreated frantically, but it was already too late.</p><p>A wisp of lightning struck QiuQiu’s body, and QiuQiu was sent flying.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He ran in the direction where QiuQiu was blasted and saw that QiuQiu had crashed heavily on the ground and was no longer moving.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart beat wildly. He ran over hurriedly and realized that QiuQiu’s entire body was black, as if it had been burnt.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>However, in the next moment, QiuQiu’s round body rolled twice, and its big mouth appeared again, biting a few times with a ‘giggle’ sound.</p><p>This guy was fine.</p><p>Lu Ming felt at ease.</p><p>“You, this guy, you’re even willing to throw away your life for food.”</p><p>Lu Ming carried QiuQiu and scolded jokingly.</p><p>QiuQiu transformed into a bangle and wrapped itself around Lu Ming’s wrist. Its aura was very weak. QiuQiu had been struck by the lightning from the bronze door and was severely injured.</p><p>“I should leave first!”</p><p>Many people were already looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming left the ancient G.o.ds Mountain and came to a mountain more than 100000 miles away. He observed the changes of the mountain from a distance.</p><p>More and more people gathered around the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>A few days later, there was indeed an important figure who arrived.</p><p>A terrifying character descended from the sect closest to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans.</p><p>This person was enveloped in a divine light, emitting a terrifying pressure. Everyone was suppressed by this pressure and almost vomited blood. They all retreated frantically, leaving the bronze door.</p><p>The figure stood alone in front of the bronze door.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The figure suddenly made a move. A terrifying divine light blasted towards the bronze door, trying to blast it open.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent boom erupted from the bronze door, but after the boom, the bronze door remained unmoving.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>die! the figure shouted. His divine power burned like flames, and an even more terrifying aura burst out.</p><p>Many people’s bodies trembled and they spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They were almost crushed to death.</p><p>“Back, back off!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Countless people retreated in a frenzy, terrified.</p><p>“What a terrifying aura!”</p><p>Even though he was more than a hundred thousand miles away, Lu Ming could feel a terrifying pressure pressing down on him. He could only retreat. He only felt better after retreating another hundred thousand miles.</p><p>“Kid, that’s a G.o.d King!”</p><p>Bone said indifferently.</p><p>“He’s indeed a G.o.dking!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. This was the first time he had seen the king of G.o.ds in action. The power was truly earth-shattering and could swallow mountains and rivers. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>If one were to say that heavenly deities were the experts of the Qin heaven star region, then G.o.dkings were definitely Overlord-level characters of the Qin heaven star region.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
