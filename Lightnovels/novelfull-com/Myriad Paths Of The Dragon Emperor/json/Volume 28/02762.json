Lu Ming looked over.</p><p>Over there, there was a round ball floating in the air, shining brightly. It was QiuQiu.</p><p>it seems like QiuQiu is going to advance to the true G.o.d stage.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Over the years, QiuQiu had swallowed a large number of divine weapon fragments, and its level had also been constantly rising. It was about to rise to true G.o.d-level.</p><p>Not long after, QiuQiu officially broke through. Its aura was powerful, and it reached first stage true G.o.d.</p><p>It then flew toward Lu Ming, turned into a bracelet, and wore it on his wrist.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the place. He went to look for ancient books and records to see if there were any ways to improve the divine body.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming buried himself in reading various books and finally found a method.</p><p>“Ancient G.o.d flower!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>&Nbsp; according to the ancient records, there was a divine flower called the ancient G.o.d flower. It was extremely mysterious and after consuming it, one’s divine body would evolve and become stronger.</p><p>However, the ancient G.o.d flower only existed in one place in the entire Qin heaven star system, and that was the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>According to the ancient records, the ancient G.o.d Star was occupied by a race in the distant past. This race was known as the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. They had the bloodline of the ancient G.o.ds and their divine bodies were stronger than those of the other races.</p><p>Only this race knew how to plant the ancient G.o.d flower.</p><p>This race was not considered a big race in the Qin heaven star system. It was just a small race. However, it had disappeared in the distant past.</p><p>Of course, the ancient G.o.d flower had also gone extinct.</p><p>after flipping through so many ancient books, this is the most reliable method. Let’s try our luck.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and decided to try his luck on the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>He definitely couldn’t give up on the battle symbol art. This was an ancient origin word, and its value was immeasurable. If he gave up on the battle symbol art, it would have a huge impact on his combat strength.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming set off to the teleportation platform and headed to the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming went to the teleportation platform, he was targeted.</p><p>The two young men followed from a distance and also arrived at the transportation platform.</p><p>“It seems like I’m not the only one who wants to kill this kid. Hehe.”</p><p>Behind these two young men, there was another person, le Zhong.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about this. He walked into the teleportation array and teleported away.</p><p>“May I ask where that person was teleported to?”</p><p>The two young men came to the teleportation formation and asked a burly man who was guarding it.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you where he’s going.”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>There were rules for them to guard the teleportation formation, which was to keep it a secret.</p><p>I’m telling you, we were sent by the sacred son of reflection. Now, the sacred son of reflection wants to know where that kid is. Are you going to offend the sacred son of reflection? ”</p><p>A young man said coldly.</p><p>The burly man’s face turned pale.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to offend someone at the Saint level. Once he did, he wouldn’t even know how he died.</p><p>“He … He’s going to …”</p><p>The burly man told them about Lu Ming’s whereabouts in a trembling voice.</p><p>The two young men sneered. They stepped into the teleportation formation and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>After the two young men left, le Zhong came forward and revealed his ident.i.ty as the Tian Hong Saint son. The burly man naturally did not dare to offend him and informed him of Lu Ming’s whereabouts. Le Zhong also stepped into the teleportation formation and chased after him.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect couldn’t reach the ancient G.o.d planet directly, so they could only teleport to a nearby planet and fly there on an interstellar warship.</p><p>After more than a month of traveling, Lu Ming finally arrived in the sky above the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d Star was huge and it rotated slowly in the starry sky. Lu Ming sat on the starry sky warship and flew around the ancient G.o.d Star, observing it carefully.</p><p>Legend had it that the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds lived on a divine mountain called the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. However, for some unknown reason, the ancient G.o.ds Mountain suddenly disappeared from the ancient G.o.ds star and never appeared again.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain because the ancient G.o.d flower could only be found there.</p><p>However, he didn’t find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain even after circling the ancient G.o.d Star several times in the interplanetary warship.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to choose a random place and land.</p><p>After entering the atmosphere, Lu Ming kept the starry sky warship and flew towards a big city below.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming landed, two interstellar battleships flew over and landed. They were the two young experts from the floating light Faction and le Zhong.</p><p>Lu Ming landed in the big city.</p><p>The big city was very prosperous. There were many races, and people came and went. It was very lively.</p><p>In the distant past, the ancient G.o.d Star had been under the control of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. However, since the disappearance of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, the ancient G.o.d Star had fallen into chaos. Countless forces were born, and they fought with each other until now.</p><p>have you heard? another family has been annihilated.</p><p>I’ve heard about it too. It’s really tragic. The entire family was killed, not even a chicken or dog was left. This is the fifth family in this area to be destroyed in the past three months.</p><p>“I wonder who did it? Why did you exterminate these families? these families are just small families.”</p><p>those who can do this must be the major forces.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming entered the city, he heard a series of discussions.</p><p>let me tell you, I heard a piece of news. It is said that all of this is because of the ancient G.o.d map.</p><p>Suddenly, someone said in a low voice.</p><p>“Ancient G.o.d map?”</p><p>The others were puzzled.</p><p>it’s the ancient G.o.d map. With this map, you can find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain where the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds are.</p><p>That person said.</p><p>“What? Can you find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain where the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds live?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>legend has it that the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were exterminated for some reason. However, there are a lot of treasures left by the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds in the ancient G.o.d mountain. It is said that whoever can find the ancient G.o.d mountain and obtain the treasures inside can unify the ancient G.o.d Star and become the Overlord of the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>that’s right, the ancient G.o.d map. Could it be real? ”</p><p>Many people exclaimed in shock and excitement.</p><p>it’s most likely true. It’s said that it appeared in the nearby area and was controlled by a family. That’s why the families were destroyed one after another.</p><p>The person from before said.</p><p>These words set off a huge uproar and spread wider and wider.</p><p>can you find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain on the ancient G.o.ds map? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was better to come at the right time than to come early.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to hear about the ancient G.o.ds Mountain as soon as he arrived.</p><p>since families have been destroyed one after another, I guess there will be another one. I’ll go to these families and wait. Maybe I can find some clues.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then asked around.</p><p>In this area, there were a total of nine great clans. Five of them had already been destroyed, and there were still four left.</p><p>“Let’s go to this Fu clan.”</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a family. After figuring out the route, he headed in that direction.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming had flown for a distance, two young men appeared in front of him and blocked his way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
