Existences at the sixth stage of true G.o.d Realm were naturally not enough.</p><p>The others looked around and did not fight for it.</p><p>An ancient G.o.d flower was not worth it.</p><p>Even more people rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>Perhaps there were more ancient G.o.d flowers in the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look but did not make a move.</p><p>An ancient G.o.d flower had limited uses, so there was no need to reveal their true strength in advance.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and headed deep into the valley.</p><p>As expected, more and more ancient G.o.d flowers appeared in the depths of the valley. Every time an ancient G.o.d flower appeared, it would cause a huge battle. Many people would fight for it.</p><p>Although the cultivation of divine power was the main focus of the primal universe, the strength of the divine body was also very important.</p><p>Some secret skills had requirements for the strength of the divine body.</p><p>Furthermore, the stronger the divine body, the stronger the life force. Treasures that could improve the divine body were all very precious, so the compet.i.tion was naturally intense.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not make a move. He increased his speed and rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>“Kid, be careful. Someone is trying to kill you.”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Someone wants to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not freeze for a moment. He was on guard.</p><p>“Wait, this sound …”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming stopped in his tracks, his face filled with shock.</p><p>That was because the voice that had just sounded in his sea of consciousness was very unfamiliar. It was not the voice of the measure formula or the battle formula, but another voice.</p><p>However, in his sea of consciousness, besides the quant.i.ty formula and the battle formula, was there anything else?</p><p>“Who is it? Who is in my sea of consciousness?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted with his mental energy.</p><p>“Kid, there’s something in your painting!”</p><p>This time, it was the sound of the quant.i.ty formula.</p><p>A painting?</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thought of Jingyu’s portrait. However, the remnant mark that Jingyu had left behind had already disappeared. The portrait on it had also disappeared. Could there be something else in the portrait?</p><p>“Kid, what’s there to be surprised about? ever since you obtained Jingyu’s portrait, I’ve been around. I’ve been observing you all this time, but you just didn’t notice me.”</p><p>The unfamiliar voice from before rang out once more, and as expected, it came from the portrait of Jing Yu.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming was surprised to see an arm stretching out from the portrait.</p><p>However, this arm was not made of flesh and blood. It was a piece of bone that was black in color, as if it was made of black jade.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a skeleton crawl out of Jing Yu’s portrait. It was a skeleton that was as black as Jade.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>There was actually a skeleton hidden within the startled feather painting.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Who was this skeleton?</p><p>Could it be Jing Yu himself?</p><p>In an instant, dozens of thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Brat, don’t be too surprised. I’ve told you that someone wants to kill you. They’re already close. If you want to die, then continue to be in a daze.”</p><p>The skeleton continued.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately collected his thoughts. As expected, he felt waves of cold aura spreading towards him. At the same time, a dark-skinned elder rapidly approached Lu Ming and a sword-light stabbed at the back of Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>Fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>It was done in one go, a one-hit kill.</p><p>Furthermore, it was shockingly powerful. If not for the black skeleton’s warning, Lu Ming would have been in danger.</p><p>However, after the black skeleton’s reminder, Lu Ming had already reacted in advance. In an instant, Lu Ming had already cast the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. A layer of Crimson Gold armor covered his entire body.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming quickly turned around and thrust his spear, aiming at the sword gleam.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear and the sword light clashed, creating an ear-piercing collision sound, and the force spread in all directions.</p><p>However, the power of the sword-light was shockingly strong. The terrifying sword Qi made the long spear vibrate continuously. Then, it pa.s.sed through the long spear and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s golden-red armor shook violently and was torn apart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward, smashing into a hundred-meter-tall Boulder. His body was covered with sword wounds and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Fortunately, the sword gleam pa.s.sed through the spear and the Scarlet Gold armor one after another. Its power was no longer strong, and Lu Ming only suffered some superficial injuries.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The dark-skinned elder was stunned that he did not manage to kill Lu Ming with one strike. He seemed to be very surprised.</p><p>“Who are you? Why do you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the dark-skinned elder and shouted coldly.</p><p>This old man’s strength was very terrifying. His cultivation was at peak stage nine true G.o.d and he controlled King grade divine power.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current abilities, if he were to go all out, he could fight with an ordinary ninth stage true G.o.d. However, if he were to encounter a peak ninth stage true G.o.d, he would most likely be no match for him. Moreover, the other party had also mastered King-grade divine power, and his abilities were far above his.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming did not know this old man.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The dark-skinned elder did not say anything. He shouted coldly and pounced at Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>Before he even arrived, streaks of terrifying sword light were already pouring down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind flickered and eight ice chains flew out like eight long Dragons, entangling the swarthy elder.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>His opponent’s sword-light kept striking the ice chains, causing sparks to fly. The ice chains kept shaking, and sword marks appeared on them. However, they still managed to block his attack.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying chill spread towards the dark-skinned elder, causing him to shiver.</p><p>secret skill, ice shackles. This kid has actually cultivated the ice shackles.</p><p>The dark-skinned elder was shocked. Then, he growled and an even more terrifying divine power burst out from his body. Sword light burst forth continuously, shaking off the ice chains that were binding him and heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“The three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed and used his strongest move. A crescent-shaped attack was aimed at the swarthy elder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided once again, and a shocking force erupted between them.</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>On the side, the others were shocked and retreated. A few of the weaker ones were killed by the energy from the collision.</p><p>what terrifying strength. Who are these two? they’re even stronger than many domain Lords.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Perhaps only the most terrifying domain Lords on the ancient G.o.d Star could match such a fighting power.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The dark-skinned elder roared as divine power poured into his body. The sword light expanded and Lu Ming’s body trembled. He was sent flying backward and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Now is the time …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and another ice chain flew out from his body.</p><p>This was the last ice chain, and it was also the strongest one. It was the one that had been refined into a mysterious liquid.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
