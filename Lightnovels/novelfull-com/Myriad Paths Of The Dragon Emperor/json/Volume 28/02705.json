No matter what kind of G.o.dly skill it was, under the enhancement of the battle symbol art, its power would increase by a level.</p><p>In addition, as he continued to comprehend the battle formula, he could trigger double, triple, or even four, five, or even more times of combat power.</p><p>It was infinitely mysterious and unfathomable!</p><p>As for the word ‘measure’, it was also one of the ancient words of origin. What kind of mystery could it have?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>“Brat, you’re lucky. I’ve stayed on that nether Dragon for countless years. That beast doesn’t have the slightest intelligence, how can it be worthy of me? There’s no future at all!”</p><p>I just happened to run into you guys and saw that you were controlling ‘Zhan’, so I left the nether Dragon and ran to you. Otherwise, how could you have killed the nether Dragon so easily? ”</p><p>Liang continued.</p><p>Lu Ming rejoiced inwardly. It turned out that ‘Liang’ did not think highly of the netherdragon beast King. Furthermore, because Lu Ming had mastered the ‘battle formula’, the’ Liang formula ‘had voluntarily left the netherdragon beast King. Otherwise, they would be in real danger.</p><p>“Oh right, since you have a spirit and can communicate, why can’t the ‘battle’ formula communicate?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>who says he doesn’t know how to communicate? he’s just trying to be coy, and he’s pretending to be profound!</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula said in disdain.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Suddenly, a deep male voice sounded. It was clearly from the ‘battle’ symbol art.</p><p>Lu Ming was flabbergasted. The battle symbol art really had spirituality and could speak. However, Lu Ming had obtained the battle symbol art for so many years but he had never heard it speak.</p><p>In the past, he had thought that the battle character formula was only an ancient character and would not have any spirituality. Now, he realized that he was completely wrong.</p><p>“Hey, what did you just say? You dare to say that I’m talking nonsense? I dare you to say that again!”</p><p>The ” Liang ” character roared in anger, its voice sharp.</p><p>Fortunately, these voices only rang in Lu Ming’s mind. People outside could not hear them.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>The deep voice of the battle symbol art sounded again.</p><p>“You … You … I’m too lazy to bother with you!”</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula seemed to be quite angry. The words were shaking, which was very human-like.</p><p>Lu Ming found it rather interesting.</p><p>by the way, the battle formula can increase one’s combat power. What’s the mystery of your ‘quant.i.ty’ formula? ”</p><p>Lu Ming finally could not help but ask what he was thinking.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ve been very useful. Kid, let me tell you. Each ancient word of origin has its own profoundness. Since old general is using the word” measure,”it’s naturally related to energy,”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“Is it related to energy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>“That’s right. That nether Dragon was attacking us non-stop. Did you think that its energy seemed to be endless?”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“That’s right. Is it because of you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he asked.</p><p>of course it’s because of me. My first function is that you can store your cultivation energy in my body. When you need it, you can directly borrow this power. I’ll store as much as you have!</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“You can actually do this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes immediately glowed and his heart was pounding.</p><p>He now had a weakness. His cultivation was too weak, and his divine power was not strong enough. When he used divine skills, he had to calculate and not use them recklessly. Otherwise, his divine power would be easily exhausted.</p><p>But with the ” measure ” formula, as long as he stored more Shen power in the ” measure ” formula, he would not have to worry about running out of Shen power in the battle.</p><p>In that case, his strength would increase by another level, because he could use big moves at any time.</p><p>He finally knew why the nether Dragon beast King’s energy light pillar could shoot out non-stop. It was because it had stored a large amount of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with pa.s.sion.</p><p>“Brat, do you think that this is all of my profoundness? you’re gravely mistaken!”</p><p>The slightly proud voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded again.</p><p>“What other mysteries do you have?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating wildly.</p><p>I’m telling you, I can absorb many different kinds of energy. All kinds of energy, when absorbed into my body, can be transformed into your Shen power, and can directly improve your cultivation!</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said again.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was so shocked that he almost screamed.</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula could actually absorb different types of energy and then turn them into the Shen power he needed, directly increasing his cultivation.</p><p>This function was simply heaven-defying!</p><p>“How is it? Aren’t my functions heaven-defying? Isn’t your “battle” word a lot stronger?”</p><p>The ” Liang ” character chuckled, feeling extremely proud.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how to answer.</p><p>Although the quant.i.ty formula was heaven-defying, the battle formula could continuously multiply one’s combat power when cultivated to a profound level. It was also heaven-defying.</p><p>It was not easy to compare the two as they each had their own strengths.</p><p>kid, you’re lucky. I’ll stay here with you for the time being. If you follow me, I’ll guarantee you a good life and become an expert who can dominate the universe!</p><p>The “Liang” character muttered with a chuckle.</p><p>“You seem to have followed many people in the past, but they are all dead. So, it’s better to be low-key!”</p><p>At this moment, the deep voice of the battle symbol art sounded.</p><p>“Hey, you’re deliberately making things difficult for me, right? Are you not convinced? Come, come, come, if you’re not convinced, let’s have a fight!”</p><p>The Liang character formula shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming had a headache. The quant.i.ty formula was indeed heaven-defying. However, the only disadvantage was that it spoke too much. It seemed that it would be difficult to be at peace in the future.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly felt a sense of danger. He felt a powerful energy in the sky crashing down on him.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming mustered all his remaining strength and jumped to the side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A burst of fist force hit the spot where Lu Ming was just a moment ago, blasting a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>your spiritual sense is sharp. You can still avoid my move even with an injured body!</p><p>A voice filled with killing intent came from the sky.</p><p>“Mad Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his face gloomy.</p><p>The one who sneaked an attack on him was the little tyrant, Kuang Dao, who was ranked fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m here today to take your life!”</p><p>Kuang Dao shouted.</p><p>His eyes swept across the scene. When he saw the corpses of the nether Dragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower on the ground, his eyes became extremely fiery.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had actually killed so many nether Dragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers. He was shocked.</p><p>At the same time, he was overjoyed. He knew that he had made the right decision to come. Although Lu Ming and the rest had killed a large number of nether Dragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers, they were severely injured.</p><p>you’re a defeated opponent, yet you still dare to appear in front of me. You can stay here forever!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, don’t try to scare me. You’re strong enough to kill so many nether Dragons, but you’re all heavily injured now. You can’t even use ten percent of your strength, and you still want to kill me?”</p><p>Kuang Dao laughed and was extremely arrogant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
