At this moment, the surface of this piece of metal was shimmering with light, as if it was resonating with something.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. They finally understood why there were so many families being annihilated in the vicinity.</p><p>That was because protectorate Lord Youfeng had sensed the appearance of a little soul gold in this area through the little soul gold. It was highly likely that it was the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain. However, he wasn’t sure of the exact location. Thus, the clans went over one by one and searched for it.</p><p>However, he was afraid of being criticized by others, so he had all his subordinates wear black robes and mask their faces.</p><p>“But … But my Fu family really doesn’t have any soul gold.”</p><p>The fu clan head called out, his face full of helplessness.</p><p>“Father, father, could it be related to the batch of ancient objects I bought last time?”</p><p>At this moment, a young man came to the side of the fu family’s head and whispered.</p><p>“Antique?”</p><p>The fu clan head was stunned.</p><p>yes, I bought a batch of ancient objects last time and wanted to study them to see if they have any value. One of the scrolls has a similar color to this soul gold, ” w.a.n.g Yao said.</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Region master Youfeng’s eyes lit up when he heard the young man’s words.</p><p>“What? There’s such a thing. Hurry, hurry up and take it out.”</p><p>The head of the fu clan hurriedly called out.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man nodded and took out a storage ring. The storage ring glowed, and a pile of antiques appeared in the air. They didn’t seem to have any spirituality, but they looked very simple and were full of the traces of time.</p><p>Especially one of the scrolls, the color was really similar to the soul gold, but the color was much darker.</p><p>When these items were taken out, the soul gold in protectorate Lord Youfeng’s hand immediately shone with a dazzling light. Then, the ancient scroll suddenly shone brightly and resonated with the soul gold.</p><p>hahaha, the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. It’s really the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. Give it to me.</p><p>Region master wandering wind burst out laughing.</p><p>The master of the fu family quickly grabbed the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain and said, ” “Protectorate Lord wandering wind, I’ll hand this map to you. You must promise to let my Fu clan go.”</p><p>alright, I promise you. Now, hurry up and hand it over to me.</p><p>Region master wandering wind said hurriedly.</p><p>The fu clan’s master muttered to himself for a moment. With a wave of his hand, the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain flew towards protectorate Lord Youfeng and was caught by him.</p><p>After he caught it in his hand, he hurriedly opened it to take a look, and his expression became even happier.</p><p>“Hahaha, I finally got it. Now, since you have handed over the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain, I will give your Fu clan a quick death.”</p><p>Region master Youfeng said coldly.</p><p>“What? You … Didn’t you say you would let our Fu clan go? You didn’t keep your word.”</p><p>The patriarch of the fu family roared.</p><p>“Credibility? Hmph, last time, I sent more than two hundred people here, and all of them died in your Fu clan. If your Fu clan isn’t destroyed, how can I face my subordinates?”</p><p>Region master Youfeng said coldly. His eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>He had no intention of letting the fu clan go from the very beginning.</p><p>“Hehe, you Feng, you’re still as despicable as ever.”</p><p>At this moment, a sneer came from the sky. It was filled with mockery.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Region master Youfeng’s expression changed as he looked at the sky.</p><p>“Youfeng, you can’t even recognize my voice?”</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a few figures appeared in that direction.</p><p>The leader of the group was a skinny middle-aged man.</p><p>“Xiang Shan, it’s you.” Region master wandering wind’s expression changed.</p><p>the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region. It’s the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region.</p><p>Someone from the fu clan exclaimed.</p><p>“It seems like it’s another domain lord.”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>The region Lord Youfeng ruled this region while the region Lord Xiangshan should be the Overlord who ruled the other region.</p><p>“Of course it’s me. You Feng, do you want to keep the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain for yourself? Just hand it over!”</p><p>The domain lord of the elephant Mountain region said coldly.</p><p>Hmph, you want to take the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain from me by yourself? in your dreams.</p><p>Protectorate Lord Youfeng waved the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain in his hand and was about to put it away in his storage ring.</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light shot towards protectorate Lord Youfeng’s palm at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The attack came from behind protectorate Lord Youfeng. It was one of his subordinates.</p><p>Protectorate Lord Youfeng had never expected that his subordinate would attack him. He wanted to Dodge, but it was too late. His palm was. .h.i.t and exploded. The ancient G.o.d map flew out.</p><p>“Great Guardian, you’re looking for death.”</p><p>die! region master Youfeng roared in anger. He circulated his divine power and quickly repaired his broken palm.</p><p>The person who had attacked him just now was the number one expert under him. He was an existence at the seventh stage of true G.o.d Realm and was his great protector.</p><p>The great protector retreated quickly to prevent region master Youfeng from attacking.</p><p>“Hahaha, let me tell you, your Grand Guardian has long since secretly joined my side.”</p><p>The domain lord of the elephant Mountain region laughed and pounced towards the ancient G.o.ds Mountain Map.</p><p>don’t even think about taking my map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain. Kill him!</p><p>Region Lord Youfeng roared and pounced towards the ancient G.o.ds Mountain Map. At the same time, a violent attack was continuously launched towards the Xiang Shan region Lord.</p><p>The domain lord of the elephant Mountain region was not afraid at all. He also launched an attack. The two of them collided continuously, and their forces spread in all directions.</p><p>Fortunately, the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain was made of soul Touch Gold and was extremely hard. It rolled in the strong Qi and was unharmed.</p><p>The elephant Mountain region master was also at the stage eight of the true G.o.d Realm. His fighting power was not any weaker than the wandering wind region master. The two of them exchanged blows continuously, but neither of them could gain the upper hand. For a moment, neither of them obtained the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>However, just as you Feng and Xiang Shan were fighting fiercely, a figure in the sky pounced at the ancient G.o.ds Mountain Map at a very fast speed and grabbed it.</p><p>This was a member of the wings race. He had a pair of green wings on his back, and when he flapped them, his speed was astonishing.</p><p>“Domain lord Yuhan, it’s you.”</p><p>attack! region Lord Youfeng and region Lord Xiangshan shouted at the same time. They couldn’t be bothered with fighting and attacked the wings race man at the same time.</p><p>Another domain lord had arrived. It was none other than the domain lord Yuhan.</p><p>Originally, domain lord Yu Han was about to get the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. However, the combined attacks of domain lord Youfeng and domain lord Xiang Shan were extremely powerful. He had no choice but to give up on the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain and defend himself with all his might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Domain lord Yu Han was forced to retreat. Meanwhile, the domain lord you Feng and the domain lord Xiang Shan pounced toward the ancient G.o.ds Mountain Map and started fighting again.</p><p>Domain master Yuhan’s face was gloomy. She also pounced forward. The three domain masters were engaged in a battle. Everyone wanted the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain, but no one could get it.</p><p>The fu family people were all stunned, they didn’t expect to attract three domain Lords.</p><p>The map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain was flying around in the air.</p><p>a map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with desire. Wasn’t he here to find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain?
