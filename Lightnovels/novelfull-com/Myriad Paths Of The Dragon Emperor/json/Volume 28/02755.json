He held his sword and met the attack. The sword whistled non-stop and the sword light rushed towards the blood red a.s.sociation’s President.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In an instant, there were dozens of explosions between the two of them. Then, a figure retreated. It was the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Against the blood red a.s.sociation’s President who was at true G.o.d stage five, the ancestor of technique was suppressed and not his match.</p><p>“Hmph, no matter how strong he is, he’s going to die this time.”</p><p>The palace Master of the underworld Palace said coldly.</p><p>“Of course. The outcome has already been decided, and it can’t be changed,”</p><p>Situ haonan said confidently.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The president of the blood red a.s.sociation had the upper hand in one strike. Naturally, he would not miss the opportunity and launched a violent attack on the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“A stage five true G.o.d is nothing more than this.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s long hair fluttered in the wind, and his aura was wild. His battle intent reached its peak, and his divine power burst forth. Instead of retreating, he advanced and charged at the sanguine red guild leader.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them collided once again. However, when the blade and the sword clashed, the aura on the ancestor of technique’s body suddenly increased. The sword shone with a dazzling light and actually suppressed the sanguine red guild leader.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sanguine red guild leader’s body shook violently, and he was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>stage four true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>The sanguine red guild leader roared.</p><p>“What? Fourth stage true G.o.d Realm, fa Ming has broken through to the fourth stage true G.o.d Realm.”</p><p>“How can he break through so quickly? d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others shouted in shock.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s strength was originally incomparably powerful. If he was at stage three true G.o.d Realm, he naturally wouldn’t be the blood red president’s match. But after breaking through to stage four true G.o.d Realm, it was a different story.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The ancestor of technique became one with his sword and turned into a bright sword light, attacking the sanguine red guild leader.</p><p>The sanguine red President roared and used all his strength to fight against the ancestor of technique.

He was no match for the ancestor of technique and was forced to retreat with blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Quickly help me, quickly help me!”</p><p>The sanguine red guild leader roared. He was truly a little afraid now. If this continued, he might be killed by the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Let’s attack together. Now is the time for the two sides to fight. There’s no need to talk about so many rules in a battle between two armies. Let’s kill him together!”</p><p>“That’s right, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan both shouted. They were completely shameless.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, one figure after another stepped out and rushed towards the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Kang Ji, mo kan, situ haonan …</p><p>There were a total of nine experts, all of whom were at the stage four true G.o.d Realm. Including the sanguine red guild leader, there were a total of ten people.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The top ten experts joined forces and launched a terrifying attack at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Facing the joint attack of so many experts, the ancestor of technique didn’t dare to be careless. He counterattacked with all his strength, and both sides started an intense fight.</p><p>The two sides fought, but two fists were no match for four hands. The ancestor of technique was only one person after all. Facing the siege of the top ten experts, he slowly fell into a disadvantage.</p><p>despicable! A bunch of despicable and shameless people!</p><p>“So many people are attacking the general.”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army roared in anger. Unfortunately, no one could interfere in such a battle.</p><p>After all, the righteous Army had only been established for a short period of time and didn’t have any stage four true G.o.d Realm experts. In the past, it was completely carried by the ancestor of technique alone. Therefore, they could only watch. If they went up, they would only be a hindrance and distract the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ancestor of technique was careless and was. .h.i.t by a palm. His body was forced back and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Fa Ming, go to h.e.l.l, go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared ferociously and took the opportunity to attack the ancestor of technique. He wanted to kill the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Kang Ji, I’m afraid that you’re still far from being able to kill me. Sword body technique.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique let out a long howl. His body suddenly burst forth with endless sword Qi. His entire person seemed to have transformed into a peerless divine sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi shot out from the Battle Sword in the ancestor of technique’s hand and slashed towards Kang Ji. The terrifying power made Kang Ji’s expression change.</p><p>Kang Ji tried his best to block it. However, as the sword light pa.s.sed through, Kang Ji’s defense was shattered. He screamed and flew out. A half-meter long sword wound appeared on his body, almost cutting him in half.</p><p>secret skill. You’ve actually cultivated a secret skill.</p><p>Kang Ji roared in shock.</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>There are still some ordinary secret skills in the chaotic astral River. However, there are very few secret skills that can increase one’s combat strength.</p><p>And the ancestor of technique had obviously cultivated a secret technique that could increase his combat power.</p><p>“Interesting. I want this secret technique.”</p><p>The eyes of the inner sanctum disciple of the unique demon Academy, who had been sitting on the armchair and looking listless, lit up slightly. A hint of greed appeared in his eyes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique let out a long hiss. The sword Qi on his body became more and more resplendent as he charged towards Kang Ji and the others.</p><p>He had indeed cultivated a secret skill, the sword body technique. Once he used it, the power of his sword technique could be increased by 50%.</p><p>At the critical moment, the power of the sword Art was increased by 50%, which was already extremely shocking.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Kang Ji’s heart was shocked. He didn’t dare to resist and retreated while shouting.</p><p>The others all charged at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He sent out a dozen sword lights, forcing back all the experts who were attacking him. Then, he stared at one of them and started to attack.</p><p>That person was shocked and frantically tried to block. However, he was only at the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm and couldn’t block the ancestor of technique. After blocking a few moves, he was severely injured.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique slashed down with his sword and directly split this person in half.</p><p>Another stage four true G.o.d expert was killed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After killing this person, the ancestor of technique’s aura became even stronger as he charged towards the others.</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, mo kan and the rest were extremely shocked. They didn’t dare to take it head on and retreated madly.</p><p>“Good, the general is mighty!”</p><p>When the righteous Army saw the ancestor of technique’s display of power, they were extremely excited.</p><p>“Kang Ji, hand over your life.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique stared at Kang Ji and charged towards him.</p><p>Among these people, the one that the ancestor of technique wanted to kill the most was Kang Ji. It was Kang Ji who treated the heaven realm and the primordial realm as his farm and used the elites of the heaven realm and the primordial realm to refine divine pills.</p><p>Moreover, most of the demiG.o.ds that walked out of the heaven realm were controlled by Kang Ji. As long as Kang Ji was killed, the restrictions placed on them would naturally be lifted.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Kang Ji was shocked. He frantically retreated, his face filled with fear.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>No one could stop the ancestor of technique as he quickly chased after Kang Ji. The distance between the two sides was getting closer and closer.</p><p>“Long ‘er, save me, save me …”</p><p>Kang Ji shouted towards Kang long.</p><p>“Father, senior brother, please save my father!”</p><p>Kang long was anxious as he looked at the young man.</p><p>“Don’t worry, your father won’t die.”</p><p>The young man in the brocade robe stood up and took a step forward. His body was like a bolt of lightning as he pounced toward the ancestor of technique.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Before it even reached him, the young man in the brocade robe struck out with his palm. A palm print as black as ink pressed down on the ancestor of technique. Its power was shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
