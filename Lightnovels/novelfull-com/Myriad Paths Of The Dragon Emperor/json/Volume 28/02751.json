Some of them even had tears in their eyes.</p><p>The ice jade cold heart was the most important treasure of the ice Soul Clan. It was of great significance to the ice Soul Clan. With the ice jade cold heart, the ice Soul Clan would be able to produce more Supreme talents and rise to power in the future.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan had the chance to surpa.s.s the Scarlet Flame clan and become the most powerful Overlord in the Qin heaven star system. Naturally, they were excited.</p><p>Bing Qing closed the jade box and kept it.</p><p>let’s go back to ice Soul Star as soon as possible. The clan leader and the Grand elders will be very happy to know about this.</p><p>An expert from the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>Everyone immediately set off and returned to ice Soul Star.</p><p>After some time, they returned to ice Soul Star.</p><p>When they returned to ice Soul Star, the planet was in a state of celebration.</p><p>This was because before they returned, the news of the icy jade heart had already been spread.</p><p>That night, the ice Soul Clan held a large banquet to celebrate the arrival of the ice jade cold heart from the ancestral land.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were all invited to this banquet.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan had personally attended the banquet.</p><p>A large hall was filled with people.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was sitting at the head of the table. Beside him were some of the ice Soul clan’s experts.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were sitting at the lower seats. He saw Bing Qing in the crowd.</p><p>“Father, it’s all thanks to brother Lu Ming from the Kong Xuan sect that we were able to obtain the ice jade cold heart this time. If it wasn’t for brother Lu, we definitely wouldn’t have been able to get it back.”</p><p>Not long after the banquet started, Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>yes, I have a rough idea of what happened this time. I didn’t expect that the Kong Xuan sect would have such a prodigy. This is truly worthy of celebration.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan smiled. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, the ice Soul Clan is greatly indebted to you for helping us retrieve the ice jade cold heart. If you need anything, just tell us. We’ll try our best to satisfy you.”</p><p>“Clan leader, I wonder if you can give me some Cold Moon Stones.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>Although he already had six Cold Moon Stones, the more Cold Moon Stones he had, the better it would be for him to cultivate the ice chain.</p><p>“Cold Moon Stone? How many do you need?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan asked.</p><p>“That … Just give me eight or ten Yuan and that’ll do!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“What? Eight or ten?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan and the other experts looked at each other before they smiled helplessly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll be honest with you. There aren’t many cold Moon Stones left in the ice Soul Clan. Even if we search the entire clan, we won’t be able to find more than ten.”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan laughed bitterly.</p><p>“So little?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>The entire ice Soul Clan couldn’t take out eight to ten pieces. He had made a fortune by getting six pieces this time.</p><p>“How about this? as the clan leader, I’ll take two Cold Moon Stones from the ice Soul clan’s Treasury and give them to you.”</p><p>The patriarch of the ice Soul Clan said. He waved his hand and ordered someone to get the Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>“Thank you, chief.”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his thanks.</p><p>The Cold Moon Stone was so rare that it was already good enough to get two more.</p><p>In addition to the six from before, there were a total of eight pieces. The remaining eight chains of the ice chain were each a piece.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the person to bring the Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan took out the Cold Moon Stone. Immediately, two stones that looked like bright moons appeared. They were exactly the same as the one Lu Ming had.</p><p>“Lu Ming, these two Cold Moon Stones are for you.”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan waved his hand and two Cold Moon Stones flew toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming quickly took them and put them away.</p><p>“Also, take this gold and Jade token.”</p><p>Then, the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan took out a golden token. He waved his hand and it flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it. It was cold to the touch, and a chill emanated from it.</p><p>this Golden Jade token represents the highest rank of the ice Soul clan’s guest. In the future, you can use this Golden Jade to ask for help from the ice Soul Clan when you’re in a place that only has our ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“Thank you, chief.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he kept it.</p><p>This Golden Jade token could be used to seek help from the ice Soul Clan. It was extremely valuable and could be of great use at a critical moment.</p><p>Many people looked at him with envy.</p><p>The banquet ended and the crowd dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stayed on ice Soul Star for another three days. Three days later, they bade farewell and returned to Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>They took the teleportation formation and headed toward the Kong Xuan sect. After some traveling, they returned to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After returning to Kong Xuan sect, they rushed to the mission Palace Hall to submit their mission and Exchange it for rewards.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for your help this time.”</p><p>On the way, the long-faced young man suddenly stopped and cupped his fists at Lu Ming to express his grat.i.tude.</p><p>“As the team leader this time, it’s my responsibility to keep you guys alive. You don’t have to thank me.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>no, without you this time, I would have been dead for sure, not to mention completing the mission and exchanging for points. You saved my life, and I, Liu Chang, am a person who knows how to repay kindness. From now on, if you have any orders, I will not refuse.</p><p>Liu Chang bowed and cupped his fists once more.</p><p>This time, he was really convinced by Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, when he first met Lu Ming and found out that Lu Ming was their team leader, he was very unconvinced and wanted to challenge Lu Ming to get lost.</p><p>However, the talent and combat power that Lu Ming had displayed throughout the journey was simply a miracle. He was deeply convinced.</p><p>He planned to follow Lu Ming in the future.</p><p>“Liu Chang, now you know how powerful my boss is. If you follow my boss, you’ll get benefits in the future.”</p><p>An hai grinned.</p><p>“I, Zhao Feng, am willing to follow boss Lu Ming in the future. I will not reject you.”</p><p>The other young man was even more direct. He simply called Lu Ming ‘boss’.</p><p>“You guys want to follow me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he asked.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Liu Chang, Zhao Feng, and an hai all nodded.</p><p>you didn’t join any other Saint factions before? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“No, I’m not from any faction.”</p><p>“I don’t have any either!”</p><p>Zhao Feng and an hai both shook their heads.</p><p>“I used to be from the floating light Faction, but I’m willing to leave the floating light Faction and follow you, boss.”</p><p>Liu Chang finally said.</p><p>After this incident, Liu Chang had a feeling that Lu Ming’s talent was far above those Holy Sons. He might be able to defeat all the other Holy Sons and holy virgins in the future and dominate the entire Kong Xuan sect. He naturally had to join such a genius as soon as possible.</p><p>“Alright, then you all can follow me. However, you must swear on your life force origin that you are truly loyal to me. Otherwise, I will not accept you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He did need some help in the Kong Xuan sect. That way, it would be more convenient for him to do certain things.</p><p>For example, information gathering.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
