It’s not good for me to fight him head-on.”</p><p>Le muttered.</p><p>He was really frightened.</p><p>His cultivation was already at the peak of the ninth stage of the true G.o.d Realm and the divine power he controlled was also King grade divine power. His fighting power was much stronger than the bull-horned young man and the other man. However, just now, he didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>He could not gauge Lu Ming’s actual combat strength and was afraid that Lu Ming had not used his full strength just now. If Lu Ming had not used his full strength just now, he would not be confident if he went out rashly.</p><p>I’d better hide in the dark and wait for an opportunity to strike. It seems that Lu Ming came to the ancient G.o.ds star to look for the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. If the ancient G.o.ds Mountain appears, I’ll be able to obtain some opportunities.</p><p>He pondered and made a decision. He decided to hide in the dark and wait for an opportunity to kill in one strike.</p><p>Lu Ming continued on his way to the fu residence.</p><p>The fu clan was located in the middle of a mountain range. Even from a distance, one could see the luxurious palaces built on the divine peaks.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to fly forward when suddenly, figures flickered from all directions. At the same time, sharp attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and cast the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor. A Crimson Gold armor enveloped him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>All the attacks landed on the Golden armor and were blocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, the group of people surrounded Lu Ming. They had ferocious expressions on their faces as they stared at Lu Ming cautiously and fearfully.</p><p>“Who are you? Why do you want to exterminate my Fu clan?”</p><p>A burly man roared.</p><p>“？？？”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He was roaring in his heart. When did I want to destroy you?</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not say anything, another old man shouted, ” “Don’t waste your breath on him. If he wants to kill us, then we’ll kill him. Let’s kill him together.”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The group of people roared. There were at least a few hundred of them, and they launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Among this group of people, the one with the highest cultivation was at the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm. There were even many of them who were at the virtual G.o.d Realm. Although there were many of them, they were not a threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have the habit of standing still and not retaliating.</p><p>A long spear appeared in his hand. He swept the long spear horizontally, and a huge spear light crushed toward the crowd.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>This group of people, regardless of whether they were fourth-stage true G.o.d-level or virtual G.o.d-level, were like sandbags. They were sent flying by Lu Ming and fell all over the ground.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Someone shouted. They were filled with despair and stared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>hey, I have no enmity with you. It’s fine if you attack me for no reason, but you’re also looking at me as if you have a deep hatred for me. What do you mean? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>“No grudges? Are you not here to exterminate my Fu clan?”</p><p>An old man called out.</p><p>“Exterminate your Fu clan?”</p><p>“If I wanted to exterminate the fu family, would you still be alive?” Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>Everyone on the other side was stunned, and then they looked at each other.</p><p>That was indeed the case. With Lu Ming’s abilities, it would be as easy as turning his hand if he wanted to kill them. Just now, he had sent all of them flying with one shot, but he did not kill a single one. If he wanted to kill them, why would he do that?</p><p>“Then … Then you … And you are?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming uneasily and stuttered.</p><p>They were afraid that Lu Ming would kill them if they angered him.</p><p>“I heard that five families have been exterminated in the vicinity. I was curious and wanted to come to your Fu clan to take a look. I didn’t expect to be regarded as an enemy by you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not find it strange.</p><p>The other party was facing the danger of being annihilated at any moment, so it was normal to be a little frightened.</p><p>young hero, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. We were too impetuous just now …</p><p>That stage four true G.o.d old man apologized repeatedly.</p><p>“It’s fine …”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands. His expression suddenly changed as he looked in a direction.”It seems like the person who wants to exterminate you all has really come.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The fu clan elder’s expression changed drastically as he quickly looked in that direction.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In that direction, there were many black shadows flashing towards them at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Within a few breaths, the black shadows had arrived and surrounded the fu clan and Lu Ming. There were more than two hundred of them.</p><p>These people were all wrapped in black robes, giving off a mysterious and dangerous feeling.</p><p>“Who are you people? What are you guys trying to do?”</p><p>The fu clan elder asked in shock.</p><p>hand over the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain and I will spare your lives!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said in a hoa.r.s.e voice.</p><p>what map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain? our Fu clan doesn’t have a map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>The fu clan elder roared.</p><p>“No? Hehe, you won’t shed tears until you see the coffin. Then let’s exterminate the fu clan and we’ll find them ourselves. Kill!”</p><p>The leader of the black-robed men waved his hand, and more than two hundred black-robed men moved. Their figures flickered, and they charged toward the fu clan’s people with extreme speed.</p><p>“They’re all experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and realized that these black-robed men were all experts. Most of them were true G.o.d Realm experts. The strongest few had reached the fifth stage of true G.o.d Realm, and their abilities were far above the fu family.</p><p>“Defend, defend!”</p><p>The fu clan elder roared and gathered the fu clan members into a defensive formation.</p><p>Although the fu clan had more people, their strength was far inferior to the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take action immediately. He planned to make the fu family suffer a little before he took action.</p><p>However, even though he didn’t want to do it, someone forced him to.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A third stage true G.o.d Realm black-robed man charged at Lu Ming. The cold blade light was aimed at Lu Ming’s head, wanting to split him in half.</p><p>“I originally wanted to let you live a little longer, but you’re really looking for death.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He thrust his spear forward and killed the man.</p><p>When the other black-robed men saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. His figure flashed and his long spear trembled. Rays of spear radiance burst out.</p><p>Among these people, the highest was only at the fifth stage true G.o.d Realm. Moreover, the divine power they controlled was almost all ordinary divine power. In Lu Ming’s hands, they could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Each spear light would take a person’s life.</p><p>Over a hundred spear lights burst out and over a hundred Men in Black were all killed. Their corpses lay all over the ground.</p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Both the Men in Black and the fu clan were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After a few seconds, the Man in Black finally reacted and started to escape in all directions.</p><p>They understood that they had encountered a terrifying expert. If they stayed, they would all die.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming growled. Eight ice chains flew out and grew rapidly. The sky was filled with the shadows of the chains, binding the hundreds of men in Black.</p><p>How could these black-robed men avoid the attack of the ice chains? they were all bound by the terrifying coldness of the ice chains and froze there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
