In this world, there is only the winner takes all, how can you call it despicable?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered and didn’t take it seriously.</p><p>“That’s right, Tian Hong’s meaning is also my meaning!”</p><p>At that moment, another voice was heard. The sacred son of reflection had also walked over. His voice reverberated throughout the area.”I, floating light, also declare that whoever joins Lu Ming’s faction will be my enemy!”</p><p>The two Saints ‘words silenced the crowd.</p><p>Initially, there were some neutral people who did not join any factions. However, after seeing Lu Ming’s amazing talent, they were already tempted to join him.</p><p>However, at this moment, they were all hesitating.</p><p>If they joined Lu Ming’s sect, they would have to face the retaliation of the sacred son of reflection and the Tianhong sacred son. Could they bear the risk?</p><p>Many people secretly shook their heads and gave up on the idea of joining Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base was still too weak. Although he was invincible among true G.o.ds, true G.o.ds could not be compared to celestial G.o.ds.</p><p>True G.o.ds were unrivaled. Even heavenly G.o.ds were no match for them, let alone top geniuses like the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection.</p><p>“I, zhixia, also have the same intention!”</p><p>“I, Xue Tan, am the same!”</p><p>Then, the Zhi Xia Saint son and the Xue Tan Saint daughter stepped forward one after another, expressing the same thoughts as the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too strong and it made them feel great pressure.</p><p>He must not let Lu Ming grow. The best way was to suppress him before he grew up.</p><p>Without the support of the others, no matter how strong Lu Ming’s cultivation was, it would be difficult for him to become the sect leader of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After four consecutive statements from the Holy Sons and holy virgins, those who wanted to join Lu Ming’s faction had completely given up on the idea.</p><p>“These fellows …”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>Although he did not care about the position of the Saint and did not want to be the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect in the future, he was still a Saint.</p><p>However, it was not Lu Ming’s style to not resist when he was being bullied.</p><p>now, if there’s anyone who wants to join my faction, I, Lu Ming, swear that I’ll treat you with sincerity and entrust you with important tasks. If you want to join my faction, you can come and sign up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard by everyone.</p><p>Many people were tempted.</p><p>If they joined Lu Ming now, they would definitely be put in an important position and be entrusted with important tasks. Moreover, if Lu Ming were to develop further, the people who joined now would definitely be his trusted aides.</p><p>However, if they joined now, they would be going against the Tian Hong Saint son and the others. They would be courting death.</p><p>In the end, many people shook their heads and dispelled the idea.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll join your faction!”</p><p>Yue Linglong walked out and glared at the Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others ‘faces darkened. However, they knew that Yue Linglong’s background was extraordinary, so they naturally wouldn’t say anything.</p><p>“I’ll join too!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng also ran over to join in the fun.</p><p>However, other than the two of them, no one else stepped forward.</p><p>“Hehe …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was about to sneer and mock him, but he was interrupted.</p><p>“I’ll join …”</p><p>A deep voice was heard. An hai walked out of the crowd and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s sneer was stuck in his throat. His face was extremely ugly as he looked at an hai with a cold gaze.</p><p>An Hai’s expression changed when he was met with the Tian Hong Saint son’s gaze. He felt immense pressure, but he gritted his teeth and went to Lu Ming. “Boss, I want to join your faction!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He quite agreed with the big guy an hai.</p><p>who is this kid? he has the guts to join Lu Ming’s faction. Does he want to die? ”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, the Zhi Xia Saint son, and the Xue Tan saintess had just said that joining Lu Ming’s faction would be going against them. They had just finished their words when an hai jumped out and joined Lu Ming. This was like a slap to their faces in public.</p><p>If this wasn’t seeking death, what was?</p><p>“Liu Chang, Zhao Feng, what are you two doing? Hurry up and join the boss’s faction!”</p><p>&Nbsp; an hai looked at Liu Chang and Zhao Feng.</p><p>Liu Chang’s and Zhao Feng’s faces were white as snow, and their eyes were filled with struggle and hesitation. In the end, the two of them gritted their teeth and walked out, saying, we’re willing to join Lu Ming’s faction. Holy Son Lu Ming, please fulfill our wish!</p><p>Back then, they had all sworn on their life source to pledge their allegiance to Lu Ming. Now, they could only bite the bullet and do it.</p><p>“Alright, I agree to let you join!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The expressions of the Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others turned even colder. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they kept glancing at an hai and the others, causing them to break out in cold sweat.</p><p>“Good, good, you three, very good!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son glanced at an hai and the other two and said ” okay ” several times. Then, he waved his sleeves and turned to leave.</p><p>The floating light Saint son, Zhi Xia Saint son, and Xue Tan Saint daughter didn’t say anything. They all turned and left.</p><p>In the end, apart from an hai, Liu Chang, Zhao Feng, and a few others, no one else joined Lu Ming’s faction.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry.</p><p>No one was joining now, but that didn’t mean that there wouldn’t be in the future. It was still uncertain who would have the last laugh.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stay. He turned and left, followed by an hai and the rest.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect compet.i.tion had just ended. Lu Ming’s name had shaken the Kong Xuan sect from then on, and even spread to other sects.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming gave an hai, Liu Chang, Zhao Feng, and the others some resources and told them to cultivate properly when they returned.</p><p>Lu Ming would not mistreat anyone who had joined him under the pressure of the Tian Hong Saint son and the others.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to his residence alone and cultivated in peace.</p><p>“Could it be that this little fellow is about to evolve?”</p><p>He had only been back for two days when QiuQiu started to change. It flew out of Lu Ming’s wrist and landed in the courtyard, turning into a metal ball. Lu Ming could feel a terrifying aura lurking inside, as if it was going to explode at any time.</p><p>滋滋…</p><p>On QiuQiu’s surface, arcs of lightning appeared.</p><p>Ever since QiuQiu bit off a piece of bronze from the bronze gate a few years ago on the ancient G.o.d Star, it had been in a deep sleep. It seemed to be digesting that piece of bronze, and it was only now that there were changes.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it.</p><p>The bronze door that had appeared on the ancient G.o.d Star must have had an astonishing origin. Even many divine kings could not break it open, so it was obvious.</p><p>Lu Ming could not tell what kind of changes QiuQiu would undergo after it digested the bronze.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze flickered and he walked out of the courtyard’s entrance.</p><p>A figure landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was an old man with white hair and a white beard.</p><p>“Greetings, elder!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists. He could tell that the old man was an inner sect elder from his attire.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming, you’re too kind!”</p><p>The old man didn’t dare to be slow and quickly returned the greeting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
