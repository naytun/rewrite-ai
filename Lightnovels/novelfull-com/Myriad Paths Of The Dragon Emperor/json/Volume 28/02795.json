This token was very similar to their disciple’s token, but the material was completely different.</p><p>The token was made of the extremely rare star sky Gold.</p><p>Stardust Sky Gold was a precious material that could be used to refine Supreme-grade divine artifacts.</p><p>What was a Supreme-grade divine weapon? it was a divine weapon used by divine kings.</p><p>From this, one could see how precious this token was.</p><p>Saint, you just need to drip a drop of blood on it and this token will be bound to you.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming understands. Thank you, elder!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The old man nodded secretly. He was quite satisfied with Lu Ming’s att.i.tude.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins were all extremely arrogant. When they saw their inner sect elders, they would also act high and mighty. Lu Ming’s humble att.i.tude had left a good impression on him.</p><p>it’s a pity that his cultivation is still too low. I don’t know if he’ll have a bright future if he’s competing with the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection. I can consider joining his faction when his cultivation is higher!</p><p>The old man thought to himself.</p><p>Holy Son Lu Ming, there’s one more thing. You can choose any divine grade technique you want to cultivate in the Scriptures Depository. However, you’ve already mastered the divine grade divine power, so you won’t be able to use the divine grade technique.</p><p>The old man reminded him again before taking his leave.</p><p>He did not know that Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The Son of G.o.d could freely choose a divine grade technique to cultivate. It would be strange if Lu Ming did not like it. This meant that he could cultivate another divine grade divine power.</p><p>For other people who had cultivated divine grade divine power, the other divine grade techniques were naturally of little use. However, Lu Ming was different. He had the universe thousand Dao scroll. The more divine techniques he had, the better.</p><p>“Don’t be a fool …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the courtyard. He realized that QiuQiu was still evolving. Lu Ming left the courtyard immediately and went to the Scripture chamber.</p><p>The Scripture chamber was still guarded by the old men.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re here again. What kind of divine skill or secret skill do you want to exchange this time?”</p><p>One of the old men asked with a smile.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had exchanged for several King-grade divine skills and techniques. He had also exchanged for the secret technique, the frost technique. He had even spent 50000 points to exchange for the first stage of the ultimate frost divine technique. Therefore, the elders had a deep impression of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seniors, I’ve come to receive a Divine Art this time.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What? To receive the divine grade technique?”</p><p>The elders ‘eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“Little fellow, you can’t joke about this. It’s not that easy to obtain a Saint-grade Divine Art.”</p><p>One of the old men stopped smiling and said.</p><p>In order to receive the complete divine grade technique, one had to either be promoted to a Holy Son, or be extremely talented, and be recognized by the higher-ups of the sect. Only then could one receive the complete divine grade technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the third stage of true G.o.d Realm. It was impossible for him to be a Holy Son. They had ruled out this point.</p><p>Could it be that he had been appreciated by the higher-ups of the sect and had come here to receive a Saint-grade Divine Art?</p><p>The few elders thought so.</p><p>yes, I’ve just been promoted to the Saint. This is my Saint token …</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Saint token and handed it to the elders.</p><p>“Oh, I see. What? Saint … The Saint?”</p><p>The few old men didn’t react in the beginning, but when they finally reacted, they almost jumped out of their seats.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually a Saint who had just been promoted?</p><p>Third stage true G.o.d actually became a Holy Son. This greatly exceeded their expectations.</p><p>An elder took the Holy Son token from Lu Ming’s hand in bewilderment. After checking it, he realized that there was no mistake.</p><p>“This … Little fellow, you’re really a weirdo!”</p><p>In the end, the few elders came to a conclusion.</p><p>“Since you’re the Saint, you’ll naturally be able to obtain a complete set of divine grade techniques. Which one do you want? I remember that you exchanged for the first stage of the ultimate cold divine technique. You want the ultimate cold divine technique, right?”</p><p>An old man took a deep breath to calm himself down and smiled.</p><p>From his point of view, since Lu Ming had already exchanged for the first stage of the ultimate cold divine technique, he would definitely exchange for the complete ultimate cold divine technique this time. Otherwise, wouldn’t the 50000 points he had spent previously be in vain?</p><p>He speculated that Lu Ming was most likely confident that he would become a saint and obtain the complete divine Art. That was why he had exchanged for the first level in advance and cultivated it for a while.</p><p>“Senior, I want the ‘great profound divine technique’,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>There were a few divine skills and techniques in the kongxuan sect, and the taixuan divine technique was one of them.</p><p>“What? You want the great profound divine technique?”</p><p>The elders were stunned again.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had clearly exchanged for the first stage of the ultimate frost divine technique. Why did he want to exchange for the mysterious divine technique now?</p><p>“Little guy, I remember that you exchanged for the first stage of the ultimate cold divine technique. How did you exchange for the mysterious divine technique now? You have to consider it carefully.”</p><p>An old man kindly reminded.</p><p>“Senior, I’ve already considered it.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright then, wait a moment, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>An old man said as he stepped into the Scripture chamber.</p><p>Not long after, the elder took out a scroll and pa.s.sed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little guy, the complete great profound divine technique is recorded inside. Take it, but I have to remind you that without the approval of the sect, you must not teach it to others. Do you understand?”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“This junior understands. Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and took the scroll. His heart was burning with pa.s.sion. He immediately bade farewell to the few elders and returned to his residence.</p><p>I’m getting old. I really can’t understand the young people nowadays.</p><p>The few elders sighed repeatedly. They could not see through Lu Ming at all. In their eyes, a young man seemed to be a little unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his residence. QiuQiu was still evolving.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on the ground and took out the great mystery divine technique to read it in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming did not need the complete tai Xuan divine technique. He only needed the first stage. As long as he cultivated the first stage, he would be able to condense a flame of tai Xuan divine power.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed.</p><p>For the past month, Lu Ming had been focused on cultivating the great profound divine technique. He had finally cultivated to the first stage and successfully cultivated a wisp of great profound divine power.</p><p>After cultivating a wisp of the mysterious divine energy, Lu Ming switched to the universe thousand Dao mantra. As time pa.s.sed, the wisp of mysterious divine energy continued to grow.</p><p>A few months pa.s.sed by in a hurry.</p><p>A light spot suddenly appeared in Lu Ming’s dantian. All the mysterious divine energy gathered towards this light spot. The light spot became more and more dazzling.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
