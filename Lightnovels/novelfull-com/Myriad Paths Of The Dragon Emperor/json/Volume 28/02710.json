It exploded with a shocking aura that pressed towards Lu Ming and the other two like a tide.</p><p>“Third stage true G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng’s expressions changed.</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing’s cultivation wasn’t at the first stage of true G.o.d Realm, but the third stage of true G.o.d Realm. Clearly, during these years in the dark Dragon secret realm, even if he was trapped by the formation here, his cultivation still broke through and reached the third stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><p>The empty star made his move. With a wave of his hand, the sky was filled with his palm prints, which enveloped Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted and immediately attacked. Facing the star of sky, she didn’t dare to be careless. She used all her strength as soon as she attacked.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng made their moves as well. All sorts of attacks collided with the palm print of the star in the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Violent rumbles came from the cave as all kinds of attacks exploded. The palm prints of the stars in the sky were destroyed one after another.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the few of them had exchanged dozens of moves. Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng were forced to retreat. The star of the sky was indeed worthy of being the No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list a hundred thousand years ago. Its combat strength was shockingly powerful and was not something that ordinary heaven’s favorites could compare to.</p><p>If he wasn’t trapped by the formation here, his cultivation wouldn’t be at the third stage of true G.o.d Realm. He would have reached a shocking realm long ago.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s group of three were also very powerful. When Sky Star fought with the three of them, he was also forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>“You have some strength!”</p><p>Kong Zhi’s eyes were filled with shock. He did not expect that Lu Ming and the other two could block his attack.</p><p>A hundred thousand years ago, in the outer sect area of Kong Xuan sect, he was unrivaled even if they were at the same level. Now, his cultivation was far above Lu Ming and the other two, but he was not able to suppress them in one go. This was beyond his expectations.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block. Get over here!” Kong Zhi Xing snorted and stepped forward. He reached out his palm and palm prints appeared again, blasting towards the three of them. The power of each move was stronger than before, giving people a strong pressure.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s faces became very serious as they circulated their divine power to the extreme.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was constantly triggering the battle formula!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a series of attempts, Lu Ming finally triggered the tripled combat power.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-piercing, and in an instant, spearlights appeared in the void like meteors, colliding with the palm print of the star in the sky.</p><p>A loud boom was heard in the cave again.</p><p>It had to be said that the star in the sky was indeed very powerful. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him and he retreated quickly. The qi and blood in his body churned and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>He didn’t know that the empty star was even more shocked.</p><p>Although he did not use his full strength just now, he was a third tier true G.o.d. His attack was almost blocked by Lu Ming alone. Lu Ming was only at seventh tier void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>I didn’t expect such a powerful genius to appear in the Kong Xuan sect after I was trapped for 100000 years. However, your days are over today!</p><p>Kong Zhi’s eyes were filled with killing intent and deep jealousy.</p><p>Yes, it was jealousy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength and talent were obviously far above his. He wanted to kill him completely.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>He moved his body and was about to pounce on Lu Ming. Lu Ming and the other two gathered together, planning to fight with all their might.</p><p>However, just as the empty star was about to approach them, runes suddenly appeared on the ground. These runes glowed with a resplendent light and filled the air with energy. It was extremely strange.</p><p>At the same time, runes appeared on the empty star, exactly the same as the runes on the ground.</p><p>These runes were like tentacles that tightly wrapped around the body of the empty star.</p><p>The figure of the sky Star that had pounced forward came to an abrupt stop, forcibly stopping in the air, unable to pounce forward in the slightest.</p><p>he’s been trapped by the formation. It’s hard for him to leave the formation’s range!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he said to Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>break! the empty star roared and exploded with all his strength. He wanted to break through the formation but it was useless. He couldn’t break through the formation at all.</p><p>“It seems that you won’t be able to come out!” Lu Ming sneered and had a mocking look on his face.</p><p>“The few of you, hurry up and get over here. Help me break this d.a.m.ned formation. Otherwise, when I get out, I’ll definitely tear you into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>The empty star saw that he couldn’t get out, so he started to roar and threaten them.</p><p>“You still want to come out? Now, you’re like a fish on the chopping board, a live target. You’re not begging us, but threatening us. You’re really courting death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>I’ve heard that Kong Zhi Xing is a narrow-minded person who will take revenge. A hundred thousand years ago, he wasn’t the first on the void G.o.d rank in the Kong Xuan sect. It was someone else. He killed that person and became first. If we don’t kill him today, he’ll definitely take revenge on us when he comes out! Yue Linglong said coldly.</p><p>“Then get rid of him!” Wu Zifeng also said.</p><p>For someone like Kong Xing, since he had offended him, he had to get rid of him. Otherwise, there would be endless trouble.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming made his move immediately. He stood in the distance and shot out a spear Ray at the sky Star.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also made their moves. They used their killing moves to attack the star of sky.</p><p>The empty star blocked the attacks from Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“You want to kill me with just you guys? dream on!”</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing shouted coldly. His eyes were extremely ferocious and evil, as if he could not wait to cut Lu Ming and the rest into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two kept on attacking but they were all blocked by the stars in the sky.</p><p>Their cultivations were not as high as the empty star, and they were attacking from a distance, so their attack power was naturally reduced.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. In this case, it was indeed difficult for them to kill with the star of the sky.</p><p>If he couldn’t kill the star of s.p.a.ce, he wouldn’t be able to get the dark Dragon blood jade and the rainbow G.o.dstone.</p><p>“There are a few death relics in this formation. Once you attack them, the formation’s power will increase exponentially. Lu Ming, attack the death relics …“</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the battle symbol art was heard. He had finally found some of the array’s eyes and immediately guided Lu Ming on how to attack.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He changed the momentum of his spear and the Spear’s gleam changed its direction. It did not attack the empty star but instead, it attacked an empty spot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When Lu Ming’s spearlight hit the empty s.p.a.ce, the runes of the formation suddenly shone brightly and its power increased greatly. At the same time, the runes that were wrapped around the empty star’s body also increased in power.</p><p>They were like steel cables, tightly tightening and trying to break the empty star’s body into several pieces.</p><p>“Ah, what happened? d.a.m.n it, what have you done?”</p><p>The empty star suddenly screamed in fear. Then, his body trembled and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He launched another attack at the death eye of the formation, making the formation even more powerful.</p><p>The empty star couldn’t take it anymore. Cracks appeared on its body, and it spat out a large mouthful of blood. It was heavily injured.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
