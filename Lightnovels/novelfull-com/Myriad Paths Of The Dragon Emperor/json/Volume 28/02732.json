Let’s split up into a dozen groups. This way, at least a portion of us won’t be chased by the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>also, if the frost Jade ice phoenixes split up and chase us, it will be easier for us to escape. At least we won’t be surrounded.</p><p>then, what if the nine frost Jade ice phoenixes didn’t split up, but instead joined together to pursue a group of people? ”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Then it can only be said that that group of people is unlucky.”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>Some people’s faces paled and looked a little unsightly.</p><p>If they split up and escaped, the nine frost Jade ice phoenixes would focus on the same group of people and only death would await them.</p><p>“I agree. Let’s split up.”</p><p>Liu shangkai was the first to speak.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming also spoke.</p><p>The team leaders of two sects had agreed, and bingqing’s side had obviously agreed as well. The other sects could only agree.</p><p>“Alright, how do we split it? We’ll decide on our own. When we get separated, we’ll meet at the center of the map.”</p><p>Bing Qing ordered. More than 50 ice Soul clan’s geniuses were divided into 12 teams and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also spread out.</p><p>Each of the sects split into teams and randomly chose a direction to fly in.</p><p>The ten people from the Kong Xuan sect gathered together.</p><p>In this way, there were 12 teams from the ice Soul Clan and 18 teams in total, including the six sects.</p><p>And there were only nine frost Jade ice phoenixes, so it was naturally impossible for them to chase after eighteen teams at the same time.</p><p>The nine frost Jade ice phoenixes cried out a few times and split up into nine different directions, chasing after nine of the teams.</p><p>hahaha, they didn’t chase us. That’s great!</p><p>“We’re lucky, run!”</p><p>Nine of the teams were not pursued by the frost Jade Ice Phoenix, and they were immediately overjoyed. They increased their speed and fled forward.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, they’re chasing us.”</p><p>“How unlucky.”</p><p>The teams that were being chased all had ugly expressions on their faces, but fortunately, there was only one chasing them, so there was still hope of escape.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others were also being chased by a frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>“What bad luck.”</p><p>The long-faced young man cursed as he used all his divine power to fly.</p><p>They were very clear about the frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s strength. It was too powerful. Even the team leader of the unique demon Academy, Liu shangkai, was not its match. They were most likely no match for it either. They could only try their best to shake off the other party or hope that the other party would not pursue them relentlessly.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, had been running for a full two hours. They had no idea how far they had run, but the frost Jade Ice Phoenix was still chasing them.</p><p>Furthermore, because they had been flying for a long time, they had used up a lot of their divine power, while the frost Jade Ice Phoenix seemed to have an endless supply of energy. The distance between them was slowly closing.</p><p>If this continued, it was only a matter of time before he was caught.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>“If I really can’t, I’ll fight it to the death.”</p><p>A few Kong Xuan sect disciples roared in anger. It was impossible for anyone else to come to their rescue. At this moment, they had long since separated from the other sects.</p><p>“You guys go first, I’ll block him.”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>What?</p><p>The others were all stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to stay behind and fend off the frost Jade Ice Phoenix alone?</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, he was definitely not a match for the frost Jade Ice Phoenix. Previously, Liu shangkai’s strength was shocking enough, but he was still at a disadvantage. Lu Ming was most likely no match for it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s flying figure suddenly stopped.</p><p>When the other members of Kong Xuan sect saw this, they gritted their teeth and continued flying forward.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The cold Jade Ice Phoenix screeched. It glared at Lu Ming with its sharp and cold eyes as it approached him quickly.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A powerful fighting spirit emanated from his body. The battle character art tripled his combat power and exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop because he was willing to sacrifice himself for others. The reason he stopped was that an hai was a good person, and Lu Ming did not want him to die at the hands of the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had stayed because he was confident that he could escape.</p><p>If Lu Ming was not confident that he could escape, he would not stay.</p><p>“Let me see how strong you are.”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and activated the nine-stage Crimson Gold armor. A Crimson Gold armor appeared.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming used his strongest move, becoming one with the spear, and turned into a dazzling spear ray, stabbing at the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The cold Jade Ice Phoenix cried out. Its body was covered in a thick layer of Ice Armor. Under the boost of its terrifying speed, it was like a sharp sword that pierced through the void.</p><p>A sword light and a spear light collided with each other at an extremely high speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; with a terrifying boom, the two forces collided, creating shockwaves that spread in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force rushing towards him. His body trembled violently as he was pushed back by this force. He only stopped after flying a few hundred miles.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt the blood in his body churning and a trace of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage in the clash just now. The frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s strength was beyond Lu Ming’s imagination. If he had not activated the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor in advance, his injuries would have been even more severe.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also controlled the ultimate cold divine power, so the ultimate cold Qi of the ice Phoenix was ineffective against him. Otherwise, if it were someone else, they would have been more seriously injured.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix let out a cry and continued to charge towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the frost Jade Ice Phoenix once again, unleashing his divine power to the maximum.</p><p>Although the frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s strength was strong, it still couldn’t kill him in an instant. It could only cause him some light injuries. This way, it could be used to hone his divine skills.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique!</p><p>In the process of charging out, Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. His entire person seemed to have transformed into a kun Peng, soaring up ninety thousand miles.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the frost Jade Ice Phoenix collided once again.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was forced back as usual. Blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. His injuries were more serious but it was not a big deal.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a healing divine pill that he had bought long ago and swallowed it. Once again, he unleashed all his divine power and cast three divine skills at the same time, attacking the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>The amount of divine power consumed by casting three divine skills at the same time was shocking. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the divine power in his body was depleted after a few attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ‘quant.i.ty formula’.</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula stored a large amount of divine energy. At this moment, the divine energy gushed out continuously. The divine energy in Lu Ming’s body was replenished.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the frost Jade Ice Phoenix collided more than a dozen times in a row. Lu Ming was forced to retreat backward each time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>Although Lu Ming was injured at the moment, he was very happy. It was because of such an intense battle that his few G.o.dly skills were improving rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
