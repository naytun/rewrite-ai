He reached out and took the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>boy, give me the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>“Hurry up and hand it over.”</p><p>The three domain Lords, Youfeng, Xiangshan, and Yuhan, roared and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming shifted his body and moved a few hundred miles away, avoiding the attack.</p><p>I want this map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming said and put away the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Everyone around them was stunned. They then looked at Lu Ming as if he was an idiot.</p><p>Did he want the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain?</p><p>Do you think the three region Lords are just for show?</p><p>Wasn’t this courting death?</p><p>Even the three domain Lords were stunned for a moment, and then they all released cold killing intent.</p><p>“Kid, I’ve seen stupid people, but I’ve never seen someone as stupid as you. Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p><p>die! region master Youfeng shouted coldly. He pounced at Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>“He’s mine.”</p><p>“Don’t even think about s.n.a.t.c.hing it from me!”</p><p>The domain Lords of the elephant Mountain domain and the Yuhan domain pounced on Lu Ming, trying to kill him and take his storage ring.</p><p>“You really think I’m a soft persimmon.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and a long spear appeared in his hand. At the same time, Lu Ming activated the tripled combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted. The divine energy in his body circulated at full force and he cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-piercing.</p><p>The three spear lights carried a terrifying power as they pierced towards the domain lord Youfeng, the domain lord Xiangshan, and the domain lord Yuhan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After three consecutive explosions, the expressions of region master Youfeng and the other two changed drastically. Their bodies trembled and they couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure swayed and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At the scene, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had blocked the attacks of the three zone leaders and even forced them to retreat.</p><p>How could Lu Ming have such strong combat abilities?</p><p>Previously, some people felt that Lu Ming was foolish. Now, they realized that they were the foolish ones.</p><p>“Amazing, so amazing …”</p><p>The head of the fu family and the others were also shocked.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, this brat …”</p><p>Region master Youfeng and the other two couldn’t hide the shock in their eyes.</p><p>this kid is tricky. Why don’t the three of us work together and get rid of him first? then we can get the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Region master wandering wind transmitted a message to the other two region Masters.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>Domain lord Xiang Shan and domain lord Yu Han nodded their heads, agreeing to join forces.</p><p>From the fight just now, they knew that they were not Lu Ming’s match if they were alone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Zone master Youfeng and the other two moved. They charged at Lu Ming like a pair of horns.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The long spear vibrated and swept out.</p><p>The divine power that zone master Youfeng and the other two controlled was just ordinary divine power. Although they had the cultivation of eighth tier true G.o.d, Lu Ming was not afraid at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The thick spear light was like a mountain, bombarding the three territory Lords.</p><p>The three domain Lords all used their ultimate moves and the two sides fought intensely.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky continued to explode, and in the blink of an eye, both sides had exchanged hundreds of blows.</p><p>“Nice, I’ll try out my new move. Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed. The divine power in his body surged wildly and surged into the long spear.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the ice chains. A few chains swept toward the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region and the domain lord of the Yuhan region. Lu Ming himself cast the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting.</p><p>When the three apocalyptic strikes reached the fourth level, he could already use the second move, moon cutting.</p><p>The power of this move was even stronger than ‘s.p.a.ce-piercing’. Of course, the amount of divine power it consumed was even more shocking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ‘measure’ formula. He did not care about the consumption of divine power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear light, like a crescent moon, attacked protectorate Lord Youfeng.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Protectorate master Youfeng’s pupils contracted rapidly. He could sense how terrifying Lu Ming’s move was. He roared and exploded with all his strength, trying to block this move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Two strange sounds were heard. Then, Lu Ming’s figure dashed past while zone master Youfeng’s body stiffened in the air. His face was filled with horror.</p><p>Then, his body was torn apart, and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>At the sight of this scene, the domain Lords of the elephant Mountain region and the Yuhan region felt a chill run from their feet to their heads. They were almost scared to death. They retreated frantically to keep a distance from Lu Ming.</p><p>“The zone leader is dead, the zone leader is dead!”</p><p>Zone leader Youfeng’s subordinates were immediately thrown into chaos. They also retreated frantically, distancing themselves from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Did I let you go? Stop right there.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region and the domain lord of the Yuhan region.</p><p>Domain lord Xiang Shan and domain lord Yu Han were both shocked. They didn’t dare to stay any longer and immediately turned to run.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. Like a kun Peng, he rushed toward the two of them and overtook them in a few moments, blocking their path.</p><p>“I told you to stop, did you not hear me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>young hero, young hero, I don’t want the ancient G.o.ds Mountain Map anymore. Take it, take it all you want.</p><p>The region Lord of the elephant Mountain region said hurriedly, his body covered in cold sweat.</p><p>If Lu Ming could kill zone master Youfeng with one shot, he could also kill him with one shot. It would be strange if he was not afraid.</p><p>yes, yes, yes. I don’t want it either. Young hero, please take it.</p><p>Domain lord Yuhan said hurriedly.</p><p>the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain is mine. Don’t leave just yet. I might need you for something else.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>As expected, domain lord Xiang Shan and domain lord Yu Han didn’t dare to move.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain and opened it.</p><p>There were indeed paths leading to a mysterious place, the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>I need you to follow me and find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain through the map.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming was unfamiliar with the ancient G.o.ds star. Even if he had a map, it would be very troublesome to find it. It would be better to borrow the power of the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region and the others to find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain faster.</p><p>As for bringing the domain lord Xiang Shan and the others along, Lu Ming did not mind. He only wanted to obtain some ancient G.o.d flowers on this trip. He did not care about Xiang Shan and the others.</p><p>The eyes of the domain lord of the elephant Mountain domain and the domain lord of the Yuhan domain lit up. They did not expect such a good thing to happen. Lu Ming wanted them to search for the ancient G.o.ds Mountain together. Did it mean that they could enter it as well?</p><p>At the thought of this, their eyes burned with pa.s.sion.</p><p>“Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find it as soon as possible.”</p><p>The domain lord and domain lord Xiang Shan nodded their heads.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He left the place with Xiang Shan and the rest, not staying at the fu clan.</p><p>With the death of region Lord Youfeng, the fu clan’s crisis would be resolved.</p><p>“Luck, our Fu clan is really lucky this time.”</p><p>that’s right. I met young hero Lu Ming. G.o.d has blessed my Fu family!</p><p>young hero Lu Ming is the fu family’s greatest benefactor. We must make him into a G.o.d statue and worship him every day.</p><p>Looking in the direction that Lu Ming had left, the fu family members were extremely grateful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
