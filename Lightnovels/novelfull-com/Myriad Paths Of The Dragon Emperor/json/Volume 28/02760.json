There were already a few people waiting on this peak.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique …”</p><p>When these people saw the ancestor of technique, they immediately saluted him.</p><p>“Come, let me introduce you. This is Lu Ming, the one who killed Kang Ji, situ haonan, and the others!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique pointed at Lu Ming and introduced.</p><p>These people looked at Lu Ming one after another, their eyes filled with curiosity and shock.</p><p>“Song mo …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw song mo in the crowd.</p><p>When he first came to the underworld star, he was hunted down by the people from the underworld Hall. Fortunately, song mo saved him and he managed to escape. Later on, song mo even guided him to find the people from the righteous Army. Lu Ming then left the underworld Hall and went to the righteous Army.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, it’s only been a few years. I didn’t expect you to have already reached such a realm. Killing Kang Ji with a flip of your hand, this is really satisfying, really satisfying!”</p><p>Song mo laughed.</p><p>“Big brother song mo, have you removed the restriction on your body?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>“It’s lifted. Once Kang Ji died, the restriction was naturally lifted.” Song mo laughed, her expression relaxed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me introduce them to you. They came from the heaven realm. They used to be controlled by the underworld Hall, but they’re free now.”</p><p>Song mo pointed to the people behind her and introduced.</p><p>In the past, when one cultivated to the level of a demiG.o.d in the heaven realm’s primordial realm, they would leave the heaven realm’s primordial realm and come to the primal universe. However, without exception, they would all be controlled by the underworld Hall and have restrictions placed in their souls. Now that Kang Ji had died, the restrictions were naturally broken.</p><p>“Greetings, seniors …”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“You’re too polite …”</p><p>“The future generations are truly fearsome!”</p><p>“Our heaven realm is really lucky to have such a heaven’s favorite,”</p><p>The others cupped their fists and said.</p><p>“Our heaven realm is really lucky to have such a heaven’s favorite,”</p><p>The others cupped their fists and said.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look at the heaven realm …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes revealed a glimmer of hope. They all came from the heaven realm and the primordial realm, but they had left for countless years and had never returned to take a look. They were naturally looking forward to it.</p><p>Everyone flew towards the entrance of the heaven realm, and soon arrived.</p><p>Looking at the familiar place, Lu Ming felt rather emotional.</p><p>However, it was a pity that Lu Ming could not enter heaven now.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful now. His aura was powerful and his divine power was terrifying. On the other hand, the heaven realm was just a small chiliocosm.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to enter, he might be able to tear the chiliocosm apart or even shatter it if he released a wisp of Qi activity or leaked a trace of divine power.</p><p>Only those below the third level of the void G.o.d Realm could enter the small chiliocosm.</p><p>Or, if one’s cultivation had reached an extremely profound realm where he could perfectly control every bit of Qi movement and divine power in his body, he could also enter a small chiliocosm.</p><p>Lu Ming could not do it now.</p><p>“I can’t go in. If you guys want to go in and take a look, then go in and take a look.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“I’ll go in and take a look!”</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>Suddenly, one figure after another flew toward the entrance of the heaven realm and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, those people came out again.</p><p>it’s alright. Everything is normal inside. It’s just that there’s a lack of people.</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ancestor of technique nodded. Back then, most of the living creatures in the heaven realm and the primordial realm had been brought out. Naturally, there was a lack of people.</p><p>They were prepared to return to the righteous heaven Army and let those who wanted to return to the heaven realm and the primordial realm to live.</p><p>Although the cultivation conditions in the primeval universe were countless times better than those in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, there were also some family-loving people who wanted to go back.</p><p>After staying for a while longer, they left and returned to the righteous Army.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stayed on the true sky planet for a few months to guide Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the rest in their cultivation. With the resources that Lu Ming provided, everyone’s cultivation base improved greatly.</p><p>A few months later, Lu Ming left the true heavenstar with Qiu Yue and headed for the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>More than a month later, he returned to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>If it were any other Kong Xuan sect disciple, they would not be allowed to bring any other disciple in. However, Lu Ming had the Golden token given to him by the Dragon Boat Mountain, so there was no problem.</p><p>After returning to Kong Xuan sect, Lu Ming returned to the outer sect area where he used to live.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back.”</p><p>Lu Ming had just returned and the news of his return had spread to the outer sect.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was simply a legend in the outer sect.</p><p>Back in the dark Dragon secret realm, nine of the top ten virtual G.o.ds on the virtual G.o.d List had joined forces and had broken through to true G.o.d-level, but they were still no match for Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s battle results were simply a legend.</p><p>In less than a day, Huo Quan came to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>elder Huo Quan, congratulations on becoming an inner court elder.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and congratulated Huo Quan the moment he saw him.</p><p>This was because Huo Quan’s attire was different. Moreover, from the ident.i.ty token hanging on his waist, one could tell that this was not the ident.i.ty token of an outer sect elder, but an inner sect elder.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you too. I’m here to congratulate you. You’ve been promoted to an inner disciple. You can move into the inner sect now.”</p><p>Huo Quan laughed.</p><p>“Did I advance!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. This was within his expectations.</p><p>Now that he had already broken through to the true G.o.d Realm, he naturally couldn’t stay in the outer sect anymore. It was also normal for him to be promoted to an inner sect disciple.</p><p>This was also good. In the future, he would not need to rely on the gold token to enter and exit the inner sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me. After you’ve gone through the procedures, you can live in the inner sect.” Huo Quan said.</p><p>“Elder Huo Quan, I have a friend who wants to cultivate with me …”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Qiu Yue.</p><p>Huo Quan looked at Qiu Yue and smiled, ” that’s easy. I’ll help her with the procedures too. She’ll be a disciple of the Kong Xuan sect in the future.</p><p>After that, the two of them followed Huo Quan to go through the formalities and exchanged tokens. Lu Ming became an inner sect disciple and was given a large courtyard in the inner sect area.</p><p>The cultivation environment here was naturally better than the outer gate area.</p><p>Qiuyue, you’re already a demiG.o.d. Next, you’ll break through to the void G.o.d Realm. I’ll take you to the divine pulse tower to cultivate. I think you’ll be able to break through to the void G.o.d Realm very quickly there.</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Yes, young master.”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded obediently.</p><p>Lu Ming then brought Qiu Yue to the divine pulse tower to cultivate.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming becoming an inner sect disciple slowly spread in the inner sect area and caused a stir.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a disciple who had just entered the sect. It had only been a few years, and he had actually been promoted to an inner disciple. Such a cultivation speed was truly shocking. It was hard not to attract attention.</p><p>All the major sects in the inner sect area were discussing and paying attention to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
