The strength of the chill made Lu Ming apprehensive.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately circulated the divine cold force to resist and the situation immediately improved.</p><p>However, a layer of ice crystals still appeared on his body and slowly covered his entire body.</p><p>it turns out that this kid has cultivated the ultimate cold divine power. But even with the ultimate cold divine power, he can’t resist the coldness of the ice platform at all.</p><p>Undercurrent said coldly.</p><p>The Shen power that he cultivated was also not weak. It was not any weaker than the extreme cold Shen power but it still could not stop the erosion of the coldness of the ice platform.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming, ice chains appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the ice chain that had been refined with the icy liquid. Instead, he used the other eight ice chains.</p><p>He mainly wanted to test how effective the other eight ice chains were in resisting the cold.</p><p>The eight ice chains danced in the air and gathered into a ball, surrounding Lu Ming.</p><p>“So it’s a secret technique of the cold attribute.”</p><p>Undercurrent and the other dark ice clan’s heaven’s pride experts were startled.</p><p>“You’re dreaming if you think you can block the coldness of this ice platform with just a cold attribute secret technique.”</p><p>Undercurrent disdainfully said.</p><p>As expected, as soon as undercurrent’s voice fell, the eight ice chains that were shrouding Lu Ming were frozen immediately. They were covered with a thick layer of ice and made cracking sounds. Then, the eight ice chains crumbled at the same time, turning into pieces and disappearing.</p><p>hehe, I knew it. He can’t block the coldness of the ice platform at all. He’s really overestimating himself.</p><p>Undercurrent mocked.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the sound of the undercurrent. He had expected that the eight chains would not be able to withstand the coldness of the ice platform. In the end, he could only rely on the chain that had melted the icy liquid.</p><p>With a single thought, the chain flew out and wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s this move again. This kid still hasn’t given up. Laughable!</p><p>it has already been proven useless just now, but you still continue to use it. What an idiot!</p><p>The dark ice Race youths mocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was on the ice Soul clan’s side. Mocking Lu Ming was equivalent to mocking the ice Soul Clan. They felt very good.</p><p>However, in the next moment, their voices stopped abruptly.</p><p>Because this time, it was completely different from before.</p><p>This time, there was no layer of ice on the chain around Lu Ming. The chain was moving slowly but it did not show any signs of being frozen.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>The dark ice clan’s young men were bewildered.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward. He was very fast and took more than ten steps in a row.</p><p>as expected, this ice chain can block the cold from the outside world.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>The ice chains wrapped around him, completely blocking the coldness from the outside world. He could not feel the slightest bit of coldness.</p><p>Not a single bit of coldness seeped in.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to take steps, one step at a time without any pause. Soon, he had taken a few hundred steps. The distance he had covered was further than the distance he had covered with the ice and undercurrent.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>“How is that possible? How was this possible? Why is that kid not afraid of the cold on the ice platform?”</p><p>“It’s just a secret technique, how can it block the cold from the ice platform?”</p><p>The dark ice clan’s people’s eyes were wide open. They couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Especially undercurrent, his heart was filled with anger.</p><p>Just now, he was still mocking Lu Ming, saying that Lu Ming was overestimating his ability. However, Lu Ming had already gone further than him. This was a slap in the face.</p><p>Bing Qing’s eyes lit up as well. Lu Ming’s ability to walk so far was beyond his expectations. He was filled with a glimmer of hope that Lu Ming could obtain the ice jade chilling heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps did not stop. He walked forward step by step. After a while, Lu Ming finally arrived at the center of the ice platform. The ice jade cold heart was right above his head.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the ice chain flew out, then wrapped around the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>As soon as the ice jade cold heart was entangled, Lu Ming felt a shocking chill through the ice chain. Fortunately, the ice chain had refined the ball of icy liquid. Otherwise, it would not have been able to withstand the chill.</p><p>But now, it was blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Crimson Jade box and controlled the ice chain. With a pull, the ice jade cold heart was slowly pulled and flew toward the jade box.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The dark ice clan’s Warriors shouted, their eyes red with envy.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Bing Qing let out a long laugh.</p><p>He had never expected that inviting Lu Ming and the rest would be of such great use.</p><p>The reason why the ice Soul Clan had invited the elites of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans was mainly to help them clear out the desolate beasts or deal with other dangers. As for obtaining the ice jade frozen heart, it would still depend on the elites of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to get the ice jade cold heart, even though the ice Soul Clan could not.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the end, the ice jade cold heart entered the Crimson Jade box successfully. Lu Ming immediately closed the jade box. The runes on the jade box glowed and formed an array, sealing the ice jade cold heart inside. The coldness on the ice jade cold heart disappeared immediately and the coldness on the ice platform weakened greatly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the entire ice platform started to shake violently.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the entire ice platform exploded into pieces, sending debris flying everywhere.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>The moment the ice platform exploded, Lu Ming saw rocks the size of human heads flying out from the bottom of the ice platform.</p><p>These stones were round and emitted a faint moonlight, like a bright moon.</p><p>Cold Moon Stone!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This was exactly the same as the legendary Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>There were actually Cold Moon Stones under the ice platform. Lu Ming swept his gaze across and found six of them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he pounced toward the Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>“Kill that brat and take the icy jade chilling heart!”</p><p>go! undercurrent shouted. His figure burst out and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other members of the dark ice Clan also rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Bing Qing had been keeping an eye on undercurrent and the others for a long time. As soon as the undercurrent rushed out, Bing Qing’s figure also rushed out and rushed towards the undercurrent. A sword light filled with coldness slashed towards the undercurrent.</p><p>The two of them began to fight intensely.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he grabbed a Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>The Cold Moon Stone was different from the ice jade cold heart. It was warm to the touch, and one could not feel any bone-piercing coldness.</p><p>After grabbing it, Lu Ming kept it in his storage ring and then grabbed the other Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>In an instant, three Cold Moon Stones had already entered Lu Ming’s storage ring.</p><p>At this moment, the dark ice Clan had arrived.</p><p>“Brat, hand over the icy jade cold heart!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More than a dozen dark ice clansmen attacked at the same time, launching a storm of attacks on Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
