I’d like to see who is so arrogant. Will your strength be enough to convince the ma.s.ses?”</p><p>The other young woman also spoke with an impatient expression.</p><p>The others didn’t say anything, but their gloomy faces spoke for themselves.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man raised his head and looked at the sky. The others also looked over.</p><p>In the sky, two figures were approaching. They were Lu Ming and elder Huo Quan.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huo Quan landed on the ground.</p><p>“Elder Huo Quan!”</p><p>The young men and women cupped their fists and saluted Huo Quan respectfully.</p><p>They all knew in their hearts that although Huo Quan was only an outer sect elder, his true ident.i.ty was a Grand disciple of the sect master, Long Zhou’s Mountain. He was highly regarded by the sect master, and his current position as an outer sect elder was just a trial.</p><p>Even many inner sect elders would be polite to Huo Quan when they saw him, so they naturally didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>Huo Quan waved his hand and said.</p><p>The nine young men stood up and cast a glance at Lu Ming, completely ignoring him.</p><p>“Elder Huo Quan, you said you were going to bring our Captain here, but why don’t I see him? We’ve been waiting for two days!”</p><p>that’s right! Who is it that is so arrogant that even elder Huo Quan can’t invite him? ”</p><p>Everyone chimed in. They had never thought that Lu Ming was the person they had been waiting for.</p><p>The ident.i.ty token hanging on Lu Ming’s body showed that he was an outer sect disciple. How could an outer sect disciple be the person they were waiting for? moreover, he was their team leader?</p><p>They thought that Lu Ming was just a Lackey of Huo Quan.</p><p>“You don’t have to wait. He’s here. Come, let me introduce him to you. This is Lu Ming. He’ll be your team leader for this mission.”</p><p>Huo Quan pointed at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The nine young men and women were stunned. They stared at Lu Ming and then at Huo Quan.</p><p>“Him? Elder Huo Quan, did you make a mistake? He’s just an outer sect disciple, yet he wants to carry out a mission with us. Wouldn’t he be a burden to us?”</p><p>and he’s our team leader. What a joke!</p><p>Two young men immediately shouted.</p><p>“Kid, you better hand over the captain’s flag.”</p><p>that’s right. Hand it over quickly. Don’t think that we don’t know your purpose. You’re there to get points, but don’t think that you’ll harm us because of your greed!</p><p>……</p><p>The rest of the people pointed their Spears at Lu Ming.</p><p>The mission this time was completed, and everyone could get 20000 points.</p><p>20,000 points was 200 million divine gems. It was a huge sum even for ordinary inner disciples.</p><p>They felt that Lu Ming was envious of the reward and that was why he followed them to get the points.</p><p>“Get points? Greedy?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart. He glanced at the nine young men and women indifferently and said,”The news I received is that you’re the team leader for this mission. You all have to listen to my orders. You want to rebel now?”</p><p>“Bullsh * t, what rebellion? Don’t think too highly of yourself, Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>“That’s right, hand over the captain’s flag and get lost!”</p><p>A few of them were instantly enraged and berated loudly. Their cold aura pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, Huo Quan’s shout made everyone quiet down.</p><p>Huo Quan’s expression turned to the nine young men and women with displeasure as he said, ” “Let me tell you, this mission was personally a.s.signed by the sect master. Lu Ming is the team leader, and the sect master personally named him. If you have any objections, you can talk to the sect master directly!”</p><p>The nine young men looked at each other. How would they dare to look for the sect master?</p><p>“Are you guys doubting the sect master’s vision?” Huo Quan asked again.</p><p>“This disciple doesn’t dare!”</p><p>The nine young men and women hurriedly said.</p><p>since you don’t dare to, then follow my orders. I’m telling you, you have to follow Lu Ming’s orders for this operation. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Huo Quan’s eyes gleamed as he spoke, and his body began to exude a powerful and icy aura.</p><p>“Yes, yes …”</p><p>The nine young men and women nodded repeatedly. However, although they nodded on the surface, no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>alright, let’s go. I’ll take you to the teleportation formation. Then, we’ll go to the ice Soul Clan through the teleportation formation.</p><p>let’s go! Huo Quan said as he turned around and left. The others quickly followed.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was very far away from the ice Soul Clan. They were separated by many galaxies. Even though they took the teleportation formation, it still took them more than a month. Finally, they arrived on a planet. Huo Quan did not continue to send them there because they were already in the territory of the ice Soul Clan. They were received by the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Is this the ice Soul Clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the ice Soul Clan members curiously.</p><p>The appearance of the ice Soul Clan was not much different from that of human beings. The biggest difference was their hair and pupils, which were both snow-white.</p><p>His skin was also slightly whiter than that of an ordinary human, and he exuded a frosty aura as he walked.</p><p>“Everyone, follow us!”</p><p>An old man from the ice Soul Clan smiled and led Lu Ming and the others to the main planet of the ice Soul Clan, the ice Soul Planet.</p><p>They arrived at ice Soul Star after a few days.</p><p>Ice Soul Star, as its name suggested, was a real ice planet. The entire planet was sealed in ice.</p><p>Everywhere on the planet was freezing cold.</p><p>Most of the buildings in the ice Soul clan’s main city were made of ice that had been frozen for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan brought Lu Ming and the others to a Hall. The hall was filled with hundred-million-year-old ice. The cold air was overbearing and the temperature was extremely low. If it were not for their profound cultivation skills, they would have been frozen into popsicles.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt very comfortable.</p><p>He had cultivated the ultimate cold divine technique and could control the ultimate cold divine power. As the divine power circulated, the cold air outside continuously gushed into Lu Ming’s body. He felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>young heroes, for this mission, apart from the Kong Xuan sect, the ice Soul Clan has also invited some other sect prodigies from the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Some of them haven’t arrived yet and will have to wait a few days. You can stay here for the next few days!</p><p>The old man from the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“There are people from other sects?”</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved, and they revealed curious expressions. They were curious about what the mission this time was.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan did not say much. They simply explained a few things and left.</p><p>After the ice Soul Clan left, Lu Ming strode to a room. He planned to cultivate while he waited.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
