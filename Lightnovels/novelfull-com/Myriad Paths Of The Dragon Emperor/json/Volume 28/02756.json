He sent out a pitch-black palm print, which made the ancestor of technique’s heart palpitate.</p><p>He couldn’t be bothered to chase after Kang Ji. The ancestor of technique slashed out with all his strength, and a bright sword light burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the ancestor of technique’s sword radiance hit the black palm print. The sword radiance couldn’t withstand it and collapsed under a shock. The palm print didn’t stop and continued to attack the ancestor of technique.</p><p>The ancestor of technique used his sword to block, but he was sent flying thousands of miles away by the palm print. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face was extremely pale.</p><p>what a terrifying strength. Is this the fighting strength of the inner disciples of the unique devil Academy? ”</p><p>The ancestor of technique thought to himself, and a hint of helplessness appeared in his eyes.</p><p>This young man in embroidered clothes had a cultivation as high as stage six true G.o.d Realm. Moreover, his fighting power was extremely powerful, far from what Kang Ji and the like could compare to.</p><p>Even if they were at the same level, the ancestor of technique wasn’t confident that he could defeat this person.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army revealed looks of despair.</p><p>powerful, powerful. The inner sanctum disciple of the unique devil Academy is indeed powerful. Ha ha, fa Ming, go to h.e.l.l!</p><p>Kang Ji roared madly in his heart. His eyes were extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Your strength is not bad. It’s not easy to have someone like you in the chaotic astral River. How about this, hand over your secret technique. Also, in the future, become my dog and work for me. If you do that, I can spare your life!”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes had his hands behind his back and looked down at the ancestor of technique with an arrogant expression.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique laughed heartily. if you want to kill me, then kill me. If you want me to bow down and become your dog, dream on. Also, if you want my secret technique, dream on.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p><p>The young man’s face turned cold. Divine power circulated all over his body, and cold killing intent filled the air. At the same time, a battle blade as black as ink appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying blade light flashed and slashed at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>The ancestor of technique used all his strength to block with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword light dissipated. The ancestor of technique grunted and flew thousands of miles away. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. His body was covered in small knife wounds.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was no match for the young man in embroidered clothes. The difference in cultivation was too great.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>The faces of the righteous Army turned pale with fright.</p><p>Kang Ji and the others were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>you really don’t know your place if you want to fight against senior brother Luo.</p><p>On the side, Kang long, situ Xiao, and the others sneered.</p><p>“I’ll ask you one more time. Are you going to hand over the secret technique or not?”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes asked again.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then kill me. If you want the secret art, then dream on.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique sneered.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, Dark Demon Divine Blade!”</p><p>The young man was furious. His divine power burst forth, and all the power in his body gathered to form a terrifying blade light that charged toward the ancestor of technique.</p><p>In his rage, the young man in embroidered clothes had already used his full power for this blade. The power was extremely shocking. An ordinary stage five true G.o.d would have been killed in one blade.</p><p>The terrifying blade light pressed down on the ancestor of technique. The ancestor of technique would definitely not be able to withstand this blade and would die under it.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army cried out.</p><p>“If you die, then die!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique let out a long roar and used all his strength. Even if he was going to die, he would die brilliantly and die in battle. He would not just wait helplessly for death.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>However, at this moment, a violent boom came from the depths of the sky. Explosions kept ringing out in the air.</p><p>Many people looked up subconsciously.</p><p>“That is … A Starship.”</p><p>what a beautiful Starship. What kind of Starship is this? it actually charged into the atmosphere.</p><p>Many people had different thoughts.</p><p>An ordinary person would stop after entering the atmosphere on an interplanetary warship. However, this interplanetary warship didn’t stop at all. It was heading straight for the headquarters of the righteous sky Army at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes was also stunned, because he realized that the starry sky battleship was actually charging toward him.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat and he changed the direction of his blade. Instead of slashing at the ancestor of technique, he slashed at the starry sky battleship.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blade light hit the interplanetary warship, but the warship was not damaged at all. On the other hand, the young man in the brocade robe was forced back and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The interplanetary warship also stopped in the air.</p><p>Many people looked at the interplanetary warship, especially the people of the righteous Army, with a hint of hope in their eyes.</p><p>It was obvious that the Starship was heading towards the young man. Did they come to help?</p><p>“Who is it? Get out here.”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes squinted his eyes and shouted angrily.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The door of the Starship opened and a figure walked out.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, it’s you.”</p><p>The first one to shout was none other than Kang long.</p><p>He had been thinking about taking revenge on Lu Ming every day. Naturally, he had a deep impression of Lu Ming and could recognize him at a glance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him. Lu Ming is back.”</p><p>why is it him? did he bring the experts from the Kong Xuan sect? ”</p><p>The people from the righteous Army were stunned. Then, the hope in their eyes intensified. They hoped that Lu Ming had brought the powerhouses from the Kong Xuan sect. Then, they might be saved today.</p><p>“It’s this brat …”</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, and the others “eyes also emitted a cold light.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was also shocked.</p><p>“Boy, so you’re Lu Ming.”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>He had heard of Lu Ming’s name before. First of all, Lu Ming had come in first in the previous Qin Tian thirteen clan a.s.sessment. He had also heard Kang Ji, situ Xiao, and situ Feng mention him before.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. I’m the real one.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and swept his gaze across the entire place. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that everyone was fine. They had finally arrived.</p><p>who else from Kong Xuan sect has come? come out. Today, the Yimo Academy is doing something. Let’s see who dares to stop us!</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes said coldly. His gaze skipped Lu Ming and looked at the door of the interplanetary warship.</p><p>He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all. He was just a new disciple of the Kong Xuan sect. He could kill him with one finger.</p><p>Obviously, he had no idea about Lu Ming’s performance in the ice Soul Clan. Otherwise, he would not have been so arrogant.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m alone today. There’s no one else.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He waved his hand and kept the interplanetary warship.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming is alone.”</p><p>“This is terrible!”</p><p>Hearing this, the faces of the righteous Army soldiers changed. They had some hope, but it turned into despair.</p><p>Lu Ming was alone. What could he do? He couldn’t change the outcome.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of the ancestral Dragon, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the others also changed drastically. They were extremely worried.</p><p>hahaha, this kid actually came alone. He’s really courting death!</p><p>that’s good. Today is the perfect day to get rid of him. It’s killing two birds with one stone. I don’t have to find a chance to kill him in the future. The heavens are really helping me!</p><p>Kang Ji, Kang long, situ haonan and the rest laughed out loud in their hearts. They were extremely happy.</p><p>At first, Lu Ming had joined the Kong Xuan sect. His talent was also extremely shocking, which made them afraid. They had thought that after they had destroyed the righteous Army, they would find a way to kill Lu Ming and get rid of future trouble. They did not expect Lu Ming to deliver himself to them. There was no reason for them to not be happy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
