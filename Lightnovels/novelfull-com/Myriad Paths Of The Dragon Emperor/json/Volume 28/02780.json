The blood mist in the formation didn’t become thicker. Instead, it became thinner.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, you little b.a.s.t.a.r.d, what have you done? Stop, stop!”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared madly. He was about to go crazy.</p><p>The energy he had absorbed from the ancient G.o.d flower had all been absorbed by Lu Ming. His own energy, blood, and essence had all been turned into blood Qi for Lu Ming to absorb.</p><p>His essence Qi was being seriously consumed, and his body was quickly shriveling.</p><p>This made him extremely frightened.</p><p>At this moment, there was a Crimson light spot shining at Lu Ming’s heart. Energy from the ” quant.i.ty ” formula was constantly surging and gathering at his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart.</p><p>On the ground, the ancient G.o.d flowers that had covered the entire mountain were also shriveling.</p><p>“This is … The backlash …”</p><p>Gu Bo’s eyes brightened, as if he had seen through something. He was very surprised.</p><p>This way, at least the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds wouldn’t have to be buried with them.</p><p>“Close the formation, close the formation!”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared.</p><p>First elder and the others quickly shut down the array. The light barrier disappeared, and the blood-colored mist disappeared as well.</p><p>However, Gu Xiong did not obtain his freedom.</p><p>He had been completely pinned down and merged with the formation. As long as the Liang word formula did not let go, he would not be free.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, kill, go and kill that brat!”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>First elder and the rest charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. Everyone, let’s attack together and stop them!”</p><p>Gu Bo roared.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>With the disappearance of the formation, the people who were trapped in the formation could naturally attack. They launched an attack on the first elder and the others in anger.</p><p>There were many of them. All of them attacked and blocked the attacks of the first elder and the others.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Gu Shang and Gu Ling were under Gu Xiong’s control. They followed Gu Xiong’s orders and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s stop the two of them together.”</p><p>Gu Bo gathered his remaining strength and brought a few heavenly G.o.d Realm elders to attack Gu Shang and Gu Ling.</p><p>Although Gu Bo and the others were at a disadvantage, they were able to delay their movements.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? I’m going to lead the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds to glory, so why are you stopping me? you’ve betrayed your ancestors.”</p><p>Gu Xiong cursed like a Mad Dog.</p><p>“Gu Xiong, you’ve gone completely mad. You’ve sacrificed so many of your clansmen for your own selfish reasons. You’re the one who has betrayed your ancestors.”</p><p>Gu Bo coldly shouted.</p><p>However, Gu Xiong didn’t seem to hear him. He just kept cursing.</p><p>At this moment, his body had already shriveled up and turned into skin and bones, like a skeleton.</p><p>His Qi essence and blood essence were almost completely absorbed. Even if the quant.i.ty formula stopped now, he was already a cripple.</p><p>The divine fire in his body had been completely extinguished.</p><p>At the same time, the ancient G.o.d flowers that covered the entire mountain had completely shriveled up. All the energy was absorbed by the ” quant.i.ty ” formula and gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Ancient G.o.d’s heart, condense!”</p><p>The bone demon shouted in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart had completely changed. It was filled with a piercing blood-red color and was filled with endless energy. It was beating non-stop.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>All of a sudden, extremely pure qi and blood gushed out from his heart and seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s body in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming’s divine body was transforming rapidly. It was improving at an alarming rate.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d’s heart had been successfully condensed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the moment when the ancient G.o.d’s heart was successfully condensed, Lu Ming seemed to hear a loud roar from his heart that seemed to come from ancient times.</p><p>He seemed to see an incomparably huge ancient G.o.d rampaging through the universe. With a punch, a star would explode.</p><p>At that moment, not only was Lu Ming’s divine body improving rapidly, but his cultivation was also improving rapidly.</p><p>With an astonishing speed, he got closer to peak first stage true G.o.d.</p><p>Soon, his cultivation reached the peak of stage one true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A loud boom erupted from his body, and his cultivation broke through to the second stage of true G.o.d Realm smoothly.</p><p>Moreover, it was rapidly charging towards peak stage two true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Ah, why?”</p><p>On the altar, Gu Xiong let out a miserable shriek.</p><p>He knew that he had been completely defeated. He had become a cripple, and his life was hanging by a thread.</p><p>As Gu Xiong was crippled, Gu Shang and Gu Ling’s bodies trembled violently and they suddenly stopped. Initially, their eyes were filled with confusion, but at this moment, they regained their consciousness.</p><p>“Gu Bo, stop!”</p><p>Gu Shang roared.</p><p>“Gu Shang, you’ve recovered?” Gu Bo stopped and was overjoyed.</p><p>“I’ve recovered!”</p><p>Gu Shang nodded and looked around. He sighed and said, ” “Good, good, I almost made a big mistake!”</p><p>“Gu Xiong and Gu Luo …”</p><p>Gu Ling’s eyes were extremely cold as he looked at the great elder and the others. His body moved and he rushed towards the great elder, sending a palm strike down.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>what? ” the first elder was shocked and tried to block, but he was no match for Gu Ling. He was suppressed by Gu Ling’s palm and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Gu Bo, Gu Shang and the others also rushed over. The people who followed Gu Xiong were instantly suppressed.</p><p>“Why is it like this?”</p><p>The first elder was at a loss. Finally, his gaze fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was blood-red, and he exuded a sense of Majesty. This Majesty made all the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds feel apprehensive.</p><p>This was the suppression of their blood vessels. This meant that Lu Ming’s blood vessels were much stronger than theirs.</p><p>ancient G.o.d’s heart. He has actually condensed the ancient G.o.d’s heart.</p><p>Gu Shang muttered to himself in shock.</p><p>it’s indeed the ancient G.o.d’s heart. I really didn’t expect that Gu Xiong’s scheme would end up benefiting someone else’s disciple. Gu Bo also laughed.</p><p>However, such an ending was already the best ending. The crisis of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had finally pa.s.sed.</p><p>At that moment, the aura on Lu Ming’s body slowly stabilized. The energy fluctuations on his body also disappeared.</p><p>it’s a pity that I’m just a little bit away from reaching the third stage of true G.o.d.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Now, his cultivation was peak second stage true G.o.d.</p><p>kid, you’re still not satisfied after getting such a great opportunity. Most of the ancient G.o.d flower’s energy was used to condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart. Your cultivation has only increased by a little bit, and your divine body has also increased by several times. You should be satisfied.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>senior, what’s the use of the ancient G.o.d’s heart? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>forming the ancient G.o.d’s heart has already given you a rich ancient G.o.d bloodline. The ancient G.o.d’s heart will automatically absorb the energy from the outside world to strengthen your divine body. Even if you don’t cultivate in the future, your divine body will continue to grow. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“It can continue to grow without cultivating?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. This function was really heaven-defying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
