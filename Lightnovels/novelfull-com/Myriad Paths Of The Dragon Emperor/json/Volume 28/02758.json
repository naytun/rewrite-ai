His body flashed and he moved like a kun Peng. At the same time, the long spear in his hand continued to stab.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Rays of spear light pierced towards Kang Ji, situ haonan, sanguine red guild leader and the rest.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, and the rest were so scared that they almost peed their pants. They screamed madly and tried to block the attacks as they fled. However, with their cultivation, they were completely vulnerable in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>As the spear radiance flew past, they were all pierced and died on the spot.</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, the master of the b.l.o.o.d.y red society and the rest, a total of seven to eight stage four true G.o.d experts were killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>“Kill! Attack together!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique roared, his voice reverberating through the entire area.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>“Kill all these b.a.s.t.a.r.ds!”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army also charged out and attacked the people of the serene darkness Palace and the Walkabout sect.</p><p>Although the powers like the serene Palace and the Walkabout sect were much stronger than the righteous Army, they had lost all their morale. All they knew was to flee, and they couldn’t form any combat power at all. Instead, they were being slaughtered by the righteous Army, resulting in countless deaths and injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and charged towards Kang long, situ Xiao, and situ Feng.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die. terrible death. Ah …”</p><p>Kang long and the rest knew that they would not be able to survive today. They cursed madly but before they could finish their words, Lu Ming had shot them dead.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming charged towards the true G.o.d powerhouses of the major forces.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming pa.s.sed by, real G.o.ds would be killed one by one. With a sweep of his spear, a large number of experts would be blasted apart.</p><p>“We surrender, we surrender.”</p><p>“We are willing to surrender!”</p><p>The people from the major factions all shouted and raised their hands in surrender.</p><p>we won’t kill those who surrender, but they must swear on their life source that they will forever be loyal to the righteous Army.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“I swear, I swear …”</p><p>Immediately, a large number of people swore their loyalty to the righteous Army.</p><p>The killing had stopped, and the higher-ups of the you Luo Palace, freedom sect, and the other sects had either died or surrendered. All of them belonged to the righteous Army.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with complicated expressions.</p><p>It had only been a short while since Lu Ming appeared. The situation that they were bound to lose had been reversed in an instant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I can’t believe that your cultivation has already reached such a level in just a few decades.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique flew over and smiled.</p><p>“I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>Lu Ming had nothing else to do next. The ancestor of technique began to send people from the righteous Army to take over the territories controlled by the nether Hall, carefree sect, and other forces. The strength of the righteous Army would definitely soar.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming had already met with the ancestral Dragon, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the others.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, and the others naturally had extremely complicated feelings.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming, a rising star in the heaven realm, had already left them far behind.</p><p>“Senior, these things are for you …”</p><p>Lu Ming took out some storage rings and pa.s.sed them to zu long and the rest. There were some cultivation resources inside that were suitable for virtual G.o.d-level cultivation.</p><p>“Senior, where are my parents?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“They’re behind us. Come with us.”</p><p>Zu long and the rest brought Lu Ming to the back mountain of the righteous Army. They saw Lu Yuntian, Qiu Yue, Lu shenhuang, and the rest.</p><p>In the primal universe, everyone’s cultivation had made great progress.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s cultivation base had actually reached the great emperor realm.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, her cultivation base had already reached the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>The one who progressed the fastest was actually Lu shenhuang. He had already reached the first level of ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>It had only been a few decades. Lu shenhuang had only stayed on the true heavenstar to cultivate and did not have any fortuitous encounters. Yet, he had already become a G.o.d, which was far beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Lu shenhuang’s talent was much stronger than he had imagined.</p><p>Divine wilderness, Qiu Yue, follow me.</p><p>Lu Ming said. He brought Qiu Yue and Lu shenhuang to the peak of a mountain. There was no one else there.</p><p>Qiuyue, divine wilderness, I will now teach you a mystical technique. However, this mystical technique is extremely important. You must not reveal it. Other than the two of you, you can not teach it to anyone else. Especially you, divine wilderness. You can not even teach Chi ‘er. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Lu Ming warned seriously.</p><p>He planned to pa.s.s the heaven and earth thousand Dao Arts to Qiu Yue and Lu shenhuang.</p><p>With their talents, they would definitely be able to achieve something. It was not impossible for them to cultivate to the level of a ruler. Especially for Lu shenhuang, the chances were very high.</p><p>However, the Qian Kun thousand Dao Arts was mysterious and unpredictable. If it were to spread, it would probably cause a huge wave. When that time came, they would all be in danger.</p><p>“Yes, father!”</p><p>“Yes, young master!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang and Qiu Yue nodded their heads.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming pa.s.sed the ” universe thousand Dao mantra ” to Qiu Yue and Lu shenhuang.</p><p>The two of them looked at it carefully. After looking at it, their eyes revealed a deep shock. They were shocked by the profoundness of the universe thousand Dao Arts.</p><p>&Nbsp; cultivating the universe thousand Dao Arts not only allowed one to cultivate ruler divine power, but one could also cultivate other divine power and control multiple divine powers at the same time. This was simply too shocking.</p><p>They finally understood why Lu Ming had warned them not to spread it. They could not spread it to others.</p><p>The more people who knew about it, the higher the possibility of it spreading.</p><p>They knew the implications of this, and they decided in their hearts that they would never pa.s.s it on to a second person.</p><p>“Father, have a good chat with aunt Qiuyue. I’ll go back to cultivate first!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang said. He then gave Lu Ming a ‘you know’ look, chuckled, and soared into the sky.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and scolded.</p><p>“Young master …”</p><p>Qiu Yue pulled Lu Ming’s hand and called out to him softly. Her eyes were filled with longing.</p><p>Qiuyue, this time, come with me to the Kong Xuan sect to cultivate. ye mo said.</p><p>Lu Ming said gently.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes lit up and she nodded. “Good, good!”</p><p>“Come, let’s take a walk.”</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and strolled in the void.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue only returned to their residence at midnight.</p><p>“Long Chen, desolate power …”</p><p>As soon as he returned, Lu Ming saw Long Chen, desolate force, and the others.</p><p>After coming to the desolate universe, Long Chen and the others ‘cultivation had improved a lot. They had all reached the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Dragon Star, desolate power … This is for you.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few storage rings and tossed them to Long Chen and the rest.</p><p>Long Chen and the others received it, but there was no joy on their faces. They seemed to have something to say, but they hesitated.</p><p>“Long Chen, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that they were different.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and miss Mu Lan are in trouble …”</p><p>Long Chen sighed and said.</p><p>“What? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“It’s like this. Some time ago, miss Mu Lan, Huang Ling, and the others went out on an adventure. They went to a forest on the true Heavenly Star, but they never returned. We went to look for them, but we couldn’t find any trace of them. We wanted to report to the ancestor of technique, but we ran into the serene Palace and the carefree sect’s attack, so we delayed this matter …”</p><p>Long Chen explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
