No one could compare to it.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins all looked solemn. If this continued, the position of the future sect master would probably fall to the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>I must get that thing. That way, I will be able to fight against the Supreme Holy Son!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son clenched his fists.</p><p>“Alright, I hereby announce that the sect compet.i.tion has officially ended!”</p><p>The sect leader of Kong Xuan sect, long zhousan’s voice resounded throughout the entire area. However, he paused for a moment before he continued, ” “However, I still have a big announcement to make today.”</p><p>“There’s something big to announce?”</p><p>Many people were stunned and revealed curious expressions.</p><p>Even most of the inner sect elders revealed curious expressions. It was obvious that they didn’t know what Dragon Boat Mountain was going to announce.</p><p>“Today, I’m going to confer a new Saint t.i.tle!”</p><p>The voices of Dragon Boat Mountain rang out together.</p><p>“What? A new Holy Son?”</p><p>“He’s going to be made a Saint? This is a big deal, but there hasn’t been anyone suitable for it recently!”</p><p>that’s right. The only suitable candidate is the number two figure from the Supreme Holy son’s faction. Is he going to be independent? ”</p><p>The Dragon boats mountain’s words caused the entire place to clamor. Everyone was speculating who the Dragon boats mountain was going to confer as the son of Saint.</p><p>It was not that easy to become a saint. First, one had to be a heavenly G.o.d and the divine power they could control had to be above the divine grade.</p><p>Only by fulfilling these two conditions would one be qualified.</p><p>And now, there was only one person who fulfilled these two conditions, and that was the second in command of the Supreme sect.</p><p>This person was also a peerless genius. Back then, he had the opportunity to be conferred the t.i.tle of Saint. However, he gave up the position of Saint and sided with the Supreme Saint. This caused a huge uproar back then.</p><p>The seven Holy Sons and holy virgins also frowned.</p><p>The eighth Saint was about to appear.</p><p>Canonizing a son was a big deal. It meant that their compet.i.tion would be even greater. Furthermore, every additional son would have a huge impact on the current situation.</p><p>Everyone was trying to guess who the Dragon boats mountain was going to confer upon as their Saint. However, they didn’t feel confident.</p><p>Then, everyone’s gazes fell on Dragon Boat Mountain, waiting for their answer.</p><p>The Dragon boats stood high in the sky and looked around. Their gaze finally landed on Lu Ming and they said loudly,”The Holy Son I’m going to confer on him is Lu Ming!”</p><p>As he said that, Dragon Boat Mountain pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming. Then, the entire place fell into a dead silence.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was also dumbfounded.</p><p>He had never expected that the new Saint that Dragon Boat Mountain was going to confer upon him would actually be him.</p><p>Initially, just like the others, he was curious to know who the newly-conferred son was. He did not expect it to be him.</p><p>For a moment, he couldn’t quite wrap his head around it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is a mission I’m giving you. You must accept the position of the Holy Son!”</p><p>Lu Ming heard the voice of the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“What the h.e.l.l is this old man doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming finally calmed down slowly and his mind was racing.</p><p>He didn’t think that Dragon boat’s Mountain had good intentions. This old fellow had placed the dark Dragon blood Curse in his body, so he definitely didn’t have good intentions.</p><p>“Lu … Ming, you’ve become a saint!”</p><p>“Bull … You’re awesome, brother!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were also dumbfounded and could not recover from their shock for a long time.</p><p>it’s him. Is he the son that the sect master is going to confer on you? ”</p><p>Everyone stared at Lu Ming, dumbfounded.</p><p>“The key is, who is he?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had only joined the Kong Xuan sect for a few decades, while many people would go into seclusion for hundreds or thousands of years. Most people had not seen Lu Ming before.</p><p>it’s him. I know him. He just entered the sect decades ago!</p><p>“What? He was conferred the t.i.tle of Holy Son when he just entered the sect decades ago. You must be joking!”</p><p>shush! Lower your voice! Be careful not to be heard by the sect master!</p><p>but how is this kid qualified to be the Saint? ”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming, a person who had just joined the sect a few decades ago, was actually conferred the t.i.tle of Saint. What was going on?</p><p>“It’s this brat …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others all glared at Lu Ming with sword-like eyes.</p><p>“Sect master, this subordinate feels that this matter is inappropriate!”</p><p>At this moment, an old man walked out and cupped his fists towards the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“What’s wrong with it?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said indifferently.</p><p>Lu Ming has only joined the sect for a few decades. His current cultivation base has only broken through to true G.o.d not long ago. No matter how you look at it, he doesn’t have the right to confer the t.i.tle of a Saint!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>The elder was an inner elder and Ying Cang’s master. He was from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>Ying Cang, the heaven’s favorite who was ranked fourth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, had been secretly taken in as a disciple by this person. Later on, he was killed by Lu Ming in the dark Dragon secret realm, and this person had always hated Lu Ming.</p><p>Since dragon boats mountain wanted to confer Lu Ming the t.i.tle of the Holy Son, he naturally had to step out and oppose it.</p><p>“That’s right, sect master, you must not do this!”</p><p>Following that, a few more inner court elders stepped forward to object.</p><p>It was obvious that these inner elders all belonged to the factions of the Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>“Are you all doubting me?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said indifferently, yet he had a terrifying might.</p><p>The few inner court elders were shocked and quickly said, ” I’m not questioning you, sect master. It’s just that the appointment of a Saint is a big matter, after all. Sect master should consider it carefully!</p><p>that’s right. The sect leader, Holy Son, and Holy Virgin are all peerless geniuses. Not everyone is suitable and qualified!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son stepped forward and bowed to the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“Tianhong is right. To become the Holy Son, two conditions must be met. First, one must master the divine grade divine power. Second, one must reach the heavenly G.o.d Realm. Lu Ming is only at the true G.o.d Realm. How can he be qualified to be the Holy Son? sect leader, please retract your order!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection also stepped out and cupped his fists.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain frowned.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, the status of the Holy Sons and holy virgins was even higher than that of the inner elders.</p><p>The Holy Sons and holy virgins were all peerless geniuses. It wouldn’t be a problem for them to step into the divine King realm and become the Overlord of a region. Their words would carry much more weight than the inner sect elders.</p><p>After that, the Saint son Zhi Xia, the Saint son Yan Kong, and the Saint daughter Xue Tan all spoke, persuading the Dragon Boat Mountain to take back their orders.</p><p>Only two of the seven Holy Sons and holy virgins didn’t speak.</p><p>The first was the Supreme Holy Son!</p><p>He only sized Lu Ming up curiously, his eyes glistening but he did not say anything.</p><p>Naturally, Ouyang Xiangxiang would not say much.</p><p>She and Lu Ming were partners. If Lu Ming could become the Saint, he would be of greater help to her. She hoped that Lu Ming would become the Saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
