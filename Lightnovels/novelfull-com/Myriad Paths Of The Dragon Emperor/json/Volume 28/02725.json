They were like fans, with the middle protruding and the two sides slightly facing back.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other ten walked to their seats. Lu Ming sat down in the middle seat while the rest sat on the two sides.</p><p>The people from the other sects were stunned when they saw where Lu Ming and the rest were seated.</p><p>That was because the middle seat was usually reserved for the captain.</p><p>For the ice Soul Clan, the ninth young master, Bing Qing, sat in the middle.</p><p>The people from the other sects who were sitting in the middle were the team leaders of this mission.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting in the middle. Did that not mean that Lu Ming was the leader of the ten people from Kong Xuan sect?</p><p>A virtual G.o.d-level was the team leader?</p><p>hahaha, laughable, truly laughable. Your Kong Xuan sect actually let a void G.o.d Realm person be the team leader. What a joke!</p><p>The young man from the unique devil Academy who had spoken earlier burst into laughter again. His voice was filled with ridicule.</p><p>the way I see it, there’s really no one left in the Kong Xuan sect. They actually let a void G.o.d Realm person be the leader. I can see how useless the others are. How can such a sect be worthy of being the leader of the top ten sects? ”</p><p>The other young man from the unique devil Academy also sneered.</p><p>The other sects all had mocking expressions on their faces.</p><p>This time, even Bing Qing and the young prodigy of the ice Soul Clan were displeased.</p><p>It was fine to let a virtual G.o.d-level person follow them, but this virtual G.o.d-level person was actually the team leader. They were really looking down on the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>Who did they think the ice Soul Clan was?</p><p>They had invited the paragons of the Kong Xuan sect to help, but they had to give them a lot of benefits. Otherwise, how could Lu Ming and the others get 20000 points each after completing the mission?</p><p>The ice Soul Clan had given the Kong Xuan sect benefits, so the Kong Xuan sect would reward them with a large number of points.</p><p>Now, letting a nihility G.o.d stage expert be the team leader was just like what the young man from the unique devil Academy had said. It was simply a perfunctory task.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, the long-faced young man, the purple-robed young man, and the others looked rather grim. They had already expected this to happen, which was why they wanted to s.n.a.t.c.h Lu Ming’s team leader position.</p><p>you’re all f * cking bullsh * tting. The captain of the Kong Xuan sect is naturally the strongest person. What do you know? ”</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything, but an hai could not help but shout.</p><p>“The strongest person? An ethereal G.o.d Realm expert is your strongest warrior? you’re all trash, hahaha!”</p><p>The young men from the unique demon Academy all laughed with a mocking expression.</p><p>in my opinion, your Kong Xuan sect’s t.i.tle of being the top of the ten top sects is completely undeserved. Why don’t you just give it up? ”</p><p>To the right of Lu Ming’s group, a young man from a sect sneered.</p><p>This sect was one of the Qin heaven thirteen sects, the flowing water sect.</p><p>The flowing water sect could not be considered very strong among the Qin Tian thirteen clans. It was ranked at the bottom. However, the flowing water sect had a very good relationship with the unique demon Academy. They usually followed the unique demon Academy’s lead. Some people even joked that the flowing water sect was a dog of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had a conflict with the unique demon Academy, so they naturally stood on the side of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“You’re just a dog, what are you barking for?”</p><p>An hai retorted very impolitely.</p><p>“What did you just say? A bunch of trash, I think you’d better get lost. Don’t make a fool of yourself here. When you partic.i.p.ate in the mission, you’ll only drag us down.”</p><p>A dark-faced young man from the flowing water sect shouted. He then looked at Lu Ming in disdain and said,”What’s wrong? You’re not convinced? If you’re not convinced, then let’s fight. Kid, I challenge you now.”</p><p>At the end of his sentence, the black-faced young man stood up and pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>that’s right, I want to challenge you. I’m not the leader of the flowing water sect. Now that I’m challenging you, do you dare to accept my challenge? ”</p><p>The black-faced young man shouted.</p><p>He seemed to be impetuous, but he was actually very smart.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming, who was only at the virtual G.o.d Realm, would not be able to withstand a single blow. He was not the leader of the flowing water sect, but he had defeated the leader of the Kong Xuan sect. This was equivalent to him slapping the face of the Kong Xuan sect. Not only could he make himself famous, but he could also curry favor with the geniuses of the Yimo Academy. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>you don’t have the right to make me attack you. An hai, go and teach him a lesson. Make him kneel on the ground and apologize.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up his gla.s.s and took a sip slowly.</p><p>“Good, that’s just what I want.”</p><p>An Hai’s expression was ferocious as he strode toward the flowing water sect.</p><p>Bing Qing’s eyes flashed, but she didn’t stop him.</p><p>The geniuses of the unique demon Academy were also watching with interest.</p><p>“Kid, kneel down!”</p><p>An Hai’s footsteps quickened. Finally, he leaped into the air like a hawk and struck out with his palm toward the black-faced flowing water sect youth.</p><p>The vast palm force was like an avalanche as it pressed towards the black-faced youth.</p><p>The black-faced young man’s expression changed as he continued to punch out with both his fists.</p><p>His fist technique was like flowing water. When he had thrown dozens of punches, the sky was filled with fist shadows. The fist shadows converged into a large river that rushed toward an hai.</p><p>However, an Hai’s cultivation was at stage four true G.o.d Realm, while this black-faced young man was only at stage two true G.o.d Realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>An Hai’s palm force pressed down, and the river of fist shadows that the black-faced young man had sent out collapsed.</p><p>BOOM! The force of the palm was like a mountain, pressing down on the black-faced young man’s body. The black-faced young man screamed in pain and knelt on the ground with a plop.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The other young men from the flowing water sect were enraged. They roared and charged toward an hai, including the flowing water sect’s Captain.</p><p>“Good, all of you, kneel down!”</p><p>An hai revealed a malevolent expression. A long staff appeared in his hand and he swept it out, causing the void to explode with a terrifying boom.</p><p>The sky full of stick shadows was like a mountain range, pressing down on the flowing water sect’s heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The flowing water sect had a total of six youths coming here this time. But the strongest person was only at third stage true G.o.d Realm. He was not an Hai’s match at all.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a series of explosions, the flowing water sect disciples were all sent flying and coughed up blood. Only the captain was in a better state, but he was also sent flying and coughed up blood.</p><p>stage four true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>The captain of the flowing water sect shouted, revealing a shocked expression.</p><p>This time, those who came here had all cultivated for less than ten thousand years. It was absolutely rare to be able to cultivate to stage four true G.o.d within ten thousand years.</p><p>The others were also shocked. They looked at an hai with a grave expression.</p><p>However, they couldn’t figure out why an hai wasn’t the team leader of the Kong Xuan sect with his cultivation level. Instead, the team leader was someone at the eighth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>could it be that the brat has a high status in the Kong Xuan sect and is the descendant of some important figure? ”</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>This was very possible. Otherwise, with an hai and the rest’s cultivation, why would they listen to Lu Ming and make him the team leader?</p><p>how dare you criticize my Kong Xuan sect with your puny cultivation? kneel down and apologize.</p><p>An Hai’s iron rod pressed down toward the flowing water sect’s team leader.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
