They were the ice Soul Clan and the Scarlet Flame clan. Each of these two clans was stronger than any single Overlord sect.</p><p>The two great races together occupied a small half of the Qin Tian Galaxy’s territory.</p><p>Moreover, the ice Soul Clan and the Scarlet Flame clan had never been on good terms. They had been competing with each other for countless years.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan wanted to obtain the ice jade cold heart from the ancestral land, but the Scarlet Flame clan would not allow it.</p><p>Every time, the red flame tribe would send someone to stop them.</p><p>Behind some of the elders of the red flame tribe, there was a group of young experts. In addition to this group of young experts of the red flame tribe, there was also a group of Young heaven’s favorites who were not from the red flame tribe.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize a few familiar faces.</p><p>The Golden Sage of the Vajra race and yang Chong.</p><p>The two of them had competed with Lu Ming during the qintian thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment.</p><p>Later on, the Golden Sage joined the indestructible sword sect, one of the three overlords, while yang Chong joined the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>Needless to say, these youths were all from the other sects of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans. The geniuses of the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land were all here.</p><p>“Red flame tribe, you’ve come.”</p><p>An elder of the ice Soul Clan said coldly.</p><p>“You want to get the Heart of Ice jade and suppress my Scarlet Flame tribe? it’s not that easy.”</p><p>An old man from the Scarlet Flame clan sneered.</p><p>“Don’t even think of stopping me!”</p><p>The elder of the ice Soul Clan said coldly, and a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The dozens of elders of the ice Soul Clan released a shocking aura at the same time. The aura was filled with a terrifying chill. The s.p.a.ce where they were in was instantly frozen and the ice spread toward the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>“Small tricks, melt it.”</p><p>The elder of the red flame tribe shouted. Then, all the experts of the red flame tribe burst into flames. The entire starry sky was about to burn.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>One side was icy cold while the other side was scorching hot. The two sides continued to clash, causing the starry sky to shake violently.</p><p>we’ll block the ice Soul clan’s old farts. You guys charge into that area.</p><p>The overlords of the red flame clan roared and attacked the elder of the ice Soul Clan with various attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The elders of the ice Soul Clan roared and attacked.</p><p>The two sides engaged in an intense battle, and the scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>If the two sides fought on a life planet, it would probably cause a destructive disaster. A battle between such figures was too terrifying. Even a wisp of energy that leaked out could destroy a small world like the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>As the powerhouses from both sides fought, the Scarlet Flame race and the other sects ‘heaven’s favorites took the opportunity to rush into the Rocky area.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The elders of the ice Soul Clan shouted, but they were helpless.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan had gone through a great turmoil countless years ago. Now, their strength was no longer as strong as the red flame clan. The red flame clan had come prepared. If they stopped the ice Soul Clan, they could let the others take the opportunity to rush into the Rocky area. They could not stop them.</p><p>Seeing those young men rush into the area of broken stones, the two sides fought for a while more, then both retreated and faced each other.</p><p>Humph, even if they rush into the area of broken rocks, they might not be able to stop The Prodigy of my ice Soul Clan.</p><p>An elder of the ice Soul Clan snorted.</p><p>“Oh, that might not be the case.”</p><p>An old man from the Scarlet Flame tribe sneered.</p><p>……</p><p>The prodigies of the Scarlet Flame race and the other sects of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans continued to move forward the moment they entered the area of broken rocks. They only stopped after going a long way.</p><p>“Why didn’t you continue?”</p><p>One of the immortal sword sect’s elite asked.</p><p>there’s no rush. We can’t enter the ice Soul clan’s true ancestral land. Moreover, it’s dangerous inside. Let’s wait here. When the ice Soul Clan enters the ancestral land, even if they manage to obtain the ice jade cold heart, they’ll be greatly injured. We’ll wait here and catch them off guard. We can kill them easily.</p><p>A tall and st.u.r.dy young man from the red flame tribe said.</p><p>“Brilliant plan.”</p><p>The others gasped in admiration. Then, they set up a concealment array in this area.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were moving forward and did not know what happened after that.</p><p>This rocky area was very long. They had no idea how many miles they had traveled. The distance they had traveled could be measured in hundreds of millions of miles.</p><p>These were formed from the explosion of a life planet. One could only imagine how long it had been.</p><p>After six or seven days of traveling, they had reached the end of the Rocky area. A huge light screen appeared in front of them, blocking their way.</p><p>“Behind this light screen is my clan’s ancestral land. Only the token of my clan can open it.”</p><p>Bing Qing explained, and then took out a statue.</p><p>The statue was only a foot tall, and it seemed to be carved out of ice. It was crystal clear and exuded a bone-piercing chill.</p><p>Bing Qing held up the statue and let it float in the air. Her hands formed a mysterious seal, and runes entered the statue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The statue began to shake and emit a bright light. The bone-piercing chill became even stronger. Many people shivered and used their martial arts to resist it.</p><p>The light screen on the statue seemed to resonate with the light screen. The light screen trembled slightly, and a vortex appeared on the light screen.</p><p>“Quick, go in!”</p><p>Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Paragon rushed into the vortex first, followed by Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>In the end, only Bing Qing was left.</p><p>Bing Qing grabbed the statue and rushed into the whirlpool, and the whirlpool slowly disappeared.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed into the vortex, he appeared on a mountain peak. To be more precise, it was an Ice Mountain.</p><p>He looked around and found an hai and the others beside him.</p><p>“It’s so cold!”</p><p>Someone shuddered and his voice trembled.</p><p>The temperature of this world was shockingly low. Even a true G.o.d Realm expert would feel a bone-chilling cold when a gust of cold wind blew over. They would have to use their divine power to resist it.</p><p>Everyone looked into the distance, and what they saw was a patch of white.</p><p>The snow was white, and the snow-white icebergs stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had cultivated the divine power of frost. This kind of environment did not affect him at all. On the contrary, he felt very comfortable.</p><p>He activated the divine power of extreme cold. Between heaven and earth, wisps of cold air gathered towards him and were refined into the divine power of extreme cold.</p><p>Cultivating in this place, those who cultivated cold attribute divine power would cultivate much faster.</p><p>ninth young lord, where is the icy jade heart that you’re looking for? this world seems to be very big!</p><p>Someone asked Bing Qing.</p><p>“I have a map here.”</p><p>An ice jade talisman appeared in Bing Qing’s hand. She injected some divine power into it, and the Jade talisman lit up. A map appeared in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
