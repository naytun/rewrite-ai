My cousin is the saintess of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Yue Linglong said with a smile.</p><p>“Holy maiden!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was really shocked.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had a total of five Saint sons and two saintesses, and they were all qualified to compete for the position of sect leader.</p><p>He did not expect Ouyang Qingxiang to be one of the two saintesses.</p><p>“Holy Virgin Ouyang, it’s an honor to meet you!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and greeted him.</p><p>“I’ve heard about you for a long time, Lu Ming. You entered the Kong Xuan sect as the top disciple of the Qin Tian thirteen clans. When you first entered the Kong Xuan sect, you were only at the demiG.o.d realm. However, in just a few decades, you entered the true G.o.d Realm and became an inner sect disciple. Such a cultivation speed is truly shocking.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang smiled.</p><p>“I was just lucky, just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said a few humble words and changed the topic.”I wonder why Holy Virgin Ouyang has come to find me?”</p><p>“I won’t beat around the bush. I’m here to invite you to join my faction. How about it?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“As expected …”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips slightly. Indeed, Ouyang Qingxiang had come to invite him to join her faction.</p><p>However, Ouyang Qingxiang, the saintess, had come personally. Her sincerity was not bad.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming had no intention of joining any sect. He did not want to listen to anyone’s orders.</p><p>“Holy Virgin Ouyang, I’m sorry to disappoint you. I don’t plan to join any faction at the moment.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You don’t want to join? Lu Ming, you have to consider it carefully.”</p><p>The Ouyang Holy maiden was stunned. She did not expect that Lu Ming would reject her when she personally came to invite him.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming, you should consider it carefully. My cousin is such a beautiful woman and she’s single!</p><p>Yue Linglong said softly and winked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose speechlessly and shook his head. “I appreciate your kind intentions, Holy Virgin Ouyang. However, I really have no intention of joining any faction.”</p><p>“Little brat, don’t be ungrateful. The saintess has already given you a lot of face by personally coming to invite you, yet you still refuse time and time again. You really don’t know what’s good for you.”</p><p>“That’s right. This kid, doesn’t he know the situation he’s in? the Tian Hong sect and the floating light sect both want to kill you. Do you know that our Holy maiden is taking the risk of falling out with the Tian Hong sect and the floating light sect by inviting you? do you understand?”</p><p>The two young men behind Ouyang Qingxiang couldn’t hold it in any longer and started to berate her.</p><p>“You two, shut up!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang scolded the two young men and made them shut up obediently.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you don’t want to agree, I won’t make things difficult for you. I’ll take my leave now.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang cupped her hands.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming suddenly called out to Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes lit up. She thought that Lu Ming had changed his mind.</p><p>“Holy Virgin Ouyang, although Lu Ming has no intention of joining your faction, it’s still possible for us to work together.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Cooperation?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was slightly taken aback.</p><p>that’s right, cooperation. We’ll cooperate!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded again.</p><p>“Kid!”</p><p>The two young men behind Ouyang Qingxiang couldn’t hold it in any longer. One of them shouted, ” “Brat, Who Do You Think You Are? how dare you talk about cooperating with the Holy maiden? Do you really think you’re the number one figure?”</p><p>“That’s right. Our saintess controls a faction, countless experts, and countless resources. What are you? What qualifications do you have to cooperate with our Holy maiden? Why don’t you take a p.i.s.s and look at the reflection? ridiculous, simply ridiculous.”</p><p>The two young men looked at Lu Ming with disdain and contempt.</p><p>“You two, stop talking.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang glanced at the two young men in dissatisfaction.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered with the two young men. He looked at Ouyang Qingxiang and said, ” “Holy Virgin Ouyang, you have to consider this carefully!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm and full of confidence.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was in deep thought.</p><p>But the two young men couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>how arrogant! I’d like to see what qualifications you have to be so confident. What qualifications do you have to talk about cooperation with the Saint? ”</p><p>A young man roared and stepped forward, a powerful aura erupting from his body. He raised his hand, and the thick divine power condensed into a huge hand, which pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes flickered but she did not stop him. She also wanted to see how strong Lu Ming’s combat strength was.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng wanted to stop it, but it was too late.</p><p>Stage seven true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>This young man’s cultivation was at the seventh stage of true G.o.d Realm and he was a heaven’s favorite with extremely powerful combat strength.</p><p>A huge palm print pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and a stream of finger force, like a Spear’s gleam, attacked the palm print.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The palm print was directly penetrated by the finger force and collapsed.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to break his move so easily.</p><p>take this! Horned dragon divine seal!</p><p>The young man roared and activated a divine skill to the extreme, blasting it at Lu Ming with great power.</p><p>However, the young man’s cultivation was only at the seventh stage true G.o.d Realm after all. No matter how strong his combat strength was, Lu Ming did not take him seriously.</p><p>“It’s my turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. A long spear appeared and swept out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the young man’s huge seal collided with the spear light, it emitted a dazzling light and then shattered. The spear light did not stop and continued to press down on the young man.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man was sent flying by the spearlight and he coughed up a large amount of blood.</p><p>“This battle strength …”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had completely exceeded her expectations.</p><p>A second stage true G.o.d actually completely crushed a seventh stage true G.o.d heaven’s favorite. This kind of fighting power could be said to be terrifying.</p><p>“This guy has become even stronger.”</p><p>Even though Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng knew how terrifying Lu Ming was, they could not help but sigh.</p><p>The other young man behind Ouyang Qingxiang was almost scared to death. He stared at Lu Ming with a pale face.</p><p>“Do you still want to try?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the young man and said coldly.</p><p>The young man shivered and broke out in a cold sweat. He did not dare to step forward.</p><p>His combat strength was only on par with the young man from before. He would still be crushed by Lu Ming if he went up.</p><p>impressive, impressive. Brother Lu’s combat strength is unrivaled. I’ve seen many geniuses, but I’ve never seen a genius like brother Lu!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang sighed repeatedly.</p><p>“Now, are you qualified to cooperate with the Holy maiden?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Of course you’re qualified. If brother Lu isn’t, who is?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current ability was strong, Ouyang Qingxiang did not take him seriously. What she valued was Lu Ming’s potential.</p><p>Lu Ming was so talented. If he grew up, he would definitely have a place in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>It was not impossible for him to break through to the sky celestial realm and become the eighth Saint of the Kong Xuan sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
