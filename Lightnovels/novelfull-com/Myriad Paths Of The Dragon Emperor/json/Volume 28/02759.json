He was very worried that Mu Lan, Huang Ling, and the rest would be in danger.</p><p>Mu Lan, of course, he knew about Huang Ling’s feelings for him.</p><p>However, the two women were also stubborn people. They must have seen that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was getting higher and higher. They did not want to be left behind too much. Hence, they went out to take risks and train.</p><p>“When did this happen?”</p><p>Qiu Yue also looked anxious. She had never heard of this before.</p><p>about half a year ago. During this period of time, we have been fighting, so we didn’t say anything. We were planning to report to the ancestor of technique after this and let him send experts to search …</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“Which forest did they go to?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s the perpetual night forest,” Long Chen said.</p><p>“The perpetual night forest!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a jade talisman. This jade talisman was a map of true heavenstar.</p><p>Lu Ming had a map of the true heavenstar long ago. He infused his divine power into the Jade talisman and a map appeared in the air. It was the complete map of the true heavenstar.</p><p>“The perpetual night forest is here,”</p><p>Long Chen pointed at a place on the map.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and leaped into the air. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and rushed toward the forest of perpetual night at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The perpetual night forest was a famous place on the true sky Star. There were many wild beasts in this place, but their levels weren’t high. It was suitable for Warriors under the ethereal G.o.d Realm to train and gain experience.</p><p>Huang Ling and Mu Lan had gone missing here for training.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. Divine energy condensed into a kun Peng on the surface of his body. With a flap of its wings, he could travel ninety thousand miles. Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the perpetual night forest.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming dashed into the perpetual night forest. He spread his spiritual sense and scanned the surroundings.</p><p>The perpetual night forest was huge, but with Lu Ming’s speed, he flew back and forth in no time. The wild beasts in the forest felt Lu Ming’s aura and all hid in fear, not daring to show themselves.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had searched the entire perpetual night forest and even the surrounding area, but he could not find any traces of Mu Lan and Huang Ling.</p><p>“How could this be? Could it be that they have already died in the mouths of the wild beasts?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He could not accept this outcome.</p><p>“It won’t, search again!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and continued to search more carefully.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed. He had a discovery.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming dashed down the perpetual night forest and landed beside an ancient altar.</p><p>This altar was indeed very ancient. It was hard to tell what era it was from. It was cast in grey mud and there were ancient runes on it.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming could sense Mu Lan’s and Huang Ling’s auras on the altar.</p><p>“What kind of altar is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully.</p><p>stop looking. This is a teleportation platform.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the voice of the quant.i.ty formula sounded.</p><p>“A teleportation formation? How come it’s like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. It was not like he had not seen a teleportation platform before. The current teleportation platform was not like this. Moreover, it was cast with grey mud and it looked too simple.</p><p>“It’s normal that you don’t recognize it. This is a very ancient teleportation platform. It could even be said to be one of the earliest teleportation platforms. These teleportation platforms are very rare nowadays. Furthermore, this teleportation platform is already damaged.”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“It’s damaged?”</p><p>“That’s right. If I’m not wrong, your two friends must have been teleported away from this teleportation platform.”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming felt slightly more at ease when he heard this. Mu Lan and Feng Ling had only been teleported away, which meant that they were still alive.</p><p>“Do you know where this transportation formation leads to? Also, can this platform be repaired?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“It can’t be repaired. In the world today, there are only a few people who can repair this kind of ancient platform. Furthermore, it’s very difficult to know where they were transported to. There’s a high possibility that they’ve stepped on an ancient path of stars.”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“The ancient path of stars?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“The ancient path of stars was created by the ancestors of the primal universe. I wonder where it leads to? Whoever steps on it may encounter great danger, but it’s also possible for them to obtain great fortune. Everything depends on their own fortune.”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh. He was helpless.</p><p>Everything would depend on Mu Lan, Huang Ling, and the others ‘own luck. There was nothing he could do to help.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the righteous Army Headquarters with a heavy heart. He told Qiu Yue, Long Chen, and the rest about what had happened. Long Chen and the rest sighed. They did not expect to encounter such a situation.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming sat in the righteous sky Army Headquarters and guided Lu shenhuang, Qiu Yue, and his disciples in their cultivation.</p><p>His few disciples, Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli, had also made rapid progress in their cultivation and displayed great talent.</p><p>In fact, those who could rise up in small chiliocosm were all talented. Once they came to the primal universe, they would explode.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to bring Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the rest to the Kong Xuan sect to cultivate after he had established himself there. With good resources, their cultivation would progress faster.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed.</p><p>In the past month, the righteous Army had already gained complete control of the territories of the serene Palace, the Walkabout sect, and the blood red a.s.sociation. They had become a powerful force in the surrounding areas.</p><p>However, in the chaotic astral River, there were nearly 1000 major and minor powers. It was common for a power to be destroyed and a new power to be established. The destruction of a few powers, such as the serene Palace, did not cause too much of a stir.</p><p>A month later, the ancestor of technique returned to the true heavenstar to meet Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re in Kong Xuan sect. I wonder if you’ve seen … See Yuexin?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique asked Lu Ming, his eyes shining with hope.</p><p>“As expected, I asked!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He pondered for a moment and said, ” “Senior, I did see senior Yuexin, but …”</p><p>Lu Ming paused for a moment.</p><p>“But what?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s heart sank as he asked.</p><p>“Senior Yuexin already has a family,”</p><p>Lu Ming told the ancestor of technique everything he knew.</p><p>After the ancestor of technique heard this, he fell silent. After a while, he sighed and said, ” actually, I should’ve expected this. With my talent, how could I be a good match for Yuexin? she’s married. This is good, this is good …</p><p>The ancestor of technique muttered to himself. His eyes were filled with desolation, as if he had aged a lot in an instant.</p><p>“Senior, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with concern. He could understand the ancestor of technique’s feelings. The woman he loved had married someone else. He would definitely not feel good.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique smiled. that’s good. I can manage the righteous Army well in the future. Let’s go, Lu Ming. Let’s go to the underworld star first.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
