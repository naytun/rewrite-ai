Their power was terrifying.</p><p>However, Wu Zifeng’s sword light was more powerful.</p><p>After all, Wu Zifeng was also a top heaven’s favorite. He controlled divine grade divine power and his cultivation had even reached the first stage of true G.o.d.</p><p>Although Lu Ming controlled the ruler’s divine power and cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture at the same time, he had cultivated the other three king-grade divine powers and his divine power was extremely strong.</p><p>In addition, the battle formula tripled his combat power. However, he was only at the 5th level of the void G.o.d Realm. Even if he combined all his advantages, it wouldn’t be enough to make up for the huge gap in cultivation.</p><p>Therefore, the netherdragon beast King was more concerned about Wu Zifeng’s attack.</p><p>It used all its strength to turn its head to avoid its vital parts, and then waved out a sharp claw to grab Wu Zifeng’s long sword.</p><p>However, in this case, his weakness was exposed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. He became one with his sword and the sword radiance stabbed the netherdragon beast King’s neck.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that something was amiss.</p><p>When his combat sword stabbed the nether Dragon beast King’s neck, it did not hit its vital point as he had expected. Instead, it was blocked. Lu Ming felt as if he had stabbed into an iron wall.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out. Then, the nether Dragon beast King’s neck emerged and exploded with a terrifying force. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he was sent flying. He only stopped after flying for more than a hundred miles. He felt his blood and Qi churning in his body, as if his body was about to crack.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t the netherdragon beast King’s neck a vital point? however, when he stabbed the netherdragon beast King’s neck with his sword, he could not Pierce it at all. Not only that, but a terrifying power had also exploded. The power of this power had simply exceeded the netherdragon beast King’s Own strength.</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out at all.</p><p>Could it be that the netherdragon beast King had no vital parts?</p><p>How could they fight then?</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>After being stabbed in the neck by Lu Ming, the nether Dragon beast King seemed to be completely enraged. It roared continuously, and the layer of light on its body became even brighter.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, the nether Dragon beast King roared. It opened its mouth and spat out a beam of light.</p><p>The all-encompa.s.sing net that Yue Linglong had condensed was shattered by this force. Yue Linglong’s delicate body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood. Her body retreated rapidly, her face pale.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King continued to roar, and another pillar of light blasted towards Yue Linglong.</p><p>“Linglong, be careful!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng came to Yue Linglong’s side in time and dodged the light pillar with Yue Linglong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The light beam struck the canyon’s wall, causing it to explode. A huge gap appeared, and the rocks in the gap were turned into ashes.</p><p>Terrifying, what a terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng’s expressions changed.</p><p>The light pillar that the nether Dragon beast King had shot out was shockingly powerful. It was far stronger than the nether Dragon beast King’s Own power, and it was not something they could withstand.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King actually had such a killing move.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King roared continuously, and beams of light shot out of its mouth toward Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and the other two.</p><p>The three of them didn’t dare to take it head-on and could only use their movement techniques to Dodge.</p><p>This Canyon, this piece of land, was blasted into a huge pit, it was a mess.</p><p>The netherdragon beast King was simply invincible.</p><p>Its entire body was impervious to swords and Spears, and its attack power was astonishing. Even if an existence above the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm came, they would most likely not be able to do anything to this netherdragon beast King.</p><p>this kind of attack consumes a lot of energy. We just have to avoid it for a while. When its energy is exhausted, it will die!</p><p>Yue Linglong transmitted her voice.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng nodded. They naturally understood this logic.</p><p>They guessed that the attack of the netherdragon beast King was an explosive attack. It consumed a shocking amount of energy, and the netherdragon beast King would not be able to last long.</p><p>The three of them dodged with all their might. As long as the other party’s energy was exhausted, wouldn’t they be slaughtered?</p><p>Time flew by, and ten minutes pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King had been attacking like this for ten minutes. It had shot out at least a thousand light pillars. However, it showed no signs of stopping, nor did it show any signs of exhaustion.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>The three of them were dumbfounded. This was simply against common sense.</p><p>The energy of the nether Dragon beast King seemed to be endless.</p><p>“This freak, let’s retreat!”</p><p>Yue Linglong was already thinking of retreating.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng were helpless and unwilling to give up. There were still many nether dragon cores at the scene that had not been taken out. If they left just like that, they would suffer a great loss.</p><p>However, in the face of such an abnormal nether Dragon beast King, they could only retreat.</p><p>The three of them gathered and flew in one direction. However, the nether Dragon beast King had no intention of letting them go. It chased after them while roaring. Its mouth was like a machine gun, and it spat out a beam of light with terrifying power.</p><p>The three of them quickly dodged. This way, the netherdragon beast King caught up to them again.</p><p>The three of them had ugly expressions. They wanted to leave, but they couldn’t.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>The three of them quickly thought of countermeasures.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Because at this moment, he felt that the word ‘battle’ in his sea of consciousness was shining slightly, and a strange aura was spreading out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a chill in his eyes. It was because there was a surge of energy in the word ‘battle’ that surged into Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>When the energy surged into Lu Ming’s eyes, he immediately realized that there was something strange about the nether Dragon beast King’s body.</p><p>On the neck of the nether Dragon beast King, there was a bright ball of light that seemed to contain terrifying energy.</p><p>The reason why the nether Dragon beast King was able to continuously shoot out light pillars was because of the energy provided by this ball of light.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming could not see it at all. He could only see it after the energy from the word ‘battle’ surged into his eyes.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s mouth was wide open in shock.</p><p>He had seen that ball of light clearly.</p><p>The source of the ball of light was actually a word. It looked like the word ‘quant.i.ty’, the word’ quant.i.ty ‘for energy.</p><p>Looking at the words, it was very similar to Lu Ming’s ‘battle’.</p><p>“It can’t be, could it be that the ‘quant.i.ty’ word and the ‘battle’ word have the same origin? That’s why the ‘battle’ word in my sea of consciousness reacted!”</p><p>Lu Ming dodged the attacks of the nether Dragon beast King while he pondered.</p><p>At this moment, the ‘battle’ character in his sea of consciousness was becoming more and more resplendent. In the end, it started to shine.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s sharp senses caught the ‘measure’ word on the netherdragon beast King’s neck vibrating. It seemed to have sensed the ‘battle’ word in Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Only Lu Ming could sense all of this. Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng could not see or sense anything.</p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
