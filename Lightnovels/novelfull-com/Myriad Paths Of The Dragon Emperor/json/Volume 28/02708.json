Cultivation indeed needed to be done step by step. This time, he had broken through two levels at once. Even if the quant.i.ty formula still had energy, he could not continue to improve and needed time to stabilize it.</p><p>However, since the ” quant.i.ty ” formula had such a heaven-defying effect, it should not be wasted.</p><p>How should he find a treasure that contained powerful energy for the quant.i.ty formula to absorb? Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>“Brat, even if I don’t have a treasure that contains powerful energy, I can still absorb the energy from the outside world at all times and slowly store it. It’s just that the speed is much slower!”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said again.</p><p>“It can be done like this?” Lu Ming was elated. He sensed carefully and realized that the energy between heaven and earth was slowly gathering towards him and surging into the ” measure ” formula. Although it was slow, it was still very impressive after acc.u.mulating for a long time.</p><p>kid, if you want to acc.u.mulate energy as soon as possible, I can guide you to a place in this secret realm. There is a treasure there. If I absorb and refine it, I guarantee that it will improve your cultivation by a large margin!</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula continued.</p><p>“There’s such a treasure? Where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly, his heart burning with excitement. He had already tasted the sweetness just now and was looking forward to it.</p><p>that place is called the Night Dragon Cave. There is a type of Night Dragon blood jade inside that contains terrifying energy. As long as you get it for me to refine, I’ll transfer the energy to you and your cultivation will soar! the elder said.</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go. I’ll definitely go!”</p><p>Lu Ming made a decision.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>After communicating with the quant.i.ty formula, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh and ended his cultivation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re actually able to break through your cultivation level continuously. You’re really abnormal!”</p><p>When Yue Linglong saw that Lu Ming had ended his cultivation, she immediately cried out in an exaggerated manner.</p><p>I was lucky. I had a fortuitous encounter in the past and acc.u.mulated a wave of energy. Just now, at the critical moment, I also risked my life to burst it out. I didn’t expect that I would be right and my cultivation base would improve.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had explained it this way, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were still very surprised.</p><p>by the way, I know of a place in the dark Dragon secret realm called the Night Dragon Cave. There might be some treasures in there. Should we go there and take a look? ”</p><p>Lu Ming changed his tone.</p><p>“Yes, of course we’re going!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said. She was really curious, and once she heard that there was a treasure, there was no reason for her not to go.</p><p>Of course, there was one more thing they had to do before they left, and that was the netherdragon’s beast core.</p><p>The three of them worked together to collect the nether Dragon’s beast core and left.</p><p>However, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s injuries had not fully recovered, and they had not recovered to their peak. Immediately, the three of them found a hidden place. Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng focused on healing their injuries. After a few days, their injuries were fully recovered, and their cultivation and combat strength had reached their peak.</p><p>At this moment, there were only six days left before the three month deadline.</p><p>Under the guidance of the ” measure ” formula, Lu Ming headed toward Night Dragon Cave.</p><p>Night Dragon Cave was in the depths of the dark Dragon secret realm. As the three of them advanced, there were still dark Dragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers charging at them continuously. They were all attracted by the dark Dragon blood Curse in Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Of course, with Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng’s current combat strength, they could easily kill the nether Dragon beasts and the Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>Just like that, they used three days to reach the vicinity of Night dragon’s cave, which was pointed out by the quant.i.ty formula.</p><p>Along the way, they had also gained a lot. They had killed a large number of netherdragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers and obtained a large number of beast cores and dragon bones. The three of them had divided them equally. The beast cores and dragon bones in Lu Ming’s hands could be exchanged for fifty thousand points.</p><p>He had achieved his initial goal in this trip.</p><p>50,000 points were enough to exchange for the first stage of a Saint-grade divine skill.</p><p>“This is Night Dragon Cave? Lu Ming, could you be mistaken?” Looking at the gurgling lake water in front of her, Yue Linglong was a little stunned.</p><p>At this moment, in front of them was a boundless Lake. Where was the cave?</p><p>“There’s a formation here that affects our senses. Don’t worry, we’ll just move forward!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Of course, the ‘quant.i.ty’ formula had told him this.</p><p>The three of them stepped forward. After walking for a while, they suddenly felt a barrier in front of them, like a layer of bubble.</p><p>don’t use your divine power to block it. The stronger the divine power, the stronger the barrier. We can’t get in. We can get in without using divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming reminded him again.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng nodded. They did not use their divine power to resist and stepped out directly.</p><p>With a pop, the three of them seemed to have pa.s.sed through a layer of bubbles. The next moment, they arrived at a pitch-black pa.s.sage.</p><p>‘This …’</p><p>The three of them were stunned. There was really a big formation here. The ones before were all illusions.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh at the wonder of the big array.</p><p>The more divine power was used, the stronger the barrier would be. When ordinary people encountered such barriers, they would subconsciously use divine power. That way, they would not be able to pa.s.s through at all. Only by not using divine power could they pa.s.s through the great array.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng looked at Lu Ming curiously. In their hearts, Lu Ming was becoming more and more unfathomable.</p><p>“Is Lu Ming really an outer sect disciple who has just joined the sect?” Yue Linglong blinked her big eyes and took a few more glances at Lu Ming. Of course, she was not interested in Lu Ming. She was just curious.</p><p>“We have to be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded them. The three of them concealed their auras and went deeper into the pa.s.sage.</p><p>The pa.s.sage was silent and very long. The three of them walked for thousands of meters before they reached the end of the pa.s.sage, arriving at a huge underground cave.</p><p>The cave was empty except for an altar that attracted their attention.</p><p>The altar was engraved with dense runes that looked like small true dragons that were intertwined.</p><p>At the very top, there was a piece of blood jade. Inside it, there were actually many small Blood Dragons swimming.</p><p>There were also different gemstones of different colors embedded in the other parts of the altar.</p><p>that’s the rainbow divine stone!</p><p>Suddenly, Yue Linglong cried out. Her eyes lit up as she stared at the seven-colored gemstones.</p><p>“Rainbow divine stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled because he had never heard of such a gem.</p><p>it’s really the rainbow divine stone. The rainbow divine stone can be used to refine a kind of healing elixir. It has a powerful healing effect on the divine body. It can even heal the injuries of a divine realm expert. It can be sold for a lot of money!</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Then, his eyes lit up.</p><p>If it could be refined into a healing elixir that was helpful to even sky-G.o.ds, its value would definitely be very high.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the stronger one’s divine body would be. Once injured, it would be harder to recover.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
