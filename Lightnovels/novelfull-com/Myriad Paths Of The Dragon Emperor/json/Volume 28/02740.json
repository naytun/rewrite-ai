In addition to the wild beasts that were chasing them from behind, the few dark ice Race youths were instantly drowned by the group of wild beasts and died in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, the dire beasts that they had attracted had naturally discovered Lu Ming and his group and joined the attack. Lu Ming and his group were surrounded.</p><p>It was obvious that the young men of the dark ice Race had sacrificed themselves to attract the wild beasts and trap them.</p><p>“You guys, look …”</p><p>Someone called out and looked in one direction. In that direction, many figures flickered and rushed to the peak of the mountain. They were all from the dark ice Race.</p><p>They wanted to reach the peak first. Clearly, their goal was also the icy jade frozen heart.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Bing Qing roared, revealing an anxious expression.</p><p>“You guys block them first, I’ll charge up first!”</p><p>let’s go! Bing Qing said and exploded out with all her power, slashing out a terrifying sword light. More than ten desolate beasts were killed in a row. Bing Qing quickly charged forward. She wanted to rush up alone and stop the dark ice Race.</p><p>The ice jade cold heart was of great importance. It was related to the rise of the ice Soul Clan. It could not fall into the hands of the dark ice Clan.</p><p>Bing Qing’s combat strength was amazing, and he quickly opened up a path and gradually broke out of the siege.</p><p>At the same time, another figure from the dark ice Race suddenly changed direction and charged towards Bing Qing.</p><p>When Bing Qing finally broke out of the desolate beasts ‘encirclement, the young man from the dark ice Race had already arrived.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>The young man from the dark ice Clan said coldly as he slashed his saber at Bing Qing. The saber Light was cold and its power was shocking.</p><p>Bing Qing waved her sword to block, and the two of them fought.</p><p>The young man from the dark ice Clan was obviously a peerless heaven’s favorite as well. He was actually evenly matched with Bing Qing.</p><p>As for the other dark ice Race members, they were quickly approaching the peak of the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he cast the ice chain.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An ice chain flew out and whipped at the dire beasts. What happened next surprised Lu Ming. When he swung the ice chain, the dire beasts actually looked frightened. They did not dare to resist and kept retreating.</p><p>“It’s actually like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It was probably because of the ball of cold liquid.</p><p>Lu Ming would not let go of this opportunity. His figure flashed and he rushed out. With a few flashes, he broke out of the encirclement of the dire beasts.</p><p>Bing Qing and Lu Ming continued to rush out, increasing the pressure on the others. They had no choice but to give up on attacking and turn to defense. Only then did they stabilize their position.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and rushed to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming rush out, Bing Qing was overjoyed and called out, ” “Lu Ming, you must stop them from getting the ice jade cold heart. If you can get it, you’ll be a friend of the ice Soul Clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not respond. He kept rushing to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>His main goal was the Cold Moon Stone. Stopping the dark ice Race was secondary.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming charging at them, the dark ice clan’s people’s faces darkened.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the dark ice Race who was fighting with Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>Immediately, two paragons of the dark ice Race rushed toward Lu Ming at an alarming speed. They reached Lu Ming in no time and slashed at him with their cold sabers.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and charged at the other party.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>There were two consecutive explosions. Lu Ming felt a strong surge of energy and his figure retreated slightly.</p><p>“These two people are so powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked. Even if the two of them were not as good as Liu shangkai when they joined forces, they would not be far from him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two dark ice Race members shouted and continued to charge toward Lu Ming, launching violent attacks.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to fight with the other party. He immediately used the ice chain.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>His opponent’s saber struck the ice chains, but was blocked by the ice chains.</p><p>In the next moment, the two young men from the dark ice Clan changed their expressions drastically because they felt a terrifying coldness coming from the ice chains.</p><p>They had also cultivated extreme cold divine power and were naturally not afraid of the cold. But now, this chill made them shiver.</p><p>Moreover, a layer of ice immediately condensed on their sabers and quickly spread to their bodies.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” no! the two of them were shocked, and they immediately exploded with divine power to block the chill.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming controlled the ice chains with all his might and whipped them toward the two of them.</p><p>The two of them tried their best to block, and although they managed to block a few moves, their bodies were slowly frozen, and their movements became slower and slower.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear and stabbed out twice in a row. The two dark ice clan’s paragons were frozen. Even if they wanted to Dodge, it was too late. They were pierced by Lu Ming’s long spear and died on the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past them and headed for the mountain peak.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Bing Qing was overjoyed.</p><p>The young man from the dark ice Race, who was fighting with Bing Qing, had an extremely ugly expression.</p><p>The two dark ice Race youths that Lu Ming had just killed were two of the top geniuses of the dark ice Race. It was a great loss for them to be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s too late. Even if he rushed over now, he wouldn’t be able to stop them!”</p><p>Shouted the sovereign of the dark ice Clan.</p><p>At this moment, the dark ice race’s prodigy was almost at the top of the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed but he was still a step too slow. When he neared the top of the mountain, he saw that there was a huge ice platform on the top of the mountain. The ice platform was glowing and there was a fist-sized stone floating above it.</p><p>The stone was snow-white, like a beautiful jade.</p><p>“Ice jade heart!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It was very likely that this was the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve found the ice jade cold heart. The ice jade cold heart will belong to my clan. My dark ice Clan will definitely rise and destroy the ice Soul Clan. We will become the Overlord of the Qin heaven Starfield!</p><p>The young man of the dark ice Clan was overjoyed.</p><p>Immediately, a few dark ice Race youths pounced towards Bing Yu Han Xin.</p><p>However, in order to obtain the ice jade cold heart, one must first step onto the ice platform.</p><p>The ice platform was huge. It was round and had a diameter of 1000 meters.</p><p>A shocking scene happened. The moment the dark ice clan’s paragons stepped onto the ice platform, their bodies suddenly froze. Then, a layer of ice crystals appeared on their bodies and covered them in an instant.</p><p>The dark ice clan’s young men were frozen like statues. They didn’t move, but they were still in shock.</p><p>The remaining paragons of the dark ice Race gasped and stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming flashed a few times and appeared on the other side of the ice platform. He stopped and did not rush forward.</p><p>That ice platform obviously contained a terrifying chill. As soon as people stepped on it, they would be frozen.</p><p>Those few dark ice Race youths were also considered experts. Two of them were even at the fourth stage true G.o.d Realm and weren’t any weaker than an hai. However, they couldn’t resist for more than a few seconds before being frozen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
