Now, you two will leave with this old man. Once we arrive at my residence, I’ll spread the news that I’ve already saved Xing ‘er. Little brother, you should change your appearance so that this old man can take you away.”</p><p>Gu Bo said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. At this moment, he could only choose to believe in Gu Bo.</p><p>Moreover, with Gu Bo’s cultivation, there was no need to lie to him. He didn’t have a hostage in his hands right now, so if Gu Bo wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as turning his hand.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming changed his appearance, changed his clothes, and flew out with Gu Bo.</p><p>Not long after, a group of people flew over from the front. When they saw Gu Xing, they were instantly overjoyed.</p><p>“Third miss, you’re alright?”</p><p>Someone revealed a look of joy.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve already saved third miss.”</p><p>Gu Bo said.</p><p>“Senior elder, I wonder how that foreign kid is doing?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“That brat has already been killed by me. There’s no corpse left. You can rest a.s.sured.”</p><p>Gu Bo said.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>The group of people nodded. However, when they glanced at Lu Ming, they still had a suspicious look on their faces.</p><p>However, in front of Gu Bo, they didn’t dare to be impudent.</p><p>Gu Bo was one of the few remaining elders in the clan of the ancient G.o.d’s descendants, and his seniority was frighteningly high.</p><p>This group of people cast a glance at Lu Ming and left one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Gu Bo and arrived at Gu Bo’s residence without any danger.</p><p>For the rest of the time, Lu Ming stayed here while Gu Bo secretly contacted the experts he could trust. After a month, he would stop the clan leader of the descendants of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>As for Gu Xing, she was obviously distracted.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed.</p><p>That day was the day the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds would worship their ancestors. The location was the gathering of the eight valleys, the place where ancient G.o.d flowers were planted. That place was the Holy Land of the ancient G.o.d clan.</p><p>The gathering place of the eight valleys was filled with people.</p><p>Most of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had come and gathered at the gathering place of the eight valleys.</p><p>On the northern cliff, there was a group of people standing.</p><p>The leader was a middle-aged burly man with a square face and a dignified expression. He was the clan leader of the ancient G.o.d descendants, Gu Xing’s father, Gu Xiong.</p><p>Beside Gu Xiong stood the Grand Elder and some other elders.</p><p>“Let’s start the ancestral worship!”</p><p>Gu Xiong’s voice reverberated across the entire place.</p><p>“Welcome to the ancestral altar.”</p><p>All the ancient G.o.d clansmen shouted in unison.</p><p>Then, eight burly men carrying an altar flew over.</p><p>With every step they took, there would be a m.u.f.fled sound in the void, as if they were carrying a divine mountain while walking.</p><p>This altar was ancient and filled with the feeling of time. It was the ancestral altar of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>When the eight brawny men carried the altar to the place where the eight valleys gathered, the altar emitted a brilliant light. Runes appeared on it, then flew into the void and began to expand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Gu Xiong’s body flickered as he flew to the top of the altar and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>All the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds bowed to Gu Xiong.</p><p>today, after today, I will rise again. The ancient G.o.d clan will rise again. I hope you don’t blame me. Your sacrifice is worth it.</p><p>Looking at the tens of thousands of descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, Gu Xiong roared in his heart.</p><p>He had been preparing for this day for far too long.</p><p>Today, he was going to condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart and regain the glory of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>“Second elder, fifth elder, you can all go down!”</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiong looked at some people on the cliff.</p><p>Many of them were elders of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>“We’re going down too?”</p><p>The elders were stunned.</p><p>According to the usual practice, the elders could just stand on the cliff and did not need to go down.</p><p>“Not bad, you may all leave.”</p><p>Gu Xiong spoke again with a more serious tone.</p><p>Although the elders were suspicious, they didn’t disobey. They all flew to the bottom of the valley and stood in the sea of ancient G.o.d flowers.</p><p>Of course, not all of the elders flew down. For example, the first elder and a few others stood there without moving.</p><p>It was obvious that these people had known about Gu Xiong’s plan long ago, and they were also Gu Xiong’s supporters.</p><p>“Where’s Xing ‘er? didn’t she come?” Gu Xiong looked at the first elder.</p><p>third miss didn’t come. She has been staying with elder Gu Bo all this time.</p><p>The great elder reported.</p><p>“Oh, really? That’s good!”</p><p>Gu Xiong’s eyes flickered with an indescribable light.</p><p>Actually, at this moment, Gu Xing had already arrived nearby.</p><p>Gu Xing, Lu Ming, Gu Bo, and some of the people that Gu Bo had contacted, came to a secret place in the distance, watching this side from afar.</p><p>“Father, I hope you won’t do anything stupid!”</p><p>Gu Xing’s hands were tightly clenched together. She was extremely nervous.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiong started his speech.</p><p>we, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, are the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. n.o.ble blood flows in our bodies. We should have been the Dominators and Royal families of the primeval universe. But now, we’re hiding on a small star. My fellow clansmen, are you willing to accept this? ”</p><p>Gu Xiong’s voice sounded.</p><p>“I’m unwilling!”</p><p>“I’m unwilling!”</p><p>The descendant of the ancient G.o.d clan shouted. His voice was so loud that it could topple mountains and overturn the seas.</p><p>“I’m also unwilling.”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared, ” I once swore that I would lead our race to glory in this life. For that, I would do anything, including my own life. What about you? are you willing to sacrifice your lives for the glory of our race? ”</p><p>“I’m willing!”</p><p>“I’m willing to sacrifice my life!”</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds roared.</p><p>alright, since you’re all willing, then today will be the day you sacrifice yourselves to bring success to our tribe. Activate the formation!</p><p>Gu Xiong shouted. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>The Grand Elder and the others also shouted.</p><p>&Nbsp; the walls and the ground of the eight valleys congregated in endless runes, creating a light barrier that completely enveloped all the ancient G.o.d descendants.</p><p>“This is … What’s going on?”</p><p>“Chief, what are you doing?”</p><p>Many descendants of the ancient G.o.ds felt that something was wrong and immediately shouted.</p><p>But the next moment, a scream was heard.</p><p>&Nbsp; a ball of blood-colored mist appeared and covered one of the ancient G.o.d descendants. This descendant’s cultivation wasn’t high, so his flesh and blood were quickly corroded and turned into a pool of blood.</p><p>“Ah, what’s going on?”</p><p>“Chief, what are you doing?”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>“Father …”</p><p>In the distance, Gu Xing suddenly collapsed onto the ground, as if she had been drained of all her strength. Her eyes were filled with disappointment.</p><p>“As expected, as expected. Rush out and stop them. Remember, close the formation first.”</p><p>Gu Bo roared and charged out first.</p><p>The others followed Gu Bo and flew out. Lu Ming mixed in with the crowd and flew out together.</p><p>“Your sacrifice will bring glory to our clan. Rest in peace!”</p><p>Gu Xiong’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>ah, animal, you animal. You want to sacrifice us for your own benefit.</p><p>Some elders finally saw through Gu Xiong’s evil intentions and immediately shouted out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
