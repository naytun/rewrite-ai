Of course, they were only ordinary first stage true G.o.d Realm experts and couldn’t be compared to the winged demon and the others.</p><p>However, the nine ice chains made a creaking sound as if they could not hold on any longer.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the ice chains, trying to strangle the nine dire beasts. However, as the dire beasts struggled, the creaking sound of the ice chains grew louder and louder. Finally, with a bang, the nine chains exploded.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The nine wild beasts roared as they charged at Lu Ming. Lu Ming took out a long spear and stabbed nine times in a row, killing the nine wild beasts.</p><p>sigh, it seems that if I want to cultivate the ice chain to its strongest power, it’s far from enough to rely on the divine power of the ultimate cold!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>According to what was recorded in the ice shackles, if one wanted to cultivate it to completion and unleash the full power of the ice shackles, they would need some special materials.</p><p>Without these materials, the ice chains would be like having no foundation. They would break with a single strike and would not be able to unleash their full power.</p><p>According to the secret technique, the best material to cultivate the ice shackles was the Cold Moon Stone. The cold Qi contained in the Cold Moon Stone could allow the cultivation of the ice shackles to reach large success.</p><p>Lu Ming left the cultivation place and went to the library. After reading a large number of books, he found out that the cold Moonstone was very rare and precious. It was almost extinct in the Qin heaven Galaxy and only the ice Soul Clan had it.</p><p>However, the ice Soul Clan was one of the most powerful clans in the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>There were many races in the Qin heaven Starfield, but there were only two strongest. One of them was the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was stronger than the Kong Xuan sect and any of the three Overlord forces. Only a few forces working together could compete with the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s strength was evident.</p><p>The Cold Moon Stone was an extremely precious treasure of the ice Soul Clan. It was not easy to get it.</p><p>it seems that I can only put the ice chain aside for now. I’ll go to the ice Soul Clan and find some Cold Moon Stones when I improve my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then returned to the place where he cultivated the divine skill, focusing on it.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time. Spring pa.s.sed and autumn came. In the blink of an eye, twenty years had pa.s.sed.</p><p>In the past twenty years, Lu Ming had devoted himself to practicing various divine skills and had made great progress.</p><p>The nine stage Crimson Gold armor had reached the third stage, and the three apocalyptic strikes had also broken through to the third stage. As for the speed-type divine skill, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, Lu Ming had cultivated it to the second stage.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming’s cultivation base was rising steadily and was slowly approaching the peak of eighth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>One should know that at high-tier virtual G.o.d-level, it would take tens of thousands of years to advance each level. It was already very good that Lu Ming could advance his cultivation to peak eighth-tier virtual G.o.d-level in twenty years.</p><p>Also, the probability of triggering the battle formula’s tripled combat power had also increased to a quarter.</p><p>Out of the four times it was triggered, one would succeed.</p><p>my cultivation has already reached the peak of the 7th level of the void G.o.d Realm. Why don’t I try to break through to the 8th level in one go? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and went to the divine pulse tower to break through to the next realm.</p><p>A few months later, Lu Ming succeeded as expected. His cultivation had reached 8th tier void G.o.d Realm, and his combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied. He consolidated his cultivation for a few more days before he walked out of the divine pulse tower.</p><p>As soon as he walked out of the divine pulse tower, Lu Ming saw a familiar person. It was the outer sect elder, Huo Quan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve been waiting for you for a few days. If you don’t come out in a few days, I’ll have to go in and call you!”</p><p>Huo Quan said with a smile.</p><p>Obviously, Huo Quan had found out from the guards of the divine pulse tower that he was cultivating in the divine pulse tower. This was not difficult to find out.</p><p>“Is there something you need, elder Huo?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s not me, it’s the sect master. The sect master has something for you to do.”</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>“The Dragon boats mountain finally has something to ask me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>It had been a few decades since the Dragon boats ‘mountain cast the dark Dragon blood Curse on him. The Dragon boats had never looked for Lu Ming in the past few decades, but Lu Ming knew that it was only a matter of time before the Dragon boats came looking for him.</p><p>“Sect master, what is it that you want to talk to me about?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m asking you to complete a mission related to the ice Soul Clan. You’re not going alone this time. Some people will go with you. You’ll be rewarded with 20000 points each if you complete the mission.</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>“I’m going to the ice Soul Clan for a mission!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>What a coincidence. Only the ice Soul Clan had the Cold Moon Stone. Lu Ming had planned to visit the ice Soul Clan after his cultivation level was higher, preferably after he had broken through to the true G.o.d-level, but it seemed that he had to go earlier.</p><p>That’s good, I’ll see if I can get some Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>As for the reward of 20000 points, Lu Ming was not particularly concerned. It was just a pa.s.sing thought.</p><p>“How many people from the Kong Xuan sect are coming?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>this time, all the inner disciples are under ten thousand years old. There are nine of them in total. Including you, there are ten of them. Furthermore, you are the team leader this time!</p><p>Huo Quan said. At this point, Huo Quan carefully sized up Lu Ming, his eyes revealing deep shock.</p><p>As an outer sect elder, of course, he knew about Lu Ming’s fight against nine of the top ten virtual G.o.ds in the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>When he first heard about it, he was deeply shocked. His first reaction was disbelief.</p><p>Now, when he saw Lu Ming’s cultivation, he was shocked once again.</p><p>Eighth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>He remembered very clearly that Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at the demiG.o.d realm when he won first place in the thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment. It had only been a few decades, but Lu Ming’s cultivation base had skyrocketed to eighth-level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>no wonder the sect master would personally meet him. He is indeed a monstrous genius. Huo Quan thought to himself.</p><p>“I’m the captain?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He had never thought that he would be the captain this time.</p><p>“That’s right. This is the sect master’s order. Also, this is your team leader’s flag. It represents your authority as a team leader. In this mission, the other nine people will listen to your orders.”</p><p>After saying this, Huo Quan took out a flag that was slightly bigger than his palm.</p><p>The flag was golden in color, as if it was made of gold.</p><p>“Alright then!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded speechlessly, took the flag and kept it.</p><p>“Come with me. The others have been waiting for you for two days.”</p><p>Huo Quan smiled and turned to fly in one direction. Lu Ming followed him.</p><p>……</p><p>Nine young men were waiting in an open s.p.a.ce in the inner court.</p><p>These nine people, there were both men and women. They all looked very young, under ten thousand years of age. Moreover, they were all inner sect disciples with true G.o.d Realm cultivation base.</p><p>To be able to break through to the true G.o.d Realm under ten thousand years, without a doubt, they were all Dragons among men, people with outstanding talent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
