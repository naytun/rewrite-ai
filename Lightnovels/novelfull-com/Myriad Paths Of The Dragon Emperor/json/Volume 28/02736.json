Then, more and more cracks appeared, and finally, the cracks were like a dense spider web.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A moment later, the storage ring exploded into pieces like a piece of ice, and the liquid reappeared in the lake, exuding a shocking chill.</p><p>The storage ring was frozen and shattered. Lu Ming was at a loss for words.</p><p>Fortunately, there was nothing else in the storage ring. Lu Ming was afraid that other things would be frozen by the liquid. Therefore, he took an empty storage ring to store the liquid. He did not expect that even the storage ring could not store the liquid.</p><p>kid, such a treasure usually needs to be stored in a corresponding tool or sealed before it can be taken away. You can’t take it away with a storage ring.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the voice of the quant.i.ty formula sounded.</p><p>“Old Liang, do you know any sealing techniques? can you teach me one or two?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I don’t understand!” The ” quant.i.ty ” formula replied, causing Lu Ming to roll his eyes.</p><p>“Could it be that I can’t take this treasure with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. He felt extremely upset.</p><p>This ball of liquid was definitely a rare treasure. It would be strange if he didn’t feel bad after encountering a treasure and not being able to take it away.</p><p>that might not be the case. Didn’t you cultivate an ice attribute secret technique? you can directly refine this liquid and make it a part of your secret technique. Not only can you take it away, but it can also transform your secret technique and give it shocking power.</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had originally come here to find a Cold Moon Stone to cultivate the cold ice chain, but other cold-attribute treasures might be able to replace the Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>If he used this liquid to cultivate, he might be able to greatly increase the power of the ice shackles.</p><p>“Then let’s start!”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with antic.i.p.ation. He immediately activated the ice chain secret skill and nine ice chains extended from his body.</p><p>kid, wait a moment. Rather than cultivating nine chains, why don’t you cultivate one? put more focus on cultivating one ice chain in this liquid. That way, you can truly display the power of this liquid. If you cultivate nine chains, the power will be less powerful.</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula reminded him again.</p><p>“That’s reasonable.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. With a thought, he kept the other eight ice chains, leaving only one remaining. That ice chain wrapped around the ball of liquid.</p><p>As soon as it wrapped around the ball of liquid, the ice chain made a cracking sound, as if it was about to be frozen.</p><p>The ice chains were originally extremely cold, but at this moment, they were about to be frozen. One could see how cold the liquid was. Moreover, there was a shocking chill that rushed into Lu Ming’s body through the ice chains.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly circulated his G.o.d’s power and the divine power of frost to resist it. Then, he began to absorb and refine the liquid according to the method of the secret skill, ice chain.</p><p>This was a difficult and slow process. Time pa.s.sed by day by day.</p><p>One day, five days, ten days, a month …</p><p>Lu Ming’s refining took two months.</p><p>During this period of time, Liu shangkai had led the people from the unique demon Academy to block Lu Ming at the entrance of the canyon. However, more than a month had pa.s.sed and Lu Ming had not come out. Liu shangkai thought that Lu Ming had left long ago and had left later on.</p><p>After two months of refining, the ball of liquid was finally completely refined by Lu Ming and it was completely integrated into the ice chain.</p><p>The ice chain seemed to have turned into a physical substance. It was bone-chilling and emitted a terrifying chill.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely satisfied. The power of this ice chain was very shocking. It could be Lu Ming’s trump card. Once used, it could catch the opponent off guard and freeze them.</p><p>Satisfied, Lu Ming kept the ice chain. The ice chain retracted into Lu Ming’s body and disappeared.</p><p>It had already been refined. Naturally, it had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s been two months. I have to hurry to the central area.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and left the valley, heading towards the central area.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming was also looking for the Cold Moon Stone. Unfortunately, he did not find any traces of the Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming finally neared his destination after half a month.</p><p>In the central area, there was a huge Ice Mountain. This Ice Mountain was hundreds of thousands of meters high and pierced into the sky.</p><p>This was the destination of their trip.</p><p>The ice jade cold heart that the ice Soul Clan was looking for was on this Ice Mountain.</p><p>However, this Ice Mountain was not easy to climb. There was a terrifying restriction here that made it impossible to fly. One could only climb up along the mountain. However, there were many powerful desolate beasts guarding the mountain.</p><p>The ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing, and many other members of the ice Soul Clan had arrived.</p><p>In addition, Liu shangkai and the others had also arrived.</p><p>They didn’t go up immediately. Instead, they were waiting for everyone to gather their strongest power and then go up together.</p><p>“Someone’s here again.”</p><p>Suddenly, someone looked in one direction.</p><p>Nine figures flew over from the other side.</p><p>These nine people were Kong Xuan sect’s an hai and the others.</p><p>After a few months of trekking, they had finally arrived at this place.</p><p>“The Kong Xuan sect.”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s eyes turned cold as soon as he saw the people from the Kong Xuan sect. His body moved, and he charged toward an hai and the others. His powerful aura was like a mountain, pressing down on an hai and the others.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bodies of an hai and the others trembled violently as they retreated. Some of the weaker cultivators even spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Liu shangkai, what are you doing?”</p><p>An hai was furious.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Liu shangkai sneered, his cold killing intent spreading, making the surrounding air even colder.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other disciples of the unique demon Academy flashed and surrounded an hai and his group.</p><p>The faces of an hai and the others turned pale.</p><p>“Where’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>Liu shangkai asked coldly.</p><p>“I don’t know. We were separated from him a long time ago.”</p><p>The long-faced young man replied.</p><p>“Lost? Alright, since that kid isn’t here, I’ll take your lives in exchange.”</p><p>Liu shangkai said ferociously. The black patterns on his face glowed, and he was about to kill an hai and the others.</p><p>The expressions of an hai and the others changed drastically. The nine of them gathered together and set up layers of defense.</p><p>brother Liu, wait a moment!?</p><p>At this moment, Bing Qing spoke and walked over.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, are you going to stop me?”</p><p>Liu shangkai looked at Bing Qing.</p><p>the ice Soul Clan has invited you here to retrieve the ice jade cold heart. Since we haven’t gotten it yet, I must make sure that we gather the strongest forces we can. If you have any grudges, you can settle them after we get the ice jade cold heart. I won’t stop you then!</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>His meaning was clear: I need everyone’s strength to get the heart of the frozen Jade. After I get it, you can fight however you want.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
