Apparently, he wasn’t an ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. He had already broken through to the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>This was normal as some of the people who were ranked higher on the virtual G.o.d ranking list had already reached the limit of virtual G.o.d-level and could have broken through to true G.o.d-level a long time ago.</p><p>However, for the sake of the dark Dragon secret realm that only opened once every 100000 years, they had all suppressed their cultivation. Once they entered the dark Dragon secret realm, these people would all be able to break through.</p><p>Kuang Dao was such a person.</p><p>“This is terrible!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s faces also changed greatly.</p><p>Maniac was a top genius. After breaking through to the true G.o.d Realm, his battle strength would be even more shocking.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, are you feeling despair now? the three of you will be the ones to die today!”</p><p>Kuang Dao laughed and his violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming. He wanted to see Lu Ming’s expression of despair and even see Lu Ming begging for mercy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was destined to be disappointed!</p><p>Lu Ming merely frowned slightly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was rapidly thinking of countermeasures.</p><p>you’re pretending to be calm. I want you to kneel in front of me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression made kuangdao very unhappy. He took a step forward and the void trembled. Then, he threw a punch.</p><p>A fist force as huge as a mountain came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a long spear, which was a level one middle-grade divine artifact, and thrust it forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear struck the fist force and a loud boom erupted. Then, the spear ray collapsed and Lu Ming was sent flying by the powerful force, sliding thousands of meters away.</p><p>“Hmph, now you still want to resist me, you don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>Kuang Dao coldly snorted.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the true G.o.d-level, his confidence had increased greatly. Even if Lu Ming was not injured, he was confident that he could suppress Lu Ming, let alone Lu Ming who was seriously injured.</p><p>Back then, he had been injured by Lu Ming and had to escape, leaving LAN Shang and Huang Chengan behind. This was a great humiliation to him.</p><p>Back then, he had been injured by Lu Ming and had to escape, leaving LAN Shang and Huang Chengan behind. This was a great humiliation to him.</p><p>Today, he would make Lu Ming pay ten times the price.</p><p>d.a.m.n it, my physical body is too injured. I can’t even activate the double combat power, let alone the triple combat power.</p><p>Lu Ming steadied his body. Many thoughts ran through his mind as he thought of countermeasures.</p><p>Previously, in order to deal with the netherdragon beast King, Lu Ming had been hit by its energy. His physical body had been severely injured and he could not even withstand the double combat strength.</p><p>This was because triggering a double or even triple combat power required a very high physical body. If one’s physical body was not strong enough, they would not be able to withstand it and would be torn apart by the powerful force.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s physical body was injured, he could not hold on either.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were both very anxious. Unfortunately, their injuries were more serious and they could not help at all.</p><p>kid, don’t panic. There’s still some energy in my body. I’ll transfer it into your body now. Not only will it heal your injuries quickly, but it’ll also help you break through in a short time!</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>of course it’s true. I find you pleasing to the eye, but I’m determined to cultivate you into a strong expert. How can I let you fall just like that? kid, pay attention!</p><p>As soon as the ” measure ” formula was spoken, Lu Ming felt a surge of energy emerging from the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>This energy was extremely pure, as if it had no impurities and could be easily refined.</p><p>“Refine, refine …”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture at full force to refine this energy.</p><p>In an instant, large ma.s.ses of energy were refined and seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s injuries were recovering at an alarming rate.</p><p>In his body, the four divine flames, which had been somewhat exhausted, were also burning fiercely and growing stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura suddenly became stronger.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Kuangdao also felt it and his eyes focused.</p><p>“This kid is evil, let’s cripple him first!”</p><p>Kuang Dao didn’t waste any more time and immediately attacked. His fist force was like a mountain as it rumbled towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled continuously. At this moment, Lu Ming had activated the double combat power. A ray of spear light shot up and collided with the fist force of the Mad path.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming blocked Kuang Dao’s fist force.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Kuangdao, even if you’ve broken through, your combat strength is only so-so!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like stars. His aura became higher and higher, and soon, it reached its peak.</p><p>“This kid … Die!”</p><p>Kuang Dao was shocked and then furious. His Shen power boiled and he used a Shen technique.</p><p>“Tyrannical divine fist!”</p><p>Kuang Dao punched out with both of his fists continuously. The fist force was like a falling comet. It was much more terrifying than when he was at the virtual G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current combat strength was much stronger than before.</p><p>The《three apocalyptic strikes》had already broken through to the second stage.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, air blast.</p><p>The Spear’s radiance burst forth and shot up against the sky, continuously bombarding Kuang Dao’s fist force. However, the fist force was destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure rapidly approached Kuang Dao. Suddenly, Lu Ming’s spear momentum changed and became more powerful.</p><p>The battle formula tripled his combat power, activated!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out. The Spear’s gleam was as huge as a mountain, bringing with it a shocking power.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s current peak combat strength. This level of combat strength made Kuang Dao’s pupils contract.</p><p>Kuang Dao didn’t hesitate to use the secret skill to increase his combat strength. His combat strength instantly doubled.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them raised their combat strength to the extreme and continued to exchange blows in the air. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>To be honest, mad Dao was very powerful. He was already fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Now that he had broken through to the first stage of true G.o.d Realm, his combat strength had increased by a huge amount. He was definitely not comparable to an ordinary first stage true G.o.d.</p><p>One should know that when kuangdao was at the ninth stage of the ethereal G.o.d Realm, he could already defeat a first stage true G.o.d. Now that he had broken through to the true G.o.d Realm, he could even kill a second stage true G.o.d, let alone a first stage true G.o.d.</p><p>Defeating and killing were two different concepts.</p><p>Therefore, after the battle, Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage and was being suppressed.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, hurry …”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were also extremely anxious. They were trying their best to refine the divine healing pill, trying to recover some strength as soon as possible.</p><p>As long as the two of them recovered some of their strength, they would not have to fear Kuang Dao.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to h.e.l.l, go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared. At this moment, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were much stronger than the last time they had fought. He was only at fifth-level void G.o.d Realm and he was so powerful. It was simply unheard of.</p><p>He had thought that he would be able to suppress Lu Ming easily after he had broken through to true G.o.d-level, but the truth was not so.</p><p>Of course, he did not know that Lu Ming did not have the time to double his combat power when they fought the last time. Moreover, Lu Ming was only at the first stage of the ” three apocalyptic strikes “. Now that he was going all out, his combat power was far from what it was before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
