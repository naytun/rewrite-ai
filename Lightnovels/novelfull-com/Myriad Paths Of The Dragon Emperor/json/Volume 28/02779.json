Just kill him. It’s too easy on him. I want to throw him into the formation and watch him die miserably as his flesh and blood are melted by the formation,”</p><p>The great elder shouted, his eyes extremely ferocious.</p><p>His son had died in the formation because of Lu Ming. His flesh and blood had been melted. He wanted Lu Ming to die in the formation too. Only then could he vent the hatred in his heart.</p><p>“Alright, then send him into the formation.”</p><p>Gu Xiong nodded. He waved his hand and a powerful force gushed out. Lu Ming was pushed by this force and flew into the formation.</p><p>“He’s back!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He gathered his divine power to resist the blood-red mist outside.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, because of the battle outside, no one activated the array, so it operated rather slowly. The mist wasn’t thick, so the number of ancient G.o.d descendants that had fallen was not particularly high.</p><p>After sending Lu Ming into the formation, Gu Xiong attacked the others.</p><p>The rest of the people couldn’t resist Gu Xiong at all. They were all suppressed by Gu Xiong and sent into the formation one by one.</p><p>Since they wanted to resist him, they should all turn into blood to nourish the ancient G.o.d flower and help him obtain the heart of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Gu Bo’s men were all wiped out. Gu Xing was under Gu Bo’s control and couldn’t move at all, her face full of disappointment and anxiety.</p><p>And at this moment, Gu Bo himself was also in danger.</p><p>Under the siege of two experts of the same level, he was completely outmatched. He was already injured and couldn’t hold on for much longer.</p><p>“Gu Bo, let’s go in together!”</p><p>Gu Xiong said coldly as he personally charged towards Gu Bo.</p><p>Gu Bo was already no match for him, and with Gu Xiong’s help, it was even more difficult for him to fight back. After a few moves, he was. .h.i.t by Gu Xiong and was seriously injured.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Gu Shang and Gu Ling attacked from the front and back, each striking Gu Bo. Gu Bo’s divine body almost exploded, and his injuries became more serious. He had no power to fight back.</p><p>“Gu Bo, go in!”</p><p>Gu Xiong said coldly. His vast divine power suppressed Gu Bo and sent him into the formation.</p><p>In this way, Gu Bo and the others were completely annihilated.</p><p>“Grandpa Gu Bo, father, don’t!”</p><p>Gu Xing shouted.</p><p>shut up. What I’m doing is the great matter of reviving the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. What do you know? ”</p><p>Gu Xiong shouted coldly. With a flash of his body, he returned to the altar.</p><p>“Continue operating the formation!”</p><p>Gu Xiong ordered.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>The first elder and the others appeared on the eight cliffs to control the formation. Within the formation, runes filled the air and were extremely dazzling. The blood-colored mist was rapidly increasing.</p><p>More and more descendants of the ancient G.o.ds began to fall.</p><p>“Ah, Gu Xiong, you’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>“You’ve lost your mind for your own selfish reasons.”</p><p>&Nbsp; many of the ancient G.o.d descendants cursed and swore.</p><p>However, Gu Xiong remained calm and unmoved.</p><p>As the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds continued to fall, their flesh and blood seeped into the ground and were absorbed by the ancient G.o.d flower. The flower became more beautiful and plump.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d flowers that covered the entire mountain gave off a strong fragrance.</p><p>“It’s time!”</p><p>Gu Xiong’s eyes were filled with antic.i.p.ation. He quickly formed a hand seal and runes entered the altar under his feet.</p><p>The altar glowed with a bright light. Lines of runes extended out like tentacles and merged with the array.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the entire place where the eight valleys gathered trembled. Then, all the ancient G.o.d flowers emitted strands of blood-red energy that gathered toward Gu Xiong.</p><p>Gu Xiong was immediately surrounded by a layer of blood-red energy.</p><p>it’s here, it’s here. Hahaha, I’m going to condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Gu Xiong was ecstatic.</p><p>They were called the descendants of ancient G.o.ds, but in fact, the bloodline of ancient G.o.ds in their bodies was extremely thin, and their potential was also very limited.</p><p>However, once he condensed the ancient G.o.d’s heart, it would be different. His potential would be limitless, and his future improvements would be shocking.</p><p>“Sigh, is it still difficult to stop it?”</p><p>Gu Bo heaved a long sigh, full of helplessness.</p><p>“Hahaha, even the heavens are on my side. No, the heavens are on your side, kid …”</p><p>At this moment, in his knowledge sea, bone demon was laughing excitedly.</p><p>“You’re still smiling so happily when we’re almost done for.”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>“Nonsense. Kid, your great opportunity has arrived.”</p><p>Bone laughed.</p><p>“Lucky chance? What kind of opportunity?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>those idiots. If they had killed you outside the formation, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it. However, they acted smart and sent you into the formation. I have a way.</p><p>Bone laughed.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>don’t you have the ‘measure’ formula? you can use it to fight for the ancient G.o.d flower’s energy with the patriarch. If you can attract all the energy, I have a way to make it yours and help you condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“This works too?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“It should be possible. I can attract all the energy from the outside.”</p><p>The voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded.</p><p>then all the members of the ancient G.o.d clan will die? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>there’s no need. As long as the ” measure ” formula absorbs the energy from the outside and fights with the clan leader, the clan leader will suffer a backlash and the formation will stop. Don’t worry, the ancient G.o.d flower’s energy is enough to form the heart of the ancient G.o.d. It’s just that the clan leader is too greedy.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s not delay any further. Let’s begin.”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>“Watch this old lady …”</p><p>The ” measure ” formula was called out and the words emitted a dazzling radiance. Even Lu Ming’s glabella was suffused with a layer of light.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>A terrifying suction force was produced. The energy that was originally gathering toward Gu Xiong suddenly changed its direction and gathered toward Lu Ming. All of it surged into Lu Ming’s glabella and entered the ” measure ” character.</p><p>However, it was not refined this time. After the quant.i.ty formula, it immediately spread out and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Condense …”</p><p>The bone demon made its move. It conjured a strange seal and guided the energy, directing it to Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiong roared furiously.</p><p>Everything had been fine. The energy of the ancient G.o.d flower had been gathering towards him, and he had a feeling that he would be able to form the heart of the ancient G.o.d very soon.</p><p>However, the energy outside suddenly changed direction and gathered toward Lu Ming.</p><p>To his horror, he had already fused with the array. He could not control his body at all. The energy that he had just absorbed and even his own energy gushed out continuously and surged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“That brat, d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, stop!”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared in anger.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>The others were also baffled and couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>“Suck, I’ll suck,. ‘ll suck …”</p><p>The ” measure ” formula absorbed the energy from the outside world with all its might. The energy in the ancient G.o.d flower, including Gu Xiong’s, continuously gathered toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
