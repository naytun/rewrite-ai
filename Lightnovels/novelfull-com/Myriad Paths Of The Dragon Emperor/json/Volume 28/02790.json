Could it be that the Dragon boats mountain had already imparted the ultimate cold Divine Art to Lu Ming?</p><p>Otherwise, they would never believe that Lu Ming could cultivate the ultimate cold divine technique to the peak in just a few decades.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, there were also people who had cultivated the ultimate cold divine technique to its peak and successfully cultivated the ultimate cold divine power. However, it required extremely high talent and a long time.</p><p>However, they didn’t know that Dragon Boat Mountain was also extremely shocked in its heart.</p><p>“This kid can actually control the divine power of extreme cold.”</p><p>Dragon boat’s heart trembled. He knew that the divine power that Lu Ming controlled was a Dominator’s divine power. Now, he was actually using the ultimate cold divine power.</p><p>“Good. The stronger this kid is, the more successful that plan will be.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes flickered.</p><p>On the fighting ring, mo Ying was extremely frightened. He tried his best to burst out, trying to break free from the ice.</p><p>However, would Lu Ming give him such a chance?</p><p>Lu Ming moved and appeared in front of the specter. His cold eyes made the specter shiver and break out in cold sweat.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat …”</p><p>The specter roared madly.</p><p>“Did I allow you to admit defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He thrust his spear forward and killed the specter.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>The specter was dead!</p><p>Huang Wen could not compare to mo Ying. His combat strength was very strong. It was already very obvious during the sect compet.i.tion. However, he had also died at the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was shocking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you are courting death …”</p><p>At that moment, the Tian Hong Saint son was furious. His terrifying aura burst forth and pressed toward Lu Ming. He did not hide his cold killing intent.</p><p>“Tianhong, what are you doing?”</p><p>Nearby, Ouyang Qingxiang also released her aura to block the aura of the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>“What do I want to do? Didn’t you see that the specter had already admitted defeat? He already admitted defeat, and this brat still killed him. He’s simply too audacious. I’ll kill him now!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said angrily.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. Before the battle, they only said that it didn’t matter whether you lived or died. They didn’t say that you can’t kill if you admit defeat.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You, quibble …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was furious. His body was filled with terrifying killing intent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was right. Before the battle, they did say that they would not kill anyone regardless of their life or death. They did not say that they could not kill anyone if they admitted defeat.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, Dragon Boat Mountain waved his sleeves and said, ” it’s true that we didn’t say that we can’t kill if we admit defeat. Let’s explain it now. In the following battles, as long as we admit defeat, we must stop.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son felt helpless when he heard the Dragon Boat Mountain’s words. He could only cast a few cold glances at Lu Ming, and the killing intent in his eyes became even more intense.</p><p>“Saint, let me go and kill this brat!”</p><p>Another young man stepped out from behind the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son nodded and said, ” “Alright, let’s end this quickly. Don’t give that kid the chance to admit defeat.”</p><p>It was obvious that the Tian Hong Saint son was very confident in this young man.</p><p>don’t worry, Saint. He won’t have the chance to admit defeat.</p><p>The young man said coldly. In a flash, he landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Sanguine rain, it’s sanguine rain who’s about to attack!”</p><p>The young man’s arrival on the fighting ring shocked many people.</p><p>That was because sanguine rain was an expert on the real G.o.d ranking list, one of the eight experts on the real G.o.d ranking list in Kong Xuan sect. He was also the strongest person in the real G.o.d Realm under the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>Lu Ming is going to fight with sanguine rain. I wonder what the outcome will be? ”</p><p>if Lu Ming can defeat sanguine rain, it would be a miracle. He would be listed on the true G.o.d ranking list as a stage three true G.o.d.</p><p>that’s right. Sanguine rain is ranked eighty-seventh on the real G.o.d ranking list. However, the strength of his fighting power is not something that mo Ying can compare to.</p><p>Many people were looking forward to this battle. Many of them had already begun to guess the outcome of this battle.</p><p>“An expert on the real G.o.d ranking list? Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Although he had seen the battles between experts on the real G.o.d ranking list before, watching and fighting personally were two different things.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Xue Yu’s figure moved. However, his figure was not charging toward Lu Ming but to the sky.</p><p>In midair, sanguine Rain’s body emitted a blood-red light.</p><p>“Blood rain barrier!”</p><p>Sanguine rain let out a low roar. He pushed with both hands and a layer of blood-red light shield covered the entire fighting ring.</p><p>The sanguine rain barrier was a secret technique that sanguine rain cultivated. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>He used his unique skill the moment he made his move, not giving Lu Ming a chance to retaliate.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Sanguine rain bellowed. In the sanguine rain enchantment, endless sanguine sword gleams suddenly appeared and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“What can a barrier do to me? Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and soared into the sky. Rays of spear radiance burst out from his hands.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the blood-red sword radiance collided with each other continuously, causing a deafening boom.</p><p>“Mm, Why is my divine power so heavily consumed?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He could feel his divine power being rapidly consumed. The same move was consuming his divine power much faster than before.</p><p>hahaha, do you feel that your divine power is rapidly being consumed? under the suppression of my barrier, your divine power will be exhausted after a few moves, and you’ll be at my mercy.</p><p>Sanguine rain laughed triumphantly. Then, more sanguine sword gleams appeared and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>They wanted to exhaust his divine power? You must be joking!</p><p>If it had been anyone else trapped in the blood rain barrier, they would have been in grave danger and their divine power would have been quickly exhausted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the measure formula.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Divine energy kept emerging from the ” quant.i.ty ” formula. Lu Ming’s divine energy was always at its peak.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes. The spear struck down and a crescent-shaped spear ray slashed out.</p><p>Countless blood-red sword lights were destroyed, and the terrifying crescent-shaped spear light slashed toward the blood rain.</p><p>Sanguine Rain’s expression changed. In a flash, he appeared on the other side of the fighting ring, avoiding Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Within the blood rain enchantment, his speed was extremely fast.</p><p>“Such a powerful attack. Let’s see how many moves you can use.”</p><p>Sanguine rain snorted coldly.</p><p>“Is that so? I’ll break your barrier first.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure soared into the sky and blasted towards the barrier.</p><p>“Blood G.o.d Python, kill!”</p><p>The blood rain howled and blood-red pythons appeared in the barrier. There were more than a dozen of them and each of them was hundreds of meters long. They charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to use the moon slash and annihilated a blood-colored Python with one move. However, there were more than ten blood-colored pythons.</p><p>“Hahaha, your divine power is about to be exhausted!”</p><p>b.l.o.o.d.y burst out laughing.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the blood rain and continued to attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
