It could not be broken at all.</p><p>‘</p><p>Miserable shrieks rang out continuously as the blood-colored mist in the array increased. Some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t withstand it at all. Once they were enveloped by the blood-colored mist, only death awaited them.</p><p>At this time, Gu Bo and the others had already arrived.</p><p>Gu Xiong, you have the ambition of a Wolf. You want to condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d by yourself, but you have to sacrifice so many of your clansmen. I will not allow you to do so.</p><p>Gu Bo roared.</p><p>“It’s elder Gu Bo, it’s elder Gu Bo …”</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds that were trapped in the formation were overjoyed when they saw Gu Bo.</p><p>“Gu Bo!”</p><p>Gu Xiong looked at Gu Bo, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Leave Gu Xiong to me. You guys go and close the formation.”</p><p>Gu Bo shouted at the others, and then pounced towards Gu Xiong.</p><p>“You think you can stop me? Naive, kill!”</p><p>Gu Xiong shouted as he flew up into the sky and threw a punch towards Gu Bo.</p><p>Gu Bo didn’t Dodge at all, and also exploded with an attack, blasting out a terrifying move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided with an earth-shattering boom, but the result was a tie.</p><p>As the clan leader of the ancient G.o.d’s descendants, Gu Xiong’s strength was also very shocking. He had reached the third level of the celestial deity realm.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest rushed to the base of the array on the cliff.</p><p>“Don’t even think about closing the formation. Stop them. If they resist, kill them without mercy.”</p><p>The great elder gave the order and soared into the sky, erupting with a terrifying attack.</p><p>Head elder had first level celestial deity cultivation and was extremely terrifying too.</p><p>However, there was also a first level heavenly G.o.d on Lu Ming’s side who charged at first elder. The two sides were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were fighting with the others.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not care about hiding his ident.i.ty. He used all his strength. Nine ice chains flew out and swept toward the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>“It’s you, an outsider!”</p><p>The first elder recognized Lu Ming as soon as he attacked. He let out an angry roar, his eyes filled with ferocity.</p><p>It was because of Lu Ming that he had to watch his son die in the formation. He could not wait to burn Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>“Kill, kill this brat …”</p><p>The great elder roared.</p><p>“Leave this kid to me!”</p><p>An old man charged at Lu Ming, the saber in his hand slashing out rays of saber radiance.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The saber ray struck the ice chains and sent them flying back.</p><p>This elder was an elder of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. His cultivation had reached the peak of true G.o.d and he was astonishingly powerful. He was not any weaker than le Zhong back then. Lu Ming was immediately blocked and he retreated.</p><p>The two sides were locked in battle.</p><p>“Father, stop, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xing also flew over and shouted.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, go to the side. This is none of your business.”</p><p>Gu Xiong shouted.</p><p>father, let’s stop. Those people are all from our clan. There aren’t many people in our clan of ancient G.o.d descendants to begin with. If this continues, I’m afraid we’ll be exterminated.</p><p>Gu Xing shouted.</p><p>nonsense. As long as I can condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart, I will definitely lead my clan to glory. Their sacrifices will be worth it.</p><p>Gu Xiong roared, his eyes filled with madness.</p><p>“Father …”</p><p>Gu Xing’s eyes were filled with disappointment. She gritted her teeth and rushed towards Gu Xiong.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, you …”</p><p>Seeing Gu Xing rushing over, Gu Xiong was slightly startled.</p><p>With such a shock, his attack speed was slightly slower, allowing Gu Bo to seize the opportunity to punch Gu Xiong’s shoulder. Gu Xiong was forced back and coughed out blood.</p><p>“Gu Xiong, close the Grand formation now. Don’t be so stubborn.”</p><p>kill! Gu Bo shouted. At this moment, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were dying in the formation. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Gu Xiong roared.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being ruthless.”</p><p>Gu Bo charged towards Gu Xiong.</p><p>“Humph, Gu Bo, do you think I don’t know that you’ll stop me today? you think you’re being secretive, but I’ve already seen through your plan. Come out.”</p><p>Gu Xiong sneered as he waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, two streaks of light shot out from not far away, flying towards Gu Bo at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The two of them were both old people.</p><p>One was an old man, and the other was an old woman. They both looked as old as Gu Bo.</p><p>“Gu Shang, Gu Ling, it’s you …”</p><p>Gubo was shocked.</p><p>Because these two were existences that were as famous as him. They were the other two elders of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>There were a total of three elders among the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, which were Gu Bo, Gu Shang, and Gu Ling.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Gu Shang and Gu Ling immediately charged towards Gu Bo.</p><p>The cultivation of the two of them was at the third level heavenly deity realm, and their combat strength was not any weaker than Gu Bo’s. With the two of them joining forces, Gu Bo was no match for them at all. He was sent flying with a single move, spitting out blood.</p><p>“Gu Shang, Gu Ling, what are you doing? Even you guys want your a.s.sistants to torture you?”</p><p>Gu Bo roared.</p><p>However, Gu Shang and Gu Ling did not seem to hear him and continued to charge towards Gu Bo. Their attacks were sharp and filled with killing intent.</p><p>hahaha, you don’t have to shout anymore. They’ve been under my control for a long time. They’re completely obedient to me. You can’t stop me today. Hahaha!</p><p>Gu Bo laughed. With a wave of his hand, a wave of G.o.d Power swept out, covering Gu Xing and controlling her.</p><p>At the same time, he moved and charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked.</p><p>The other party suddenly had two third level celestial deity powerhouses charge out. Their strength already completely surpa.s.sed their side. They were absolutely not a match.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated without thinking.</p><p>However, Gu Xiong had already noticed him. He snorted coldly and waved his hand. A huge palm print came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying aura had completely locked onto Lu Ming, making it impossible for him to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give in. He would not sit and wait for death.</p><p>“The three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and burst out with all his strength, turning into a shocking spear radiance and attacking the palm print. At the same time, the nine ice chains stabbed at the palm print like nine silver divine Spears.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a series of explosions, the spear radiance as thick as a mountain range struck the palm print, stirring up violent energy.</p><p>However, Gu Xiong’s palm print was too powerful. It burst out with an abundant amount of energy and Lu Ming’s spear radiance was shattered. Even the nine ice chains were shattered one by one.</p><p>However, the ice chains were only a secret technique. If they were shattered, they could still be reformed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was. .h.i.t by the palm print and fell heavily to the ground. He spat out a large mouthful of blood. Many bones in his body were broken. He had been severely injured.</p><p>“He didn’t die?”</p><p>Gu Xiong was slightly stunned. Although that move just now was a casual move, it was extremely surprising that it didn’t kill a stage one true G.o.d.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
