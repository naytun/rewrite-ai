I’ve finally found a guy who’s quite pleasing to the eye, I can’t let him die like this!”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula kept urging the battle formula.</p><p>I’m looking for it. Cut the c.r.a.p, I can still find it faster!</p><p>The battle symbol art said unhappily.</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula immediately shut up.</p><p>it’s useless, it’s useless. You can’t get out. Stay here and be buried with me. Hahaha!</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing laughed crazily as he tried his best to activate the formation. The formation gave off a bright light. At this moment, it wasn’t just the inside of the cave. The outside of the cave also gave off a bright light.</p><p>In fact, the moment Lu Ming and the rest destroyed the altar, there was a strange sound outside. A beam of light shot into the sky and pierced the sky. It could be seen from far away.</p><p>At the same time, the illusion array that had stopped Lu Ming and the rest from entering had disappeared. The lake was gone and in its place was a tall mountain that rose into the clouds.</p><p>At this moment, the entire mountain peak was shining.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>with such a shocking phenomenon, there must be a treasure. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Everyone who saw the strange phenomenon rushed over.</p><p>In the cave, Lu Ming and the other two were still bombarding the light curtain. However, it was almost useless. The light curtain did not move at all.</p><p>The amount of divine transformation realm corpse water in the cave was increasing. It was almost half full.</p><p>“What do we do? Am I going to die Here today? I don’t want to be drowned by the soul formation corpse water. If I am drowned by the soul formation corpse water, I won’t be able to find my body!”</p><p>Yue Linglong was on the verge of tears. The thought of being drowned by the soul formation corpse water without a corpse left almost scared her to death.</p><p>“Don’t attack yet, save your strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Since he couldn’t blast it open, then he wouldn’t attack. He would wait for the battle character formula to find the formation’s eye, then concentrate all his strength and attack the formation’s eye.</p><p>“Die, die …”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming and the rest could not blast it open, the empty star screamed even more crazily.</p><p>The divine transformation realm corpse water in the cave quickly filled up two-thirds of the cave. The s.p.a.ce that Lu Ming and the other two could move around in became smaller and smaller.</p><p>“I found it. Lu Ming, attack three feet to the left, quick!”</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the battle formula rang in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>attack! Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he shouted, ” attack three feet to the left!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming used all his strength and triggered the tripled combat power of the battle character formula. He circulated his divine energy to the extreme and then cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-piercing!</p><p>A dazzling spear radiance was blasted three feet to the left of the light curtain.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng did not doubt him and also attacked with full force.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three consecutive powerful attacks. .h.i.t the light curtain three feet to the left. The light curtain shook violently, and this time, a crack appeared on the light curtain.</p><p>it’s effective, it’s effective! Continue!</p><p>Yue Linglong was very excited.</p><p>The three of them used their strongest attacks, and more cracks appeared on the light barrier.</p><p>“No, no, impossible, No…”</p><p>Kong Xing roared madly, his face twisted.</p><p>Now, he was only left with a wisp of his soul. It would not be long before this wisp of soul would disappear completely. He was unwilling to give up. He wanted to drag Lu Ming and the other two to die with him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the other two seemed to be on the verge of escaping.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two could not be bothered with the stars in the sky and continued to attack. After a few more moves, the light screen exploded with a bang.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>As soon as the light screen shattered, Lu Ming and the other two did not stop and rushed out of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The empty star roared. The divine transformation realm corpse water rolled and splashed onto the walls of the cave. The walls were corroded and turned into dust.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire mountain peak shook violently and was about to collapse at any moment.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two used their full strength and quickly pa.s.sed through the pa.s.sage and rushed out.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>As soon as they rushed out, the three of them frowned and stopped.</p><p>This was because there were many people floating in the air outside, blocking the way.</p><p>“It’s him. It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone shouted as he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>These people had been attracted by the strange phenomenon here. They did not expect to see Lu Ming and the other two running out of the mountain the moment they arrived.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you get in there? Take it out and let’s see!”</p><p>A golden-robed young man stepped out, his eyes glimmering as he stared at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Ying Cang!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Ying Cang was from the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect. Back then, he had even asked someone to invite Lu Ming to join the Tian Hong sect, but Lu Ming had rejected him.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming did not know Ying Cang’s ident.i.ty. He only found out later that Ying Cang was ranked fourth on the virtual G.o.d ranking and was also the top expert in the outer sect of the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect.</p><p>“Ying Cang, are you thinking too much? what did I get? why do I have to take it out to see?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, not giving Ying Cang any face.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he was not afraid of anyone in the outer sect.</p><p>However, the others did not know Lu Ming’s combat strength. They were all shocked.</p><p>this Lu Ming is really bold. He actually dares to talk to Ying Cang like this!</p><p>“Overestimating your own ability, you’re just looking for death!”</p><p>Some people sneered in disdain.</p><p>As expected, Ying Cang’s eyes darkened.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming had rejected his invitation to join the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect, he had wanted to kill Lu Ming. He had ordered the people of the Tian Hong sect to kill Lu Ming if they had the chance to.</p><p>However, when he went to the forest of plants for training, the people from the Tian Hong sect did attack Lu Ming. However, they all died in Lu Ming’s hands. This made Ying Cang furious. He had been looking for an opportunity to kill Lu Ming personally.</p><p>Now, he finally had the chance.</p><p>you’ve just joined the sect, yet you don’t know how to respect your senior brother. You’re too arrogant. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of the sect!</p><p>Ying Cang said coldly. He stepped forward, and a powerful aura burst out, pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>First stage true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Without a doubt, after Ying Cang entered the dark Dragon secret land, his cultivation had also broken through, reaching the first stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>With his fighting power, breaking through to the first stage of true G.o.d Realm was a little stronger than mad Dao.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about the other party at all.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to take action, beams of light flew over from the distance. More people had arrived.</p><p>A few of them were extremely fast and gave off a shocking aura. In the blink of an eye, they had arrived.</p><p>The front section was filled with young people, both men and women. Each and every one of them had an extraordinary bearing, and they were all Dragons and phoenixes among men.</p><p>“It’s the Fengyuan Dao, the second-ranked virtual G.o.d ranking list’s Fengyuan Dao!”</p><p>there’s also the madman, the madman who’s ranked third on the virtual G.o.d ranking list!</p><p>“Li cunshan, seventh on the virtual G.o.d ranking!”</p><p>……</p><p>In the surroundings, many people cried out in surprise and widened their eyes.</p><p>This was because the people who had just arrived were too powerful. They were all in the top ten of the virtual G.o.d ranking in the outer sect of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Any one of these people could easily dominate the outer sect, but now, they came one after another.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
