He felt his Burning Blood begin to freeze. His body was stiff and he could not move.</p><p>“Save me …”</p><p>The young man from the red flame tribe shouted in fear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The Spear’s gleam pierced through and killed the genius of the Scarlet Flame tribe.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite who was not weaker than Liu shangkai had fallen just like that.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Immediately, there were roars of anger. Many of the Scarlet Flame clan’s prodigies looked at Lu Ming with rage.</p><p>The young man from the red flame tribe had an extraordinary status in the red flame tribe. He was extremely talented. However, he had fallen at the hands of Lu Ming. The members of the red flame tribe were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. He waved the ice chains continuously and they flew toward the Scarlet Flame tribe youths who were besieging an hai and the others. The Scarlet Flame tribe youths were shocked and dodged.</p><p>An hai and the rest also broke free and joined Lu Ming, charging forward together.</p><p>“Kill him! That brat must die! The others can surround him and not kill him. Kill that brat first!”</p><p>Yan Sen, who was fighting with Bing Qing, shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One by one, the youths of the Scarlet Flame tribe charged at Lu Ming. Some of them were moving at an astonishing speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, there was a three-meter-tall young man from the red flame tribe. His fist was as heavy as a mountain, and it was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and quickly waved his spear to block it.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His opponent’s punch landed on the long spear, causing it to shake violently. Lu Ming felt an overwhelming pressure pressing down on him. Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly, and he felt as if his arm was about to split open. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Strong. This young man from the Scarlet Flame clan, who was more than three meters tall, was astonishingly strong. Lu Ming felt that his combat strength was not weaker than Bing Qing’s.</p><p>Within the Scarlet Flame clan, there were many heaven’s favorites and experts. No wonder they were the strongest clan in the Qin Tian Galaxy. Without a doubt, they were also the strongest force.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to grind your bones and scatter your ashes. Kill them all. I’m going to kill them all.”</p><p>The red flame Tribe Youth, who was more than three meters tall, roared and kept punching Lu Ming with both fists.</p><p>At the same time, the other members of the Scarlet Flame tribe had also arrived. They charged toward Lu Ming, an hai, and the others.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two young men from the Kong Xuan sect were blown up in the air and turned into ashes in the scorching heat.</p><p>“We’re finished, we’re finished!”</p><p>A young man from the Kong Xuan sect shouted, revealing a look of despair.</p><p>Faced with such a situation, they would definitely die today.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was also facing immense pressure.</p><p>The three-meter tall young man was not the only powerful red flame tribe member. There were a few more behind him. Although they were not as strong as the former, they were still very terrifying. They attacked Lu Ming together, trying to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming could only control the ice chain to bind the other party.</p><p>However, the other party knew the power of the ice shackles. Naturally, they would not let Lu Ming have his way. As soon as the ice shackles were out, they retreated quickly and avoided them.</p><p>Only the young man from the red flame tribe, who was more than three meters tall, was fearless. His aura was wild, and his body was covered in blazing divine fire. He kept punching at the ice chains.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The burning fist force collided with the ice chain, but it did not extinguish. Instead, it sent the ice chain flying back.</p><p>The other party was too powerful, and Lu Ming’s cultivation was too low. The power of the ice chain was limited, after all, and it was impossible for him to cross a long distance to freeze his opponent. The Scarlet Flame Tribe Youth who was more than three meters tall had the ability to block it.</p><p>“I’ll block this strange chain. They’ll go kill him!”</p><p>The young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe, who was more than three meters tall, roared and launched an attack, targeting the ice chains. The other experts from the Scarlet Flame tribe, on the other hand, attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s situation became precarious.</p><p>Two more people from the Kong Xuan sect had died. At this moment, there were only five people left from the Kong Xuan sect, including Lu Ming.</p><p>The other four people, including an hai and the long-faced young man, were all seriously injured. Their faces were filled with despair.</p><p>At this moment, the ice Soul Clan and several other sects had suffered heavy losses. People were dying in battle. The number of people on their side was decreasing.</p><p>“What should we do? what should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly, trying to think of a way to escape.</p><p>However, the difference in strength between the two parties was too great. Even if Lu Ming wanted to escape alone, it would be difficult.</p><p>“Kid, we can only give it our all now.”</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the quant.i.ty formula rang in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Take a gamble? How do we fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly asked.</p><p>“Do you still remember the dark Dragon blood jade I absorbed in the dark Dragon secret realm?”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“The dark Dragon blood jade, could it be that you’ve already refined the dark Dragon blood Jade’s energy?”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>that’s right. After all these years, I’ve refined all the energy of the dark Dragon blood jade. I can pa.s.s it to you now. This energy is very strong. Even if you cultivate five divine flames, it’ll be enough for you to reach the true G.o.d Realm in a short time.</p><p>that’s right. It’s extremely dangerous to try to break through during a great battle. If you’re not careful, you might go into Qi deviation and die from an explosion.</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>I’ll definitely try. Please transfer your energy to me.</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>It wasn’t like he hadn’t tried to break through during a great battle before. He had plenty of experience.</p><p>alright, then get ready. Let’s begin.</p><p>As soon as the ‘measure’ character was spoken, Lu Ming felt that the ‘measure’ character in his sea of consciousness was shining. Then, a huge wave of energy gushed out from the ‘measure’ character and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This energy was extremely pure and could be converted into divine power in an instant.</p><p>“Refine, refine …”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the universe thousand Dao mantra frantically and began to refine it. This energy was quickly transformed into Lu Ming’s divine power.</p><p>The divine fire in Lu Ming’s dantian grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had reached the peak of the eighth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Then, with a boom, his body seemed to explode, and his aura suddenly soared.</p><p>Ninth level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>In just a breath’s time, Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced from eighth-level void G.o.d Realm to ninth-level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“You’ve broken through? How is that possible?”</p><p>The others were shocked. They did not expect Lu Ming to have a breakthrough in his cultivation in such a situation.</p><p>“Even if I break through, I’ll still die.”</p><p>The more than three-meter-tall young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe roared and charged at Lu Ming again. The other talents of the Scarlet Flame tribe also charged at Lu Ming. There were a total of nine experts who were charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit soared. He swept his long spear out continuously, clashing with his opponent.</p><p>However, even though Lu Ming’s cultivation base had broken through to ninth-tier void G.o.d-level, he was still not a match for so many Scarlet Flame clan’s prodigies in a head-on collision. He was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>Only by breaking through to the true G.o.d Realm could he kill his way out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
