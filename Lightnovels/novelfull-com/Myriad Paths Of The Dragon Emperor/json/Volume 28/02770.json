He was slightly shocked. At the same time, he changed the stance of his sword and slashed at the ninth ice chain.</p><p>However, when his combat sword struck the ninth ice chain, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>That was because he felt an extremely terrifying chill coming toward him. It was as if it was going to freeze his blood and even his divine power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The other ice chains trembled and wrapped around the dark-skinned old man, trying to trap him to death.</p><p>“This brat, what a shocking technique …”</p><p>The dark-skinned elder was shocked. He no longer cared about hiding his ident.i.ty. At this moment, he exploded with all his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His body erupted like a volcano. His divine power surged and attacked the coldness on his body. At the same time, sword lights burst out and swept away the ice chains.</p><p>However, even if he used all his strength, it was difficult for him to maintain his disguise. His body and muscles began to change, revealing his original appearance.</p><p>“Le Zhong!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his murderous intent cold.</p><p>That’s right. This dark-skinned elder was le Zhong. He had disguised himself and seemed to have cultivated some secret technique. Even his aura was hidden. Lu Ming did not recognize him at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve really surprised me. You’ve actually forced me to reveal my true form. However, you still have to die!”</p><p>Le shouted coldly, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>‘I must kill Lu Ming today,’ he roared in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. He was so young and his cultivation was only at the first stage of true G.o.d, but his combat strength was so terrifying that it was hard to imagine.</p><p>He was only at the first stage of the true G.o.d Realm, but under his continuous attacks, he was only injured and not dead. If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, he would find it hard to believe.</p><p>If Lu Ming was given a period of time to grow, he would be more powerful.</p><p>After some time, he was afraid that he would die in Lu Ming’s hands. Therefore, he had to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Le Zhong exploded with all his strength and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming turned around and left. He could not be bothered to fight with le Zhong.</p><p>With his current strength, he was indeed not le Zhong’s match. Even if he used all his means, he would still be no match for him. Since he was no match for him, it would be too stupid to continue fighting.</p><p>“This old fellow, I’ll kill him later.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>As long as he got the ancient G.o.d flower, his divine body would transform and he would be able to cultivate the battle character formula with four times his combat power. Then, he only needed to break through one more stage to reach the second stage of true G.o.d. Lu Ming was confident that he could fight le Zhong and even kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>“You want to leave? I will kill you no matter where you go today.”</p><p>He shouted coldly and chased after Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and the other escaping, continued to go deep into the valley.</p><p>Of course, there were also others who had been rushing into the depths of the valley.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, ancient G.o.d flowers appeared from time to time along the way, and some people stopped to fight for them.</p><p>After flying for a while, suddenly, a strong fragrance came from ahead.</p><p>At the same time, there was an extremely dense energy fluctuation that permeated the air.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s figure could not help but stop. He widened his eyes and looked ahead in a daze.</p><p>“Brat, why aren’t you running anymore …”</p><p>Le Zhong caught up with him quickly, but before he could finish his words, his figure stopped. His eyes were wide open as he looked in front of him in disbelief.</p><p>It wasn’t just the two of them. Some of the other people who had rushed here were also in the same state.</p><p>He was dumbfounded and tongue-tied, but immediately after that, he felt a deep sense of greed.</p><p>That was because the front was filled with ancient G.o.d flowers.</p><p>There was a flat piece of land in front of them. There were valleys in eight directions on this piece of land. The valley that Lu Ming and the others were in was only one of the eight.</p><p>The eight valleys converged here.</p><p>This place was filled with ancient G.o.d flowers.</p><p>There was an uncountable number of ancient G.o.d flowers. It was like an ocean of ancient G.o.d flowers, swaying and mesmerizing.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Even Lu Ming could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>He had never expected there to be so many ancient G.o.d flowers here.</p><p>Ten Thousand Flowers? Twenty thousand?</p><p>In short, it was hard to count.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m rich, I’m rich.”</p><p>“With so many ancient G.o.d flowers, how strong can my G.o.d Body be?“</p><p>The crowd finally reacted. Many of them rushed toward the ancient G.o.d flowers with red eyes.</p><p>“Ancient G.o.d flower …”</p><p>Le Zhong’s eyes were filled with greed. He could not care less about killing Lu Ming and pounced on the ancient G.o.d flower.</p><p>His desire for the ancient G.o.d flower was stronger than his desire to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed forward. His divine power condensed into a huge hand and grabbed an ancient G.o.d flower.</p><p>However, he couldn’t grab it.</p><p>Runes began to appear at the flower’s roots, forming a circle of light that protected the flower.</p><p>there’s a great formation protecting it. This ancient G.o.d flower is actually protected by a great formation …</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He tried to grab another ancient G.o.d flower, but the result was the same. When Lu Ming grabbed it, runes emerged from the root of the ancient G.o.d flower, forming a circle of light that enveloped the ancient G.o.d flower.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, what’s going on? I actually can’t pick it. ”</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, this ancient G.o.d flower is protected by a formation.”</p><p>15:35</p><p>The others also roared.</p><p>They couldn’t pick a flower, not a single one. All the ancient G.o.d flowers were protected by the formation, which made everyone’s faces extremely gloomy.</p><p>It was like a Gold Mountain in front of him, but he couldn’t get it.</p><p>amazing, amazing! This is a huge array with all the ancient G.o.d flowers planted in the eye of the array. There are so many eyes of the array. What is the person who set up the array trying to do? ”</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the black skeleton sat on the painting and muttered to himself. He was looking at everything outside.</p><p>“They’re all planted in the eye of the formation.”</p><p>The gaze from inside also focused.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard the black skeleton’s words. There was a huge wave in his heart.</p><p>If that was the case, then this formation was incredible. How many formation eyes were there?</p><p>The others all tried to pick other ancient G.o.d flowers, but without exception, they all failed. No one was able to pick a single ancient G.o.d flower.</p><p>At this moment, more and more people came from behind. When they saw the ocean of ancient G.o.d flowers, they were also shocked. Then, they joined the group to pick the flowers. Naturally, no one was able to pick a single flower.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying air-piercing sound came from all directions.</p><p>They were arrows that were like black Lightning, shooting toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. A long spear appeared and swept out continuously, deflecting a few arrows.</p><p>&Nbsp; but not everyone reacted so quickly. Screams rang out as many people were shot by arrows and died in the ancient G.o.d Flower Sea.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
