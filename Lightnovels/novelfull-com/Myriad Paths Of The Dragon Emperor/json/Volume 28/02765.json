I’ll leave it to you now.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the fu family.</p><p>Only then did the fu family people wake up from their daze.</p><p>That stage four true G.o.d old man walked over and stared at a black-clothed man as he asked, ” “Speak, Who are you?”</p><p>“Don’t even think about getting anything out of me!”</p><p>The black-clothed man said gloomily.</p><p>Hmph, you’re all wearing black robes to cover your faces and hide your heads and tails. You’re afraid that people will recognize you. I’d like to see who you are.</p><p>The fu clan elder waved his hand and tore off the black robe, revealing a middle-aged man’s face.</p><p>Seeing this person’s face, the fu clan elder was stunned for a moment before revealing a shocked expression. He roared, it’s you, 19 guardians. Are you the people of protectorate Lord Youfeng? ”</p><p>The fu clan elder’s voice trembled as if he was extremely shocked.</p><p>region master wandering wind. It’s actually the region master wandering wind.</p><p>“We’re finished, we’re finished!”</p><p>The other members of the fu clan were also pale with fear.</p><p>“Region master wandering wind?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>young hero, it’s like this. After many years of war, the ancient G.o.d Star has been divided into many territories. Each territory has a territory master. The wandering wind region master is the ruler of this territory. He is the Overlord of this territory.</p><p>The fu clan elder explained.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>I didn’t expect that it would actually be protectorate Lord Youfeng who sent someone to attack. I didn’t expect …</p><p>The fu clan elder sighed.</p><p>Their Fu clan was merely a power governed by the wandering wind protectorate Lord. How could they possibly contend with the wandering wind protectorate Lord?</p><p>Now that protectorate Lord Youfeng had set his eyes on them, the fu clan would most likely be annihilated.</p><p>Hmph, since you know that we’re domain lord Youfeng’s men, why don’t you let us go? ”</p><p>The 19 protectors said with a dark and cold expression.</p><p>Since he had been recognized, he no longer had to hide it.</p><p>“That’s right, let us go.”</p><p>The other Men in Black also shouted.</p><p>The fu clan elder and the other Fu clan members were hesitant.</p><p>“Just now, so many of their people have already died. Also, that so-called region master Youfeng has already set his eyes on your Fu clan. Do you think that if you let these people go, the other party will let your Fu clan go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Kid, you …”</p><p>The 19 guardians and the other black-robed men are all greatly shocked.</p><p>that’s right. Kill, kill all of them. We can even weaken the strength of the region master of the wandering wind region.</p><p>The fu clan elder gritted his teeth and revealed a ruthless expression.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>The 19 guardians are shocked and furious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blade light flashed as the fu clan’s old man made his move, splitting the 19 guardians in half.</p><p>“Attack! Kill them all!”</p><p>The fu clan elder roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The fu clan had all attacked the black-robed men.</p><p>The Men in Black were bound by Lu Ming’s ice chains and could not resist at all. They were killed one after another. Soon, more than a hundred people were all dead.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the ice chain.</p><p>“Young hero, can … Can I invite you to the fu family as a guest?”</p><p>The fu clan elder stammered.</p><p>Next, the fu clan would definitely have to face the revenge of the region master Youfeng. With their Fu clan’s strength, they would definitely not be able to withstand it and would only be destroyed.</p><p>However, the abilities that Lu Ming had just displayed were extremely shocking.</p><p>To have such combat strength at such a young age, he was definitely not from the ancient G.o.d Star. There was a high possibility that he was a genius disciple from one of the major forces in the Qin heaven Star Zone. He wanted to ask Lu Ming for help. Perhaps he could help the fu family tide over this crisis.</p><p>“What’s the domain lord wandering wind’s cultivation base?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I heard that he’s at the eighth stage of true G.o.d Realm.”</p><p>The fu family old man said. When talking about stage eight true G.o.d Realm, his expression was extremely solemn.</p><p>An eighth stage true G.o.d wasn’t something their Fu clan could go up against. Their Fu clan’s strongest expert was only at fifth stage true G.o.d.</p><p>“Stage eight true G.o.d Realm? Alright, I’ll go with you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t take the eighth stage true G.o.d to heart. Even if it was an eighth stage true G.o.d who controlled King-grade divine power, Lu Ming wasn’t afraid.</p><p>Lu Ming would not be a match for those top geniuses who had mastered terrifying secret skills or whose divine power was of the Holy grade.</p><p>“Thank you, young hero.”</p><p>The fu clan elder was overjoyed when he heard Lu Ming’s agreement. The other Fu clan members were also overjoyed.</p><p>The crowd cleaned up the battlefield. Lu Ming followed the fu clan members and headed back to the fu clan.</p><p>A group of people came to welcome him as soon as he arrived at the fu clan.</p><p>“Grand Elder, what’s the situation? There seems to be a big battle over there just now.”</p><p>A middle-aged man in luxurious clothes came over and asked the fu clan elder.</p><p>The fu clan’s old man was the fu clan’s Grand Elder.</p><p>“Clan head, there was indeed a huge battle just now. The other party is region master Youfeng’s man.”</p><p>The fu clan’s first elder said.</p><p>“What? Region master wandering wind?”</p><p>The fu clan head’s face was as white as snow.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to this young hero Lu Ming that we’re still alive.”</p><p>The first elder of the fu family immediately explained what had happened.</p><p>After the master of the fu family heard that, he naturally thanked Lu Ming profusely and treated Lu Ming as a distinguished guest.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stayed at the fu residence.</p><p>As for the fu clan, they were nervously on guard, waiting for the arrival of a powerful enemy.</p><p>Three days later, at dawn.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack!”</p><p>A sharp sound broke the silence of the early morning.</p><p>A dense crowd of people flew out from the fu clan’s Palace and laid down a defensive formation, waiting in antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He moved and left his room, standing in the air.</p><p>The fu clan was surrounded by a large crowd. A terrifying pressure was surging towards the fu clan like a tide.</p><p>protectorate Lord wandering wind, it’s really him …</p><p>Many of the fu clan members muttered to themselves as they stared at an old man with pale faces.</p><p>This elder was dressed in a golden robe and exuded a dignified aura. He was the governor of the wandering wind protectorate.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! protectorate Lord Youfeng stepped forward, causing the sky to rumble. His divine power boiled, and his powerful aura formed a terrifying pressure that enveloped the fu clan.</p><p>Many of the fu clan members trembled and almost couldn’t withstand the pressure.</p><p>“Protectorate Lord Youfeng, may I know how my Fu clan has offended you to the point that you’ve gathered so many people here?”</p><p>The fu clan head braced himself and stepped forward, cupping his fists in respect.</p><p>you know the answer. Hand over the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain and you can spare your life.</p><p>Region master wandering wind said coldly.</p><p>zone leader, the fu family really doesn’t have a map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. If we did, we would have handed it over a long time ago.</p><p>The fu clan head said.</p><p>He meant what he said. If he had a map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain, he would hand it over immediately in exchange for the fu clan’s peace.</p><p>Humph, you don’t have to quibble. The map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain was made of point soul gold. Point soul gold has a special characteristic, which is that it can sense each other even if they are far away from each other.</p><p>and I happen to have a small piece of remnant soul gold. Through the soul gold, I can sense that there is definitely some soul gold in this area, but it’s so rare that there aren’t many on the ancient G.o.d Star. It’s very likely that it’s the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Region master wandering wind said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
