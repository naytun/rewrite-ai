Now, for the outer sect disciples who have registered, I will draw lots to decide their opponents …</p><p>An inner sect elder landed on the fighting ring and announced the rules of the compet.i.tion. Then, he drew lots to start the compet.i.tion.</p><p>First, the outer sect disciples took action, and the fierce battle began.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not very interested in the compet.i.tion between outer disciples.</p><p>Moreover, there weren’t many experts worth paying attention to.</p><p>People like wing demon, Fengyuan Dao, and madman, who used to be in the top ten of the virtual G.o.d ranking list, had already broken through the true G.o.d Realm and become inner disciples. Now, there were fewer talents in the outer sect, and there was a shortage of new talents.</p><p>However, many people were still watching the battle seriously, especially those from the factions of the seven Saints and saintesses. They were looking at the geniuses from the outer sect. If they didn’t join any factions, they could come out and invite them.</p><p>The compet.i.tion between the outer sect disciples lasted for half a month before it finally ended.</p><p>After that, it was time for the compet.i.tion between the inner disciples.</p><p>The inner sect disciples ‘compet.i.tion was the real highlight and would attract a lot of attention.</p><p>Of course, not all inner sect disciples had to partic.i.p.ate. The rule was that only true G.o.d Realm experts had to partic.i.p.ate. When one reached the heavenly G.o.d Realm, because the number was too small and they were too strong, they didn’t need to partic.i.p.ate.</p><p>The battle between the true G.o.d Realm experts, each major sect sent their true G.o.d Realm experts, it was indeed very exciting.</p><p>Lu Ming was also dazzled by the scene.</p><p>There were all sorts of different races, all sorts of divine skills, and even all sorts of secret Arts. All of them had extraordinary power and all sorts of divine abilities.</p><p>However, on the whole, it was still the Supreme Holy son’s faction that suppressed the others.</p><p>In the end, all the major sects finally sent their top experts on the real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>There were only a hundred people on the real G.o.d ranking list. When they were split among the Qin heaven thirteen clans, each clan had less than ten people.</p><p>Moreover, the number of people on the real G.o.d ranking list had always been dominated by the three overlords.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had a total of eight people on the real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>These eight people were all from the seven Saint and saintess factions.</p><p>The other six Holy Sons and holy virgins had one each, while the Supreme Holy son’s faction had two.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the fighting ring, two top experts on real G.o.d ranking list were fighting fiercely and colliding continuously.</p><p>the experts on real G.o.d ranking list are indeed shockingly powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it carefully and sighed in his heart.</p><p>The two people on the fighting ring were both stronger than le Zhong.</p><p>One should know that le Zhong had been at the peak of the true G.o.d Realm for countless years. He had cultivated quite a few divine skills to the peak of the fourth stage and controlled King-grade divine power, so his combat strength was not weak.</p><p>However, both of them were above the music.</p><p>The real G.o.d ranking list listed the strongest group of people in the real G.o.d stage and it was not just for show.</p><p>One of them was from the Tianhong Saint son’s faction, while the other was from the zhixia Saint son’s faction.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves. In the end, the expert from the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect won by a slight margin and defeated the other party.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son smiled, while the zhixia Saint son looked gloomy.</p><p>The compet.i.tion continued and it was already at the final stage. It was all the battles between experts on the real G.o.d ranking list and every match was extremely exciting.</p><p>A few more days pa.s.sed before the compet.i.tion finally ended.</p><p>This time, it was still the Supreme Holy son’s faction that suppressed everyone else and took first place in overall strength.</p><p>There was one person from the Supreme Saint son’s faction who was terrifyingly powerful. He was ranked sixth on the real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>The top ten of the real G.o.d ranking list were mostly occupied by the three Overlord forces. They were ranked sixth on the real G.o.d ranking list, which showed how powerful they were.</p><p>This person was the number one true G.o.d expert of the Kong Xuan sect, and there was no doubt that the Supreme Holy son’s faction would be the number one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
