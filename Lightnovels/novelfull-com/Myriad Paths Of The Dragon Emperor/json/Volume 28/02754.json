That was how he had gotten to know the inner sanctum disciples of the unique demon Academy. However, his cultivation was still far from being a true G.o.d.</p><p>Lu Ming, so what if he was talented? So what if he obtained first place in the Qin heavenly thirteen clans? He had joined the Kong Xuan sect stupidly. How could his status be compared to that of the inner disciples of the unique demon Academy?</p><p>Therefore, as soon as the inner sanctum disciples of the unique demon Academy arrived, a few forces that had intended to remain neutral immediately joined forces with them and attacked the righteous Army.</p><p>With the Alliance of the few major forces, they did not even need the inner disciples of the unique demon Academy to attack. They had already broken into the core of the righteous heavenly Army.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks turned into beams of divine light and bombarded the zhengtian Army’s Mountain-protecting formation. The formation trembled, and cracks began to appear on it.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Within the mountain protecting formation, the faces of the zhengtian Army soldiers were extremely ugly.</p><p>“At most, we’ll fight them to the death.”</p><p>“Not bad, killing one is enough, killing two is good.”</p><p>Many people roared, showing expressions of swearing to die together.</p><p>In the middle, the ancestor of technique was silent and didn’t speak.</p><p>In the crowd, the ancestral Dragon, the t.i.tan longhorn beetle, the nine lives demonic cicada, and the others all looked serious.</p><p>I never thought that we would still die at the hands of the serene Palace even after we escaped from the heaven realm. Is this our fate? ”</p><p>Some people sighed, feeling somewhat unwilling.</p><p>They had finally defeated the evil G.o.d race after much difficulty and escaped from the small chiliocosm to the primal universe. However, they still couldn’t escape from the nether Palace.</p><p>I hope that Lu Ming can take revenge for us in the future.</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>it’s hard to say. Among them, there are inner disciples of the Yimo Academy, one of the three overlords of the qintian Galaxy. They are too strong. This is not a small chiliocosm of the heaven realm and the primordial realm. This is a huge force in the primeval universe. How can Lu Ming defeat them? ”</p><p>that’s right. I reckon that the people from the unique devil Academy will still deal with Lu Ming in the future. I’m afraid that Lu Ming will not be able to even protect himself. After all, this is not a small chiliocosm!</p><p>Some of the heaven realm experts were discussing helplessly.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the primordial realm, they could be considered experts, but in the primeval universe, they were nothing. They could only be considered at the bottom.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was an unprecedented genius in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, he was only in a small chiliocosm. In a large chiliocosm, he was probably not much.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>At this moment, the protective formation let out a cracking sound. More and more cracks appeared, and finally, with a bang, it exploded.</p><p>The mountain-protecting formation was broken!</p><p>“Prepare to fight!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Don’t act rashly, get into a defensive formation.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted and stopped everyone.</p><p>“Remember, the person they want to kill is me. If I die in battle, you all must surrender. Do you understand?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s gaze swept across the people of the righteous Army.</p><p>“No, we would rather die than surrender.”</p><p>“That’s right, we will never surrender.”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army shouted.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was also helpless.</p><p>“Surrender? Hehe, that’s fine too. We’ll only kill a few of you, and most of you can surrender as long as you’re honest in the future.”</p><p>The leader of the free and unfettered sect, situ haonan, sneered. He took the first step forward, Kang Ji and the others followed.</p><p>don’t move yet. This is my order!</p><p>The ancestor of technique instructed. His gaze became sharp. Many people’s expressions changed as they gritted their teeth and lowered their heads.</p><p>“Kang Ji, situ haonan, I’ll fight with you. Let’s see who can do anything to me?”</p><p>After that, the ancestor of technique stepped into the air alone. A battle sword appeared in his hand, and his battle intent soared.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was facing the free and unfettered sect, Nether Hall, and their Army alone.</p><p>“Fa Ming, do you think that you can fight all of us with just a medium-grade seventh-rank combat sword?”</p><p>Situ haonan sneered.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted. His battle intent was like a rainbow as he swept towards situ haonan and the others.</p><p>Situ haonan and the others turned their gazes, but no one made a move. They were very clear about how terrifying the ancestor of technique’s combat power was, especially situ haonan, Kang Ji, mo kan, and a few others. They had all fought with the ancestor of technique before, so they naturally wouldn’t make the first move.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s there to be arrogant about? I’ll fight you.”</p><p>Beside Kang Ji, a brawny man in blood-red armor stepped out with a blood-red saber on his shoulder. His body emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>This burly man was from another force, a Grand Elder of the blood red a.s.sociation. He was at the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm and his fighting power was not below that of situ haonan and the others.</p><p>He had never fought with the ancestor of technique before, so he was naturally not afraid of him.</p><p>Seeing this person attack, situ haonan and the others didn’t stop him. They could use this person to test the ancestor of technique’s strength.</p><p>“Make your move. I’ll give you the chance to make your move.”</p><p>The ancestor of technique looked at the Grand Elder of the blood red a.s.sociation indifferently.</p><p>“Arrogant! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The Grand Elder of the red blood society shouted coldly. Violent divine power burst out. The saber in his hand whizzed out and slashed at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ancestor of technique also slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blade and the sword collided with a loud boom. Then, a figure retreated. It was the Grand Elder of the red blood a.s.sociation.</p><p>He was no match for the ancestor of technique in the first move and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted. His body was like a rainbow light as he charged towards the Grand Elder of the blood red a.s.sociation. Sword light broke through the sky one after another, and it was endless.</p><p>“Divine skill at the peak of stage three, you …”</p><p>The Grand Elder of the red blood a.s.sociation was shocked.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s divine skill was already at the peak of the third stage. With the addition of a middle-grade level Seven divine weapon, even if the ancestor of technique was only at the third stage of true G.o.d, his combat power was far above his.</p><p>He kept retreating and wanted to escape, but the ancestor of technique wouldn’t let him escape. After slashing dozens of times, he split the man’s strength and killed him on the spot.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The master of the red blood society roared in anger. His heart ached so much that he felt like dying.</p><p>The blood red a.s.sociation only had a total of three stage four true G.o.d Realm experts. Now that one of them had died in battle, he couldn’t wait to tear the ancestor of technique into pieces.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s aura was wild as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>how dare you kill the Grand Elder of the blood red a.s.sociation? you’re courting death.</p><p>The president of the red blood a.s.sociation roared furiously. Like a Mad Lion, he burst out and emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>Fifth stage true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>This was the cultivation of the president of the red blood society. His cultivation was even stronger than situ haonan, Kang Ji and the others.</p><p>The power of the blood red a.s.sociation had always been greater than that of the nether Hall, the carefree sect, and the righteous Army. This time, he had attacked the righteous Army because he wanted to curry favor with the inner disciples of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“Stage five true G.o.d Realm? Come on!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s eyes were filled with battle intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The president of the red blood a.s.sociation shouted and slashed out with his saber. In an instant, dozens of saber lights were slashed at the vital parts of the ancestor of technique’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
