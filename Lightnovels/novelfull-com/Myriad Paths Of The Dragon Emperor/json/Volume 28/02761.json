It’s only been a few decades and he’s already an inner disciple.”</p><p>A young man said in shock.</p><p>this man is a monster. When he grows up in the future, I’m afraid he will pose a threat to the saint’s position. We must get rid of him.</p><p>Huang Wen said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Huang Wen, I heard that you and your brother have a grudge against Lu Ming. Because of this, Lu Ming even killed many people from the transient light sect when he was in the outer sect? Isn’t that right?”</p><p>Some people looked at Huang Wen.</p><p>These people were all from the sacred son of reflection’s faction. They were all experts from the inner sect.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Huang Wen nodded.</p><p>“Since there’s a grudge between us, we must get rid of him as soon as possible. Send someone to keep a close eye on Lu Ming’s movements. Once he leaves the Kong Xuan sect, send someone to get rid of him.”</p><p>A young man looked at Huang Wen and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Huang Wen nodded as a cold killing intent flashed in his eyes. However, deep in his eyes, there was a trace of fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s growth rate was too shocking. It made him feel fear.</p><p>……</p><p>In another luxurious courtyard in the inner court, a group of people gathered together as if they were waiting for someone.</p><p>Within this group of people, there was actually an outer sect Deacon, le Zhong.</p><p>These people were all from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>“The Saint is here.”</p><p>Someone suddenly called out.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a few figures descended from the sky. The one in the lead was a handsome young man in luxurious clothes. He exuded a n.o.ble temperament.</p><p>This person was the leader of the Tianhong sect, the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>He was one of the five Saints of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had a total of five Saints and two saintesses. He was one of the strongest disciples and had a chance of becoming the sect leader.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, one could not become a Holy Son or Holy daughter just because they had mastered the divine power.</p><p>Mastering divine grade divine power was only the most basic condition. It also depended on one’s cultivation and combat power. Only when one met these requirements could they become a Holy Son or Holy daughter.</p><p>To become a saint or saintess, one had to be at least a heavenly G.o.d.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Saint!”</p><p>Le Zhong and the others immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Rise. I’ve just come out of seclusion. Why are you looking for me?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>“Saint, it’s because of an outer sect disciple. No, he’s already an inner sect Disciple Now.”</p><p>A young man answered.</p><p>someone who just became an inner sect disciple? ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was confused. Was there a need to report to him about someone who had just become an inner disciple?</p><p>Saint, this person is a monster with shocking talent. He has only been in the sect for. few decades and has already become an inner sect disciple. His combat strength is also amazing …</p><p>He walked out happily and told her about Lu Ming’s performance during this period.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son frowned.</p><p>“This person is extremely arrogant. Our Tian Hong sect had invited him to join us from the very beginning, but he didn’t care at all. I guess he’s also very ambitious. He wants to form his own sect in the future and compete for the position of sect leader. Many people from our Tian Hong sect have died in his hands, including Ying Cang.”</p><p>Le Zhong continued.</p><p>“Ying Cang is dead!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes flashed, and he exuded cold killing intent.</p><p>Ying Cang was ranked fourth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. He was very talented and could become his powerful subordinate when he grew up. However, he had died in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>you still want to form your own faction? the Kong Xuan sect has seven major factions, which is more than enough. Also, since we’ve already made enemies, we have to get rid of them as soon as possible.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>don’t worry, Saint. I’ll send someone to keep an eye on this kid. Once I have the chance, I’ll personally take action and get rid of this person.</p><p>Le Zhong said coldly.</p><p>“Alright, I’m relieved to have you take action.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said. Then, everyone started to discuss other matters.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming knew nothing about this. He and Qiu Yue had been cultivating in seclusion in the divine pulse tower.</p><p>The divine pulse tower was too useful for Qiu Yue. In less than half a year, Qiu Yue’s aura had reached the peak and she was trying to break through to the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>A few days later, Qiu Yue successfully broke through to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>After Qiu Yue’s breakthrough, Lu Ming was relieved. He left Qiu Yue alone in the divine pulse tower to cultivate while he left for the divine technique Valley to cultivate the divine skills.</p><p>Spring went and autumn came. In the blink of an eye, twenty years had pa.s.sed.</p><p>In the past twenty years, Lu Ming had been focused on cultivation.</p><p>His three divine skills had all made great progress.</p><p>He had reached the fourth level of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>The fourth level of the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>The fourth layer of the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor.</p><p>All of them had reached the fourth level, which was very shocking. The higher the level of a divine skill, the more difficult it was to cultivate. Of course, the power would also be stronger.</p><p>Many experts at the peak of true G.o.d had only cultivated their divine skills to the fourth stage. Only some terrifying prodigies could possibly cultivate to the fifth stage at the peak of true G.o.d. Lu Ming had just broken through to true G.o.d and he had already reached the fourth stage. Moreover, he had three types. If this was known by others, their eyes would pop out of their sockets.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming had also fused eight Cold Moon Stones into the secret skill, ice shackles. The ice shackles was officially completed and its power was shocking.</p><p>In twenty years, Lu Ming’s cultivation level did not increase. He was still at the first stage of true G.o.d, but it had been completely stabilized and he was slowly approaching the second stage of true G.o.d.</p><p>It was more difficult and took a longer time to level up to true G.o.d-level. Moreover, Lu Ming had cultivated five divine flames. It would be more difficult to level up.</p><p>It was normal to not have a breakthrough in twenty years.</p><p>However, compared to twenty years ago, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by more than one level.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the battle character formula has reached a bottleneck. It’s hard to break through.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He had almost reached a 100% success rate of the battle formula’s triple combat power, but he still couldn’t reach quadruple combat power.</p><p>He had encountered a bottleneck and tried all sorts of methods, but it was difficult to improve.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s hard for you to level up because your divine body isn’t strong enough.”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice rang out in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>It was the sound of the battle formula.</p><p>The battle symbol art had always been very quiet and rarely spoke, but now it spoke.</p><p>“His divine body isn’t strong enough?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned for a moment before he came to a realization.</p><p>The battle character formula triggered a higher number of combat power, and the requirement for the divine body was indeed very high.</p><p>If his divine body wasn’t strong enough, he wouldn’t be able to use the battle formula.</p><p>that’s right. It’s just that your divine body isn’t strong enough. If you want to cultivate the battle character formula to quadruple your combat power, you have to increase the strength of your divine body. Otherwise, you won’t be able to cultivate to quadruple your combat power in your entire life. In fact, when your cultivation gets stronger in the future, you won’t even be able to triple or double your combat power.</p><p>The ” battle ” character said.</p><p>divine body. How should I improve my divine body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>When he came to the primeval universe, he found that the creatures in the primeval universe paid attention to the cultivation of divine power. As their divine power became stronger, it would also subtly temper their divine bodies.</p><p>Hence, the higher one’s cultivation was, the stronger one’s divine body would be.</p><p>However, there were no divine techniques that could improve the divine body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
