However, this time, it was le Zhong who retreated instead of Lu Ming.</p><p>Le Zhong’s body retreated and trembled. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You … How can you use your full power?”</p><p>Le Zhong roared in shock.</p><p>In such an environment, he had to divert most of his power to resist the blood-red mist outside, so his combat power was naturally greatly reduced.</p><p>He had thought that even if Lu Ming had a treasure to resist the blood-colored mist, it would consume a large amount of divine power to activate it and his own strength would be weakened. He had thought that it would not be a problem to take Lu Ming down.</p><p>However, in the collision just now, Lu Ming was in his peak state. His combat strength was at its peak.</p><p>“Old man, go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and charged towards le Zhong. This time, he used the same move, moon slash. At the same time, the nine ice chains also wrapped around le Zhong.</p><p>“I don’t believe it.”</p><p>He bellowed in the music and slashed a sword light at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, after their attacks collided, le Zhong’s sword light collapsed instantly. He was sent flying by Lu Ming and coughed up a large amount of blood.</p><p>The most terrifying thing was that his protective divine energy was almost shattered by Lu Ming. The blood-colored mist took advantage of the situation and broke through le Zhong’s defense, touching his body.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>White smoke rose from le Zhong’s body. A large piece of flesh was corroded. Le Zhong was so scared that he turned around and ran.</p><p>He was afraid. He no longer had the thought of killing Lu Ming. He only wanted to run away as soon as possible and get as far away from Lu Ming as possible.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him escape? the nine ice chains wrapped around le Zhong.</p><p>Although le Zhong resisted with all his might, he had to fight against the blood-colored mist and could not use much strength. He was bound by the chains and the terrifying chill was about to freeze him.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, Lu Ming. Even if I die, I won’t let you have an easy time. Men, this kid has a treasure that can block the blood-colored mist’s attack. As long as we get this treasure, we won’t die. Men …”</p><p>He roared in joy, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>Instantly, many people heard it.</p><p>“What? Someone is controlling a treasure that can resist the blood-red mist. I must get it. ”</p><p>this treasure is mine! Anyone who blocks me will die!</p><p>Everyone was in a frenzy and they charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The rest of the people understood that if this continued, they would die sooner or later. However, if they had a treasure that could resist the blood-colored mist, they would be able to survive. It would be strange if they didn’t go crazy.</p><p>“You think you can kill me with this method? Since you’re so stupid, I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard and he thrust his spear at le Zhong.</p><p>Le Zhong was bound by the ice chains and couldn’t Dodge at all. He was pierced by the spear and died.</p><p>He waved his hand and kept le Zhong’s storage ring.</p><p>At that moment, the others rushed over. They realized that there was a layer of black light on Lu Ming’s body that could separate the blood-colored mist. Their eyes turned red instantly.</p><p>“It can really block out the blood-colored mist.”</p><p>“Kid, hand over your treasure.”</p><p>Everyone had a greedy look on their faces as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hmph, since you’re looking for death, I’ll send you on your way in advance.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The nine ice chains flew out as Lu Ming cast the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>After a single shot, two experts were killed.</p><p>Those who were still alive were undoubtedly experts. Almost all of them were domain lord level characters. However, these people were not Lu Ming’s match even at their peak. Now that they had to divert a large portion of their energy to fight against the blood-colored mist, they were no match for Lu Ming. They were completely crushed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved unhindered, the Spear’s gleam surged and the experts were killed one by one.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains danced and wrapped around the experts, sealing them in ice.</p><p>A ma.s.sacre!</p><p>It was a complete ma.s.sacre.</p><p>There had been more than a hundred people who had charged at Lu Ming earlier. However, Lu Ming had killed them all in an instant. Not a single one was left. The storage rings of these people had also entered Lu Ming’s pocket.</p><p>These people were all region Masters and they were definitely wealthy. Lu Ming had made a fortune.</p><p>On the cliff, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were waiting quietly.</p><p>At this moment, the fog was already very thick, and they couldn’t see what was happening below. However, they still heard the sound just now.</p><p>there’s a treasure that can withstand the attack of the formation? ”</p><p>Some people’s gazes moved.</p><p>“Impossible. Even a high quality divine artifact can’t stop it. At most, it can buy us some time. If we’re still going to die after a while, we’ll just wait quietly.”</p><p>The young man on the northern side of the cliff sneered.</p><p>At the bottom of the cliff, Lu Ming had killed more than a hundred Masters. In an instant, he was the only one left in the area. The place was deathly silent. He realized that the ancient G.o.d flowers underground had become more beautiful.</p><p>Under the corrosion of the blood-colored mist, the blood and flesh of the experts who were killed by Lu Ming turned into liquid and were absorbed by the earth.</p><p>“What a vicious evil formation. Senior bone demon, this fog is blocked, but how do I get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“It’s easy to get out. You can do it on your own.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“By myself?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>The light shield formed by the formation was extremely strong. So many experts had attacked it together, but they could not break it at all. How could he break it?</p><p>“Right. You have to rely on yourself. One of the Chains of Ice that you train in is shockingly powerful. It’s filled with a terrifyingly cold aura that’s enough to break through this formation’s barrier of light.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“The frozen shackles. Could it be the ninth frozen shackle?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and decided to give it a try.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around for a while before he headed north. When he arrived at the cliff in the North, he restrained his aura and flew upwards.</p><p>&Nbsp; the youth and the other ancient G.o.d descendants on the cliff didn’t notice at all.</p><p>When Lu Ming was close to the cliff, he suddenly cast the ice chain. The ninth ice chain was like a white lightning bolt, rushing toward the light shield.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>When the ninth ice chain touched the light shield, to Lu Ming’s surprise, the light shield was pierced through.</p><p>The ice chains quickly wrapped around the young man.</p><p>The ice chains quickly wrapped around the young man.</p><p>It was easy to tell that the young man had a high status among the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. As long as they took the young man as a hostage, Lu Ming might be able to escape and get many ancient G.o.d flowers.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were all very relaxed. They didn’t think that anyone would be able to break out of the array. When they realized that the ice chains were going to wrap around the youth, it was already too late.</p><p>“Be careful …”</p><p>Someone shouted to remind him and rushed towards the ice chains. However, it was all over. The ice chains wrapped around the young man and pulled him into the formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
