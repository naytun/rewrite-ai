Some cheap secret skills were very cheap. For example, the soul transformation technique that Lu Ming had bought back then could conceal the color, aura, level, and so on of divine power. To most people, such secret skills were of little value. Hence, they were not expensive.</p><p>However, some secret skills were shockingly expensive.</p><p>For example, the secret skills on the fifth floor of the Scripture chamber of Kong Xuan sect were all very precious and useful. Even the cheapest one cost 100000 points.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at them one by one. He was tempted by many of them. However, not all the secret skills were suitable for him.</p><p>In fact, there were many secret skills that had very strict cultivation conditions and various restrictions.</p><p>For example, some secret skills required a corresponding divine power, some special materials, or requirements for the divine body.</p><p>The more powerful it was, the more stringent the requirements would be.</p><p>Therefore, many people could cultivate one or two secret skills at most, and they were all amazing. Generally, it was impossible to master too many secret skills.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a secret skill called ice chain.</p><p>This kind of secret skill required one to control extremely cold divine power to cultivate.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had cultivated the divine ice technique. Now, he had exchanged for the first stage of the ultimate cold divine technique. As long as he cultivated the ultimate cold divine force, it was just right to cultivate the ice chain.</p><p>Once the ice shackles was successfully cultivated, it would form several ice shackles with amazing power. It had the effect of attacking and trapping enemies. Moreover, as one’s cultivation level increased in the future, the power would also increase.</p><p>However, the exchange price was shocking. It required 250000 points.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire fortune only had a little more than 370000 points. He had obtained 360000 points from this trip to the dark Dragon secret realm. He had more than 10000 points left previously. In total, he had more than 370000 points.</p><p>Previously, he had used fifty thousand points to exchange for the ‘divine formula of extreme cold’. Then, the’ nine heavenly kun Peng technique ‘required thirty thousand points. If he were to continue exchanging for the’ ice chain’, Lu Ming would be left with a little more than forty thousand points.</p><p>“I’ve exchanged!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and decided to redeem the points. The remaining forty thousand points were enough for the time being. The key was to convert the points into strength.</p><p>After making his decision, Lu Ming went to the door and exchanged for the ” nine stage kun Peng technique ” and ” ice chain ” from the elder.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was able to fork out so many points even though he was only at seventh-tier void G.o.d Realm, the elder was taken aback. He guessed that Lu Ming might be the disciple of an important figure in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After successfully exchanging for the ” nine stage kun Peng technique ” and ” ice chain “, Lu Ming went to the divine pulse tower and entered it to cultivate.</p><p>In a secret room in the divine pulse tower, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and took out the first stage of the divine technique of extreme frost. He began to study it in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming only started to cultivate after he had understood most of it.</p><p>It was indeed very difficult to cultivate a divine grade technique. Even though it was only at the first level, it was the easiest. With Lu Ming’s talent, he had to cultivate for a few months before he succeeded.</p><p>After cultivating the first stage, a wisp of divine power of extreme cold was produced in Lu Ming’s body. He immediately started to circulate the universe thousand Dao art.</p><p>Just like that, the divine force of the utmost cold became thicker and thicker. Finally, a divine fire was condensed in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>The fifth divine fire was a divine fire condensed from the divine power of extreme cold.</p><p>The extreme cold divine power was a sacred grade divine power and its power was shocking.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the ultimate cold divine energy alone. With a wave of his hand, his palm was covered with a layer of the ultimate cold divine energy. It was extremely cold. The temperature of the entire secret chamber dropped sharply, and the chill was bone-chilling.</p><p>Even a high-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse would be frozen at this temperature.</p><p>what a powerful force! As expected of the divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was quite satisfied with the power of the divine power of frost.</p><p>At the moment, he had five types of divine power in his body. The power of the extreme cold divine power was second only to the chief sovereign divine power.</p><p>The primal universe was completely different from the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>When he was in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, Lu Ming had mastered many laws. He had long mastered the power of ice.</p><p>However, that power of ice was only the power of ice in the heaven realm and the primordial realm. It was produced under the operation of the heaven Dao of the heaven realm and primordial realm.</p><p>The heavenly Dao of the heaven realm and the primordial realm was completely useless against the primal universe.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had mastered the mysterious laws of fate, s.p.a.ce-time, chaos, and so on in the heaven realm’s primordial realm, they all existed based on the heaven Dao of the heaven realm’s primordial realm.</p><p>As for the primeval universe, it naturally had its own divine laws, which were useless in the primeval universe.</p><p>The power and divine power that one could control in the desolate universe was the Supreme power.</p><p>For example, if the ultimate cold divine power that Lu Ming was cultivating now were to strike the heaven realm’s primordial realm, the entire heaven realm’s primordial realm’s evil G.o.d World would probably be frozen.</p><p>Even the heavenly Dao would be frozen.</p><p>Be it the laws of fate or the laws of time and s.p.a.ce, they were all useless. They were all sealed in ice. This was because this was the Supreme power that belonged to the primal universe and greater world.</p><p>“Continue cultivating!”</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and continued to cultivate.</p><p>The divine fire of the divine power of extreme cold had just been ignited, and its strength was far from that of other divine fires. It needed time to grow.</p><p>Time flew by. Lu Ming had been cultivating in the divine pulse tower for ten years.</p><p>After ten years, Lu Ming finally managed to cultivate the divine fire with the ultimate cold divine power to the same size as the other divine fires and the same density of divine power. Lu Ming’s cultivation level also improved and he was close to the eighth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s abilities had undoubtedly become more powerful. If he were to fight the winged demon, Fengyuan Dao, and the others now, Lu Ming would win more easily.</p><p>Lu Ming did not leave immediately. Instead, he started to store divine power into the ” measure ” formula. When the divine power was exhausted, Lu Ming would absorb the divine power from the outside world to replenish it. Then, he would continue to store divine power in the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>A year later, Lu Ming left the divine pulse tower and headed to another cultivation ground. He began to cultivate the ” nine heavenly kun Peng technique ” and ” ice chains “.</p><p>It wasn’t too difficult to master the ultimate frost divine technique and the ice shackles. He succeeded in cultivating them very quickly.</p><p>In an open s.p.a.ce, large groups of dire beasts charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a place to cultivate a divine technique. This place was within a large array. These desolate beasts were naturally condensed by the large array. However, their combat strength was astonishing and they were not afraid of death.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. With a wave of his hand, a few chains flew out of his body. These chains were completely condensed by the divine power of Absolute Frost and seemed to be solid.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine chains danced in the air and bound the nine wild beasts tightly. The terrifying power of ice was about to freeze these wild beasts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
