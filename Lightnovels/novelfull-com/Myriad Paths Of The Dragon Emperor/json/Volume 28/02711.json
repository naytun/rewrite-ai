These gates of life and death could also be the formation eyes of life or death.</p><p>Attacking the formation’s eye of life could break the formation, but attacking the formation’s eye of death could stimulate the formation’s power and make it even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming was attacking the death array eye of this large array, making the power of the large array even more terrifying. The empty star could not withstand it at all and was severely injured in an instant.</p><p>“Save me, save me …”</p><p>Kong Xing roared in fear, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</p><p>“Rest in peace!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He could not bear to do so. Since he had offended such a person, he had to get rid of him. Otherwise, he would only bring trouble to himself.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack the eye of the death array.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The empty star let out a desperate cry and roared, ” “All of you will not die a good death, all of you will not die a good death …”</p><p>The next moment, the formation lit up. Under the power of the formation, the empty star’s body exploded with a bang, and its physical body was shattered.</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing, the heaven’s favorite who was ranked first on the void G.o.d ranking list of Kong Xuan sect a hundred thousand years ago, had died in this formation.</p><p>“This guy is finally dead!” Yue Linglong heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The strength of the empty star was indeed powerful. If it wasn’t for this formation, even if the three of them joined forces, they wouldn’t be his match. After all, his cultivation was at the third stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can understand this array?”</p><p>Wu Zifeng looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“I know a thing or two!” Lu Ming nodded and did not say much. He then scanned the ground.</p><p>At the same time, the battle symbol art told him the location of the formation core of life.</p><p>breaking the formation eye of life can’t completely destroy the formation. It will only suppress it for a short time. You only have ten minutes. After ten minutes, you must leave the range of the formation, or you will be trapped! The ” battle ” character said.</p><p>“Ten minutes, that’s enough!” Lu Ming muttered. Then, according to the instructions of the battle character formula, he started to attack the living array eye.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>One attack after another landed on the ground, but there was a slight noise on the ground. Those attacks were like stones sinking into the ocean.</p><p>However, the runes on the ground dimmed and then disappeared.</p><p>the array has been suppressed. Let’s take action quickly and take down all the rainbow divine stones in ten minutes!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed towards the altar. He grabbed the dark Dragon blood jade with his palm.</p><p>The purpose of his visit this time was the dark Dragon blood jade.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The dark Dragon blood jade was firmly embedded in the altar. Lu Ming’s grab did not pull it down, but it only made the altar shake.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also rushed over and grabbed a colorful divine stone each. However, they didn’t grab it as it was firmly embedded.</p><p>And this was only because the formation was being suppressed. If the formation wasn’t suppressed, they would’ve been stopped by the formation and wouldn’t be able to do anything to the dark Dragon blood jade or the rainbow divine stone.</p><p>“If we can’t take it down, why don’t we just destroy this altar?” Yue Linglong suggested.</p><p>“Good! Break it!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>They only had ten minutes, so they had to end the battle quickly.</p><p>The three of them took a few steps back and each unleashed their strongest power. Three attacks blasted toward the altar.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The altar rumbled and shook violently. A crack appeared on it.</p><p>It was effective!</p><p>The three of them attacked with even more force. In less than two minutes, the entire altar exploded with a boom. Broken rocks flew everywhere. The dark Dragon blood jade and the rainbow G.o.dstone on it flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved like an arrow that left the bow. He flew out and grabbed the dark Dragon blood jade in his hand.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also made their moves and grabbed the colorful divine stones in their hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the entire cave started to shake. Then, dense runes suddenly appeared on the ground and the walls of the cave.</p><p>Then, a yellow liquid suddenly appeared on the ground.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>When the yellow liquid touched the feet of the three, it made a sizzling sound and wisps of green smoke came out. The corrosiveness of this liquid was surprisingly strong. It should be known that the three of them were covered in divine power, but this liquid could even corrode divine power.</p><p>If it had landed on his body, his body would have been corroded.</p><p>The three of them were shocked and immediately flew up.</p><p>However, the yellow liquid under the ground was increasing in volume, as if it was constantly emerging from the ground.</p><p>it’s the divine transformation realm corpse water, a formation within a formation. There’s actually a formation within a formation here. Can’t you tell that it’s a boring battle? ”</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the quant.i.ty formula shouted.</p><p>“I’m not a professional!” The battle symbol art replied, and the measure symbol art trembled in anger.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll leave first!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>There was more and more yellow liquid here, and once it filled the entire cave, they would be in danger.</p><p>The three of them immediately rushed towards the entrance of the cave. However, when they approached the entrance, a light curtain spread out and blocked them.</p><p>Clearly, this was also a part of the great formation.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted and attacked continuously. However, the light screen did not move at all. Following that, Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng also launched their attacks, but the result was the same. They could not break it at all.</p><p>“Hahaha, you still want to leave? let’s die together and be buried with me!”</p><p>A shrill, maniacal laugh rang out.</p><p>“Star of s.p.a.ce!”</p><p>The faces of Lu Ming and the other two changed. This voice was clearly from empty star. However, wasn’t empty star already dead?</p><p>At this moment, a bright light flashed where the altar had been, and a figure appeared. It was the star of s.p.a.ce.</p><p>However, the star in the sky wasn’t a real ent.i.ty, but a shadow.</p><p>“A remnant soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He understood now. The empty star had indeed fallen, but because he had been trapped in the formation for 100000 years, he had already formed a connection with the formation. After being killed by the formation, a wisp of his soul had fused with the formation.</p><p>“You can’t escape at all. Die, die, all of you will die Here …”</p><p>Empty star’s eyes were filled with madness. He raised his hands, and the runes in the cave shone even brighter. The yellow liquid on the ground rose even faster, and soon, it was a meter deep.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two could only float in the air to avoid it. However, this was not the way to go.</p><p>this is the soul formation corpse water. Its corrosive power is extremely terrifying. With our cultivation, we can’t resist it at all. What should we do? ” Yue Linglong’s little face was a little pale.</p><p>continue to attack that light curtain!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to bombard the light screen. Now, they could only get out by bombarding the light screen.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also joined in the attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
