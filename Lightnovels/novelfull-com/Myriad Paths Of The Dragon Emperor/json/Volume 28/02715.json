They were so shocked that they were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words clearly meant that he wanted to challenge all the experts present with his own strength.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>Many people were roaring in their hearts. If this news were to spread, it would shake the entire outer sect.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s eyes flickered, but they did not object. Their figures flashed and they retreated to the side.</p><p>“Everyone, this brat is too arrogant. In that case, let’s teach him a lesson, shall we?”</p><p>Ying Cang’s eyes turned.</p><p>To be honest, from the combat strength that Lu Ming had displayed earlier, he was not confident that he could fight Lu Ming alone. Since Lu Ming was arrogant, he had a reason to team up with the others.</p><p>that’s right. This brat has taken the treasure and wants to keep it for himself. There’s no need to talk about rules today. Let’s suppress him together and force him to hand over the treasure!</p><p>Fengyuan Dao also spoke coldly.</p><p>The mad scientist, li cunshan, and the rest all stepped forward and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, even the winged howler did the same. It flapped its pair of purple wings and its body was covered in purple radiance. It looked extremely majestic as it appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>They were surrounded!</p><p>There were a total of nine people who surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>These nine people were the top ten on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Except for Kuang Dao, all of them had attacked.</p><p>The others could only retreat. Even if they wanted to interfere, they couldn’t because Feng Yuan Dao and the others were all at the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The top ten existences on the virtual G.o.d ranking list had all entered the true G.o.d-level.</p><p>The nine powerhouses surrounded Lu Ming, who was only at the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Such a thing had never happened before in the history of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>I have to say that Lu Ming is indeed a peerless genius. He’s able to suppress li cunshan with his seventh tier void G.o.d Realm cultivation. His combat strength is terrifying. However, he’s still too arrogant. He actually wants to challenge nine experts at the same time!</p><p>he doesn’t stand a chance at all. Even the divine sons of the three Overlord forces would be crushed under such circ.u.mstances. The difference in cultivation is too great. He’s fighting nine people at once. He doesn’t stand a chance!</p><p>“Not bad, you’re overconfident!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the treasure and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>The winged howler said coldly. If word got out that so many people were attacking him at the same time, it would be detrimental to his reputation. If he could make Lu Ming hand over the treasure, he would not attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming obviously would not agree to it.</p><p>make your move. If you can defeat me, I can give you all the treasures I have. However, since you have made your move, you must pay the price …</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“The price? Ridiculous, you? Kneel down!”</p><p>Ying Cang made the first move. His entire person looked like a golden man. With a move, he appeared in front of Lu Ming and pressed his palm down on him. A Golden Palm print pressed down on Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>He was ranked fourth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list and was even stronger than Kuang Dao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled slightly due to the crazy influx of divine energy. Then, he thrust the long spear at Ying Cang.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Ying Cang’s Golden Palm print crumbled, and the sharp spear light continued to stab toward Ying Cang.</p><p>Ying Cang’s expression changed drastically and he retreated hurriedly. However, he was still a step too late. His palm was pierced by Lu Ming’s spear radiance and exploded.</p><p>“Ah … Attack, attack together!”</p><p>Ying Cang screamed. He circulated his G.o.d Body to recover his broken palm.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Fengyuan Dao and the rest attacked at the same time. All sorts of shocking attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>Only the winged demon’s eyes flickered. He hesitated for a moment and did not make a move.</p><p>With so many people attacking at the same time, the power was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming did not dare to be careless.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming triggered the double combat power of the battle character formula. Almost at the same time, he successfully triggered the triple combat power.</p><p>Before he made his move, Lu Ming had already triggered the tripled combat power. Therefore, the moment he made his move, the tripled combat power was successfully triggered.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear burst out and shot out more than ten spear gleams in succession, clashing with the attacks of Fengyuan Dao and the rest!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out between heaven and earth. Lu Ming was forced to retreat by this force. However, he had successfully blocked all the attacks.</p><p>“Block … He blocked it?”</p><p>“Oh my G.o.d!”</p><p>When the others saw this scene, they were almost scared to death. Their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked the attacks of Fengyuan Dao and the rest head-on. What kind of combat strength was this?</p><p>Even the Fengyuan sect themselves were shocked beyond words.</p><p>your combat strength is only so-so. Now, it’s my turn!</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. A red-gold armor appeared on his body.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine-stage Crimson Gold armor to protect himself. He ignored the attacks of the others and rushed toward Ying Cang.</p><p>Ying Cang was the most arrogant. Lu Ming had to get rid of this person first.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out. The Spear’s gleam was like a mountain, causing the air to explode continuously. Ying Cang’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Attack, attack together!”</p><p>die! Ying Cang roared and then retreated frantically. He kept striking out with his hands. In an instant, hundreds of Golden Palm prints were blasted out.</p><p>However, these palm prints crumbled under the pressure of Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Fengyuan Dao and the rest launched their second round of attacks. However, this time, Lu Ming did not Dodge or evade. He intended to take the attack head-on.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks from Fengyuan Dao and the rest landed on the Scarlet Gold armor, causing it to shake violently as if it was about to collapse at any moment. However, in the end, it was blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear had already hit Ying Cang.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ying Cang let out a blood-curdling screech, and his entire body flew down diagonally. Then, he crashed heavily into the ground, creating a huge pit.</p><p>continue to attack! He can’t hold on any longer!</p><p>Fengyuan Dao bellowed and launched another attack. The attacks continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>There was a crazed look in Lu Ming’s eyes. He continued to block with the Scarlet Gold armor.</p><p>He wanted to use his opponent to temper his Scarlet Gold armor. Only then would he be able to improve quickly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The continuous attacks landed on the Scarlet Gold armor, and a few cracks appeared on it. Lu Ming’s body was also sent flying in the direction where Ying Cang was sent flying.</p><p>At this moment, Ying Cang was lying on the ground and vomiting blood. He was almost scared to death when he saw Lu Ming flying over.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept down, looking down from above and crushing down.</p><p>The ground trembled, and a hundred-mile-long spear mark appeared. It looked like a Valley, and Ying Cang was lying inside. All the bones in his body were almost broken, and he couldn’t move at all.</p><p>Although he did not die, he had lost the ability to fight.</p><p>At the start of the battle, Lu Ming had already crippled one of them. This left many outer sect disciples dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
