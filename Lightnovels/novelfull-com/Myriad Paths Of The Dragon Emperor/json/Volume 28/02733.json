As for the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, it was also approaching the limit of the second stage. Lu Ming felt that he could make a breakthrough at any time.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the frost Jade Ice Phoenix clashed a few more times.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>After such a long delay, an hai and the others had already escaped far away. The frost Jade Ice Phoenix could not catch up even if she wanted to.</p><p>Moreover, after the repeated collisions, although Lu Ming was only slightly injured each time, his injuries had already become quite serious.</p><p>Right now, it was still within the range of control, but if this continued, his injuries would be serious and his origin would be damaged. It would not be worth it.</p><p>“I don’t want to play with you anymore!”</p><p>Lu Ming chose a random direction and cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. Like a kun Peng, he dashed in that direction.</p><p>The cold Jade Ice Phoenix screeched and chased after Lu Ming, its eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>It was obvious that it had been completely infuriated after failing to kill Lu Ming despite clashing with him continuously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two streaks of light streaked across the sky, leaving behind two bright trails of light as they disappeared into the distance.</p><p>“You’re still a bit off if you want to catch up to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and activated the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to its maximum. A kun Peng really appeared on the surface of his body. It looked illusionary, but it also increased Lu Ming’s speed.</p><p>“I’ve broken through, I’ve broken through to the third level!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he would unintentionally break through to the third level of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>The nine heavenly Garuda movement technique was incomplete. There were only seven levels, and each level was more powerful than the previous. Once a breakthrough was made, one’s speed would increase explosively.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming disappeared into the distance in an instant, and the distance between him and the frost Jade Ice Phoenix widened rapidly.</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix was different from the other divine phoenixes. It was not known for its speed. The frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s strongest point was its attack power. A casual attack contained the ultimate cold Qi and could freeze everything.</p><p>Lu Ming had only been able to fight against the frost Jade Ice Phoenix for so long by relying on the divine power of the utmost cold.</p><p>Therefore, the moment Lu Ming’s nine heavenly kun Peng technique made a breakthrough, the frost Jade Ice Phoenix could no longer catch up to him. Not long after, Lu Ming had completely shaken off the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Lu Ming had only been able to fight against the frost Jade Ice Phoenix for so long by relying on the divine power of the utmost cold.</p><p>Therefore, the moment Lu Ming’s nine heavenly kun Peng technique made a breakthrough, the frost Jade Ice Phoenix could no longer catch up to him. Not long after, Lu Ming had completely shaken off the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>“This battle was worth it.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The breakthrough in the nine heavenly kun Peng technique had improved his ability to protect himself.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming found a hidden place and swallowed another healing elixir to channel his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were not serious. He had fully recovered after a few hours. Moreover, the divine power in his body was boiling and he was at his peak.</p><p>Of course, this was all thanks to the ” quant.i.ty ” formula.</p><p>With the quant.i.ty formula, Lu Ming did not have to worry about the consumption of divine power. He could replenish it in an instant after using it.</p><p>“There are Cold Moon Stones in this area. Since we’re here, let’s look for them. We can’t miss them.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and left the place. He headed to the central area according to the map. He cultivated as he hurried on his way.</p><p>They did not encounter any more danger along the way. After half a day, Lu Ming arrived at an icy mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range was incomparably huge and stretched across the world. If one wanted to cross it, one had to cross it.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>From afar, one could hear terrifying roars coming from the mountain range. It was obvious that there were terrifying wild beasts living in the mountain range.</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his aura and landed on the ground. He used his ident.i.ty and rushed in.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not long after he rushed into the mountain range, a huge creature pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a giant lizard that was dozens of meters tall. It was snow-white and emitted a cold aura. Its body was covered in a layer of Ice Armor, which seemed to have amazing defensive power.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thrust his spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out. The long spear pierced the lizard’s Ice Armor, and shattered ice flew in all directions. It made an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming shouted and divine power burst forth. The long spear exploded with a terrifying penetrating power, piercing through the ice Armor and killing the lizard.</p><p>“This desolate beast is so powerful.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself that the ice-armored lizard’s cultivation was only equivalent to a first stage true G.o.d, but its ability was much stronger than many second stage true G.o.d experts and it was even harder to kill.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s ancestral land was filled with cold air. The desolate beasts that lived there were generally stronger.</p><p>After killing the lizard, Lu Ming continued to venture deeper into the mountain range.</p><p>Following that, different wild beasts charged at Lu Ming. Fortunately, they were not particularly strong. There was no one as strong as the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had already crossed more than half of the mountain range.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>A few icy-armored giant pythons appeared and attacked Lu Ming. The abilities of these few icy-armored giant pythons were astonishingly strong. Each of them was not weaker than an ordinary fifth-stage true G.o.d.</p><p>In addition, it had amazing defense and was very difficult to kill. Lu Ming had to put in a lot of effort before he could kill it.</p><p>“The skin and bones of this kind of icy giant python are good forging materials. They can be used to forge a mid-grade divine weapon, soft armor and a soft whip.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment before he took action and peeled off the skin and bones of the few icy giant pythons.</p><p>The soft armor and whips made from this kind of thing were most suitable for strong people who cultivated ice attribute Shen power. Their power would increase and they could be sold for a good price.</p><p>“There’s danger.”</p><p>Lu Ming, who was peeling the snake’s skin, suddenly felt his heart skip a beat. He moved a hundred meters away.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few rays of black light bombarded the spot where Lu Ming had been standing. One of the rays even slashed the ice-armored Python, cutting it into two.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He was very clear about the defense of the ice-armored giant python. Even if he used all his strength, he would not be able to break through it so easily.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, a dozen figures appeared not far away.</p><p>“Unique devil Academy, Liu shangkai.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>These dozen people were from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>Originally, there were 18 people from the unique devil Academy. However, it seemed that there were only 16 of them. It seemed that two of them had already died.</p><p>The person in the lead was Liu shangkai.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the only one left in your Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Liu shangkai said as he swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>“So what if I’m alone?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>it’s nothing. I can only say that you’re unlucky to have met us here. Previously on ice Soul Star, Bing Qing was there to stop you, but now, there’s no one to help you …</p><p>Liu shangkai said coldly, his strong killing intent spreading out without restraint.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, you’ll have to pay a painful price.”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and a strong fighting spirit emanated from him.</p><p>“I’ll be the main attacker. You guys support me from behind and kill him as soon as possible.”</p><p>Liu shangkai sent a voice transmission to the other members of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>The abilities that Lu Ming had displayed back then were too shocking. Other than him, the others were not reliable and could easily be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Only when he stepped forward, and the others attacked from behind, would it be foolproof.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
