Her face darkened. “You two, apologize to brother Lu!”</p><p>Her voice was cold and stern, exuding a sense of Majesty.</p><p>The two young men’s expressions were ugly. They walked toward Lu Ming with their heads lowered and bowed. we were blind before. Please forgive us and don’t lower yourself to our level.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. Holy Virgin Ouyang, let’s work together. I believe that you won’t regret your decision today.</p><p>“I’ve never regretted anything I’ve done,”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang smiled, and the two of them chatted for a while before Ouyang Qingxiang took her leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re getting more and more powerful. We’re no longer your match now.”</p><p>Yue Linglong pouted and said.</p><p>“I’m surprised by your cultivation.”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng curiously.</p><p>Their auras were extremely robust and their cultivation had clearly reached the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>It should be known that when they were in the dark Dragon secret land, the two of them had just broken through to the first stage of true G.o.d Realm not long ago. In just a few years, the two of them had broken through to the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm. Such a cultivation speed could be said to be shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming had the help of the quant.i.ty formula and a series of fortuitous encounters to achieve his current cultivation.</p><p>He did not expect that Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s cultivation speed was not slower than his.</p><p>some time ago, Zifeng and I went back to his hometown and did some ghost-like training. I thought I could far surpa.s.s you, but I didn’t expect you to be so abnormal.</p><p>Yue Linglong said helplessly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. It seemed that Wu Zifeng’s background was not simple.</p><p>“By the way, Lu Ming, Kong Xuan sect’s inter-sect tournament is about to begin. Are you going to partic.i.p.ate?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked.</p><p>I’m not partic.i.p.ating. I’m not interested.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>that’s a pity. If you were to partic.i.p.ate, you would probably surprise everyone.</p><p>Yue Linglong’s face was full of pity.</p><p>Yue Linglong’s face was full of pity.</p><p>Both of them chatted for a while before Yue Linglong and Lu Ming bade them farewell and left. Lu Ming returned to his room and continued cultivating.</p><p>The sect tournament of the Kong Xuan sect was a grand event for the sect because it was a compet.i.tion between the seven factions of the Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>Each sect had many outer and inner disciples.</p><p>In the sect compet.i.tion, which faction had the upper hand and which faction was stronger played a vital role in the future development of that faction.</p><p>Some new disciples would make their choice according to the strength of their faction.</p><p>It would even affect the opinions of some of the higher-ups in the sect, and it would have a significant impact on the future compet.i.tion for the position of sect master for a certain Holy Son or Holy Virgin.</p><p>All the major factions placed great importance on this.</p><p>Therefore, in the past few years, the genius disciples of the various sects had all returned to the Kong Xuan sect to increase their strength and wait for the sect compet.i.tion.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s faction and the transient light Saint son’s faction also put Lu Ming’s matter aside for the time being and focused on preparing for the Kong Xuan sect’s inter-sect compet.i.tion.</p><p>Lu Ming paid no attention to the outside world and focused on cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by, and three years pa.s.sed in a flash. The sect compet.i.tion was about to begin.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that in these three years, Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced another step and he had reached the third stage of true G.o.d.</p><p>At the ancient G.o.ds Mountain, Lu Ming had absorbed the energy of countless ancient G.o.d flowers and condensed the heart of the ancient G.o.d. His cultivation had also advanced to the peak of the second stage of true G.o.d. He was only one step away from the third stage of true G.o.d.</p><p>After three years of cultivation, his cultivation level had finally improved, and his combat strength had increased by another level.</p><p>Of course, his divine body was constantly improving under the nourishment of the ancient G.o.d’s heart. Although the speed wasn’t fast, the effect would be shocking in the long run.</p><p>Most importantly, he didn’t need to spend time and effort to cultivate it, and it would naturally strengthen. This was the terrifying part of the ancient G.o.d heart.</p><p>At that moment, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng came to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you really not going to partic.i.p.ate in the sect compet.i.tion?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked again.</p><p>“I’m not partic.i.p.ating, I have no interest!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>then let’s go and take a look. All the experts from the seven major sects have come out. Many of the experts on the real G.o.d ranking list will fight. It will definitely be very intense. I wasn’t even born in the previous sect compet.i.tion!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s inter-sect tournament did not have a fixed interval. Sometimes, it was held every ten thousand years, and sometimes, it could be held every few hundred thousand years.</p><p>The last sect compet.i.tion had been over eighty thousand years ago.</p><p>real G.o.d ranking list? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The true G.o.d gang, as its name suggested, listed a group of the strongest true G.o.d-level people.</p><p>However, it was completely different from the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>The virtual G.o.d ranking was only a ranking list in the Kong Xuan sect, and it listed the strongest virtual G.o.d powerhouses in the sect.</p><p>As for the real G.o.d ranking list, it wasn’t limited to the Kong Xuan sect. It would be faced with the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>On the true G.o.d ranking list, there were a total of one hundred top experts in the true G.o.d Realm. They were all from the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Without a doubt, this ranking list had a huge influence in the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>Those who could be listed on the real G.o.d ranking list were all top experts in the real G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was also very curious. How was his current combat strength compared to the top experts of the true G.o.ds gang?</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look together!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, he, Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong headed in the direction of the sect compet.i.tion.</p><p>The location of the sect compet.i.tion was in the middle of the inner and outer sect area. There was a vast piece of land here, which was very suitable for the compet.i.tion.</p><p>In the middle of the open s.p.a.ce, there was a huge fighting ring. At this moment, the fighting ring was surrounded by people.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group flew over and blended into the crowd, not attracting much attention.</p><p>“The Tian Hong Saint son is here!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted, and everyone looked in one direction.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked over curiously.</p><p>A group of people flew over.</p><p>The leader was a young man in luxurious clothes. He had a n.o.ble aura and a confident smile on his face, as if he had everything under control.</p><p>The people around him were all elites. They were all geniuses from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>“Is this the Tian Hong Saint son?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Le Zhong was from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>The enmity between him and the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction was growing. He felt that he would have to fight the Tian Hong Saint son sooner or later.</p><p>“The sacred son of reflection is here too!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Sure enough, another group of people flew over from another direction. The one in the lead was a young man in a white shirt and white pants. His long hair fluttered in the wind, and he was handsome.</p><p>This person had an extraordinary bearing. He was the sacred son of reflection.</p><p>The people following the sacred son of reflection were all geniuses. Lu Ming saw Huang Wen among them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
