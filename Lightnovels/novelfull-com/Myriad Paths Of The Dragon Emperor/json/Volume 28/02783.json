It was enough to imagine how terrifying G.o.dkings were.</p><p>Countless people stood in the void far away, looking at the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>That G.o.dking made his move again, bombarding the bronze door.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The bronze door emitted a blinding light and blocked the divine King’s attack. However, it also caused a terrifying vibration.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stood in the void. The ground of the ancient G.o.d Star was shaking. There were even cracks on the ground that extended into the distance.</p><p>Countless people present were shocked by the might of the G.o.dking. They instinctively retreated a distance and watched from afar.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The G.o.d King kept retreating, but it was useless. He couldn’t open the bronze door.</p><p>In fact, bolts of lightning as thick as a mountain shot out from the bronze door and blasted towards the divine King, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“What a terrifying might …”</p><p>At the sight of the power of the lightning, Lu Ming was filled with fear.</p><p>The power of the lightning that attacked QiuQiu earlier was not even one-ten-thousandth of this. Otherwise, no matter how strong QiuQiu’s vitality was, it would only end up turning into ashes.</p><p>“It seems that you can’t do it alone!”</p><p>A voice came from the distant starry sky.</p><p>When the voice had first sounded, it had still been in the starry sky outside the ancient G.o.d star’s atmosphere. However, by the time it had finished speaking, a figure had already appeared near the G.o.d King.</p><p>The aura exuded by this figure was equally terrifying.</p><p>Without a doubt, he was also a G.o.dking expert.</p><p>“You might not be able to open it either!”</p><p>The G.o.dking from before coldly snorted.</p><p>“Try it and you’ll know.”</p><p>The G.o.d King behind him said coldly and attacked the ancient G.o.d gate.</p><p>A terrifying tremor erupted, but the result was the same as before. The G.o.d kings behind couldn’t open the gate of ancient G.o.d.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more experts arrived.</p><p>The major characters of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans arrived one after another. Even the divine kings kept on arriving.</p><p>&Nbsp; behind them, the major figures of the three hegemon factions, as well as members of the Kong Xuan sect and the other sects, had all sent their G.o.dkings.</p><p>Even the ice Soul Clan and the red flame clan had sent their important figures.</p><p>Clearly, the appearance of the ancient G.o.d sect had already shocked the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>However, despite so many forces and experts ‘repeated attempts, they could not break through the gate of ancient G.o.d and enter the world beyond it.</p><p>there’s a formation here. Only an expert skilled in formations can open it.</p><p>A G.o.dking said.</p><p>Following that, the news spread out, and the experts from the Qin heaven Starfield who were proficient in formations also rushed over.</p><p>this formation is complicated. It’ll take at least a few decades to a hundred years to break it.</p><p>Finally, a formation master came to a conclusion.</p><p>“It’ll take so many years. It seems like it’s impossible to open the bronze door in a short period of time.”</p><p>I thought there would be a show to watch. I’ll come back in the future!</p><p>Many people shook their heads and left the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>“It’s time for me to leave. This trip can be considered a complete success.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while, then left the ancient G.o.d Star and headed for the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After a long journey, Lu Ming returned to Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>News of what had happened on the ancient G.o.d Star had spread throughout the Qin heaven star system. Many people in the Kong Xuan sect were discussing this matter.</p><p>However, as time pa.s.sed, the door still did not open, and the popularity slowly diminished.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, most of the discussions were about the sect compet.i.tion.</p><p>There were a large number of outer and inner sect disciples in Kong Xuan sect. Therefore, a sect compet.i.tion would be held every once in a while. As long as one could show off their skills in the sect compet.i.tion, not only would they gain fame, but they would also receive generous rewards.</p><p>The sect compet.i.tion was in three years ‘time, and many people were already rubbing their fists and wiping their palms, eager to try.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not interested in this at all.</p><p>During this trip to the ancient G.o.d Star, a large group of zone Masters had died at his hands. The storage rings of those zone Masters had all fallen into Lu Ming’s hands, and he had obtained a large number of treasures and divine crystals.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not care about the rewards of the sect compet.i.tion at all.</p><p>If he had the time, he might as well cultivate.</p><p>He did not see Qiu Yue when he returned to his residence. Lu Ming guessed that Qiu Yue was cultivating in the divine pulse tower or some other place.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the garden, quietly comprehending the battle character formula.</p><p>Now that his divine body had improved by several times and his battle formula had quadrupled combat power, he could cultivate it.</p><p>As expected, once his divine body improved, his comprehension of the battle character formula was smooth. Not long after, Lu Ming successfully broke through the bottleneck and cultivated to four times his combat power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a strong fighting spirit and his body contained a terrifying power.</p><p>“Four times the battle power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone brightly.</p><p>Now, his cultivation was at the peak of the second stage of true G.o.d Realm. If he were to display four times his fighting power, he would definitely be able to defeat or even kill an opponent like le Zhong.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the chances of triggering a fourfold increase in combat power are still not high!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He had just made a breakthrough. After Lu Ming’s research, the probability of triggering a fourfold increase in combat power was only one in a few dozen.</p><p>It had to be triggered dozens of times before it could be successfully triggered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was full of confidence. As long as he had a deeper understanding of the battle character formula, the chances of triggering it would naturally increase. Just like how his combat strength was doubled or tripled, it would reach a 100% success rate.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and his expression suddenly changed. He sensed that someone was flying toward his courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door of the courtyard and walked out. He saw five figures flying towards him.</p><p>“Wu Zifeng, Yue Linglong …”</p><p>Two of them were Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong.</p><p>There were three other people who came with Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong, but Lu Ming did not recognize them.</p><p>It was obvious that a young woman was the leader of the three.</p><p>This woman was extremely beautiful and could cause the downfall of a city.</p><p>“This woman …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This woman’s appearance was somewhat similar to Yuexin.</p><p>Two young men followed behind the woman, protecting her like her bodyguards.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally back from outside.”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked with a smile.</p><p>“I just came back. Is there something you need?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>my cousin is looking for you. So, we came to find you as soon as we heard that you were back.</p><p>Yue Linglong said with a smile.</p><p>“Your cousin?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the young woman.</p><p>Unfathomable!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first impression of the young lady.</p><p>This young man’s cultivation was unfathomable. Lu Ming could not tell how strong he was.</p><p>come, let me introduce you. This is my expression, Ouyang Qingxiang. She’s my aunt Yuexin’s daughter.</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“She’s Yuexin’s daughter indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>When he saw Ouyang Xiangxiang, Lu Ming felt that Ouyang Xiangxiang was somewhat similar to Yuexin. Yue Linglong also said that she was her cousin, so Lu Ming had such a guess.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
