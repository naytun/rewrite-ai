Bang! Bang!</p><p>Huang Wen’s ten thousand blade waves shattered one after another.</p><p>In the end, the Spear’s light charged forward and clashed with the yellow text.</p><p>In the next moment, all the energy fluctuations disappeared. The long spear in Lu Ming’s hand also disappeared without a trace. Lu Ming landed on the fighting ring, his face expressionless.</p><p>As for Huang Wen, his eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>A b.l.o.o.d.y hole appeared between his brows, and the front and back of the hole were bright.</p><p>The light in his eyes quickly disappeared, and so did his life force.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Huang Wen fell onto the fighting ring, no longer showing any signs of life.</p><p>Huang Wen was dead!</p><p>Most of the people present were dumbfounded.</p><p>Huang Wen was actually killed by Lu Ming. This was beyond most people’s expectations.</p><p>A stage three true G.o.d actually counter-killed a stage eight true G.o.d genius. This was also too exaggerated.</p><p>freak! Lu Ming is a freak!</p><p>he’s too abnormal. No wonder the sect master named him the Saint. His combat strength is so terrifying!</p><p>Many people mumbled to themselves. They finally understood why Dragon Boat Mountain had conferred Lu Ming the t.i.tle of Saint.</p><p>Lu Ming was a freak. Without a doubt, the divine power he controlled was definitely divine grade or above. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to be so powerful. When he became a celestial G.o.d and a Holy Son, it was a sure thing.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The floating light Holy son’s eyes were cold. Huang Wen’s death had caused him to lose a great general.</p><p>“Big brother …”</p><p>ah! in the crowd, Huang Wu let out a mournful scream. His face was as pale as snow, and his face was filled with fear.</p><p>In the outer sect of Kong Xuan sect, he could get whatever he wanted because of his big brother, Huang Wen. Now that Huang Wen was dead, who else could he rely on?</p><p>He knew that his future days would be difficult.</p><p>“Clean up the fighting stage!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain instructed, and immediately, someone went down to collect Huang Wen’s corpse.</p><p>“Who else of you wants to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the people from the seven major factions.</p><p>“Mo Ying, go and kill him!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son instructed a young man behind him.</p><p>“This kid won’t Live!”</p><p>A black-robed young man behind the great Hong Divine Son said coldly. He took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s him, mo Ying!”</p><p>the Tian Hong Saint son sent this person directly. It looks like he’s determined to win!</p><p>Many people were slightly shocked.</p><p>In the previous sect compet.i.tion, mo Ying had displayed shocking power. Although he was not as good as the eight top experts on the real G.o.d ranking list, he was not too far off.</p><p>Mo Ying’s cultivation was at stage nine true G.o.d.</p><p>brat, your strength is indeed powerful. I’m indeed surprised that you could kill Huang Wen at the third stage of true G.o.d Realm. However, your life should end here!</p><p>The specter said coldly.</p><p>Huang Wen said the same thing before. Then, he died!</p><p>Lu Ming’s simple reply made the specter’s face sink.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to that trash, kill!”</p><p>The specter shouted and charged toward Lu Ming. However, it suddenly disappeared when it was halfway there.</p><p>“A speed-type G.o.dly skill? No, this is a secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. A long spear appeared in his hand and he swept it in all directions.</p><p>The spear radiance crushed over, but there was no trace of the demonic shadow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp whistling sound came from behind Lu Ming. The specter was attacking him.</p><p>The other party had unknowingly appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and his divine power gushed out like a wave. With a wave of his hand, dozens of spear gleams pierced out in all directions.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>An explosion was heard in one of the directions, and a figure was sent flying.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s no use. Die!”</p><p>The specter’s figure flickered continuously. In an instant, hundreds of figures appeared on the fighting ring, circling Lu Ming.</p><p>From time to time, a figure would rush toward Lu Ming but he would always be repelled.</p><p>“You don’t seem to be able to defeat me like this.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Suddenly, hundreds of figures stopped at the same time and gathered into one.</p><p>my setup is complete. Lu Ming, go to h.e.l.l. Curse of the devil!</p><p>die! the specter shouted coldly. A thick black aura emanated from his body. His hands kept forming seals. In the next moment, a burst of energy suddenly burst out from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This energy was extremely evil. He did not know when it had rushed into Lu Ming’s body. At this moment, it exploded and formed pitch-black and menacing ghostly shadows. They roared in Lu Ming’s body, wanting to devour his flesh and blood.</p><p>The Fiend shadow planted The Fiend G.o.d ghost curse. This kid is dead for sure!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered.</p><p>The floating light Saint son, the zhixia Saint son, and the others all looked on coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng couldn’t help but feel worried.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>The specter laughed wildly.</p><p>No one in the true G.o.d Realm would be able to break the curse. Even the experts on the real G.o.d ranking list would be in danger if they were planted.</p><p>“Was it planted during the collision?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Previously, the other party had collided with him continuously. Every time they collided, Lu Ming could feel a weak wisp of energy rushing into his body.</p><p>As the force was not strong, Lu Ming was not too concerned.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, it must be the curse of the devil.</p><p>This kind of Devil G.o.d ghost curse was similar to the dark Dragon blood Curse cast by the Dragon Boat Mountain, but its power was a hundred and eight thousand miles apart.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He unleashed his ruler’s divine power at full force and enveloped the demon G.o.d ghost curse.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>&Nbsp; the ghostly figures were like ice that had met fire. They immediately began to sizzle and quickly melt.</p><p>“You … How could you? How did you break my devil curse?”</p><p>The specter suddenly cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“You’re using such an insignificant skill to embarra.s.s yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. His body swayed as he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged at the demonic shadow.</p><p>“Even if you break my devil curse, you can’t kill me.”</p><p>The demonic shadow roared, his eyes filled with ferocity. He turned into many figures and filled the fighting ring.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure suddenly landed on the fighting ring. An extremely cold divine force spread out from his feet and covered the entire fighting ring in an instant, freezing it.</p><p>In an instant, the fighting ring turned into a World of Ice.</p><p>Mo Ying’s body suddenly froze. His feet were frozen, and the hundreds of figures on the fighting ring disappeared.</p><p>“This is … Cold divine power. How did this kid manage to cultivate cold divine power? Could it be that he has already cultivated the ultimate cold divine technique to its peak?”</p><p>“But he’s only been in the sect for a few decades!”</p><p>Many of the inner sect elders were shocked.</p><p>The divine power that Lu Ming used previously was not the ultimate cold divine power.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had cultivated some kind of secret skill that concealed the elemental aura of the divine power?</p><p>But even so, how could Lu Ming have cultivated the divine power of ultimate frost in just a few decades?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
