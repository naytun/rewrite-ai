However, the Kong Xuan sect has offended me. I can’t just let this go.</p><p>Then, he looked at an hai and the others again. He said condescendingly, ” I’ll give you a chance now. Kneel down, kneel down and admit your mistakes, and I’ll spare your lives.</p><p>“What? You want us to kneel and kowtow to admit our mistakes? don’t even think about it. ”</p><p>An hai suddenly shouted.</p><p>It was simply an insult to kneel down and kowtow to Liu shangkai in front of so many people.</p><p>Moreover, if news of this spread to the Kong Xuan sect, they would not be able to live in this world anymore. This was not only their personal humiliation, but also the Kong Xuan sect’s.</p><p>that’s right, Liu shangkai. Every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. Lu Ming has offended you. You should look for Lu Ming, not us.</p><p>The long-faced young man also shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming is from your Kong Xuan sect. He has offended me, and all of you are guilty. Now, kneel down!”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted coldly. The aura on his body became even more violent. Like a mountain, it pressed down on an hai and the others.</p><p>A few of the weaker cultivators couldn’t resist it and spat out blood. Their bodies fell to the ground.</p><p>Only an hai and the long-faced young man were still struggling to hold on.</p><p>“If you still want to resist, get down!”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted coldly. He stretched out his hand, and a huge palm formed. It pressed down on an hai and the long-faced young man. The two of them roared and used all their strength to resist, but they were no match for the big hand. Their bodies trembled violently under the pressure of the big hand, and they fell to the ground like two meteorites.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Liu shangkai looked down from above, his aura growing more and more violent as he pressed down on an hai and the others.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Liu shangkai took one step at a time, and a violent pressure pressed down on an hai and the others.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Finally, someone with a weaker cultivation base couldn’t take it anymore and knelt down with a plop.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The other experts from the unique devil Academy also joined in and burst out with their aura.</p><p>With so many experts, the pressure was even more shocking. The disciples of the Kong Xuan sect could not bear it and knelt down one by one.</p><p>In the end, an hai and the long-faced young man were the only ones who hadn’t knelt down. They were struggling to hold on.</p><p>“Still not kneeling, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted coldly and pressed his palm down again. A huge palm formed and forced an hai and the others to kneel on the ground.</p><p>“Liu shangkai, you’re so impressive!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from afar. Before the voice could fade away, a Spear’s gleam had already flown over and pierced through the Spear’s gleam that Liu shangkai had condensed.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Liu shangkai looked into the distance with a cold gaze. A figure was approaching from the distance. Who else could it be but Lu Ming?</p><p>After more than half a month’s journey, Lu Ming finally arrived at this place. He happened to see Liu shangkai oppressing an hai and the rest.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>An hai was overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and stopped not far away.</p><p>“Brat, you finally dare to show yourself. I thought you didn’t dare to show yourself.”</p><p>Liu shangkai said coldly.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare to show myself when I’ve just been defeated?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in disdain.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At the side, Bing Qing and the others were all shocked.</p><p>A defeated opponent?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had already fought with Liu shangkai before and Liu shangkai lost in the end?</p><p>Lu Ming was so powerful?</p><p>nonsense! You’re just making use of the environment. Now, let’s see how you’re going to fight me.</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted, his killing intent growing stronger.</p><p>“You two, if there’s anything, let’s settle it later.”</p><p>Bing Qing stood up and said.</p><p>ninth young master, don’t worry. I won’t kill him now. I just want him to kneel down and kowtow to me.</p><p>Liu shangkai said coldly.</p><p>“I also have the same intention.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he looked at Liu shangkai.</p><p>Seeing the two of them at daggers drawn, Bing Qing shook her head helplessly and retreated to the side.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kneel down and kowtow.”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared. The lines on his face glowed and quickly covered his entire body.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>A few rays of black light burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body erupted with a shocking fighting spirit. Previously, he had been silently activating the battle formula. At this moment, he had successfully activated the double combat strength of the battle formula.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled, causing the air to explode continuously. A few spear rays pierced through the air and shot forward.</p><p>After a few consecutive booms, the Spear’s gleam and Liu shangkai’s radiance collapsed at the same time. Lu Ming’s figure drifted backward.</p><p>“So powerful …”</p><p>Although Lu Ming retreated, the others were still shocked by Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>To them, Lu Ming could actually block Liu shangkai’s attack. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Liu shangkai bellowed, unleashing all his strength. He pushed his hands forward and a huge black Seal condensed, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The huge seal stirred up waves that filled the sky, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Heavens kun Peng technique. Like a kun Peng, he soared into the sky and dodged Liu shangkai’s attack in a flash.</p><p>“If you want to leave, stay.”</p><p>A pair of demonic wings stretched out from Liu shangkai’s back. As he flapped them, he chased after Lu Ming at an alarming speed and launched a fierce attack at the same time.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly turned around and cast the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A mushroom cloud seemed to have exploded in the sky. Then, Lu Ming’s figure drifted backward.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, Lu Ming was indeed not Liu shangkai’s match. The main reason was that the difference in cultivation level was too great.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you don’t kneel down today, you’ll die!”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s cold voice was heard and he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two figures flickered and collided in the sky. They were so fast that some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t even see their trajectories.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to be defeated!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>After a series of collisions, Lu Ming’s breathing was already a little unstable. Blood was flowing out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Liu shangkai looked down from above. He held a huge seal in his hand and smashed it down on Lu Ming, trying to suppress Lu Ming and make him kneel on the ground.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered, staring at Liu shangkai’s figure. He then performed the air-piercing move and charged at Liu shangkai as one with his spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently from the collision and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body fell to the ground like a kite with a broken string.</p><p>At the sight of this, Liu shangkai’s expression turned ferocious. He flapped his demonic wings and charged at Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was already close to Lu Ming. However, he realized that Lu Ming’s expression was very calm. There was even a sneer at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s heart thumped wildly, having a bad feeling.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said indifferently. A chain flew out of his body.</p><p>It was the secret skill, ice chain.</p><p>As soon as the ice chain appeared, the temperature of the surrounding s.p.a.ce dropped sharply.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
