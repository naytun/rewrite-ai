Liu Feiyu is a first-tier heavenly G.o.d and is the Tian Hong Saint son’s right-hand man. He’s extremely powerful and far from being comparable to long Xian.</p><p>An hai quickly said.</p><p>“First level heavenly deity? so what? Tell me his address!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a commanding tone.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s faction had many heavenly G.o.ds, but none of them could control divine power.</p><p>Only the Supreme Holy Son could have such a person who could become a Holy Son by himself and had divine power.</p><p>It was just a first-level heavenly G.o.d who controlled King-grade divine power. Lu Ming might be able to fight with QiuQiu’s help.</p><p>He had to get back at them for this. Otherwise, he would become the laughingstock of the Kong Xuan sect, and no one would dare to join his faction.</p><p>An hai, Liu Chang, and the rest did not dare to disobey Lu Ming. They obediently told him Liu Feiyun’s address.</p><p>you guys rest well. I’ll get back at you for this.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait a minute. Don’t be rash. I’m afraid this is the other party’s scheme. They deliberately injured an hai and the others to provoke you to attack. Once you attack, they will have a legitimate reason to attack you.”</p><p>Yue Linglong quickly said.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and flew out.</p><p>He could naturally guess the other party’s goal, but the other party had underestimated his strength.</p><p>“Oh no, I have to inform my cousin. Zifeng, come with me!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said. Then, she and Wu Zifeng hurriedly flew toward Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence.</p><p>In a luxurious garden in the inner court, a group of people were drinking and chatting.</p><p>The leader of the group was Liu Feiyun.</p><p>hahaha, this time, I’ve tortured Lu Ming’s subordinates. It’s so satisfying!</p><p>“Indeed, those idiots were really audacious. The Saint said that whoever joined Lu Ming’s sect would be going against him. Those guys didn’t give the Saint any face and joined Lu Ming’s sect in public. ‘</p><p>“They’re just a few dogs who don’t know what’s good for them. Seeing that Lu Ming has some talent, they want to suck up to him. However, they don’t know that Lu Ming can’t fight against the Saint. He can’t even protect himself.”</p><p>Some of the young men laughed as they drank.</p><p>I wonder how Lu Ming will handle this time? ”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>he only has two paths to take. The first is to swallow his anger. However, if he does so, his reputation will be completely tarnished. His subordinates have been abused so badly, but he still has to swallow his anger. In the future, no one will join Lu Ming’s faction. He will no longer be able to compete with the Saint!</p><p>second, if he comes to me for revenge, I’ll beat him up and break all his bones. I’ll make him kneel in front of me like a dog.</p><p>Liu Fei Yun sneered.</p><p>This was their scheme. No matter what Lu Ming did, he would fall into their trap.</p><p>what a brilliant plan! The saint’s plan is truly brilliant!</p><p>“That Lu Ming wants to fight with the Saint. He’s simply courting death.”</p><p>The other young men began to flatter him.</p><p>“Liu Feiyun, get out here.”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from outside. The entire courtyard seemed to shake.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Liu Feiyun and the others were stunned.</p><p>“This is … Lu Ming’s voice?”</p><p>Some people were bewildered.</p><p>that’s right. It’s Lu Ming’s voice. I didn’t expect that this kid would really dare to come. Good, good.</p><p>Liu Fei Yun’s eyes were cold and excited. He stood up and walked out.</p><p>The other young men followed.</p><p>When he walked out of the courtyard, he saw Lu Ming standing alone in the void. His entire body was emitting a cold light.</p><p>“You’re Liu Feiyun?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on Liu Feiyun. Among all the people present, only Liu Feiyun gave him an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>“That’s right. I’m Liu Feiyun. Lu Ming, why are you here? Do you want to lower your head and admit your mistakes to our Saint? Hahaha!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun laughed and the other young men followed suit.</p><p>today, I will break your bones and make you kowtow to my subordinates in apology.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Liu Feiyun and the rest stopped laughing. They looked at Lu Ming as if he was an idiot.</p><p>Break Liu Feiyun’s bones and make him kowtow and apologize to his men?</p><p>Where did Lu Ming get his confidence from?</p><p>“Oh, really? Then why don’t you try?”</p><p>Liu Feiyun’s eyes shone with excitement. He was waiting for Lu Ming to make a move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. A powerful pressure filled the air above this area.</p><p>“They’re about to make their move!”</p><p>At this moment, many figures appeared in the area, watching from afar.</p><p>This area was originally where the inner sect disciples gathered. Lu Ming’s loud roar earlier had already alerted the inner sect disciples in the nearby area.</p><p>Lu Ming actually went to Liu Feiyun and said that he would break his bones. Is he crazy? ”</p><p>he’s indeed crazy. Liu Feiyun is a first-tier celestial deity and a capable general under the Tian Hong Saint son. Lu Ming is too arrogant.</p><p>who cares? there’s going to be a good show. It’ll be fun if one of the Saints gets abused.</p><p>The surrounding people were discussing animatedly. Many people were waiting to watch a good show.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not waste any more time. He immediately attacked with all his might.</p><p>During the conversation just now, Lu Ming had already started to activate the battle formula. He only made his move after he successfully triggered the quadruple combat strength.</p><p>A huge spear radiance, like a mountain, pressed down on Liu Feiyun and the others.</p><p>“This power …”</p><p>Beside Liu Fei Yun, the other young men were shocked. Even a few peak true G.o.d existences were scared. They couldn’t resist this move at all.</p><p>Only Liu Feiyun remained calm.</p><p>“You want to fight me with such strength? ignorant!”</p><p>Liu Feiyun had one hand behind his back. He extended his other hand and struck out.</p><p>A palm print flew out and hit the spear light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance trembled violently before it shattered.</p><p>The terrifying palm force charged towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he was sent flying backward. He only stopped after he had retreated a hundred miles.</p><p>“Is this the strength of a heavenly G.o.d? It’s indeed shocking.”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>Just now, the other party definitely didn’t use his full strength. However, the power of his attack far surpa.s.sed long Xian, who was ranked sixth on the real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>Celestial deity realm and true deity realm, there was a huge gap.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
