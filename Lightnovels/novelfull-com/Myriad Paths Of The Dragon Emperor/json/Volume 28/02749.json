Since I’ve accepted this mission, I’ll naturally do my best. Let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, everyone rushed out.</p><p>In the starry sky outside this road, the powerhouses of the ice Soul Clan and the red flame clan were still confronting each other.</p><p>There were dozens of people on each side. They were all top masters of the ice Soul Clan and the Scarlet Flame clan. Each of them was a terrifying existence. The clash of auras between the two sides made the atmosphere in the starry sky extremely oppressive.</p><p>in my opinion, the ice Soul Clan doesn’t need to wait anymore. You’re wasting your time. Your people won’t be able to get the ice jade cold heart. Even if they do, they’ll all die in the hands of the red flame clan’s chosen ones.</p><p>An old man from the Scarlet Flame tribe sneered.</p><p>it’s too early for you to be happy. Don’t bite off your tongue later and slap yourself in the face.</p><p>An expert from the ice Soul Clan replied.</p><p>“Hehe, still not giving up, then just wait and see.”</p><p>The old man from the Scarlet Flame tribe sneered with a confident expression.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s experts did not look good.</p><p>They had seen the number of heaven’s favorites from the Scarlet Flame tribe and the immortal sword sect who had gone in. There were many of them, and there were many experts as well. If Bing Qing and the others were to encounter them, the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>They were actually very worried.</p><p>Time pa.s.sed by slowly.</p><p>“He’s out!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted. They had very good eyesight and saw a figure rushing out from the pa.s.sage.</p><p>“It’s the red flame tribe!”</p><p>haha, it’s a prodigy from my clan. It looks like your ice Soul Clan has been completely annihilated.</p><p>The experts of the red flame clan laughed when they saw the people of the red flame clan. They all thought that the red flame clan had come out after killing the people of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>Even the ice Soul clan’s experts thought so.</p><p>Their expressions were extremely unsightly.</p><p>“No, something’s not right …”</p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged man of the red flame tribe exclaimed. The others were shocked and couldn’t help but look carefully. They found that the situation was not right.</p><p>The number of people from the Scarlet Flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, and the other sects had greatly decreased.</p><p>When they had first entered, there had been about 150 people. But now, with a single glance, there were only about 50 people.</p><p>Their clothes were ragged and their breathing was unstable. Many of them were injured and their eyes were filled with panic and fear.</p><p>This was the appearance of a defeated Army.</p><p>When the paragons of the red flame tribe and the eternal sword sect saw the powerful cultivators of the red flame tribe outside, they were ecstatic and rushed out of the meteorite area.</p><p>A few of the red flame race’s powerhouses waved their hands and used their divine power to cover them, allowing them to survive in s.p.a.ce.</p><p>“What’s going on? Where are the others?”</p><p>A Scarlet-haired Scarlet Flame tribe elder roared.</p><p>“Dead, they’re all dead,”</p><p>A young man from the red flame tribe answered in a sobbing tone. His eyes were still filled with fear.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had displayed his might and killed his way through. He had almost died in Lu Ming’s hands and was so scared that he almost peed his pants.</p><p>“Dead? How was that possible? What was happening inside? Yan Sen, what happened?”</p><p>The old man from the red flame tribe looked at Yan Sen as a terrifying aura exuded from his body.</p><p>it’s a kid called Lu Ming from the Kong Xuan sect. He’s the one who killed many of our experts. It’s all because of him.</p><p>Yan Sen gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“Kong Xuan sect? Lu Ming?”</p><p>The others were shocked. Given their status, they had never heard of Lu Ming. However, they could roughly guess what had happened.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, a man named Lu Ming had killed a large number of prodigies from the Scarlet Flame race, the eternal sword sect, and other sects.</p><p>However, the Kong Xuan sect actually had such a powerhouse?</p><p>It should be known that those who entered this time were all less than 10000 years old. The heaven’s pride experts sent by the major forces were already the strongest group of people under 10000 years old.</p><p>What kind of person could sweep away everything?</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>The powerhouse of the red flame tribe muttered this name in a low voice, and a cold killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>On the other hand, the ice Soul Clan members were ecstatic.</p><p>It seemed that the ice Soul Clan had won this time.</p><p>I didn’t expect the Kong Xuan sect to have such a prodigy. We’ve paid a huge price to invite the prodigies of the six major sects. We’ve made the right choice!</p><p>“Not bad, not bad, especially the Kong Xuan sect.”</p><p>Some of the ice Soul clan’s experts were discussing in low voices.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, an ice Soul clan’s expert looked ahead. Lu Ming, Bing Qing, and the others were running toward them through the meteorite path.</p><p>“That’s him. That kid is Lu Ming.”</p><p>Yan Sen pointed his finger at Lu Ming, his eyes ferocious.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze landed on Lu Ming in unison.</p><p>“How dare you kill so many people of the red flame tribe. You really don’t know what’s good for you. The red flame tribe wants this man.”</p><p>An old man from the Scarlet Flame tribe said coldly. He stepped forward towards the intersection of the meteorite road. His violent aura exploded and shook the world.</p><p>However, he couldn’t feel it on the meteorite road.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally saw the powerhouses of the Scarlet Flame tribe. They stopped in their tracks and did not go out.</p><p>“Kid, come out and follow me back to the red flame tribe. I will give you an explanation for your crimes.”</p><p>The old man from the Scarlet Flame clan said ferociously.</p><p>old man, is there something wrong with your brain? if you have the ability, come and take me. I’ll stand here and not move.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on a meteorite and looked at the Scarlet Flame clan elder in disdain.</p><p>This made the eyes of the red flame tribe members turn even colder.</p><p>this is the ancestral land of the ice Soul Clan. I’m afraid the red flame clan doesn’t have the ability to take someone here.</p><p>A powerhouse from the ice Clan also said coldly. He stepped forward and stood opposite the old man from the red flame clan. An extremely cold aura burst out.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two’s auras clashed, and the cold and heat collided, causing a violent explosion.</p><p>“No one can stop the red flame clan if we want to take someone. Does the ice Soul Clan want to start a war with the red flame clan?”</p><p>The old man from the Scarlet Flame clan said coldly.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s experts ‘faces darkened.</p><p>An all-out war with the Scarlet Flame clan was extremely disadvantageous to the ice Soul Clan. Was it worth it for Lu Ming?</p><p>They couldn’t help but hesitate.</p><p>“Elder, we’ve already obtained the ice jade cold heart. This time, it was all thanks to Lu Ming. Our clan has been greatly indebted to him.”</p><p>Bing Qing immediately sent a message to the elders of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“What? I’ve obtained the icy jade heart.”</p><p>The elders of the ice Soul Clan were overjoyed when they heard this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
