You don’t have good intentions in coming to ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>The young woman said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, we don’t have good intentions? We’re only here to pick some ancient G.o.d flowers. How can you say that we’re vicious? You released the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain to lure us here, then trapped us with the formation and fed our flesh and blood to the ancient G.o.d flower. Who is more vicious, you or US?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You … You’re talking nonsense, you’re talking nonsense. We, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds, would never do such a cruel thing. Don’t you slander us.”</p><p>The young woman gritted her teeth and looked at Lu Ming with a look of hatred.</p><p>“Could it be that this woman really doesn’t know?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>stop pretending. Someone from your ancient G.o.d clan has set up a formation with the ancient G.o.d flower as the eye of the formation to absorb the flesh and blood of a large number of experts in order to condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d. Don’t think I don’t know about it.</p><p>also, the flesh and blood of outsiders like us won’t be enough. When the time comes, I’m afraid most of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds will be buried with you and sacrificed.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. As he spoke, his eyes were fixed on the young woman, waiting for her reaction.</p><p>The woman’s face turned pale. She then glared at Lu Ming and shouted,”You’re talking nonsense. This is impossible. That formation was set up by my father. My father would never do such a thing. Don’t you dare slander him.”</p><p>so that formation was laid down by the clan leader of the ancient G.o.d descendants.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he sneered. it’s not like you can’t believe it. But it’s the truth. We obtained hundreds of maps of ancient G.o.ds Mountain out of thin air. We found ancient G.o.ds Mountain through the maps, but in the end, everyone died. I was the only one who was lucky enough to survive. Next, the descendants of ancient G.o.ds will die.</p><p>“Shut up! You’re talking nonsense! Don’t talk nonsense! I won’t allow you to slander my father!”</p><p>The young woman shouted, but her eyes were no longer as firm as before. Instead, she looked suspicious.</p><p>“He is not talking nonsense …”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice came from outside the valley.</p><p>The voice had come from far away, but by the time it had sounded, it was already very close.</p><p>An expert, a top expert had come.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. With a thought, the ice chain flew out and wrapped around the young woman, trying to control her.</p><p>However, the moment the ice chains flew out, a terrifying pressure came from the sky.</p><p>The pressure was heavier than a mountain. The nine ice chains were trapped by the pressure. At the same time, the pressure pressed on Lu Ming’s body, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, an old man holding a Dragon-headed walking stick appeared in the valley. The wrinkles on his face were like mountains, making him look very old.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a third level heavenly deity. We’re finished this time …”</p><p>Bone shouted.</p><p>“Grandpa Gu Bo!”</p><p>Seeing the old man, the young woman smiled and ran to him.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, are you alright?”</p><p>The old man looked at the young woman dotingly.</p><p>This young woman’s name was Gu Xing.</p><p>“I’m fine, Grandpa Gu Bo. This outsider actually slandered father just now. That’s right, Grandpa Gu Bo, why did you say he was right just now?”</p><p>Gu Xing was rather happy, but when she said the last sentence, she revealed a trace of suspicion.</p><p>“I mean, what this little guy said just now is very likely to be true. Sigh!”</p><p>Gu Bo sighed.</p><p>“Really? How is this possible? impossible, this is impossible …”</p><p>Gu Xing’s eyes revealed a look of disbelief as she shook her head.</p><p>Lu Ming said that his father had set up a formation to nourish the ancient G.o.d flower with the flesh and blood of outsiders. Later on, he would also use the flesh and blood of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds to nourish the ancient G.o.d flower. How was that possible?</p><p>She could not believe it.</p><p>sigh, at first, I didn’t believe it either. But ever since the clan leader set up that great formation and gave the order to seal the mountain, I began to doubt it.</p><p>all these years, I’ve been investigating in secret, and I’ve finally found out that your father’s obsession is too deep. He wholeheartedly wants the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds to walk on the path to glory, and he wholeheartedly wants to condense the ancient G.o.d heart. For this, he will pay any price.</p><p>Gu Bo sighed, his voice filled with helplessness.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Gu Xing was completely at a loss. This blow to her was really too big.</p><p>If Gu Bo had not told her this news, she would never have believed it.</p><p>However, Gu Bo would not lie to her.</p><p>little guy, you can see the function of that great formation with one look and deduce so many things. It’s not simple.</p><p>Gu Bo looked at Lu Ming, his face full of surprise.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” I was just randomly guessing. Senior, I have no ill intentions toward the ancient G.o.d descendants. I just want to take a few ancient G.o.d flowers. Could senior allow me to leave? ” the ancient G.o.d Emperor asked.</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult for you to leave now. The patriarch has already given the order that all the exits have been sealed. Even if this old man wants to help you, I can’t.” Gu Bo said.</p><p>“All the exits have been sealed.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. This was troublesome.</p><p>“No, I have to stop my father. I have to stop him.”</p><p>Gu Xing called out in a daze, and was about to rush out of the valley.</p><p>Gu Bo waved his hand, and a ray of Shen power enveloped Gu Xing, blocking her.</p><p>“Grandpa Gu Bo, why are you stopping me? I want to see my father, I want to stop him!”</p><p>Gu Xing shouted.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, the patriarch’s obsession is too deep, and the matter is about to reach the final step. If you go over, you won’t be able to stop him. Instead, you’ll be put under house arrest.”</p><p>Gu Bo said.</p><p>“Then what should we do? Was he just going to let it go? If it’s true, then how many of our clansmen will die? he’ll be a sinner through the ages.”</p><p>Gu Xing shouted.</p><p>of course he won’t. If I’m not wrong, the clan leader will definitely choose to take action at the ancestral worship ceremony in a month. At that time, I’m afraid 90% of the clan will be sacrificed.</p><p>Gu Bo said.</p><p>Gu Xing quivered.</p><p>That’s right, the ancestral worship ceremony would be held in a month’s time. At that time, all the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds would gather at the place where the eight valleys converged to worship their ancestors. That would be the best time to strike.</p><p>“During this period of time, I will secretly gather some people. When your father makes his move, we will stop him.”</p><p>After Gu Bo said this, he looked at Lu Ming and said,”Little friend, why don’t you stay and help this old man? only by stopping the patriarch’s evil actions can you leave. At that time, this old man will give you some ancient G.o.d flowers. What do you think?”</p><p>“Alright then!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. In the current situation, he could only choose to agree.</p><p>What else could he do if he didn’t agree?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
