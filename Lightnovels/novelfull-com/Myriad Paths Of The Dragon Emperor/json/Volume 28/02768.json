In the following days, the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region and the domain lord of the Yuhan region sent out a large number of people to search for the ancient G.o.ds Mountain according to the map.</p><p>After half a month of research, they had finally determined the exact location. Then, Lu Ming, the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region, and the domain lord of the Yuhan region led a group of experts and rushed towards their destination.</p><p>They didn’t notice that far behind them, there was a figure following them. This person was le Zhong.</p><p>According to the map, the ancient G.o.ds Mountain was located in the extreme north of the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>On a deserted island in the sea of the far north.</p><p>When they arrived at the deserted island, they were stunned.</p><p>This was because this deserted island was completely desolate. There was no ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Most importantly, there were already many people gathered here. They stood around the deserted island, looking for something.</p><p>region Lord Guan Hao. region Lord Qian … What are you doing here?”</p><p>The elephant Mountain region Lord widened his eyes and exclaimed.</p><p>Because here, he saw many domain Lords, and he recognized some of them.</p><p>Xiang Shan, you’re here too. It seems that you’ve also obtained a map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>A burly man chuckled. He was the city Lord of the thousand region.</p><p>“What do you mean? Did you also get the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain?”</p><p>The domain lord of the elephant Mountain region said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>A scroll appeared in the hands of the city Lord of the thousand region. It was the same as the one that Lu Ming and the others had.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Domain lord Xiang Shan, domain lord Yu Han, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>hahaha, are you surprised? I thought the same as you. I thought there was only one map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. Now I know there are many. More than half of the domain Lords are here. I’m afraid the number of people will increase.</p><p>The city Lord laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming, the domain lord of the elephant Mountain region, and the others were speechless. After so long, there were actually many maps of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Did you find the ancient G.o.ds Mountain? ”</p><p>The domain lord asked again.</p><p>This was what they were most concerned about.</p><p>no, this place is a deserted island. Birds don’t even s.h.i.t, and there’s not even a single feather.</p><p>The city Lord said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened slightly.</p><p>Nothing?</p><p>Wouldn’t that be a wasted trip?</p><p>However, it was impossible to give up just like that. Immediately, they also began to search the deserted island carefully to see if there were any clues.</p><p>As expected, as time went by, more people came from all directions of the deserted island. They were all domain masters who had come with the map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>strange, it seems like all these maps appeared at the same time. Otherwise, how could there be so many people gathering here at the same time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered. He had a feeling that everything was man-made.</p><p>He was not the only one with questions. The others had questions as well.</p><p>However, the temptation of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain was too great. No one left.</p><p>Le Zhong had already blended into the crowd on the deserted island. There were at least tens of thousands of people on the island, so no one would notice him.</p><p>As the days pa.s.sed, more and more people arrived on the island.</p><p>According to domain lord Xiangshan, most of the domain Lords of the ancient G.o.d Star had come. They had also brought a large number of experts.</p><p>that’s impossible. The map of ancient G.o.ds Mountain was made of point soul gold. Point soul gold is rare and precious. Who would spend so much money to play such a prank? ”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Indeed, no one would spend so much money to play tricks on them because it was meaningless.</p><p>The only explanation was that it was time for the ancient G.o.ds Mountain to be born. That was why the map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain had appeared all over the ancient G.o.d Star in such a short time.</p><p>there are so many maps of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. Maybe it is meaningful. Why don’t we take out everyone’s maps and see if there is anything strange? ”</p><p>Someone suggested.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree.”</p><p>Many people nodded in agreement.</p><p>Then, those who had a map of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain all took out their maps.</p><p>Lu Ming took it out as well. There were at least hundreds of maps of the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>As soon as these maps were taken out, they resonated with each other, and the maps became shiny.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, the maps flew out in a certain direction of the deserted island and stopped at a place.</p><p>The hundreds of maps formed a strange trajectory and spun rapidly in the air.</p><p>Runes suddenly appeared in the sky like a spider web.</p><p>“There’s a reaction!”</p><p>Many people were ecstatic.</p><p>If there was a reaction, it meant that the map was real.</p><p>More and more runes appeared in the void. In the end, the void began to spin, forming a pitch-black Vortex. But then, the vortex slowly became clear, and the scenery behind the vortex could be seen.</p><p>It was a divine mountain that was incomparably huge, towering into the sky.</p><p>The ancient G.o.ds Mountain!</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>They had finally found ancient G.o.ds Mountain. In the distant past, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had lived there. Legend had it that there were countless treasures inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>There was an ancient G.o.d flower on ancient G.o.ds Mountain. If he could get the flower, his divine body would be enhanced and he would be able to cultivate the battle symbol art.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Someone couldn’t take it anymore and rushed into the whirlpool. In a flash, he entered the whirlpool and appeared on the other side.</p><p>“I’m fine. Hurry, charge!”</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Seeing that the people in front of them were fine, most of them couldn’t help but rush towards the whirlpool, afraid that they would be one step slower and the treasure would be taken away.</p><p>The domain Lords of the elephant Mountain region and the Yuhan region did not care about Lu Ming anymore and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>Lu Ming mixed in with the crowd and rushed into the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>hehe, I didn’t expect to encounter the legendary ancient G.o.ds Mountain when I came to kill Lu Ming. Lu Ming is My Lucky Star!</p><p>He laughed coldly and followed them into the vortex.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the vortex and appeared on a huge rock.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead and realized that they had come to the middle of a huge Valley.</p><p>This Valley was very large, with a width of more than a thousand miles, and on both sides were cliffs that reached into the clouds.</p><p>They had tens of thousands of people entering this place.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Many people had already rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings and rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a violent explosion in front of them. A group of people were fighting fiercely.</p><p>“The ancient G.o.d flower is mine. Get lost.”</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost.”</p><p>The angry roars made Lu Ming’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d flower appeared?</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly rushed over. Indeed, he saw a dark red flower growing between a crack in the stone. The flower was full and glistening, emitting a strong energy fluctuation.</p><p>It really was an ancient G.o.d flower. It was exactly the same as what was recorded in the books.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
