Lu Ming retreated hundreds of miles.</p><p>However, at this moment, the energy in Lu Ming’s body surged and surged continuously. The energy that gushed out from the ‘light symbol art’ was too strong and extremely pure. It could be absorbed and refined quickly.</p><p>The divine energy in Lu Ming’s body grew stronger and stronger. The four divine flames in his dantian grew brighter and brighter. In just a short while, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached its peak.</p><p>The peak of the fifth level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>“Breakthrough!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and circulated the universe thousand Dao Arts to break through to the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud explosion in Lu Ming’s body. Then, Lu Ming’s aura suddenly soared, breaking through the peak and reaching another peak.</p><p>Sixth level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level had successfully reached sixth-level void G.o.d Realm. His divine power had increased by a large margin, and his combat strength had also increased by a large margin.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The long spear trembled and swept out. The spear light expanded and destroyed the nine fist forces of Kuang Dao.</p><p>Kuang Dao’s expression changed. He threw a punch with all his might and it collided with Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a m.u.f.fled explosion, the sky trembled violently. Then, Kuang Dao’s body also trembled violently as he was sent flying by a terrifying force, retreating dozens of miles.</p><p>“Your cultivation base … How is that possible?”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had clearly been severely injured earlier. He would not have sensed wrongly. However, all of a sudden, Lu Ming’s injuries were completely healed. Moreover, the combat strength that erupted from him was much stronger than the last time they had fought.</p><p>He was already in disbelief. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation had actually broken through during the battle. This was simply a miracle.</p><p>“He must have used some kind of terrifying secret technique. It’s the final radiance of the setting sun. He definitely won’t be able to last long. Kill, kill!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared in his heart. His eyes were extremely ferocious as he charged at Lu Ming again, using his trump card.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He had just broken through and there seemed to be an endless amount of energy in his body. The most shocking thing was that his cultivation level had not stopped increasing. It was still rising and he was charging towards seventh-tier void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The energy that emerged from the ” quant.i.ty ” formula was too strong. Until now, it was still far from being refined.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, air blast!</p><p>A bright spear light pierced through the air and headed towards Kuang Dao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them were like two meteors, crashing into each other.</p><p>Then, kuangdao was sent flying again. His body kept shaking, and a wound appeared on his body, blood flowing out.</p><p>After Lu Ming broke through to sixth-level void G.o.d-level, his combat strength was completely above that of the Mad Dao.</p><p>After Lu Ming repelled Kuang Dao, he did not give the other party any chance to catch his breath. He continued to attack the other party. The Spear’s radiance swept across and enveloped Kuang Dao.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously and exchanged dozens of moves in an instant. Kuang Dao was completely outmatched and retreated.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it …”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared in his heart. He was extremely unwilling. He had come to kill Lu Ming. He did not expect that in the end, he would still be suppressed by Lu Ming. He was so aggrieved that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He began to think of retreating.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed so many of our men. You’re dead for sure. Just you wait. I’ll settle this score with you!”</p><p>After saying that, Kuang Dao began to attack crazily, wanting to escape.</p><p>“You won’t be able to leave today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He thrust his spear at Kuang Dao continuously.</p><p>But Kuang Dao started to fight with all his might. He even burned his Shen power to charge forward. He was about to be pushed out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait. It won’t be long before I make you die without a burial ground!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared.</p><p>However, at this moment, the aura on Lu Ming’s body suddenly rose sharply. The terrifying aura was like Ten Thousand Waves that pressed down on Kuang Dao.</p><p>Kuang Dao’s pupils dilated and he shouted hysterically, ” “Seventh level void G.o.d Realm? impossible! This is impossible! Impossible …”</p><p>He was scared silly!</p><p>Lu Ming had just broken through to the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm, but now, he was about to break through to the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm. The word ‘terrifying’ could no longer be used to describe this.</p><p>It was understandable that he had broken through to the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm previously. Lu Ming’s cultivation base might have reached the peak of the fifth level void G.o.d Realm a long time ago. It was not impossible for him to break through after acc.u.mulating a lot of experience.</p><p>However, he had just broken through to the 6th level of the void G.o.d Realm not long ago. Now, he had broken through to the 7th level. What was going on?</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>In the distance, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were also looking at each other with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>Shouldn’t one’s cultivation progress be done step by step? how could one break through continuously like this?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had reached seventh-tier void G.o.d Realm, and his combat strength had reached the peak. He had completely crushed Kuang Dao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear swept out, breaking through all of Kuang Dao’s attacks and defenses. It whipped his body, causing him to scream in pain. Half of his body was smashed, and his body was sent flying like a cannonball. He spat out a large amount of blood, and was almost split into two. His Qi was dispirited, and he had been seriously injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged at Kuang Dao directly. He became one with the spear and turned into a dazzling spear ray, piercing toward Kuang Dao’s glabella.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Kuangdao was scared out of his wits and retreated frantically, trying to Dodge.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached seventh-tier void G.o.d-level and he was severely injured, how could he possibly Dodge?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through Kuang Dao’s forehead and destroyed his soul.</p><p>Kuang Dao, who was ranked fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, had fallen!</p><p>After killing Kuang Dao, Lu Ming put away Kuang Dao’s storage ring and his spear. Then, he sat cross-legged and circulated his cultivation to stabilize his realm.</p><p>He had broken through two levels of cultivation at once. This speed was too shocking. He needed to stabilize it.</p><p>Two hours later, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s injuries were more or less stabilized. They came to Lu Ming’s side to protect him.</p><p>Three days had pa.s.sed before Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation had completely stabilized at the 7th level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“This” measure “formula is really mysterious and unpredictable!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>A wave of energy gushed out from the ” measure ” formula, which actually made his cultivation break through two levels. If this news were to spread, it would probably set off a monstrous wave.</p><p>“Kid, now you know how powerful I am!”</p><p>The proud voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded.</p><p>it’s indeed powerful. I wonder when you’ll be able to give me another wave of energy? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a face full of smiles. Of course, he communicated with his mind so that Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng could not hear him.</p><p>“Pfft, you wish! I need to absorb a large amount of energy and refine it before I can pa.s.s it to you. The energy from before has been used up. In the future, if you find a treasure with a large amount of energy for me to devour, then I will have energy for you. Do you understand?”</p><p>The unhappy voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded with a bitter smile. So that was the case. However, this was normal. If he could transfer energy to him infinitely, his cultivation would continue to soar and he would reach true G.o.d or divine realm …</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
