He did not expect that cold moonstones were extremely precious treasures even in the ice Soul Clan. Even Bing Qing had a hard time getting her hands on one, so it would be impossible for him to buy some.</p><p>“It seems that if I want to cultivate the ice shackles to the large success stage, I can only find a replacement treasure in the future.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>In order to cultivate the ice shackles to large success, Cold Moon Stones were not the only things that could be used. Other precious cold attribute materials could also be used, but most of them were extremely precious.</p><p>“Brother Lu, if you really want to get the Cold Moon Stone, there’s a way.”</p><p>Bing Qing suddenly changed the topic.</p><p>“What is it?” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>“To tell you the truth, brother Lu, most of the Cold Moon Stones of the ice Soul Clan came from the ancestral land. However, the ancestral land was closed for some reason countless years ago and was filled with powerful restrictions. It took a long time for the restrictions to weaken so that outsiders could enter. This time, brother Lu, if you’re lucky, you might be able to get some Cold Moon Stones,”</p><p>our main goal in entering the ancestral land this time is to obtain the ice jade cold heart. However, we also have another goal, which is to obtain some Cold Moon Stones to bring out.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“So the Cold Moon Stone came from the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He was full of anticipation for this trip to the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land.</p><p>He had to get a few Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>brother Lu, if you can find the Cold Moon Stone in the ancestral land, it’s yours. You can take it away.</p><p>Bing Qing added.</p><p>“Thank you, ninth young master.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks and then left.</p><p>Three days passed by in a flash.</p><p>Three days later, everyone gathered again.</p><p>The geniuses of the six major sects, including the Yimo Academy and the Kong Xuan sect, and half of the geniuses of the ice Soul Clan, added up to nearly 100 people.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan itself had about 50 people. It could be said that all the top masters under the age of ten thousand years of the ice Soul Clan had come.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was naturally led by the ninth young master, Bing Qing.</p><p>“Everyone, please follow me.”</p><p>Bing Qing said as she flew in a direction. Everyone followed her and arrived at a large teleportation formation.</p><p>The territory of the ice Soul Clan was very vast. There were more than 80 galaxies and countless vital planets. Their ancestral land was a long way from the ice Soul Star.</p><p>There were already dozens of figures at the side of the teleportation array.</p><p>These figures were all dressed in white robes. There were men and women, but they were all very old.</p><p>“Greetings, clan elders.”</p><p>Bing Qing and the ice Soul clan’s elites saluted the old men.</p><p>These old men were the elders of the ice Soul Clan. They were definitely terrifying experts.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, right? let’s go.”</p><p>Said an elder of the ice Soul Clan. He stepped into the teleportation formation first, followed by the rest of the elders.</p><p>Why did he need so many experts from the ice Soul Clan?</p><p>This thought flashed through many people’s minds. Then, they all stepped into the teleportation array. The teleportation array flashed and everyone disappeared.</p><p>After half a month of teleportation, they arrived on a barren planet. Then, an elder of the ice Soul Clan took out a large interplanetary warship. They boarded the warship and flew for a few more days.</p><p>In front of them, a strange place appeared.</p><p>There were countless huge rocks floating in the universe in front of him. These rocks seemed to be formed by the explosion of a planet. They were suspended in the air. From a distance, these rocks seemed to form a road that led to the front.</p><p>This was the ancestral land of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The elder kept the Starship and they stood in space.</p><p>However, a layer of light appeared on Lu Ming and the others, enveloping them.</p><p>True gods couldn’t stay in the universe for long, so the light curtain was set up by the elders of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land is in the depths of these broken rocks. Let’s wait a moment. We need to pass through these broken rocks to enter the ancestral land.</p><p>Bing Qing introduced.</p><p>“Pass through these broken rocks? We’re all at the true God stage, but it’s hard for true gods to stay in the universe for long.”</p><p>Someone’s expression changed.</p><p>In front of him, those huge broken stones were suspended in the starry sky. It was no different from being directly exposed to the universe.</p><p>“Don’t worry. This rocky area was formed by the explosion of a real life planet in the distant past. It’s full of powerful restrictions, but also because of the restrictions, the environment of this rocky area is similar to a life planet. As long as you’re under ten thousand years old, you can enter.”</p><p>Bing Qing explained, and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Alright, you can go in now. Bingqing, you have to remember that you only have half a year. After half a year, the restriction here will be strengthened again. By then, you won’t be able to come out even if you want to. Remember, regardless of whether you have completed the mission or not, you have to come out within half a year. Do you understand?”</p><p>One of the elders warned Bing Qing.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Bing Qing nodded, then in a flash, he rushed towards the area of broken rocks and stood on a huge piece of broken rock.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The others moved as well. They rushed out one after another and stood on the crushed stones.</p><p>“It’s indeed similar to other life planets.”</p><p>Lu Ming landed on a piece of gravel and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The environment here was similar to a life planet. There was also air and even divine Qi, but the gravity here was much lower.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing was the first to rush into the depths of the gravel area. They jumped on the gravel at an amazing speed. Soon, more than a hundred people disappeared from the sight of the ice Soul clan’s elder.</p><p>“I hope this trip will be successful.”</p><p>A clan elder sighed.</p><p>The ice jade heart was extremely important to the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>However, a great turmoil had occurred in the ice Soul Clan a long time ago. A tragic war had broken out, and the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land had almost collapsed. Since then, a terrifying restriction had formed outside the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land, preventing others from entering.</p><p>Only after waiting for a long time would the restriction on the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land weaken. Only those under 10000 years old would be able to enter.</p><p>In the distant past, they had sent people in, but they had failed. If they failed again this time, they didn’t know how many years they would have to wait.</p><p>“They’re here.”</p><p>Suddenly, an elder of the ice Soul Clan looked in a certain direction. His eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>The other elders of the ice Soul Clan also looked in that direction with cold eyes.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A huge starry sky battleship rushed over from that direction. As it approached, the starry sky battleship stopped. A group of people appeared in the starry sky.</p><p>The people in the lead were also a group of elders, but their skin was red, and they exuded a scorching aura that seemed to set the starry sky on fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
