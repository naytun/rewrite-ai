Help me gather information. If there’s any news from the floating light Faction, let me know.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Liu Chang nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go and Exchange for our reward.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the mission Hall and submitted their missions. Each of them received 20000 points.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming gave them some instructions and then went their separate ways.</p><p>After they dispersed, Lu Ming went to the divine pulse tower immediately because he had something to do.</p><p>&Nbsp; ever since he had broken through to the true G.o.d Realm, he had sensed some changes in Jing Yu’s portrait in his mind.</p><p>He had not had the time to observe before.</p><p>He entered the divine pulse tower and sat down cross-legged. With a single thought, Jing Yu’s portrait flew out from his glabella and floated in the air.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming circulated his divine power and injected it into Jing Yu’s portrait.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s divine energy was injected into Jing Yu’s portrait, it began to glow. Then, Jing Yu’s portrait seemed to come to life. He took a step out of the portrait and floated in the air.</p><p>“Senior Jing Yu …”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised.</p><p>“Jingyu has long since fallen. I’m nothing more than a remnant of his soul imprint. I’ve told you some things, and I’m about to disappear as well.”</p><p>Startled feather’s Mark sighed.</p><p>“Senior, what do you want me to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. Back then, he had sworn on his life source in front of Bai Ya that he would help Jing Yu accomplish his mission. However, he had no idea what it was exactly.</p><p>your cultivation base was too weak before. Now that you’ve reached the true G.o.d Realm, I’ll tell you everything.</p><p>Jing Yu said. At this point, his eyes revealed a complicated expression, as if he was reminiscing. After a long time, he began to explain in detail.</p><p>“Do you know about the great void Holy dynasty?”</p><p>Jing Yu’s remnant imprint asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“Oh, then where is the area you’re currently in? what star area is it called?”</p><p>Startled feather’s imprint asked.</p><p>“This place of mine is called the Qin heaven Starfield.” Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“So it’s in the Qin heaven Starfield. And you just came out from a small world not long ago. No wonder you’ve never heard of it.”</p><p>The startled feather imprint muttered a few words and continued, the primeval universe is vast and boundless. A small chiliocosm is undoubtedly the smallest. Many experts from small chiliocosm will appear on some vital planets when they come to the primeval universe.</p><p>countless vital stars gather together to form a Galaxy. When the many galaxies gather together, they form a Star Domain.</p><p>the distance between different star fields is very far. To be the Overlord of a certain star field, one is a star field-level force.</p><p>however, above the star sector-level powers, there are also universe-level powers. Universe-level powers usually occupy many star sectors and dominate a region. Their powers are extremely powerful and prosperous.</p><p>The startled feather imprint explained and Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>A star sector-level force dominated a star sector.</p><p>Above the star sector-level powers, there were actually universe-level powers. A single power that occupied so many star sectors, just how powerful was that?</p><p>the great void Holy dynasty is a universal power. They occupy many star regions. If I remember correctly, one of the most remote star regions is the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>Jing Yu said.</p><p>“The Qin heaven star region is a star region under the great void Holy dynasty? Furthermore, it’s from an extremely remote star field?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more shocked.</p><p>now, you should have a rough idea of the power of the great void Holy dynasty. Let’s talk about me. I was originally a Prince of the great void Holy dynasty, ranked 18th, and was the 18th Prince …</p><p>The startled feather seal immediately began to explain in detail.</p><p>Jing Yu was the 18th Prince of the great void Holy dynasty. He was extremely talented and had unparalleled talent. Even in the history of the Great void Holy dynasty, he was a rare talent. At such a young age, he had already become a top expert of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Such talent naturally caused others to be envious.</p><p>That would be the other princes, even the Crown Prince.</p><p>This was because there were many voices in the great void Holy dynasty that called for Jing Yu to lead the great void Holy dynasty in the future. If he did, he would definitely bring the great void Holy dynasty to greater prosperity.</p><p>However, one day, a shocking piece of news came out. Jing Yu, the eighteenth Prince, had actually tainted the current Sacred Emperor’s wife.</p><p>The sage Emperor’s wife was the sage Emperor’s most beloved concubine. The moment this news was released, the world was in an uproar.</p><p>After that, Jing Yu was imprisoned for committing a heinous crime. His cultivation was even crippled and he was sentenced to death. The Prince of the great void Holy dynasty fell just like that.</p><p>As for his lineage, they were either killed or imprisoned. From then on, they became history.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew that Bai Ya and the others on netherworld mountain in the heaven realm and the primordial realm were Jing Yu’s followers.</p><p>“Back then, I was framed. Someone colluded with the Saint Emperor’s concubine to frame me.”</p><p>At this point, shock feather’s eyes revealed a strong sense of unwillingness and hatred.</p><p>“Who framed you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe it’s the Crown Prince, or maybe it’s another Prince.</p><p>Jing Yu shook his head. what I want you to do is to go to the great void Holy dynasty and find out who has framed me. Avenge me. Also, clear my name!</p><p>“But my strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>The great void Holy dynasty was a universe-level power. Any expert from there could probably kill him with a single breath. How was he going to avenge Jing Yu?</p><p>you are indeed very weak. With your current cultivation, you can’t do anything if you go to the great void Holy dynasty. Hence, there is no time limit for this matter. It’s not too late for you to go when you have the strength in the future.</p><p>Jing Yu said.</p><p>“Um, do you have any other divine skills or secret techniques? can you give me some so that I can increase my strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around and he began to ask for benefits.</p><p>In the future, when he went to the great void Holy dynasty, he would definitely face many dangers and risk his life. How could he not ask for some benefits now?</p><p>Surprisingly, startled feather’s Mark shook his head and said, ” I’ve given you everything you should have. The universe thousand Dao scroll and the origin ancient word ‘war’ are the foundations that will allow you to rise. The other secret skills are secondary. Giving you too much will not do you any good.</p><p>“No more?”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather depressed.</p><p>to be honest, it will be very difficult for you to complete my task. Therefore, you will have to experience a lot of trials along the way. Only then will you be able to help me complete my wish. In this world, there are always losses and gains. You have obtained the heaven and earth 10000 Dao chant and the battle symbol art, so you naturally have to pay a little. Alright, this mark of mine is about to disappear. I hope you can complete it. Also, don’t forget to save Bai Ya and the others in the future.</p><p>After saying that, the startled feather seal shook and then burst like a bubble, disappearing without a trace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
