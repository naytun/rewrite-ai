After all, the ice Soul Clan had sent people to the ancestral land more than once in the past, but they had always returned empty-handed and suffered heavy losses.</p><p>This time, he had sent someone in to try his luck. He did not expect that he would actually obtain the ice jade chilling heart. Furthermore, it was all thanks to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had helped the ice Soul Clan obtain the ice jade cold heart. This was a great favor. He, the ice Soul Clan, must protect him.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan elders looked at each other and saw the determination in each other’s eyes.</p><p>this man is a guest invited by my ice Soul Clan. If you touch him, you’re touching a member of my ice Soul Clan. If you want to start a war, then start a war. My ice Soul Clan is not afraid of anyone!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s powerhouse said. His eyes were firm and filled with a powerful fighting will. He did not back down at all.</p><p>The old man from the red flame clan was surprised. He did not understand why the ice Soul Clan was so powerful.</p><p>it seems like your ice Soul Clan is going to die with this kid. I’ll fulfill your wish.</p><p>The old man from the red flame tribe was very powerful. His red hair and long beard fluttered in the wind. His body was red like a burning piece of iron, and a terrifyingly high temperature kept spreading out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the old man of the red flame clan attacked. He threw a punch at the powerhouse of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Ice Frost divine sword!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s expert was not afraid at all. He attacked as well. The bone-chilling sword radiance sealed the entire starry sky in ice.</p><p>The two sides collided fiercely, and the starry sky boiled. Terrifying shockwaves howled through the starry sky.</p><p>“Ice Soul Clan, you’re looking for death.”</p><p>The other strong cultivators of the red flame clan also shouted angrily. They released their terrifying auras and charged at the strong cultivators of the ice Soul Clan like erupting volcanoes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s elders shouted and charged at the other party.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan each had dozens of Masters. They were fighting each other, and the starry sky was in chaos.</p><p>“What a terrifying strength …”</p><p>Standing on the meteorite road, Lu Ming’s heart was beating wildly as he watched the battle outside.</p><p>The strength of these experts was truly shocking. They were much, much stronger than them.</p><p>Any one of these powerhouses could crush him into pieces with a single move.</p><p>Divine realm experts. These experts were all divine realm experts without a doubt. Moreover, they were not ordinary divine realm experts. The weakest among them was probably a peak divine realm expert.</p><p>As for whether there were any Divine King powerhouses inside, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too weak and he could not tell at all.</p><p>This was because no matter if it was a peak heavenly G.o.d or a G.o.d King, they were all much stronger than him. In his heart, he didn’t have much of an idea.</p><p>The two sides were in a chaotic battle, and the more they fought, the more intense it became. However, inside the meteorite road, there was a large formation blocking them. The Qi outside did not affect them in the slightest.</p><p>boy, this is just a small fight. It’s not very strong. Don’t be too surprised. I’ve seen an expert who could shatter a star with a slap. That’s a real expert. However, the power of a real peerless expert is earth-shaking. Tsk, tsk!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the voice of the ” quant.i.ty ” formula sounded. It was obviously full of disdain for the experts fighting outside.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula referred to the unparalleled experts in the chaotic universe. It was too far away from him. Lu Ming’s current goal was these experts outside.</p><p>He looked forward to the day when he could reach such a level. Then, he would be able to travel the universe with his physical body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The battle became more and more intense. An ice Soul clan’s master was. .h.i.t and sent flying millions of miles away, spitting out blood. A red flame clan’s master took the opportunity to attack.</p><p>“Ice sealing the world!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s expert roared. His divine power burned, and a terrifying cold wave erupted from his body. The s.p.a.ce within a radius of thousands of miles froze, forming a huge ice block.</p><p>The powerhouse from the red flame tribe was also sealed in the ice. He was shocked and also burned his divine power to break the ice. However, his breath also became weak. He was obviously injured.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>On the other side, an expert from the red flame clan had his arm cut off by an expert from the ice Soul Clan. Blood splattered in the starry sky.</p><p>The b.l.o.o.d.y battle continued.</p><p>this is the ancestral land of the ice Soul Clan. The Scarlet Flame clan can’t do anything to us.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s expert roared.</p><p>“Do you really want to start a war with us for this kid?”</p><p>The expert of the red flame tribe roared.</p><p>“What’s there to fear?”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s expert replied.</p><p>Although the red flame clan was slightly stronger than the ice Soul Clan, it was still hard to say who would win if they fought with all their might.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The experts of the red flame tribe were also helpless.</p><p>They were just saying that they would start a full-scale war with the ice Soul Clan. They would not really start a war. If they did, both sides would suffer.</p><p>Right now, the situation in the Qin heaven star region was extremely complicated. Although the Scarlet Flame clan was strong and was known as the strongest clan in the Qin heaven star region, the Qin heaven thirteen clans occupied close to half of the Qin heaven star region’s territory. Their strength was even more terrifying.</p><p>Even though there was no sect that could compare to the Scarlet Flame tribe in terms of strength.</p><p>However, as long as a few sects joined forces, or even two Overlord sects joined forces, they would be able to rival the red flame tribe.</p><p>If the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan started a war and both sides suffered, the Qin heavenly thirteen clans would definitely attack immediately to destroy them and take their territory.</p><p>Suddenly, the faces of the red flame tribe members changed. They looked at the distant starry sky. In that direction, there were many rainbow lights flying toward them at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Oh no, another master from the ice Soul Clan is here.”</p><p>The red flame tribesmen’s faces changed.</p><p>retreat. We’ll retreat for today. That brat from the Kong Xuan sect, don’t let anyone from the Scarlet Flame tribe see him when he’s out in the future. If they do, kill him!</p><p>An old man of the red flame tribe roared and started to retreat.</p><p>The experts of the red flame race took the remaining geniuses of the red flame race and the immortal sword sect and flew into the distance in streaks of light.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s experts did not pursue them.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame tribe’s people were very strong. They had King G.o.d Realm experts. If they pursued them, they would suffer a great loss.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the distance, beams of light flew over and revealed their figures. They were all Masters of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“The red flame race’s b.a.s.t.a.r.d, he ran really fast …”</p><p>A brawny man from the ice Soul Clan pouted.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, you can come out!”</p><p>At that moment, someone looked at Bing Qing, Lu Ming, and the rest.</p><p>Bing Qing and the others nodded and flew out of the meteorite road. Immediately, the experts of the ice Soul Clan enveloped them with their divine power.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, did you really obtain the icy jade chilling heart?”</p><p>Many of the ice Soul clan’s experts looked at Bing Qing with fiery eyes.</p><p>“Yes, it’s true. Elders, please take a look.”</p><p>Bing Qing nodded and took out the jade box. He opened the jade box and revealed the ice jade chilling heart. A terrifying chill emanated from it.</p><p>the icy jade cold heart, it really is the icy jade cold heart! It’s exactly the same as what was recorded in my clan’s ancient records! The heavens are blessing my clan!</p><p>An old man from the ice Soul Clan, whose face was full of wrinkles, looked up and sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
