It had been reduced to a blank sheet of paper.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming initially thought that since there was only a piece of white paper left, it would be useless. He did not expect that the white paper would turn into a ray of light and fly back into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, floating above it.</p><p>“Eh? Could it be that this portrait still has some use?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and continued to inject divine power. However, there was no reaction at all. Lu Ming could only give up.</p><p>with my current cultivation, it’s impossible for me to avenge Jingyu. For now, I should focus on my cultivation and raise my cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and put Jingyu’s matter to the back of his mind for the time being. He began to cultivate and then injected divine power into the ‘quant.i.ty formula’.</p><p>Now that his cultivation had increased greatly, he naturally had to pour in divine power again. Although the divine power he had poured in when he was at the empty G.o.d Realm was not used up, it was not enough for him to use now.</p><p>After some time, Lu Ming left the divine pulse tower when he felt that he had stored enough divine energy.</p><p>“It’s time to settle the matter of the chaotic astral River.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a murderous intent.</p><p>It was time to get rid of the nether Hall and the carefree sect. It was time to take back the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>However, before returning to the chaotic astral River, Lu Ming planned to exchange for an interplanetary warship.</p><p>He still had tens of thousands of points. It was enough to exchange for a good interplanetary warship.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately went to the inner sect area, where he could exchange for treasures.</p><p>There was a dazzling array of treasures here.</p><p>Divine weapons, divine elixirs, various materials, interplanetary warships, and so on could all be exchanged with points.</p><p>The price of an interplanetary warship was very high.</p><p>Back then, the celestial warships of the righteous heaven Army were of the lowest grade, so they were naturally not particularly expensive. However, some of the celestial warships were very expensive.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and realized that there were various prices for the starry sky battleships. Some of them could be exchanged for only 100 points.</p><p>100 points could be converted into 1000000 divine crystals. The s.p.a.ce battleships of the righteous Army were of this grade.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was not interested in an interplanetary warship of this level.</p><p>One hundred points, five hundred points, one thousand points, five thousand points …</p><p>The most expensive starry sky warship actually required one million points to exchange. Lu Ming’s eyes widened.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming exchanged for a five thousand points starry sky warship. Its level was much higher than the one hundred points one. In addition, Lu Ming exchanged for two five hundred points starry sky warships, planning to bring them back for zu long and the rest to use.</p><p>Lu Ming also exchanged for some divine pills.</p><p>These divine elixirs were very useful for those below the void G.o.d Realm. They could increase their cultivation quickly. He had prepared them for his parents, Qiu Yue, and his disciples.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming spent a total of ten thousand points. When everything was ready, Lu Ming stepped into the teleportation formation and headed toward the chaotic astral River.</p><p>After spending more than a month, Lu Ming returned to Yunfeng city in the Yunfeng Pavilion.</p><p>“You want to go to the righteous Army?”</p><p>Beside the teleportation array, an old man in charge of managing the teleportation array looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>that’s right. I’m going to the righteous Army. Is there a problem? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m afraid you can’t go to the righteous Army now.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Can’t go? why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>there’s a war going on over at the righteous Army. All the teleportation routes of the righteous Army have been blocked, so we can’t teleport in.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“What? Was he fighting a war? Senior, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>it is said that the nether Hall, the carefree sect, and a few other forces have joined forces to besiege the righteous heavenly Army. The righteous heavenly Army has been defeated one after another, and many vital planets have been occupied. Now, only the righteous heavenly planet is still struggling to hold on. As for the specific details, I am not too sure.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Nether Hall, carefree sect …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a cold killing intent, and a terrifying aura filled the air.</p><p>“Really … True G.o.d …”</p><p>Sensing Lu Ming’s aura, the old man shivered and revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be a true G.o.d at such a young age.</p><p>“Senior, I want to go to the star closest to the righteous Army.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Okay, okay. The force closest to the righteous Army is the w.a.n.g Hai family. I’ll send you to a life planet of the w.a.n.g Hai family immediately.</p><p>The old man nodded continuously. If he had reached the true G.o.d Realm at such a young age, he was most likely a heaven’s favorite of some big force. He didn’t dare to neglect him.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the teleportation array and arrived on a planet belonging to w.a.n.g Hai’s family. He then took out the starry sky battleship. The starry sky battleship turned into a rainbow light and rushed toward the true heavenstar at an astonishing speed.</p><p>what’s that? what an amazing speed.</p><p>“Then … That’s an interplanetary warship! My G.o.d, it’s so fast! What level is this warship?”</p><p>Some people widened their eyes in shock when they saw Lu Ming’s interplanetary warship.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming’s interplanetary warship had already gone far away.</p><p>……</p><p>The battle situation on true heavenstar was more intense than Lu Ming had imagined.</p><p>This was because most of the righteous heaven planet’s territory had already been conquered, and only the righteous heaven Army Headquarters was left.</p><p>Almost everyone else had retreated to the headquarters of the righteous Army, like zu long and the others.</p><p>At this moment, countless troops had surrounded the headquarters of the righteous sky Army.</p><p>The righteous heaven Army Headquarters activated the mountain protecting formation to block the attacks from the outside.</p><p>attack! Break through the righteous Army’s formation!</p><p>High up in the sky, the leader of the unfettered sect, situ haonan, was giving orders. Beside him, stood the palace Master of the underworld Hall, Kang Ji, and a few other leaders.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The experts of the various forces joined forces and launched all sorts of attacks at the righteous heaven Army. The formation of the righteous heaven Army trembled continuously as if it was going to be broken at any moment.</p><p>“This time, the righteous heaven Army will be annihilated for sure!”</p><p>Kang Ji’s eyes revealed an excited expression.</p><p>The ancestor of technique had always been a big threat to him. He had been at odds with him for so many years. This time, he had to get rid of the ancestor of technique.</p><p>His gaze could not help but look in a certain direction.</p><p>There was a gorgeous armchair floating in the air, and a young man in embroidered clothes was sitting on it.</p><p>There were a few young men standing beside the armchair.</p><p>Among them were situ haonan’s two sons, situ Feng and situ Xiao. Besides them, his son, Kang long, was also there.</p><p>They all stood respectfully beside the young man in embroidered clothes.</p><p>Looking at that young man in embroidered clothes, Kang Ji’s eyes revealed a look of respect.</p><p>That was because the young man in embroidered clothes was an inner sect disciple of the unique demon Academy, one of the three overlords in the Qin heaven star region. Moreover, he was also a genius.</p><p>Such a person’s status was so high that he could not compare to him.</p><p>This time, it was situ Feng and the others who had returned to the chaotic astral River with this young man in embroidered clothes. The other powers immediately joined forces with the Walkabout sect and the nether Palace to attack the righteous heavenly Army.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
