Even an expert who could control the divine power of the cold attribute could not withstand it. This made the dark ice Race and Lu Ming stop in their tracks.</p><p>“Why aren’t you guys going up? Take away the icy jade heart?”</p><p>The dark ice race’s Paragon who was fighting with Bing Qing roared. From their angle, they could not see the ice platform and what was happening on it.</p><p>“There’s a terrifying ice platform here, an Kong. The two of them have already been frozen. They’re probably dead.”</p><p>A young man from the dark ice Race answered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The young man from the dark ice Race who was fighting with Bing Qing was called undercurrent. His expression changed. After exchanging a few blows with Bing Qing, he abandoned her and rushed towards the top of the mountain.</p><p>Bing Qing also rushed to the top of the mountain. The moment the two of them reached the top of the mountain, they saw the ice platform and the scene on it. Their expressions also changed.</p><p>“You guys want to obtain the icy jade cold heart? looks like I won’t be able to grant you your wish.”</p><p>Bing Qing sneered.</p><p>“If we can’t get it, you can’t either,”</p><p>Undercurrent responded with a cold face.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Bing Qing laughed coldly, and in a flash, she rushed towards the ice platform.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed but he did not stop her. Since Bing Qing had already seen the two dark ice Race members who were frozen and still dared to rush forward, she must have some confidence.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bing Qing’s figure was standing on the ice platform. However, the moment he stepped on the ice platform, a layer of ice crystals immediately appeared on his body, trying to freeze him.</p><p>“Holy Ice Armor!” Bing Qing shouted. His body glowed and a suit of armor appeared.</p><p>It was a snow-white armor that seemed to be made of ice. As soon as it appeared, it enveloped Bing Qing’s entire body, blocking the terrifying chill of the ice platform.</p><p>Holy Ice Armor, the treasure of the ice Soul Clan!</p><p>Undercurrent roared, his face was very gloomy. Then, his body moved and also rushed to the ice platform. The next moment, his body also landed on the ice platform.</p><p>The moment he landed on the ice platform, undercurrent’s body was also covered in a layer of ice crystals.</p><p>“Ice Armor!”</p><p>let’s go! undercurrent shouted in a low voice. A set of battle clothes appeared on his body, covering him and blocking the invasion of the cold.</p><p>The dark ice Clan and the ice Soul Clan had come prepared. They had brought precious treasures that were now in the hands of undercurrent and Bing Qing.</p><p>Both of them blocked the cold air outside. They looked at each other coldly and then stepped forward, walking towards the center of the ice platform.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The two of them felt as if they were carrying a mountain on their backs. Their steps were heavy as they walked forward. With every step they took, the ice platform would emit a violent roar.</p><p>The people from the dark ice Clan and Lu Ming watched with grave expressions.</p><p>It was strange that none of the wild beasts charged up to attack them at the peak of the mountain. It was very peaceful.</p><p>As for Liu shangkai and the rest, they were gathered together and defending against the desolate beasts, so there were not many casualties.</p><p>On the ice platform, Bing Qing and undercurrent’s speed became slower and slower. A layer of ice crystals appeared on their battle armors and battle clothes.</p><p>It was obvious that the closer they got to the center of the ice platform, the colder it became. Even their armors couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>However, the two of them did not give up and continued to move forward. However, it took a few minutes before they could take a step forward. In the end, the two of them could barely move.</p><p>The layer of ice on their battle suits and armors grew thicker and thicker.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, two cracks appeared on both Bing Qing’s armor and undercurrent’s armor.</p><p>Their battle armors and clothes had been damaged by the cold.</p><p>The expressions of the two men changed drastically. Although they were extremely unwilling, they didn’t dare to move forward anymore. They had a feeling that if they moved forward, their battle armors and armors would be shattered and they would both fall on the ice platform.</p><p>The two of them took a step back and retreated out of the ice platform. Then, they circulated their divine power to shake off the ice on their bodies. Only then did they let out a long breath.</p><p>The trip to the ice platform just now was like a great battle. The two of them had used up a lot of their divine power. They immediately took out a pile of divine crystals and started to recover.</p><p>After a while, the two of them recovered a little.</p><p>I didn’t expect this ice platform to be so terrifying. It’s impossible to obtain the ice jade chilling heart!</p><p>Bing Qing let out a long sigh, her face was filled with unwillingness.</p><p>On the other side, undercurrent and the other members of the dark ice Clan were also unwilling.</p><p>The icy jade cold heart was right in front of them, but they couldn’t get it. They were also unwilling.</p><p>it seems like the ice Soul Clan will have to waste your time trying to get the ice jade cold heart!</p><p>Undercurrent looked at Bing Qing and mocked.</p><p>even if my ice Soul Clan doesn’t have the ice jade cold heart, we are still one of the strongest clans in the Qin heaven Starfield. On the other hand, your dark ice Clan can only hide in the dark and struggle on your last breath.</p><p>Bing Qing sneered.</p><p>This made undercurrent’s face turn extremely ugly. Unfortunately, this was the truth.</p><p>Although the dark ice Clan had produced some talents in recent years, their overall strength was far inferior to the ice Soul clan’s. They could not fight the ice Soul Clan at all and could only hide in the dark and wait for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, perhaps I can give it a try!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly sent a voice transmission to Bing Qing.</p><p>“You want to try?”</p><p>Bing Qing was shocked but she immediately thought of the strange chain that Lu Ming had.</p><p>The temperature of Lu Ming’s ice chain was shockingly low. Even he felt that it was terrifying and extremely strange.</p><p>“Perhaps, I can let him try!”</p><p>A thought flashed through Bing Qing’s mind, and she said, the ice jade heart is frighteningly cold, and storage rings can’t store it at all. It’ll freeze and break the ring, so it needs a special tool to store it.</p><p>A Jade box appeared in Bing Qing’s hand. The jade box was red in color and emitted a scorching aura. On top of that, there were many mysterious runes engraved on the jade box.</p><p>take this Jade box with you. If you can really obtain the heart of the icy jade, you can place it in this Jade box to isolate the icy Qi of the heart of the icy jade.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He could not help but think that the ice jade cold heart could freeze the storage ring. It was quite similar to the ball of cold liquid.</p><p>Lu Ming took the jade box and strode towards the ice platform.</p><p>“What does that kid want to do? Could it be that he wants to ascend the ice platform?”</p><p>it’s ridiculous. Even the undercurrent and the ice Soul Clan can’t reach the top. He must be dreaming if he thinks he can!</p><p>I guess the ice Soul Clan is unwilling to give up because they can’t get the ice jade cold heart. They might as well give it a try. Unfortunately, this kid is going to lose his life.</p><p>Some people from the dark ice Race could not help but sneer when they saw Lu Ming walking toward the ice platform. They did not believe that Lu Ming could obtain the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>Undercurrent’s eyes flickered, but he did not stop Lu Ming. He also felt that it was impossible for Lu Ming to get the ice jade chilling heart.</p><p>He had brought the dark ice clan’s precious treasure, the ice Armor, to protect himself, but he could not withstand the coldness of the ice platform. How could Lu Ming?</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Lu Ming took a few steps and landed on the ice platform.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
