This way, they could avoid being killed by the Ice Dragon in one move. By spreading out, they could delay for a while.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing roared and increased her speed.</p><p>Not long after, he heard the angry roar of the Ice Dragon from behind.</p><p>However, after such a delay, when the Ice Dragon pursued again, the distance between them had been widened to more than 100000 miles.</p><p>Another seven or eight days pa.s.sed, and they were getting closer and closer to the exit.</p><p>However, the Ice Dragon was in hot pursuit, and the distance between the two sides was getting closer and closer.</p><p>If this continued, they would probably be caught up to before they even reached the exit.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, let’s delay the Ice Dragon!”</p><p>“Let me go!”</p><p>Another young man from the ice Soul Clan volunteered.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed inwardly. It was no wonder that the ice Soul Clan could become one of the strongest clans in the Qin heaven Star Zone. They were too United.</p><p>It was impossible for such self-sacrificing behavior to happen in the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>no need. I have a plan. Now that we have the heart of the ice jade, we can use the ice phoenixes to delay the Ice Dragon.</p><p>Bing Qing waved her hand, her eyes shining with wisdom.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. That was indeed the case.</p><p>They weren’t far from the ice phoenixes ‘habitat now. If the Ice Dragon didn’t pursue them, they would definitely choose to go around the ice phoenixes’ habitat.</p><p>But now, Bing Qing decided to charge towards the ice Phoenix’s residence.</p><p>They didn’t change direction, but directly rushed towards the ice Phoenix’s dwelling.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the place where the ice Phoenix was resting.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>A series of cries rang out, and huge figures rushed out from the icebergs. It was the ice phoenixes, and there were nine of them in total.</p><p>The nine ice phoenixes glared at Lu Ming and the others coldly. They flapped their wings and flew toward them.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Bing qingfei was at the front, taking out the red jade box.</p><p>When the ice Phoenix neared, he opened the jade box and revealed the ice jade chilling heart. An icy cold air immediately filled the air.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>As soon as the nine ice phoenixes saw the ice jade cold heart, they cried out continuously, revealing a look of fear, and stopped moving.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing hurriedly closed the jade box, and everyone rushed over. The nine ice phoenixes did not dare to stop them, and they could only watch as Lu Ming and the others rushed past them.</p><p>After pa.s.sing the ice Phoenix’s distance, they continued to fly. Not long after, they heard the roars of the Ice Dragon and the cries of the ice Phoenix, as well as the rumbling sounds of collision.</p><p>The ice Phoenix and the Ice Dragon had indeed come into conflict.</p><p>At this point, they were very close to the exit. Not long after, they returned to the place where they first came in. Bing Qing immediately took out the statue and began to form seals.</p><p>The statue was suspended in the air, emitting a dazzling light. After a while, a vortex appeared in the void.</p><p>The exit had been opened.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar could be heard from afar. The Ice Dragon had caught up to them.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Bing Qing roared.</p><p>“Go, go, go!”</p><p>Liu shangkai and the others from the unique demon Academy rushed into the vortex first, followed by the others.</p><p>Behind them, the Dragon’s Roar grew louder and louder. They could even see the huge figure of the Ice Dragon appear in their field of vision.</p><p>Fortunately, most of their people had already left.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed out of the whirlpool. Then, Bing Qing quickly kept the statue and rushed out of the whirlpool.</p><p>As Bing Qing rushed out of the vortex, the vortex quickly disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the end, they could still hear a violent Dragon’s Roar, and then the light screen where the vortex had disappeared trembled slightly.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>They had escaped.</p><p>Although they had lost some people, they had obtained the ice jade cold heart. The ice Soul Clan members were all smiles.</p><p>Of course, there were also some exceptions. They were the people from the unique demon Academy, especially Hu ya and Liu shangkai.</p><p>During this trip, Liu shangkai was brutally abused by Lu Ming and was even forced to kneel in front of everyone. The thought of such a great humiliation filled Liu shangkai’s heart with killing intent.</p><p>He swore to himself that he would find an opportunity to take revenge.</p><p>“Everyone, take a break and adjust your condition. I’m afraid we still have to pa.s.s another round.”</p><p>Bing Qing ordered.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was still fine, but the others ‘expressions changed when they heard this.</p><p>They had already succeeded, so what difficulties were there to overcome?</p><p>“Ninth young lord, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>Liu shangkai asked with a dark face.</p><p>The mission this time was more dangerous than he had imagined, and he had also suffered great humiliation. He was already in a bad mood, and now that he heard that there were more difficulties, his face became even uglier.</p><p>“Everyone, you’ve heard of the red flame tribe, right?”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“Of course I know of the Scarlet Flame tribe. Who in the Qin heaven star system doesn’t know of the Scarlet Flame tribe?”</p><p>Liu shangkai said.</p><p>you should know that the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan have been enemies for a long time. The Scarlet Flame clan will not let the ice jade cold heart go to us. Therefore, every time the ice Soul Clan sends someone into the ancestral land, the Scarlet Flame clan will send someone to stop us!</p><p>“This time, before we entered, we did not encounter any obstruction from the red flame tribe. It is very likely that they are waiting for us to come out so that they can wait for us to come out. If I am not wrong, the people of the red flame tribe are most likely lying in ambush on this road.”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>Hearing Bing Qing’s words, many people’s faces darkened.</p><p>Next, they had to break out of the red flame tribe’s encirclement to be truly out of danger.</p><p>The only good news was that only those who were less than 10000 years old could enter this road. Only those of the Scarlet Flame tribe who were less than 10000 years old could enter. Those who were of the same generation as them would not have a high cultivation. It should not be too difficult for them to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>Immediately, they all chose a place to sit down and refine divine crystals, adjusting themselves to their best condition.</p><p>Lu Ming also took out some divine crystals and started to recover.</p><p>In reality, he had the ” measure ” formula and stored a large amount of Shen power inside. His condition had always been at its peak.</p><p>Of course, the ” quant.i.ty ” formula could not be exposed. Therefore, he also put on an act.</p><p>A day later, everyone had recovered to their peak condition, and their divine power was full.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing took the lead and walked outside, the others followed behind, raising their attention to the maximum, constantly paying attention to the situation around them.</p><p>Very quickly, they had covered half of the journey and did not encounter any accidents. However, they did not dare to be careless.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Suddenly, Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, from the huge rocks around them, human figures flickered, and attacks were launched at them.</p><p>Fortunately, they were always paying attention to their surroundings and were always alert. With Bing Qing’s reminder, everyone used all kinds of defensive methods to defend their surroundings, blocking the attacks from all directions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
