All kinds of attacks enveloped Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The ice chains swept out to block the attacks while he himself pounced on the next Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The attacks of the dark ice race’s paragons all hit the ice chains and were all blocked. The terrifying coldness of the ice chains spread toward them.</p><p>The expressions of the dark ice clan’s heaven’s favorites changed drastically and they retreated.</p><p>A layer of frost appeared on their bodies, and they were so cold that they were trembling.</p><p>In fact, a few of the weaker ones were frozen into popsicles and exploded with a bang, dying on the spot.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>More than a dozen dark ice Race youths were all shocked. For a moment, they didn’t dare to move forward.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered. His mind was completely focused on the Cold Moon Stone.</p><p>His body flashed and he kept the last three Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to have all six Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>This trip was worth it.</p><p>Not only had he obtained six Cold Moon Stones, but he had also refined the ball of icy cold liquid. Lu Ming had a feeling that the ball of icy cold liquid was not to be underestimated. Its value was definitely above the six Cold Moon Stones.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, the ice jade cold heart is in your hands. Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out to Bing Qing.</p><p>“You want to leave? Hand over the icy jade frozen heart, or else none of you will be able to leave.”</p><p>Undercurrent roared, his face filled with malevolence as he desperately attacked Bing Qing.</p><p>For a moment, Bing Qing found it difficult to escape.</p><p>“I’m afraid you’re not good enough to keep us here.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He controlled the ice chain and flew it towards the undercurrent, sweeping it.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>attack! undercurrent shouted. He slashed his saber at the ice chains.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a few consecutive collisions, although the ice chain was swept away by undercurrent, the terrible chill on it spread towards undercurrent, making his body slightly stiff.</p><p>His strength was already on par with Bing Qing’s, and now that his body was frozen, Bing Qing seized the opportunity to leave a sword wound on his body.</p><p>The undercurrent’s expression changed drastically and he retreated continuously. However, Lu Ming controlled the ice chains again and swept them toward the undercurrent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation was still a little weak. He could not exert much of the power of the ice shackles. He could not fully exert the power of the ball of icy liquid either. If his cultivation could reach the true G.o.d-level, he would definitely have no problem defeating undercurrent.</p><p>However, even now, the chill of the ice chains would still have a great impact on the undercurrent, causing his body to stiffen and his movements to become slower and slower.</p><p>If Lu Ming was alone, the undercurrent could have used his violent attacks to defeat him. However, he still had another opponent.</p><p>Bing Qing and Lu Ming cooperated and seized the opportunity to attack fiercely. Undercurrent could not withstand it and was. .h.i.t a few times in a row. Although his vital parts were avoided, he was still seriously injured and retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, it’s all this brat’s fault …”</p><p>The undercurrent swept toward Lu Ming with a venomous look. Then, it roared unwillingly, ” “Retreat!”</p><p>After saying that, undercurrent turned around and ran.</p><p>The other members of the dark ice Clan also followed the undercurrent and ran toward the other side.</p><p>Bing Qing’s eyes flickered a few times, but she did not pursue. The most important goal of this trip was the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>Moreover, with undercurrent’s strength, if he wanted to escape, even if he chased after him, he wouldn’t be able to stop him.</p><p>“Ninth young lord, here you go, the icy jade heart.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the jade box and pa.s.sed it to Bing Qing.</p><p>Although he was also very interested in the icy jade cold heart, he knew that this treasure was not something he could get his hands on. If he did not return the icy jade cold heart, he would not be able to leave this place.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan would not let him go.</p><p>It was not worth it to offend a large clan like the ice Soul Clan for a treasure.</p><p>If he returned the ice jade cold heart, he would gain the friendship of the ice Soul Clan, which would be of great use to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you. Thank you. From now on, you’re a friend of the ice Soul Clan.”</p><p>Bing Qing was ecstatic as she received the jade box and carefully put it away with a smile on her face.</p><p>“Let’s go back then!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing nodded and rushed down the mountain with Lu Ming, towards Liu shangkai and the rest.</p><p>With the addition of Lu Ming and Bing Qing, their strength had increased greatly. They quickly carved out a b.l.o.o.d.y path and rushed down the mountain, then headed in the direction they had come from.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>They had not run far when a shocking roar came from behind them. It was the roar of a Dragon.</p><p>From a distance, they could see an Ice Dragon Rising into the sky, roaring continuously and filled with a shocking murderous aura.</p><p>the Ice Dragon has awakened? how is that possible? ”</p><p>Someone exclaimed, his face pale.</p><p>Didn’t they say that the Ice Dragon would need to sleep for at least half a month?</p><p>“It’s the dark ice Clan. Those lunatics, run!”</p><p>Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>&Nbsp; it wasn’t hard to guess that it was definitely the dark ice race’s doing. The dark ice Race must have attacked the ice dragons, which was why they woke them up. They didn’t want Bing Qing and the others to take the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Everyone flew at full speed, pushing their speed to the limit. They were like bolts of lightning, streaking across the sky.</p><p>Behind them, the Ice Dragon roared continuously and circled in the sky. Then, it looked in the direction of Lu Ming and the others. It twisted its body and chased after them.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>“I’m finished.”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>That Ice Dragon was a celestial deity realm existence. It could smack them to death with one palm.</p><p>the Ice Dragon was poisoned not long ago. It just woke up, so its strength is definitely not at its peak.</p><p>Bing Qing said, but everyone’s expression didn’t improve at all.</p><p>The Ice Dragon was a heavenly G.o.d. Even if it wasn’t at its peak, it wasn’t something they could fight against.</p><p>However, the Ice Dragon was indeed not in its peak state. Its speed was not as fast as they had imagined. Although the distance between them was closing, it did not catch up with them immediately.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, quickly flew towards their destination.</p><p>However, although the Ice Dragon didn’t catch up with them immediately, the distance between the two sides was slowly closing.</p><p>A few days later, the distance between the two sides was less than ten thousand miles.</p><p>If this continued, it wouldn’t be long before they were caught.</p><p>ninth young master, you guys go first. I’ll go and delay the Ice Dragon!</p><p>A young man from the ice Soul Clan shouted.</p><p>“Count me in!”</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>A few of the ice Soul clan’s young men spoke with determination in their eyes.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>There was a hint of pain in Bing Qing’s eyes.</p><p>If the young men from the ice Soul Clan tried to delay the Ice Dragon, they would definitely die.</p><p>ninth young lord, the ice Jade’s heart is important. The rise of the ice Soul Clan is important. It’s nothing to sacrifice our lives.</p><p>A young man from the ice Soul Clan shouted.</p><p>“Alright, you can go. From now on, your family is my family.”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“Thank you, ninth young master.”</p><p>Suddenly, a total of 11 young men from the ice Soul Clan stopped and charged at the Ice Dragon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
