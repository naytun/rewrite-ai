Have you already finished your work!” Beiming Han glared at him angrily.</p><p>Huangfu Ye immediately shook his head, “No, I will go and complete it immediately!”</p><p>Huangfu Ye really didn’t know what happened with his elder brother. He wasn’t annoyed just now when he was rambling, but why does his mood change now when he speaks about Qiao Si and his first love’s reunion?</p><p>Did he get into trouble again? Arguing with Qingxin?</p><p>Huangfu Ye stood up to leave, he was sure, if he didn’t leave, he would eventually get trashed by his elder brother.</p><p>“Stop!” Beiming Han halted him.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Huangfu Ye was about to open the office door, but once his elder brother had given orders, he could only obey. He turned around, forcing a smile, asked, “Older brother, any other order?”</p><p>“Join me for a drink!” Beiming Han stood up, took his coat and headed out.</p><p>“Should we call second brother too?” Knowing that something had happened, Huagufu Ye obliged, as drinking during the day was definitely not his elder brother’s style—it was more like his own.</p><p>He did not dare to resist and quickly ran to catch up.</p><p>…</p><p>After having dinner by herself, Gu Qingxin returned to her small bedroom. She felt a slight pain in her abdomen, pulled out a bottle of medicine from her bag, poured out a pill from it and swallowed it.</p><p>Placing the medicine bottle back into her bag, she changed into her pajamas and went to take a bath. Warm water cascaded down over her head. She closed her eyes, enjoying the warmth of the water.</p><p>The door was suddenly flung open and before Gu Qingxin could open her eyes, she was pressed against the cold tiles. Opening her eyes, she saw Beiming Han’s eyes, as black as a wolf’s.</p><p>And reeking of alcohol… again!</p><p>The water dripping from above soaked his hair, running down his adamant face, and dripped off his chin, as he pinned her against the wall.</p><p>Gu Qingxin quickly bit her lip and looked away.</p><p>Beiming Han grabbed her chin, forcing her to look up. His lips, reeking of alcohol, came crashing down on hers. Gu Qingxin angrily pushed him away, but he only kissed her more forcefully.</p><p>Beiming Han pressed her tightly against the cold tiles and claimed her.</p><p>From the bathroom to the bedroom…</p><p>Gu Qingxin didn’t know how many times he took her. Although he wasn’t as brutal as last night, she still felt exhausted.</p><p>Beiming Han placed her on the bed, leaned down and kissed the tattoo on her lower abdomen.</p><p>Gu Qingxin lay there, gasping. It seemed as if he was doing it on purpose, imprinting every inch of her body with his mark.</p><p>The next day, Gu Qingxin was going to school when the bodyguard stopped her, saying that from today onward, she was forbidden to leave North Garden under the Young Master’s orders</p><p>Gu Qingxin thought she had heard wrong. Was this Beiming Han’s intention to imprison her again?</p><p>She took out her phone and dialed Beiming Han’s number, but the one who answered was Lian Qingruo.</p><p>“I need to speak to Beiming Han, it’s urgent!” Gu Qingxin held the phone tightly, the anger inside her causing her chest to rise and fall rapidly.</p><p>“Miss Gu, the CEO is in a meeting right now and can’t be disturbed. Why don’t you call him back after the meeting?”</p><p>Gu Qin Xin, “…”</p><p>“I’m allowed to go to the Sheng Ming Corporation at least, right!” Gu Qingxin annoyed, looked at the bodyguards beside her.</p><p>Both of them exchanged glances, but none dared to decide. One of them took out his phone to call Ye Qi, asking for instructions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
