He could sense a cold killing intent from the two young men.</p><p>“The person who will kill you.”</p><p>A young man with two bull horns on his head said coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, in a flash, he appeared behind Lu Ming, blocking his way of retreat.</p><p>“You’re the disciples of the Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he asked.</p><p>hehe, at least you’re smart. I’ll let you die in peace. That’s right, we’re inner disciples of the Kong Xuan sect and belong to the sacred son of reflection’s faction. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The bull-horned young man said coldly.</p><p>sacred son of reflection’s faction, it’s really you guys.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his body exuding a cold murderous intent.</p><p>There were only two sects in the Kong Xuan sect that wanted to kill him. One was the fu Guang sect and the other was the Tian Hong sect.</p><p>brat, you even have killing intent towards us. With your cultivation of only stage one true G.o.d, you want to kill us? this is simply laughable.</p><p>The bull-horned young man sneered and stepped forward, his violent aura soaring into the sky.</p><p>Seventh stage true G.o.d!</p><p>The bull-horned young man was at the seventh stage of true G.o.d Realm and the divine power he controlled was King grade divine power. His fighting power was enough to fight against an ordinary eighth stage true G.o.d.</p><p>At the same time, the other youth also burst out with a terrifying aura. He was also at the seventh stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Two heaven’s favorites at the seventh stage of the true G.o.d Realm came to kill a person at the first stage of the true G.o.d Realm. No matter how heaven’s favorites this person was, it was a sure thing.</p><p>Because the difference was too great.</p><p>It was no wonder that they found it ridiculous that Lu Ming had the intention to kill them.</p><p>“Kid, I’ll send you on your way. Remember, the one who killed you is Niu Fen!”</p><p>The bull-horned young man took a thousand steps and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? Cow dung?”</p><p>Lu Ming almost laughed out loud when he heard the name.</p><p>That was a really good name.</p><p>However, before Lu Ming could think further, the other party’s fist force was already pressing down on him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he thrust it forward.</p><p>In the process of stabbing, Lu Ming had already exploded with three times his combat strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear and the fist force collided, creating a violent boom and overflowing energy.</p><p>The bull-horned young man retreated a dozen steps, while Lu Ming’s body only swayed a little.</p><p>“How is that possible? Your battle strength …”</p><p>The bull-horned young man’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming had the upper hand in a head-on collision?</p><p>How could a first stage true G.o.d possibly have such powerful combat power?</p><p>The other young man, who had a relaxed expression, was no longer relaxed. His face was filled with solemness. Clearly, Lu Ming’s attack had frightened them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The bull-horned young man bellowed. A battle-ax appeared in his hand and he slashed it at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>The bull-horned young man had already used his divine skill.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming also used his G.o.dly skill.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>This time, the bull-horned young man’s body shook violently, and he was forced to retreat again.</p><p>Even after using the divine skill, he was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>ah, d.a.m.n it! Quick, attack together! Attack together!</p><p>The bull-horned young man roared.</p><p>The other young man had already made his move. His figure flashed and he pounced at Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed. A brilliant sword light burst out and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his spear again. This time, two spearlights burst out and attacked the other party.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two sides continued to exchange blows. The three figures flickered in the air at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>To be honest, the bull-horned young man and the other man were both very strong. They were at stage seven of true G.o.d Realm and had King-grade divine power. Even one of their divine skills had been cultivated to stage four.</p><p>With the two of them working together, it would not be easy even for Lu Ming to take them down.</p><p>After exchanging dozens of moves, although Lu Ming had the upper hand, he could not completely crush them.</p><p>this man is too powerful. Let’s retreat and report this to the Saint so that he can send more powerful people to kill this kid.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The bull-horned young man and the other young man conversed in secret. Their eyes were filled with deep fear.</p><p>A first-stage true G.o.d was actually able to suppress the two of them when they joined forces. Such a monster was simply unheard of. Even those Holy Sons were far inferior to Lu Ming in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Although those Saints were powerful, there was a limit. However, Lu Ming was simply a freak.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two of them quickly retreated, trying to escape.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Then, with a thought, eight chains flew out of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>That’s right, there were eight chains. Lu Ming did not use his full strength. He did not use the most terrifying chain.</p><p>However, these eight ice chains had all been refined into Cold Moon Stones, so their power was equally shocking.</p><p>As soon as the ice chains appeared, they were like eight long snakes, dancing in the sky and winding toward the bull-horned young man and the other man.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The bull-horned young man and the other man attacked crazily, trying to break the ice chains. However, when their attacks landed on the ice chains, they were completely unharmed.</p><p>On the contrary, a terrifying chill spread out from the ice chains and entered the bodies of the bull-horned young man and the other man through the divine artifact. The two of them shivered and a layer of frost appeared on the surface of their bodies, trying to seal them in ice.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The bull-horned young man and the other young man shouted with all their might, but it was to no avail.</p><p>They couldn’t break the ice chains at all. The ice chains contracted and became tighter and tighter. In the end, they wrapped around the bull-horned young man and the other man tightly, making them unable to move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He thrust his spear forward and killed the bull-horned young man and his companion. He waved his hand and kept their storage rings.</p><p>“The sacred son of reflection!”</p><p>The cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified.</p><p>These two factions had tried to kill him time and time again. In his heart, he had already been sentenced to death. He would destroy these two factions sooner or later.</p><p>if I go all out now, it would be equivalent to a heaven’s favorite at the eighth stage of true G.o.d Realm …</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming had a rough estimate of his abilities.</p><p>If he used all his means now, he was probably comparable to an eighth stage true G.o.d who controlled King-grade divine power. If he only controlled ordinary divine power, Lu Ming could even fight against a ninth stage true G.o.d.</p><p>Fighting a stage nine true G.o.d as a stage one true G.o.d, if it was spread out, it would probably scare people to death.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming left the place.</p><p>Shortly after Lu Ming left, le Zhong’s figure appeared there.</p><p>At this moment, le Zhong’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>In fact, he had seen the entire battle just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had deeply shocked him.</p><p>too terrifying! This kid’s combat strength is too terrifying!</p><p>He mumbled to himself. As he recalled the battle just now, the fear in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>A stage one true G.o.d could actually kill two stage seven true G.o.d geniuses. If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t believe it even if he was beaten to death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
