The entire Ice Mountain trembled, and a vast Dragon’s might filled the air. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest all concealed their auras and did not dare to move.</p><p>The celestial deity realm was too powerful. It was far from what they could fight against. He could probably annihilate them all in one move.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The Ice Dragon rose and stomped on the ground, causing the earth to rumble.</p><p>The ice dragons ‘gazes immediately locked onto the cold heart gra.s.s. With a twist of their bodies, they arrived near the cold heart gra.s.s.</p><p>However, a look of doubt flashed in their eyes.</p><p>The ice dragons were confused as to why a few stalks of cold heart gra.s.s would suddenly appear here. However, even though they were confused, they still could not resist the temptation of the cold heart gra.s.s. They opened their big mouths and each Ice Dragon swallowed one stalk of cold heart gra.s.s. They looked like they were enjoying it.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Bing Qing was overjoyed and stared at the ice dragons.</p><p>After the ice dragons finished eating the cold heart gra.s.s, they turned around and walked back. However, as they walked, their bodies began to stagger as if they were drunk. In the end, they fell to the ground with a few thumps and fell asleep.</p><p>it’s a success! The Ice Dragon is unconscious!</p><p>Someone called out in surprise.</p><p>everyone, let’s set off. These ice dragons will definitely not wake up in half a month.</p><p>Bing Qing smiled and took the lead to rush towards the ice Mountain.</p><p>The others followed.</p><p>Sure enough, when they approached the Ice Dragon, the Ice Dragon didn’t react at all and was still sleeping.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a ray of sword light burst out. A young man actually stabbed his sword at the neck of an Ice Dragon.</p><p>However, the sword stabbed into the Ice Dragon’s neck, making a crisp sound and sending sparks everywhere. However, the Ice Dragon was not hurt at all.</p><p>“What are you doing? Do you want to die? if you wake up the Ice Dragon, we’ll all die!”</p><p>Bing Qing shouted, her face was extremely ugly as she stared at one of the young men.</p><p>That person was a genius from the unique devil Academy, and his eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>It was obvious that this person wanted to kill the Ice Dragon and obtain its corpse.</p><p>This Ice Dragon was a heavenly G.o.d-level existence. Everything on its body was a treasure. If it was brought out, it would be worth cities.</p><p>Unfortunately, the heavenly G.o.d Ice Dragon’s defense was too strong. Even if it lay there without moving, he could not break the defense.</p><p>The young man’s expression changed after being scolded by Bing Qing.</p><p>“Don’t act rashly. We can’t kill a heavenly G.o.d Ice Dragon.”</p><p>Liu shangkai also spoke.</p><p>In fact, many people had the same thought just now. They wanted to kill the Ice Dragon, but now, no one dared to do so.</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s defense was too strong. If they couldn’t kill it in one move and only injured it, they would probably all die.</p><p>“If anyone does such a stupid thing again, don’t blame me for being merciless.”</p><p>Bing Qing warned before continuing forward.</p><p>Soon, they pa.s.sed by a few ice dragons and arrived at the foot of the ice Mountain.</p><p>When they came here, they felt that the world was filled with a powerful pressure that pressed down on them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing was the first to rush up the ice Mountain.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>They had only rushed out a few thousand meters when a series of roars came from the iceberg. The rocks that originally looked like ice stones suddenly moved and turned into desolate beasts.</p><p>It turned out that many of the ice rocks were formed from desolate beasts. Now that they had come up, they immediately alarmed these desolate beasts.</p><p>Among these dire beasts, there were ice-armored lizards, ice-armored pythons, ice-armored giant Bulls, and so on. All of them were covered in Ice Armor as they roared and charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Bing Qing was the first to charge forward, sword light burst forth, and in an instant, three desolate beasts were split in half.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and pierced through one of the Bulls, killing it on the spot.</p><p>These wild beasts weren’t too strong. Most of them were at peak ethereal G.o.d Realm, and some were at the first or second stage of true G.o.d Realm. It wasn’t too hard to kill them.</p><p>They gathered together in the shape of an awl and quickly advanced towards the top of the ice Mountain.</p><p>However, as they continued to move up, the desolate beasts that appeared became stronger and stronger, and more and more difficult to kill.</p><p>Gradually, there were almost no virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts left. The ones that appeared were almost all true G.o.d-level wild beasts.</p><p>Their speed was getting slower and slower.</p><p>Bing Qing was still fearless and invincible. Every move she made would kill a desolate beast.</p><p>In addition, Liu shangkai was also very strong. With a wave of his hand, rays of black light burst out, killing a stage three true G.o.d desolate beast.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and pulled it out, splitting a third-stage true G.o.d-level ice-armored giant python into two.</p><p>With the three of them paving the way and the cooperation of the others, although their speed had slowed down, they were still slowly moving upwards, slowly approaching the peak of the mountain.</p><p>If they continued, it wouldn’t be long before they reached the peak of the mountain.</p><p>However, at this moment, a change occurred.</p><p>From a place even further away, waves of beast roars suddenly came. Then, the mountain rumbled and large groups of desolate beasts rushed over.</p><p>There were some on the left and right, and in front of these wild beasts, there were a few figures moving rapidly.</p><p>With one look, one could tell that those few figures were not wild beasts, but … The ice Soul Clan.</p><p>Yes, she looked very similar to the ice Soul Clan. She had long, white hair and white eyes …</p><p>The only difference was that their skin was slightly darker.</p><p>“Dark ice Clan! d.a.m.n it! It’s the dark ice Clan!”</p><p>“How did they enter the ancestral land?”</p><p>A few of the ice Soul clan’s geniuses roared immediately.</p><p>“Dark ice Clan? What’s the dark ice Clan?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s elites all looked gloomy.</p><p>let me explain. The dark ice Clan was originally a member of the ice Soul Clan in the distant past. However, the dark ice Clan was later declared to be the ice Soul Clan and started an internal war. The war was extremely brutal. In the end, the ancestral land of the ice Soul Clan was blown up, and our strength was greatly reduced!</p><p>in the end, the dark ice Clan was defeated, and the remaining people went into hiding. They’ve been fighting against the ice Soul Clan in secret all these years!</p><p>Bing Qing quickly explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he understood many things.</p><p>He had heard that the ice Soul Clan used to be very powerful, but after a shocking war broke out, their ancestral land collapsed, and their strength declined a lot. They were no match for the red flame clan.</p><p>In the distant past, the ice Soul clan’s strength was above the Scarlet Flame clan. It was the true number one force in the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>It turned out that there was a civil war.</p><p>in the past, the dark ice Race couldn’t enter the ancestral land without the ancestral token. This time, they can enter the ancestral land and have been hiding in the dark for a long time!</p><p>Bing Qing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Everyone understood what Bing Qing meant. It was obvious that the dark ice Race had entered earlier than them, but they should not have been able to deal with the Ice Dragon. They were hiding in the dark. After they had defeated the Ice Dragon and killed their way up to the mountain peak, they would then appear and attract other wild beasts to attack Lu Ming and the rest. They would then reap the benefits without doing anything.</p><p>“You want to obtain the ice jade chilling heart? impossible! Go to h.e.l.l!”</p><p>A young man of the dark ice Clan laughed eerily and dashed toward them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
