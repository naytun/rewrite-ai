He stopped and no longer pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ying Cang, you’re early. What’s up? Did you find anything?”</p><p>Fengyuan Dao’s gaze looked towards Ying Cang, and a strange light flickered in his eyes.</p><p>It was obvious that Fengyuan Dao suspected that Ying Cang had obtained something.</p><p>Ying Cang’s expression changed. He forced out a smile and said, ” “Brother Feng must be joking, how could I have gained anything? I also just arrived, but these few people just came out of the mountain, I’m interrogating them!”</p><p>Facing Fengyuan Dao, Ying Cang didn’t dare to offend him.</p><p>This was because the other party’s background was not inferior to his at all. At the same time, his combat strength was above his. He had fought with Feng Yuan Dao a few times in the past and lost miserably every time.</p><p>When he was at the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm, Ying Cang only had the experience of defeating a true G.o.d Realm expert. However, Feng Yuan Dao had the battle record of killing a true G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>Defeating and killing were two completely different things.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>When Fengyuan Dao heard this, he turned to look at Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng.</p><p>When he saw Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng, his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Because Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s cultivation base were also at the first stage of true G.o.d Realm, it was obvious that Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong were the same as them, breaking through after entering the dark Dragon secret realm. To be able to do this, they were definitely experts among experts.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming, a virtual G.o.d-level, was directly ignored by him.</p><p>“How may I address the two of you?”</p><p>Fengyuan Dao cupped his fists at Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“Yue Linglong!”</p><p>“Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng answered.</p><p>Fengyuan Dao, madman, li cunshan, Ying Cang, and the others all frowned, because they had never heard of these two names in the outer sect.</p><p>“Guys, what did you get inside?”</p><p>Fengyuan Dao narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p>“What did we get? This has nothing to do with you!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>what do you mean by unrelated? don’t you know that everyone who sees it has a share? ”</p><p>Ying Cang berated, causing Yue Linglong to frown.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain suddenly exploded with a loud boom.</p><p>The mountain peak exploded, and gravel flew everywhere. There was also divine transformation realm corpse water.</p><p>“Not good, quickly Dodge!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Together with Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng, they dodged the splashing divine transformation realm corpse water.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>However, there were still people who were splashed by the soul formation corpse water. Their bodies were corroded, and they let out shrill screams. However, after a few moments, the screams stopped abruptly because their entire bodies had been corroded to the point that not even a residue was left.</p><p>The others were shocked and tried to Dodge.</p><p>After everything had calmed down, everyone stopped with lingering fear. However, at least five or six outer sect disciples had died under the soul formation corpse water just now.</p><p>you guys are so vicious. You knew that there was danger inside, but you didn’t warn us. Are you trying to trick us? ”</p><p>Ying Cang stared at Lu Ming and the other two coldly, directly pinning a huge hat on them.</p><p>“Trap you? You’re thinking too much. Ling Long, brother Wu, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with Ying Cang and the rest. He flew forward, wanting to leave.</p><p>“You want to leave? Hand over what you’ve obtained before you leave!”</p><p>Ying Cang shouted coldly. He stretched out his large hand and grabbed at Lu Ming. His palm emitted a dazzling golden radiance as if it was cast from gold.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>It was not Lu Ming but Yue Linglong. A soft whip appeared in her hand. Like a venomous snake, the soft whip rolled toward Ying Cang.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and a loud boom was heard. Yue Linglong was forced to take three steps back, but Ying Cang was forced to take five steps back, more than Yue Linglong.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others were shocked and looked at Yue Linglong in shock.</p><p>Yue Linglong actually had such a strong combat strength. Not only could she block Ying Cang’s attack, but Ying Cang also retreated more than her.</p><p>Where did this heaven’s favorite come from?</p><p>On the side, Fengyuan Dao, madman, li cunshan, and a few others all had grave expressions.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Ying Cang also looked at Yue Linglong in shock.</p><p>After the exchange of blows just now, he was well aware of how amazing Yue Linglong’s strength was. Even if he were to use his full strength, he might not be Yue Linglong’s opponent.</p><p>“I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to leave alone!”</p><p>Ying Cang’s gaze turned to Fengyuan Dao’s group, wanting to drag them into the water.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>At that moment, Wu Zifeng spoke and stepped forward, a shocking aura erupting from his body.</p><p>Wu Zifeng’s aura was so strong that it was even slightly above Yue Linglong’s, which made the others even more shocked.</p><p>“It’s really lively today!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded in the sky. Following which, a young man appeared in the air and stood above everyone.</p><p>This was a young man from the winged man race. He had a pair of purple wings and was tall and straight. His aura was powerful and carried a sense of pride.</p><p>“It’s wing demons, wing demons!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm. Even Fengyuan Dao, madman, Ying Cang, and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>There was no other reason. The winged demon’s reputation was too great in the outer sect of the Kong Xuan sect, and it was above everyone else.</p><p>The first on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, wing demon!</p><p>“This guy is also here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Of course, he had heard of the first place on the virtual G.o.d leaderboard.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, in the distance, there were more and more people flying over. In just a short while, there were already hundreds of people gathered.</p><p>“It’s w.a.n.g Gao!”</p><p>“There’s also an open gift!”</p><p>Some people kept exclaiming because there were too many experts here. Some of them were also in the top ten of the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>To everyone’s shock, nine out of the top ten virtual G.o.d ranking list had come. Other than Kuang Dao, almost everyone else was here.</p><p>When these people found out that Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng had just come out of the mountain, all of them cast their gazes on the three.</p><p>They even moved their bodies slightly and surrounded Lu Ming and the other two in the middle, preventing them from escaping.</p><p>“Yes, we can’t let them escape. We can’t let them escape …”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp sound was heard. The sound came from the mountain that had just exploded.</p><p>Everyone could not help but look in that direction. There were still rays of light shining from the shattered Mountain. Then, a human figure appeared. It was the remnant soul of the empty star.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>Many people didn’t recognize the star of s.p.a.ce and were a little surprised.</p><p>“You … You’re a star of s.p.a.ce?”</p><p>On the other hand, the wing demon roared in shock when it saw the sky Star. It couldn’t hide the shock on its face.</p><p>The winged demon had seen the s.p.a.ce Star before. One hundred thousand years ago, when the s.p.a.ce Star was still here, it was the No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d rank. If the s.p.a.ce Star hadn’t disappeared, the winged demon might not have been able to get the No. 1 position.</p><p>“What? The star of the sky? The No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list a hundred thousand years ago?”</p><p>After hearing the wing demon’s roar, many people remembered it.</p><p>it can’t be. It’s really him. Didn’t they say that he was dead? ”</p><p>“He actually didn’t die!”</p><p>Many people exclaimed in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
