It could be used with more than just a scorpion tail.</p><p>In the previous sect compet.i.tion, long Xian had only used one scorpion tail to end the battle. No one knew that long Xian could actually use a second one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had held back. He did not use the full power of the ice chain.</p><p>“Ice chain, go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and three more ice chains flew out. A few consecutive clashing sounds were heard and they successfully blocked the Scorpion tail.</p><p>“You’ve actually reached the level of mastery in all six of the frozen shackles.”</p><p>This time, long Xian himself was shocked.</p><p>you’re already surprised. Let’s continue.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand again and nine ice chains appeared on his body. They flew out and wrapped around long Xian.</p><p>“Nine …”</p><p>Long Xian’s pupils contracted and he let out a low growl. His body emitted a black light and another scorpion tail flew out from his body.</p><p>Three scorpion tails!</p><p>Long Xian had actually cultivated three scorpion tails.</p><p>The three scorpion tails and the nine ice chains kept clashing.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>A dense collision sound rang out, and in an instant, the two had exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>so powerful! These two are both monsters!</p><p>“Long Xian is a monster, but Lu Ming is even more of a monster!”</p><p>Lu Ming and long Xian had revealed their trump cards, shocking the audience. Even the inner sect elders could not remain calm.</p><p>On the fighting ring, two figures were constantly flashing, constantly colliding, and fighting fiercely.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivations couldn’t even see the two of them clearly.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them exchanged hundreds of moves before they separated and stood on different sides of the fighting ring.</p><p>Who won?</p><p>The crowd was curious and looked at the two of them carefully.</p><p>“Look, long Xian’s aura is even weaker. His body is covered in a layer of frost.”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that long Xian’s body was covered in a layer of frost. Even his hair and eyebrows were covered in a layer of frost.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>At this moment, long Xian spoke up and actually admitted defeat.</p><p>He looked at the nine flying ice chains behind Lu Ming with a deep fear.</p><p>One of the ice chains, in particular, emitted a shocking amount of cold air. After the continuous collisions, he felt that the blood in his body was about to freeze.</p><p>He needed to divert a large amount of divine power to resist the cold air. If the battle continued, he would definitely not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>“What? Long Xian admits defeat!”</p><p>“Lu Ming has won!”</p><p>Long Xian’s admission of defeat caused an uproar in the crowd.</p><p>This result was truly beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Previously, many people looked down on Lu Ming. They thought that Lu Ming, who was a third stage true G.o.d, would be crushed in minutes.</p><p>But now, even long Xian, who was ranked sixth on the real G.o.d ranking list, was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>Was Lu Ming still human?</p><p>“If you manage to cultivate the fourth scorpion tail, I will definitely not be your opponent.”</p><p>Lu Ming replied politely.</p><p>Long Xian’s strength was truly shocking. Lu Ming had already given it his all, but he still did not have much of an advantage. He had to rely on the terrifying cold Qi in the ninth ice chain to suppress long Xian a little.</p><p>If the other party had a fourth scorpion tail, Lu Ming would not be a match for it.</p><p>This battle made Lu Ming understand that he could not underestimate the heroes of the world.</p><p>There were countless divine techniques and secret skills in the universe.</p><p>It was normal for some extremely powerful freaks to be born.</p><p>“A loss is a loss. Besides, it’s not easy to cultivate a fourth scorpion tail. I’m convinced of my loss!”</p><p>Long Xian was an open and honest man. After cupping his fists, he left the fighting ring.</p><p>“Do you guys still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings again, but there was no response.</p><p>What a joke. Long Xian had been defeated. Who else in the true G.o.d-level could fight Lu Ming?</p><p>If he went up, he would definitely be defeated.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to go up and fight?”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain asked.</p><p>Still, no one answered.</p><p>alright, since no one is willing to accept the challenge, Lu Ming is officially the Saint as per our agreement.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain announced.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others all looked extremely gloomy.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection had suffered a double loss. They had each lost a genius.</p><p>Hmph, this is just the beginning. It’s not that easy to secure the position of the Saint.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son snorted.</p><p>“Congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>Seeing that the Dragon Boat Mountain had already made the announcement, some of the inner sect elders cupped their fists and congratulated Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, there were also some inner elders who looked gloomy and didn’t say anything, like Ying Cang’s master.</p><p>“Seniors, you’re too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming could only give a fist salute in response.</p><p>In truth, he really didn’t care much for this Saint child. However, the Dragon Boat Mountain had forced him to do so, and he had been cursed with the dark Dragon blood Curse. He could only obediently listen to their orders.</p><p>alright, this matter ends here. This year’s compet.i.tion is officially over, ” the Dragon Boat Mountain announced and turned to leave. Before he left, he cast a glance at Lu Ming. Lu Ming could clearly see that the Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes were filled with antic.i.p.ation and a terrifying ferocity.</p><p>“This old man, what is he planning?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>After Dragon Boat Mountain left, the inner sect elders also left one after another.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no, Holy Son Lu Ming, congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>Yue Linglong immediately came up to congratulate him with a smile.</p><p>“Brother Lu, congratulations.”</p><p>Wu Zifeng also cupped his fists and congratulated.</p><p>you guys don’t have to congratulate me. I don’t want to be the Saint yet.</p><p>Lu Ming said helplessly.</p><p>When the other disciples heard this, they were filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred. They wished they could stomp on Lu Ming a few times.</p><p>They didn’t want to be the Saint, but they didn’t. It was too infuriating.</p><p>“Haha, it’s too early to be happy.”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. The Tian Hong Saint son walked over with his people.</p><p>“Tianhong, what are you doing?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang also brought people over to confront the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t make a move.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son glanced at Ouyang Qingxiang and then at Lu Ming. to become a saint, you have to establish your own faction and expand the strength of your faction. Only then can you partic.i.p.ate in the compet.i.tion for the position of sect leader.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son then looked around and said, ” “I, Tian Hong, hereby declare that whoever joins Lu Ming’s faction will be my enemy!”</p><p>A threat, a blatant threat!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was threatening everyone. Anyone who joined Lu Ming’s faction would be his enemy.</p><p>One could imagine the consequences of making an enemy of the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>“Tianhong, don’t you think you’re being too despicable by doing this?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang coldly replied.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
