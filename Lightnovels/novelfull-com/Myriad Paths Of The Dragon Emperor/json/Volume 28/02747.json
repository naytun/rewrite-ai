His cultivation was approaching the peak of virtual G.o.d-level, but it was not so easy to break through to true G.o.d-level.</p><p>The outer sect of the Kong Xuan sect had a rule that if an outer sect disciple could reach the true G.o.d Realm within a million years, they could become an inner sect disciple. However, there were still many people who couldn’t reach the true G.o.d Realm within a million years. From this, one could see the difficulty of reaching the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Even with the energy from the ” quant.i.ty ” formula, it was not realistic for Lu Ming to break through to true G.o.d-level immediately.</p><p>“Come, come. I’ll borrow your power to break through to the true G.o.d Realm.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with madness.</p><p>His fighting spirit seemed to be burning. The spear radiance and the ice chains fought against the nine top young heaven’s favorites of the Scarlet Flame tribe.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage and was constantly injured, coughing out blood, he was actually able to withstand the attacks.</p><p>On the other side, the young men from the unique devil Academy were fighting with the people from the immortal sword sect under the leadership of Liu shangkai. Liu shangkai was fighting with the black-clothed young man.</p><p>“Brother Xuan, why are you so ruthless?”</p><p>Liu shangkai sent a message to the young man in Black.</p><p>As the paragons of the three Overlord sects, they knew each other.</p><p>“We’ve taken on different missions, so we naturally have to do our part.”</p><p>The black-robed young man coldly replied.</p><p>“How about this, brother Xuan, I’ll give up on this mission. As long as you show mercy, I can help you kill that brat.”</p><p>Liu shangkai sent a voice transmission to the teenager in black. He then looked at Lu Ming with a murderous gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually broken through at the critical moment. This made Liu shangkai even more fearful of Lu Ming.</p><p>He could not wait to kill Lu Ming immediately because Lu Ming’s growth rate shocked him.</p><p>“You seem to really want to kill that brat …”</p><p>The black-clothed youth said with interest.</p><p>that’s right. Let me tell you, that brat is from the Kong Xuan sect. His combat strength is extremely terrifying. As you can see, he’s only at the empty G.o.d Realm, but he already has such combat strength. If he grows up, I’m afraid that even the geniuses of the three overlords won’t be his match. I’m not trying to scare you.</p><p>Liu shangkai said.</p><p>The eyes of the black-robed young man from the indestructible sword sect also flashed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was at virtual G.o.d-level, so how could he not see it? to be honest, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>He had never seen a virtual G.o.d with such combat strength.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was already the top sect of the top ten sects. The appearance of such a genius was indeed a huge threat to the three Overlord forces.</p><p>“What’s your plan?”</p><p>The black-clothed youth’s eyes flickered as he said.</p><p>“We’ll pretend to fight. While fighting, we’ll shift the battle to that kid. That kid’s attention has always been on the red flame tribe and you guys. He would never have thought that I would take action at this moment.”</p><p>so, as long as I suddenly attack, I can definitely kill this kid.</p><p>Liu shangkai said coldly.</p><p>“Liu shangkai, you’re despicable.”</p><p>The black-clothed youth sneered.</p><p>Liu shangkai’s expression was ugly. However, he hated Lu Ming to the core. Even if he was ridiculed, he would kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>The young man in Black said. He then sent a voice transmission to the people of the indestructible sword sect. At the same time, Liu shangkai also instructed the people of the unique demon Academy. Both parties pretended to fight and slowly approached Lu Ming. Very soon, they were close to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had already reached the peak of the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm and he was about to break through to the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, true G.o.d-level was indeed not that easy. Lu Ming had tried to break through a few times in a row but to no avail.</p><p>“Just. little more, just. little more …”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was still lacking something and it was difficult to break through the bottleneck.</p><p>If other people knew that he was trying to break through to the true G.o.d Realm, and that he was fighting while trying to break through, they would probably laugh their teeth off.</p><p>It should be known that when other people tried to break through to the true G.o.d Realm, they first had to cultivate to the peak of the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm, then prepare some natural treasures. After making all the preparations, they would slowly succeed.</p><p>Moreover, the success rate wasn’t high. No one could fight while trying to break through to the next realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged a few blows with the Scarlet Flame tribe. His body shook violently and he could not help but retreat. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>“Now is the time …”</p><p>At that moment, Liu shangkai’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The direction in which Lu Ming was retreating happened to be in his direction. This was a good opportunity that was hard to come by.</p><p>Liu shangkai no longer hesitated and attacked on the spot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The runes all over his body glowed. A huge black Seal appeared in his hands and he smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful …”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula quickly reminded him.</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>To be honest, he really didn’t expect Liu shangkai to attack him at this time. His attention was completely focused on the Scarlet Flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>At this critical moment of life and death, he thought that Liu shangkai would try to save his life. He did not expect Liu shangkai to suddenly attack him. It was too late for him to Dodge.</p><p>Lu Ming could only use the nine-stage Crimson Gold armor at full force to resist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Liu shangkai’s big black Seal landed heavily on Lu Ming’s body, producing a loud boom.</p><p>The nine-layer Crimson Gold armor on Lu Ming’s body shook violently and then exploded. Lu Ming’s body was like a cannonball, crashing toward a huge meteorite and shattering it.</p><p>Even the people of the red flame tribe were stunned.</p><p>Liu shangkai, wasn’t he on Lu Ming’s side? why did he suddenly attack Lu Ming?</p><p>However, they were only stunned for a moment. Two Scarlet Flame tribe experts rushed toward the meteorite that Lu Ming had smashed, wanting to kill him completely.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, an astonishing energy exploded from the asteroid.</p><p>This aura was extremely terrifying. It formed an extremely powerful pressure that made everyone feel as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of spear light as big as a mountain swept out and swept towards the two red flame tribe experts.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two experts of the red flame tribe didn’t even have time to react before they were blown up by the spear radiance.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>Although the two red flame tribe experts were not as powerful as Liu shangkai, they were not too far apart. Yet, they were killed in an instant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The meteorite rumbled and a figure rushed out. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, divine energy was boiling on Lu Ming’s body, burning like a flame. Waves of powerful pressure were constantly emitted.</p><p>True G.o.d, this was the pressure of a true G.o.d.</p><p>he’s broken through! This kid has broken through again!</p><p>Someone shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“Heavens, what’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Didn’t lu Ming just break through? why did he break through again?</p><p>One breakthrough was still acceptable. It was possible that Lu Ming’s original cultivation was at the peak and it was normal for him to break through. However, how was it possible for him to break through continuously from virtual G.o.d-level to true G.o.d-level?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
