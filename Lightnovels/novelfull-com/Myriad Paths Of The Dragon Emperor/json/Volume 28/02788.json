If anyone can defeat Lu Ming, I will retract my order and cancel the t.i.tle!”</p><p>if no true G.o.d can defeat Lu Ming, then Lu Ming will become the new Holy Son. Do you have any objections? ”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain’s words caused many people’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>All the true G.o.ds from the major sects could challenge Lu Ming. If they won, Lu Ming would not be able to become the Saint.</p><p>“What is Lu Ming’s cultivation level?”</p><p>Someone quickly asked.</p><p>I’ve seen it. It’s third stage true G.o.d!</p><p>Someone said. Those whose cultivation levels were much higher than Lu Ming’s could still tell Lu Ming’s cultivation level at a glance.</p><p>what? only at stage three true G.o.d Realm? with such a low cultivation, any true G.o.d Realm expert should be able to defeat him!</p><p>“That’s right, it’s strange. What does sect master mean by this condition? We definitely can’t win against Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Strange, this is strange!”</p><p>Many people were puzzled.</p><p>Dragon boats mountain seemed to want to confer Lu Ming the t.i.tle of the Holy Son. However, the conditions that they offered clearly showed that they did not want Lu Ming to be the Holy Son.</p><p>No one would think that a stage three true G.o.d could win against those true G.o.d geniuses from the seven great factions.</p><p>What a joke. Stage three real G.o.d was just a low-rank real G.o.d. How could he compete with those middle-rank and high-rank real G.o.ds? especially when the seven major sects had experts on the real G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>Those existences could kill Lu Ming with one finger. There was no comparison at all.</p><p>The eyes of the Tianhong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others also lit up.</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming’s combat strength was very strong, there was a limit to it. He could not possibly be a match for those high-level true G.o.ds.</p><p>From their point of view, Dragon Boat Mountain’s actions were only to give them a way out.</p><p>“Alright, I agree to this suggestion!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son immediately expressed their opinions.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins also agreed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s gaze landed on Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Since things had come to this, it was obvious that the Dragon boats mountain wanted him to take over the position of the Holy Son. He would take it then. Lu Ming was not someone who was afraid of trouble.</p><p>WOWO, this guy really dares to accept the challenge. He’s really not afraid of death!</p><p>even if he doesn’t die, he’ll be abused. There’s a good show to watch.</p><p>Many people sneered and looked like they were watching a good show.</p><p>“Lu Ming, good luck! I hope you can successfully become a saint!”</p><p>Yue Linglong waved her fists and cheered for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you can definitely do it!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng also patted Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ming suppress Ouyang Qingxiang’s two subordinates. They were extremely powerful. If Lu Ming were to take action, he might have a chance of winning.</p><p>“Sect master, can we fight to the death in this battle?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Since you want to fight, then let’s fight to the death!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>Regardless of life and death, that meant that he could kill.</p><p>“This kid is finished!”</p><p>Many people looked at him with pity, thinking that Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>“I’m going to fight this kid!”</p><p>A voice was heard. A young man from the sacred son of floating light’s faction stepped down and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>it’s Huang Wen! Huang Wen is about to make his move!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>That’s right, this person was Huang Wen.</p><p>Huang Wen is at the eighth stage of true G.o.d Realm. To deal with a mere third stage true G.o.d, once he makes a move, he uses an eighth stage true G.o.d. This is also making a mountain out of a molehill!</p><p>he’s indeed making a mountain out of a molehill. However, I heard that Huang Wen has a grudge against Lu Ming. I guess that’s why he took action!</p><p>I see. He’s trying to seize the opportunity to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“Big brother, kill him, kill him for me, hahaha!”</p><p>In the crowd, Huang Wu roared in his heart as if he could already see the scene of Huang Wen killing Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Huang Wen landed on the fighting ring. He exuded a powerful aura that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, how do you want to die? Speak!”</p><p>Huang Wen’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>He was full of confidence in himself.</p><p>He was also a genius. Moreover, his cultivation had reached stage eight true G.o.d. Dealing with a stage three true G.o.d was absolutely a matter of certainty.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not know that two of the floating light Saint son’s sect’s elites had already died at Lu Ming’s hands. He did not know that le Zhong had also died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>They only knew that Lu Ming had gone out for a while and returned safely. They did not know that those people had been killed by Lu Ming. They only thought that those people had not found Lu Ming.</p><p>If he had known that Lu Ming had already killed those people, Huang Wen would not have been so confident.</p><p>you talk too much. Make your move. I’ll give you your last chance.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Big words, storm fist!”</p><p>Huang Wen shouted coldly and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>With a punch, a rumbling explosion came from the sky. It was like a huge wave that surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He condensed a long spear with divine power in his palm. Five divine flames burned fiercely. Endless divine power gathered in the long spear and he swept it out.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A giant spear light shot into the sky and collided with Huang Wen’s ten thousand wave fist force, creating a deafening explosion.</p><p>Following that, Huang Wen’s fist force trembled continuously and was crushed by the spear radiance. Huang Wen’s expression changed drastically as he retreated to the edge of the fighting ring before he stopped.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded, as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>This situation was completely different from what they had expected.</p><p>They had expected Huang Wen to crush Lu Ming. However, they did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to push Huang Wen back with a single strike.</p><p>How could the fighting power of a third stage true G.o.d be strong to this extent?</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Huang Wen roared in his heart. His expression was extremely gloomy. Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength? If you have any G.o.dly skills that you haven’t used yet, use them quickly. This is your last chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his face full of disdain.</p><p>you’re looking for death. I’ll let you see my true strength, vast wave saber technique!</p><p>die! Huang Wen roared. He took out a saber and charged at Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>With a slash, ten thousand layers of blade waves appeared in the void. They stacked on top of each other and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was Huang Wen’s trump card unique skill. Its power was extremely strong. When he executed it with his strength, ordinary stage nine true G.o.d would be killed by him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
