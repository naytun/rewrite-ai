It seems that you’ve made a great progress!”</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing said as he glanced at the winged howler. Then, he turned to Lu Ming and the other two, his expression ferocious.”You can’t let them go! They’ve obtained a Supreme treasure!”</p><p>“What? A Supreme treasure?”</p><p>Many people were shocked. They looked at Lu Ming and the other two with burning eyes.</p><p>do you know why I disappeared for 100000 years? it was because I wanted to get the treasure here. Unfortunately, I was trapped by the formation by accident and failed at the last step. I didn’t expect that he would get it!</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing sighed and pointed at Lu Ming. As he said this, his body started to twist.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming the most. It was Lu Ming who had seen through his scheme and used the death eye of the formation to harm him to this state. It was all Lu Ming’s fault.</p><p>He wanted Lu Ming to end up in an extremely miserable state.</p><p>His remnant soul could not hold on for long and was about to dissipate. At the thought of him dissipating, his hatred for Lu Ming and the rest intensified.</p><p>“That’s a Supreme treasure. Once you obtain it, you’ll definitely soar into the sky. It’s just a matter of time before you dominate the Qin heaven Galaxy. It’ll depend on which one of you is fated to obtain it, hahaha!”</p><p>With that, the empty star’s body exploded with a bang and turned into dust, completely disappearing.</p><p>However, his words ignited the fire in everyone’s heart. It was the fire of desire.</p><p>No one would doubt the words of the empty star.</p><p>The empty star had stayed here for 100000 years for that treasure. If the treasure wasn’t precious, why would he have stayed here for 100000 years?</p><p>What could be the treasure that made the empty star so crazy?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, everyone burst out with a shocking aura. With the winged demon, Fengyuan Dao, and the others in the lead, they pressed toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Especially Lu Ming.</p><p>It was because the empty star had made it very clear that the treasure was in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the treasure!”</p><p>Ying Cang could not help but make the first move. His entire body was covered in golden light as he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ying Cang, I’m your opponent!”</p><p>Yue Linglong waved her soft whip, which turned into thousands of whip shadows and swept toward Ying Cang.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of blows in an instant. The result was that Ying Cang retreated thousands of meters, his hands trembling slightly.</p><p>He was not Yue Linglong’s match.</p><p>“Hand over the treasure. No one can protect you today!”</p><p>The winged howler said coldly. It looked down from above and stomped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the last step, a shocking power burst out from his feet. His divine power was like a stormy sea that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>They were both at the first stage of true G.o.d Realm, but the wing demon’s strength was indeed incomparably shocking. Just this move alone was a whole lot stronger than mad Dao’s.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. I’d like to experience it!</p><p>Wu Zifeng’s eyes burst with a brilliant light. His body rushed up and his fingers pointed out like a sword.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>The sword Qi collided with the wing demon’s attack, causing a shocking boom. The two of them retreated slightly.</p><p>“What? He’s that strong?”</p><p>Everyone looked at Wu Zifeng in shock.</p><p>Wu Zifeng was actually able to fight the winged demon. Where did this heaven’s favorite come from?</p><p>“You’re not from the Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>The winged demon looked at Wu Zifeng with a grave expression.</p><p>“Naturally not!”</p><p>Said Wu Zifeng. His fighting spirit grew stronger, and his divine power was like an avalanche.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” sacred-grade divine power! This person is the same as the winged demon. The divine power he controls is sacred-grade divine power!</p><p>this person isn’t from the Kong Xuan sect, but he’s able to enter the dark Dragon secret realm. What force is he from? ”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>today, you want to protect the treasure with just the two of you? you’re too naive!</p><p>The winged demon said coldly, then glanced at the Fengyuan sect.</p><p>Fengyuan Dao, madman, li cunshan, and the others could not hold it in any longer. They all rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the treasure and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>Li cunshan roared and attacked first. The divine weapon he used was a Warhammer. As he struck, the void exploded continuously with astonishing power.</p><p>The giant hammer crushed toward Lu Ming as if he would be crushed into a pulp of flesh in the next moment.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He took a step forward and threw a punch without even holding a weapon.</p><p>He wanted to use his fist to block li cunshan’s giant hammer.</p><p>“This kid is looking for death!”</p><p>Some people shook their heads.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming made his move, they could tell that his cultivation was only at the seventh tier of the void G.o.d Realm. It was already good enough for a seventh tier void G.o.d to enter the dark Dragon secret realm. He actually dared to take li cunshan’s giant hammer head on. If he was not courting death, what was?</p><p>However, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were calm. They knew how terrifying Lu Ming’s combat strength was.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist accurately collided with li cunshan’s giant hammer. It was as if two stars had collided, and a shocking boom erupted.</p><p>However, the result left everyone dumbfounded.</p><p>After the collision, li cunshan was the one who retreated. Lu Ming’s body only swayed slightly.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>At this moment, the pupils of the wing demon, Fengyuan Dao, Ying Cang, and the others contracted as they revealed disbelieving expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually managed to catch li cunshan’s attack with his bare hands. Even the winged demon could not do that.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at seventh level void G.o.d-level, but he had such strong combat strength?</p><p>Li cunshan himself was also stunned.</p><p>“I don’t believe it, G.o.dly storm hammer!”</p><p>Li cunshan roared and swung his giant hammer, attacking Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>A divine artifact appeared in Lu Ming’s palm. It was a level one middle-grade divine artifact.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out. The long spear carried a terrifying power as it blasted towards li cunshan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided for the second time, but this time, li cunshan let out a m.u.f.fled groan. His body was pushed back, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Everyone was stunned, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually suppressing li cunshan. They collided head-on and Li cunshan vomited blood.</p><p>Li cunshan was ranked seventh on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. His combat strength far surpa.s.sed other powerhouses of the same level. Moreover, his cultivation had already broken through to the first-tier true G.o.d Realm. With such combat strength, he was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>What kind of monster was this?</p><p>At this moment, the wing demon, Fengyuan Dao and the others looked extremely solemn.</p><p>I’m telling you, I did get a treasure, but it’s not that precious. But I know that you won’t believe me no matter what I say now. Since you want the treasure, I’ll fight with you today!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and looked around.”Miss Linglong, brother Wu, you can leave now. If they want to fight, I alone am enough!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
