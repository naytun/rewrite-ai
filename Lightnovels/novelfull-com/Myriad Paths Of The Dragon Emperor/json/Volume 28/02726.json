It was extremely thick and filled with shocking power.</p><p>Although the flowing water sect’s Captain had tried his best, the difference in cultivation was clear. He was completely outmatched and was forced to retreat. His body trembled and he kept coughing up blood.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>An hai was extremely domineering. He pressed his iron rod down again, trying to force the flowing water sect’s team leader to his knees.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice came from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>It was the team leader of the unique devil Academy. He was a young man with black demonic patterns on his face. As he spoke, the young man sitting next to him rushed out at an unbelievable speed. In the next moment, he appeared in front of the flowing water sect’s team leader. A huge cauldron appeared in his hand. He waved it and smashed it toward an Hai’s iron rod.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded, and the two figures were forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>An hai and the young man from the unique devil Academy were equally matched in this exchange.</p><p>stage four true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>An hai licked his lips. His eyes became even more ferocious, and he revealed a strong desire to fight.</p><p>An hai had always been a warlike person.</p><p>However, an hai did not continue to attack. He knew that since the unique demon Academy had made a move, it would be difficult to make the captain of the flowing water sect kneel.</p><p>“Your Kong Xuan sect is so imposing. You made the geniuses of other sects kneel in front of everyone. Are you trying to replace my unique devil Academy and become the Overlord?”</p><p>The team leader of the Yimo Academy said coldly. The moment he spoke, he had already accused the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The team leader of the unique devil Academy then looked at Lu Ming with a sharp gaze and said,”Also, as the captain, can you only hide behind others and give orders? I don’t care who you are. It’s one thing for you to act like a tyrant in the Kong Xuan sect, but it’s ridiculous for you to act like a tyrant in front of the Yimo Academy.”</p><p>“That’s what you said, I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“However, you have done it. Even if you want to beat a dog, you have to look at its master. You have to pay the price for injuring a member of the flowing water sect in front of me. Now, you better come out and apologize to me, to the flowing water sect, and to my Yimo Academy.”</p><p>The team leader of the unique devil Academy stared at Lu Ming with a bone-chilling gaze, as if he wanted to pierce through Lu Ming.</p><p>“Apologize? You’re thinking too much, the flowing water sect’s defeat was purely their own doing.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently as he continued to drink his wine. He looked calm, which made the team leader of the unique devil Academy’s eyes glint even colder.</p><p>“Good, good, good!”</p><p>The team leader of the unique devil Academy said ‘good’ three times and said coldly, ” then, what happens next is what you asked for. Attack, I want that kid to kneel.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As the captain of the unique demon Academy finished speaking, seven or eight people from the unique demon Academy immediately stood up. Powerful auras erupted from their bodies. With a flash, they appeared in different directions.</p><p>A few people stopped the long-faced young man from the Kong Xuan sect. The expressions of the long-faced young man and the others changed, but they did not attack in the end and just watched quietly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>An hai, on the other hand, roared and swept his iron rod horizontally, trying to send the person in front of him flying.</p><p>“Behave yourself!”</p><p>In front of an hai, the man with the cauldron waved it around. The cauldron was like a mountain, crashing toward an hai. The two of them exchanged a few blows, but they were both equally matched. An hai was being held back.</p><p>With that, all the people from Kong Xuan sect were held back, and only Lu Ming was still drinking in his seat.</p><p>leave this brat to me. Back in the thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment, this brat killed many of our Tigermen race’s geniuses. Today, I’m going to make him kneel before me and repent.</p><p>Hu ya suddenly stood up from his seat in the unique demon Academy and stared at Lu Ming with a ferocious look.</p><p>Oh, he’s from the same batch as you? ”</p><p>The team leader of the unique devil Academy was also stunned.</p><p>that’s right. However, I suppressed my cultivation during the thirteen clans ‘test, so I couldn’t use my full strength. Now is just right.</p><p>Hu ya said savagely.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll leave this kid to you.”</p><p>The team leader of the unique devil Academy said.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Hu ya’s body and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>First level true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>This was Hu ya’s realm.</p><p>Back then, during the Qin heavenly thirteen clan’s a.s.sessment, Hu ya’s cultivation was already at the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm. It wasn’t surprising that he had broken through to the true G.o.d Realm in these few years.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get up and fight me. I want you to know what true combat strength is.”</p><p>Hu ya strode towards Lu Ming, his mouth wide with fangs and his face fierce. His body was like a mountain, and an ordinary person would probably be terrified by his aura.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even spare Hu ya a glance. He said indifferently, I’ve already lost. I’m not interested in fighting. Let’s find someone who can fight.</p><p>Although Hu ya controlled divine-grade divine power and had powerful combat strength, Lu Ming’s cultivation was already at eighth-tier void G.o.d Realm. He had improved greatly in all aspects and cultivated the universe thousand Dao mantra. He did not think much of Hu ya.</p><p>However, to Hu ya’s ears, these words were a great insult.</p><p>how arrogant! If it wasn’t for the fact that my cultivation base was suppressed, I could have crushed you to death with a single finger!</p><p>die! Hu ya bellowed. He took a step forward and appeared on Lu Ming’s body. His huge palm grabbed at Lu Ming’s head. He wanted to crush Lu Ming’s head like a watermelon.</p><p>As the huge hand pressed down, the energy was overwhelming. Lu Ming’s seat and the food and wine on it shook violently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. A wave of divine power spread out and enveloped the food and drinks on the table, making them motionless.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming raised his hand and his fingers were like a spear, piercing forward.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers shot out a ray of spear light, which struck Hu ya’s palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine powers collided, and a huge boom erupted. Then, a painful roar was heard. A figure retreated, and the ground rumbled.</p><p>The one who retreated was naturally Hu ya.</p><p>Moreover, a b.l.o.o.d.y hole had appeared on his palm, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>At the scene, other than the people from Kong Xuan sect, everyone else’s eyes narrowed as they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming sat still. He could actually pierce through Hu ya’s palm with one move. How could he be so strong?</p><p>It should be known that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the eighth level of the virtual G.o.d Realm, while Hu ya was already at the first level of the true G.o.d Realm. Most importantly, Hu ya was not an ordinary person. He was a peerless genius who could control divine grade divine power. Even in the unique demon Academy, there were not many people like him. In the future, when he grew up, he would become the Holy Son of the unique demon Academy and be qualified to compete for the position of the future Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>His own combat strength could not be measured by his cultivation. He could easily defeat opponents of a higher level. However, he was injured by Lu Ming, who was a realm higher than him.</p><p>Even Hu ya himself was extremely shocked. He knew that his sacred grade divine power had been easily pierced through in the collision just now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
