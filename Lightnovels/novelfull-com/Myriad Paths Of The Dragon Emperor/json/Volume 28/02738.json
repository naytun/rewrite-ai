Its length could be long or short. Lu Ming suddenly cast it. Like a long snake, it turned into a few thousand meters long and enveloped Liu shangkai. Then, it suddenly tightened, trying to lock Liu shangkai in place.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s expression changed drastically as he felt a bone-piercing chill envelop him, trying to freeze him into a popsicle.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared, and divine power burst forth. The patterns on his body glowed, and black rays of light sharper than divine blades shot out, slashing at the chains.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, but the chain remained unscathed.</p><p>If it had not been for the refinement of the ball of frosty liquid, the ice chains would have been unable to withstand Liu shangkai’s attack. But now, Liu shangkai was unable to cut through the ice chains.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The ice chains trembled and shrunk rapidly, wrapping around Liu shangkai.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared madly and continued to unleash his power. He even condensed a huge seal to attack, but it was still useless.</p><p>The terrifying cold air continuously invaded Liu shangkai’s body. He felt as if the blood in his body had been frozen.</p><p>In the next moment, the chain wrapped itself tightly around Liu shangkai’s body, freezing him into a popsicle.</p><p>Although Liu shangkai had been using his divine power to resist, he wouldn’t be able to hold on for long if this continued.</p><p>“Liu shangkai was actually defeated.”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. They had never expected such a scene to happen. In particular, the faces of the disciples of the unique demon Academy turned pale.</p><p>They were very clear about how powerful Liu shangkai was. However, even Liu shangkai was no match for Lu Ming. If they were to go up against him, they would be even more vulnerable.</p><p>“What a terrifying chill.”</p><p>Bing Qing and the other paragons of the ice Soul Clan looked at Lu Ming and the ice chains in shock.</p><p>This was because the coldness from the ice chains made even them feel apprehensive.</p><p>They were experts in playing with ice, and it was rare for them to feel a chill that could make their hearts palpitate.</p><p>“Now, you’re the one kneeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Liu shangkai step by step. With a single thought, he waved the ice chain and smashed it heavily on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled, and a huge crater was created. Liu shangkai was trapped in the crater, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His body was still bound by the ice chains.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t move at all. His entire body was frozen stiff.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming controlled the ice chain, lifted Liu shangkai up and smashed him down again. This time, Lu Ming controlled it very well. He made Liu shangkai kneel on the ground.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Liu shangkai howled madly like a wild beast. His eyes were bloodshot as if he wanted to eat Lu Ming.</p><p>A great humiliation, this was a great humiliation.</p><p>He actually knelt in front of Lu Ming in public.</p><p>One should know that he was a genius who could control the divine grade divine power and was one of the top geniuses in the unique demon Academy. Once he stepped into the heavenly G.o.d stage, he would become the Holy Son of the unique demon Academy and have the chance to compete for the position of the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>However, he actually knelt in front of Lu Ming in front of everyone. This was not only about his face, but also the face of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>If this matter were to spread to the unique demon Academy, he would definitely lose the qualification to become a Holy Son.</p><p>How could a person who knelt down in front of a disciple of the Kong Xuan sect be qualified to become a saint? Wouldn’t the reputation of the unique devil Academy be greatly tarnished?</p><p>Therefore, this kneel was equivalent to destroying Liu shangkai’s future.</p><p>That was why he was filled with hatred.</p><p>He could not wait to skin Lu Ming alive.</p><p>if you want others to kneel down, you should be prepared to kneel down. For the sake of the ninth young lord, I’ll spare your life today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and kept the ice chain.</p><p>Now, after Lu Ming’s ice shackles had refined the ball of liquid, its power had increased greatly. Lu Ming no longer feared Liu shangkai.</p><p>For now, it was more important to reach the peak. Lu Ming estimated that there might be a Cold Moon Stone on the peak.</p><p>When he got the Cold Moon Stone, Lu Ming would definitely kill Liu shangkai to get rid of any future trouble if he had the chance.</p><p>After Lu Ming put away the ice chain, Liu shangkai’s body was still frozen. He continued to circulate his divine power and his body only recovered after a moment.</p><p>His heart was filled with endless killing intent. However, he held it back and suppressed it in his heart. Then, he returned to the crowd from the unique devil Academy with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Everyone continued to wait.</p><p>A few more days pa.s.sed, and more people arrived one after another. This time, almost all the heaven’s pride experts of the major sects had arrived. Of course, the number of people was a little less. They were probably dead.</p><p>alright, now that almost everyone is here, let’s set off. The icy jade chilling heart is at the peak of that mountain!</p><p>Bing Qing said as she looked at the icy peak that was as high as the sky.</p><p>there are many wild beasts on that Ice Peak. The most shocking thing is that there are a few terrifying ice dragons at the bottom of the ice Peak. Each of these ice dragons has reached the heavenly G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“What? A heavenly G.o.d Ice Dragon?”</p><p>are you kidding me? a celestial deity realm Ice Dragon is guarding. How can we possibly charge through? are we courting death? ”</p><p>that’s right. A heavenly G.o.d Ice Dragon can freeze us into popsicles with one breath. Ninth young lord, are you mistaken? ”</p><p>Many people started to shout when they heard Bing Qing’s words.</p><p>that’s right. We can’t deal with a sky G.o.d Ice Dragon. Of course, we don’t need to. The ice Soul Clan has a plan.</p><p>Bing Qing smiled.</p><p>Only then did everyone calm down.</p><p>although the Ice Dragon is strong, the ice Soul Clan has prepared a type of cold heart gra.s.s. We have injected a type of poison into this cold heart gra.s.s.</p><p>“The Ice Dragon loves to eat the cold heart gra.s.s the most. Once it finds it, it will swallow it immediately. In that case, it will be poisoned. This kind of poison is enough to make a heavenly G.o.d Ice Dragon unconscious for half a month. Half a month’s time is enough for us to rush to the top of the mountain and get the ice jade cold heart.”</p><p>Bing Qing explained.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Immediately, everyone withdrew their auras and carefully approached the ice Mountain.</p><p>When they were a few hundred miles away from the ice Mountain, they found a few ice dragons lying at the foot of the mountain. Each Ice Dragon was ten thousand meters long. They lay at the foot of the mountain like a few mountain ranges.</p><p>“You guys wait for me here!”</p><p>Bing Qing warned, and in a flash, she moved forward.</p><p>After traveling for a while, Bing Qing took out a Jade box from her storage ring. The surface of the jade box was covered with strange runes.</p><p>Bing Qing removed the runes carefully and opened the jade box. She took out a few stalks of cold heart gra.s.s and placed them on the ground. Bing Qing ran and returned to Lu Ming and the rest’s side.</p><p>After the cold heart gra.s.s appeared, it immediately emitted a strong fragrance that spread thousands of miles away.</p><p>The ice dragons immediately smelled the fragrance of the cold heart gra.s.s. Their noses twitched a few times, and they opened their eyes in unison.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
