Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng headed to the mission Hall, ready to exchange the dark Dragon beast core and Dragon Bone flower for points.</p><p>Of course, Wu Zifeng was not a member of the Kong Xuan sect, so he naturally could not exchange for points. He gave the beast core and Dragon Bone flower to Yue Linglong and let her exchange for points.</p><p>Lu Ming did not head straight to the missions Hall, mainly because he had to sort out the storage rings he had obtained from the winged demon and the rest.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not return to the outer sect. Now that he had caused such a big commotion, if he returned to the outer sect, it would definitely alert the outer sect. By then, it would be troublesome.</p><p>Lu Ming found a random spot in the inner sect area, took out his storage ring, and started tapping lightly.</p><p>There were mountains of divine crystals, blacksmithing materials, and low-grade divine artifacts of various levels.</p><p>“QiuQiu, here you go!”</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was rich and generous. He immediately took out a few level nine low-grade divine artifacts for QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>Previously, QiuQiu had been in the form of a bracelet and was wearing it on Lu Ming’s wrist. At this moment, it had turned into a round ball. It picked up a few divine artifacts and gobbled them up.</p><p>All these years, Lu Ming had not stopped feeding QiuQiu. QiuQiu’s abilities had been improving. Now, it had already reached eighth-level virtual G.o.d-level and was very powerful. It was strong enough to fight against the top-ranked existences on the virtual G.o.d ranking.</p><p>QiuQiu was eating at the side while Lu Ming began to count the dark Dragon beast core and Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>The nine storage rings, in addition to Kuang Dao’s, could be said that the storage rings of the top ten geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking list were all in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>These people were all powerful and had great gains.</p><p>The dark Dragon beast cores and Dragonbone flowers from the ten of them added up to more than three thousand points. If they were to be exchanged for points, that would be three hundred thousand points.</p><p>On top of that, Lu Ming’s own netherdragon beast core and Dragonbone flower could be exchanged for about sixty thousand points.</p><p>A huge harvest, this was a truly huge harvest.</p><p>No wonder they were ranked in the top ten of the virtual G.o.d ranking list. The ten of them together had such a great harvest.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were able to hunt a large number of netherdragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers because the netherdragon Blood Curse in Lu Ming’s body would attract the netherdragon beasts and the Dragonbone flower.</p><p>As for the others, they had to rely on themselves to find it, so it was much more difficult. It was already very good that the winged devil and the others had contributed so much.</p><p>Saint-grade Divine Art and secret skill, here I come!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart. He then put QiuQiu away and headed to the hall of missions.</p><p>When the people from the hall of missions saw Lu Ming taking out so many Dark Dragon beast cores and dragon bones, they were so shocked that they almost fell over. In a state of extreme shock, they exchanged points for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three hundred and sixty thousand points!”</p><p>Lu Ming had exchanged a total of three hundred and sixty thousand points. He left the missions Hall in satisfaction and headed to the Sutra library.</p><p>The old men who were guarding the Scripture chamber were still the same old men.</p><p>“Senior, I would like to exchange for a divine grade technique. Is that alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said to an elder.</p><p>“You want to exchange for a divine grade technique?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>exchange? you can exchange for it, but you can only exchange for the first few levels at most. It’s not very useful, and the price is very high. Do you really want to exchange? ”</p><p>The old man asked again.</p><p>It was rare for people to come to the sacred storage Pavilion to exchange for divine grade techniques. This was because divine grade techniques could only be exchanged for the first few levels. They were not very useful, but the price was shockingly high. Almost no one would come to exchange.</p><p>senior, I want to exchange for the first level, mainly because I want to study it. Please allow me to do so!</p><p>Lu Ming said sincerely.</p><p>according to the rules, you can exchange for it. Since you insist on exchanging, I won’t stop you. Here are the introductions of several divine grade divine skills and techniques. Take a look for yourself!</p><p>The old man gave Lu Ming a jade talisman.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and read it carefully.</p><p>Inside were simple introductions of several Saint grade divine arts and techniques, all of which were astonishingly powerful and had their own merits.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll choose the first stage of the ultimate cold divine technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming said after returning the Jade talisman to the old man.</p><p>He had his eyes on a divine technique called the ‘divine technique of extreme cold’.</p><p>If the ultimate frost divine technique was cultivated to its peak, one could cultivate divine power. The ultimate frost divine power was extremely powerful and could freeze everything.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming chose the ultimate frost divine technique was that he had previously cultivated a King-grade divine technique, the divine frost technique.</p><p>With the frost divine technique as a Foundation, the speed of cultivating the ultimate frost divine technique would definitely be faster.</p><p>okay, give me your ident.i.ty token. It costs 50000 points to exchange for the first level of the extreme cold divine technique. The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming pa.s.sed the ident.i.ty token to the elder. The elder swiped it on an array disc and Lu Ming lost 50000 points.</p><p>The price was astonishingly high. If not for Lu Ming, the others would not have exchanged for it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not feel the slightest bit of reluctance. One must know that obtaining the first level was equivalent to obtaining the entire ultimate cold divine technique.</p><p>“This is the first stage of the extreme cold divine technique, take it!”</p><p>Then, the old man took out a scroll from his storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming received it happily and kept it in his storage ring.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming walked into the Scriptures Depository and looked around.</p><p>The first thing he wanted to do was to exchange for a divine skill and a secret skill.</p><p>Now that he had the ” quant.i.ty ” formula, he could store Shen power in it. In the future, he could use his Shen skills to his heart’s content, so he naturally had to cultivate another Shen skill.</p><p>He wanted to find a speed-type divine skill to cultivate.</p><p>At his cultivation level, the incomplete ROC wings technique that he had cultivated previously was no longer of much use. Other people had cultivated complete speed-type divine skills, and his speed could no longer keep up with others.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and soon, he arrived at the fourth level.</p><p>There were all seven or eight levels of divine skills here.</p><p>“Nine heavenly kun Peng technique!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a speed-type divine skill called the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. His eyes lit up immediately.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique was a seven-layered speed-type divine skill. It imitated the nine heavenly kun Peng, and once executed, one’s speed would be as fast as the kun Peng.</p><p>The kun Peng was not an ordinary ROC. Even in the primeval universe, the kun Peng was an extremely terrifying existence. It was said that a newborn kun Peng could travel freely in the universe and travel between different galaxies and star areas at an unimaginable speed.</p><p>This nine heavenly kun Peng technique wasn’t the complete version. It seemed to be an incomplete scroll, with only the first seven stages. There seemed to be more after that, but they had already been lost.</p><p>The exchange price was thirty thousand points.</p><p>“I’ll take this!”</p><p>Lu Ming decided to exchange for the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>Now that he had a speed-type divine skill, the next step would be the secret skill. Lu Ming arrived at the fifth level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
