Also, the center of the map is our destination.</p><p>Bing Qing explained and pointed to the center of the map.</p><p>There was a sign there. It was the sign of an Ice Mountain at the center of the map.</p><p>“Remember this map first. If we get separated later on, we’ll meet up at the center. Also, we’ll meet here within half a year and leave together.”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>Everyone immediately focused their attention on the map and memorized it.</p><p>Almost everyone who had reached the true G.o.d Realm had a photographic memory. Soon, everyone memorized the map.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bing Qing kept the map and everyone flew towards the North.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The cold wind was bone-piercing and the temperature was shockingly low.</p><p>However, there were still living beings in this world despite the low temperature.</p><p>All sorts of plants grew on the mountains and in the valleys. Some were as white as Jade, some were as red as fire, and some were as green as Jade.</p><p>In the valley, one could occasionally see the figures of some creatures flashing past.</p><p>Everyone secretly praised her. Nature was indeed full of wonders.</p><p>Very quickly, they had flown over ten million miles away. However, there was still a long way to go before they reached the center.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a sharp, ear-piercing sound was heard. Then, a beam of white light shot into the sky from an Ice Mountain, bringing with it a whistling cold wind as it pounced toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“That is … A Phoenix!”</p><p>When everyone saw the white light, they were shocked.</p><p>The body of the white light was a snow-white bird, which looked exactly like the divine beast Phoenix.</p><p>“It’s the frost Jade Ice Phoenix! Be careful!”</p><p>Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s speed was astonishingly fast. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived. With a flap of its wings, ice crystals that looked like ice swords flew towards Lu Ming and the rest. The power was terrifying.</p><p>Everyone took action, circulating their divine power to resist.</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He swept the spear at one of the ice crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ice crystals were shattered by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He found that the power of the ice crystal was shockingly strong.</p><p>As expected, some of the weaker cultivators were forced back by the ice crystals and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The cold Jade Ice Phoenix screeched and flapped its wings continuously. Countless ice crystals, bringing with them a cold wind, swept towards them.</p><p>“b.a.s.t.a.r.d, I’ll kill you.”</p><p>A voice sounded. It was the captain of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>This person was called Liu shangkai. Pitch-black divine power burst out of his body as he threw a few punches in succession.</p><p>Liu shangkai, as the captain of the unique devil Academy, controlled a divine grade power, and his combat strength was definitely terrifying.</p><p>He punched out a few times, and a few fist forces crushed out, shattering a large number of ice crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Liu shangkai turned into a black light and rushed toward the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>“Holy demon divine seal!”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s cold voice was heard. The black marks on his face glowed with a bright black light, then formed a huge black Seal and pressed down on the ice Phoenix.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix let out an angry cry and opened its mouth to shoot out a white beam of light, clashing with the seal that Liu shangkai had thrown out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exploded with a shocking boom. The pillar of light shot out by the frost Jade Ice Phoenix was shattered. However, the power of Liu shangkai’s seal was also greatly reduced. It continued to suppress the ice Phoenix. The frost Jade Ice Phoenix spread its wings, which were like ice blades, and flapped.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Liu shangkai’s seal exploded, and he was sent flying backward. The seals on his face were bleeding as if they had cracked.</p><p>Liu shangkai was actually no match for the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Liu shangkai’s strength was absolutely amazing, but he still couldn’t defeat the frost Jade Ice Phoenix. If the others went up, they would only die.</p><p>After forcing Liu shangkai back, the frost Jade Ice Phoenix flapped her wings and turned into a white light as she pounced towards the crowd.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, Bing Qing made her move. Her entire body seemed to have turned into a sword light, emitting an icy cold aura.</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix’s wings slashed out like blades, clashing with Bing Qing’s sword light.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix and Bing Qing retreated at the same time.</p><p>However, the two of them continued to fight fiercely. They exchanged more than ten moves in a row, but it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“I blocked it.”</p><p>The others were overjoyed, but at the same time, Bing Qing’s strength shocked them.</p><p>Bing Qing’s combat strength was even above Liu shangkai’s.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>The frost Jade Ice Phoenix couldn’t take the battle down and let out an angry cry. Her attacks became more and more violent, but Bing Qing’s combat strength was extremely strong. She completely blocked the frost Jade Ice Phoenix and even gained the upper hand.</p><p>However, at this moment, everyone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>That was because a sharp cry was heard in the surrounding area.</p><p>Then, from some of the ice mountains, figures rushed out.</p><p>Frost Jade ice phoenixes, all of them were frost Jade ice phoenixes. At a glance, there were a total of eight of them. With the one from before, there were nine of them.</p><p>The eight behind had huge bodies and wingspans of over 200 meters. Their auras were extremely terrifying and were definitely not any weaker than the one before.</p><p>Everyone’s expression became extremely ugly.</p><p>With so many frost Jade ice phoenixes appearing all at once, how could they fight?</p><p>The cries of the eight frost Jade ice phoenixes resounded through the firmament. They flapped their wings and dense ice crystals shot towards Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>attack! someone shouted. Everyone used their full strength to block the ice crystals.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his long spear. In an instant, dozens of ice crystals were pierced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure also drifted backward. The power of these ice crystals was very shocking.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>There were a few consecutive screams, but not everyone could block them. A few young men had their bodies pierced by ice crystals and were frozen. Then, with a bang, they exploded into pieces.</p><p>On the side of Kong Xuan sect, they did not suffer any losses. Lu Ming had blocked dozens of ice crystals alone earlier, sharing a large amount of the pressure.</p><p>But at this moment, the frost Jade ice phoenixes were already approaching.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>At this moment, Bing Qing had repelled the frost Jade Ice Phoenix with a single strike and was charging towards Lu Ming and the rest. The group gathered and charged in a direction without the frost Jade Ice Phoenix.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>A total of nine frost Jade ice phoenixes chased after Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, flew tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye. However, the nine frost Jade ice phoenixes were still in hot pursuit.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was gloomy. They didn’t expect to be so unlucky. They had just entered and they had already encountered nine such terrifying frost Jade ice phoenixes.</p><p>“This won’t do. If we continue like this, the nine frost Jade ice phoenixes will catch up to us sooner or later. At that time, we’ll be surrounded and blocked. Only death will await us.”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Let’s split up,”</p><p>Bing Qing spoke and made her decision.</p><p>“Split up!”</p><p>The others ‘expressions also changed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
