They looked at Lu Ming as if he was an idiot.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and leave …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted.</p><p>go? where do you think you’re going? since you’re here, don’t leave.</p><p>Kang Ji laughed coldly. With a flash, he, situ haonan, and the rest surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>They could tell that Lu Ming’s starry sky warship was very advanced. Otherwise, he would not have been able to block the attack of the young man in embroidered clothes. Therefore, they blocked Lu Ming’s escape route so that he would not take out the starry sky warship and escape.</p><p>“Did I say I was going to escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his expression calm.</p><p>The ancestor of technique, the ancestral Dragon, and the others were slightly stunned. They knew Lu Ming very well and knew that he was not a rash person. He was so calm at the moment. Could he have something to rely on?</p><p>“Kid, I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>Mo kan, the Supreme elder of the underworld Hall, shouted and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The powerful attack of a fourth-stage true G.o.d was like a wave, crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique, ancestral Dragon, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s parents, Qiu Yue, and the rest were hidden in a secret place due to their low cultivation levels. They did not witness this scene. Otherwise, they would have been scared to death.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Mo kan sneered.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. Suddenly, a Spear’s gleam burst out and pierced towards the Baldacchino at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>All of mo kan’s attacks and defenses were as fragile as tofu in front of Lu Ming. The Spear’s gleam pierced through mo kan’s glabella, leaving a hole that was clear from the front and back.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Baldachen’s eyes were wide open. He could not believe what was happening in front of him. Then, with a Swoosh, his body fell to the ground and he was no longer breathing.</p><p>“He’s really weak …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Although they were all at the fourth stage true G.o.d Realm, mo kan’s combat strength was much weaker than an hai, Liu Chang, and the rest. With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could kill them with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, and the others “eyes were wide open as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>Lu Ming actually killed the Baldacchino in one move?</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>They gasped and felt cold all over. They broke out in a cold sweat and could not help but retreat, putting some distance between them and Lu Ming.</p><p>They were secretly glad that they weren’t the ones who had attacked just now. Otherwise, they would have been dead.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible …”</p><p>The ones who were the most shocked were Kang Ji, situ Xiao, and situ Feng. They had all fought with Lu Ming before and were well aware of his cultivation and combat strength.</p><p>But just now, Lu Ming actually killed mo kan casually. This was an existence at the fourth stage of true G.o.d. Lu Ming could actually kill a fourth stage true G.o.d existence? How many years had it been?</p><p>Their hearts trembled, and they were filled with jealousy.</p><p>“Gulp …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique, ancestral Dragon, t.i.tan Longhorn, and the others, as well as the people of the righteous Army, couldn’t help but swallow their saliva. They were tongue-tied and completely speechless.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s move earlier had shocked everyone.</p><p>“Didn’t you all want to kill me? Why are you retreating so quickly?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept towards Kang Ji and the rest as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s gaze swept across them, Kang Ji and the rest shivered.</p><p>kid, you have some combat strength. However, you are not arrogant enough in front of me.</p><p>At this moment, the young man in embroidered clothes spoke. Divine power gushed out of his body, exuding a powerful aura that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>we’ll know if it’s enough after we fight. However, once you do, you have to be prepared that I’ll be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming turned to look at the young man in embroidered clothes and said coldly.</p><p>I’m prepared to be killed by you. What a joke. A mere first stage true G.o.d wants to kill me? die!</p><p>The young man’s eyes were filled with a dense forest. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on Lu Ming. A terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming, trying to cut him in half.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled and swept out.</p><p>The spear radiance was as thick as a mountain range, and it collided with the young man’s saber radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the blade light shook violently and then collapsed. The spear light did not stop and continued to sweep toward the young man in embroidered clothes.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes roared in his heart. His eyes were filled with disbelief. Then, he exploded with all his strength to resist Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, when the spear ray pressed down, the young man in embroidered clothes screamed and his body flew out like a cannonball. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Many people rubbed their eyes, thinking that they had seen wrong.</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes was an inner disciple of the unique devil Academy. The strength that he had just displayed was simply astonishing. However, at this moment, he seemed to be unable to withstand a single blow from Lu Ming and was completely crushed.</p><p>Especially Kang Ji, situ haonan and the rest, they were almost scared to death.</p><p>The people of the righteous Army were ecstatic.</p><p>“Freak, freak …”</p><p>The person from the heaven realm muttered to himself. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>Previously, some people felt that although Lu Ming could create miracles in the heaven realm and was the strongest prodigy in the history of the heaven realm, it would be difficult for him to rise up in the primeval universe. He would be lost in the crowd. However, they realized that they were wrong. They were very wrong.</p><p>Monstrous, he was a monstrous wherever he went.</p><p>Lu Ming could create miracles in the heaven realm and he could do the same in the primeval universe.</p><p>They understood that Lu Ming’s current achievements had far exceeded their imagination.</p><p>“This rate of improvement is really …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s heart was also in turmoil and he could not calm down.</p><p>Lu Ming had only joined the Kong Xuan sect for a few decades. What did a few decades mean to a G.o.d?</p><p>However, Lu Ming had achieved shocking results.</p><p>“You want to kill me with just this bit of strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard again. Once again, he swept his spear at the young man in embroidered clothes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the young man in embroidered clothes was even more miserable. His body had been shattered, leaving only his head floating in the air. He was extremely frightened.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way …”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“No, don’t. You can’t kill me. I am an inner sect disciple of the unique devil Academy. If you kill me, you will also die …”</p><p>The young man in embroidered clothes roared, hoping to use the unique devil Academy to intimidate Lu Ming.</p><p>“Inner sect disciple of the unique devil Academy? I’m sorry, I killed a bunch of them a while ago.”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Although the luxuriously-dressed youth’s cultivation had reached the sixth stage of true G.o.d Realm, one stage higher than Liu shangkai’s, his combat strength was not as good as Liu shangkai’s. Naturally, he was completely crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go, sky-breaking!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, breaking through the air. A dazzling spear ray burst out and flashed past.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man’s head exploded, and his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, Kang long, situ Xiao and the rest were almost scared to death.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely audacious. He even dared to kill the inner disciples of the unique devil Academy. If they stayed, they would definitely die. They did not dare to stay any longer and fled frantically.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
