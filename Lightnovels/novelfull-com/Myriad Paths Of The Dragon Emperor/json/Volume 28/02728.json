All three geniuses of the unique demon Academy had been defeated.</p><p>Each of them had a gunshot wound on their chest. The wound went through their chest and blood was flowing out.</p><p>The three of them were pale and their breathing was weak. Their faces were filled with deep shock.</p><p>In that instant just now, they had almost thought that they were dead for sure.</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>It was one against three and Lu Ming had actually won. This combat strength could no longer be described as shocking. Even Bing Qing, who was experienced and knowledgeable, had a deep shock in her eyes.</p><p>The people from the other sects gasped.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to fight in the unique devil Academy?”</p><p>Lu Ming held the gun in one hand and swept his gaze across the people from the unique demon Academy. He was unparalleled in his demeanor.</p><p>I didn’t expect the Kong Xuan sect to have someone like you. That’s good. I’ll meet you personally today.</p><p>A cold voice sounded. It was the captain of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>He had been sitting in his seat the entire time. At this moment, he suddenly stood up from his seat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely terrifying aura burst out from this person, and a vast pressure filled the void.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Someone actually couldn’t withstand this pressure and directly sat on the ground.</p><p>Everyone felt as if a huge mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>“This aura …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a hint of solemnity.</p><p>The captain of the unique devil Academy was definitely a terrifying figure.</p><p>Stage five true G.o.d Realm. This was the cultivation that the team leader of the unique devil Academy had revealed. However, the feeling that he gave off was much stronger than the other stage four true G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>For example, even if an hai reached stage five true G.o.d Realm, it was impossible for him to give off such a strong pressure.</p><p>The divine power that this person controlled was divine grade divine power.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a top heaven’s favorite. His battle power wasn’t something that Hu ya could compare to. Hu ya was only at stage one true G.o.d, while this person was already at stage five.</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. His entire person was like a straight divine spear, showing off its sharp edge.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their auras collided in the air, and the air exploded like thunder. The terrifying pressure made all the seats shake as if they were going to explode at any time.</p><p>Many people hurriedly circulated their divine power to protect themselves. At the same time, they were on high alert. They knew that once Lu Ming started a fight with the team leader of the unique devil Academy, the destructive power would be extremely shocking.</p><p>The ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan looked around and suddenly stood up. He took a step forward and appeared between Lu Ming and the team leader of the unique demon Academy. An icy aura emanated from his body.</p><p>This cold aura was extremely terrifying, as if it wanted to freeze everything in the world. The aura of Lu Ming and the team leader of the unique devil Academy seemed to be frozen by this aura. They could not help but restrain their auras.</p><p>“What terrifying strength.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. Bing Qing’s strength was probably above the team leader of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“Can the two of you give me some face and forget about today’s matter?”</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>Previously, he did not stop them because he wanted to see their strength. However, the situation was getting more and more serious. If the Kong Xuan sect and the Yimo Academy were to fight, it would be disadvantageous for the mission later. Therefore, he stood up to stop them.</p><p>The unique demon Academy looked at Bing Qing with a grave expression. He could not see through Bing Qing’s cultivation, and it gave him a strong pressure.</p><p>“Kid, you’re lucky today. I hope your luck will always be this good.”</p><p>The team leader of the unique demon Academy cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. A wisp of killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>He was shocked that Kong Xuan sect had produced a prodigy like Lu Ming.</p><p>“We can’t let this person live.”</p><p>The team leader of the unique demon Academy thought.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was the leader of the top ten sects. Over the years, they had become more and more powerful and were already a threat to the three overlords. Therefore, a prodigy like Lu Ming could not be left alive. Once he grew up, he would be even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, then turned around and returned to his seat.</p><p>Bing Qing and the rest also returned to their seats.</p><p>thank you for coming today. I believe that everyone is curious about the mission this time. Now, I will briefly explain the mission.</p><p>the mission this time is to go to one of the ice Soul clan’s ancestral lands and retrieve a treasure called the ice jade heart. There are powerful restrictions on the way to the ancestral land, especially the time restriction. Only those under 10000 years old can enter.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. No wonder all the major sects sent people under ten thousand years old. So this was the reason.</p><p>Therefore, with the ice Soul clan’s strength, they would ask for help from the major sects. However, the ice Soul clan’s strength was limited when it came to prodigies under 10000 years old.</p><p>“There must be danger in your ancestral land, right?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>of course. It’s recorded in the ancient books that there are desolate beasts inside. Otherwise, the ice Soul Clan wouldn’t have paid such a huge price. If any of you are afraid and don’t want to go, you can go back now. The ice Soul Clan will send someone to send you back.</p><p>Bing Qing smiled.</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>They had already expected that there would be danger. Otherwise, the reward would not be so high.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was rewarded with 20000 points, and the other sects were offering similar rewards.</p><p>alright, since no one is backing out, we’ll leave in three days. Come, let’s drink.</p><p>Bing Qing smiled, and everyone began to toast and drink.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, everyone took their leave.</p><p>“You guys can go back first, I still have things to do.”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed an hai and the rest. An hai and the rest nodded and left.</p><p>Soon, only Lu Ming and a few members of the ice Soul Clan were left.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you have anything else?”</p><p>Bing Qing looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I do have something to ask you, ninth young lord.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He wanted to ask Bing Qing about the whereabouts of the Cold Moon Stone and if possible, buy some.</p><p>“Oh? You guys can leave!”</p><p>Bing Qing waved at the other members of the ice Soul Clan, and they left.</p><p>“Brother Lu, what’s the matter? please speak.”</p><p>Bing Qing Yi laughed.</p><p>“Ninth young master, Lu Ming would like to ask if the ice Soul Clan has Cold Moon Stones?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked directly.</p><p>“Cold Moon Stone!”</p><p>Bing Qing’s expression changed slightly before she nodded. “That’s right. The ice Soul Clan does have cold Moon Stones.”</p><p>“There really is!” Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Ninth young master, can you sell a few Cold Moon Stones to Lu Ming?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Sell it to you? This might not work.”</p><p>The ninth young master shook his head slightly.</p><p>“You can’t sell it?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>that’s right, brother Lu. To tell you the truth, the Cold Moon Stone is an extremely precious treasure even in the ice Soul Clan. Moreover, every piece used is one less piece. Even now, there are very few Cold Moon Stones in the ice Soul Clan. They’re all kept in the treasure vault by the important figures of my clan. It’s very difficult for me to get even one.</p><p>Bing Qing smiled bitterly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
