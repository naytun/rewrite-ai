Just now, I kept absorbing energy, and there’s still a lot of energy left in my body. Once I refine it, I’ll transfer it to you, and your cultivation will increase by another level.”</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming was about to burst out laughing.</p><p>This time, although the process was very dangerous, the harvest was also amazing.</p><p>His cultivation had increased to the second stage of true G.o.d Realm, and he had condensed the ancient G.o.d heart. His divine body was also several times stronger than before.</p><p>With the strength of his current divine body, it was already enough to cultivate the battle character formula to four times his combat power.</p><p>What a great harvest.</p><p>Lu Ming collected his thoughts and calmed down. He scanned the crowd and his gaze finally landed on the first elder.</p><p>At that moment, first elder was glaring at Lu Ming with a venomous look.</p><p>you don’t have to look at me like that. I have to thank you. If you didn’t send me into the formation, I wouldn’t have been able to condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The great elder was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood. It was too late for him to regret. His intestines were green with regret.</p><p>Previously, Gu Xiong had wanted to kill Lu Ming but he had insisted on sending Lu Ming into the formation. He had never expected that he would help Lu Ming instead, causing their plan to fail at the last step.</p><p>Gu Xiong was so infuriated that he almost died.</p><p>He regretted not killing Lu Ming with a single blow. If he had, he would have been the one to condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart.</p><p>However, there was no medicine for regret in this world. It was too late to regret now.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The place where the eight valleys congregated, along with the eight valleys, suddenly trembled violently. Even the ground shook violently.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d flowers that had covered the entire mountain had already dried up. Now, they had turned into ashes and scattered. However, the ground was still emitting a blinding light.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>&Nbsp; many of the ancient G.o.d descendants began to cry out.</p><p>Even Gu Xiong, Gu Bo and the others were at a loss, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>The shaking of the ground became stronger and stronger, and the light on the ground became stronger and stronger. There was even an extremely terrifying aura that burst out. It was filled with an ancient and imposing aura. It was as if a mountain was pressing on everyone’s body, and some people even almost spat out blood.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>retreat! Gu Bo shouted, calling for the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds to retreat.</p><p>Only after retreating a long distance did the pressure lessen.</p><p>“Senior Gu Bo, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood beside Gu Bo and asked curiously.</p><p>I don’t know. The gathering place of the eight valleys is the Holy Land of the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. All the time, the worship of the ancestors has been carried out here, but such a situation has never happened before.</p><p>Gu Bo frowned. He had lived for a long time, but this was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The ground where the eight valleys gathered shook more and more violently. Finally, a huge pillar of light shot into the sky.</p><p>There had been mysterious formations around the ancient G.o.ds Mountain, which was why it could be hidden from the outside world.</p><p>However, at this moment, the light pillar shot up into the sky and broke the formation around the ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>Once the formation was broken, the ancient G.o.ds Mountain would be exposed.</p><p>As for the light shield, it directly shot into s.p.a.ce.</p><p>The light beam was so bright that even those who were standing on another planet outside the ancient G.o.d Star could see it, let alone the ancient G.o.d Star itself. At least half of the people on the ancient G.o.d Star had seen the light beam, and countless people were looking in this direction.</p><p>“Then … What’s that?”</p><p>what a terrifying commotion. Could a peerless treasure have appeared? ”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>With a flash of their bodies, they rushed in the direction of ancient G.o.ds Mountain.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and the rest were dumbfounded.</p><p>Because at this moment, at the place where the light Valley gathered, a door was slowly emerging.</p><p>This was a huge bronze door that was 10000 Zhang in height. It stood tall between the heaven and earth, and there were many ancient G.o.dly spirits carved on it.</p><p>“This … Could this be the legendary ancient G.o.d sect?”</p><p>Gu Bo seemed to have thought of something and shouted in shock. His old body was trembling with excitement.</p><p>the gate of ancient G.o.d. It must be the gate of ancient G.o.d. The legendary gate of ancient G.o.d that leads to the world of ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>I didn’t expect the place where the eight valleys gathered to have a hidden ancient G.o.d’s Gate.</p><p>Gu Shang and Gu Ling also shouted excitedly, their eyes burning with excitement.</p><p>There was an ancient legend among the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>Legend had it that the gate of ancient G.o.d led to the world of the ancient G.o.ds. If one had the chance to enter the world of the ancient G.o.ds, one would have the chance to become an ancient G.o.d and become invincible in the world.</p><p>How could they not be moved by this?</p><p>the gate of ancient G.o.d that leads to the ancient G.o.d World? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked when he heard that.</p><p>The gate of ancient G.o.d appeared. It stood between the heaven and earth and gave off a blinding light. The gate of ancient G.o.d was made up of two bronze doors that were tightly shut.</p><p>However, as time pa.s.sed, the light on the gate of ancient G.o.d became dimmer and dimmer. Finally, the light disappeared, leaving only an ancient bronze door standing between the heaven and earth.</p><p>The vast pressure had also disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Gu Bo, Gu Shang, Gu Ling, and the others couldn’t stay calm. They rushed toward the gate of ancient G.o.d. The other descendants of the ancient G.o.ds followed closely behind, leaving only a few behind to guard the Grand Elder and the others.</p><p>Giggle! Giggle …</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu, which had been on Lu Ming’s wrist in the form of a bangle, turned into a round ball and floated in the air. A pair of eyes appeared on its eyeb.a.l.l.s and it stared at the gate of ancient G.o.d. Its mouth was wide open and it looked extremely excited.</p><p>“Little guy, what do you want to do?” Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>Giggle giggle …</p><p>QiuQiu’s big mouth kept closing, and its eyes were filled with greed as it stared at the door of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>“You … Don’t tell me you’re thinking of gnawing at that bronze door?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked speechlessly. He did not expect QiuQiu to nod continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s forehead was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>“Little fellow, don’t act rashly …”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed in a low voice. He took QiuQiu and flew toward the ancient G.o.d’s Gate.</p><p>Gu Bo and the rest had already landed below the gate of ancient G.o.d.</p><p>The gate of ancient G.o.d was huge. It was tens of thousands of feet tall and tens of thousands of feet wide. They were as small as ants before the gate of ancient G.o.d.</p><p>Gu Bo and the others tried to push the gate of ancient G.o.d open, but it was like an ant trying to shake a tree. The gate of ancient G.o.d did not move at all.</p><p>In the end, almost all the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds joined forces to push the gate of ancient G.o.d, but the result was the same.</p><p>Lu Ming also joined in but it was useless.</p><p>“Brat, don’t waste your time. This gate is extremely ancient and heavy. There is a great formation carved on it. You can’t open it with just your strength.”</p><p>Bone said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
