When he realized that nothing had happened, he became bold and shouted, ” “Brat, quickly let me go, quickly let me go …”</p><p>“Let you go? Tell your people to remove the formation and let me go. Also, give me 100 ancient G.o.d flowers, no, 500 ancient G.o.d flowers.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>500 ancient G.o.d flowers? impossible.</p><p>The young man roared.</p><p>“What do you guys say? Do you want him to die, or hand over the ancient G.o.d flower and let me go?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the young man. Instead, he looked at the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds on the cliff.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds all had ugly expressions.</p><p>“Kid, do you know who this person is? He’s the son of the Grand Elder, a descendant of an ancient G.o.d. If anything happens to him, you’ll have to die as well.”</p><p>An old man said coldly.</p><p>I don’t care whose son he is. If he doesn’t hand over the ancient G.o.d flower, I’ll throw him out and let him die in this formation.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He didn’t care whose son this young man was. The higher his status was, the better. That way, he could take the ancient G.o.d flower and leave.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>&Nbsp; the old man and the other ancient G.o.d descendants all had unsightly expressions.</p><p>These people looked at each other, not knowing what to do.</p><p>“Save me, save me!”</p><p>The young man roared.</p><p>“We have to report this to the Grand Elder or the patriarch before we can make a decision.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“There’s no need to report,”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Then, a tall old man with white hair and beard walked over.</p><p>Seeing the old man, the young man was overjoyed and shouted, ” “Father, father, save me!”</p><p>“We pay our respects to first elder …”</p><p>&Nbsp; the other ancient G.o.d descendants all saluted.</p><p>It turned out that this man was the great elder of the ancient G.o.d clan.</p><p>“This person’s cultivation is very high!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the first elder of the ancient G.o.d. The pressure he felt from this man was shocking.</p><p>It made Lu Ming feel as if he was facing the outer sect elders of the Kong Xuan sect. After all, the outer sect elders of the Kong Xuan sect were all at the sky G.o.d Realm.</p><p>This person was very likely to be a heavenly G.o.d existence.</p><p>The first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan looked gloomy. He looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “Quickly release my son, and I’ll let you go if I agree.”</p><p>Hearing this, the young man was ecstatic.</p><p>“Give me the 500 ancient G.o.d flowers, then remove the formation and let me leave. I’ll let her go then.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Let him go first.”</p><p>The head elder of the ancient G.o.d clan shouted coldly.</p><p>“Do you think it’s possible to let him go first?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He did not trust the other party.</p><p>“Kid, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.”</p><p>The first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan looked extremely gloomy and was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Hand over the ancient G.o.d flower, remove the formation, and let me go. I’ll naturally let you go. The conditions are simple.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The first elder’s expression changed. In the end, he said determinedly, ” “The secret of this place must not be leaked out. Wei ‘er, you can go in peace. I will avenge you.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The other party didn’t care about the life and death of the young man, not even his own son.</p><p>“No, no, father, no, save me …”</p><p>The young man roared madly.</p><p>“Continue to activate the formation. Also, send out experts to block this man’s path of retreat and prevent him from rushing out. This time, everyone who came in must die. Not a single one can be left alive.”</p><p>The Grand Elder of the ancient G.o.d clan gave the order. His eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The other ancient G.o.d descendants dashed toward the valley where Lu Ming and the others came from to prevent Lu Ming from escaping.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His eyes were cold as he stared at the first elder of the ancient G.o.d.”If you don’t even care about your own son, then I’ll fulfill your wish.”</p><p>With a single thought, the ice chains wrapped around the young man and sent him into the blood-colored mist.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Immediately, the sound of corrosion came from the young man’s body, and he screamed in pain.</p><p>Wei ‘er, don’t worry. I’ll avenge you. I’ll burn this kid’s bones and scatter his ashes. I’ll make him die a miserable death.</p><p>The Grand elder’s voice was extremely cold.</p><p>this old fellow. Could it be that he’s the one who set up this great formation …</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think.</p><p>He could not help but suspect that it was the great elder of the ancient G.o.d clan who had set up this formation to condense the heart of the ancient G.o.d Himself. That was why he did not care about his own son.</p><p>you don’t even care about your own son. I’ll fulfill your wish then.</p><p>Lu Ming threw the young man into the valley. The young man screamed and soon lost his breath. The first elder of the ancient G.o.d was full of murderous intent.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he was extremely wary of the blood-colored mist in the formation, he would have charged in and killed Lu Ming with a single slap.</p><p>activate the formation at full power. Let’s see how long he can last.</p><p>The Grand Elder of the ancient G.o.d clan ordered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Instantly, the runes in the surroundings shone with an even more dazzling light, and the blood-colored mist in the array became even thicker.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. In a flash, he disappeared into the fog and rushed toward the canyon that he had come from.</p><p>However, when he arrived, he found that the outside of the formation was surrounded by experts of the ancient G.o.d descendants.</p><p>“What a miscalculation …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This time, he had really miscalculated. He had not expected the first elder of the ancient G.o.d clan to be so cruel that he would not even care about the life and death of his own son.</p><p>Initially, he had planned to take the young man as a hostage and Exchange him for some ancient G.o.d flowers before leaving. Otherwise, Lu Ming might have succeeded if he had sneaked out of the valley from the beginning.</p><p>But now, it was too late.</p><p>The other side was surrounded by a large number of experts. If he were to attack from here, he would definitely die.</p><p>“I can only change my direction.”</p><p>Lu Ming dodged into the mist again and rushed toward another Valley.</p><p>There were a total of eight valleys here, and no one knew where the other seven led to.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly picked one. When he was close to the array, the ninth ice chain flew out and spun continuously with the head of the chain as the core.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The light shield of the formation was immediately broken and Lu Ming rushed out.</p><p>Naturally, there were descendants of ancient G.o.ds guarding this place. Lu Ming was discovered the moment he rushed out.</p><p>“This brat is here, stop him.”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, there were not many people here because most of them had gone to the valley that Lu Ming and the rest had entered from.</p><p>There were only seven or eight people here.</p><p>“The three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength to cast the three apocalyptic strikes. A crescent-shaped attack was launched.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Among these seven to eight descendants of ancient G.o.ds, the strongest was only at the eighth-stage true G.o.d Realm. Lu Ming broke through their defense in an instant and rushed out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
