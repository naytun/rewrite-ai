Moon-cutting!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cast the moon slash. One after another, the blood-colored pythons were destroyed.</p><p>Soon, the dozens of Blood Pythons all disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, the smugness on sanguine Rain’s face had completely disappeared and was replaced by shock, confusion, and disbelief.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can his Shen power not be exhausted?”</p><p>Sanguine rain muttered to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was shockingly powerful. It was definitely a unique skill. Such a move usually consumed a lot of divine power.</p><p>Even if he was outside, Lu Ming could not use it continuously. Furthermore, in his sanguine rain barrier, the speed of divine power consumption was several times faster than the outside due to the suppression of the barrier.</p><p>Logically speaking, Lu Ming’s divine power should have been exhausted.</p><p>But why was Lu Ming still so lively?</p><p>Sanguine rain was already dumbfounded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming broke through the blood Pythons ‘encirclement and finally struck the sanguine rain barrier.</p><p>The blood rain enchantment shook violently, but it didn’t break.</p><p>“I don’t believe it, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack, his long spear constantly blasting out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The blood rain enchantment kept shaking as if it was going to be broken at any time, but it managed to block it every time.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, with your cultivation, you can’t break my barrier. You’ll be beaten up pa.s.sively. I don’t believe that your divine power is endless. Even if I have to exhaust you, I’ll exhaust you to death.”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not blast the sanguine rain barrier open, sanguine rain laughed and finally felt relieved.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming could not break the sanguine rain barrier, he would be exhausted to death sooner or later.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More blood-colored sword gleams and blood-colored pythons appeared in the blood rain enchantment and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Just a little bit more, then … Four times the combat power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed as he activated his fourfold combat strength. At the same time, he swept his long spear to block the attacks of the blood-red sword gleam and blood-red python.</p><p>“Lu Ming is in a pa.s.sive position!”</p><p>that’s right, but his strength is really shocking. He’s been trapped in the blood rain barrier for so long and still has such battle power. It’s really terrifying.</p><p>indeed, sanguine rain is no match for him in a head-on collision. What a monster. Unfortunately, his attack power is still unable to break the sanguine rain barrier. He will eventually be defeated by sanguine rain.</p><p>“It’s a bit of a pity!”</p><p>In the sanguine rain enchantment, as long as the enchantment could not be broken, the sanguine rain could take the initiative and stand in an invincible position, exhausting the opponent to death.</p><p>Many people felt that Lu Ming’s fate was sealed since he could not break the sanguine rain enchantment. He would lose without a doubt.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Sanguine Rain’s body continued to burst with blood-red divine power, raising the power of the sanguine rain barrier to its peak. Countless blood-red sword Qis and blood-red pythons charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a low rumble came from Lu Ming’s body. The fighting spirit in his body suddenly increased.</p><p>The battle formula had been successfully activated.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and cast the moon-cutting move again. However, the power this time was much stronger than before.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A crescent-shaped attack burst out, and all the blood-red sword light and blood-red pythons were destroyed.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>After Lu Ming destroyed the blood-red sword gleam and the blood-red python, he swept his long spear out again.</p><p>This time, it was aimed directly at the blood barrier.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion. Then, the blood rain enchantment was pierced through, split into two, and exploded.</p><p>“You, how is that possible?”</p><p>Sanguine rain roared in shock. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Ming clearly could not break the sanguine rain barrier earlier. How did he manage to do it again in the blink of an eye?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had been hiding his abilities?</p><p>“Not good, retreat, retreat …”</p><p>Reacting, sanguine Rain’s figure retreated frantically.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming allow him to retreat? he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he quickly chased after the blood rain and attacked with the moon-cutting technique.</p><p>The sanguine rain enchantment shattered and was no longer within the enchantment. The speed of the sanguine rain had been reduced by many times. It could not compare to Lu Ming at all and could not avoid Lu Ming’s attacks. It could only resist with all its might.</p><p>A blood-red armor appeared on his body, covering his entire body. Then, a sword appeared in his hands, and he slashed out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack landed on sanguine Rain’s combat sword. Sanguine Rain’s combat sword trembled violently and finally exploded with a bang.</p><p>This was a middle-grade divine artifact, but it was shattered by Lu Ming. Sanguine Rain’s figure retreated rapidly and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. He was severely injured.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat …”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to launch another attack and kill sanguine rain in one fell swoop, sanguine rain hurriedly shouted.</p><p>He felt that he would definitely not be able to withstand Lu Ming’s next move. When the next move was unleashed, he would die. If he did not admit defeat now, when would he?</p><p>Sanguine rain admitted defeat and Lu Ming had no choice but to stop.</p><p>Sanguine rain quickly retreated from the fighting ring, blood still spurting out of his mouth. A deep wound appeared on his chest. Even his armor had cracked, and his bones could be seen.</p><p>This was all thanks to Lu Ming’s move just now.</p><p>“Sanguine rain has lost!”</p><p>my G.o.d, stage three true G.o.d actually defeated an expert on the real G.o.d ranking list. This is too heaven-defying!</p><p>Many people gasped in shock.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others were also shocked. They looked terrified.</p><p>Lu Ming was too heaven-defying. In a few more years, they would have nothing to do with the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Even the Supreme Holy Son, who had been calm all this time, became extremely serious.</p><p>amazing. Lu Ming is too amazing!</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng muttered to themselves.</p><p>“Boss is mighty!”</p><p>In the crowd, an hai, Liu Chang, and a few others were also watching. At that moment, their eyes were shining, and they were abnormally excited.</p><p>They had already submitted to Lu Ming. The stronger Lu Ming was, the happier they would be.</p><p>As for the outer sect disciples, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Some people looked down on Lu Ming when he first joined the sect. However, they were not even fit to carry his shoes now. Moreover, only a few decades had pa.s.sed.</p><p>“Are there any more battles? Hurry up and come down!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the fighting ring and shouted.</p><p>At this moment, his combat strength was at its peak, and he didn’t want to waste any time.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others all looked gloomy.</p><p>Xue Yu was the strongest true G.o.d in the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction. He had no one else to send.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection and the others had some subordinates, but they were not confident that they could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had completely crushed sanguine rain after the battle.</p><p>Therefore, no one made a move for a while.</p><p>Was Lu Ming really going to become the eighth Saint of Kong Xuan sect today?</p><p>Many people had such thoughts.</p><p>“Long Xian, you can make your move.”</p><p>At this moment, a majestic voice rang out. It was the Supreme Holy Son.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
