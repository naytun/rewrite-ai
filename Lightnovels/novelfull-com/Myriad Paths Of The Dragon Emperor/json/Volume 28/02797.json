He was probably comparable to a genius who could control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>“How is it? Isn’t he amazing?”</p><p>QiuQiu’s proud voice rang out.</p><p>“Interesting, again.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a strong desire to fight. He kept triggering the battle formula, wanting to trigger a fourfold combat power.</p><p>come on. I’ll tell you. My strength is not limited to this. QiuQiu waved its two ‘arms’, as proud as it could be.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After dozens of times of triggering, Lu Ming finally triggered the quadruple combat strength.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming really exerted his full strength and used the moon slash.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current abilities, he could probably suppress long Xian if he used this move at full force. Its power was shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed at QiuQiu.</p><p>“I’m coming!”</p><p>QiuQiu cried out and retracted its arm. Its round body turned rapidly and smashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>It was another terrifying collision. The crescent-shaped spear light collided with QiuQiu’s body.</p><p>At the moment of collision, the crescent-shaped Spear’s gleam shook violently and shattered. Then, QiuQiu’s body hit Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook violently. He felt a terrifying force surging towards him. He felt as if he had been hit by a planet.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flew out once again and hit the wall of the courtyard.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt as if all the bones in his body were about to break.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>QiuQiu asked with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s just a small injury. What’s the big deal?”</p><p>Lu Ming braced himself. How could he lose face in front of QiuQiu?</p><p>“QiuQiu, is this all your strength? It’s really powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. QiuQiu’s power was probably close to the heavenly G.o.d-level. It was really shocking. He was no match for it even if he went all out.</p><p>of course not. I still have another power that I haven’t used.</p><p>QiuQiu said complacently. After it finished speaking, sizzling sounds came from the surface of its body, and wisps of lightning appeared.</p><p>“It’s this kind of lightning …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This lightning was exactly the same as the lightning on the bronze door back then, but it was much thinner.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to try the power of my lightning?”</p><p>QiuQiu blinked its big eyes and said. There was a hint of ill-intention in its eyes.</p><p>“I’ll try it, come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very confident in his defense.</p><p>With a thought, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around him. Then, nine layers of Scarlet Gold armor appeared on his body.</p><p>He was fully armed.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re ready?”</p><p>QiuQiu asked in a low voice.</p><p>of course. Cut the c.r.a.p. Come on, you can’t hurt me.</p><p>Lu Ming had a look of confidence.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Bolts of lightning emerged from QiuQiu’s body and then gathered into a bolt of lightning as thick as an arm. It rushed towards Lu Ming at an alarming speed and hit Lu Ming in the next moment.</p><p>Then, there was an extra person in the courtyard. His body was charred black, his hair was in a mess, and smoke was constantly rising from his body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright? You’re the one who wanted to try it …”</p><p>QiuQiu said, a little scared.</p><p>“I’m not … I’m fine, how could I be?”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>He had never expected that the lightning QiuQiu had triggered would be so powerful.</p><p>His ice chains and Scarlet Gold armor couldn’t withstand it at all. They crumbled in an instant, and the terrifying lightning directly scorched his body.</p><p>At the critical moment, QiuQiu had probably gone easy on him. Otherwise, he would have been in an even more miserable state.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming was excited.</p><p>The power of QiuQiu’s lightning was absolutely comparable to that of a heavenly G.o.d. Some of the weaker heavenly G.o.ds might not even be this strong.</p><p>The stronger QiuQiu was, the happier Lu Ming would be.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming consumed a divine healing pill to recover from his injuries. He then washed up and changed into a new set of clothes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, are you there?”</p><p>At this moment, Yue Linglong’s voice came from outside. From her voice, she seemed to be quite anxious.</p><p>QiuQiu transformed into a bracelet and put it on Lu Ming’s hand. Lu Ming walked out of the courtyard.</p><p>“Lady Yue, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is bad. An hai, Liu Chang, Zhao Feng and the others have been beaten up. They’re seriously injured …</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“He was beaten?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Who did this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I don’t know yet. I came to you after I got the news. Zifeng went to see them first.</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and flew toward the residence of an hai and the others.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and Yue Linglong arrived at an Hai’s residence. They pushed the door open and smelled the stench of blood.</p><p>&Nbsp; an hai, Liu Chang, and Zhao Feng were all here, but they all looked very miserable.</p><p>Liu Chang and Zhao Feng were lying on the ground, their faces pale and their breathing weak. Lu Ming could tell with a single glance that their bone armor had been broken.</p><p>An hai was the most miserable.</p><p>Half of his body had exploded and blood was flowing out. His internal organs could be seen.</p><p>At this moment, Wu Zifeng was helping an hai heal his injuries.</p><p>“Boss …”</p><p>An hai struggled to bow when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t move. Recuperate properly …”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly stopped him. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>The person who had done this was extremely vicious. If they were not in the Kong Xuan sect, where the other party did not dare to violate the sect rules and kill, an hai and the others would have been dead.</p><p>Even so, an hai and the others had probably suffered quite a bit.</p><p>Fortunately, an hai and the others ‘injuries weren’t fatal. With their divine bodies, they could recover very quickly.</p><p>A few hours later, Liu Chang and Zhao Feng’s bones had all been set back and their auras had stabilized.</p><p>An Hai’s exploded body was also healing rapidly, and new flesh and blood grew.</p><p>“Who did this?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>An hai, Liu Chang, and Zhao Feng’s expressions froze, and they looked at each other.</p><p>“Boss, we’re fine. Let’s just forget about this matter!”</p><p>An hai said.</p><p>“Let’s just forget it? How can I just let this matter go? in the future, will anyone in the Kong Xuan sect still take me seriously?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He knew that an hai and the rest were doing this for his sake. However, Lu Ming would not let it go.</p><p>“Who did this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Boss, it’s still …”</p><p>An hai wanted to persuade Lu Ming to stop.</p><p>I’m asking you to say it in the name of the Saint. Who did it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s tone was more serious and his voice was cold. An Hai’s words came to an abrupt end.</p><p>Finally, an hai sighed and said, ” “It was Liu Feiyun.”</p><p>“Liu Feiyun?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He had never heard of this name.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
