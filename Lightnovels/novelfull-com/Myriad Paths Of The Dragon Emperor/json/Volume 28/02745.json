It was indeed the red flame tribe, and there were a lot of them. There were actually 70 or 80 of them.</p><p>Only those who were below 10000 years old could enter. The number of people from the red flame tribe had reached 70 to 80, which showed how powerful they were.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming and the rest were not the Scarlet Flame tribe. However, there were more than seventy of them.</p><p>These people were from different races.</p><p>“The indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land!”</p><p>A young man from the unique demon Academy exclaimed. The hearts of the others also sank.</p><p>They could all tell that these young people were from different races. Just like them, they were from the other seven sects and powers of the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>In addition, the geniuses of the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land had also come.</p><p>Everyone’s heart sank.</p><p>The difference in power between the two sides was too great.</p><p>They had fought several fierce battles in the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land and lost some of their combat forces. Originally, they had less than 100 people. Now, after losing some, they were only left with about 60 people.</p><p>On the other hand, the total number of people on the other side was about 150, more than twice their number.</p><p>“Bingqing, hand over all your storage rings and I’ll let you go.”</p><p>A burly heaven’s favorite of the red flame race sneered. His body was like a burning piece of iron, emitting wisps of divine fire. His power was astonishing.</p><p>“Yan Sen, if you have the ability, then come and take it yourself.”</p><p>Bing Qing said coldly as the coldness around her became stronger and stronger.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan had obtained the ice jade cold heart after so many years. How could he give it away?</p><p>“If you don’t want to hand it over, then did you really obtain the icy jade chilling heart? Today, none of you will leave. Attack!”</p><p>The brawny young man of the red flame tribe, Yan Sen, waved his hand and gave the order.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The paragons of the Scarlet Flame race, the immortal sword sect, and the other sects shouted. Their auras surged as they charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>let’s gather together and charge forward. As long as we can get out of this path, we’ll be saved!</p><p>kill! Bing Qing roared and took the lead, charging towards the red flame tribe.</p><p>Beams of sword Qi bloomed from Bing Qing’s hands. They were extremely cold, and everywhere they pa.s.sed, layers of frost appeared.</p><p>“Small tricks, transform!”</p><p>die! Yan Sen shouted as he charged towards Bing Qing. His body was covered in flames, and the temperature of the air rose rapidly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>He kept swinging his fists, sending lava-like fist shadows towards Bing Qing. The air was filled with sizzling sounds and violent rumbles.</p><p>Circles of hot and cold energy spread out.</p><p>The two of them fought. Yan Sen’s combat strength was also extremely terrifying, and he was tied with Bing Qing.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming and the rest were also under terrifying attacks.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>A few screams were heard.</p><p>The difference in strength between the two sides was too great. As soon as they exchanged blows, Lu Ming’s side suffered heavy injuries and a few of them were killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest’s charging formation was also stopped.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword resounded through the sky. A young Man in Black with a cold expression and terrifying combat strength slashed out with his sword, killing a genius of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>This was a heaven’s favorite from the indestructible sword sect. His strength was slightly stronger than Liu shangkai’s.</p><p>On the other side, a white-robed young man was extremely refined. However, his combat strength was also extremely terrifying. In a single exchange, he had also killed one person.</p><p>This person was from the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there were a few paragons in the Scarlet Flame tribe who were not weaker than Liu shangkai. Some of them were even stronger than Liu shangkai. Under the leadership of these people, Lu Ming’s side was forced to retreat and people were killed one after another.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An expert from the red flame tribe threw a punch and turned a disciple from the Kong Xuan sect into ashes.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had sent a total of ten heaven’s favorites. They had not died before, but now, they were the first to die.</p><p>this can’t go on. We’ll split up and leave in groups. Follow me, ” w.a.n.g Yao said.</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>Given the current situation, Lu Ming could no longer care about the ice Soul Clan. He led the people from the Kong Xuan sect and charged wildly to the side. Lu Ming was at the forefront. He burst out with all his strength and kept stabbing with his long spear.</p><p>Two Scarlet Flame tribe youths were a.s.sa.s.sinated by Lu Ming in a row. The other Scarlet Flame tribe youths coughed up blood and retreated.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A young expert of the Scarlet Flame tribe had his eyes on Lu Ming and was charging toward him.</p><p>He was wearing a pair of Crimson gloves. He threw a few consecutive punches, and the scorching fist force crushed toward Lu Ming. Before the fist force arrived, everyone felt as if their bodies were burning.</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands swept out continuously and collided with the person. However, the result was that Lu Ming was forced to retreat a few steps.</p><p>“What powerful battle prowess.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame tribe’s combat strength was not any weaker than Liu shangkai’S. Lu Ming was at a disadvantage in a head-on collision.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to kill the people of my red flame race? die!”</p><p>The young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe said ferociously and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming gave it his all to fight against the other party. An hai and the rest formed a circle to block the attacks from all directions. However, the situation was still precarious.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe exchanged more than ten moves in an instant. In the end, Lu Ming kept retreating and was completely suppressed.</p><p>“Brat, turn to ashes!”</p><p>The young man from the red flame tribe roared and punched madly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, an ice chain flew out of his body and wrapped around the other party.</p><p>“Just a mere chain, melt it!”</p><p>The young man from the red flame tribe said coldly. He did not care about the ice chains at all. He threw a punch, and a hot flame shot toward the ice chains, trying to melt them.</p><p>However, the ice chain was completely fine and pa.s.sed through.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The young man from the red flame tribe was shocked. He didn’t expect that his fist force would have no effect on the ice chain. While he was stunned, the ice chain had already wrapped around him and quickly tightened.</p><p>“Transform …”</p><p>die! the young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe shouted and exploded. His body was like a furnace. The temperature was so high that it was about to melt the ice chains.</p><p>However, the ice chain was not affected at all. It quickly tightened. The terrifying coldness extinguished the flames of the young man from the red flame tribe. Then, a layer of ice covered the young man.</p><p>“Impossible, no no…”</p><p>The young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe shouted in horror. He never dreamed that Lu Ming could control such a terrifying ice that he could even freeze his flames.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
