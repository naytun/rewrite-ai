No matter how serious his injuries were, he could recover quickly. His vitality was astonishingly strong, and he was known for his immortality.</p><p>However, it was only effective for those below the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation level had reached seventh tier void G.o.d Realm, his divine body was extremely powerful. Now that he was injured, using the indestructible heaven’s scroll to heal his injuries would not have any effect at all.</p><p>It was the same for the healing elixir.</p><p>If it was useful to experts with high cultivation, its value would naturally be greater.</p><p>The rainbow divine stone could be used to refine divine pills that were useful to even sky-G.o.ds. One could imagine how valuable it was.</p><p>“Kid, wait, don’t go over!”</p><p>At this moment, the sound of the ‘quant.i.ty’ formula suddenly rang out. Lu Ming jumped and hurriedly called out, ” “Wait a moment, don’t go over there yet!”</p><p>Because at this moment, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were approaching the altar to pick up the rainbow divine stone.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were shocked by Lu Ming’s shout and stopped in their tracks.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked.</p><p>Shaking his head, Lu Ming did not say anything. In fact, he did not know what was in front of him.</p><p>there’s a large array in front. Once you step in, you’ll probably be trapped by the large array! The quant.i.ty formula said.</p><p>“Another formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. The Grand array of the primeval universe was far more profound than the heaven realm and the primordial realm. With Lu Ming’s attainments in array techniques, he could not see through it at all.</p><p>“If there’s a formation, how do we get the dark Dragon blood jade?”</p><p>Lu Ming used his spirit to ask the question formula.</p><p>“Of course we have to find the formation core and break the formation. Hey, boring battle, you were familiar with that guy ‘formation’ back then, so you should have some understanding of the formation Dao, right? can you break the formation core and find it?” The quant.i.ty formula against the battle formula.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.’Array’? Could it be another ‘formation’ from the ancient word of origin?</p><p>Just by hearing it, one could tell that it had an unbelievable effect on the Dao of formations.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense, I’m looking for it!” The deep voice of the battle symbol art sounded.</p><p>“Hey, what are you saying? What nonsense? Make it clear to me today, or else I won’t let you off!” The ” quant.i.ty ” formula shouted. The entire character bounced as if it was going to pounce on the ” battle ” formula.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. One word could actually give birth to such a weird character.</p><p>The battle symbol art was too lazy to pay attention to the quant.i.ty symbol art. It seemed to be sizing up the formation, looking for a way to break it.</p><p>“Hahaha, someone finally came!”</p><p>At this moment, a burst of laughter suddenly rang out in the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were shocked. They did not expect that there would be someone else in the cave.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted. The three of them looked behind the altar.</p><p>At this moment, a figure walked out from behind the altar.</p><p>This person had actually been hiding behind the altar all this time. Just now, the altar had blocked this person’s figure, and his aura had been concealed very well. They had not discovered him at all.</p><p>This was a young man who looked to be in his twenties. He was very handsome and had an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>Moreover, the aura from this person’s body was extremely powerful. He was also an existence at the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Someone had already entered this place.</p><p>“Fellow junior brothers and sisters, I am Kong Zhi Xing!” The young man cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“What? You said you’re a star of s.p.a.ce? It’s impossible!” Yue Linglong cried out in disbelief when she heard the name.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng were a little surprised. Why did Yue Linglong have such a big reaction when she heard this name? she even looked as if it was impossible.</p><p>“This Junior Sister, I am indeed a s.p.a.ce Star!” The young man smiled.</p><p>“Ling Long, who’s the star of the sky?” Wu Zifeng asked.</p><p>100000 years ago, the No. 1 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list of the Kong Xuan sect was called Kong Zhi Xing. However, 100000 years ago, when the dark Dragon secret realm opened, Kong Zhi entered the dark Dragon secret realm and never returned. Everyone thought that he had died!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>the No. 1 virtual G.o.d ranking list from 100000 years ago! Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng’s eyes flickered. Could this person really be the star of the sky?</p><p>junior brothers and sisters, I’m indeed a s.p.a.ce Star. I entered the dark Dragon secret realm 100000 years ago, but I didn’t die. I just wanted to get the treasures here, but I missed the time to get out!</p><p>junior brothers and sisters, you’ve come at the right time. There’s a rainbow G.o.dstone and a Dark Dragon blood jade on this altar. They’re priceless treasures, but they’re hard to take off. You’ll help me take them down and we’ll split them evenly!</p><p>Said empty star.</p><p>don’t believe him. There’s a formation here. This kid is trapped by the formation. Once you get close to the altar, you’ll be trapped by the formation as well. You’ll share his burden, so he’ll have a chance to break through the formation!</p><p>The quant.i.ty formula called out.</p><p>The ” quant.i.ty ” formula had been around for countless years. Although he was not good at formations, he still had a good eye.</p><p>“Wait a moment!” Lu Ming stopped Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng, who were about to make a move. He then looked at the empty star and said, senior brother Kong, since these rainbow divine stones and dark Dragon blood jade are so difficult to retrieve, why don’t you leave with us first and call for more helpers to help us? it’ll be much easier that way.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“The treasures are limited,” said empty star.”If we call more people, how will we split it?” Junior brothers and sisters, don’t hesitate. I’ve studied this altar for a hundred thousand years and am very familiar with it. As long as we work together, we’ll definitely be able to take the treasure.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were a little surprised by Lu Ming’s half-smile.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to hurry up and help me?” The empty star called out, clearly a little impatient.</p><p>“Hehe, you don’t have to shout. I can already see that there’s a large formation here. You’ve been trapped by this formation and can’t get out at all. That’s why you’ve been trapped for a hundred thousand years. If we go forward, we’ll also be trapped by the formation. At that time, we can help you share the pressure and you can escape, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What?” Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s faces changed.</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing’s face darkened. He did not expect Lu Ming to see through his intentions.</p><p>stop guessing. Hurry up and come over. Let’s take the treasure together! Kong Zhi Xing’s voice started to get louder. It was filled with unquestionable authority. He was the No. 1 on the void G.o.d Realm ranking and the No. 1 in the outer sect. Of course, he had his own authority. At that time, very few people in the outer sect dared to disobey him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng were all extraordinary people. They would not give a d.a.m.n about him.</p><p>Not only did the three of them not advance, but they also took a few steps back.</p><p>“Good, very good. If you don’t want to come in, then I’ll pull you in!”</p><p>Kong Zhi Xing said coldly. He completely lost his temper and a powerful aura exploded from his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
