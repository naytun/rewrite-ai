He even retracted his demonic wings, because they were also covered with a layer of frost.</p><p>“This is a good place. Let’s go deeper.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he retracted the divine power of Absolute Frost. Immediately, Lu Ming’s body was covered in a layer of frost. He looked as if he had almost been frozen into a snowman. He trembled as he continued to fly deeper into the canyon.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, Liu shangkai thought that Lu Ming would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>“Hmph, the cold Qi here is so terrifying. I don’t think you can resist it even if you’re at the eighth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm. This place will be your grave.”</p><p>The killing intent in Liu shangkai’s eyes turned even colder. He continued to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Soon, they were deep in the canyon. The cold air here was even more terrifying.</p><p>“What is under the water? It’s actually emitting such terrifying cold Qi?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. He was a little curious. At the same time, he slowed down.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted coldly and launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he had to resist the cold air outside, so the power of his attacks was naturally much weaker than outside.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die.”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly turned around, his eyes as cold as a knife. He circulated the ultimate cold divine energy and blocked the cold air outside.</p><p>Then, all his divine power burst out and attacked Liu shangkai.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few explosions, a figure was pushed back. It was Liu shangkai.</p><p>“You … How did you use your full strength?”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted in shock.</p><p>&Nbsp; in this place, the cold energy was too terrifying. If one used divine power to block it, one’s body would quickly be frozen, and if one used divine power to block it, one’s combat power would be bound to weaken.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attack power was not weak at all.</p><p>no, you’ve mastered the divine power of extreme cold. How is this possible? you didn’t use the divine power of extreme cold just now …</p><p>Thinking of this, Liu shangkai cried out even more in shock and disbelief.</p><p>A single person could actually control several Shen powers at the same time.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. Once again, he charged at Liu shangkai.</p><p>The spear light was like a rainbow, revealing a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>“You want to kill me? dream on.”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared. Runes appeared all over his body, making him even stronger.</p><p>He conjured a huge, pitch-black Cauldron and hurled it at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was a pity that he still had to use a part of his divine power to resist the cold air outside and could not unleash his full power. He was at a disadvantage in the collision with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The pitch-black Seal shattered, and Liu shangkai was sent flying backward while vomiting blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and attacked Liu shangkai frantically.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The energy surged and the water on the lake churned, stirring up thousands of waves. Some of the lake water fell on the surface of Lu Ming’s body, and a bone-piercing chill instantly filled Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but shiver.</p><p>One must know that Lu Ming was circulating the ultimate cold divine energy at the moment, but he still felt so cold. The temperature of the lake water was shockingly low.</p><p>If Lu Ming was already in such a state, Liu shangkai was naturally in a worse state.</p><p>He was splashed by the lake water, and his body turned into an ice block. Even his divine power was frozen.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared and burned his divine power. His divine power burned like fire, melting the ice and removing the coldness.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attack had arrived. A Spear’s gleam was aimed at Liu shangkai’s vital point. He roared and dodged the attack, but his chest was still pierced by the Spear’s gleam and his body flew far away.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you better remember this …”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared, stretched out his demonic wings, and turned to run.</p><p>He knew that he would not be able to kill Lu Ming today. If he continued to stay, he might really die Here.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase.</p><p>However, Liu shangkai was burning his divine power with all his might at the moment. His speed was astonishing. Lu Ming did not manage to catch up with him for a while. Liu shangkai rushed out of the canyon very quickly.</p><p>After rushing out of the canyon, Liu shangkai spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. His aura was weak, and he was heavily injured.</p><p>He didn’t dare to stay any longer. He turned into a streak of light and flew into the distance.</p><p>“It’s a pity that this guy got away.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. He sighed to himself.</p><p>Liu shangkai flew all the way. Not long after, he met the other people from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>When the other people from the unique demon Academy saw that Liu shangkai was injured, they were shocked.</p><p>“Senior brother Liu, what’s wrong? where’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming has been killed by senior brother Liu?”</p><p>The disciples of the Yimo Academy spoke one after another.</p><p>Liu shangkai’s face turned even gloomier, ” “Lu Ming is still alive. He’s very cunning and is hiding in a dangerous place. I was. .h.i.t by him accidentally. I’ll find a place to recuperate first.”</p><p>The others were shocked when they heard that. It turned out that Lu Ming was not dead. He seemed to have tricked Liu shangkai and injured him.</p><p>Immediately, they found a hidden place to stay.</p><p>Liu shangkai did not reveal that Lu Ming controlled several types of divine powers. He had his own selfish motives and wanted to kill Lu Ming in secret to seize that kind of cultivation technique.</p><p>“To be able to control several divine powers at the same time, what kind of divine technique is this? I have to get it. ”</p><p>Liu shangkai’s eyes glowed with a cold light. He swallowed a divine pill and began to heal.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming did not leave the canyon. He was curious about the cold air in the canyon and decided to explore it.</p><p>Lu Ming went deeper into the canyon. The deeper he went into the canyon, the thicker the cold air became. If he did not cultivate cold-attribute divine power, it would be difficult to resist it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the divine power of frost and could block it.</p><p>Soon, they reached the end of the canyon, which was cut off by an ice wall.</p><p>The cold air here was the thickest, and it was constantly emitted from the lake.</p><p>“There must be something underwater. Let’s go down and take a look.”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and then circulated the ultimate cold divine power, covering it with all his strength, and plunged into the lake.</p><p>The moment he entered the lake, Lu Ming shivered again. The temperature in the lake was shockingly low.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still blocked it and slowly dived down.</p><p>The surface of the lake was not very deep, only about a hundred meters. Very soon, Lu Ming reached the bottom of the lake.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming reached the bottom of the lake, he noticed something strange. There was a ball of snow-white liquid at the bottom of the lake. It was the size of a fist and was suspended in the water, emitting a shocking chill.</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that the source of the chilliness here was this ball of liquid.</p><p>what kind of liquid is this? it’s actually filled with such a shocking chill? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully but he did not recognize it at all.</p><p>“This is most likely a treasure, I can’t miss it.”</p><p>Lu Ming approached it slowly. There was nothing unusual. Then, he took out a storage ring. A force of attraction appeared and enveloped the liquid, successfully storing it into one of the storage rings.</p><p>As soon as the liquid was taken away, the temperature in the area rose rapidly. The chill was greatly reduced and it was not as cold as before.</p><p>That liquid was indeed the source of the chill here.</p><p>“I’ll study it after I bring it back.”</p><p>Lu Ming held the storage ring in his hand and was prepared to take it back to study it slowly. However, at this moment, a scene that shocked Lu Ming appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
