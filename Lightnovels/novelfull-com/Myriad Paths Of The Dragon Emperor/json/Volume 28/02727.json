This is your combat power?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a disdainful look at Hu ya, his voice full of mockery.</p><p>I don’t believe that with my true G.o.d Realm cultivation base, I would lose to an ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. Roar! Tear me apart!</p><p>Hu ya’s eyes were blood red as he roared. The Shen power in his body boiled and his body swelled up. He had gained a full circle of weight.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A tiger’s roar shook the entire scene. Hu ya transformed into a half-human, half-Tiger existence. With a stomp of his feet, he pounced at Lu Ming like a gust of wind.</p><p>This was a secret technique of the Tigermen race. When used, one’s combat strength would increase by a large margin.</p><p>Many special races had their own innate secret techniques. Only those of that race could use them, and they had all kinds of profound mysteries.</p><p>This was something that the human race could not compare to.</p><p>Lu Ming became a little more serious. He stood up, a long spear condensed in his palm, and he swept it out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge spear ray swept towards Hu ya.</p><p>“Tear!”</p><p>The Tiger’s teeth roared. His nails were like blades as he continuously clawed at the spear radiance.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had collided dozens of times. Hu ya’s expression changed drastically, and with a m.u.f.fled groan, his body was thrown back. In mid-air, blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>A disciple of the unique demon Academy soared into the sky, caught Hu ya, and fell to the ground.</p><p>Hu ya spat out a large mouthful of blood, his aura weak. He had already suffered heavy injuries and was unable to continue fighting.</p><p>“Can’t even withstand a single blow.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Hearing Lu Ming’s words, Hu ya spat out another mouthful of blood. He was so angry.</p><p>He had always thought that the reason he had lost to Lu Ming during the qintian thirteen clan a.s.sessment was because his cultivation had been suppressed. If his cultivation had not been suppressed, he could have crushed Lu Ming to death with a single finger.</p><p>He did not expect that after a few decades, he would be so vulnerable in front of Lu Ming. He was easily crushed by Lu Ming. It was really hard for him to bear.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to injure the disciples of my unique devil Academy? how dare you. Let me fight you.”</p><p>With a loud roar, a bald young man rushed out of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>The aura that the bald young man exuded was extremely shocking. He was a fourth-stage true G.o.d genius, and his cultivation was no weaker than an Hai’s.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bald young man rose into the air and his legs were like steel whips, sweeping toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person’s leg technique was extremely impressive.</p><p>Before the leg reached him, the terrifying force was already pressing down on Lu Ming with an overwhelming force.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and collided with the bald youth’s leg, causing a violent boom. The bald youth’s figure drifted backward, while the long spear condensed by divine power in Lu Ming’s hand trembled non-stop and almost collapsed.</p><p>“There’s a divine artifact on his leg!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. The other party was wearing a Golden Boot. It was a divine weapon with shocking power. Lu Ming did not use the divine weapon just now, so the long spear condensed by divine power almost collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and a divine spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Heaven-fixing foot, heaven-fixing strike!”</p><p>The bald young man took a step back and stabilized himself in the air. Then, he charged at Lu Ming, kicking out with both legs. His entire body was like a drill, blasting towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming launched an air-piercing strike. A dazzling spear radiance collided with the bald youth. The force spread in all directions. The bald youth was pushed back tens of thousands of meters. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was injured.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The others widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually injured the bald young man.</p><p>The bald young man was a fourth stage true G.o.d and was also a heaven’s pride expert. His combat strength was far from what Hu ya could compare to. However, such combat strength was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>An eighth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert could suppress a fourth-level true G.o.d Realm heaven’s favorite. What kind of freak was this?</p><p>Everyone finally knew why Lu Ming was able to become the team leader of the Kong Xuan sect. It was because he had the ability.</p><p>Previously, an hai had said loudly that Lu Ming could become the team leader of the Kong Xuan sect because he was the most powerful. However, no one believed him at that time and thought that an hai was just bragging.</p><p>Now, they knew that what an hai said was the truth.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Hu ya could not believe his eyes.</p><p>He controlled the sacred-grade divine power and prided himself on being a peerless talent. To him, it was a common occurrence to fight those of a higher level. However, he realized that he was nothing compared to Lu Ming.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>The pupils of the team leader of the unique devil Academy also contracted, and he revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>This level of combat strength was truly shocking. Even the divine sons of the three Overlord forces wouldn’t have such terrifying combat strength in a battle of the same level.</p><p>“Interesting, very interesting.”</p><p>Bing Qing, the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, had a glint in her eyes.</p><p>“The geniuses of the unique devil Academy are only so-so.”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>kid, don’t be arrogant. I’ll fight you!</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>The geniuses from the unique demon Academy were furious. Immediately, two young men rushed up and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>These two young men were also at the fourth stage true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The Yimo Academy was indeed worthy of being one of the three Overlord sects in the Qin heaven star region. They were indeed powerful and had four fourth stage true G.o.d geniuses.</p><p>It should be known that only an hai and the long-faced young man were at true G.o.d stage four in Kong Xuan sect. Of course, it could not be ruled out that there were geniuses from the major sects who had cultivated for less than ten thousand years. It was just that they had not come.</p><p>However, this also showed how powerful the unique devil Academy was.</p><p>The two fourth-stage true G.o.d geniuses, one on the left and one on the right, launched a fierce attack on Lu Ming. Their divine skills had been cultivated to the third stage and the power was very shocking.</p><p>At the same time, the bald young man from before also burst out with all his strength. His feet stepped in the void and his figure appeared above Lu Ming. He looked down from above and stomped down.</p><p>The three experts joined forces to deal with Lu Ming and launched their strongest attack at the same time. The power of the attack changed drastically.</p><p>Even an ordinary stage five true G.o.d or even stage six true G.o.d would be terrified and avoid the attack, let alone an eighth-stage ethereal G.o.d.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm.</p><p>At this moment, his fighting spirit soared into the sky, and an even stronger power burst out of his body.</p><p>The battle formula, which tripled his combat power, was activated.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>With the enhancement of the battle character formula, which tripled his combat power, Lu Ming cast the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had stabbed three times.</p><p>The three spear shadows rushed up and split into three directions, piercing toward the three young geniuses of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion, and it was as if three stars had exploded in the sky.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. In the midst of his howl, the three figures retreated rapidly, flying thousands of meters away, their bodies covered in blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
