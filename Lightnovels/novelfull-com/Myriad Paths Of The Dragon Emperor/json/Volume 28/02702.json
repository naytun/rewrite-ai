If they split it evenly, each of them would get more than two hundred points, which was more than twenty thousand points.</p><p>Lu Ming was not far from 50000 points.</p><p>However, they still had one more thing to do, and that was to dig out the netherdragon’s beast core.</p><p>They could just keep the Dragon Bone of the Dragon Bone flower, but they would have to dig out the netherdragon beast’s beast core.</p><p>“Let’s start work!”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes narrowed into slits as she smiled. She picked up the sword and started digging.</p><p>The three of them worked together and collected the beast cores one by one.</p><p>However, at this moment, a ray of rainbow light charged toward Lu Ming at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>His roar shook the entire Valley. The force swept through like a storm and slashed at Lu Ming like an extremely sharp blade.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>At the side, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng cried out in alarm, but it was too late for them to help.</p><p>“Danger, danger …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s entire body tensed up. His hair stood on end as he felt an extremely dangerous aura.</p><p>He did not have time to think. Almost subconsciously, he cast the nine-stage Crimson Gold armor. A Crimson Gold armor covered Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge claw covered in scales scratched the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor, making a loud noise. The Crimson Gold armor shook violently, and cracks immediately appeared on it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flew out like a cannonball and hit the wall of the canyon, creating a huge pit.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale. At the same time, he could finally see what had attacked him.</p><p>Nether Dragon, another nether Dragon!</p><p>Moreover, this spirit Dragon beast was twice as large as the other Spirit Dragons. Its eyes were blood-red, and its aura was cold and terrifying. It glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng finally reacted. Their figures flashed and they stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and flew out of the pit. He stood side by side with Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng.</p><p>Luckily, he managed to activate the ” nine stage Crimson Gold armor ” in time. Luckily, his ” nine stage Crimson Gold armor ” had already broken through and reached the second stage. Otherwise, he really wouldn’t have been able to block the netherdragon’s attack.</p><p>The attack of that spirit Dragon beast was shockingly powerful. It was more than five times stronger than the other spirit Dragon beasts they had encountered before.</p><p>it’s the netherdragon beast King!</p><p>Wu Zifeng frowned.</p><p>netherdragon beast King!</p><p>Lu Ming and Yue Linglong’s eyes lit up. The nether Dragon beast King’s beast core would definitely be worth more points.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King’s body was surrounded by a faint Halo. It kept growling, and its eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the nether Dragon beast King’s four limbs stomped on the ground. Its body stirred up a gust of wind as it pounced toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Yue Linglong was the first to attack. Her figure flashed and she swept forward, her sword stabbing towards the neck of the nether Dragon beast King.</p><p>However, the nether Dragon beast King was extremely agile. With a slight twist, it avoided the attack on its neck. Yue Linglong’s long sword stabbed into the scales of the nether Dragon beast King, causing sparks to fly. It did not break through the nether Dragon beast King’s defense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the netherdragon beast King extended its sharp claws and grabbed towards Yue Linglong.</p><p>Yue Linglong’s expression changed slightly, and she quickly retracted her sword to block it. The two of them exchanged a blow, and Yue Linglong’s figure drifted back.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King roared and wanted to chase after Yue Linglong, but Wu Zifeng had already arrived. The long sword in his hand bloomed with sword light and stabbed toward the nether Dragon beast King.</p><p>However, the nether Dragon’s sharp claws continued to swing out like sabers, blocking Wu Zifeng’s sword light.</p><p>The two sides collided for more than a dozen times, and both retreated.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng was shocked.</p><p>The cultivation of this netherdragon beast King should be at the first stage of the true G.o.d Realm, but its strength was actually not weaker than his.</p><p>It should be known that Wu Zifeng was a top genius. His divine power was a sacred grade divine power, and his combat power was far beyond his peers. However, this nether Dragon beast King could fight him head-on.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming had also rushed over. At this moment, he had triggered the battle character formula to triple his combat strength and raised his abilities to the peak.</p><p>the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-breaking!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used his strongest move. The sword radiance expanded and pierced the nether Dragon’s neck as if it could shatter the void.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon roared and turned its head to avoid being hit in its vital parts. It took Lu Ming’s attack head-on with its head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a terrifying boom. Lu Ming was pushed back by a force and he retreated quickly. However, the nether Dragon beast King was also pushed back.</p><p>A shallow crack appeared on its forehead, but it was not cut open.</p><p>Its defensive power was too shocking!</p><p>Lu Ming’s all-out attack could not even break through the defense of the netherdragon beast King.</p><p>the nether Dragon beast King’s defense is too strong. We can’t break through it with our attacks. We can only kill it by attacking its vital points. We can restrain it together and then take the opportunity to attack its vital points!</p><p>Wu Zifeng transmitted his voice to Lu Ming and Yue Linglong. Lu Ming and Yue Linglong nodded. The three of them formed a triangle and surrounded the netherdragon beast King.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King was not afraid at all. Its eyes became even more ferocious. With a roar, it pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King kept staring at Lu Ming. It was obvious that it was because of the nether dragon blood Curse.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared fearlessly and charged at the netherdragon beast King.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng also made their moves. They used their divine skills and attacked the netherdragon beast King.</p><p>The two sides started a chaotic battle.</p><p>In terms of offensive power, the three of them working together could completely suppress the netherdragon beast King. However, the netherdragon beast King’s defense was too shocking. It only needed to avoid its neck and let Lu Ming and the others attack its other parts. Then, it would seize the opportunity to counterattack.</p><p>Therefore, the two sides were tied for a while. After exchanging dozens of moves, there was no clear winner.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Zifeng, I’ll use my full strength to trap it. You guys take the chance to attack its vital parts!”</p><p>At that moment, Yue Linglong sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng. Then, she waved her hand and kept the combat sword, replacing it with two soft whips.</p><p>“Heaven and earth net!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted. Her hands formed a divine gesture. The two soft whips were like two long snakes dancing. They interweaved and formed a huge net that enveloped the nether Dragon beast King.</p><p>In an instant, the nether Dragon beast King was covered in it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast King let out a deafening roar and started to struggle violently. It waved its sharp claws, causing the giant net to twist and shake.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted.</p><p>“Heavenly Star Strike!”</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng used their strongest killing moves at the same time, aiming for the nether Dragon beast King’s vital points.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
