Then, everyone was shocked.</p><p>A large group of people had appeared on the cliffs of the valley.</p><p>These people held large bows in their hands and stood on the cliff wall, surrounding them.</p><p>“Trespa.s.sers of ancient G.o.ds Mountain will die!”</p><p>On the northern cliff, there was a young man with a cold expression. He spoke coldly.</p><p>“You guys … Are you a descendant of an ancient G.o.d?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>Descendants of ancient G.o.ds?</p><p>Didn’t the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds disappear for countless years?</p><p>It was said that the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had been exterminated, leaving only the ancient G.o.ds Mountain. Was that all fake?</p><p>Could it be that the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had been hiding in the ancient G.o.ds Mountain all these years?</p><p>Since the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds hadn’t been destroyed, why hadn’t they appeared after so many years?</p><p>Many people’s minds were filled with questions.</p><p>However, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds obviously wouldn’t answer their questions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>On the northern cliff, the young man waved his hand and gave the order.</p><p>Instantly, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds drew their bows and nocked their arrows. One after another, arrows whistled through the air and shot toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>After all, the ancient G.o.d flower was protected by a formation, so they weren’t afraid of hurting it.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>People were constantly shot by the arrows and died on the spot, blood flowing all over the ground.</p><p>Many of these descendants of ancient G.o.ds had astonishing strength. Most of them were at the true G.o.d Realm, and the arrows they shot out had astonishing power.</p><p>Other than the domain lord level ones, no one else could block it 100%.</p><p>I don’t care if they’re the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. Charge forward and kill them.</p><p>Someone shouted and rushed up the cliff, attacking the descendant of the ancient G.o.d.</p><p>“You overestimate yourself. Get down!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>On the cliff wall, some burly figures appeared. Their muscles bulged like horned Dragons winding around them, full of power.</p><p>The strength of these people was very shocking. The moment they attacked, the sky shook violently.</p><p>Those who charged towards the cliff were all jolted down, even those at the domain lord level.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and dashed toward the eastern cliff like a long spear.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>A middle-aged man charged at Lu Ming and threw a few consecutive punches. The terrifying force of his punches crushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Strong, shockingly strong.</p><p>Although this middle-aged man was only in the true G.o.d Realm, he had definitely reached the peak of stage nine true G.o.d Realm. His battle strength was not weaker than le Zhong’s, and he might even be stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with all his strength and swept his long spear horizontally. However, the fist force of the other party came crushing down. Lu Ming’s body retreated rapidly as if he was being crushed by a mountain and he fell down into the valley.</p><p>“What a powerful strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming felt numb all over. The qi and blood in his body were boiling, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>&Nbsp; he realized that his opponent’s divine power was not too bad, but the strength of his divine body was astonishing. It was much stronger than other cultivators.</p><p>When they worked together, their combat power would be very strong.</p><p>A descendant of an ancient G.o.d. Lu Ming was certain that the other party was a descendant of an ancient G.o.d.</p><p>According to the legends, when the primeval universe was first created, a group of ancient G.o.dly spirits were born naturally. These ancient G.o.dly spirits could be said to be the earliest life forms in the primeval universe. The earliest G.o.dly spirits were born with terrifying power.</p><p>In particular, their divine bodies were freakishly strong. The earliest and most ancient G.o.ds were ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds on the ancient G.o.d Star, as their name suggested, were said to be the descendants of an ancient G.o.d. Although their bloodline was extremely thin, their divine bodies were still stronger than ordinary people.</p><p>For a moment, no one could rush out of this place.</p><p>Behind them, there were still people rushing over.</p><p>Soon, more than 10000 people who had entered the ancient G.o.ds Mountain had all gathered here.</p><p>“Almost everyone’s here, so let’s send them on their way,”</p><p>On the northern cliff, the young man said coldly. Then, he raised his arm high and his voice resounded throughout the entire area, ” activate the formation and kill all the intruders. su mo ordered.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>After that, dense runes appeared on the cliff walls in all directions.</p><p>The ancient G.o.d flower’s roots beneath their feet were also covered in runes.</p><p>Countless runes interwove with each other, forming a large formation.</p><p>The area was enveloped by a blood-red light shield. Lu Ming and the rest were all enveloped by this light shield.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds were outside the light barrier.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically, and they had a bad feeling in their hearts.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>attack! someone shouted. He no longer cared about the ancient G.o.d flower and rushed toward the valley they had come from. All sorts of attacks were launched at the light shield.</p><p>However, when these attacks landed on the light shield, they did not cause any ripples. The light shield did not move at all.</p><p>“Attack! Attack!”</p><p>More people joined in the attack, but it was of no use.</p><p>“Hehe, these fools still want to escape. Once you enter this formation, you’re destined to die Here.”</p><p>The young man on the northern cliff laughed coldly.</p><p>“It’s starting!”</p><p>Said an old man next to the young man coldly.</p><p>At this moment, some blood-red mist suddenly appeared within the formation’s light barrier.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Someone let out a blood-curdling scream as the blood-red mist enveloped him. His body began to corrode violently. His flesh and blood were melting rapidly, and in a few breaths, he had turned into a pool of liquid.</p><p>The people who witnessed this scene were so frightened that their livers and guts trembled.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>But immediately, more screams were heard. More blood-red mist emerged from the ground. Some people were shrouded in the blood-red mist and followed in the footsteps of the previous person.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, charge out!”</p><p>“I don’t want to die!”</p><p>&Nbsp; everyone roared and crazily attacked the light barrier, but it was to no avail.</p><p>Within the light shield, the blood-red mist grew thicker and thicker.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Lu Ming was enveloped by a blood-red mist. He used all his divine power to resist it, but even if it was the ruler’s divine power, there was a sizzling sound of corrosion. If this went on, he would not be able to resist for long.</p><p>This mist was extremely terrifying. Even divine power would find it hard to resist.</p><p>Those with strong cultivation and above stage seven of true G.o.d could still resist for the time being. As for those with weak cultivation, they couldn’t resist at all. Their protective divine power was corroded, and their bodies were corroded by the blood-red mist. They let out mournful cries and then turned into a pool of blood-red liquid.</p><p>In the beginning, it was those below stage three true G.o.d who couldn’t withstand it. However, as the blood-red mist became thicker and thicker, slowly, those who were stage four true G.o.d and above also started to be unable to withstand it.</p><p>let me out, let me out! I don’t want to die!</p><p>“Spare me!”</p><p>Many people screamed and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>However, the descendants of the ancient G.o.ds had cold expressions and were unmoved.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
