It even started to block one’s line of sight, and the power of the fog also became stronger and stronger.</p><p>More and more people were melted into liquid. Strangely, the liquid quickly seeped into the ground and seemed to be absorbed by the ancient G.o.d flower. The flower became more and more beautiful.</p><p>More and more people died. More than ten thousand of them had entered, but now, there were less than five thousand left. People were dying every second.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by blood-red mist. His divine power was constantly being corroded.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had the ” measure ” formula and stored a large amount of divine power. He could always maintain his divine power at its peak. However, this was not a solution. No matter how much divine power he stored, there would be a moment when he would run out.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly thought of countermeasures.</p><p>amazing, he actually set up such a large array. The descendants of the ancient G.o.ds are very ambitious.</p><p>The black skeleton spoke again.</p><p>“Senior, what did you see?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Although this formation is profound, with this old man’s knowledge, I can naturally see through it with one look.”</p><p>there’s an ancient G.o.d flower planted in every eye of the formation, ” the black skeleton continued proudly. it’s for something big.</p><p>these ancient G.o.d flowers will fuse with the formation and absorb a large amount of flesh and blood to complete the formation. When that happens, the person who set up the formation will absorb everyone’s ancient G.o.d flowers and condense the ancient G.o.d heart.</p><p>what a vicious method. Could it be that we were able to come in because someone deliberately tricked us in? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. At this moment, he thought of many things.</p><p>Why did so many maps of ancient G.o.ds Mountain appear on the ancient G.o.d Star at the same time? it was obvious that someone had deliberately attracted all the experts on the ancient G.o.d Star.</p><p>Then, he would lure them here, kill them, and let the ancient G.o.d flower absorb their blood and flesh.</p><p>After being reminded by the black skeleton, Lu Ming suddenly figured out everything.</p><p>The reason why they could enter ancient G.o.ds Mountain was because someone had deliberately arranged it. The person who had arranged all this was the descendant of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>senior, what is the ancient G.o.d’s heart? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>let this old man tell you. These so-called descendants of the ancient G.o.ds actually have extremely thin bloodlines. They can’t even be considered descendants of the ancient G.o.ds. Only those who have condensed the ancient G.o.d’s heart can be considered true descendants of the ancient G.o.ds.</p><p>with the ancient G.o.d’s heart, one’s divine body can keep getting stronger. Their fighting power is amazing. These people can’t compare to them.</p><p>The black skeleton explained.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>however, it’s not that easy to condense the ancient G.o.d’s heart. I’m afraid it’s not enough to do so with just the flesh and blood of you people.</p><p>The black skeleton said.</p><p>“If it’s not enough, then what’s the point of luring us here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>if my guess is correct, then the person who set this up must have sacrificed a large number of ancient G.o.d descendants in order to condense the ancient G.o.d heart. Tsk tsk, what a ruthless method.</p><p>The black skeleton clicked its tongue, as if it was quite appreciative.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was greatly shocked.</p><p>&Nbsp; he even needed to sacrifice a large number of ancient G.o.d descendants and slaughter his own race to help him. This kind of method was really vicious.</p><p>hehe, these descendants of the ancient G.o.ds are probably still in the dark. They don’t know that they don’t have long to live.</p><p>The black skeleton chuckled.</p><p>“Senior, how are we going to get out? if this continues, I won’t be able to hold on for much longer.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In just a short while, the blood-red mist here had become shockingly thick, and their vision was getting worse and worse. When they looked up, they could hardly see the figures on the cliff.</p><p>More and more people died.</p><p>The remaining people were all extremely frightened.</p><p>d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it! I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die …</p><p>Le Zhong roared in his heart, his face extremely ferocious.</p><p>He had never expected that he would put himself in such a dangerous situation when he came to hunt down Lu Ming.</p><p>Although his cultivation was at the peak of stage nine true G.o.d Realm and he could still resist for the time being, he would still die if time pa.s.sed.</p><p>He was extremely frightened.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve already saved you several times. How can I just watch you die Here? in the future, I still have things I need you to do.”</p><p>The black skeleton said.</p><p>“How many times have you saved me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>Didn’t he just remind him before that le Zhong wanted to kill him? that was only once.</p><p>“Nonsense. When you were surrounded by the demonic bloodthirsty tree in the forest, who saved you? That fellow, Jing Yu, only has a wisp of his imprint left. How could he have the power to save you?”</p><p>The black skeleton berated.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>Back then, when he had just joined the Kong Xuan sect, he had gone to the forest with Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and a few others to train. They had encountered a group of terrifying bloodthirsty demon trees in an abyss, and they were completely no match for them.</p><p>At that time, Jing Yu’s portrait had flown out and scared the bloodthirsty demonic tree away.</p><p>It turned out that the black skeleton was making a move.</p><p>“Wait a minute, if he referred to Jingyu as that fellow, then he’s not Jingyu.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. Previously, he had guessed that the black skeleton was Jing Yu’s transformation.</p><p>“Junior thanks senior for saving me. May I know how to address senior?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You can just call me Bone Devil.”</p><p>The black skeleton said indifferently.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, how can I escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The mist from this formation is powerful, but I’ll transfer some of my power to you, enough to block the mist from the outside. However, let me tell you, I don’t have much power left, so don’t expect me to help you if you encounter danger in the future.”</p><p>Bone warned.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately expressed his grat.i.tude.</p><p>Let’s talk about it after we get through the current difficulties. It’s not too late to talk about the future.</p><p>At this moment, the bone demon’s body glowed and a jet-black energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A layer of black light immediately emerged on the surface of Lu Ming’s body, completely blocking the blood-red mist outside and isolating him from the world.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pressure was greatly reduced and he was relieved.</p><p>However, this scene was seen by le Zhong who was not far away.</p><p>this kid can actually completely isolate the blood-red mist. Treasure, this kid must have a treasure on him. I’m going to take it.</p><p>Le Xin roared in his heart, his eyes revealing a greedy look.</p><p>He thought that Lu Ming had some kind of treasure on him that could resist the blood-colored mist outside.</p><p>If he could seize it, he might be able to live.</p><p>He rushed toward Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>“This old fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed le Zhong as well. A strong murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Kid, hand over your treasures.”</p><p>He lowered his voice in fear of being heard by others and competing with him.</p><p>“Hand over your sister! Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and attacked with all his might.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
