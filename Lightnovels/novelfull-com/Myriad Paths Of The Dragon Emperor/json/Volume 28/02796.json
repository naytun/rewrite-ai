In the end, a flame appeared.</p><p>The fire of the mysterious divine power had been successfully condensed.</p><p>The sixth divine fire appeared in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>Of course, this divine fire had just been formed and was still very weak. If he wanted to raise it to the same size as the other divine fires, he would still need to cultivate diligently for a period of time.</p><p>This could not be rushed.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped cultivating at this point.</p><p>He began to practice the divine skill, the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>That was because after the series of battles, Lu Ming felt that the three apocalyptic strikes were about to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a long spear and started to cultivate in the courtyard.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear danced in the air like a real Dragon swimming in the courtyard. However, all of the power was condensed into the long spear, and not a single bit of it leaked out.</p><p>“Sky-breaking, moon-cutting …”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the first and second moves of the three apocalyptic strikes over and over again, taking turns. Gradually, Lu Ming’s understanding of the three apocalyptic strikes reached a peak.</p><p>After a few days.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Lu Ming shook the long spear and it streaked across the sky. A crescent-shaped spearlight flew into the sky and disappeared.</p><p>“I’ve broken through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally broken through to the fifth stage of the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>After breaking through to the fifth level, whether it was the first form, sky-piercing, or the second form, moon-cutting, the power had increased by a level.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at stage three true G.o.d Realm. It was absolutely shocking that he could cultivate his divine skill to stage five at this cultivation level.</p><p>For example, le Zhong’s cultivation base was at the peak of true G.o.d Realm. He had been stuck in the true G.o.d Realm for countless years, but he had only cultivated his divine skill to the peak of stage four.</p><p>People who didn’t have enough talent, at the true G.o.d Realm, most likely could only cultivate to the fourth stage of the divine skill.</p><p>Only a few extremely talented experts could rise to a higher level.</p><p>For example, long Xian had cultivated his G.o.d technique to the fifth level.</p><p>“Now, if I go all out, I’m afraid I can defeat long Xian.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident smile.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed and he looked in QiuQiu’s direction.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu’s body was emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>This aura was extremely shocking.</p><p>Fortunately, the courtyards where the inner disciples lived were protected by a large formation that could isolate the aura. Otherwise, this aura would definitely alarm others.</p><p>this aura is so shocking. QiuQiu is breaking through to the second stage of true G.o.d Realm. No, third stage true G.o.d Realm …</p><p>Sensing QiuQiu’s aura, Lu Ming was initially overjoyed. In the end, he was shocked and his eyes widened.</p><p>That was because QiuQiu’s aura had risen too quickly.</p><p>Originally, QiuQiu’s cultivation was at the first stage of true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>At this moment, it quickly rose to the second stage of true G.o.d Realm. After a while, it rose to the third stage of true G.o.d Realm and then the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm …</p><p>It wasn’t over yet. Its aura was still rising.</p><p>Stage five true G.o.d Realm, stage six true G.o.d Realm …</p><p>It only stopped when it reached stage eight true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>He had advanced from the first stage of true G.o.d Realm to the eighth stage of true G.o.d Realm in a short while. This speed was even faster than riding on an interplanetary warship. It would be strange if Lu Ming was not dumbfounded.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied, thinking that he was dreaming.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu finally reacted. It turned its round body, and its expression was shiny and sparkling.</p><p>A pair of eyes and a big mouth appeared on his body, revealing a satisfied expression.</p><p>QiuQiu, you broke through to the eighth stage true G.o.d Realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, I am.”</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Eh, you can speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“No, I’m talking to you with my mind.”</p><p>The ball continued.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and then nodded.</p><p>QiuQiu’s cultivation was so high that it was normal for it to be able to communicate with him. One must know that in the heaven realm, even martial King realm demonic beasts could speak.</p><p>QiuQiu was very strange, but it was at the true G.o.d stage after all, so it was normal for it to communicate with its thoughts.</p><p>eighth level true G.o.d, he actually directly broke through to eighth level true G.o.d. That piece of bronze door’s fragment is also too heaven-defying, right?!</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>It was obvious that QiuQiu had swallowed a small fragment of the bronze gate on the ancient G.o.d Star, which had caused its cultivation to skyrocket.</p><p>It was only a small fragment, but QiuQiu’s cultivation had actually increased so much. If it swallowed the entire bronze door, what realm would QiuQiu advance to?</p><p>Would he be able to reach the divine King realm?</p><p>Or even more?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning with pa.s.sion. But then, he shook his head helplessly.</p><p>He had asked around before and found out that the bronze door had not been opened yet.</p><p>Currently, there were countless experts gathered at the bronze door. There were even many Divine King experts.</p><p>Moreover, the major sects had invited a few formation Masters to study and crack the formation on the bronze door. He couldn’t get close to the bronze door at all.</p><p>He could only think of a way in the future.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to have a spar?”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice was heard again. Two tentacles extended from its body like arms and it looked at Lu Ming ‘arrogantly’.</p><p>“This guy, good. Come, come, let’s exchange pointers!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He also wanted to know how strong QiuQiu was after breaking through to the eighth tier of true G.o.d.</p><p>“Be prepared, I’m afraid I’ll hurt you,”</p><p>QiuQiu’s ‘arrogant’ voice continued.</p><p>“This fellow is really confident …”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and then circulated his divine energy with all his might.</p><p>In his dantian, six divine flames started to burn.</p><p>Although the mysterious divine fire had just been condensed, it was still useful in increasing Lu Ming’s divine power.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming activated the battle formula and his combat power was tripled.</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at QiuQiu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>QiuQiu’s round body charged at Lu Ming. One of its arms transformed rapidly into a huge hammer and smashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The hammer smashed out, and a violent explosion rang out in the air.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed the moment QiuQiu attacked. He did not dare to be careless.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A spear ray collided with QiuQiu’s hammer, creating a violent boom.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook violently. His body shook violently and he was sent flying like a cannonball, crashing into the wall of the courtyard.</p><p>Runes appeared on the walls of the courtyard, blocking Lu Ming.</p><p>Fortunately, the courtyard was protected by a large array. Otherwise, the courtyard would have exploded.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s arms ached. The web between his thumb and forefinger was split open and blood was flowing out.</p><p>After the collision, Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>The power of QiuQiu’s move just now was extremely terrifying. It was definitely not weaker than long Xian’s all-out attack.</p><p>QiuQiu is only at stage eight true G.o.d, but its power is so strong. Its power can probably be compared to prodigies who can control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
