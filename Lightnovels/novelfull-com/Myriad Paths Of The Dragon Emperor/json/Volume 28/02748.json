He thought he was dreaming.</p><p>Not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming with a single blow, but Lu Ming had also broken through. He felt that his mind was in a daze.</p><p>“Liu shangkai …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept toward Liu shangkai. He did not even bother to conceal his cold killing intent, causing Liu shangkai to shiver.</p><p>Liu shangkai, I have to thank you. If not for your attack just now, I wouldn’t have broken through, hehe!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He wasn’t lying. The situation just now was indeed like that.</p><p>On the contrary, Liu shangkai’s attack had become a boost to Lu Ming, allowing his cultivation base to break through to the true G.o.d-level in one go.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, Liu shangkai almost spat out a mouthful of blood out of anger.</p><p>Not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming with one strike, but he even became Lu Ming’s a.s.sistant, helping him to break through his cultivation level. He wished he could give himself a few tight slaps.</p><p>“To ‘repay’ you, I will personally send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>so what if you’ve broken through? kill!</p><p>The young man from the Scarlet Flame tribe, who was more than three meters tall, roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>He unleashed his full power and threw two punches. Two scorching hot fist forces crushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Facing this attack, Lu Ming’s expression was cold and he swept his spear out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear and the fist force collided, and the fist force directly exploded. The spear light didn’t stop and continued to attack the red flame Tribe Youth who was more than three meters tall.</p><p>&Nbsp; the other party’s expression changed as he tried to block, but in the end, he retreated and his arms exploded into pieces.</p><p>“Your strength?”</p><p>The three-meter-tall young man of the red flame tribe widened his eyes in disbelief.</p><p>In one move, Lu Ming had only casually waved his spear and he had severely injured him.</p><p>Lu Ming had just broken through to true G.o.d-level. Why did his strength increase so much?</p><p>A person’s battle power was not only determined by the strength of their Shen power, but also by Shen skills, secret skills, and so on.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through, he did not have a breakthrough in his G.o.dly skills. It was impossible for his combat strength to increase so much.</p><p>He had no idea that Lu Ming had five divine fires in his body and five types of divine power. Once his cultivation level broke through, the five divine fires and five types of divine power would all break through. Naturally, his divine power would increase greatly.</p><p>His combat strength had also increased by several times.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. He held the long spear and charged towards the Scarlet Flame tribe.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Rays of terrifying spear radiance burst forth. They were much stronger than before.</p><p>The young men of the red flame tribe, including the one who was more than three meters tall, tried their best to resist.</p><p>However, the spear light went through the red flame tribe’s young man, who was more than three meters tall, and all six of the red flame tribe’s top Warriors were killed.</p><p>All of them were a.s.sa.s.sinated by Lu Ming.</p><p>The three-meter-tall young man from the red flame tribe also coughed up blood and retreated. His injuries were even more serious.</p><p>“This, this …”</p><p>Liu shangkai was almost scared to death when he saw this.</p><p>Among the Scarlet Flame race’s prodigies who had been killed earlier, there were some who were not weaker than him. However, Lu Ming had killed them easily.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Liu shangkai roared in his heart and turned to leave.</p><p>“Go, where do you want to go?”</p><p>How could Lu Ming let Liu shangkai escape? he would not kill the others, but Liu shangkai must die.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he gave chase to Liu shangkai.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, he was too fast when he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. He caught up to Liu shangkai in a few flashes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you dare to kill me, the unique devil Academy will not let you off …”</p><p>Liu shangkai shouted hysterically.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and swept his spear out.</p><p>A huge spear light swept toward Liu shangkai.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Liu shangkai bellowed. His entire body was covered in runes. He was going all out. He burned all his divine power and condensed a big black Seal, which blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the strongest attack he had ever used, and he only wanted to save his life.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge seal and Lu Ming’s Spear’s gleam collided. The huge seal shattered immediately while the Spear’s gleam swept across Liu shangkai’s body. Liu shangkai let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying and crashed into a huge meteorite. Many of the bone armor on his body had been broken. He was already on the verge of death from his severe injuries.</p><p>When Lu Ming was at eighth-tier void G.o.d Realm, he was not Liu shangkai’s match in a head-on confrontation. However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation base had broken through to first-tier true G.o.d Realm, and his combat strength had skyrocketed. He could already crush Liu shangkai.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way …”</p><p>He looked at Liu shangkai coldly and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Liu shangkai let out a shrill cry. At that moment, he regretted his actions. He regretted ambushing Lu Ming. Not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming, but he also helped Lu Ming achieve a breakthrough in his cultivation. He even lost his life.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.</p><p>The long spear stabbed out, and Liu shangkai was killed.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed young man from the eternal sword sect screamed in horror and turned to run.</p><p>The others followed.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. The divine power in his body erupted, and his fighting spirit soared.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a G.o.d of War. He held a long spear in his hand and slaughtered his way through.</p><p>The spearlight continued to shoot out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In an instant, ten members of the Scarlet Flame tribe, six members of the winged demon Academy, and six members of the immortal sword sect were killed.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame tribe that had besieged an Hai’s group had been completely annihilated.</p><p>At this moment, there were only three people left from the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>An hai and the other two with the highest cultivation were covered in injuries. The others were all dead.</p><p>This was also the result of the experts of the Scarlet Flame tribe. If they had besieged Lu Ming, an hai, and the others, their combat strength was not particularly strong. Otherwise, none of them would have survived.</p><p>The three of them looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack the people from the Scarlet Flame tribe, the eternal sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>Exhilarating, extremely exhilarating.</p><p>Before this, he had been suppressed. To be honest, he was very aggrieved. But now, he had completely released all that aggrievement. He felt extremely happy.</p><p>These people were crushed by him. One by one, they died in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the Scarlet Flame clan who was fighting with Bing Qing knew that things were not going well when he saw this. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. No one present could defeat him. If this continued, they would all die.</p><p>The people from the Scarlet Flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land all gathered together and ran for their lives.</p><p>However, Lu Ming obviously did not want to let them off so easily. He chased after them with a gun in his hand. He killed many people along the way, leaving behind a trail of corpses.</p><p>In the end, the Scarlet Flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, and the other sects all left behind white corpses.</p><p>There were about a hundred and fifty people on the other side, but only fifty were left. They were running for their lives. Lu Ming finally stopped his pursuit.</p><p>Behind him, bingqing and the others caught up.</p><p>They were in a terrible situation.</p><p>Now, there were only about 30 people left from the ice Soul Clan and the other sects. The others were all dead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
