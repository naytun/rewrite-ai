However, he did not show any fear. Instead, he sneered.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and asked with a frown.</p><p>“So it’s the law enforcement Army. This person offended me and was beheaded by me. You can collect his body!”</p><p>Huang Ke put her hands behind her back and glanced at Lu Ming casually.</p><p>“You killed him? This person was running a shop in the holy city and was under the protection of the law enforcement Army. Why did you kill him? Come with us to the law enforcement Hall and give us a good explanation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What did you just say? You want to take me to the law enforcement Hall?”</p><p>Huang Ke almost burst out laughing as if she had heard a very funny joke. She looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>On the side, the others were in a similar situation.</p><p>The law enforcement Hall dared to arrest Huang Ke? The Huang family was a big force in the sacred city. Now the law enforcement Army was useless. Did they really dare to take Huang Ke down?</p><p>“Nonsense. Tie Xing, take him down!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Tie Xing was the name of the black Gorilla Man.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The black Gorilla Man revealed a difficult expression.</p><p>“Commander, it’s not good to offend this Huang Ke!”</p><p>Tie Xing whispered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>“Hmph, if you guys don’t do it, I’ll do it myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he stepped forward.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Huang Ke shouted.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>a mere law enforcement soldier. He’s looking for death. Kill him!</p><p>With a wave of Huang Ke’s hand, the burly man behind him stepped forward. A violent aura burst forth, the aura of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The burly man bellowed with cold killing intent. He unsheathed his saber and slashed at Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and slapped.</p><p>The space rumbled and the terrifying power broke through all of the burly man’s defenses. A palm hit the burly man’s chest, directly blasting a big hole in it. He let out a miserable scream and died with an incredulous expression.</p><p>Even until his death, he still could not believe that the law enforcement Army’s trash had actually become so overbearing.</p><p>“You … You dare to …”</p><p>Huang Ke was so frightened that her face turned pale. She shivered and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>if you want to kill me, you have to be killed by me. You asked him to kill me, so I’ll cripple you first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“No, don’t …” Huang Ke was extremely frightened.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his fingers and a spear ray shot out, crippling Huang Ke’s cultivation.</p><p>“Ah, you’ve destroyed my cultivation. I want you to die a horrible death!”</p><p>Huang Ke let out a shrill scream.</p><p>On the side, the others were extremely shocked. This law enforcement Army was completely different from the past. They were actually so ruthless and decisive.</p><p>However, there were also many people secretly clapping their hands. Huang Ke had finally gotten his retribution for all the evil he had done by relying on his family’s power.</p><p>However, this law enforcement Army was going to be in trouble soon, and the Huang family would not let this go.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, tie Xing and the rest widened their eyes. They were at a loss.</p><p>Although doing this made them feel very good and comfortable, now they were comfortable, but what would the consequences be?</p><p>After crippling Huang Ke, the Huang family would probably go crazy.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Huang Ke’s and the burly man’s storage rings over and handed them to the two women.</p><p>The old man and the young man were obviously the shopkeeper’s family members. The two of them cried bitterly and looked helpless.</p><p>take these two storage rings and leave the holy city. Go live elsewhere!</p><p>Lu Ming said as he handed the storage ring to the two of them.</p><p>“Thank you, my Lord!”</p><p>The two of them thanked him repeatedly and quickly left the city.</p><p>“Tie Xing, bring this piece of trash back to the law enforcement Hall!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed, then turned around and headed to the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>Tie Xing and the others looked at each other. In the end, they gritted their teeth, picked up Huang Ke, and rushed back to the law enforcement Hall. On the way, Huang Ke cried and cried, attracting the attention of many people.</p><p>“There’s going to be a good show. The Huang clan will definitely fly into a rage and kill their way to the law enforcement Hall!”</p><p>“They probably won’t attack the law enforcement Army directly, but they’ll put pressure on the higher-ups of the law enforcement Army before attacking the law enforcement Hall. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Along the way, a large group of people followed behind Lu Ming and the rest as they headed to the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest returned to the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>When the remaining law enforcement soldiers in the law enforcement Hall saw this Scene and Heard what had happened, all of them were so scared that their faces turned pale. They were finished this time. How were they going to deal with the other party’s experts when they came to kill them?</p><p>“Forget it, I can’t hide, I’ll go all out!”</p><p>“But I’m still f * cking happy!”</p><p>“That’s true, haha!”</p><p>The other members of the law enforcement Hall were discussing in hushed voices. Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He crossed his arms and closed his eyes to rest, waiting quietly.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sky around the law enforcement Hall was filled with people. Some were waiting quietly, while others were gloating.</p><p>Time slowly passed. Two hours later.</p><p>“The Huang family is here!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at the sky.</p><p>A total of three people stepped through the air.</p><p>The two old men’s clothes were very similar to Huang Ke’s, so they should be experts of the Huang family. There was also a middle-aged man who was actually wearing the uniform of the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“It’s the Lord Commander!”</p><p>Tie Xing’s expression changed as he whispered into Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>His so-called Lord Commander was the commander of the law enforcement Army, commanding all the existing law enforcement troops in the holy city.</p><p>The law enforcement Army’s commander’s face was as black as a pot. He looked at Lu Ming and chided, ” “Minglu, why don’t you release young master Huang Ke?”</p><p>The law enforcement Army’s commander was in a bad mood. He was extremely upset, especially when he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>How could Lu Ming not know the current situation of the law enforcement Army? Not only did he not apologize to the other party, but he also killed the Huang family’s guards and crippled Huang Ke’s cultivation. It would be strange if the Huang family didn’t fly into a rage.</p><p>The other party’s spirit God powerhouse had come to him directly to put pressure on him.</p><p>“Release him? Hehe, commander, this man killed a shopkeeper on the street. The shopkeeper had to be protected by the ancient Saint dynasty if he was doing business in the Saint City. Otherwise, who would dare to do business in the Saint City in the future? I’m doing this impartially, why should I let him go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>The other people from the law enforcement Hall behind him were secretly worried for Lu Ming. The commander of the law enforcement Army was a spiritual God powerhouse. Lu Ming actually dared to speak to a spiritual God powerhouse in this manner?</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming’s words made the commander of the law enforcement Hall’s face turn even gloomier. However, he could not find any words to refute.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming was doing the right thing. Lu Ming was carrying out the duties of the law enforcement Hall. As the commander of the law enforcement Army, how could he refute that?</p><p>hehe, commander Chen, it seems like your subordinate doesn’t listen to you at all. In that case, let me do it myself. I’ll cripple this person’s cultivation and bring him back to the Huang family to deal with him!</p><p>An old man from the Huang family said indifferently. A killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
