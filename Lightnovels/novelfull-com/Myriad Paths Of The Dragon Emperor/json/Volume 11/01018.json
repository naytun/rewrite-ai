Half of the sky was filled with lightning while the other half was filled with blood Qi.</p><p>...</p><p>The lightning and the blood-red light kept clashing and clashing. No one could see Yin BUPO and Xue Luo Zi’s figures at all. They could only see light and shadow intertwining.</p><p>This battle lasted for two hours. The lightning and blood light in the sky dissipated at the same time. Two figures stood on one side of the sky, gasping for breath. Their eyes were sharp and serious as they stared at each other.</p><p>It was a draw!</p><p>It was said that in the battle of Providence, the two of them exchanged thousands of moves and ended up in a draw. Today, it was the same.</p><p>blood Luo Zi, I didn’t expect you to have some skills. You’re lucky today!</p><p>Yin BUPO said coldly.</p><p>“I should be the one saying that. I’ll spare your life today!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi also sneered.</p><p>The two of them didn’t continue to fight. They had exchanged a thousand moves just now, and the two of them had used up a lot of their energy. Moreover, there were many experts around them, so they had to leave some strength to guard against someone who might attack them in the dark.</p><p>it seems like they won’t fight again this time. It’s a draw again. Xue Luo Zi and Yin BUPO are really strong opponents!</p><p>that’s true. Sky Eagle Castle and cold-blood Hall are close to each other. The two forces have been fighting each other for a long time. Yin BUPO and master blood Luo have been fighting since they were young, but there has never been a winner between them. But this is a good thing. With a lifelong opponent, their progress is amazing!</p><p>it’s good to have an opponent. This is a golden era with countless geniuses. In the past, geniuses like Yin BUPO and master blood Luo would definitely be invincible. But today, there are more than 20 of them, and there are even the stronger top five young warriors!</p><p>Many people in the surroundings couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>There were too many heaven’s favorites in this generation. Second-grade heaven’s favorites like Yin BUPO and Xue Luo Zi had the chance to break through to the martial Royal realm. In the past, it was considered good if there were two or three of them in each generation.</p><p>But in this generation, there were over 20 of them, and even the more powerful five overlords. Even the eastern barren territory, Southern nether, Northern Plains, and Western Desert were filled with talents. Heaven’s pride experts were like clouds, and all of them were competing with each other. This was a brilliant Golden Age.</p><p>Everyone knew that this battle was over, and some people were preparing to leave.</p><p>“Everyone, Tan Xiang is preparing to host the alchemy King’s banquet in seven days. I’d like to invite all of you to have a drink and discuss Dao. Would you all be willing to give this little girl some face?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and melodious voice sounded. It was fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Haha, it’s a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity for goddess Tan Xiang to personally host the pill King banquet. How can I not go?”</p><p>Demon mountain Jun Yue was the first to speak, his eyes shining.</p><p>“Many thanks, brother Jun!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang bowed slightly.</p><p>“It’s our honor to be able to attend the pill King banquet organized by goddess Tan Xiang!”</p><p>“As long as fairy doesn’t mind, I’ll definitely pay you a visit!”</p><p>The others all rushed to speak, hoping to attract goddess Tan Xiang’s attention.</p><p>“Then this little sister thanks everyone, this little sister will take her leave first. Everyone can stay in the pill city for the time being, and head to the pill King Academy in seven days!”</p><p>With that said, fairy Tan Xiang bowed slightly, then stepped on the air and left.</p><p>After that, Jing kongling also turned around and left, like a fairy in the clouds.</p><p>“Yin BUPO, we’ll fight another day!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi turned into a ray of blood light and left.</p><p>Yin BUPO laughed coldly and also left. After that, the others also dispersed.</p><p>“Brother Chu, what is the pill King banquet?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Chu Kuang.</p><p>the people of the valley of the medicine Masters are all alchemists who mainly refine pills. The pills of the valley of the medicine Masters are well-known all over the world, and some of the outstanding Heroes of the Valley of the medicine Masters will, from time to time, melt their proudest pills into fine wine and invite the world’s heroes to come and have a taste, and also make friends with the world’s heroes. So, although the valley of the medicine Masters is not an Overlord force today, its influence is still extremely terrifying!</p><p>Chu Kuang explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This tradition was very special.</p><p>“Let’s go to the pill city first. The pill King institution is in the pill city!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said. Immediately, the three of them flew towards the city of pills. On the way, Lu Ming learned more about the valley of the medicine Masters.</p><p>The valley of the medicine Masters had been an Overlord force in the distant past, but now, because they did not have an Emperor to hold down the Fort, they had stepped down from the throne of Overlord force. However, their strength was still very terrifying and could not be underestimated.</p><p>There was more than one Supreme martial artist in the valley of the medicine Masters, and they were good at alchemy and had good relations with the major forces. Their potential was no small matter.</p><p>The city of alchemy was built in the vicinity of the valley of the medicine Masters. It was very crowded and lively here. The valley of the medicine Masters sold all kinds of elixirs here and also bought all kinds of spiritual herbs and flowers, so it attracted a large number of Chambers of Commerce to sell and purchase elixirs.</p><p>The pill city was not far from the pillar of heavens mountains. In just half a day, the three arrived at the pill city.</p><p>“So many spirit herbs, so many spirit herbs!”</p><p>Dandan had appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder again, her eyes darting around.</p><p>On both sides of the city’s streets, there were spirit herb shops. The rich medicinal fragrance of the elixir shops came from all directions, which made people feel refreshed.</p><p>No wonder dandan was looking around.</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin glanced at dandan. They thought that this little turtle was quite interesting.</p><p>“Brother Chu, miss Wenjing, how about we find a place to stay?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to find a place to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin nodded and the three of them found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>In the room of the inn, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his figure disappeared. Only the mountain and river diagram was left floating in the room.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on a mountain peak. With a wave of his hand, a large pile of raw gemstones appeared around him.</p><p>“I’ll break through to the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm with the orirocks!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The spiritual God expert from cold-blood Hall had made Lu Ming realize the huge gap between him and a spiritual God expert. This time, he was under a lot of pressure when he saw the battle between Xue Luo Zi and Yin BUPO.</p><p>Now, he had many restrictions and his cultivation was not high enough. If he were to fight against heaven’s favorites like blood Luo Zi and Yin BUPO, he would most likely not be their match. Hence, he needed to increase his strength urgently.</p><p>Originally, he did not plan to use the raw gemstones to improve his cultivation because the consumption of raw gemstones would definitely be terrifying. He did not have many raw gemstones on him now. He had wanted to keep them as a backup, but he could not care so much now. Improving his strength was the most important thing.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged and swallowed. A terrifying devouring power burst out, shattering tens of thousands of raw gemstones. The majestic original Qi was devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons and began to be refined rapidly.</p><p>Circulating the true war Dragon technique, the origin Qi was constantly refined and transformed into true essence. The true essence gathered in the spirit embryo and was constantly condensed. The spirit embryo became more and more solid, and its size became smaller and smaller.</p><p>After refining tens of thousands of raw gemstones, another tens of thousands of gemstones were refined.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>In three days, Lu Ming had refined more than three hundred thousand raw gemstones.</p><p>“Soon!”</p><p>With a sharp glint in his eyes, he continued to refine. Another day passed and he had refined nearly 100000 raw gemstones.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Something seemed to have been broken through. Lu Ming’s aura grew and the essential core in his body roared. It was several times more powerful than before.</p><p>His cultivation broke through and reached the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
