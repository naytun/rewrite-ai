He then entered the mountain and river diagram and sat cross-legged on a mountain peak. He began to refine the blood essence energy and runes that he had devoured.</p><p>...</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had devoured more than a hundred experts above the spirit embryo realm. Among them, there was no lack of eighth or ninth level spirit embryo realm and even perfected spirit embryo realm. Furthermore, many of them cultivated the concept of water.</p><p>So many concept runes were continuously refined and integrated into Lu Ming’s own water concept runes. His water concept was rapidly improving.</p><p>In just a few hours, Lu Ming’s water concept had broken through to level three upper tier and continued to improve.</p><p>The early stage of the third level, the middle stage, and the late stage.</p><p>When all the concept runes were refined, Lu Ming’s water concept rose to the late-stage of level three.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s concept of water advanced to the later stage of the third level, the spirit embryo in his dantian finally erupted with a powerful suction force. The energy that had been devoured seemed to have found an outlet and was frantically converted into essential core, increasing Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation, which had stagnated for more than half a year, began to improve rapidly.</p><p>The early stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm, the middle stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm …</p><p>When everyone’s energy was refined, Lu Ming’s cultivation rose to the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>However, his bloodline had not been upgraded. All the blood essence he had used to upgrade his nine Dragon bloodline was obviously not enough.</p><p>After refining all the energy, Lu Ming opened his eyes and a Lotus platform appeared in his hand.</p><p>The Lotus platform had 81 petals, and each petal was filled with a strong water concept and water spiritual Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the pristine water lotus throne to continue improving his water concept.</p><p>He first plucked three petals and swallowed them.</p><p>The refined flower petal melted in his mouth and a cool feeling flowed down his throat. It turned into a cool energy that filled Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if he was surrounded by endless water vapor. He could clearly sense the concept of water. Lu Ming closed his eyes and continued to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>When the energy of the three flower petals disappeared, Lu Ming plucked another three flower petals and swallowed them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s water concept began to improve rapidly again.</p><p>After refining 27 flower petals, his water concept had broken through to the full stage of level three and was on par with the wind, fire, and Thunder concepts. It was even slightly higher than the earth concept.</p><p>His earth will was only at the peak of Level 3 upper tier. It was still a step away from the full circle of Level 3.</p><p>This was not the end. Lu Ming continued to refine the remaining flower petals.</p><p>He was trying to break through to the fourth level of the water concept.</p><p>The cleansing Water lotus throne was extremely useful for third level intent realm and the advancement of third level intent realm to fourth level intent realm. It wasn’t just for show. It was indeed miraculous.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s current level of comprehension was terrifying. Therefore, when all the petals were refined, Lu Ming actually broke through the bottleneck in one go and his water concept broke through to the fourth level.</p><p>The water concept was the concept that Lu Ming had comprehended the latest. He did not expect that he would be the first to break through to level four.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes, looking delighted.</p><p>To be able to break through to level four was also beyond his expectations.</p><p>He didn’t have much hope of successfully breaking through. After all, the fourth level intent realm was the last intent realm. It was extremely difficult to break through.</p><p>Many of the older generation were stuck at this step, unable to break through for their entire lives.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that he would break through this time.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that this had a lot to do with his immense luck and the ten-fold increase in his comprehension.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to break through to level four so easily, even with a treasure like the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>Of course, the stage of the spiritual God Realm was not as simple as just the concept. Some people could not break through to the spiritual God Realm even after their concept had broken through to the fourth level. Of course, Lu Ming was still a distance away from breaking through to the spiritual God Realm. There was no need to consider it for the time being.</p><p>ten days have passed. It’s time for me to leave. I’ll travel and cultivate while heading to the ancient Saint dynasty!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>This was his current plan.</p><p>At the moment, his cultivation was still weak. Even if he reached the ancient Saint dynasty, he would not have the ability to take Xie nianqing away. He planned to travel around while taking risks to cultivate and improve his strength.</p><p>After exiting the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming soared into the sky and headed west.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was not very fast. However, one day later, he had covered a distance of millions of miles.</p><p>A large city appeared in front of them.</p><p>On the city gate, there were three big words-sunset Moon City.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was such a coincidence. Chu Kuang had said that if Lu Ming ended his closed-door cultivation ten days later, he could come to the waning moon residence in the sunset Moon City to have a drink with Chu Kuang.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming did not take it to heart. He did not expect that he would still come to the sunset Moon City.</p><p>since you’re here, let’s go to the Xiaoyue house. Chu Kuang said that there will be a grand event soon. What is it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the sunset Moon City.</p><p>Sunset Moon City was huge, twice the size of Lishui City, and the Howling Moon House was very famous in the city.</p><p>This was because the Xiaoyue house was the biggest restaurant in the sunset Moon City.</p><p>After asking around, Lu Ming found out where the Xiaoyue house was. After turning a few streets, a five-story restaurant appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Guest, do you want to drink? Even in the entire floating mountain range, the wine of our shop is among the best!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just entered the restaurant when a waiter came up to him.</p><p>“I’m here to find someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, who are you looking for? This little one will have some impression of anyone who comes into this shop to drink!” The waiter replied.</p><p>“Chu Kuang!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So you’re the guest that young master Chu Kuang was waiting for. Young master Chu Kuang is in the private room on the fifth floor. He has been drinking here for three days. He said that a friend will come to look for him in the next few days. I think it must be you, young master. Please follow me!”</p><p>The waiter said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not expect Chu Kuang to really be waiting for him here. He had even waited for three days.</p><p>It seemed that Chu Kuang was right to say that he liked to make friends.</p><p>He followed the waiter to a private room on the fifth floor. Before the waiter could announce his arrival, a loud laugh came from the private room.”Hahaha, I could feel your presence the moment brother Lu arrived.”</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>The door of the private room opened and Chu Kuang walked out with a smile on his face.</p><p>The waiter also left.</p><p>“Brother Chu, were you waiting for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right. Since I said I wanted to be friends with you, I naturally had to wait for you here. However, I was going to wait for one more day at most. If you didn’t come by then, I would have to leave. Fortunately, you came. It seems that brother Lu still acknowledges me, haha!”</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed heartily.</p><p>Lu Ming felt ashamed in his heart. He did not plan to come at first. He just happened to pass by sunset Moon City and decided to come and take a look.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please, the wine is ready!”</p><p>Chu Kuang waved his hand and Lu Ming and Chu Kuang entered the private room one after another.</p><p>In the corner of the private room, there were already a few empty jars. It was obvious that Chu Kuang had drunk a lot of wine these few days.</p><p>haha, brother Lu, you must be joking. I’m a person who loves wine as much as my life. I have to come to this moonhowl Tavern’s wine every once in a while!</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed.</p><p>On the table, there were already two jars of wine.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
