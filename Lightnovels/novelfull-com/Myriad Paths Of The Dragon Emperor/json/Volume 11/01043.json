He circulated the prison-suppressing heaven technique to its maximum and threw a punch.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the two fists met, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took a few steps back. The qi and blood in his body were in turmoil. He felt something sweet in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This old man was too strong. He was at the second level of the spiritual God Realm, which was several times stronger than the first level.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art to its maximum and barely managed to block the punch. However, he was still injured.</p><p>When the elder saw that Lu Ming, an ant with a great circle of the spirit embryo realm, could actually block his punch and not die, he was shocked. He was a little dazed and did not continue to attack for a moment.</p><p>At the same time, the essential core in the dimensional stone was flowing into Lu Ming’s body. He pulled Zhou Xin along and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to sprint forward.</p><p>Zhou Xin had given him the purple jade that contained the Nanyuan stones back then. Now that they were in danger, how could Lu Ming leave her in the lurch?</p><p>The two of them left in a flash. Only then did the old man react. His killing intent exploded as he angrily shouted,”Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>It chased after Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of them, cold-blood Hall experts were also charging toward Lu Ming. Their attacks enveloped the two of them.</p><p>This was the attack of an expert at the perfected spirit embryo realm. Lu Ming was unafraid of it alone. However, he had Zhou Xin with him. Lu Ming wanted to launch an attack to help Zhou Xin block the attack. In that case, his speed would be slowed down.</p><p>Behind him, the old man was chasing after him at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Hand over your storage rings and I’ll let you go!”</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>Zhou Xin gritted her teeth and didn’t say a word. Her face was filled with anxiety and worry, but she didn’t seem to have any intention of handing over her storage ring.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll risk it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and a voice entered Zhou Xin’s ears.</p><p>“Don’t resist!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out and Zhou Xin nodded. Then, a light flashed between Lu Ming’s brows and the mountain and river diagram appeared. He rolled Zhou Xin up and kept her into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one left. His speed increased sharply, and the cold-blood Hall expert with a perfect spirit embryo burst into pieces as Lu Ming rushed past him.</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and moved like a stream of light. For a moment, the elder could not catch up with him.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Who is this young man?”</p><p>The old man was shocked. He tried his best to chase after Lu Ming, but he realized that Lu Ming was getting further and further away.</p><p>In less than two minutes, Lu Ming rushed into the mountain range at the side.</p><p>There were terrifying ferocious beasts entrenched in the mountain range. Not long after Lu Ming charged in, he encountered several ferocious beasts of the spirit embryo realm, all of which he rushed past.</p><p>Behind him, the cold-blood Hall elder was still in hot pursuit. Lu Ming could only run as fast as he could.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A huge black Tiger appeared. It was more than ten meters tall, like a small mountain, and a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>With a loud roar, the clouds in the sky exploded.</p><p>This was an extremely powerful vicious beast that had the bloodline of a divine beast. However, it was unwilling to transform into a human form and was hiding in the deep mountains and old forests.</p><p>When he saw Lu Ming and the cold-blood Hall elder, his eyes glowed with ferocity. He roared and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with the mountain and river diagram and threw a punch. However, he was still sent flying by the black Tiger’s palm and broke dozens of boulders.</p><p>However, the black Tiger’s target was clearly not Lu Ming but the old man.</p><p>As the old man posed a strong threat to the black Tiger and Lu Ming’s aura was weak, the black Tiger could not be bothered with him after the slap and pounced on the old man.</p><p>Suddenly, the black Tiger and the old man began to fight, and the old man was suppressed.</p><p>Not far away, a rock exploded and Lu Ming rushed out of it. In a flash, he left the place and went far away at top speed.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall elder bellowed, but he was helpless. Suppressed by the black Tiger, he could only barely protect himself as he watched Lu Ming leave.</p><p>“This Black Tiger is really powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He felt an excruciating pain all over his body.</p><p>He had been slapped by the black Tiger and suffered a serious injury.</p><p>However, it was worth it to shake off the cold-blood Hall elder.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming slowed down a little and restrained his aura. He focused his mind and sensed carefully. If he sensed a powerful aura, Lu Ming would go around it.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a full day to cross the mountain range.</p><p>After crossing the mountain range, Lu Ming did not stop. He rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>After flying for a few million miles, Lu Ming stopped by a small river. He took a bath in the river and changed his clothes. Then, he sat cross-legged and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>Although he was injured, they were all physical injuries. Now that his physical body was strong, these injuries were healed in less than half a day.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He waved his hand and Zhou Xin appeared.</p><p>The moment Zhou Xin appeared, she scanned her surroundings vigilantly. When she saw that Lu Ming was alone, she heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>don’t worry, miss Zhou. We’re already far away from that mountain range!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I, Zhou Xin, would like to thank young master Lu for saving me once again. I am extremely grateful!</p><p>Zhou Xin bowed to Lu Ming and expressed her gratitude.</p><p>you’re welcome, miss Zhou. Back then, you gave me the purple jade that you had your eyes on. Since I saw you in danger, it’s only right that I help you!</p><p>“Where are your servants?” Lu Ming smiled and asked.</p><p>Back then, Zhou Xin had servants and guards by her side. Now, not a single one of them could be seen.</p><p>Zhou Xin’s eyes were red as she said,”they …” They’re all dead?”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not say much. He pondered for a moment and said,”Miss Zhou, where do you live? Do you need me to send you back?”</p><p>“I’m from the Zhou family of yangu mountain. I was just about to invite you to my Zhou family as a guest.”</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>“Along the Gushan?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment.</p><p>Previously, he had bought a map of the central continent and had a rough idea of the direction along the Gushan. It was also to the West and it would not go in the opposite direction of the direction Lu Ming wanted to go.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Zhou Xin was overjoyed. The two of them rose into the air and left the place.</p><p>After a few million miles, they arrived at a small faction with a teleportation formation.</p><p>On this side of the mountain, cold-blood Hall did not have the power to control other people’s teleportation formations, because this side already belonged to the sky Eagle Fort.</p><p>The two of them took the teleportation formation and crossed a distance of hundreds of millions of miles, which was equivalent to the distance of dozens of big regions in the East barren. Then, they flew for another two days before they arrived at yangu mountain.</p><p>There were not many plants on the mountain because it was filled with fire-type spiritual Qi. The plants here were all of the fire-type and were very few in number.</p><p>Yangu mountain was the Zhou clan’s territory.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming learned that the Zhou family was not a big force. There were not many spiritual God Realm experts in the Zhou family, and they could be counted on one hand.</p><p>“Miss is back!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the vicinity of yangu mountain, someone cheered.</p><p>“So you’re the young miss of the Zhou family!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>my father is the head of the Zhou family. He’s just a small force. Young master Lu, please don’t laugh at me!</p><p>Zhou Xin pursed her lips and smiled.</p><p>“Xiner!”</p><p>A moment later, a middle-aged man came out to greet him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
