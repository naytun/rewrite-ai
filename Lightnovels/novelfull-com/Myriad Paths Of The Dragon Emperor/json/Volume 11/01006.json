In an instant, it had arrived in front of Ling yunkong.</p><p>Even though Ling yunkong was prepared for this, he was still shocked. In a hurry, he made his move.</p><p>However, his attack and defense were as fragile as tofu in front of Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm pierced through all defenses and grabbed Ling yunkong’s throat. With a burst of energy, Ling yunkong’s neck seemed to be about to break. He let out a blood-curdling screech and his essential core almost dissipated.</p><p>The surrounding people were all stunned.</p><p>It was unbelievable that Lu Ming could restrain Ling yunkong with one move.</p><p>After a long time, everyone finally reacted.</p><p>“How dare you! Let go of young master yunkong!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death, you know?”</p><p>A few old men shouted. They were all Ling yunkong’s trusted aides.</p><p>shut up! I’ll break his neck right now!</p><p>There was a murderous glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. Killing intent burst forth.</p><p>The few elders immediately shut up.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, I’m the heaven’s pride expert of the floating mountain martial school. If you kill me, the experts of the floating mountain martial school will not let you off!</p><p>Ling yunkong roared.</p><p>“You have lost so miserably in a fight between peers. Do you really think that those higher-ups of the floating mountain martial school will stand up for you? are you not afraid of being ridiculed by the world?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his eyes cold.</p><p>Ling yunkong shivered as a trace of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p>That was indeed the case. In a fight between peers, if one was killed because he was no match for the other, the elders of the sect would take revenge. Did the other party not have any elders?</p><p>By then, the other party’s elders would also kill the heaven’s pride experts of their own younger generation. Then, how would the young heaven’s pride experts in the world have the chance to rise again? wouldn’t they all be dead?</p><p>Whether it was the East continent, the central continent, or other places, this was an unwritten rule. When the younger generation fought, under normal circumstances, the older generation would not interfere.</p><p>Of course, special circumstances were an exception.</p><p>“If I wanted to kill you, it would be a piece of cake. Do you understand the difference between you and me now?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and continued, ” however, even if I don’t kill you today, I can agree to fight him. However, my condition is still the same as before. Swear it, a blood oath. If you lose, you can’t touch the Xiao family in any way. On the other hand, I will fulfill my condition.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at hai Ziming.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had to completely solve the Xiao family’s future trouble. Otherwise, there would be no end to this.</p><p>On one hand, he wanted to force Ling yunkong to make a blood oath. On the other hand, he wanted to display his powerful abilities to intimidate them.</p><p>“I promise you, if I lose, I won’t touch the Xiao family at all, and I won’t let anyone touch them!”</p><p>Hai Ziming was the first to speak.</p><p>In the end, Ling yunkong had no choice. His life was in Lu Ming’s hands. He could only agree and take a blood oath.</p><p>Once a martial artist made a blood oath, he could not go against it. Otherwise, in the future, he would be plagued by inner demons. Not only would it be difficult to advance his cultivation, but he might even suffer from Qi deviation.</p><p>After Ling yunkong had made the blood oath, Lu Ming flung him away.</p><p>“Damn it, I hope hai Ziming can kill this Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes flickered with cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to treat him in this way. This made his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>Moreover, he had lost all his face today. His only hope now was that hai Ziming could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>He was still quite confident in hai Ziming.</p><p>He felt that the reason why he was caught by Lu Ming was because Lu Ming had caught him off guard. If he had been on guard, Lu Ming would not have been able to take him down so easily.</p><p>He was not the only one who thought so. In fact, many people thought so too. It was because Lu Ming had indeed succeeded in his sneak attack.</p><p>Moreover, Ling yunkong was very clear about hai Ziming’s combat strength.</p><p>Among all the heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain sect, hai Ziming was the one who caught up from behind. He rose quickly and his improvement speed was shocking.</p><p>In the battle of Providence, hai Ziming was ranked fifth among the top ten geniuses of the floating mountain sect. However, half a year had passed, and Ling yunkong was clear that even the fourth-ranked genius of the floating mountain sect might not be a match for hai Ziming.</p><p>Therefore, he had confidence in hai Ziming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Hai Ziming stepped forward and stood opposite Lu Ming. A powerful aura erupted from him without any restraint. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight and excitement.</p><p>The peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Hai Ziming did not hide it at all. Lu Ming could tell at a glance that hai Ziming’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, allow me to experience it!”</p><p>Hai Ziming’s palm glowed, and an ocean blue spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Hai Ziming also used a gun.</p><p>His long spear seemed to be made of blue gemstones, and water vapor emanated from it from time to time. Under the sunlight, it emitted a colorful radiance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers moved slightly and the infinite Dragon Spear appeared.</p><p>“Good spear!” Hai Ziming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Yours is not bad either!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then let’s fight!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, hai Ziming took another step forward and waved his long spear. In the air, shadows of Spears appeared all over the sky, heading straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>Radiance filled the air and there were countless spear shadows. It seemed to have covered all of Lu Ming’s paths.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and similarly, he thrust out a sky full of spear shadows, which constantly collided with hai Ziming’s spear shadows.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The dense sounds of collision were like raindrops falling to the ground, endless.</p><p>The spear shadows that filled the sky completely drowned Lu Ming and hai Ziming. Outsiders could only see the spear shadows but not the person.</p><p>It rang for at least a few thousand times before the sound stopped. The spear shadows that filled the sky disappeared and two figures appeared.</p><p>“Vast waves spear art!”</p><p>The long spear in hai Ziming’s hands spun and waved. It was as if there were several large rivers spinning around the long spear. It carried a terrifying power and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>spear concept, there’s another concept that’s also extremely terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Hai Zi’s talent was shocking. She had actually comprehended two powerful intents and had already fused them into one. Her combat strength was extremely strong.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear glowed with a five-colored radiance. At the same time, it activated the strangle hell heaven art. Every spear strike contained a terrifying power that could suppress everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two long Spears collided with each other. In the end, the river collapsed and hai Ziming’s long spear was sent flying.</p><p>Hai Ziming’s body retreated quickly, and he only stopped after retreating a hundred meters. His expression was serious.</p><p>On the other hand, Ling yunkong’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually so powerful. The combat strength that he was displaying now had already surpassed his combat strength when he had fought with him previously.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had been hiding his strength.</p><p>amazing! Take my strongest move!</p><p>Hai Zi’s eyes lit up as a long spear appeared above her head. The spear was also surrounded by a large river and six golden chakras floated above it.</p><p>A divine level rank 6 bloodline!</p><p>Hai Ziming used his bloodline fusion and transformed into a spear.</p><p>“The boundless sea!”</p><p>Hai Ziming’s voice came from the long spear.</p><p>The long spear vibrated and spun in the air as it stabbed out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have seen an ocean. The waves were shocking, and with a power that could destroy everything, it surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ocean concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew what hai Ziming’s other concept was. It was the ocean concept, a terrifying concept.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
