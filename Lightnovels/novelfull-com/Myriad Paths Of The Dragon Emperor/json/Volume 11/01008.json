It was time for him to leave.</p><p>big brother Lu, will you come to see us again in the future? ”</p><p>A-Qing looked at Lu Ming, reluctant to leave.</p><p>Ah Lei didn’t say anything, but her eyes were the same, reluctant to leave.</p><p>I will. When I have time, I will come and visit you. You must cultivate well. If anything happens, just pass a message to me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded at Xiao Zhan. Then, he rose into the air and left, flying in the direction of the black water lake.</p><p>The black water lake was located a few million miles west of the city.</p><p>The black water lake was not big. It was only about a hundred miles in radius. When Lu Ming arrived, the black water lake was already surrounded by people. These people were not only from Lishui City but from all over the world.</p><p>There were men and women, young and old. Many of them had powerful auras and profound cultivation.</p><p>“That’s Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s arrival caused a commotion. Some people recognized him.</p><p>Many people looked at him with solemness and wariness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely terrifying. Even hai Ziming was not his match. It could be said that there were few who could match him in the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>This was a strong competitor.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored everyone’s gazes and looked at the black water lake.</p><p>As its name suggested, the black water of the black water lake was black in color. It was said that the water was highly toxic, and even a spirit embryo realm expert would be in grave danger if they were to come into contact with it.</p><p>In the middle of the black water lake, there was a Green Lotus platform. At this moment, it was emitting a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>This was the pure water lotus throne. However, it was obvious that the pure water lotus throne was not fully mature.</p><p>The cleansing Water lotus throne was a special spiritual medicine. If it was not fully mature, it would not be a spiritual medicine, but a poison.</p><p>Only when it was fully mature would it be a spiritual medicine, which was of great help to the cultivation of water attribute techniques and the concept of water.</p><p>so many experts have come. It seems like we have no chance!</p><p>look, that’s Lu Shaoqing. He’s the heaven’s favorite who defeated hai Ziming. His combat strength is extremely terrifying!</p><p>“There are also quite a few people at the peak of the Sea of Souls realm!”</p><p>an ordinary perfected spiritual ocean tier cultivator is nothing. There are a few experts at the level of old monsters!</p><p>Around them, many people were discussing in low voices. Some people sighed, knowing that they had no hope.</p><p>The so-called ‘old monster level’ expert was a term used to address some extremely terrifying existences in the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Among those in the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, there were a few people who had awakened a divine bloodline but were stuck at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm and did not break through to the spiritual God Realm. Those who had lived for a long time and were terrifying in all aspects were called old monsters.</p><p>These people were different from ordinary great circle spirit embryos. When they were young, they were all god tier heaven’s favorites.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to break through to the spirit God Realm. Many prodigies with first or second rank divine bloodlines would be stuck at the limits of the spirit embryo realm and would not be able to break through for the rest of their lives. These people were the most terrifying ones among the spirit embryo realm. Their combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>There were a few of such people present today.</p><p>Moreover, the number of people was still increasing.</p><p>“That’s yang Cong, one of the ten heaven’s favorites from the floating mountain sect!”</p><p>“There’s also Wu Kong, one of the top ten heaven’s favorites.”</p><p>Someone exclaimed as they looked at the sky.</p><p>From the East and West, there was a young man each walking through the air. His aura was dignified and extraordinary.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>During this period of time, he had gained some understanding of the top ten heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain sect.</p><p>Yang Cong was ranked fourth, while Wu Kong was ranked sixth. Both of them were extremely powerful heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the pristine water lotus throne had attracted all the heaven’s favorites from the floating mountain sect.</p><p>The eyes of many old monsters turned serious.</p><p>Although the cultivation of heaven’s favorites like Yang Cong and Wu Kong were not as high as them, their combat strength could not be judged by common sense.</p><p>Everyone waited quietly, and more and more people arrived.</p><p>Half a day later, the cleansing Water lotus throne suddenly shone brightly. The strong medicinal fragrance could be smelled even from hundreds of miles away.</p><p>“The cleansing Water lotus throne has matured!”</p><p>Countless people’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In an instant, at least a few hundred people charged towards the black water lake.</p><p>“Get lost, the cleansing Water lotus throne is mine!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death, it’s mine!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Roars of anger rang out, and all sorts of lights burst out. Screams of pain rang out continuously, and blood dyed the black water lake red.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The energy surged and the water of the black water lake churned and splashed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Shrill screams were heard. Some people were splashed by the water of the black water lake. They actually made sizzling sounds and their bodies were quickly corroded.</p><p>not good! Be careful! This lake water is poisonous!</p><p>Many people shouted in shock and circulated their true Yuan to protect themselves.</p><p>However, the lake water was extremely poisonous. When it touched one’s Zhen Yuan, even the Zhen Yuan would be quickly corroded.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Roars of anger could be heard continuously. Some people were struck into the lake and were submerged by the water. Their protective Zhen Yuan was quickly corroded. In the end, they let out miserable screams and died without a corpse.</p><p>Many people were shocked and began to retreat, not daring to charge forward.</p><p>It was too dangerous. In just a short while, over a hundred people had died, and they were all strong practitioners of the spirit embryo realm and above.</p><p>Those martial artists below the spirit embryo realm didn’t dare to charge forward at all. As long as they were splashed by a drop of the lake water, they would be dead.</p><p>However, there were still many people who charged forward. They were all experts, and with a glance, one could see that they were all experts at the sixth level spirit embryo realm or above.</p><p>Suddenly, the water in the lake churned, and a few huge creatures appeared from the black water lake.</p><p>They were huge black snakes with thick scales and cold eyes. Each of them was more than ten meters in diameter.</p><p>The giant black snake rolled, and the lake water churned violently, stirring up thousands of waves. The waves swept toward many people, and suddenly, many people were swept into the lake, screaming in pain.</p><p>Blackwater mystical snake! It’s a Blackwater mystical snake!</p><p>Someone shouted in fear.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The Blackwater mystical snake was a top level-seven demonic beast. In the Blackwater Lake, it was like a fish in water, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>In the black water lake, a total of six black water Xuan snakes appeared, protecting the cleansing Water lotus in the middle. They swept their tails, bringing up huge waves. No one dared to take it head-on, and they all dodged.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A few white-haired old men shot out beams of divine light, dispersing the lake water and attacking the Blackwater mystical snake.</p><p>it’s an expert at the level of an old monster!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The few elders were extremely powerful, far exceeding the average great circle spirit embryo.</p><p>At the same time, everyone saw that Yang Cong and Wu Kong were also extremely powerful. They rushed forward and fought against black snake and Xuan snake.</p><p>There were also some great circle, ninth and eighth level spirit embryo experts who were charging forward with all their might. The battle on the black water lake was endless and chaotic.</p><p>Lu Ming mixed in with the crowd and rushed forward.</p><p>He had the devouring power, so he was not afraid of the poison in the lake.</p><p>However, he did not rush forward. Instead, he mixed in with the crowd and used his devouring power.</p><p>Many experts had been killed. This was a huge resource. Lu Ming would not waste it.</p><p>He clenched his fist and a powerful devouring force erupted, enveloping those who had been killed. In an instant, the rolling blood essence, true vitality, and intent runes were all devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline began to be refined continuously. Lu Ming’s water concept began to improve rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
