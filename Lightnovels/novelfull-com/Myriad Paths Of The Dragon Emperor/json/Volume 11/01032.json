This time, we have attracted many strong cultivators. I plan to take a walk around the periphery. I will not go deeper. There are too many strong cultivators inside.</p><p>...</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>“Oh, do you need me to accompany you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>In his heart, he was grateful to Zhou Xin. She had given him the Nanyuan stones back then. If Zhou Xin needed help, he would not reject her.</p><p>there’s no need. Uncle Liu and I are weak. If we go with young master Lu, we might drag you down. It’s better for young master Lu to act alone!</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>Hearing Zhou Xin’s words, Lu Ming didn’t force her and bade them farewell. However, before he left, his devouring power erupted and completely devoured the blood essence and true vitality of the two elders with Great Perfection spirit embryos. Lu Ming didn’t want to let go of the blood essence and energy of two great Perfection spirit embryo experts. After devouring them, he continued to move forward.</p><p>Zhou Xin and the middle-aged man were shocked when they saw the two old men turned into two dried corpses.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that young lady seems to have something on. She doesn’t want others to go with her. She’s sending you away on purpose!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had the same feeling. He felt that Zhou Xin had something on and did not want to be with him.</p><p>However, this was someone else’s private matter, so he couldn’t be bothered to care about it. As he walked, he searched for spirit herbs.</p><p>Not long after, the two elders ‘energy was completely refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, the level of his Blood Meridian did not increase. As for Lu Ming’s cultivation, the increase was minimal.</p><p>with my current cultivation, it’s almost useless to devour a great circle spirit embryo martial artist. My progress is too slow. Only by devouring a spirit God expert can I quickly improve!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>The area here was very large. Very soon, Lu Ming had traveled about ten thousand miles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of him, a figure flashed by at a terrifying speed.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that the figure was a bald burly man. He was the spiritual God expert from cold-blood Hall who had chased after him.</p><p>As expected, the cold-blood Hall experts were here.</p><p>The bald man did not notice Lu Ming. He kept flying forward and disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming became more careful and slowed down. He kept running through the forest below.</p><p>Along the way, the harvest was not bad. They collected a lot of spiritual herbs, many of which were level eight spiritual herbs. Dandan could not stop smiling.</p><p>This herb garden was an ancient herb garden. It had been there for a long time and the spiritual Qi was rich. It was normal for the level of the spirit herbs to be higher. Unfortunately, no level nine spirit herbs had been found.</p><p>Level nine spirit herbs were much rarer than level eight spirit herbs.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a continuous flash of light in front of him, and a faint sound came.</p><p>“There’s another battle over there!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he quickly headed in that direction.</p><p>After a few hundred miles, Lu Ming appeared on a mountain peak and looked into the distance.</p><p>There was a Lake in front of them, and in the middle of the lake was a small island. A towering tree stood on the small island.</p><p>This tree was rooted on the island, but its crown was extremely huge, and its area was even larger than the island.</p><p>There were fruits on the tree. The fruits were the size of a face plate and were fiery red in color. They were filled with surging energy.</p><p>“That’s the sky Vermillion fruit!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the fruit. He was shocked and then overjoyed.</p><p>The sky Vermillion fruit was an extremely rare and precious fruit.</p><p>This kind of fruit contained extremely powerful and pure energy. When a warrior consumed it, it could help him break through to the next realm.</p><p>As long as one had reached the realm of the essence realm of heaven and earth, eating this fruit could help one quickly increase their true essence and break through to the next realm.</p><p>This fruit was too precious.</p><p>The spirit embryo realm and the spiritual God Realm after that were not as simple as comprehending intent. Some people had reached the intent realm, but their cultivation was not that easy to improve.</p><p>For example, many second-grade heaven’s favorites, such as Xue Luo Zi and Jun Yue, had reached the fourth level of intent realm. However, their cultivation was still stuck in the spirit embryo realm. This showed how difficult it was to comprehend intent realm and improve their cultivation.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming had the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, unless he could devour spiritual God powerhouses or devour and refine a large number of raw gemstones, it would be troublesome for him to level up.</p><p>However, once he had the sky Vermillion fruit, his cultivation would be able to increase rapidly.</p><p>“I must get this sky Vermillion fruit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright.</p><p>As long as he could obtain a few sky Vermillion fruits, Lu Ming’s cultivation would break through to the perfected spirit embryo realm. This was because his heaven and earth essence realm had already met the requirements.</p><p>However, he was not in a hurry now. That was because the sky Vermillion fruit tree was protected by a large array. A layer of light enveloped the sky Vermillion fruit tree within it.</p><p>There were seven martialists who were constantly bombarding the light screen in an attempt to break the formation.</p><p>The light screen formed by the formation was shaking non-stop, as if it had been there for a long time.</p><p>“It’s almost broken!”</p><p>Some people’s eyes were shining with a fiery light, and at the same time, they were looking at the others vigilantly.</p><p>Previously, they had joined forces to break the formation because they wanted to break it. Now that the formation was about to be broken, they began to have their own ulterior motives.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light flashed. One of the green-robed elders attacked an old woman beside him.</p><p>“I knew you would make a move!”</p><p>The old woman let out a roar and waved her hands, sending out palm prints to fight the old man.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An iron rod swept out towards the green-robed old man. The green-robed old man was caught off guard and his head was hit. He was killed before he could even scream.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, kill!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The formation had yet to be broken, and the remaining six people were in complete chaos, fighting each other.</p><p>These people were all experts, at least at the sixth level of spirit embryo realm. They were rogue cultivators from the nearby area who had been attracted by the light pillar.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, two screams rang out, and two of the weaker cultivators were killed. The battle between the remaining four was even more intense.</p><p>At this moment, a figure stepped through the air and arrived.</p><p>“Pure spatial spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>This woman who came from the sky stepped on the clouds with her Jade-like feet. Her entire body was shrouded in clouds and mist, like an ethereal fairy. Who else could she be if not Jing kongling?</p><p>“Pure spatial spirit!”</p><p>The four of them were in the middle of a battle, but when they saw Jing kongling, they were all shocked and stopped fighting.</p><p>“The sky Vermillion fruit is mine, you guys can leave!”</p><p>The pure and ethereal voice was very calm and ethereal, without any emotion.</p><p>Jing kongling, you’re too overbearing. We found the sky Vermillion fruit tree first. We’re about to break through the formation too. Now that you’ve appeared, you want to take it all for yourself? you’re too greedy.</p><p>An old woman called out.</p><p>you can stay here, forever!</p><p>The pure spatial spirit spoke calmly, but the aura on her body was extremely strong. A few streams of water appeared around her, turning into a few water dragons that danced around her.</p><p>The four of them looked very upset. They were unwilling to accept this, but they knew that with their cultivation, they would definitely die if they were to fight against Jing kongling. This was the top heaven’s favorite of the central continent, and his combat strength was too strong.</p><p>“Hehe, these few pieces of trash indeed need to get lost first!”</p><p>An ear-piercing sneer suddenly rang out. In the distance, a rainbow light flew over at extreme speed. The next moment, a red-haired old man appeared in the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
