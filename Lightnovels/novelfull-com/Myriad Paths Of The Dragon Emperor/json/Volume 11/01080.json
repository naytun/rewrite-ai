Since the token was fake, there was no need for them to continue fighting.</p><p>After that, the people from the other forces also left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not leave. He fixed his eyes on a person. It was a slightly chubby young man who looked very simple and honest. However, his eyes were darting around, giving Lu Ming a familiar feeling.</p><p>“Fairy, brother Kong, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were stunned for a moment. Then, they nodded and followed Lu Ming in a certain direction.</p><p>In front of him, the plain young man was walking slowly among the mountains. His steps did not seem fast, but his speed was extremely fast.</p><p>The three of them concealed their auras and followed the young man in the forest.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were curious. They did not know why Lu Ming wanted to follow this young man. Could it be that Lu Ming had noticed something?</p><p>After traveling for ten thousand miles, the young man in front of him stopped. He looked around, and with a flash of light, his appearance changed completely. He turned into a monk.</p><p>An unscrupulous monk!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at one glance that this monk was the unscrupulous monk he had met previously.</p><p>“The Holy monk of the Western Desert!”</p><p>The three of them hid behind a rock and concealed their auras as much as possible. Kong Xin transmitted her voice to the other two.</p><p>He could only transmit his voice because the distance was too close. If he spoke, no matter how soft his voice was, the unscrupulous monk would still be able to hear him.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>At this time, the monk sighed and reached into his pocket. He took out a purple-gold token.</p><p>The three of them were dumbfounded. Wasn’t this the token of the Saint mansion? It was exactly the same as the previous one.</p><p>“My hair is white, my Buddha is merciful. It’s a pity that only a few experts died this time. Yang potian and Tuoba Shi were not injured. I was thinking that both of them would suffer great losses!”</p><p>The monk mumbled softly but Lu Ming and the other two heard him clearly.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other, especially fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin, whose eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>It was actually this guy.</p><p>It was this guy who threw out the fake Saint mansion token and started the war.</p><p>Weren’t Western Desert’s Saint monks supposed to be merciful and save all sentient beings? But how could this guy do such a thing?</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were really in a daze.</p><p>Lu Ming was better off as he was mentally prepared. He had seen how unscrupulous this monk was previously.</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to do it again!”</p><p>The heartless monk muttered and revealed a harmless smile. He waved his sleeves and strode away.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two stared at each other. In the end, they did not continue to follow them. They returned to the place where the battle had taken place and gathered with the people from the Tianxia Academy and the valley of medicine Masters.</p><p>“Brother Kong, why haven’t we been able to get close to the Holy mansion? I’ve flown for millions of miles, but it still seems extremely far away!”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>“The Saint mansion should be several million li ahead, but because it hasn’t fully manifested yet, it looks extremely far away and can’t be approached. In fact, we’ve been approaching it all this time!”</p><p>Kong Xin explained. The Tianxia Academy knew the most about the secret realm of the Saint mansion.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He flew in the direction of the Saint mansion with the rest.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles later.</p><p>“There’s a Holy mansion token up ahead!”</p><p>“What? The Holy mansion’s token is mine!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>They heard loud shouts as figures tore through the void and flew in one direction.</p><p>“That monk is stirring things up again!”</p><p>Kong Xin gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look, but don’t make a move!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>Everyone flew over. Sure enough, a terrifying battle had taken place in a place, and corpses kept falling.</p><p>They saw a chubby young man in the forest below. His eyes were rolling. It was the transformation of the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>At this moment, the monk was running around and picking up the storage rings of the dead.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>“Is he really a Saint monk from the Western Desert? It can’t be fake, right?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s eyes widened in disbelief. This had completely shattered her understanding of Western Desert’s Saint monk.</p><p>it should be true. I’ve fought with him before, and I used a Buddhist technique!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This unscrupulous monk was unfathomable. He was young, but his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the others left the place because the token of the Saint mansion must be fake. It must be that unscrupulous monk who was stirring up trouble.</p><p>The group flew for millions of miles.</p><p>In front of them, a huge mountain peak appeared. The mountain peak was bare, without any vegetation, only rocks. At this time, the entire mountain peak was covered with inscriptions that were shining brightly.</p><p>High up in the sky, the wind and clouds gathered, and the huge Palace was faintly discernible. It seemed to be in the sky, but it had not fully manifested.</p><p>There were thousands of figures standing far away from the mountain peak. They were all experts from the major forces.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Terrifying roars were heard. On the mountain peak, dozens of powerful beasts were fighting fiercely, and blood Qi filled the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked from afar and were extremely shocked.</p><p>In the secret realm, those powerful existences were coming here, but they were fighting each other on the mountain peak. Why was that?</p><p>The roars continued, and the battle was extremely fierce. Those who could make it here were all at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm and above. They were killing each other.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>A Wolf’s howl was incomparably mournful. Lu Ming saw a huge Silver Wolf over a hundred meters tall. However, its heart was grabbed by a huge Eagle and it fell on the mountain peak. Its blood seeped into the mountain peak, making it shine even more brightly.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The giant Eagle was not in a good state either. Its wings were grabbed by a giant ape and torn off with a tearing sound. Then, its stomach was cut open by a giant centipede.</p><p>They were all giant beasts in an intense battle. Giant beasts fell and were torn apart one after another.</p><p>A huge snake the size of a mountain was cut into pieces by a huge Mantis. However, the Mantis’s head was also bitten off by the huge snake before it died.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>There were more and more people, but all of them stopped far away from the mountain peak and looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>Half a day later, all the giant beasts had fallen on the mountain peak. Their blood had seeped into the mountain peak, as if they had become nourishment for the mountain.</p><p>In the sky, the ancient palace rumbled as wind and clouds gathered, as if it would appear at any moment.</p><p>At this moment, everyone finally dared to approach the mountain.</p><p>At a glance, Lu Ming saw more than five thousand people.</p><p>Lu Ming saw yang potian, Tuoba Shi, and the divine Emperor.</p><p>“Junior Brother Wu, is he the person you were talking about?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice was heard and a murderous gaze was fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and frowned.</p><p>A group of young and middle-aged men with swords on their backs stood not far away. Some of them were looking at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>Wu chengkong!</p><p>Lu Ming saw Wu chengkong inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
