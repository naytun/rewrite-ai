He had long heard that this generation was full of prodigies, experts were as common as clouds, and the battle strength of the younger generation was extremely terrifying.</p><p>...</p><p>However, he had only heard of it and did not take it to heart.</p><p>No matter how talented he was, as long as he had not entered the spiritual God Realm, how strong could he be? But now, he realized that it was really strong, far beyond his expectations.</p><p>It could only be said that his talent limited his imagination.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The battle between the three of them caused their forces to be unbridled. Many of the forces poured down on the sky Vermillion fruit tree. The light shield that enveloped the sky Vermillion fruit tree shook violently. In the end, it actually exploded with a bang.</p><p>The formation was about to be broken, but it was easily broken by the three’s powerful Qi.</p><p>The formation was broken and the three of them turned to look at the sky Vermillion fruit.</p><p>The hellhound roared and pounced towards the sky Vermillion fruit tree.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few consecutive punches at the hellhound. Each punch seemed to be able to shatter the space. At the same time, the purifying air spirit also suppressed the hellhound.</p><p>The two of them blocked the hellhound.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Dandan turned into a ray of light and pounced towards the sky Vermillion fruit tree.</p><p>“If I can’t get it, you can forget about getting it!”</p><p>The hellhound let out a furious roar as flames burst out from its body. Countless flames scattered in all directions. Some of them were directed at Lu Ming and the pure spatial spirit, while some were directed at the Vermillion sky fruit tree.</p><p>He wanted to destroy the sky Vermillion fruit tree.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Dandan cursed in anger. He waved his claws and countless runes appeared in the sky, forming a formation to block the flames. At the same time, he opened his mouth and sucked in the sky Vermillion fruits.</p><p>After swallowing a few, he ran to the other side and grabbed a few more sky Vermillion fruits with his claws, stuffing them into his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He waved his claws and grabbed a dozen sky Vermillion fruits.</p><p>And this sky Vermillion fruit tree only had a total of a dozen sky Vermillion fruits, and almost all of them had been picked by dandan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the formation that dandan had set up was broken through by the flames. Endless flames poured down on the sky Vermillion fruit tree.</p><p>Dandan could not be bothered. She ran wildly and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>The flames descended and the sky Vermillion fruit tree was reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p>“Hand over the sky Vermillion fruit!”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui roared.</p><p>“Nonsense, kill!”</p><p>The essential core in his body exploded. At this moment, Lu Ming pushed the prison suppressing heaven technique to its limits. All the essential core in his body was instantly sucked dry. However, the power he released was terrifying. With one punch, the hellhound let out a shrill cry and staggered backward. Immediately after, the round bead that was transformed from the clear spirit pressed down and forced the hellhound to retreat.</p><p>“Damn it, just you wait!”</p><p>Seeing that there was no hope of snatching the sky Vermillion fruit, venerable Chi kui turned around and left after leaving behind these harsh words, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bead trembled and the pristine Void Spirit returned to its human form.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming with a gaze filled with surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength seemed to be stronger than the last time he fought with blood Luo Zi. More importantly, Lu Ming had not activated his Blood Meridian, which made her feel that he was unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead and frowned slightly. miss Kong Ling, someone else is here. Let’s leave this place first!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Jing kongling nodded and the two of them flew back.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the pristine Void Spirit left, a terrifying Sonic Boom was heard from afar. A figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would have recognized the man at a glance. He was the bald man from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>The bald man muttered, ” there was clearly a huge battle just now. They must have been fighting for treasures. But now, they’re gone. They’re running quite fast!</p><p>Suddenly, the bald man’s brows twitched and he muttered, ” “It’s the aura of that Lu brat. Hmph, let’s see where you can run to this time!”</p><p>With that, the bald man followed the aura and chased in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had left.</p><p>The two of them flew for ten thousand miles and came to a Valley.</p><p>“Dandan, how many sky Vermillion fruits did you get? take them out!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>“There are 15 in total. We’ll split them evenly!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“You want to split it equally?”</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes.</p><p>“Of course. Without me, you wouldn’t have gotten a single one!”</p><p>Dandan stuck her claws in the air, looking very proud.</p><p>brother Lu, it’s fine. I have five!</p><p>Qing Junling said.</p><p>“Alright, hand over the sky Vermillion fruit!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Dandan opened her mouth and ten sky Vermillion fruits flew out. Lu Ming took five and the pristine Void Spirit took five.</p><p>brother Lu, thank you for your help this time. I’m going to find a place to refine the sky Vermillion fruit now. I’ll take my leave now!</p><p>The pristine Void Spirit cupped his fists and bade Lu Ming farewell.</p><p>“I’m also looking for a place to refine the sky Vermillion fruit. Goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists and did not say much. The two of them stepped into the air and left in different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming flew for another 10000 miles and made a small hole in a big mountain. He flew in until he reached the belly of the mountain and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, the bald man arrived.</p><p>his aura has disappeared again. There must be some treasure hiding his aura. He must be nearby. I’ll wait nearby. As soon as that Lu guy appears, I’ll kill him with lightning speed!</p><p>The bald man’s eyes flickered with a cold light. Then, he flew into the sky and hid in a cloud.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram and sat cross-legged on one of the mountain peaks.</p><p>“Dandan, you’ve plucked more than fifteen sky Vermillion fruits, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>He knew dandan all too well. She definitely wasn’t telling the truth just now.</p><p>“Hey, Lu Ming, what do you mean by this? Are you suspecting me? You’re doubting my character, no, my turtle character, you know?”</p><p>Dandan immediately glared at Lu Ming unhappily.</p><p>what’s there to be suspicious about? I don’t believe that you’ve only plucked 15 sky Vermillion fruits!</p><p>Lu Ming replied calmly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Flustered and exasperated, under Lu Ming’s gaze, she said guiltily, ” “Alright, I actually plucked 16!”</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … I … Alright, it’s actually seventeen.”</p><p>“You’re still looking? alright, it’s eighteen!”</p><p>haha, 20, only 20, really only 20!</p><p>In the end, dandan smiled awkwardly and spat out ten more pills from her mouth. She pointed to the heavens and swore that she only had this much left.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He knew that this guy would keep it to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and took three more pills, leaving seven for dandan.</p><p>This made dandan sigh. If she did not need Lu Ming to help her find more elixirs, she would have fallen out with him.</p><p>“Eight sky Vermillion fruits should be enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He took out one and enveloped the sky Vermillion fruit with devouring power. He began to absorb the medicinal effects of the fruit and cultivate.</p><p>The sky Vermillion fruit was a rare spirit fruit that contained an infinite amount of energy essence. It was different from many other spirit herbs and spirit fruits. The energy essence in the sky Vermillion fruit was very pure and was very similar to a warrior’s true Yuan. It also had almost no impurities and could be refined very quickly, helping one to improve their cultivation and break through to the next realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
