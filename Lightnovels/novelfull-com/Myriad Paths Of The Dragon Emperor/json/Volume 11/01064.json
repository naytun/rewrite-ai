Their strength was extremely powerful and unfathomable.</p><p>...</p><p>There were also many whose auras were weaker than Supremes, but that was only in comparison. In fact, they were also extremely powerful and were definitely high-level spiritual gods.</p><p>“The Saint mansion, the Saint mansion has opened!”</p><p>the Saint mansion that hasn’t been opened for thirty thousand years has actually opened.</p><p>“The headmaster’s decision is correct!”</p><p>The voices echoed in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, an old man stepped out and rushed towards one of the light pillars.</p><p>However, as soon as he rushed in, a look of horror appeared on his face and he let out a miserable scream. The next moment, his body exploded, and his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>Many people gasped and shivered.</p><p>The old man was definitely a high-level spiritual God, but he had died just like that.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>“How could this be? It’s said that anyone can enter the Holy mansion, so why did elder Wu die?”</p><p>A voice of disbelief was heard from the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>30,000 years ago, no matter if it was male or female, old or young, no matter how strong one’s cultivation was, they could enter the Saint mansion to find opportunities and cultivate there.</p><p>But just now, why did that old man die?</p><p>“Has the rules of the Saint mansion changed?”</p><p>Someone made a guess.</p><p>Many people thought it was possible. After all, the Saint mansion had been closed for thirty thousand years. It was possible that the rules had changed.</p><p>In this way, no one dared to act rashly. No one knew if they would die if they rushed in.</p><p>After that, the Tianxia Academy sent experts to investigate and see what was going on.</p><p>The news of the reopening of the sage mansion of the world Academy spread like a storm.</p><p>“Dandan, do you know what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming brought dandan to a mountain peak a hundred miles away and asked.</p><p>according to my speculation, those nine pillars of light are the spatial paths, the passages to the secret realm. However, these passages contain an aging array, which has a requirement for the age of the entrants. However, I haven’t studied the specific age restrictions, so I’m not too sure!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“There’s an age requirement? That’s strange!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. According to the rumors, there was no age limit in this Mystic realm thirty thousand years ago.</p><p>However, there was no point in overthinking. Lu Ming then cultivated while waiting for news.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to miss it if he could enter the secret realm. It was said that there were great opportunities in the secret realm. In the past, there were often ultimate powerhouses cultivating in there. If those ultimate powerhouses could leave something behind, it would be a great opportunity.</p><p>That was because the strongest people in the world were all emperors.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people came to the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>Many major forces received the news and a large number of people rushed over.</p><p>In fact, some of the Overlord forces even sent their Supreme martial artists.</p><p>For example, the forces closest to the Tianxia Academy, such as the floating mountain, cold-blood Hall, Sky Eagle Castle, tianwu sword sect, demon mountain, and the Ji family.</p><p>There were also many people from smaller forces.</p><p>Even more geniuses had arrived. For a time, the world’s Academies were filled with strong people.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><p>At this time, the Tianxia Academy released news that they had already investigated the rules of the entrance to the secret realm of the Saint mansion. Only creatures under the age of 50 could enter. Those above the age of 50 would die if they entered.</p><p>Moreover, the Tianxia Academy and the Supreme leaders of the various forces had already discussed that anyone from the major forces could enter. However, because there were too many people who came to the Tianxia Academy, many of them were below the age of 50. It was obviously not feasible for so many people to enter. Therefore, the Tianxia Academy planned to conduct a screening. Only those whose combat strength had reached a certain level could enter.</p><p>It was said that the secret realm of the Saint mansion was very dangerous. If one didn’t have enough combat power, they would die.</p><p>A day later, a huge array rose in a huge square of the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>This array was the selection place. Anyone under the age of 50 could come here to participate in the general selection. Only those who passed could enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion.</p><p>The square was surrounded by a sea of people. Countless people from all the major forces had gathered.</p><p>Lu Ming was also among the crowd.</p><p>There were some people standing in the sky. Many of them were old men, and some of them looked young. Everyone knew that these people were the Supreme-being experts of the major forces.</p><p>in this formation, puppets will be formed. You guys can enter and kill them. Every time you kill a puppet, there will be essence Qi covering your body. At first, it will be red, but as more and more essence Qi is gathered, the color of your essence Qi will change. Then, it will be orange, yellow, green, and finally purple.</p><p>only when the color of the spiritual essence gathered in your body reaches yellow will you pass the test and enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion. If you don’t reach the yellow color, you will be eliminated. The test begins now!</p><p>In the sky, an old man from the Tianxia Academy announced the selection rules.</p><p>The rules were simple. They had to enter the formation, kill the puppets, and accumulate essence Qi. Once the essence Qi reached a certain standard, they would pass the test.</p><p>As soon as the old man finished speaking, many people rushed into the formation.</p><p>There were many young men, but most of them looked to be in their thirties or forties.</p><p>This time, those below the age of fifty could enter. Those who were fifty were half to one generation older than Lu Ming’s generation. Naturally, there were more people.</p><p>This formation could accommodate tens of thousands of people at the same time.</p><p>However, a few minutes later, people were continuously being teleported out. They were covered in a layer of light, but they were all red.</p><p>He had clearly been eliminated.</p><p>these people haven’t even reached the spirit embryo realm, so they naturally can’t enter!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He could tell the cultivation of these people.</p><p>More than ten minutes later, more people were eliminated. Many of these people were covered in an orange glow, but they were still eliminated. Most of these people’s cultivation was below the sixth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>After that, the people who were teleported out were all covered in yellow.</p><p>These people all revealed looks of joy, because they had succeeded. As long as the light on their bodies reached yellow, it would be considered a success.</p><p>it seems that it’s more or less enough to reach the sixth level spirit embryo realm and above!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. He realized that the people who had succeeded were generally at the sixth level spirit embryo realm or above. However, there were also young prodigies whose cultivation was below the sixth level spirit embryo realm, but their combat strength had obviously reached the sixth level spirit embryo realm or above.</p><p>More than an hour later, the first batch of people who went in came out.</p><p>The strongest few people were covered in purple light, which was extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Jun Yue and Xue Luo Zi were all covered in purple light. However, most of the people who were covered in purple light were in their thirties or forties.</p><p>These people had been cultivating for a long time, and their combat strength was very strong.</p><p>In the second batch, tens of thousands of people entered. From this, it could be seen how many people were gathered in Tianxia Academy. And this was only for those below the age of 50. If there was no age limit, the number of people would be terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming was also in the second group. Once he stepped into the formation, a puppet that looked like a demonic beast formed and pounced at him.</p><p>“Those below the spirit embryo realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch, turning all the puppets into dust. At the same time, red essence Qi flew over and covered Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Following that, more puppets were formed. However, they were too weak and were easily killed by Lu Ming. The light that enveloped Lu Ming’s body also slowly solidified and brightened.</p><p>Slowly, the strength of the puppets that appeared became stronger and stronger. They had reached the spirit embryo realm, but Lu Ming still dealt with them with a single punch.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
