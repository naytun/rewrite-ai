The spear force was like the ocean, with raging waves hitting the shore and the ocean being boundless, destroying everything.</p><p>...</p><p>strong, he’s too strong. Retreat, retreat!</p><p>The hearts of the spectators sped up in fear as they watched this move. It was as if they were about to be crushed by the ocean in the next moment.</p><p>Countless people cried out in alarm and retreated in panic.</p><p>A ‘ke, a’ Lei, and the others stood on the ground. They had the same feeling. They felt like they were going to be turned into ashes the next moment. However, there was an imposing figure in front of them. He burst out with a shocking aura and blocked everything for them.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A faint Dragon’s Roar came from his body. Two streams of dragon energy burst forth, causing Lu Ming’s body to glow with purple light again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming put away the infinite Dragon Spear. He stepped forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>This palm was very ordinary, but it seemed to have the power to suppress the heavens and split everything.</p><p>With a loud boom, everyone was shocked to see that the sea seemed to have been split in half by Lu Ming’s palm. Endless sea water swept in and then collapsed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the middle of the ocean, a blue spear also collapsed. In the next moment, the ocean disappeared, and so did the spear. The sky above Lishui City returned to its usual tranquility, and only a figure could be seen retreating rapidly, leaving a trail of blood in the air.</p><p>Countless people looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>This was because the person who had retreated was hai Ziming.</p><p>Hai Ziming was defeated and retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>Oh my God, even hai Ziming was defeated. Lu Shaoqing’s combat power is too shocking.</p><p>in the entire central continent, hai Ziming was about to be ranked as a third-class heaven’s favorite, but he still lost. Could Lu Shaoqing be a third-class heaven’s favorite? ”</p><p>that’s possible. Lu Shaoqing is a third-class heaven’s favorite. That’s terrifying!</p><p>The surroundings were in an uproar. Countless people looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Impossible, how is that possible?”</p><p>Ling yunkong roared. His eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated hai Ziming. How could he be so strong?</p><p>One had to know that there were not many people in the vast central continent who could defeat hai Ziming.</p><p>After all, in the vast central continent, there were only 18 Overlord forces. Even if some of the weaker forces also had peerless heaven’s favorites, how many could there be?</p><p>Ling yunkong was furious, but the Xiao family was ecstatic.</p><p>They were saved.</p><p>Ling yunkong swore a blood oath that if hai Ziming was defeated, he would not touch the Xiao family in any way.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Hai Ziming stood in the air, his eyes full of surprise.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that hai Ziming’s talent was not inferior to that of Wang fentian, Dongfang Yu, and the others from the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, it’s a pity that you didn’t participate in the battle of Providence with your talent and combat strength. However, the battle of Providence is only one of the stops for us to rise. Even if you didn’t participate, I believe that you can rise with your talent!</p><p>Hai Ziming cupped his fists and revealed a look of admiration.</p><p>He was very free and honest, completely different from Ling yunkong.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He nodded in his heart. This was normal. It was impossible for everyone to be like Ling yunkong. Otherwise, the floating mountain sect would really not be far from destruction.</p><p>“The battle is over. Ling yunkong, from now on, we don’t owe each other anything!”</p><p>Hai Ziming said as he looked at Ling yunkong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that hai Ziming owed Ling yunkong a favor and that was why he helped him.</p><p>With that, hai Ziming’s figure moved, turning into a rainbow light and disappearing into the sky.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’re still not leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Ling yunkong.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Ling yunkong flicked his sleeve. He wanted to make things difficult for them, but he had already taken a blood oath, so he could only grit his teeth and leave.</p><p>In fact, he couldn’t even order others to deal with the Xiao family in the future.</p><p>In an instant, not a single person from the floating mountain martial school remained.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the Xiao family and waved his hand. Essential core surged out and the essential core that sealed their cultivation was broken by Lu Ming. They regained their freedom.</p><p>“Thank you, young master Lu!”</p><p>Thank you, young master Lu, for saving my life!</p><p>The Xiao family members thanked Lu Ming profusely.</p><p>This time, without Lu Ming, they would most likely be dead.</p><p>“Everyone, you don’t have to be so polite. From now on, Ling yunkong won’t make things difficult for the Xiao family. You can recall the other members of the Xiao family. I will go and fetch senior Xiao and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone from the Xiao family nodded and moved in batches.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and headed towards the small island.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s departure, the crowd dispersed as well. However, Lu Shaoqing’s name had spread throughout the entire Lishui City at an alarming rate. It was believed that it would not be long before it spread throughout the territory controlled by the floating mountain sect.</p><p>Many people were curious as to who Lu Shaoqing was, to suddenly appear after the battle of Providence.</p><p>……</p><p>When Xiao Zhan, a ‘Lei, and a’ Luo heard the specific news, they were overjoyed and grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had completely resolved this matter. They did not need to run away in the future.</p><p>Everyone returned to the Xiao family. Xiao Zhan made arrangements for the Xiao family to begin rebuilding the Xiao mansion. Because the Xiao family was previously affected by the war, many of their buildings were destroyed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>Time flew by, and another ten days had passed. His water concept was slowly approaching level three upper tier.</p><p>He was getting closer and closer to the other concepts.</p><p>On this day, a piece of news quickly spread throughout the entire Lishui City.</p><p>To the west of the city, there was a Black Lake. In the middle of the Black Lake, there was a pristine water lotus that was about to mature.</p><p>“It’s actually the cleansing Water lotus throne? Let’s go, we can’t miss this!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>As soon as the news spread, countless people were tempted and headed to the west of the city.</p><p>However, there were also many people who were more sensible and did not go.</p><p>the pure water lotus platform is so precious. It’s very useful for the cultivation of the water mentality or the cultivation techniques of the water nature. It can even help one break through the bottleneck. It will definitely attract a lot of experts. Even many old monsters who have been living in seclusion for many years will appear!</p><p>that’s right. Although the pristine water lotus platform is not of much use to a fourth-level will, it is of great help to a third-level will. Especially when a third-level will breaks through to the fourth-level, it will be extremely useful. By that time, there will be many experts. If we go, we will only be courting death!</p><p>These people sneered and did not move. They just waited for news in Lishui City.</p><p>“Pure water lotus throne!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed when he heard the news.</p><p>He had to get the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>As long as he got the pure water lotus throne, his water mentality would have a huge improvement in a short time. It might even surpass the other four mentalities and catch up.</p><p>In this case, his cultivation base could start to improve again.</p><p>It had been more than half a year, but his cultivation had not improved. Now, the other geniuses who had participated in the battle of Providence were all cultivating in seclusion, digesting what they had gained. Their cultivation would definitely improve at a rapid pace.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the cultivation of di Shen, Xue Jianyi, ao tu, and the others must have far surpassed his.</p><p>Lu Ming had to quickly improve his water concept so that he could continue to improve his cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
