It shone with light and pressed down on Xue Feng.</p><p>...</p><p>Enveloped by the light of the gate of sealing, blood seal was frozen in the air.</p><p>He tried his best to burst out his true essence in an attempt to break the door seal. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation had now advanced to the second level of the spiritual God Realm. The door seal that he had condensed was even more powerful. For a moment, the blood seal could not be broken at all.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>He was extremely anxious and kept growling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and the sword light slashed down. With a bang, the blood leopard was cut in half. Xue Feng’s true body appeared, spitting out a large mouthful of blood and a deep wound on his chest.</p><p>He wanted to retreat, but the sealing door was still there. He could not even retreat.</p><p>“No, no, spare my life!”</p><p>no! Xue Feng shouted in fear, but what greeted him was a sword light.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Xue Feng was split in half, and even the spiritual God in his body couldn’t escape.</p><p>All of this happened in the time it took for a spark to fly off a piece of Flint. It happened so fast that many people didn’t even have time to react. It was already too late for the two experts of the sky martial sword faction to rescue him.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The two experts from the heavenly martial sword faction were about to launch a fierce attack on Lu Ming. When they saw this scene, their pupils constricted and they subconsciously stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around.</p><p>Xue Feng was dead. He was killed by Lu Ming in two moves. He could not put up any resistance at all. How was this possible?</p><p>Xue Feng had awakened a seventh level divine level bloodline and his cultivation had already reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was absolutely terrifying, but he was easily killed by Lu Ming. It was unbelievable.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, and the people from Medicine King’s Valley and Tianxia Academy were also dumbfounded. They were completely stunned and couldn’t believe this scene.</p><p>Wu chengkong was tongue-tied and almost scared to death.</p><p>It had only been a few days. A few days ago, Lu Ming could only fight to a draw with Xue Feng. With the help of the sealing door, he barely had the upper hand. But now, he had completely crushed Xue Feng.</p><p>It had only been a few days and Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a huge margin. This was too shocking.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the two experts from the heavenly Sword faction. His blood-red hair fluttered in the wind, and his killing intent surged.</p><p>The expressions of the two experts from the heavenly martial Sword School changed drastically, and they no longer had the confidence they had earlier.</p><p>“Brother Lu, in my opinion, this is all a misunderstanding!”</p><p>One of them revealed a smile that was uglier than crying.</p><p>They were terrified that Lu Ming could kill Xue Feng in such a thunderous way even though he was surrounded by the three of them.</p><p>“Misunderstanding? No, there’s no misunderstanding. I’m going to kill you today. I don’t need a reason!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. In the next moment, he took a step forward and rushed toward the two of them like a bloody light.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“Let’s attack together and kill this brat!”</p><p>The two of them roared and activated their bloodlines at the same time, turning them into two huge combat swords. Without a doubt, both of them had seventh level divine level bloodlines and had comprehended divine level martial techniques. Their combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. The other experts of the heavenly Sword faction all moved. Their combat swords were unsheathed, and their sword Qi soared to the sky as they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>The blood-red sword floated in his hands and formed a seal. A sealing gate flew out and covered a huge sword. In an instant, the huge sword could not move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his combat sword and sent one of the combat swords flying. At the same time, he took a few steps forward and the terrifying power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps suddenly burst out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He took seven steps and landed on the sword that was sealed by the door. The sword immediately collapsed and its body appeared. However, there was a flash of sword light and the head fell to the ground.</p><p>This person’s spiritual God flew out of his body in a panic and was extremely frightened.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s left hand executed the prison-suppressing heaven technique and he struck out continuously. He held the Blood Sword in his right hand and executed the five styles massacre.</p><p>Clang! The remaining fourth level spiritual God Realm expert’s combat sword was sent flying, and the sword’s body kept shaking.</p><p>The blood-red sword slashed out tens of thousands of sword Qi. The spiritual God that escaped let out a blood-curdling scream before turning into ashes.</p><p>At the same time, a few experts from the heavenly Sword faction who had rushed over were killed by the sword Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a god of death and charged towards the last fourth level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>Escape, escape, escape!</p><p>At this moment, the person was scared out of his wits and was running for his life. Lu Ming was too powerful. In terms of strength alone, Lu Ming had completely surpassed him.</p><p>Together with the sealing door, they were simply invincible.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on him. He dashed past him and killed a few more experts from the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming closed in at top speed. He formed a seal with both hands and another sealing door appeared.</p><p>The combat sword was instantly fixed in place. Lu Ming charged forward.</p><p>“No, spare me, help!”</p><p>The man roared, but the result was already decided. Lu Ming caught up and killed him with lightning-like methods.</p><p>Since then, the three experts who wanted to kill Lu Ming were all killed by him. Not a single one was left alive. He even killed a few experts from the sky martial Sword School.</p><p>When the other members of the heavenly martial sword faction saw this, they were extremely frightened. How could they dare to fight? They all fled.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The rest of the people at the scene looked at Lu Ming in shock. They were tongue-tied and completely speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too shocking to be able to kill three experts in succession.</p><p>High up in the sky, yang potian and Tuoba Shi looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions. Before this, they had not paid attention to anyone else except for each other. However, Lu Ming had now attracted their attention.</p><p>“It seems that we have another opponent!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi licked his lips as his eyes gleamed with battle intent.</p><p>Yang potian’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that the battle had ended, Lu Ming did not stop because there was still one person who had not died.</p><p>Wu chengkong!</p><p>Wu chengkong was running for his life, terrified.</p><p>damn it! How is this Lu Shaoqing so terrifying? his combat strength is rising too quickly. When we get out of here, I’ll have the powerful cultivators in the sect kill him. He can’t be allowed to live!</p><p>All kinds of vengeful thoughts swirled in Wu chengkong’s mind. Suddenly, he heard a whooshing sound. He looked back in shock and saw that Lu Ming had already arrived behind him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. He threw a punch and shattered Wu chengkong into pieces.</p><p>However, Wu chengkong obviously had a destiny talisman. With a flash of white light, the destiny talisman wrapped him up and he disappeared in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly and flew back to his original spot.</p><p>At that moment, everyone looked at Lu Ming with respect.</p><p>He was too powerful. Lu Ming’s combat strength was far above that of an ordinary second-grade heaven’s favorite. His combat strength was already on par with the five magnates.</p><p>It seemed that there would be another young giant in the world.</p><p>“Brother Lu …”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s beautiful eyes flickered as she looked at Lu Ming. She was at a loss for words.</p><p>Oh, I just happened to have a breakthrough in my cultivation when I left two days ago!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin roared in their hearts. This was too abnormal. He had broken through after leaving for two days. This was too fast. It was really infuriating to compare.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
