Ling yunkong’s bloodline. Is this a fifth rank divine bloodline? ”</p><p>...</p><p>the legendary divine beast, the divine water elephant. It is as famous as the ancient war elephant and can control all the water in the world!</p><p>Exclamations of shock came from all around.</p><p>Ling yunkong performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into the divine water elephant.</p><p>The divine water elephant was a thousand meters tall, towering into the clouds and covering the sky.</p><p>It let out a long roar, and the entire Lishui City trembled. Countless people looked at the huge creature in the sky in shock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine water elephant stepped forward and stomped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A ‘an, a’ Lei, and Xiao Zhan were extremely frightened. This kind of power was too amazing, as if it could destroy the world.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were still as calm as water. The spear in his hand grew larger again, becoming thousands of meters long. It was indomitable, stirring the wind and clouds.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear radiance shot toward the divine water elephant.</p><p>The clouds in the sky were directly split apart, allowing the Starlight to fall.</p><p>The divine water elephant let out a long cry and curled its trunk, which was hundreds of meters long, toward the spear radiance.</p><p>A deafening boom resounded and the space trembled. However, the final result was shocking. The five-colored spear radiance destroyed the elephant’s trunk like rotten wood and struck the divine water elephant’s trunk.</p><p>The divine water elephant let out a wail and its huge body retreated. It stepped in the air, causing ripples to appear in the air.</p><p>“Ling yunkong is going to be defeated!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone was extremely shocked. Ling yunkong had even used the fusion of bloodlines, but he was still no match for them. He was about to lose.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was as small as an ant, but he waved his thousand-meter long spear and continuously bombarded the divine water elephant.</p><p>After a few consecutive explosions, the divine water elephant let out a blood-curdling screech and exploded with a bang, turning into Ling yunkong’s appearance.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. Blood was spurting out of his mouth like a fountain. He didn’t dare to stay any longer. He immediately turned into a blade light and flew into the distance at an extreme speed, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Kid, just you wait!”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not pursue.</p><p>He did have some apprehensions, not because of himself, but because of the Xiao family.</p><p>After all, Ling yunkong was one of the ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain sect. If he were to be killed, the floating mountain sect might be enraged and send out a few spiritual God Realm experts. He could just Pat his butt and leave, and the Xiao family would be in trouble.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not give chase.</p><p>At this moment, the people who were watching the battle looked at Lu Ming with awe, shock, and curiosity.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Ling yunkong. This meant that he was a more powerful genius than Ling yunkong. But why had he never heard of Lu Shaoqing’s name?</p><p>Did this kid really not participate in the battle of Providence?</p><p>“Lu … Big brother!”</p><p>A-Qing and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>They had never expected Lu Ming to be so powerful that even Ling yunkong was not his match. What kind of ability was that?</p><p>Was this still the young man who had been injured by the demonic beast?</p><p>They thought of how Lu Ming looked when they first met him in the chaotic mountains. At that moment, their beautiful big eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Back then, they had met Lu Ming because a level eight vicious beast had gone into a rage. At that time, they had thought that Lu Ming had been implicated and injured by some other smaller vicious beasts because of the level eight demonic beast’s rage. Now that they thought about it, perhaps the level eight demonic beast’s rage was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming was injured was probably because he was attacked by that level-eight demonic beast and not some small demonic beast.</p><p>Xiao Zhan was even more surprised. He had been cultivating for many years, and he knew very well how strong Ling yunkong was. At his peak, he was at the peak of the fifth level of spirit embryo realm. However, in front of Ling yunkong, he was definitely killed in a second. But Ling yunkong was easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll leave first!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the long spear disappeared. He smiled at ah Luo and the rest.</p><p>“Ah, yes, okay!”</p><p>As if they had just woken up from a dream, the four of them headed out of the city.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not care about defeating Ling yunkong. To him, Ling yunkong was not his match at all.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s cultivation was weaker than his. He had not even used the power of his bloodline. He had defeated Ling yunkong with just his cultivation and intent realm.</p><p>the power of the fusion of five kinds of mentality is indeed much stronger than that of four kinds of mentality. It’s a pity that the water mentality is still a little weak. If it was on the same level as the other mentalities, the power that it could unleash would be even more terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The four of them headed north of Lishui City. After leaving the city, the four of them changed their appearances and changed their clothes.</p><p>The sisters ‘looks had become much more ordinary and less eye-catching. Lu Ming had also turned into a young man in his thirties. He kept going north and crossed the myriad Lake plain. After flying for about a million miles, he stopped at a small island in the middle of a Lake.</p><p>This small island in the middle of the lake was very peaceful and suitable for living in seclusion.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei planned to live here temporarily.</p><p>There was plenty of water vapor here. Lu Ming also planned to cultivate here for a period of time.</p><p>The four of them then settled down.</p><p>Every day, Lu Ming would sit cross-legged on the surface of the lake to comprehend the concept of water.</p><p>To him, he couldn’t afford to waste any time.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect’s yin and yang formation could only last for five years. However, almost half a year had passed. Lu Ming felt that time was too tight. He had to seize every bit of time to cultivate and improve himself as soon as possible.</p><p>As for Xiao Zhan, he would disguise himself and go out every day to gather information.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated quietly every day and made great progress in the water concept.</p><p>One day, Xiao Zhan returned with a worried look on his face.</p><p>Seeing this, ah ke and ah Lei quickly asked Xiao Zhan what had happened. At first, Xiao Zhan didn’t say anything, but he had no choice but to tell the truth.</p><p>It turned out that he had heard an important piece of news when he went out just now.</p><p>Ling yunkong had returned. He seemed to have invited the experts of the floating mountain martial school to come here. He had captured many disciples of the Xiao family who had left. At this moment, Ling yunkong was holding the disciples of the Xiao family in custody. He had released the news that Lu Shaoqing, Xiao Zhan, and the others should return. Otherwise, he would kill all the disciples of the Xiao family.</p><p>“Despicable! This Ling yunkong is actually so despicable!”</p><p>A-Qing gritted her teeth.</p><p>No matter what, Ling yunkong was still one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school. They did not expect him to be so despicable and shameless. After being defeated by Lu Ming, he actually used the Xiao family’s disciples to threaten them.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s face was full of worry, but Lu Ming’s expression was very calm.</p><p>“You guys stay here, I’ll go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, little brother Lu, you’ve helped us too much. I can’t repay your kindness in this life. I can’t let you take any more risks!</p><p>Xiao Zhan firmly shook his head.</p><p>“That’s right, big brother Lu. That Ling yunkong must have found someone stronger than him. If you go, Won’t You Be in danger?”</p><p>A-Qing also said.</p><p>it’s fine. I’m just going to take a look. I won’t show my face if I’m not confident!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>They hesitated after hearing Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you guys wait here for my news!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and rose into the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
