I’m your biological son!”</p><p>...</p><p>Xiao Hongyun pleaded.</p><p>Grandpa, I beg you, please let me go. It’s not my fault. My father told me to do this. Yes, it’s all him. I was forced by him!</p><p>Xiao ning screamed and begged, pushing all the blame onto Xiao Hongyun.</p><p>“Bastard, how dare you slander me? if it wasn’t for the fact that you could get into Ling yunkong’s good books, would I have done that?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun looked at Xiao ning in disbelief and anger.</p><p>you were the one who gave me this idea from the start. You were the one who told me to make use of ah Lei and ah Zhen. That’s why I invited Ling yunkong to our house. It was all your idea. Grandpa, if you want to kill him, then kill him. I’m innocent. I’m the last man in the Xiao family. I still want to pass on the Xiao family’s heir!</p><p>Desolate ning shouted.</p><p>“Animal, animal, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun roared and pounced towards Xiao ning.</p><p>“Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”</p><p>Xiao ning also rushed toward Xiao Hongyun. The two of them were entangled in a physical fight since their cultivation had been crippled.</p><p>“My family is unfortunate, my family is unfortunate!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s face was dejected, as if he had suddenly aged a few decades.</p><p>After a long time, Xiao Zhan’s eyes revealed a decisive look. A sword appeared in his hand and he said, ” “What’s the use of two scums in this world?”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light flashed, and two heads flew high up into the air with disbelief.</p><p>After killing Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning, Xiao Zhan’s body staggered as if he had lost all his strength.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Ah ke and ah Lei quickly supported Xiao Zhan.</p><p>“Senior Xiao, you can’t fall. The Xiao family, ah Zhen and ah Lei still need you to take care of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xiao Zhan took a deep breath to calm himself down and said, ” that’s right. Ah Lei and ah Zhen are the hope of the Xiao family. Nothing must happen to them. Let’s leave Lishui City and get away from the floating mountain!</p><p>“I’ll send you guys off first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the four of them took advantage of the darkness and left the Xiao family. However, just as they left the Xiao family, a bright sword light slashed towards them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He used his vital essence to roll Xiao Zhan and the other two to the side.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sword light slashed toward the Xiao family, leaving a deep sword mark. Half of the Xiao family was cut in half.</p><p>A group of figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>Their gazes were cold, and their bodies emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“The people from the floating mountain!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s expression changed.</p><p>it seems like Ling Kai and the others are dead. Luckily, I was worried and rushed over personally. Otherwise, you guys would have really escaped.</p><p>A cold voice came from the distance. A young man in a white robe was waving a folding fan as he walked in the air.</p><p>“Ling yunkong!”</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei cried out in alarm, their faces turning even uglier and even more desperate.</p><p>Ling yunkong, one of the top ten heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain martial school, had actually come personally.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Around the Xiao family, many figures appeared in a flash and flew into the sky, looking over.</p><p>The movement of the sword earlier was too loud. Everyone within a hundred miles could hear it. They all rushed over to see what had happened.</p><p>“The people from the floating mountain!”</p><p>“Ling yunkong! That’s Ling yunkong!”</p><p>Ling yunkong has come personally. The Xiao family is completely finished!</p><p>Someone recognized Ling yunkong and exclaimed in shock.</p><p>brother Lu, hurry up and leave!</p><p>Xiao Zhan called out to Lu Ming anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was not bad, but he was definitely not Ling yunkong’s match.</p><p>Ling yunkong was one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school. His combat strength was extremely terrifying. Many of the older generation were not his match.</p><p>“The top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain sect?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. There was a hint of fighting spirit and anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>The floating mountain sect was the Overlord of the central continent. It had an Emperor in charge and was on the same level as the Emperor sky divine Palace and the sky corpse sect. Lu Ming was very curious about the level of the geniuses in such a force.</p><p>“Leave? Today, none of you will be able to escape!”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s voice was cold. His eyes swept across the room and finally landed on a ‘ke and a’ Lei. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>He had played with countless beautiful women in his life, but he had never played with such a pair of pure and lovely twins. Just thinking about them made him feel excited.</p><p>old man, you should kill yourself. And, that brat, kill himself too. That way, I can still leave you with an intact corpse!</p><p>Ling yunkong said indifferently.</p><p>hehe, this is the virtue of one of the ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school. I’ve finally seen it today, but it’s really disappointing!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sighed.</p><p>In the air, the expressions of more than ten experts of the floating mountain sect changed.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s face darkened as well. He glared at Lu Ming coldly and said, good, kid, you’re good. With your words, I won’t let you die. I’ll let you live, but I’ll make you regret living!</p><p>“Ling Kai said the same thing before, but he’s a dead dog now. I hope you have the right to say that!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“Attack and cripple him!”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he waved his hand.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An elder strode forward with a steel fork in his hand. His aura rose and a powerful pressure pressed down on Lu Ming. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>Sixth level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>This elder’s cultivation had reached the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The old man waved his steel fork and smashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>brother Lu, be careful!</p><p>Xiao Zhan and the Xiao sisters cried out in unison, worried.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a long essential core spear was condensed. The long spear swept out and hit the steel fork.</p><p>With a clang, the steel fork trembled violently and was sent flying. Lu Ming rose into the air, his long spear turning into a ray of light with a faint Dragon’s Roar.</p><p>It was a high-grade demigod martial technique, the dazzling Dragon Spear art.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear broke through the old man’s defense and killed him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle from afar were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was very powerful. He had killed a sixth level spirit embryo realm cultivator with one shot.</p><p>Such a Young heaven’s favorite would not be unknown in the entire central continent.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes flickered slightly as well. It was apparent that Lu Ming’s cultivation had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to do it myself today!”</p><p>Ling yunkong said. He was only slightly surprised, but he did not take Lu Ming seriously.</p><p>That was because he could kill an ordinary sixth level spirit embryo realm cultivator with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ling yunkong took a step forward. The sky trembled violently, and the world began to shake.</p><p>“Ling yunkong is about to make his move!”</p><p>Some people exclaimed, but more people’s eyes were shining.</p><p>The battle of Providence had just passed half a year ago. During this time, the entire central continent was very peaceful, as if all the geniuses had gone into seclusion. It was a complete opposite from before the battle of Providence had begun.</p><p>Before the battle of Providence began, the prodigies would battle each other. Battles were endless, and there were battles between peerless prodigies every day.</p><p>However, after the war of Providence, it became completely silent.</p><p>All of the geniuses seemed to be digesting what they had obtained from the battle of Providence and were in seclusion to improve their cultivation. In the past six months, it was rare to see some of the top geniuses fight.</p><p>Was Ling yunkong going to make a move now?</p><p>After the battle of Providence, countless people were curious about what realm Ling yunkong had reached.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
