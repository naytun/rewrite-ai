The two spiders were completely suppressed and in danger.</p><p>...</p><p>this is a good opportunity. We can take the spirit refining fruit here!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>there shouldn’t be any other spiritual god level Gorefiend spiders in there, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, I’m very sensitive to the aura of living beings. I can’t be wrong!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang nodded.</p><p>alright, the three of us will attack at the same time to get the God refining fruit. Then, we will break out of this encirclement together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them had to work together to have a chance. Otherwise, the three cold-blood Hall experts would definitely attack them. If they did not work together, they would not be able to escape.</p><p>With a flash, the three of them pounced down the valley at the same time, their figures like lightning.</p><p>“Great circle of spirit embryo!”</p><p>As soon as he made his move, Lu Ming realized that the aura of the pure and ethereal spirit was much stronger than before. He had clearly reached the great circle of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>It was obvious that the jingkongling had refined the sky Vermillion fruit and achieved a breakthrough in her cultivation.</p><p>As soon as the three of them attacked, the three from cold-blood Hall noticed them.</p><p>goddess Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, and Lu Shaoqing! You damned juniors! Don’t even think about it!</p><p>The big bearded man roared.</p><p>The three cold-blood Hall experts were shocked when they saw the three of them.</p><p>They had never expected that there would be three top experts of the younger generation lying in ambush here, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s quintessential essence burst forth and rolled forward like a ribbon. A few soul-refining fruits fell into his hands and he kept them.</p><p>Deity Tan Xiang and Jing kongling were extremely fast as well. Quintessential essence swirled around and spiritual refinement fruits landed in their hands.</p><p>“Pick it!”</p><p>Without Lu Ming’s instruction, dandan had already pounced forward with a loud cry. She kept grabbing the soul-refining fruits and stuffing them into her mouth.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The bearded man’s eyes were red. He roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>There was also a blood-robed elder who charged towards Jing kongling and goddess Tan Xiang.</p><p>As for the injured middle-aged man whom Lu Ming, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin had met on their way, he was the most powerful among the three of them. He had fought two bloodghost spiders alone.</p><p>At this moment, one of the spiders was already on the verge of death. Only the other Spider was fighting with the middle-aged man.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The severely injured and dying bloodghost Spider suddenly exploded, and the sky was filled with blood-red light. The middle-aged man’s face turned pale when the blood-red light shone on him. The next moment, a trace of green gas appeared. He had been poisoned.</p><p>The remaining Gorefiend Spider screeched and absorbed the blood light. Its injuries healed quickly and its combat strength increased greatly. For a moment, it was in a stalemate with the middle-aged man.</p><p>In the valley, Lu Ming burst out with four streams of dragon energy and punched with all his might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He exchanged a blow with the bearded man, and both of them trembled and retreated.</p><p>The bearded man’s combat strength was about the same as the bald man’s. However, Lu Ming did not use his full strength. That was why they were on par.</p><p>“Your cultivation level?”</p><p>Even so, the bearded man was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming’s combat strength to be so terrifying that he could fight with him.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>He turned into a blood-red Lion and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing Divine Art. The five-colored concept swirled around him as he fought the blood-colored Lion.</p><p>After several moves, it was still a draw.</p><p>On the other side, goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling were fighting the elder in blood robes.</p><p>The blood-robed elder’s combat power was slightly stronger than the bearded man’s, but the sandalwood fairy and the pure spatial spirit were also extremely powerful.</p><p>After the pure space spirit broke through to the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, its combat strength had increased greatly. Even if it was alone, it could compete with a weaker first level spiritual God Realm martial artist.</p><p>As for fairy Tan Xiang, although she focused on alchemy, her battle strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s body glowed with a powerful, colorful light.</p><p>This was a formation carved with her body. Clearly, there was an extremely powerful formation inside fairy Tan Xiang’s body.</p><p>There was a bias for inscription Masters.</p><p>For example, some of them were inclined towards alchemy, some were inclined towards refining weapons, and some were inclined towards refining talisman scrolls …</p><p>But no matter which aspect it was, inscriptions and arrays must be studied and cultivated, because it was the foundation of an inscriber and where their combat power lay.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s inscription formation was also extremely terrifying. The mental energy fire between her eyebrows danced and formed a powerful mental energy storm.</p><p>what a strong mental energy. Fairy Tan Xiang is definitely perfect at every level!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling teamed up to fight the blood-robed elder, and they even had the upper hand.</p><p>For a moment, the three sides were in a stalemate. However, no one stopped dandan and she excitedly picked the spirit refining fruit.</p><p>There were also some remaining Gorefiend spiders, but they were not strong and were killed by dandan’s formation.</p><p>The eyes of the three cold-blood Hall disciples turned red.</p><p>They had put in so much effort but they had not even obtained a single spirit refining fruit. Now, Lu Ming and the rest were about to pick all of them. They were furious.</p><p>“I don’t care what kind of heaven’s favorites you are, you will all die today!”</p><p>The bearded man roared angrily and launched a frenzied attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>Killing intent flickered in Lu Ming’s eyes. He wondered if he should unleash his full power and kill this bearded man.</p><p>In the end, he decided to give up. The big-bearded man might not spread the news alone, but now that he had unleashed his full power and revealed his nine Dragon bloodline, if others saw it, it might really spread.</p><p>Lu Ming punched the bearded man again and again, stopping him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The middle-aged man who was fighting the blood Ghost Spider roared. A Pagoda appeared above his head. The pagoda was blood red and had five golden chakras on it.</p><p>This middle-aged man’s bloodline was at the fifth level of the divine level, which was higher than that of the big bearded man and the blood-robed elder. His battle prowess was also much stronger.</p><p>He transformed into a blood-red Pagoda, exuding a terrifying aura, and pressed down on the spider.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The pagoda trembled and successfully suppressed the spider under it. Blood light flashed as if it was bombarding the refined Spider.</p><p>At this time, dandan was still frantically picking the spirit refining fruit.</p><p>Soon, more than a hundred spirit refining fruits were almost all picked by dandan.</p><p>“The wind is blowing!”</p><p>Dandan shouted. He had finished picking the spirit refining fruit and was about to run out.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The space trembled and blood light flashed. The blood-red Pagoda pressed down on dandan.</p><p>As for the Gorefiend Spider, it had already been severely injured by the blood-red Tower.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Dandan was shocked and ran toward Lu Ming with a Swoosh.</p><p>“Fairy, miss Kong Ling, let’s rush out together!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few punches in succession and then rushed towards fairy Tan Xiang and Jing kongling. He planned to group up and rush out together.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The big bearded man roared and chased after him.</p><p>The blood-robed elder was also tightly holding onto fairy Tan Xiang and the pure spatial spirit.</p><p>The blood-colored Pagoda trembled and tried to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the side of the two and threw a few punches, causing the blood bubble elder to tremble and retreat slightly.</p><p>Then, he was about to rush to the South, but a blood-colored Pagoda pressed down on him, exuding a terrifying aura.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
