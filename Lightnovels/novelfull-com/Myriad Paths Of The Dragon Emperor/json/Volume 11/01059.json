He didn’t even activate his bloodline. I didn’t expect there to be such a powerful figure in the East barren.</p><p>I’ve heard that the Emperor God is a direct descendant of a Martial Emperor in the East continent. He is very talented and is ranked second in the East continent!</p><p>“What? Emperor gods could only be ranked second in the East continent? I thought he was the number one heaven’s favorite in the East barren. Then who’s first?”</p><p>the one in first place is called Lu Ming. It’s amazing. Di Shen is so powerful, but Lu Ming can suppress him. What kind of genius is he? ”</p><p>it seems that this generation is indeed a great era. Even the East continent has risen and given birth to geniuses like Lu Ming and the Emperor God!</p><p>Many people sighed and marveled at the power of the Emperor God. They were also curious about how handsome Lu Ming was, who could suppress the Emperor God.</p><p>this blood Luo is really unlucky. He has lost a few rounds in the past year. A year ago, he was defeated by a sovereign called Lu Shaoqing. Now, he’s defeated by an Emperor God!</p><p>this is how geniuses fight for hegemony. The weak will sooner or later become the stepping stones of the stronger!</p><p>Some people who had a grudge with cold-blood Hall deliberately dug out the secrets of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have another strong opponent in the future!</p><p>Demon mountain junyue said, his eyes filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“This person is indeed terrifying!”</p><p>Yin BUPO nodded. His combat strength was almost the same as Xue Luo Zi’s, so he was probably no match for an Emperor God.</p><p>Tianxia Academy has released news that tianxu cave is open. Anyone who passes can enter the marrow cleansing pool once!</p><p>Suddenly, a piece of news came and caused an uproar.</p><p>“What? The tianxu cave is open, and those who have passed can enter the marrow cleansing pool. Is this for real?”</p><p>it’s true. It’s absolutely true. This news was passed down by the headmaster of Tianxia Academy.</p><p>“Heavens, it’s great that I can enter the marrow cleansing pool. I want to try it too.”</p><p>you? stop dreaming. Everyone in the world knows that the tianxu cave of Tianxia Academy is frighteningly difficult. Only a few people have ever passed it!</p><p>you won’t know if you don’t try. I heard that tianxu cave doesn’t look at strength. Everyone who enters tianxu cave will face a different situation. There was even a martial king who managed to break through tianxu cave!</p><p>“That’s true, let’s go and try!”</p><p>After a heated discussion, countless people flew in one direction.</p><p>“Tianxu cave? Marrow cleansing pool? I didn’t expect that the Tianxia Academy would actually open the marrow cleansing pool. I can fight for it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Tianxia Academy’s marrow cleansing pool was famous all over the world.</p><p>Entering the marrow cleansing pool could allow a warrior’s body to transform, complete sublimation, and finally reach perfection.</p><p>One of the most important conditions to break through to the Martial Emperor realm was that one’s physical body had to reach the complete ninth grade.</p><p>However, after the body reached level nine, it was actually very difficult to reach perfection. There would be a threshold that was not easy to cross. However, in the marrow cleansing pool, the body could be perfected, and the first foundation to break through to the Martial Emperor realm could be laid.</p><p>This moved many of the heaven’s favorites who wanted to become emperors.</p><p>For example, Jing kongling, Jun Yue, etc.</p><p>Even those heaven’s favorites who knew that they had no chance of breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm were tempted. Who wouldn’t want to have a stronger body?</p><p>Lu Ming was also tempted because his physical body had reached the ninth grade. If he could cultivate his physical body to perfection in the marrow cleansing pool, he would have fewer things to do in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming also got off the Jade platform and followed the crowd in a certain direction.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a huge mountain peak.</p><p>This mountain was extremely huge, and the bottom of the mountain was at least a hundred miles wide.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge cave. It was the Tiangang cave.</p><p>From this side of the tianxu cave to the other side of the mountain, it was a hundred miles long. As long as one passed through the tianxu cave from this side and came out from the other side, they would be considered to have passed the tianxu cave and would be able to obtain a quota to enter the marrow cleansing pool.</p><p>However, the tianxu cave was extremely mysterious. It was said that everyone who entered would encounter different things. Since ancient times, there were very few people who could pass through it, and it was extremely wonderful.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>A young man rushed into the tianxu cave, but not long after, a light flashed outside the tianxu cave, and he was transported out.</p><p>He returned to the crowd dejectedly.</p><p>“What’s going on? What did you encounter?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>as soon as I entered, I met a powerful fierce beast. It severely injured me with one slap, so I was teleported out. Fortunately, the injury was fake, and I recovered as soon as I came out!</p><p>The man replied.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Another person rushed in, but after a while, he was also teleported out.</p><p>Someone asked him, and he said that he had encountered a sword and cut him down.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. Sure enough, everyone encountered a different situation when they entered. It was impossible to know what flaws, weaknesses, and rules there were.</p><p>Following that, the paragons entered the tianxu cave one after another, but all of them failed. Not a single one succeeded.</p><p>Jun Yue and the other heaven’s favorites didn’t move. Instead, they stood in the air and watched quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. He was not in a hurry and let the others go first.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming closed his eyes and tried to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>For ten consecutive days, countless people went in, but not a single one succeeded. They all failed, and all of them were dejected.</p><p>Chu Kuang, Zhang Wenjin, and the other third-grade heaven’s favorites also entered, but they all failed.</p><p>“Yin BUPO has gone in!”</p><p>Someone called out, and many people were shocked.</p><p>Finally, a second-grade heaven’s favorite made his move.</p><p>Yin BUPO went in for a very long time. Half an hour had passed and he still hadn’t come out.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that Yin BUPO can make it through?”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>It was very possible that he had not come out after half an hour. It was possible for him to make it through. Second-grade geniuses were indeed different.</p><p>Some people simply went to the other side of the mountain peak to wait, to see if Yin BUPO would come out from the tianxu cave’s exit.</p><p>However, at this moment, a light flashed at the entrance of tianxu cave, and Yin BUPO was also transported out.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Yin BUPO sighed. He had also failed.</p><p>this Tiangang cave is too difficult. Even a second-grade heaven’s favorite can’t pass it!</p><p>it’s indeed too difficult. I wonder if the top five young warriors can make it through.</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blood-red light rushed in.</p><p>“It’s blood Luo Zi!”</p><p>Someone recognized it.</p><p>Apparently, Xue Luo Zi had recovered from his injuries. He also appeared here, planning to explore the Tiangang cave.</p><p>Unfortunately, just like Yin BUPO, he was also teleported out after half an hour and failed.</p><p>Next, Jun Yue, goddess Tan Xiang, and the others tried, but they all failed.</p><p>“Wu chengkong has gone in!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>A white-robed young man with a long sword on his back stepped into Tiangang cave.</p><p>Wu chengkong was the number one genius of the tianwu sword faction.</p><p>This was an extremely terrifying and powerful figure who was extremely famous in the central continent.</p><p>There were strong and weak second-grade heaven’s favorites, and Wu chengkong was undoubtedly the most powerful one.</p><p>He was known as one of the strongest people under the five young Giants.</p><p>Everyone watched quietly, wondering if Wu chengkong could make it through the Tiangang cave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
