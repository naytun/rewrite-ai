They attacked together and frantically pounced into the valley.</p><p>“Haha, the spirit refining fruit is mine!”</p><p>One of the burly men laughed as he reached for one of the fruits.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a dark red light flashed from the tree and pounced at the burly man.</p><p>“What? A bloodghost Spider?”</p><p>The burly man was shocked and used all his strength to slash at the spider.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Gorefiend Spider was cut in half.</p><p>However, the next moment, dozens of bloodghost spiders pounced at the burly man as if they had stirred a hornet’s nest. Some of them were extremely powerful.</p><p>He was not the only one. The other five were also attacked by the bloodghost spiders.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The six of them roared and used all their strength to fight the bloodghost Spider.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of bloodghost spiders had died at their hands. However, one of the ninth tier spirit embryo realm elders let out a blood-curdling scream as the bloodghost spiders pierced through the space between his brows. Then, countless bloodghost spiders climbed onto his body, and in an instant, the elder’s corpse was gone.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The others were shocked and wanted to retreat.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, there was an intense sound of something breaking through the air. A dark red light flickered rapidly.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The five experts were all killed in an instant.</p><p>“A spiritual God Realm bloodghost Spider!” He exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could clearly see that the one who had attacked was also a bloodghost Spider. It was the size of a fist and had an exceptionally powerful aura.</p><p>The six masters were all dead in an instant. They were devoured by the dense horde of bloodghost spiders. The valley quieted down again. The bloodghosts climbed up the God-refining tree again and seemed to have become one with it. From a distance, no bloodghost spiders could be seen.</p><p>Three cold-blood Hall experts appeared in the air.</p><p>“You’re really trash!”</p><p>One of them coldly shouted.</p><p>this won’t do. It won’t consume much of the spiders ‘strength. There are three spiritual God Realm spiders here. I have to be at the spiritual God Realm to consume their strength!</p><p>The big bearded man said.</p><p>“Then let’s go and attract the spiritual God Realm martial artists!”</p><p>After making up his mind, a spiritual herb appeared in the big bearded man’s hand. Suddenly, a green light filled the air and rushed into the sky.</p><p>that’s Green heaven grass, a level 9 spirit herb!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The spiritual herb in the big bearded man’s hand was actually a level nine spiritual herb.</p><p>A fiery light flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. If he had this level-nine spiritual herb, his physical body might be able to break through to the ninth grade.</p><p>The three cold-blood Hall disciples flew South this time, but they came back soon and hid in the mountains.</p><p>Not long after, two streaks of light flew over from the South at an extremely fast speed. Their speed was terrifyingly fast, and their terrifying might was vast and incomparably powerful.</p><p>“Two eagles!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw that they were two eagle-like demonic beasts.</p><p>“It’s the sky Eagle castle’s experts!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang whispered.</p><p>The two eagles were obviously spiritual god level existences. Their auras were as heavy as mountains, and their eagle eyes were as sharp as lightning as they scanned the surroundings.</p><p>When they saw the spirit refining fruit in the valley, they immediately burst into a fiery light.</p><p>Kaka, it’s the spirit refining fruit! It’s actually the spirit refining fruit! What a great opportunity!</p><p>A giant Purple Eagle laughed.</p><p>“We’ll split it evenly!”</p><p>A giant Blue Eagle said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle nodded. Then, the two giant eagles rushed into the valley.</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the valley, a dense horde of Gorefiend spiders rushed at them.</p><p>“Die, bloodghost Spider!”</p><p>The giant Blue Eagle opened its mouth and spat out a ray of blue light. Wherever the light passed, the temperature dropped sharply, and the bloodghost spiders were also frozen into blocks of ice.</p><p>??…</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle flapped its wings, and endless purple lightning spread out. The spiders were swept by the lightning and turned into ashes.</p><p>The ordinary Gorefiend spiders could not stop the two giant eagles at all. Thousands of them were killed in an instant.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, three rays of light flashed out and attacked the two giant eagles.</p><p>not good! It’s a spiritual God-tier bloodghost Spider!</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle roared and flapped its wings. The terrifying lightning turned into three lightning Spears and stabbed at the three bloodghost spiders.</p><p>At the same time, the giant Blue Eagle launched a terrifying attack. A blue ice River wound around the three spiders, trying to freeze them.</p><p>However, the three Gorefiend spiders were extremely powerful. They broke through the lightning and ice River and attacked the two giant eagles.</p><p>The two giant eagles howled in anger as they fought with all their might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two giant eagles and three Gorefiend spiders collided with each other. They flew into the sky and fought fiercely.</p><p>The two giant eagles and three Gorefiend spiders should all be at the first tier of level eight, equivalent to the first tier of the spiritual God Realm. Their combat strength was similar, but the two giant eagles were even fewer in number, so they were at a disadvantage.</p><p>After thousands of them were killed, the three level-eight spiders seemed to be in a frenzy. They entangled the two giant eagles and fought fiercely.</p><p>After a few dozen moves, the giant Purple Eagle was scratched by the Gorefiend spider’s claws. Blood gushed out and its feathers flew in the air.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle went crazy. The divine beast blood in its body was boiling, and its body seemed to have turned into lightning. It clawed and almost pierced through a bloodghost Spider. Although the spider managed to Dodge, it left a wound and green liquid flowed out.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle roared angrily and tried to break out of the encirclement, but the three Gorefiend spiders were holding them back.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense.</p><p>In the end, one of the Gorefiend spiders seized the opportunity to open up a wound on the Eagle’s abdomen. The spider then crawled into the Eagle’s body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The giant Purple Eagle screeched as if it was in endless pain and struggled in the air.</p><p>“If we’re going to die, we’ll die together!”</p><p>In the end, the giant Purple Eagle roared, filling the sky with lightning. Its body expanded rapidly, and then exploded with a loud bang. Even the other two bloodghost spiders and the giant Blue Eagle were blown away by the terrible energy.</p><p>In the sky full of lightning, a bloodghost Spider could be seen in the air, but it was no longer breathing. It had been turned into a pile of charcoal.</p><p>The Gorefiend Spider that had charged into the purple Eagle’s body was also killed by the purple Eagle’s self-destruction.</p><p>Perishing together!</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>The remaining two Gorefiend spiders seemed to be extremely angry. They shrieked and pounced on the giant Blue Eagle.</p><p>The giant Blue Eagle roared and tried its best to escape, but it was in vain. It was entangled by two bloodghost spiders. In the end, one of the spiders was seriously injured by the giant Blue Eagle, but the giant Blue Eagle was also killed by the two spiders.</p><p>Two giant eagles of the eighth rank had died, just like that.</p><p>Of course, the Gorefiend Spider had also paid a heavy price.</p><p>“Haha, good!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, three cold-blood Hall experts appeared and pounced at the two spiders.</p><p>Previously, there were three bloodghost spiders and they were not confident. Now, they could finally attack.</p><p>Out of the three spiders, one was killed, one was heavily injured, and the last one was slightly injured. After all, the Blue Eagle was not to be trifled with.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
