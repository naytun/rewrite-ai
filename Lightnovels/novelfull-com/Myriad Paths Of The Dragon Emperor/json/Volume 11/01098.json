Lu Ming was transferred to the law enforcement Army as the commander, leading a team of a hundred people with Sun Lin following.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming took the transfer order and set off with Sun Lin.</p><p>Lu Ming did not feel anything. To him, the law enforcement Army was better and he had more freedom. He could walk around the holy city as he pleased. He would definitely be able to obtain more information.</p><p>Sun Lin, on the other hand, was listless and looked like he had a bleak future.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them arrived at the place where the law enforcement Army was stationed, the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>There were many law enforcement halls in the holy city. A team of 100 people was led by a commander. They were stationed in one law enforcement Hall and were responsible for law enforcement missions in a certain area of the holy city.</p><p>Lu Ming was the leader of this law enforcement team. He was mainly in charge of the northeast area of the holy city.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered, he saw a few figures sitting listlessly in the law enforcement Hall. He did not see anyone else.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, they only took a casual glance at Lu Ming and continued to sit listlessly.</p><p>“There are only a few of you. Where are the others?” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>One of them glanced at Lu Ming and said, ” “Who are you? Don’t you know that it’s a serious crime to break into the law enforcement Hall without permission?”</p><p>“I am the new commander. Let me ask you, where are the others?”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a token and shouted coldly.</p><p>“A new commander?”</p><p>Their eyes suddenly lit up, shining with greed. The blazing fire seemed to have invigorated them all, and they stood up one after another.</p><p>a new commander has arrived! Brothers, come out! We have money to spend again! someone shouted.</p><p>His voice spread far and wide. As soon as his voice fell, the sound of breaking air rang out. Figures rushed out from various rooms and from all corners of the law enforcement Hall. There were a total of eighty to ninety people.</p><p>As soon as these people appeared, they stared at Lu Ming and sun Lin with fiery eyes, as if they were burly men who had been thirsty for decades and had just seen a peerless and enchanting beauty.</p><p>haha, another unlucky fellow has been transferred here, and it’s a commander. You’ve come at the right time. Take out all your raw gemstones and treasures and share them with your brothers!</p><p>A brawny man who looked like an ape stepped out. His muscles bulged and he glared at Lu Ming with a fierce gaze.</p><p>hehe, you’re only a seventh level spirit embryo realm martial artist, yet you were transferred here to be a commander. I really don’t know who you’ve offended, but no matter who you’ve offended, since you’re here, hand over all your origin stones and treasures!</p><p>A white-haired old man in his 60s sneered.</p><p>haha, after we get the raw stone, let’s go and have a good meal and enjoy ourselves. How about it? ”</p><p>“That’s for sure. Damn it, I haven’t enjoyed it in a long time!”</p><p>The rest of the people were also in an uproar. They were all talking and looking at Lu Ming as if he was a piece of fat meat.</p><p>Sun Lin’s face was pale and Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Was this the law enforcement Army? This was the law enforcement Hall?</p><p>Lu Ming almost thought that he had come to a Bandit’s lair. These people actually wanted to Rob him. After observing carefully, he realized that this was undoubtedly the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“You guys want to Rob me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed an inexplicable smile.</p><p>you can understand it that way. Hurry up, or my fist will start to itch!</p><p>The gorilla-like man glared at Lu Ming unkindly.</p><p>The smile on Lu Ming’s face grew wider. He swept his gaze across the room and said, if that’s the case, then fine. Now, I’ll Rob you. Hand over all your storage rings!</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming said that, the entire place fell silent. Everyone looked at Lu Ming with their mouths agape. After a while, everyone burst into laughter.</p><p>haha, I didn’t hear wrongly, right? this seventh level spirit embryo realm guy actually wants to Rob us? ”</p><p>“Who does he think he is? Did he really think of himself as a commander? Aren’t you just as unlucky as us? you’ve offended someone you shouldn’t have!”</p><p>“What a joke!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black Gorilla Man took a step forward and his aura burst out. He waved his hand and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm. Among this group of people, he was at the top.</p><p>“Let’s see what you can do.”</p><p>The black Gorilla Man revealed a Savage expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He stretched out a hand and grabbed the black Gorilla man’s wrist at lightning speed. His vital essence burst forth and he grabbed the black Gorilla Man and threw him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black Gorilla Man was like a sandbag, heavily smashing onto the ground, causing the entire law enforcement Hall to shake violently. If it wasn’t for the powerful array inscribed in the law enforcement Hall, it would have exploded.</p><p>The black Gorilla Man fell to the ground and screamed. His cultivation and essential core were extremely fragile in Lu Ming’s hands. They had been completely scattered by Lu Ming. At this moment, his whole body seemed to be falling apart. He had no strength at all as he lay on the ground and wailed.</p><p>There was a sudden silence and everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock. The black Gorilla Man had a cultivation of the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, but he was actually defeated without any resistance in one move. How was this possible?</p><p>brothers, let’s attack together! This person’s combat strength is profound, and he must have a lot of money on him. Let’s attack!</p><p>The white-haired old man shouted and the eighty to ninety law enforcement soldiers followed suit. They swarmed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed over like a stream of light, his palm striking out.</p><p>Pa! “Pa!”</p><p>In the law enforcement Hall, the sound of rapid slapping, as well as wails and screams, were mixed together.</p><p>In less than a minute, 80 to 90 law enforcement soldiers were lying all over the law enforcement Hall, wailing on the ground. One side of their faces was puffed up, and they looked extremely miserable.</p><p>Sun Lin was dumbfounded by this scene, his mouth wide open.</p><p>Was Lu Ming’s cultivation at the seventh level of spirit embryo realm? Wasn’t his combat strength a little too strong?</p><p>In this group of law enforcement soldiers, there were five to six people with Great Perfection in their spirit embryo realm. The others were at least experts of the fourth level spirit embryo realm. However, they were completely defeated by Lu Ming in less than a minute. They were as weak as babies. This was too terrifying.</p><p>He felt that his brain was a little confused.</p><p>“You dare to fight with your father, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. Lu Ming now had the image of a burly man with a full beard. At this moment, his glare was rather intimidating.</p><p>He clenched his fist in the air and his essential core burst forth. The storage rings on the fingers of these law enforcement soldiers were all sucked over by Lu Ming.</p><p>If they wanted to Rob him, they had to be prepared to be robbed by him.</p><p>First, Lu Ming picked up the storage ring of the black Gorilla Man and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He was dumbfounded.</p><p>“This … Aren’t you a little too poor?”</p><p>Lu Ming glared at the Gorilla Man, completely speechless.</p><p>In the storage ring of the black Gorilla Man, there was almost nothing except for a few spiritual crystals.</p><p>There were no raw stones!</p><p>He didn’t have any good spirit weapons!</p><p>Not to mention precious pills and materials, there was nothing.</p><p>In any case, this was a storage ring with a great circle of spirit embryo realm. How could it be so poor?</p><p>Next, Lu Ming looked at the other people’s storage rings. Many of them were even poorer than the Gorilla Man.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. They were too poor. The lowest cultivation among these people was the fourth level spirit embryo realm. Why did it feel like they were even poorer than some martial King realm martial artists?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
