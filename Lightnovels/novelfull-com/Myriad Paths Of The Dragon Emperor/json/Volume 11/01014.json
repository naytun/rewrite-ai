Naturally, it had an extraordinary atmosphere. However, Lu Ming was still a little stunned after seeing it.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of him was the boundless water. Above the boundless water, there was a huge divine mountain floating in the air.</p><p>This huge mountain had no end in sight. It was like the legendary divine mountain where ancient gods lived. It was suspended in the air thousands of meters high.</p><p>The floating mountain, as its name suggested, was really a floating divine mountain.</p><p>From a distance, the floating mountain was filled with clouds and water vapor. Under the sunlight, rainbows hung in the sky. At first glance, there were countless rainbows, which were extremely dazzling, like a paradise on earth.</p><p>“What a great floating mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh in admiration.</p><p>“Hahaha! Let’s go!”</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed and flew towards the floating mountain with Lu Ming.</p><p>With Chu Kuang leading the way, they naturally entered the floating mountain.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice of disbelief was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and could not help but find it funny. Wasn’t that Ling yunkong?</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, you dare to come to the floating mountain?”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes were wide open. He was stunned for a moment before he turned around and saw Chu Kuang. His expression changed.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Brother Lu is my friend. Do you have a problem with him? I’ve heard a few things about you from brother Lu!”</p><p>Chu Kuang looked at Ling yunkong and licked his lips. An ominous glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s expression changed again. His face turned pale and bloodless. He hurriedly said, no, Lu Shaoqing is your friend, senior Chu. How could I have any objections? I have no objections!</p><p>When Ling yunkong saw Chu Kuang, he was like a mouse seeing a cat. He was scared to death.</p><p>“Hmph, in the future, you’d better not use the name of the floating mountain martial school to do evil things. Also, brother Lu’s friend, if you dare to touch a hair on your head again, I will cut You Down with my knife!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes flickered with an ominous glint as he looked at Ling yunkong.</p><p>“I don’t dare, I definitely don’t dare!”</p><p>Ling yunkong nodded his head repeatedly, cold sweat dripping down his back.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Chu Kuang coldly shouted. Ling yunkong hurriedly ran away in fear.</p><p>“This Ling yunkong seems to be very afraid of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’ve taught him a few times in the past. There was also a heaven’s favorite who was similar to Ling yunkong. The two of them were always up to no good. I chopped off one of them. He was afraid that I would chop off his head too!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Ling yunkong was extremely afraid of Chu Kuang.</p><p>Chu Kuang’s innate talent was much greater than Ling yunkong’s. Even if he killed Ling yunkong, the higher-ups of the floating mountain martial school wouldn’t stand up for him.</p><p>The floating mountain was really huge. The two of them flew on the mountain for hundreds of thousands of miles and came to the edge of a cliff. On the edge of the cliff, there was a courtyard.</p><p>“Wenjing, I’m here!”</p><p>Chu Kuang called out as they arrived at the courtyard.</p><p>Not long after, the door of the courtyard opened, and a young woman walked out.</p><p>The young woman had a graceful figure and skin as white as snow. She was very beautiful in a light yellow dress.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Zhang Wenjin, ranked third among the top ten proud Children of Heaven of the floating mountain sect, was this woman?</p><p>Zhang Wenjin was one of the three geniuses of the floating mountain martial school who were at least a third-class heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Brother Chu, you’re here. You’re two days late!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>haha, don’t blame me for being quiet. I just made a new friend and drank with him for two more days. So, I rushed over!</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed and continued to introduce.</p><p>Wenjin, this is brother Lu, Lu Shaoqing. Brother Lu, this is my Junior Sister, Zhang Wenjin!</p><p>Chu Kuang said.</p><p>“You’re Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, Zhang Wenjin spoke up and looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Have you heard of my name before, Wenjin?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course I’ve heard of you. You suppressed Ling yunkong and defeated hai Ziming. Now, the news has spread all over the floating mountain martial school. How could I not know? ”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin smiled.</p><p>haha, I believe that brother Lu’s name will soon spread throughout the central continent!</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed.</p><p>Zhang Wenjing was slightly surprised. It seemed that Chu Kuang liked Lu Shaoqing very much.</p><p>Obviously, Zhang Wenjin had not heard about the battle for the pure water lotus throne. If she had, she would not be so surprised.</p><p>Wenjing, let’s go. Let’s set off for the pillar of heavens mountains!</p><p>Chu Kuang said.</p><p>This place was quite far from the heavenly Jewel Mountain, and he had to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>Zhang Wenjin nodded. Then, the three of them flew out of the floating mountain and headed Northwest.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall was located to the North of the floating mountain. It was an Overlord force close to the floating mountain and the East barren.</p><p>The sky Eagle castle was to the West of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Sky Pillar mountain was in the middle of cold-blood Hall and Sky Eagle Castle, Northwest of floating mountain. It was very far away. In the East barren, it was at least 50 regions away.</p><p>It was obviously impossible to travel such a distance by flying. It was too slow. They first took the teleportation array and teleported to the area near the pillar of heavens mountains. Then, they flew away.</p><p>The pillar of heavens mountains was a barren land, surrounded by mountains.</p><p>The three of them flew for several days before they suddenly stopped in front of a forest.</p><p>“What a strong smell of blood!”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s and Chu Kuang’s faces darkened as well. They could also smell the extremely thick stench of blood.</p><p>The smell of blood came from the mountain on the right.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Chu Kuang was the first to fly in that direction.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zhang Wenjin followed.</p><p>Not long after, they discovered the source of the bloody smell.</p><p>In the mountains, there was a stone castle. It was a small town with many people living in it, but now, everyone here was dead.</p><p>The town was filled with dead bodies.</p><p>The three of them swept their gazes across the sky. They estimated that no less than 100000 people had died. They had become corpses. The air was filled with blood Qi.</p><p>No wonder the three of them could smell the blood from so far away.</p><p>“Who is it? He actually killed so many people, most of whom were just ordinary people!”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin’s face turned pale.</p><p>“The blood Qi here is all gathering in one direction!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He observed carefully and realized that the blood Qi in the air was all gathering in one direction.</p><p>could it be the cold-blood Hall? ”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes moved.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall’s cultivation was mostly related to blood. However, due to its overbearing and terrifying cultivation, it had once incurred the dissatisfaction of other forces. They had joined forces to pressure cold-blood Hall, and they had also promised not to attack ordinary people. But now, most of the people who had died here were ordinary people.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other and slowly walked in the direction where the blood Qi was gathering.</p><p>“There’s a person there!”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin sent a message to the two.</p><p>In the center of the town, a middle-aged man in a blood-red robe was sitting cross-legged, and the smell of blood was soaring from his body. Endless blood Qi was gathering towards him and entering his body.</p><p>the bloodthirsty technique! It’s an expert from cold-blood Hall! Let’s go!</p><p>Chu Kuang muttered. His eyes revealed a trace of seriousness as he wanted to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man in the blood-red robe suddenly opened his eyes, and a cold and cruel killing intent burst out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
