He had brought many people who had offended him in the past, and none of them could last for five minutes. They all screamed and begged for mercy.</p><p>There were even some who wished for death, because being in the God Burning Earth flame was worse than death.</p><p>But now, more than ten minutes had passed and Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged calmly on the lava as if he was sitting on an ordinary spot.</p><p>this kid is too shocking. He’s a terrifying monster. We can’t let him leave here alive!</p><p>The Zhou clan leader’s heart trembled slightly.</p><p>“Father, I’ll go back first!”</p><p>Zhou Xin spoke from the side. Her eyes were filled with pity.</p><p>“Alright, you can go first!”</p><p>The Zhou clan leader said.</p><p>Zhou Xin took a glance at Lu Ming before she turned around and left.</p><p>“Let’s see how long you can endure this!”</p><p>The Zhou family head’s eyes were cold as he formed a seal with his hands. The essence sealing Pagoda shook and a few iron chains dropped from the top of the pagoda. They pierced Lu Ming’s shoulders and locked his body.</p><p>Lu Ming snorted and cast a cold glance at the Zhou family’s master. He then closed his eyes.</p><p>The Zhou family’s master had chained his physical body and used the essence sealing Pagoda to suppress his essential core and artistic conception. He did not have the slightest ability to resist. He was afraid that Lu Ming would escape.</p><p>Terrifying flames burned Lu Ming’s body from all around. He felt waves of unimaginable pain. At first, Lu Ming was suffering bitterly, but he slowly calmed down.</p><p>no matter how much pain he is in, it will be difficult to shake my heart. This is just a trial on my martial arts path. No matter how many tribulations he has to go through, I will not move!</p><p>Lu Ming gradually calmed down. In the end, he actually entered an ethereal state.</p><p>The pain left him. In the end, Lu Ming seemed to have become one with heaven and earth.</p><p>This was a wondrous state. According to ancient records, it was called Dao Comprehension.</p><p>Man and heaven were one, breaking away from the shackles of the physical body and comprehending the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>No one would have thought that burning Lu Ming with the God-Burning Earth flame would make his mind empty and he would enter a mysterious state.</p><p>Time passed by quickly!</p><p>Half an hour, one hour, five hours, half a day, one day …</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming was still sitting calmly on the lava, not moving.</p><p>The head of the Zhou family and the old man had been shocked and in disbelief at the beginning, but now they were numb.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting there, motionless. If not for the fact that there was still life in his body, they would have thought that he was dead.</p><p>this kid is really heaven-defying. He can actually withstand three days? ”</p><p>The old man said, his voice trembling.</p><p>all heaven’s favorites have extraordinary willpower. This man can defeat blood Luo, so he’s definitely terrifying. However, humans have their limits. He’s just holding it in, but I don’t believe he can hold it in forever!</p><p>The Zhou clan leader said.</p><p>He would never have dreamed that Lu Ming had already entered an ethereal state with the myriad tribulations on his body, like the face of Buddha.</p><p>They continued to wait.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was still sitting on the lava calmly.</p><p>The head of the Zhou family gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, are you going to hand it over or not? if you do, you won’t have to suffer this pain.”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan asked loudly.</p><p>This was the 32nd time he had asked this question in the past seven days.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes. Just like before, he could not be bothered with him.</p><p>“Fine, fine, you won’t say it, right? then stay here forever and suffer the burning of the God Burning Earth flame. Elder Shan, let’s go!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan waved his sleeve and strode out.</p><p>He had lost his patience.</p><p>The two of them left the place. Along the path, stone doors were closed, sealing off the area.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was locked and his cultivation level was suppressed. He could not cause any trouble. They planned to suppress Lu Ming here and see how long he could last.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the lava, unmoving.</p><p>He entered an extremely mysterious state and forgot everything. He instinctively felt the way of heaven and earth and the realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Time flowed like water, passing by quickly, day by day.</p><p>In the beginning, the clan leader of the Zhou family would come here every seven days to interrogate Lu Ming. Later on, he came once a month …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been suppressed here for a full year.</p><p>In a cave in the Zhou family, the Zhou family’s elder sat cross-legged, his palm emitting a raging flame that was burning a turtle shell.</p><p>This turtle shell was dandan.</p><p>“Little thief, I told you, you can’t do anything to me. Just wait for your death!”</p><p>Inside the turtle shell, dandan was clamoring.</p><p>The moment the flames dissipated, the Zhou family elder looked at the turtle shell in his hand with a serious expression.</p><p>In the past year, he had used all kinds of methods, but he couldn’t do anything to dandan, and he couldn’t kill it no matter what.</p><p>This made him extremely shocked, and he felt more and more afraid.</p><p>He had also heard that Lu Ming had been suppressed in the God-burning earthly flame for a year. He had not moved at all and had actually endured it for a whole year. All of this made the Zhou family elder feel a sense of fear and he could not calm down.</p><p>At this moment, a figure walked in. It was the clan leader of the Zhou clan.</p><p>“How’s that Lu Shaoqing kid?”</p><p>The Zhou family elder asked.</p><p>that brat still hasn’t said a word. He really deserves to die!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan gritted his teeth.</p><p>“I can’t let this continue. That kid and that turtle are both too evil. I can’t let them live. I’ll wait three more months. If that kid still doesn’t say anything, I’ll kill him. And that turtle, after I kill that kid, I’ll go out and ask a Paragon to exterminate that turtle!”</p><p>The Zhou clan elder spoke.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan nodded helplessly.</p><p>If they killed Lu Ming, they would not be able to obtain the grotto-heaven treasure and all their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>However, he was getting more and more flustered by keeping Lu Ming around. Lu Ming was too evil. It was too dangerous to keep him around.</p><p>In the underground cave, Lu Ming was still sitting cross-legged on the lava. The essence sealing Pagoda was suspended above his head, suppressing him.</p><p>His true Yuan, bloodline, and intent couldn’t be moved.</p><p>However, at this moment, a blood-colored light suddenly spread out from his spine.</p><p>Slowly, the blood-red light became more and more intense.</p><p>In the end, the blood-red light bloomed and covered the color of the purple-red lava. The entire underground cave was filled with blood-red light.</p><p>Then, a drop of blood seeped out from Lu Ming’s spine and floated above his head.</p><p>This drop of blood was bright red and crystal clear, but it seemed extremely cold. It exuded endless killing intent and a Supreme dignity. It was vast and mighty, filling the entire underground cave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes, which had been closed for a year, suddenly opened.</p><p>“The third bloodline, this is my third bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed. After sitting here for a year, his body and soul had gone through many trials. At this time, he had finally awakened his third bloodline.</p><p>However, what surprised Lu Ming was that his Blood Meridian did not have a chakra.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
