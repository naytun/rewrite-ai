The Supreme heavenly might filled the air, and many of the Zhou family disciples below trembled as if a great disaster was about to befall them.</p><p>...</p><p>However, facing such a terrifying lightning, Lu Ming did not care and rushed towards the Zhou family patriarch.</p><p>“Get lost! Get lost!”</p><p>The Zhou family elder was terrified. He rushed forward and roared.</p><p>He was terrified and aggrieved, but he did not dare to attack Lu Ming. Lu Ming was undergoing a lightning tribulation. If he attacked Lu Ming, he would be directly implicated in the lightning tribulation.</p><p>He was looking forward to Lu Ming being killed by the lightning tribulation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three bolts of lightning struck Lu Ming, but he was completely fine. He did not even slow down as he approached the Zhou family elder at top speed.</p><p>“Freak, freak!”</p><p>Zhou family elder was even more terrified.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply abnormal. He did not resist the lightning tribulation at all. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation was a sharp blade hanging over the head of every martial artist. Countless martial artists were turned into ashes under the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Before he broke through to the spiritual God Realm, he had prepared for hundreds of years. When the final lightning tribulation descended, he was also surrounded by danger and barely survived. How could it have been so easy?</p><p>“Haha, little thief, are you afraid now? just wait for your death!”</p><p>Dandan laughed loudly, extremely arrogant.</p><p>you’re the one who’ll die first. Go into the lightning tribulation!</p><p>The Zhou family elder hardened his heart and threw dandan into the lightning tribulation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Once he entered the lightning tribulation, the Tribulation clouds in the sky became even more terrifying. Lightning rumbled and filled the sky, causing the earth to shake.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Immediately, a bolt of lightning struck dandan.</p><p>Dandan stretched out her limbs and head, opened her mouth, and swallowed the lightning. Then she stretched lazily and shouted, ” ahaha, I’m finally out. I’ve been a coward for a year. Haha, this is so comfortable.</p><p>This guy’s body was emitting electricity, but his eyes were shining with excitement.</p><p>The Zhou family’s elder and the Zhou family’s people’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>pervert, demon, all of you are perverts. Go, go!</p><p>The Zhou family elder had lost his sense of propriety and only knew how to run for his life.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was too fast. He turned into a stream of light and closed in on the Zhou family elder in a few moments.</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds rolled and covered the Zhou family elder.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Zhou family elder roared in anger but it was useless. Thunder and lightning rumbled and a bolt of lightning shot towards the Zhou family elder. This bolt of lightning was even more terrifying than the one that was shooting towards him.</p><p>The Zhou family elder fought back with all his might and destroyed the lightning.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, nine bolts of lightning shot toward Lu Ming, but he easily blocked them.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had five intents on him and was extremely powerful. The lightning tribulation could not touch him at all.</p><p>“Gah!”</p><p>Suddenly, another cry rang out in the sky. A huge bird swooped down from the dark clouds and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>This bird was actually completely condensed from lightning. The lightning condensed into the bird, making it look like a real living creature.</p><p>The manifestation of lightning was a lightning tribulation that only Supreme geniuses would encounter.</p><p>no, the lightning tribulation. No, how could this be? ”</p><p>The Zhou family elder shouted in despair.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan also roared.</p><p>Lu Ming was going through a lightning tribulation. The Zhou family’s patriarch was enveloped by the heavenly Tribulation. He would definitely have to face a lightning tribulation. If it was an ordinary lightning tribulation, he might have some hope. However, he had no hope at all in a lightning tribulation.</p><p>He was desperate and angry, but immediately three more bolts of lightning struck down, and the Zhou family elder could only block them with all his might.</p><p>After the three bolts of lightning, Zhou family elder’s hair was disheveled and he spat out blood.</p><p>But in the sky, another nine bolts of lightning descended and struck at the Zhou family elder.</p><p>The Zhou family elder was terrified and immediately used bloodline fusion.</p><p>The Zhou family elder’s divine level bloodline was a Flame Vine, which was a fourth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>The blazing Flame Vine was hundreds of meters long. It was filled with flames and blasted towards the nine lightning bolts.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After nine bolts of lightning, the leaves and branches of the flame Vine withered. It was charred black and its aura was weak. It was almost struck to death.</p><p>On the other side, dandan was extremely relaxed. No matter what kind of lightning struck him, he would swallow it in one gulp and enjoy it.</p><p>Lu Ming was equally relaxed. He threw a punch and the giant lightning Eagle was blown apart.</p><p>“Go, you guys go quickly, leave this place!”</p><p>the Zhou family old ancestor knew that he had no hope. He shouted and hoped that the Zhou family head and the others would escape.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming hollered and strode towards the Zhou family elder.</p><p>“If I die, you won’t have an easy time either!”</p><p>The Zhou family patriarch roared madly. The flame Vine twisted wildly and lashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Since he was already under the lightning tribulation, he planned to die together with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. His murderous intent was like a tide, and his eyes had turned blood-red, looking extremely evil.</p><p>The third bloodline on his head, a drop of blood, started to wriggle and turned into a sword.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the sword. At that moment, endless killing intent surged into Lu Ming’s body, making his killing intent even stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood-red sword cut through the void and the space was torn apart, revealing a dark crack with an unfathomable depth.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The combat sword was invincible. It slashed through the Zhou family elder’s attack and cut the flame Vine into two.</p><p>Zhou family’s elder let out a shrill scream. The flame Vine disappeared, and Zhou family’s elder’s body reappeared. He spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The killing intent was like a tide. The Battle Sword slashed, and there was only a blood-red sword light in the sky, which was extremely stunning.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Zhou family elder didn’t even have time to scream before he was killed.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>In the distance, the clan leader of the Zhou family shouted at the top of his lungs when he saw this scene. The old ancestor of the Zhou family was the backbone of the Zhou family. Now that he was killed, even if Lu Ming died now, the Zhou family’s strength would be greatly reduced. They would be devoured by other forces.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared and devoured all of the Zhou family elder’s blood essence, vital essence, and energy.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and chased after an elder from the Zhou family.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and he realized that the Zhou family still had three spiritual God-level powerhouses.</p><p>The Zhou family had a total of five spirit God powerhouses. One of them was killed by Lu Ming a year ago. Now that the Zhou family’s elder was dead, there were three more left.</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan and two other elders.</p><p>The two elders were both in the first level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>A first level spiritual God was much slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming caught up to the elder in no time. The blood-red sword slashed down, and the elder screamed in pain. He was killed by Lu Ming before he could strike him with the lightning punishment.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and charged at another elder.</p><p>“Don’t! Spare me!”</p><p>The elder begged for mercy, but he was met with a blood-red sword light.</p><p>Blood gushed out, and the elder was killed.</p><p>The clan leader’s face was filled with despair. The Zhou family was finished. He knew that the Zhou family was completely finished. The only thing he could think of now was to run for his life.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was too fast. He could not escape at all.</p><p>Lu Ming caught up to him before he could fly ten thousand miles.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Bolts of lightning struck down on the Zhou clan leader. He tried his best to block them, but after two rounds of lightning tribulation, he was heavily injured.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and threw a punch, completely crippling the Zhou family’s clan leader’s cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
